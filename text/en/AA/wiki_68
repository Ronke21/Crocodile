<text>The Book of Mormon is a religious text of the Latter Day Saint movement, first published in 1830 by Joseph Smith as The Book of Mormon: An Account Written by the Hand of Mormon upon Plates Taken from the Plates of Nephi.

The book is one of the earliest and most well-known unique writings of the Latter Day Saint movement. The denominations of the Latter Day Saint movement typically regard the text primarily as scripture (sometimes as one of four standard works) and secondarily as a record of God&#x27;s dealings with ancient inhabitants of the Americas. The majority of Latter Day Saints believe the book to be a record of real-world history, with Latter Day Saint denominations viewing it variously as an inspired record of scripture to the linchpin or &quot;keystone&quot; of their religion. Independent archaeological, historical, and scientific communities have discovered little evidence to support the existence of the civilizations described therein. Characteristics of the language and content point toward a nineteenth-century origin of the Book of Mormon. Various academics and apologetic organizations connected to the Latter Day Saint movement nevertheless argue that the book is an authentic account of the pre-Columbian exchange world.

The Book of Mormon has a number of doctrinal discussions on subjects such as the fall of Adam and Eve, the nature of the Christian atonement, eschatology, agency, priesthood authority, redemption from physical and spiritual death, the nature and conduct of baptism, the age of accountability, the purpose and practice of communion, personalized revelation, economic justice, the anthropomorphic and personal nature of God, the nature of spirits and angels, and the organization of the latter day church. The pivotal event of the book is an appearance of Jesus Christ in the Americas shortly after his resurrection. Common teachings of the Latter Day Saint movement hold that the Book of Mormon fulfills numerous biblical prophecies by ending a global apostasy and signaling a restoration of Christian gospel.

The Book of Mormon is divided into smaller books — which are usually titled after individuals named as primary authors — and in most versions, is divided into chapters and verses. Its English text imitates the style of the King James Version of the Bible. The Book of Mormon has been fully or partially translated into at least 112 languages.

==Origin==


According to Smith&#x27;s account and the book&#x27;s narrative, the Book was originally engraved in otherwise unknown characters on golden plates by ancient prophets; the last prophet to contribute to the book, Moroni, had buried it in what is present-day Manchester, New York and then appeared in a vision to Smith in 1827, revealing the location of the plates and instructing him to translate the plates into English. A different view is that Smith authored the Book, drawing on material and ideas from his contemporary 19th-century environment, rather than translating an ancient record.

=== Conceptual emergence ===
According to Joseph Smith, in 1823, when he was seventeen years old, an angel of God named Moroni appeared to him and said that a collection of ancient writings was buried in a nearby hill in present-day Wayne County, New York, engraved on golden plates by ancient prophets. The writings were said to describe a people whom God had led from Jerusalem to the Western hemisphere 600 years before Jesus&#x27;s birth. Smith said this vision occurred on the evening of September 21, 1823, and that on the following day, via divine guidance, he located the burial location of the plates on this hill and was instructed by Moroni to meet him at the same hill on September 22 of the following year to receive further instructions, which repeated annually until 1827. Smith told his entire immediate family about this angelic encounter by the next night, and his brother William reported that the family &quot;believed all he [Joseph Smith] said&quot; about the angel and plates.

Smith and his family reminisced that as part of what Smith believed was angelic instruction, Moroni provided Smith with a &quot;brief sketch&quot; of the &quot;origin, progress, civilization, laws, governments... righteousness and iniquity&quot; of the &quot;aboriginal inhabitants of the country&quot; (referring to the Nephites and Lamanites who figure in the Book of Mormon&#x27;s primary narrative). Smith sometimes shared what he said he had learned through such angelic encounters with his family as well.

In Smith&#x27;s account, Moroni allowed him, accompanied by his wife Emma Hale Smith, to take the plates on September 22, 1827, four years after his initial visit to the hill, and directed him to translate them into English. Smith said the angel Moroni strictly instructed him to not let anyone else see the plates without divine permission. Neighbors, some of whom had collaborated with Smith in earlier treasure-hunting enterprises, tried several times to steal the plates from Smith while he and his family guarded them.

=== Dictation ===

As Smith and contemporaries reported, the English manuscript of the Book of Mormon was produced as scribes wrote down Smith&#x27;s dictation in multiple sessions between 1828 and 1829. The dictation of the extant Book of Mormon was completed in 1829 in between 53 and 74 working days.

Descriptions of the way in which Smith dictated the Book of Mormon vary. Smith himself called the Book of Mormon a translated work, but in public he generally described the process itself only in vague terms, saying he translated by a miraculous gift from God. According to some accounts from his family and friends at the time, early on, Smith copied characters off the plates as part of a process of learning to translate an initial corpus. For the majority of the process, Smith dictated the text by voicing strings of words which a scribe would write down; after the scribe confirmed they had finished writing, Smith would continue.

Smith, his first scribe Martin Harris &amp; his wife Emma all claimed that Joseph dictated by translating the ancient text through the use of the Urim and Thummim that accompanied the plates, prepared by the Lord for the purpose of translating. This &quot;Urim and Thummim,&quot; after the biblical divination stones, also called &quot;Nephite interpreters&quot; were described as two clear seer stones which Smith said he could look through in order to translate, bound together by a metal rim and attached to a breastplate.

Other accounts say that Smith used a seer stone he already possessed placed inside of a hat to darken the area around the stone. 

Beginning around 1832, both the interpreters and Smith&#x27;s own seer stone were at times referred to as the &quot;Urim and Thummim&quot;, and Smith sometimes used the term interchangeably with &quot;spectacles&quot;. Emma Smith&#x27;s and David Whitmer&#x27;s accounts describe Smith using the interpreters while dictating for Martin Harris&#x27;s scribing and switching to only using his seer stone(s) in subsequent translation. Religious studies scholar Grant Hardy summarizes Smith&#x27;s known dictation process as follows: &quot;Smith looked at a seer stone placed in his hat and then dictated the text of the Book of Mormon to scribes&quot;. Early on, Smith sometimes separated himself from his scribe with a blanket between them, as he did while Martin Harris, a neighbor, scribed his dictation in 1828. At other points in the process, such as when Oliver Cowdery or Emma Smith scribed, the plates were left covered up but in the open. During some dictation sessions the plates were entirely absent.In 1828, while scribing for Smith, Harris, at the prompting of his wife Lucy Harris, repeatedly asked Smith to loan him the manuscript pages of the dictation thus far. Smith reluctantly acceded to Harris&#x27;s requests. Within weeks, Harris lost the manuscript, which was most likely stolen by a member of his extended family. After the loss, Smith recorded that he lost the ability to translate and that Moroni had taken back the plates to be returned only after Smith repented. Smith later stated that God allowed him to resume translation, but directed that he begin where he left off (in what is now called the Book of Mosiah), without retranslating what had been in the lost manuscript.

Smith recommenced some Book of Mormon dictation between September 1828 and April 1829 with his wife Emma Smith scribing with occasional help from his brother Samuel Smith, though transcription accomplished was limited. In April 1829, Oliver Cowdery met Smith and, believing Smith&#x27;s account of the plates, began scribing for Smith in what became a &quot;burst of rapid-fire translation&quot;. In May, Joseph and Emma Smith along with Cowdery moved in with the Whitmer family, sympathetic neighbors, in an effort to avoid interruptions as they proceeded with producing the manuscript.

While living with the Whitmers, Smith said he received permission to allow eleven specific others to see the uncovered golden plates and, in some cases, handle them. Their written testimonies are known as the Testimony of Three Witnesses, who described seeing the plates in a visionary encounter with an angel, and the Testimony of Eight Witnesses, who described handling the plates as displayed by Smith. Statements signed by them have been published in most editions of the Book of Mormon. In addition to Smith and these eleven, several others described encountering the plates by holding or moving them wrapped in cloth, although without seeing the plates themselves. Their accounts of the plates&#x27; appearance tend to describe a golden-colored compilation of thin metal sheets (the &quot;plates&quot;) bound together by wires in the shape of a book.

The manuscript was completed in June 1829. E. B. Grandin published the Book of Mormon in Palmyra, New York, and it went on sale in his bookstore on March 26, 1830. Smith said he returned the plates to Moroni upon the publication of the book.

=== Views on composition ===
Multiple theories of naturalistic composition have been proposed. In the twenty-first century, leading naturalistic interpretations of Book of Mormon origins hold that Smith authored it himself, whether consciously or subconsciously, and simultaneously sincerely believed the Book of Mormon was an authentic sacred history.

Most adherents of the Latter Day Saint movement consider the Book of Mormon an authentic historical record, translated by Smith from actual ancient plates through divine revelation. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the largest Latter Day Saint denomination, maintains this as its official position.

==== Methods ====
The Book of Mormon as a written text is the transcription of what scholars Grant Hardy and William L. Davis call an &quot;extended oral performance&quot;, one which Davis considers &quot;comparable in length and magnitude to the classic oral epics, such as Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;&quot;. Eyewitnesses said Smith never referred to notes or other documents while dictating, and Smith&#x27;s followers and those close to him insisted he lacked the writing and narrative skills necessary to consciously produce a text like the Book of Mormon. Some naturalistic interpretations have therefore compared Smith&#x27;s dictation to automatic writing arising from the subconscious. However, Ann Taves considers this description problematic for overemphasizing &quot;lack of control&quot; when historical and comparative study instead suggests Smith &quot;had a highly focused awareness&quot; and &quot;a considerable degree of control over the experience&quot; of dictation.

Independent scholar William L. Davis posits that after believing he had encountered an angel in 1823, Smith &quot;carefully developed his ideas about the narratives&quot; of the Book of Mormon for several years by making outlines, whether mental or on private notes, until he began dictating in 1828. Smith&#x27;s oral recitations about Nephites to his family could have been an opportunity to work out ideas and practice oratory, and he received some formal education as a lay Methodist exhorter. In this interpretation, Smith believed the dictation he produced reflected an ancient history, but he assembled the narrative in his own words.

==== Inspirations ====
Early observers, presuming Smith incapable of writing something as long or as complex as the Book of Mormon, often searched for a possible source he might have plagiarized. In the nineteenth century, a popular hypothesis was that Smith collaborated with Sidney Rigdon to plagiarize an unpublished manuscript written by Solomon Spalding and turn into the Book of Mormon. Historians have considered the Spalding manuscript source hypothesis debunked since 1945, when Fawn M. Brodie thoroughly disproved it in her critical biography of Smith.

Historians since the early twentieth century have suggested Smith was inspired by &quot;View of the Hebrews&quot;, an 1823 book which propounded the Hebraic Indian theory, since both associate American Indians with ancient Israel and describe clashes between two dualistically opposed civilizations (&quot;View&quot; as speculation about American Indian history and the Book of Mormon as its narrative). Whether or not &quot;View&quot; influenced the Book of Mormon is the subject of debate. A pseudo-anthropological treatise, &quot;View&quot; presented allegedly empirical evidence in support of its hypothesis. The Book of Mormon is written as a narrative, and Christian themes predominate rather than supposedly Indigenous parallels. Additionally, while &quot;View&quot; supposes that Indigenous American peoples descended from the Ten Lost Tribes, the Book of Mormon actively rejects the hypothesis; the peoples in its narrative have an &quot;ancient Hebrew&quot; origin but do not descend from the lost tribes. The book ultimately heavily revises, rather than borrows, the Hebraic Indian theory.

The Book of Mormon may creatively reconfigure, without plagiarizing, parts of the popular 1678 Christian allegory &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; written by John Bunyan&quot;.&quot; For example, the martyr narrative of Abinadi in the Book of Mormon shares a complex matrix of descriptive language with Faithful&#x27;s martyr narrative in &quot;Progress&quot;. Some other Book of Mormon narratives, such as the dream Lehi has in the book&#x27;s opening, also resemble creative reworkings of &quot;Progress&quot; story arcs as well as elements of other works by Bunyan, such as &quot;The Holy War&quot; and &quot;Grace Abounding&quot;.

Historical scholarship also suggests it is plausible for Smith to have produced the Book of Mormon himself, based on his knowledge of the Bible and enabled by a democratizing religious culture.

==Content==
===Presentation===
The style of the Book of Mormon&#x27;s English text resembles that of the King James Version of the Bible. Novelist Jane Barnes considered the book &quot;difficult to read&quot;, and according to religious studies scholar Grant Hardy, the language is an &quot;awkward, repetitious form of English&quot; with a &quot;nonmainstream literary aesthetic&quot;. Narratively and structurally, the book is complex, with multiple arcs that diverge and converge in the story while contributing to the book&#x27;s overarching plot and themes. Historian Daniel Walker Howe concluded in his own appraisal that the Book of Mormon &quot;is a powerful epic written on a grand scale&quot; and &quot;should rank among the great achievements of American literature&quot;.

The Book of Mormon presents its text through multiple narrators explicitly identified as figures within the book&#x27;s own narrative. Narrators describe reading, redacting, writing, and exchanging records. The book also embeds sermons, given by figures from the narrative, throughout the text, and these internal orations make up just over 40 percent of the Book of Mormon. Periodically, the book&#x27;s primary narrators reflexively describe themselves creating the book in a move that is &quot;almost postmodern&quot; in its self-consciousness. Historian Laurie Maffly-Kipp explains that &quot;the mechanics of editing and transmitting thereby become an important feature of the text&quot;. Barnes calls the Book of Mormon a &quot;scripture about writing and its influence in a post-modern world of texts&quot; and &quot;a statement about different voices, and possibly the problem of voice, in sacred literature&quot;.

===Organization===
The Book of Mormon is organized as a compilation of smaller books, each named after its main named narrator or a prominent leader, beginning with the First Book of Nephi (1 Nephi) and ending with the Book of Moroni.

The book&#x27;s sequence is primarily chronological based on the narrative content of the book. Exceptions include the Words of Mormon and the Book of Ether. The Words of Mormon contains editorial commentary by Mormon. The Book of Ether is presented as the narrative of an earlier group of people who had come to the American continent before the immigration described in 1 Nephi. First Nephi through Omni are written in first-person narrative, as are Mormon and Moroni. The remainder of the Book of Mormon is written in third-person historical narrative, said to be compiled and abridged by Mormon (with Moroni abridging the Book of Ether and writing the latter part of Mormon and the Book of Moroni).

Most modern editions of the book have been divided into chapters and verses. Most editions of the book also contain supplementary material, including the &quot;Testimony of Three Witnesses&quot; and the &quot;Testimony of Eight Witnesses&quot; which appeared in the original 1830 edition and every official Latter-day Saint edition thereafter.

===Narrative===
The books from First Nephi to Omni are described as being from &quot;the small plates of Nephi&quot;. This account begins in ancient Jerusalem around 600 BC, telling the story of a man named Lehi, his family, and several others as they are led by God from Jerusalem shortly before the fall of that city to the Babylonians. The book describes their journey across the Arabian peninsula, and then to a &quot;promised land&quot;, presumably an unspecified location in the Americas, by ship. These books recount the group&#x27;s dealings from approximately 600 BC to about 130 BC, during which time the community grows and splits into two main groups, called Nephites and Lamanites, that frequently war with each other throughout the rest of the narrative.

Following this section is the Words of Mormon, a small book that introduces Mormon, the principal narrator for the remainder of the text. The narration describes the proceeding content (Book of Mosiah through to chapter 7 of the internal Book of Mormon) as being Mormon&#x27;s abridgment of &quot;the large plates of Nephi&quot;, existing records that detailed the people&#x27;s history up to Mormon&#x27;s own life. Part of this portion is the Book of Third Nephi, which describes a visit by Jesus to the people of the Book of Mormon sometime after his resurrection and ascension; historian John Turner calls this episode &quot;the climax of the entire scripture&quot;. After this visit, the Nephites and Lamanites unite in a harmonious, peaceful society which endures for several generations before breaking into warring factions again, and in this conflict the Nephites are destroyed while the Lamanites emerge victorious. In the narrative, Mormon, a Nephite, lives during this period of war, and he dies before finishing his book. His son Moroni takes over as narrator, describing himself taking his father&#x27;s record into his charge and finishing its writing.

Before the very end of the book, Moroni describes making an abridgment (called the Book of Ether) of a record from a much earlier people. There is a subsequent subplot describing a group of families who God leads away from the Tower of Babel after it falls. Led by a man named Jared and his brother, described as a prophet of God, these Jaredites travel to the &quot;promised land&quot; and establish a society there. After successive violent reversals between rival monarchs and faction, their society collapses around the time that Lehi&#x27;s family arrive in the promised land further south.

The narrative returns to Moroni&#x27;s present (Book of Moroni) in which he transcribes a few short documents, meditates on and addresses the book&#x27;s audience, finishes the record, and buries the plates upon which they are narrated to be inscribed upon, before implicitly dying as his father did, in what allegedly would have been the early 400s AD.

=== Teachings ===

====Jesus====

On its title page, the Book of Mormon describes its central purpose as being the &quot;convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God, manifesting himself unto all nations.&quot; Although much of the Book of Mormon&#x27;s internal chronology takes place prior to the birth of Jesus, prophets in the book frequently see him in vision and preach about him, and the people in the narrative worship Jesus as &quot;pre-Christian Christians.&quot; For example, the book&#x27;s first narrator Nephi describes having a vision of the birth, ministry, and death of Jesus, said to have taken place nearly 600 years prior to Jesus&#x27; birth. Late in the book, a narrator refers to converted peoples as &quot;children of Christ&quot;. By depicting ancient prophets and peoples as familiar with Jesus as a Savior, the Book of Mormon universalizes Christian salvation as being accessible across all time and places. By implying that even more ancient peoples were familiar with Jesus Christ, the book presents a &quot;polygenist Christian history&quot; in which Christianity has multiple origins.

In the climax of the book, Jesus visits some early inhabitants of the Americas after his resurrection in an extended bodily theophany. During this ministry, he reiterates many teachings from the New Testament, re-emphasizes salvific baptism, and introduces the ritual consumption of bread and wine &quot;in remembrance of [his] body&quot;, a teaching that became the basis for modern Latter-day Saints&#x27; &quot;memorialist&quot; view of their sacrament ordinance (analogous to communion). Jesus&#x27;s ministry in the Book of Mormon resembles his portrayal in the Gospel of John, as Jesus similarly teaches without parables and preaches faith and obedience as a central message.

Barnes argues that the Book of Mormon depicts Jesus as a &quot;revolutionary new character&quot; different from that of the New Testament in a portrayal that is &quot;constantly, subtly revising the Christian tradition&quot;. According to historian John Turner, the Book of Mormon&#x27;s depiction provides &quot;a twist&quot; on Christian trinitarianism, as Jesus in the Book of Mormon is distinct from God the Father—as he prays to God during a post-resurrection visit with the Nephites—while also emphasizing that Jesus and God have &quot;divine unity,&quot; with other parts of the book calling Jesus &quot;the Father and the Son&quot;. Beliefs among the churches of the Latter Day Saint movement range between social trinitarianism (such as among Latter-day Saints) and traditional trinitarianism (such as in Community of Christ).

==== Plan of salvation ====

The Christian concept of God&#x27;s plan of salvation for humanity is a frequently recurring theme of the Book of Mormon. While the Bible does not directly outline a plan of salvation, the Book of Mormon explicitly refers to the concept thirty times, using a variety of terms such as &quot;plan of salvation&quot;, &quot;plan of happiness&quot;, and &quot;plan of redemption&quot;. The Book of Mormon&#x27;s plan of salvation doctrine describes life as a probationary time for people to learn the gospel of Christ through revelation given to prophets and have the opportunity to choose whether or not to obey God. Jesus&#x27; atonement then makes repentance possible, enabling the righteous to enter a heavenly state after a final judgment.

Although most of Christianity traditionally considers the fall of man a negative development for humanity, the Book of Mormon instead portrays the fall as a foreordained step in God&#x27;s plan of salvation, necessary to securing human agency, eventual righteousness, and bodily joy through physical experience. This positive interpretation of the Adam and Eve story contributes to the Book of Mormon&#x27;s emphasis &quot;on the importance of human freedom and responsibility&quot; to choose salvation.

==== Dialogic revelation ====

In the Book of Mormon, revelation from God typically manifests as a dialogue between God and persons, characterizing deity as an anthropomorphic being who hears prayers and provides direct answers to questions. Multiple narratives in the book portray revelation as a dialogue in which petitioners and deity engage one another in a mutual exchange in which God&#x27;s contributions originate from outside the mortal recipient. The Book of Mormon also emphasizes regular prayer as a significant component of devotional life, depicting it as a central means through which such dialogic revelation can take place. While the Old Testament of the Christian Bible links revelation specifically to prophetic authority, the Book of Mormon&#x27;s portrayal democratizes the idea of revelation, depicting it as the right of every person. Figures such as Nephi and Ammon receive visions and revelatory direction prior to or without ever becoming prophets, and Laman and Lemuel are rebuked for hesitating to pray for revelation. Also in contrast with traditional Christian conceptions of revelations is the Book of Mormon&#x27;s broader range of revelatory content. In the Book of Mormon, figures petition God for revelatory answers to doctrinal questions and ecclesiastical crises as well as for inspiration to guide hunts, military campaigns, and sociopolitical decisions. The Book of Mormon depicts revelation as an active and sometimes laborious experience. For example, the Book of Mormon&#x27;s Brother of Jared learns to act not merely as a petitioner with questions but moreover as an interlocutor with &quot;a specific proposal&quot; for God to consider as part of a guided process of miraculous assistance.

==== Apocalyptic reversal and Indigenous or nonwhite liberation ====
The Book of Mormon&#x27;s &quot;eschatological content&quot; lends to a &quot;theology of Native and/or nonwhite liberation&quot;, in the words of American studies scholar Jared Hickman. The Book of Mormon&#x27;s narrative content includes prophecies describing how although Gentiles (generally interpreted as being whites of European descent) would conquer the Indigenous residents of the Americas (imagined in the Book of Mormon as being a remnant of descendants of the Lamanites), this conquest would only precede the Native Americans&#x27; revival and resurgence as a God-empowered people. The Book of Mormon narrative&#x27;s prophecies envision a Christian eschaton in which Indigenous people are destined to rise up as the true leaders of the continent, manifesting in a new utopia to be called &quot;Zion&quot;. White Gentiles would have an opportunity to repent of their sins and join themselves to the Indigenous remnant, but if white Gentile society fails to do so, the Book of Mormon&#x27;s content foretells a future &quot;apocalyptic reversal&quot; in which Native Americans will destroy white American society and replace it with a godly, Zionic society. This prophecy commanding whites to repent and become supporters of American Indians even bears &quot;special authority as an utterance of Jesus&quot; Christ himself during a messianic appearance at the book&#x27;s climax.

Furthermore, the Book of Mormon&#x27;s &quot;formal logic&quot; criticizes the theological supports for racism and white supremacy prevalent in the antebellum United States by enacting a textual apocalypse. The book&#x27;s apparently white Nephite narrators fail to recognize and repent of their own sinful, hubristic prejudices against the seemingly darker-skinned Lamanites in the narrative. In their pride, the Nephites repeatedly backslide into producing oppressive social orders, such that the book&#x27;s narrative performs a sustained critique of colonialist racism. The book concludes with its own narrative implosion in which Lamanites suddenly succeed over and destroy Nephites in a literary turn seemingly designed to jar the average antebellum white American reader into recognizing the &quot;utter inadequacy of his or her rac(ial)ist common sense&quot;.

==Religious significance==

=== Early Mormonism ===

Adherents of the early Latter Day Saint movement frequently read the Book of Mormon as a corroboration of and supplement to the Bible, persuaded by its resemblance to the King James Version&#x27;s form and language. For these early readers, the Book of Mormon confirmed the Bible&#x27;s scriptural veracity and resolved then-contemporary theological controversies the Bible did not seem to adequately address, such as the appropriate mode of baptism, the role of prayer, and the nature of the Christian atonement. Early church administrative design also drew inspiration from the Book of Mormon. Oliver Cowdery and Joseph Smith, respectively, used the depiction of the Christian church in the Book of Mormon as a template for their &quot;Articles of the Church&quot; and &quot;Articles and Covenants of the Church&quot;.

The Book of Mormon was also significant in the early movement as a sign, proving Joseph Smith&#x27;s claimed prophetic calling, signalling the &quot;restoration of all things&quot;, and ending what was believed to have been an apostasy from true Christianity. Early Latter Day Saints tended to interpret the Book of Mormon through a millenarian lens and consequently believed the book portended Christ&#x27;s imminent Second Coming. And during the movement&#x27;s first years, observers identified converts with the new scripture they propounded, nicknaming them &quot;Mormons&quot;.

Early Mormons also cultivated their own individual relationships with the Book of Mormon. Reading the book became an ordinary habit for some, and some would reference passages by page number in correspondence with friends and family. Historian Janiece Johnson explains that early converts&#x27; &quot;depth of Book of Mormon usage is illustrated most thoroughly through intertextuality—the pervasive echoes, allusions, and expansions on the Book of Mormon text that appear in the early converts&#x27; own writings.&quot; Early Latter Day Saints alluded to Book of Mormon narratives, incorporated Book of Mormon turns of phrase into their writing styles, and even gave their children Book of Mormon names.

==== Joseph Smith ====
Like many other early adherents of the Latter Day Saint movement, Smith referenced Book of Mormon scriptures in his preaching relatively infrequently and cited the Bible more often. In 1832, Smith dictated a revelation that condemned the &quot;whole church&quot; for treating the Book of Mormon lightly, although even after doing so Smith still referenced the Book of Mormon less often than the Bible. Nevertheless, in 1841 Joseph Smith characterized the Book of Mormon as &quot;the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of [the] religion&quot;. Although Smith quoted the book infrequently, he accepted the Book of Mormon narrative world as his own.

=== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ===
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) accepts the Book of Mormon as one of the four sacred texts in its scriptural canon called the &quot;standard works&quot;. Church leaders and publications have &quot;strongly affirm[ed]&quot; Smith&#x27;s claims of the book&#x27;s significance to the faith. According to the church&#x27;s &quot;Articles of Faith&quot;—a document written by Joseph Smith in 1842 and canonized by the church as scripture in 1880—members &quot;believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly,&quot; and they &quot;believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God,&quot; without qualification. In their evangelism, Latter-day Saint leaders and missionaries have long emphasized the book&#x27;s place in a causal chain which held that if the Book of Mormon was &quot;verifiably true revelation of God,&quot; then it justified Smith&#x27;s claims to prophetic authority to restore the New Testament church.

Latter-day Saints have also long believed the Book of Mormon&#x27;s contents confirm and fulfill biblical prophecies. For example, &quot;many Latter-day Saints&quot; consider the biblical patriarch Jacob&#x27;s description of his son Joseph as &quot;a fruitful bough... whose branches run over a wall&quot; a prophecy of Lehi&#x27;s posterity—described as descendants of Joseph—overflowing into the New World. Latter-day Saints also believe the Bible prophesies of the Book of Mormon as an additional testament to God&#x27;s dealings with humanity.

In the 1980s, the church placed greater emphasis on the Book of Mormon as a central text of the faith. In 1982, it added the subtitle &quot;Another Testament of Jesus Christ&quot; to its official editions of the Book of Mormon. Ezra Taft Benson, the church&#x27;s thirteenth president (1985–1994), especially emphasized the Book of Mormon. Referencing Smith&#x27;s 1832 revelation, Benson said the church remained under condemnation for treating the Book of Mormon lightly.

Since the late 1980s, Latter-day Saint leaders have encouraged church members to read from the Book of Mormon daily, and in the twenty-first century, many Latter-day Saints use the book in private devotions and family worship. Literary scholar Terryl Givens observes that for Latter-day Saints, the Book of Mormon is &quot;the principal scriptural focus&quot;, a &quot;cultural touchstone, and &quot;absolutely central&quot; to worship, including in weekly services, Sunday School, youth seminaries, and more.

Approximately 90 to 95% of all Book of Mormon printings have been affiliated with the church. As of October 2020, it has published more than 192 million copies of the Book of Mormon.
===Community of Christ===
The Community of Christ (formerly the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints or RLDS Church) views the Book of Mormon as scripture which provides an additional witness of Jesus Christ in support of the Bible. The Community of Christ publishes two versions of the book. The first is the Authorized Edition, first published by the then-RLDS Church in 1908, whose text is based on comparing the original printer&#x27;s manuscript and the 1837 Second Edition (or &quot;Kirtland Edition&quot;) of the Book of Mormon. Its content is similar to the Latter-day Saint edition of the Book of Mormon, but the versification is different. The Community of Christ also publishes a &quot;New Authorized Version&quot; (also called a &quot;reader&#x27;s edition&quot;), first released in 1966, which attempts to modernize the language of the text by removing archaisms and standardizing punctuation.

Use of the Book of Mormon varies among Community of Christ membership. The church describes it as scripture and includes references to the Book of Mormon in its official lectionary. In 2010, representatives told the National Council of Churches that &quot;the Book of Mormon is in our DNA&quot;. The book remains a symbol of the denomination&#x27;s belief in continuing revelation from God. Nevertheless, its usage in North American congregations declined between the mid-twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Community of Christ theologian Anthony Chvala-Smith describes the Book of Mormon as being akin to a &quot;subordinate standard&quot; relative to the Bible, giving the Bible priority over the Book of Mormon, and the denomination does not emphasize the book as part of its self-conceived identity. Book of Mormon use varies in what David Howlett calls &quot;Mormon heritage regions&quot;: North America, Western Europe, and French Polynesia. Outside these regions, where there are tens of thousands of members, congregations almost never use the Book of Mormon in their worship, and they may be entirely unfamiliar with it. Some in Community of Christ remain interested in prioritizing the Book of Mormon in religious practice and have variously responded to these developments by leaving the denomination or by striving to re-emphasize the book.

During this time, the Community of Christ moved away from emphasizing the Book of Mormon as an authentic record of a historical past. By the late-twentieth century, church president W. Grant McMurray made open the possibility the book was nonhistorical. McMurray reiterated this ambivalence in 2001, reflecting, &quot;The proper use of the Book of Mormon as sacred scripture has been under wide discussion in the 1970s and beyond, in part because of long-standing questions about its historical authenticity and in part because of perceived theological inadequacies, including matters of race and ethnicity.&quot; When a resolution was submitted at the 2007 Community of Christ World Conference to &quot;reaffirm the Book of Mormon as a divinely inspired record&quot;, church president Stephen M. Veazey ruled it out-of-order. He stated, &quot;while the Church affirms the Book of Mormon as scripture, and makes it available for study and use in various languages, we do not attempt to mandate the degree of belief or use. This position is in keeping with our longstanding tradition that belief in the Book of Mormon is not to be used as a test of fellowship or membership in the church.&quot;

=== Greater Latter Day Saint movement ===
Since the death of Joseph Smith in 1844, there have been approximately seventy different churches that have been part of the Latter Day Saint movement, fifty of which were extant as of 2012. Religious studies scholar Paul Gutjahr explains that &quot;each of these sects developed its own special relationship with the Book of Mormon&quot;. For example James Strang, who led a denomination in the nineteenth century, reenacted Smith&#x27;s production of the Book of Mormon by claiming in the 1840s and 1850s to receive and translate new scriptures engraved on metal plates, which became the Voree Plates and the Book of the Law of the Lord.

William Bickerton led another denomination, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (today called The Church of Jesus Christ), which accepted the Book of Mormon as scripture alongside the Bible although it did not canonize other Latter Day Saint religious texts like the Doctrine and Covenants and Pearl of Great Price. The contemporary Church of Jesus Christ continues to consider the &quot;Bible and Book of Mormon together&quot; to be &quot;the foundation of [their] faith and the building blocks of&quot; their church.

Nahua-Mexican Latter-day Saint Margarito Bautista believed the Book of Mormon told an Indigenous history of Mexico before European contact, and he identified himself as a &quot;descendant of Father Lehi&quot;, a prophet in the Book of Mormon. Bautista believed the Book of Mormon revealed that Indigenous Mexicans were a chosen remnant of biblical Israel and therefore had a sacred destiny to someday lead the church spiritually and the world politically. To promote this belief, he wrote a theological treatise synthesizing Mexican nationalism and Book of Mormon content, published in 1935. Anglo-American LDS Church leadership suppressed the book and eventually excommunicated Bautista, and he went on to found a new Mormon denomination. Officially named &quot;El Reino de Dios en su Plenitud&quot;, the denomination continues to exist in Colonial Industrial, Ozumba, Mexico as a church with several hundred members who call themselves &quot;Mormons&quot;.

Separate editions of the Book of Mormon have been published by a number of churches in the Latter Day Saint movement, along with private individuals and organizations not endorsed by any specific denomination.

==Historicity==

===Mainstream views===
Mainstream archaeological, historical, and scientific communities do not consider the Book of Mormon an ancient record of actual historical events. Principally, the content of the Book of Mormon does not correlate with archaeological, genetic, or linguistic evidence about the past of the Americas or ancient Near East.

====Archaeology====
There is no accepted correlation between locations described in the Book of Mormon and known American archaeological sites. Additionally, the Book of Mormon&#x27;s narrative refers to the presence of animals, plants, metals, and technologies of which archaeological and scientific studies have found little or no evidence in post-Pleistocene, pre-Columbian America. Such anachronistic references include crops such as barley, wheat, and silk; livestock like cattle, donkeys, horses, oxen, and sheep; and metals and technology such as brass, steel, the wheel, and chariots.

Mesoamerica is the preferred setting for the Book of Mormon among many apologists who advocate a limited geography model of Book of Mormon events. However, there is no evidence accepted by non-Mormons in Mesoamerican societies of cultural influence from anything described in the Book of Mormon.

====Genetics====

Until the late-twentieth century, most adherents of the Latter Day Saint movement who affirmed Book of Mormon historicity believed the people described in the Book of Mormon text were the exclusive ancestors of all Indigenous peoples in the Americas. DNA evidence proved that to be impossible, as no DNA evidence links any Native American group to ancestry from the ancient Near East as a belief in Book of Mormon peoples as the exclusive ancestors of Indigenous Americans would require. Instead, detailed genetic research indicates that Indigenous Americans&#x27; ancestry traces back to Asia, and reveals numerous details about the movements and settlements of ancient Americans which are either lacking in, or contradicted by, the Book of Mormon narrative.

====Linguistics and intertextuality====
There are no widely accepted linguistic connections between any Native American languages and Near Eastern languages, and &quot;the diversity of Native American languages could not have developed from a single origin in the time frame&quot; that would be necessary to validate a hemispheric view of Book of Mormon historicity. The Book of Mormon states it was written in a language called &quot;Reformed Egyptian&quot;, clashing with Book of Mormon peoples&#x27; purported origin as the descendants of a family from the Kingdom of Judah, where inhabitants would have communicated in Aramaic, not Egyptian. There are no known examples of &quot;Reformed Egyptian&quot;.

The Book of Mormon also includes excerpts from and demonstrates intertextuality with portions of the biblical Book of Isaiah whose widely accepted periods of creation postdate the alleged departure of Lehi&#x27;s family from Jerusalem circa 600 BCE. No Latter-day Saint arguments for a unified Isaiah or criticisms of the Deutero-Isaiah and Trito-Isaiah understandings have matched the extent of scholarship supporting later datings for authorship.

===Latter Day Saint views===
Most adherents of the Latter Day Saint movement consider the Book of Mormon to be historically authentic and to describe events that genuinely took place in the ancient Americas. Within the Latter Day Saint movement there are several individuals and apologetic organizations, most of whom are or which are composed of lay Latter-day Saints, that seek to answer challenges to or advocate for Book of Mormon historicity. For example, in response to linguistics and genetics rendering long-popular hemispheric models of Book of Mormon geography impossible, many apologists posit Book of Mormon peoples could have dwelled in a limited geographical region while Indigenous peoples of other descents occupied the rest of the Americas. To account for anachronisms, apologists often suggest Smith&#x27;s translation assigned familiar terms to unfamiliar ideas. In the context of a miraculously translated Book of Mormon, supporters affirm that anachronistic intertextuality may also have miraculous explanations.

Some apologists strive to identify parallels between the Book of Mormon and biblical antiquity, such as the presence of several complex chiasmi resembling a literary form used in ancient Hebrew poetry and in the Old Testament. Others attempt to identify parallels between Mesoamerican archaeological sites and locations described in the Book of Mormon, such as John L. Sorenson, according to whom the Santa Rosa archaeological site resembles the city of Zarahemla in the Book of Mormon. When mainstream, non-Mormon scholars examine alleged parallels between the Book of Mormon and the ancient world, however, scholars typically deem them &quot;chance based upon only superficial similarities&quot; or &quot;parallelomania&quot;, the result of having predetermined ideas about the subject.

Despite the popularity and influence among Latter-day Saints of literature propounding Book of Mormon historicity, not all Mormons who affirm Book of Mormon historicity are universally persuaded by apologetic work. Some claim historicity more modestly, such as Richard Bushman&#x27;s statement that &quot;I read the Book of Mormon as informed Christians read the Bible. As I read, I know the arguments against the book&#x27;s historicity, but I can&#x27;t help feeling that the words are true and the events happened. I believe it in the face of many questions.&quot;

Some denominations and adherents of the Latter Day Saint movement consider the Book of Mormon a work of inspired fiction akin to pseudepigrapha or biblical midrash that constitutes scripture by revealing true doctrine about God, similar to a common interpretation of the biblical Book of Job. Many in Community of Christ hold this view, and the leadership takes no official position on Book of Mormon historicity; among lay members, views vary. Some Latter-day Saints consider the Book of Mormon fictional, although this view is marginal in the denomination at large.

==== Beliefs about geographical setting ====

Related to the work&#x27;s historicity is consideration of where its events are claimed to have occurred if historical. The LDS Church—the largest denomination in the Latter Day Saint movement—affirms the book as literally historical but does not make a formal claim of where precisely its events took place. Throughout much of the 19th and 20th centuries, Joseph Smith and others in the Latter Day Saint movement claimed that the book&#x27;s events occurred broadly throughout North and South America. During the twentieth century, Latter-day Saint apologists backed away from this hemispheric belief in favor of believing the book&#x27;s events took place in a more limited geographic setting within the Americas. This limited geography model gained broader currency in the LDS Church in the 1990s, and in the twenty-first century it is the most popular belief about Book of Mormon geography among those who believe it is historical. In 2006, the LDS Church revised its introduction to LDS editions of the Book of Mormon, which previously read that Lamanites were &quot;the principal ancestors of the American Indians&quot;, to read that they are &quot;among the ancestors of the American Indians&quot;. A movement among Latter-day Saints called Heartlanders believes that the Book of Mormon took place specifically within what is presently the United States.

==Historical context==

=== American Indian origins ===

Contact with the Indigenous peoples of the Americas prompted intellectual and theological controversy among many Europeans and European Americans who wondered how biblical narratives of world history could account for hitherto unrecognized Indigenous societies. From the seventeenth century through the early nineteenth, numerous European and American writers proposed that ancient Jews, perhaps through the Lost Ten Tribes, were the ancestors of Native Americans. One of the first books to suggest that Native Americans descended from Jews was written by Jewish-Dutch rabbi and scholar Manasseh ben Israel in 1650. Such curiosity and speculation about Indigenous origins persisted in the United States into the antebellum period when the Book of Mormon was published, as archaeologist Stephen Williams explains that &quot;relating the American Indians to the Lost Tribes of Israel was supported by many&quot; at the time of the book&#x27;s production and publication. Although the Book of Mormon did not explicitly identify Native Americans as descendants of the diasporic Israelites in its narrative, nineteenth-century readers consistently drew that conclusion and considered the book theological support for believing American Indians were of Israelite descent.

European descended settlers took note of earthworks left behind by the Mound Builder cultures and had some difficulty believing that Native Americans, denigrated in racist colonial worldviews and whose numbers had been greatly reduced over the previous centuries, could have produced them. A common theory was that a more &quot;civilized&quot; and &quot;advanced&quot; people had built them, but were overrun and destroyed by a more savage, numerous group. Some Book of Mormon content resembles this &quot;mound-builder&quot; genre pervasive in the nineteenth century. Historian Curtis Dahl wrote, &quot;Undoubtedly the most famous and certainly the most influential of all Mound-Builder literature is the &quot;Book of Mormon&quot; (1830). Whether one wishes to accept it as divinely inspired or the work of Joseph Smith, it fits exactly into the tradition.&quot; Historian Richard Bushman argues the Book of Mormon does not comfortably fit the Mound Builder genre because contemporaneous writings that speculated about Native origins &quot;were explicit about recognizable Indian practices&quot; whereas the &quot;Book of Mormon deposited its people on some unknown shore—not even definitely identified as America—and had them live out their history&quot; without including tropes that Euro-Americans stereotyped as Indigenous.

=== Critique of the United States ===

The Book of Mormon can be read as a critique of the United States during Smith&#x27;s lifetime. Historian of religion Nathan O. Hatch called the Book of Mormon &quot;a document of profound social protest&quot;, and historian Bushman &quot;found the book thundering no to the state of the world in Joseph Smith&#x27;s time.&quot; In the Jacksonian era of antebellum America, class inequality was a major concern as fiscal downturns and the economy&#x27;s transition from guild-based artisanship to private business sharpened economic inequality, and poll taxes in New York limited access to the vote, and the culture of civil discourse and mores surrounding liberty allowed social elites to ignore and delegitimize populist participation in public discourse. Against the backdrop of these trends, the Book of Mormon condemned upper class wealth as elitist, and it criticized social norms around public discourse that silenced critique of the country.

==Manuscripts==
Joseph Smith dictated the Book of Mormon to several scribes over a period of 13 months, resulting in three manuscripts. Upon examination of pertinent historical records, the book appears to have been dictated over the course of 57 to 63 days within the 13-month period.

The 116 lost pages contained the first portion of the Book of Lehi; it was lost after Smith loaned the original, uncopied manuscript to Martin Harris.

The first completed manuscript, called the original manuscript, was completed using a variety of scribes. Portions of the original manuscript were also used for typesetting. In October 1841, the entire original manuscript was placed into the cornerstone of the Nauvoo House, and sealed up until nearly forty years later when the cornerstone was reopened. It was then discovered that much of the original manuscript had been destroyed by water seepage and mold. Surviving manuscript pages were handed out to various families and individuals in the 1880s.

Only 28 percent of the original manuscript now survives, including a remarkable find of fragments from 58 pages in 1991. The majority of what remains of the original manuscript is now kept in the LDS Church&#x27;s archives.

The second completed manuscript, called the printer&#x27;s manuscript, was a copy of the original manuscript produced by Oliver Cowdery and two other scribes. It is at this point that initial copyediting of the Book of Mormon was completed. Observations of the original manuscript show little evidence of corrections to the text. Shortly before his death in 1850, Cowdery gave the printer&#x27;s manuscript to David Whitmer, another of the Three Witnesses. In 1903, the manuscript was bought from Whitmer&#x27;s grandson by the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, now known as the Community of Christ. On September 20, 2017, the LDS Church purchased the manuscript from the Community of Christ at a reported price of $35million. The printer&#x27;s manuscript is now the earliest surviving complete copy of the Book of Mormon. The manuscript was imaged in 1923 and has been made available for viewing online.

Critical comparisons between surviving portions of the manuscripts show an average of two to three changes per page from the original manuscript to the printer&#x27;s manuscript. The printer&#x27;s manuscript was further edited, adding paragraphing and punctuation to the first third of the text.

The printer&#x27;s manuscript was not used fully in the typesetting of the 1830 version of Book of Mormon; portions of the original manuscript were also used for typesetting. The original manuscript was used by Smith to further correct errors printed in the 1830 and 1837 versions of the Book of Mormon for the 1840 printing of the book.

===Printer&#x27;s manuscript ownership history===
In the late-19th century the extant portion of the printer&#x27;s manuscript remained with the family of David Whitmer, who had been a principal founder of the Latter Day Saints and who, by the 1870s, led the Church of Christ (Whitmerite). During the 1870s, according to the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, the LDS Church unsuccessfully attempted to buy it from Whitmer for a record price. Church president Joseph F. Smith refuted this assertion in a 1901 letter, believing such a manuscript &quot;possesses no value whatever.&quot; In 1895, Whitmer&#x27;s grandson George Schweich inherited the manuscript. By 1903, Schweich had mortgaged the manuscript for $1,800 and, needing to raise at least that sum, sold a collection including 72 percent of the book of the original printer&#x27;s manuscript (John Whitmer&#x27;s manuscript history, parts of Joseph Smith&#x27;s translation of the Bible, manuscript copies of several revelations, and a piece of paper containing copied Book of Mormon characters) to the RLDS Church (now the Community of Christ) for $2,450, with $2,300 of this amount for the printer&#x27;s manuscript.

In 2015, this remaining portion was published by the Church Historian&#x27;s Press in its &quot;Joseph Smith Papers&quot; series, in Volume Three of &quot;Revelations and Translations&quot;; and, in 2017, the church bought the printer&#x27;s manuscript for .

==Editions==

=== Chapter and verse notation systems ===
The original 1830 publication had no verses (breaking the text into paragraphs instead). The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&#x27; (LDS Church) 1852 edition numbered the paragraphs. Orson Pratt, an apostle of the denomination, divided the text into shorter chapters, organized it into verses, and added paratextual footnotes. In 1920, the LDS Church published a new edition edited by apostle James E. Talmage, who reformatted the text into double columns, imitating the prevailing format of Bibles in the United States. The next new Latter-day saint edition of the book was published in 1981; this edition added new chapter summaries and cross references.

The Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church; later renamed to Community of Christ) also published editions of the Book of Mormon. It printed editions at Plano, Illinois and Lamoni, Iowa in 1874. In 1892, the church published a large-print edition that split the original edition&#x27;s paragraphs into shorter ones. From 1906 to 1908, Reversification Committee appointed by the RLDS Church revised its Book of Mormon text based on manuscript comparison and also reformatted it into shorter verses (though it retained the original chapter lengths); the RLDS Church published this version as the Revised Authorized edition, printing it beginning in April 1909.

=== Other editions ===
===Historic editions===
The following editions no longer in publication marked major developments in the text or reader&#x27;s helps printed in the Book of Mormon.
=== Non-English translations ===
The Latter-day Saints version of the Book of Mormon has been translated into 83 languages and selections have been translated into an additional 25 languages. In 2001, the LDS Church reported that all or part of the Book of Mormon was available in the native language of 99 percent of Latter-day Saints and 87 percent of the world&#x27;s total population.

Translations into languages without a tradition of writing (e.g., Kaqchikel, Tzotzil) have been published as audio recordings and as transliterations with Latin characters. Translations into American Sign Language are available as video recordings.

Typically, translators are Latter-day Saints who are employed by the church and translate the text from the original English. Each manuscript is reviewed several times before it is approved and published.

In 1998, the church stopped translating selections from the Book of Mormon and announced that instead each new translation it approves will be a full edition.

==Representations in media==

Artists have depicted Book of Mormon scenes and figures in visual art since the beginnings of the Latter Day Saint movement. The nonprofit Book of Mormon Art Catalog documents the existence of at least 2,500 visual depictions of Book of Mormon content. According to art historian Jenny Champoux, early artwork of the Book of Mormon relied on European iconography; eventually, a distinctive &quot;Latter-day Saint style&quot; developed.

Events of the Book of Mormon are the focus of several films produced by the LDS Church, including &quot;The Life of Nephi&quot; (1915), &quot;How Rare a Possession&quot; (1987) and &quot;The Testaments of One Fold and One Shepherd&quot; (2000). Depictions of Book of Mormon narratives in films not officially commissioned by the church (sometimes colloquially known as Mormon cinema) include &quot;The Book of Mormon Movie, Vol. 1: The Journey&quot; (2003) and &quot;Passage to Zarahemla&quot; (2007).

In &quot;one of the most complex uses of Mormonism in cinema,&quot; Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s film &quot;Family Plot&quot; portrays a funeral service in which a priest (apparently non-Mormon, by his appearance) reads Second Nephi 9:20–27, a passage describing Jesus Christ having victory over death.

In 2011, a long-running satirical musical titled &quot;The Book of Mormon&quot;, written by &quot;South Park&quot; creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone in collaboration with Robert Lopez, premiered on Broadway, winning nine Tony Awards, including Best Musical. Its London production won the Olivier Award for best musical. The musical is not principally about Book of Mormon content and tells an original story about Latter-day Saint missionaries in the twenty-first century.

In 2019, the church began producing a series of live-action adaptations of various stories within the Book of Mormon, titled Book of Mormon Videos, which it distributed on its website and YouTube channel.

<doc id="3979" wikidata="Q93191" url="?curid=3979" title="Baptists">
<text>Baptists are a denomination of Protestant Christianity distinguished by baptizing only professing Christian believers (believer&#x27;s baptism) and doing so by complete immersion. Baptist churches generally subscribe to the doctrines of soul competency (the responsibility and accountability of every person before God), &quot;sola fide&quot; (salvation by faith alone), &quot;sola scriptura&quot; (the Bible is the sole infallible authority, as the rule of faith and practice) and congregationalist church government. Baptists recognize generally two ordinances: baptism and communion. 

Diverse from their beginning, those identifying as Baptists today may differ widely from one another in what they believe, how they worship, their attitudes toward other Christians, and their understanding of what is important in Christian discipleship. Baptist missionaries have spread various Baptist churches to every continent. The largest group of Baptist churches is the Baptist World Alliance, and there are many different groupings of Baptist churches and Baptist congregations.

Historians trace the earliest Baptist church to 1609 in Amsterdam, with English Separatist John Smyth as its pastor. In accordance with his reading of the New Testament, he rejected baptism of infants and instituted baptism only of believing adults. Baptist practice spread to England, where the General Baptists considered Christ&#x27;s atonement to extend to all people, while the Particular Baptists believed that it extended only to the elect. Thomas Helwys formulated a distinctively Baptist request that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have freedom of religion. Helwys died in prison as a consequence of the religious conflict with English Dissenters under James I.

==Origins==
Baptist historian Bruce Gourley outlines four main views of Baptist origins:

# the modern scholarly consensus that the movement traces its origin to the 17th century via the English Separatists,
# the view that it was an outgrowth of the Anabaptist movement of believer&#x27;s baptism begun in 1525 on the European continent,
# the perpetuity view which assumes that the Baptist &quot;faith and practice&quot; has existed since the time of Christ, and
# the successionist view, which argues that Baptist &quot;churches&quot; actually existed in an unbroken chain since the time of Christ. Some people prior to the reformation acknowledge the existence of Baptists and their separation from the church. 

===English separatist view===
Modern Baptist churches trace their history to the English Separatist movement in the 17th century, over a century after the foundation of the Church of England during the Protestant Reformation. This view of Baptist origins has the most historical support and is the most widely accepted. Adherents to this position consider the influence of Anabaptists upon early Baptists to be minimal. It was a time of considerable political and religious turmoil. Both individuals and churches were willing to give up their theological roots if they became convinced that a more biblical &quot;truth&quot; had been discovered.

During the Reformation, the Church of England (Anglicans) separated from the Roman Catholic Church. There were some Christians who were not content with the achievements of the mainstream Protestant Reformation. There also were Christians who were disappointed that the Church of England had not made corrections of what some considered to be errors and abuses. Of those most critical of the church&#x27;s direction, some chose to stay and try to make constructive changes from within the Anglican Church. They became known as &quot;Puritans&quot; and are described by Gourley as cousins of the English Separatists. Others decided they must leave the established church because of their dissatisfaction and became known as the Separatists.

In 1579, Faustus Socinus founded the Unitarian Polish Brethren in Poland-Lithuania, which was a tolerant country. The Unitarians taught baptism by immersion. After their expulsion from the Commonwealth in 1658, many of them fled to the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, the Unitarians introduced immersion baptism to the Dutch Mennonites.

Baptist churches have their origins in a movement started by John Smyth and Thomas Helwys in Amsterdam. Because they shared beliefs with the Puritans and Congregationalists, they went into exile in 1607 with other believers who held the same biblical positions. They believe that the Bible is to be the only guide and that the believer&#x27;s baptism is what the scriptures require. In 1609, the year considered to be the foundation of the movement, they baptized believers and founded the first Baptist church.

In 1609, while still there, Smyth wrote a tract titled &quot;The Character of the Beast,&quot; or &quot;The False Constitution of the Church.&quot; In it he expressed two propositions: first, infants are not to be baptized; and second, &quot;Antichristians converted are to be admitted into the true Church by baptism.&quot; Hence, his conviction was that a scriptural church should consist only of regenerate believers who have been baptized on a personal confession of faith. He rejected the Separatist movement&#x27;s doctrine of infant baptism. 

Shortly thereafter, Smyth left the group. Ultimately, Smyth became committed to believers&#x27; baptism as the only biblical baptism. He was convinced on the basis of his interpretation of Scripture that infants would not be damned should they die in infancy. Smyth, convinced that his self-baptism was invalid, applied with the Mennonites for membership. He died while waiting for membership, and some of his followers became Mennonites. Helwys and others kept their baptism and their Baptist commitments. The modern Baptist denomination is an outgrowth of Smyth&#x27;s movement. Baptists rejected the name Anabaptist when they were called that by opponents in derision. McBeth writes that as late as the 18th century, many Baptists referred to themselves as &quot;the Christians commonly—though &quot;falsely&quot;—called Anabaptists.&quot;

Helwys took over the leadership, leading the church back to England in 1611, and he published the first Baptist confession of faith &quot;A Declaration of Faith of English People&quot; in 1611. He founded the first General Baptist Church in Spitalfields, east London, in 1612.

Another milestone in the early development of Baptist doctrine was in 1638 with John Spilsbury, a Calvinist minister who helped to promote the strict practice of believer&#x27;s baptism by immersion (as opposed to affusion or aspersion). According to Tom Nettles, professor of historical theology at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, &quot;Spilsbury&#x27;s cogent arguments for a gathered, disciplined congregation of believers baptized by immersion as constituting the New Testament church gave expression to and built on insights that had emerged within separatism, advanced in the life of John Smyth and the suffering congregation of Thomas Helwys, and matured in Particular Baptists.&quot;

===Anabaptist influence view===
A minority view is that early 17th century Baptists were influenced by (but not directly connected to) continental Anabaptists. According to this view, the General Baptists shared similarities with Dutch Waterlander Mennonites (one of many Anabaptist groups) including believer&#x27;s baptism only, religious liberty, separation of church and state, and Arminian views of salvation, predestination and original sin. 

It is certain that the early Baptist church led by Smyth had contacts with the Anabaptists; however it is debated if these influences found their way into the English General Baptists. Representatives of this theory include A.C. Underwood and William R. Estep. Gourley writes that among some contemporary Baptist scholars who emphasize the faith of the community over soul liberty, the Anabaptist influence theory is making a comeback. This view was also taught by the Reformed historian Philip Schaff.

However, the relations between Baptists and Anabaptists were early strained. In 1624, the five existing Baptist churches of London issued a condemnation of the Anabaptists. Furthermore, the original group associated with Smyth (popularly believed to be the first Baptists) broke with the Waterlander Mennonite Anabaptists after a brief period of association in the Netherlands.

===Perpetuity and succession view===
Traditional Baptist historians write from the perspective that Baptists had existed since the time of Christ. Proponents of the Baptist successionist or perpetuity view consider the Baptist movement to have existed independently from Roman Catholicism and prior to the Protestant Reformation. This view has been characterized as &quot;apologetic and polemical&quot; and &quot;without consideration of a critical, scientific methodology&quot;.

The perpetuity view is often identified with &quot;The Trail of Blood&quot;, a booklet of five lectures by James Milton Carroll published in 1931. Other Baptist writers who advocate the successionist theory of Baptist origins are John T. Christian and Thomas Crosby. This view was held by English Baptist preacher Charles Spurgeon as well as Jesse Mercer, the namesake of Mercer University. In 1898 William Whitsitt was pressured to resign his presidency of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary for denying Baptist successionism.

===Baptist origins in the United Kingdom===

In 1612 Helwys established a Baptist congregation in London, consisting of congregants from Smyth&#x27;s church. A number of other Baptist churches sprang up, and they became known as the General Baptists. The Particular Baptists were established when a group of Calvinist Separatists adopted believers&#x27; Baptism. The Particular Baptists consisted of seven churches by 1644 and had created a confession of faith called the First London Confession of Faith.

===Baptist origins in North America===

Both Roger Williams and John Clarke are variously credited as founding the earliest Baptist church in North America. In 1639 Williams established a Baptist church in Providence, Rhode Island, and Clarke began a Baptist church in Newport, Rhode Island. According to a Baptist historian who has researched the matter extensively, &quot;There is much debate over the centuries as to whether the Providence or Newport church deserved the place of &#x27;first&#x27; Baptist congregation in America. Exact records for both congregations are lacking.&quot;

The First Great Awakening energized the Baptist movement, and the Baptist community experienced spectacular growth. Baptists became the largest Christian community in many southern states, including among the enslaved Black population.

Baptist missionary work in Canada began in the British colony of Nova Scotia (present day Nova Scotia and New Brunswick) in the 1760s. The first official record of a Baptist church in Canada was Horton Baptist Church (now Wolfville) in Wolfville, Nova Scotia on 29 October 1778. The church was established with the assistance of the New Light evangelist Henry Alline. Many of Alline&#x27;s followers, after his death, converted and strengthened the Baptist presence in the Atlantic region. Two major groups of Baptists formed the basis of the churches in the Maritimes. These were referred to as Regular Baptist (Calvinistic in their doctrine) and Free Will Baptists (Arminian in their doctrine).

In May 1845, the Baptist congregations in the United States split over slavery and missions. The Home Mission Society prevented slaveholders from being appointed as missionaries. The split created the Southern Baptist Convention, while the northern congregations formed their own umbrella organization now called the American Baptist Churches USA (ABC-USA). In 2015, Baptists in the U.S. number 50 million people and constitute roughly one-third of American Protestants.

===Baptist origins in Ukraine===
The Baptist churches in Ukraine were preceded by the German Anabaptist and Mennonite communities, who had been living in southern Ukraine since the 16th century, and who practiced adult believer&#x27;s baptism. The first Baptist baptism (adult baptism by full immersion) in Ukraine took place in 1864 on the river Inhul in the Yelizavetgrad region (now Kropyvnytskyi region), in a German settlement. In 1867, the first Baptist communities were organized in that area. From there, the Baptist movement spread across the south of Ukraine and then to other regions as well. 

One of the first Baptist communities was registered in Kyiv in 1907, and in 1908 the First All-Russian Convention of Baptists was held there, as Ukraine was still controlled by the Russian Empire. The All-Russian Union of Baptists was established in Yekaterinoslav (now Dnipro) in southern Ukraine. At the end of the 19th century, there were between 100,000 and 300,000 Baptists in Ukraine. An independent All-Ukrainian Baptist Union of Ukraine was established during the brief period of Ukraine&#x27;s independence in early 20th-century and once again after the fall of the Soviet Union, the largest of which is currently known as the Evangelical Baptist Union of Ukraine.

==Baptist churches==

Some Baptist church congregations choose to be independent of larger church organizations (Independent Baptist). Other Baptist churches choose to be part of an international or national Baptist Christian denomination or association while still adhering to a congregationalist polity. This cooperative relationship allows the development of common organizations, for mission and societal purposes, such as humanitarian aid, schools, theological institutes and hospitals. 

The majority of Baptist churches are part of national denominations (or &#x27;associations&#x27; or &#x27;cooperative groups&#x27;), as well as the Baptist World Alliance (BWA), formed in 1905 by 24 Baptist denominations from various countries. The BWA&#x27;s goals include caring for the needy, leading in world evangelism and defending human rights and religious freedom.

==Missionary organizations==
Missionary organizations favored the development of the movement on all continents. The BMS World Mission was founded in 1792 at Kettering, England. In United States, International Ministries was founded in 1814, and the International Mission Board was founded in 1845.

==Membership==
Membership policies vary due to the autonomy of churches, but generally an individual becomes a member of a church through believer&#x27;s baptism (which is a public profession of faith in Jesus, followed by immersion baptism). Most Baptists do not believe that baptism is a requirement for salvation but rather a public expression of inner repentance and faith. In general, Baptist churches do not have a stated age restriction on membership, but believer&#x27;s baptism requires that an individual be able to freely and earnestly profess their faith.

In 2010, an estimated 100 million Christians identified as Baptist or belonging to a Baptist-type church. In 2020, according to the researcher Sébastien Fath of the CNRS, the Baptist movement has around 170 million believers in the world. According to a census released in 2024, the BWA includes 266 participating fellowships in 134 countries, with 178,000 churches and 51 million baptized members. These statistics may not be fully representative, however, since some churches in the United States have dual or triple national Baptist affiliation, causing a church and its members to be counted possibly by more than one Baptist association, if these associations are members of the BWA.

Among the censuses carried out by individual Baptist associations in 2023, those which claimed the most members on each continent were:

==Beliefs==
Since the early days of the Baptist movement, various associations have adopted common confessions of faith as the basis for cooperative work among churches. Each church has a particular confession of faith and a common confession of faith if it is a member of an association of churches. Some historically significant Baptist doctrinal documents include the 1689 London Baptist Confession of Faith, 1742 Philadelphia Baptist Confession, the 1833 New Hampshire Baptist Confession of Faith, and written church covenants which some individual Baptist churches adopt as a statement of their faith and beliefs.

Baptist theology shares many doctrines with evangelical theology. It is based on believers&#x27; Church doctrine. Baptists, like other Christians, are defined by school of thought—some of it common to all orthodox and evangelical groups, and a portion of it distinctive to Baptists. Through the years, different Baptist groups have issued confessions of faith—without considering them to be &quot;creeds&quot;—to express their particular doctrinal distinctions in comparison to other Christians as well as in comparison to other Baptists. Baptist denominations are traditionally seen as belonging to two parties, General Baptists who uphold Arminian theology, and Particular Baptists who uphold Reformed theology (Calvinism). During the holiness movement, some General Baptists accepted the teaching of a second work of grace and formed denominations that emphasized this belief, such as the Ohio Valley Association of the Christian Baptist Churches of God and the Holiness Baptist Association. Most Baptists are evangelical in doctrine, but their beliefs may vary due to the congregational governance system that gives autonomy to individual local Baptist churches. Historically, Baptists have played a key role in encouraging religious freedom and the doctrine of separation of church and state.

Shared doctrines would include beliefs about one God; the virgin birth of Jesus; miracles; substitutionary atonement for sins through the death, burial, and bodily resurrection of Jesus; the Trinity; the need for salvation (through belief in Jesus Christ as the Son of God, his death and resurrection); grace; the Kingdom of God; last things (eschatology) (Jesus Christ will return personally and visibly in glory to Earth; the dead will be raised; and Christ will judge everyone in righteousness); and evangelism and missions.

Most Baptists hold that no church or ecclesiastical organization has inherent authority over a Baptist church. Churches can properly relate to each other under this polity only through voluntary cooperation, never by any sort of coercion. Furthermore, this Baptist polity calls for freedom from governmental control. Exceptions to this local form of local governance include a few churches that submit to the leadership of a body of elders, as well as the Episcopal Baptists who have an Episcopal system.

Baptists generally believe in the literal Second Coming of Christ. Beliefs among Baptists regarding the &quot;end times&quot; include amillennialism, both dispensational and historic premillennialism, with views such as postmillennialism and preterism receiving some support.

Some additional distinctive Baptist principles held by many Baptists:
* The supremacy of the canonical Scriptures as a norm of faith and practice. For something to become a matter of faith and practice, it is not sufficient for it to be merely &quot;consistent with&quot; and not contrary to scriptural principles. It must be something &quot;explicitly&quot; ordained through command or example in the Bible. For instance, this is why Baptists do not practice infant baptism: they say the Bible neither commands nor exemplifies infant baptism as a Christian practice. More than any other Baptist principle, this one when applied to infant baptism is said to separate Baptists from other evangelical Christians.
* Baptists believe that faith is a matter between God and the individual. It is connected in theory with the advocacy of absolute liberty of conscience.
* Insistence on immersion believer&#x27;s baptism as the only mode of baptism. Baptists do not believe that baptism is necessary for salvation. Therefore, for Baptists, baptism is an ordinance, not a sacrament, since in their view it imparts no saving grace.

===Beliefs that vary among Baptists===

Since there is no hierarchical authority and each Baptist church is autonomous, there is no official set of Baptist theological beliefs. These differences exist among associations and even among churches within the associations. Some doctrinal issues on which there is widespread difference among Baptists are:

* Eschatology
* Arminianism versus Calvinism (General Baptists uphold Arminian theology while Particular Baptists teach Calvinist theology). 
* The doctrine of separation from &quot;the world&quot; and whether to associate with those who are &quot;of the world&quot;
* Belief in a second work of grace, i.e. entire sanctification (held by General Baptists in the Holiness tradition)
* Speaking-in-tongues and the operation of other charismatic gifts of the Holy Spirit in the charismatic churches
* How the Bible should be interpreted (hermeneutics)
* The extent to which missionary boards should be used to support missionaries
* The extent to which non-members may participate in the Lord&#x27;s Supper services
* Which translation of Scripture to use (e.g., King James Only movement)
* Dispensationalism versus Covenant theology
* The role of women in marriage
* The ordination of women as deacons or pastors.
* Attitudes to and involvement in the ecumenical movement.
* The role of repentance and perseverance in salvation (Lordship salvation controversy).
* How to distinguish the persons of the trinity (social trinitarianism and classical trinitarianism).

Excommunication may be used as a last resort by some denominations and churches for members who do not want to repent of beliefs or behavior at odds with the confession of faith of the community. When an entire congregation is excluded, it is often called disfellowship.

== Types of Baptists ==

=== General Baptists ===
General Baptists are Baptists who hold to the view of unlimited atonement, believing that God died for every human being and not just the elect. These Baptists are generally closer to Arminian theology, and the Free Will Baptists belong to this grouping. 

The General Baptists also emerged from English Separatists, who contended that the Church of England was a false church, from which one should separate from completely.

=== Particular Baptists ===
The Particular Baptists or Reformed Baptists are Baptists who hold to the Calvinistic view of salvation. Depending on the denomination, Calvinistic Baptists adhere to varying degrees of Reformed theology, ranging from simply embracing the Five Points of Calvinism, to accepting a modified form of federalism; all Calvinistic Baptists reject the classical Reformed teaching on infant baptism. While the Reformed Baptist confessions affirm views of the nature of baptism similar to those of the classical Reformed, they reject infants as the proper subjects of baptism.

In distinction to the General Baptists who emphasized separation from the Church of England, the Particular Baptists sought more ecumenism.

=== Missionary Baptists ===
The Missionary Baptists were a grounp of Baptists that came from the missionary controversy in the United States, where the Missionary Baptists supported the usage of missionaries.

=== Primitive Baptists ===
Primitive Baptists are a type of Baptists who adhere to some type of Calvinistic beliefs, who came out of the controversy among Baptists on the use of mission boards, tract societies and temperamence societies. Primitive Baptists reject some elements of classical Reformed theology, such as infant baptism, and avoid the term &quot;Calvinist&quot;. They are still Calvinist in the sense of holding strongly to the Five Points of Calvinism and they explicitly reject Arminianism. They are also characterized by &quot;intense conservatism&quot;.

=== Independent Baptists ===
Independent Baptists are Baptists who arose from local Baptist congregations whose members were concerned about the doctrines of theological liberalism in national Baptist conventions. Independent Baptists are primarily fundamentalist, and although they may differ on multiple issues such as soteriology, dress standards, music, the practice of communion among others, they are homogenous on issues such as opposition to homosexuality, ordination of women, the charismatic movement, evolution and abortion.

==== New Independent Baptists ====
During the 21st century, the New Independent Fundamental Baptist movement was founded out of the Independent Baptist movement by Steven Anderson. However, this movement has been heavily criticized by Independent Baptists due to many doctrinal differences. Some former New IFB pastors have also charged the association of being a cult.

=== Seventh Day Baptists ===
Seventh Day Baptists are Baptists who practice Sabbatarianism. However, it is not certain when Seventh Day Baptists took denominational form, and they do not claim an unbroken succession od church organization from before the Reformation.

=== Landmark Baptists ===
Landmark Baptists are a Baptist movement which originated in the 19th century in United States, with leaders such as J. R. Graves, J. M. Pendleton and A. C. Dayton, although they denied being a new movement, but a continuation of the old-fashioned Baptists. Landmark Baptists believe that the term &quot;church&quot; should be reserved for Baptist churches exclusively, arguing that groups such as Methodists or Presbyterians are not churches at all, but only religious societies. They believe that Baptists share an unbroken line of succession from the early church.

==Worship==
In Baptist churches, worship service is part of the life of the church and includes praise, worship, of prayers to God, a sermon based on the Bible, offering, and periodically the Lord&#x27;s Supper. Some churches have services with traditional Christian music, others with contemporary Christian music, and some offer both in separate services. In many churches, there are services adapted for children, even teenagers. Prayer meetings are also held during the week.

The architecture is generally sober, and the Latin cross is one of the only spiritual symbols that can usually be seen on the building of a Baptist church and that identifies the place where it belongs.

== Education ==
Baptist churches established elementary and secondary schools, Bible colleges, colleges and universities as early as the 1680s in England, before continuing in various countries. In 2006, the International Association of Baptist Colleges and Universities was founded in the United States. In 2023, it had 42 member universities.

== Sexuality ==
Many churches promote virginity pledges to young Baptist Christians, who are invited to engage in a public ceremony of sexual abstinence until Christian marriage. This pact is often symbolized by a purity ring. Programs like True Love Waits, founded in 1993 by the Southern Baptist Convention have been developed to support the commitments.

Most Baptist associations around the world believe only in marriage between a man and a woman. Some Baptist associations do not have official beliefs about marriage in a confession of faith and invoke congregationalism to leave the choice to each church to decide. This is the case of American Baptist Churches USA, Progressive National Baptist Convention (USA), Cooperative Baptist Fellowship (USA), National Baptist Convention, USA and the Baptist Union of Great Britain. Some Baptist associations support same-sex marriage. This is the case of the Alliance of Baptists (USA), the Canadian Association for Baptist Freedoms, the Aliança de Batistas do Brasil, the Fraternidad de Iglesias Bautistas de Cuba, and the Association of Welcoming and Affirming Baptists (international).

==Controversies==
Baptists have faced many controversies in their 400-year history, controversies of the level of crises. Baptist historian Walter Shurden says the word &quot;crisis&quot; comes from the Greek word meaning &#x27;to decide.&#x27; Shurden writes that contrary to the presumed negative view of crises, some controversies that reach a crisis level may actually be &quot;positive and highly productive.&quot; He claims that even schism, though never ideal, has often produced positive results. In his opinion, crises among Baptists each have become decision moments that shaped their future.

===Missions crisis===
Early in the 19th century, the rise of the modern missions movement, and the backlash against it, led to widespread and bitter controversy among the American Baptists. During this era, the American Baptists were split between missionary and anti-missionary. A substantial secession of Baptists went into the movement led by Alexander Campbell to return to a more fundamental church.

===Slavery crisis===
====United States====
Leading up to the American Civil War, Baptists became embroiled in the controversy over slavery in the United States. Whereas in the First Great Awakening, Methodist and Baptist preachers had opposed slavery and urged manumission, over the decades they made more of an accommodation with the institution. They worked with slaveholders in the South to urge a paternalistic institution. Both denominations made direct appeals to slaves and free Blacks for conversion. The Baptists particularly allowed them active roles in congregations. By the mid-19th century, northern Baptists tended to oppose slavery. As tensions increased, in 1844 the Home Mission Society refused to appoint a slaveholder as a missionary who had been proposed by Georgia. It noted that missionaries could not take servants with them, and also that the board did not want to appear to condone slavery.

In 1845 a group of churches in favor of slavery and in disagreement with the abolitionism of the Triennial Convention (now American Baptist Churches USA) left to form the Southern Baptist Convention. They believed that the Bible sanctions slavery and that it was acceptable for Christians to own slaves. They believed slavery was a human institution which Baptist teaching could make less harsh. By this time many planters were part of Baptist congregations, and some of the denomination&#x27;s prominent preachers, such as Basil Manly Sr., president of the University of Alabama, were also planters who owned slaves.

As early as the late 18th century, Black Baptists began to organize separate churches, associations and mission agencies. Blacks set up some independent Baptist congregations in the South before the Civil War. White Baptist associations maintained some oversight of these churches.

In the postwar years, freedmen quickly left the white congregations and associations, setting up their own churches. In 1866, the Consolidated American Baptist Convention, formed from Black Baptists of the South and West, helped southern associations set up Black state conventions, which they did in Alabama, Arkansas, Virginia, North Carolina, and Kentucky. In 1880, Black state conventions united in the national Foreign Mission Convention to support Black Baptist missionary work. Two other national Black conventions were formed, and in 1895 they united as the National Baptist Convention. This organization later went through its own changes, spinning off other conventions. It is the largest Black religious organization and the second-largest Baptist organization in the world. Baptists are numerically most dominant in the Southeast. In 2007, the Pew Research Center&#x27;s Religious Landscape Survey found that 45% of all African Americans identify with Baptist denominations, with the vast majority of those being within the historically Black tradition.

In the American South, the interpretation of the Civil War, abolition of slavery and postwar period has differed sharply by race since those years. Americans have often interpreted great events in religious terms. Historian Wilson Fallin contrasts the interpretation of Civil War and Reconstruction in White versus Black memory by analyzing Baptist sermons documented in Alabama. They quickly organized their own congregations and developed their own regional and state associations and, by the end of the 19th century, a national convention.

White preachers in Alabama after Reconstruction expressed the view that:

Black preachers interpreted the Civil War, Emancipation and Reconstruction as &quot;God&#x27;s gift of freedom.&quot; They had a gospel of liberation, having long identified with the Book of Exodus from slavery in the Old Testament. They took opportunities to exercise their independence, to worship in their own way, to affirm their worth and dignity, and to proclaim the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man. Most of all, they quickly formed their own churches, associations, and conventions to operate freely without white supervision. These institutions offered self-help and racial uplift, a place to develop and use leadership, and places for proclamation of the gospel of liberation. As a result, Black preachers said that God would protect and help him and God&#x27;s people; God would be their rock in a stormy land.

The Southern Baptist Convention supported white supremacy and its results: disenfranchising most Blacks and many poor whites at the turn of the 20th century by raising barriers to voter registration, and passage of racial segregation laws that enforced the system of Jim Crow. Its members largely resisted the civil rights movement in the South, which sought to enforce their constitutional rights for public access and voting; and enforcement of midcentury federal civil rights laws.

In 1995, the Southern Baptist Convention passed a resolution that recognized the failure of their ancestors to protect the civil rights of African Americans. More than 20,000 Southern Baptists registered for the meeting in Atlanta. The resolution declared that messengers, as SBC delegates are called, &quot;unwaveringly denounce racism, in all its forms, as deplorable sin&quot; and &quot;lament and repudiate historic acts of evil such as slavery from which we continue to reap a bitter harvest.&quot; It offered an apology to all African Americans for &quot;condoning and/or perpetuating individual and systemic racism in our lifetime&quot; and repentance for &quot;racism of which we have been guilty, whether consciously or unconsciously.&quot; Although Southern Baptists have condemned racism in the past, this was the first time the convention, predominantly White since the Reconstruction era, had specifically addressed the issue of slavery.

The statement sought forgiveness &quot;from our African-American brothers and sisters&quot; and pledged to &quot;eradicate racism in all its forms from Southern Baptist life and ministry.&quot; In 1995, about 500,000 members of the 15.6-million-member denomination were African Americans and another 300,000 were ethnic minorities. The resolution marked the denomination&#x27;s first formal acknowledgment that racism played a role in its founding.

====Caribbean islands====
Elsewhere in the Americas, in the Caribbean in particular, Baptist missionaries and members took an active role in the anti-slavery movement. In Jamaica, for example, William Knibb, a prominent British Baptist missionary, worked toward the emancipation of slaves in the British West Indies (which took place in full in 1838). Knibb supported the creation of &quot;Free Villages&quot; and sought funding from English Baptists to buy land for freedmen to cultivate; the Free Villages were envisioned as rural communities to be centered around a Baptist church where emancipated slaves could farm their own land. Thomas Burchell, missionary minister in Montego Bay, was active in this movement, gaining funds from Baptists in England to buy land for what became known as Burchell Free Village.

Prior to emancipation, Baptist deacon Samuel Sharpe, who served with Burchell, organized a general strike of slaves seeking better conditions. It developed into a major rebellion of as many as 60,000 slaves, which became known as the Christmas Rebellion or the Baptist War. It was put down by government troops within two weeks. During and after the rebellion, an estimated 200 slaves were killed outright, with more than 300 judicially executed later by prosecution in the courts, sometimes for minor offenses.

Baptists were active after emancipation in promoting the education of former slaves; for example, Jamaica&#x27;s Calabar High School, named after the port of Calabar in Nigeria, was founded by Baptist missionaries. At the same time, during and after slavery, slaves and free Blacks formed their own Spiritual Baptist movements—breakaway spiritual movements which theology often expressed resistance to oppression.

===Landmark crisis===
Southern Baptist Landmarkism sought to reset the ecclesiastical separation which had characterized the old Baptist churches, in an era when inter-denominational union meetings were the order of the day. James Robinson Graves was an influential Baptist of the 19th century and the primary leader of this movement. While some Landmarkers eventually separated from the Southern Baptist Convention, the movement continued to influence the Convention into the 20th and 21st centuries.

===Modernist crisis===

The rise of theological modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries also greatly affected Baptists. The Landmark movement has been described as a reaction among Southern Baptists in the United States against incipient modernism. In England, Charles Spurgeon fought against modernistic views of the Scripture in the Downgrade Controversy and severed his church from the Baptist Union as a result.

The Northern Baptist Convention in the United States had internal conflict over modernism in the early 20th century, ultimately embracing it. Two new conservative associations of congregations that separated from the convention were founded as a result: the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches in 1933 and the Conservative Baptist Association of America in 1947.

Following similar conflicts over modernism, the Southern Baptist Convention adhered to conservative theology as its official position. In the late 20th century, Southern Baptists who disagreed with this direction founded two new groups: the liberal Alliance of Baptists in 1987 and the more moderate Cooperative Baptist Fellowship in 1991. Originally both schisms continued to identify as Southern Baptist, but over time they &quot;became permanent new families of Baptists.&quot;

===Criticism===
In his 1963 book, &quot;Strength to Love&quot;, Baptist pastor Martin Luther King Jr. criticized some Baptist churches for their anti-intellectualism, especially because of the lack of theological training among pastors.

In 2018, Baptist theologian Russell D. Moore criticized some Baptists in the United States for their moralism emphasizing strongly the condemnation of certain personal sins, but silent on the social injustices that afflict entire populations, such as racism. In 2020, the North American Baptist Fellowship, a region of the Baptist World Alliance, officially made a commitment to social justice and spoke out against institutionalized discrimination in the American justice system. In 2022, the Baptist World Alliance adopted a resolution encouraging Baptist churches and associations that have historically contributed to the sin of slavery to engage in restorative justice.

<text>Blackjack (formerly black jack or vingt-un) is a casino banking game. It is the most widely played casino banking game in the world. It uses decks of 52 cards and descends from a global family of casino banking games known as &quot;twenty-one&quot;. This family of card games also includes the European games &quot;vingt-et-un&quot; and pontoon, and the Russian game . The game is a comparing card game where players compete against the dealer, rather than each other.

==History==
Blackjack&#x27;s immediate precursor was the English version of &quot;twenty-one&quot; called &quot;vingt-un&quot;, a game of unknown provenance. The first written reference is found in a book by the Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes. Cervantes was a gambler, and the protagonists of his &quot;Rinconete y Cortadillo&quot;, from &quot;Novelas Ejemplares&quot;, are card cheats in Seville. They are proficient at cheating at &quot;veintiuno&quot; (Spanish for &quot;twenty-one&quot;) and state that the object of the game is to reach 21 points without going over and that the ace values 1 or 11. The game is played with the Spanish &quot;baraja&quot; deck.

&quot;Rinconete y Cortadillo&quot; was written between 1601 and 1602, implying that &quot;veintiuno&quot; was played in Castile since the beginning of the 17th century or earlier. Later references to this game are found in France and Spain.

The first record of the game in France occurs in 1888 and in Britain during the 1770s and 1780s, but the first rules appeared in Britain in 1800 under the name of &quot;vingt-un&quot;. Twenty-one, still known then as &quot;vingt-un&quot;, appeared in the United States in the early 1800s. The first American rules were an 1825 reprint of the 1800 English rules. English &quot;vingt-un&quot; later developed into an American variant in its own right which was renamed &quot;blackjack&quot; around 1899.

According to popular myth, when &quot;vingt-un&quot; was introduced into the United States (in the early 1800s, during the First World War, or in the 1930s, depending on the source), gambling houses offered bonus payouts to stimulate players&#x27; interests. One such bonus was a ten-to-one payout if the player&#x27;s hand consisted of the ace of spades and a black jack (either the jack of clubs or the jack of spades). This hand was called a &quot;blackjack&quot;, and the name stuck even after the ten-to-one bonus was withdrawn.

French card historian Thierry Depaulis debunks this story, showing that prospectors during the Klondike Gold Rush (1896–99) gave the name &quot;blackjack&quot; to the game of American &quot;vingt-un&quot;, the bonus being the usual ace and any 10-point card. Since &quot;blackjack&quot; also refers to the mineral zincblende, which was often associated with gold or silver deposits, he suggests that the mineral name was transferred by prospectors to the top bonus hand. He could not find any historical evidence for a special bonus for having the combination of an ace and a black jack.

In September 1956, Roger Baldwin, Wilbert Cantey, Herbert Maisel, and James McDermott published a paper titled &quot;The Optimum Strategy in Blackjack&quot; in the &quot;Journal of the American Statistical Association&quot;, the first mathematically sound optimal blackjack strategy. This paper became the foundation of future efforts to beat blackjack. Ed Thorp used Baldwin&#x27;s hand calculations to verify the basic strategy and later published (in 1963) &quot;Beat the Dealer&quot;.

==Rules of play at casinos==
The object of the game is to win money by creating card totals higher than those of the dealer&#x27;s hand but not exceeding 21, or by stopping at a total in the hope that the dealer will bust. Number cards count as their number, the jack, queen, and king (&quot;face cards&quot; or &quot;pictures&quot;) count as 10, and aces count as either 1 or 11 depending on whether or not counting it as 11 would cause a bust. If a player exceeds 21 points, they bust and automatically lose. A total of 21 on the starting two cards is called a &quot;blackjack&quot; or &quot;natural,&quot; and is the strongest hand.

At a blackjack table, the dealer faces five to nine playing positions from behind a semicircular table. Between one and eight standard 52-card decks are shuffled together. To start each round, players place bets in the &quot;betting box&quot; at each position. In jurisdictions allowing back betting, up to three players can be at each position. The player whose bet is at the front of the betting box controls the position, and the dealer consults the controlling player for playing decisions; the other bettors &quot;play behind&quot;. A player can usually bet in one or multiple boxes at a single table, but in many U.S. casinos, players are limited to playing one to three positions at a table.

The dealer deals from their left (&quot;first base&quot;) to their far right (&quot;third base&quot;). Each box gets an initial hand of two cards. The dealer&#x27;s hand gets its first card face-up. In &quot;hole card&quot; games, the dealer also gets a second card face-down (the hole card), and if the first card is a 10-A, the dealer will peek at the hole card to see whether they have a blackjack. If they do, they reveal it immediately. Hole card games are sometimes played on tables with a small mirror or electronic sensor used to peek securely at the hole card. In European casinos, &quot;no hole card&quot; games are prevalent; the dealer&#x27;s second card is not drawn until all the players have played their hands.

Dealers deal the cards from one or two handheld decks, from a dealer&#x27;s shoe or from a shuffling machine. One card is dealt to each wagered-on position clockwise from the dealer&#x27;s left, followed by one card to the dealer, followed by an additional card to each of the positions in play, followed by the dealer&#x27;s hole card if applicable. The players&#x27; initial cards may be dealt face-up or face-down (more common in single and double-deck games).

Once all the hands are dealt, play begins with the player to the left of the dealer and proceeds clockwise.

===Player decisions===
On the initial two cards, the player has up to five options: &quot;hit&quot;, &quot;stand&quot;, &quot;double down&quot;, &quot;split&quot;, or &quot;surrender&quot;. Once a hand has more than two cards, hitting and standing are the only options available. Each option has a corresponding hand signal.
* Hit: Take another card.
: &quot;Signal&quot;: Scrape cards against the table (in handheld games); tap the table with a finger or wave a hand toward the body (in games dealt face-up).
* Stand: Take no more cards; also known as &quot;stand pat&quot;, &quot;sit&quot;, &quot;stick&quot;, or &quot;stay&quot;.
: &quot;Signal&quot;: Slide cards under chips face-down (in handheld games); wave hand horizontally (in games dealt face-up).
* Double down: Increase the initial bet by 100% and take exactly one more card. The additional bet is placed next to the original bet. Some games permit the player to increase the bet by amounts smaller than 100%, which is known as &quot;double for less&quot;. Non-controlling players may or may not double their wager, but they still only take one card.
: &quot;Signal&quot;: Place additional chips beside the original bet outside the betting box and point with one finger.
* Split: Create two hands from a starting hand where both cards are the same value. Each new hand gets a second card resulting in two starting hands. This requires an additional bet on the second hand. The two hands are played out independently, and the wager on each hand is won or lost independently. In the case of cards worth 10 points, some casinos only allow splitting when the cards rank the same. For example, 10-10 could be split, but K-10 could not. Doubling and re-splitting after splitting may be restricted. A 10-valued card and an ace resulting from a split usually isn&#x27;t considered a blackjack. Hitting split aces is often not allowed. Non-controlling players can opt to put up a second bet or not. If they do not, they only get paid or lose on one of the two post-split hands.
: &quot;Signal&quot;: Place additional chips next to the original bet outside the betting box and point with two fingers spread into a V formation.
* Surrender: Forfeit half the bet and end the hand immediately. This option is only available at some tables in some casinos, and is not allowed after splitting.
: &quot;Signal&quot;: Using the index finger, draw a horizontal line behind the bet. Surrender can also be announced verbally.

In handheld games, a player must reveal their cards if they have a blackjack, bust, or wish to double down, split, or surrender.

Hand signals help the &quot;eye in the sky&quot; make a video recording of the table, which resolves disputes and identifies dealer mistakes. It is also used to protect the casino against dealers who steal chips or players who cheat. Recordings can also identify advantage players. When a player&#x27;s hand signal disagrees with their words, the hand signal takes precedence.

After the players have finished playing, the dealer&#x27;s hand is resolved by drawing cards until the hand achieves a total of 17 or higher. If the dealer has a total of 17 including an ace valued as 11 (a &quot;soft 17&quot;), some games require the dealer to stand while other games require the dealer to hit. The dealer never doubles, splits, or surrenders. If the dealer busts, all players who haven&#x27;t busted win. If the dealer does not bust, each remaining bet wins if its hand is higher than the dealer&#x27;s and loses if it is lower. In the case of a tie (&quot;push&quot; or &quot;standoff&quot;), bets are returned without adjustment. A blackjack beats any hand that is not a blackjack, even one with a value of 21.

A player blackjack wins immediately unless the dealer also has one, in which case the hand is a push. If the dealer is dealt blackjack, all players who do not have a blackjack lose.

Wins are paid out at even money, except for player blackjacks, which are traditionally paid out at 3 to 2 odds. Some tables today pay blackjacks at less than 3:2.

===Insurance===
If the dealer shows an ace, an &quot;insurance&quot; bet is allowed. Insurance is a side bet that the dealer has a blackjack. The dealer asks for insurance bets before the first player plays. Insurance bets of up to half the player&#x27;s current bet are placed on the &quot;insurance bar&quot; above the player&#x27;s cards. If the dealer has a blackjack, insurance pays 2 to 1. In most casinos, the dealer looks at the down card and pays off or takes the insurance bet immediately. In other casinos, the payoff waits until the end of the play.

In face-down games, if a player has more than one hand, they can look at all their hands before deciding. This is the only condition where a player can look at multiple hands.

Players with blackjack can also take insurance. When this happens, it is called &#x27;even money,&#x27; as the player is giving up their 3:2 payout for a 1:1 payout when taking insurance with a blackjack, under the condition that they still get paid if the dealer also has a blackjack.

Insurance bets lose money in the long run. The dealer has a blackjack less than one-third of the time. In some games, players can also take insurance when a 10-valued card shows, but the dealer has an ace in the hole less than one-tenth of the time.

The insurance bet is susceptible to advantage play. It is advantageous to make an insurance bet whenever the hole card has more than a one in three chance of being a ten. Card counting techniques can identify such situations.

==Rule variations and effects on house edge==
&quot;Note: Where changes in the house edge due to changes in the rules are stated in percentage terms, the difference is usually stated here in percentage points, not the percentage change. For example, if an edge of 10% is reduced to 9%, it is reduced by one percentage point, not reduced by ten percent.&quot;

Blackjack rules are generally set by regulations that establish permissible rule variations at the casino&#x27;s discretion. Blackjack comes with a &quot;house edge&quot;; the casino&#x27;s statistical advantage is built into the game. Most of the house&#x27;s edge comes from the fact that the player loses when both the player and dealer bust. Blackjack players using basic strategy lose on average less than 1% of their action over the long run, giving blackjack one of the lowest edges in the casino. The house edge for games where blackjack pays 6 to 5 instead of 3 to 2 increases by about 1.4%. Player deviations from basic strategy also increase the house edge.

;Dealer hits soft 17

Each game has a rule about whether the dealer must hit or stand on soft 17, which is generally printed on the table surface. The variation where the dealer must hit soft 17 is abbreviated &quot;H17&quot; in blackjack literature, with &quot;S17&quot; used for the stand-on-soft-17 variation. Substituting an &quot;H17&quot; rule with an &quot;S17&quot; rule in a game benefits the player, decreasing the house edge by about 0.2%.

;Number of decks

All other things equal, using fewer decks decreases the house edge. This is due to a combination of an increased probability of blackjack (which generally pays 3:2 for the player), an increased probability of the dealer busting, and doubling down being more beneficial for the player in a game with fewer decks.

Casinos generally compensate by tightening other rules in games with fewer decks, to preserve the house edge or discourage play altogether. When offering single-deck blackjack games, casinos are more likely to disallow doubling on soft hands or after splitting, restrict resplitting, require higher minimum bets, or pay the player less than 3:2 for a winning blackjack.

The following table illustrates the mathematical effect on the house edge of the number of decks, by considering games with various deck counts under the following ruleset: double after split allowed, resplit to four hands allowed, no hitting split aces, no surrendering, double on any two cards, original bets only lost on dealer blackjack, dealer hits soft 17, and cut-card used. The increase in house edge per unit increase in the number of decks is most dramatic when comparing the single-deck game to the two-deck game, and becomes progressively smaller as more decks are added.

;Late/early surrender:

Surrender, for those games that allow it, is usually not permitted against a dealer blackjack; if the dealer&#x27;s first card is an ace or ten, the hole card is checked to make sure there is no blackjack before surrender is offered. This rule protocol is consequently known as &quot;late&quot; surrender. The alternative, &quot;early&quot; surrender, gives the player the option to surrender &quot;before&quot; the dealer checks for blackjack, or in a no hole card game. Early surrender is much more favorable to the player than late surrender.

For late surrender, however, while it is tempting to opt for surrender on any hand which will probably lose, the correct strategy is to only surrender on the very worst hands, because having even a one-in-four chance of winning the full bet is better than losing half the bet and pushing the other half, as entailed by surrendering.

;Resplitting: 
If the cards of a post-split hand have the same value, most games allow the player to split again, or &quot;resplit&quot;. The player places a further wager, and the dealer separates the new pair dealing a further card to each as before. Some games allow unlimited resplitting, while others may limit it to a certain number of hands, such as four hands (for example, &quot;resplit to 4&quot;).

;Hit/resplit split aces: 
After splitting aces, the common rule is that only one card will be dealt to each ace; the player cannot split, double, or take another hit on either hand. Rule variants include allowing resplitting aces or allowing the player to hit split aces. Games allowing aces to be resplit are not uncommon, but those allowing the player to hit split aces are extremely rare. Allowing the player to hit hands resulting from split aces reduces the house edge by about 0.13%; allowing resplitting of aces reduces the house edge by about 0.03%. Note that a ten-value card dealt on a split ace (or vice versa) will not be counted as a blackjack but as a soft 21.

;No double after split: 
After a split, most games allow doubling down on the new two-card hands. Disallowing doubling after a split increases the house edge by about 0.12%.

;Double on 9/10/11 or 10/11 only: 
Under the &quot;Reno rule&quot;, doubling down is only permitted on hard totals of 9, 10, or 11 (under a similar European rule, only 10 or 11). The basic strategy would otherwise call for some doubling down with hard 9 and soft 13–18, and advanced players can identify situations where doubling on soft 19–20 and hard 8, 7, and even 6 is advantageous. The Reno rule prevents the player from taking advantage of double-down in these situations and thereby increases the player&#x27;s expected loss. The Reno rule increases the house edge by around 0.1%, and its European version by around 0.2%.

;No hole card and OBO:

In most non-U.S. casinos, a &quot;no hole card&quot; game is played, meaning that the dealer does not draw nor consult their second card until after all players have finished making decisions. With no hole card, it is rarely the correct basic strategy to double or split against a dealer ten or ace, since a dealer blackjack will result in the loss of the split and double bets; the only exception is with a pair of aces against a dealer 10, where it is still correct to split. In all other cases, a stand, hit, or surrender is called for. For instance, when holding 11 against a dealer 10, the correct strategy is to double in a hole card game (where the player knows the dealer&#x27;s second card is not an ace), but to hit in a no-hole card game. The no-hole-card rule adds approximately 0.11% to the house edge.

The &quot;original bets only&quot; rule variation appearing in certain no hole card games states that if the player&#x27;s hand loses to a dealer blackjack, only the mandatory initial bet (&quot;original&quot;) is forfeited, and all optional bets, meaning doubles and splits, are pushed. &quot;Original bets only&quot; is also known by the acronym OBO; it has the same effect on basic strategy and the house edge as reverting to a hole card game.

;Altered payout for a winning blackjack: 
In many casinos, a blackjack pays only 6:5 or even 1:1 instead of the usual 3:2. This is most common at tables with lower table minimums. Although this payoff was originally limited to single-deck games, it has spread to double-deck and shoe games. Among common rule variations in the U.S., these altered payouts for blackjack are the most damaging to the player, causing the greatest increase in house edge. Since blackjack occurs in approximately 4.8% of hands, the 1:1 game increases the house edge by 2.3%, while the 6:5 game adds 1.4% to the house edge. Video blackjack machines generally pay a 1:1 payout for a blackjack.

;Dealer wins ties: 
The rule that bets on tied hands are lost rather than pushed is catastrophic to the player. Though rarely used in standard blackjack, it is sometimes seen in &quot;blackjack-like&quot; games, such as in some charity casinos.

==Blackjack strategy==
===Basic strategy===
Each blackjack game has a basic strategy, the optimal method of playing any hand. When using basic strategy, the long-term house advantage (the expected loss of the player) is minimized.

An example of a basic strategy is shown in the table below, which applies to a game with the following specifications: 
* Four to eight decks
* The dealer hits on a soft 17
* A double is allowed after a split
* Only original bets are lost on dealer blackjack

Key:
:S = Stand
:H = Hit
:Dh = Double (if not allowed, then hit)
:Ds = Double (if not allowed, then stand)
:SP = Split
:Uh = Surrender (if not allowed, then hit)
:Us = Surrender (if not allowed, then stand)
:Usp = Surrender (if not allowed, then split)

Most basic strategy decisions are the same for all blackjack games. Rule variations call for changes in only a few situations. For example, to use the table above on a game with the stand-on-soft-17 rule (which favors the player, and is typically found only at higher-limit tables today) only 6 cells would need to be changed: hit on 11 &quot;vs.&quot; A, hit on 15 &quot;vs.&quot; A, stand on 17 &quot;vs.&quot; A, stand on A,7 &quot;vs.&quot; 2, stand on A,8 &quot;vs.&quot; 6, and split on 8,8 &quot;vs.&quot; A. Regardless of the specific rule variations, taking insurance or &quot;even money&quot; is never the correct play under a basic strategy.

Estimates of the house edge for blackjack games quoted by casinos and gaming regulators are based on the assumption that the players follow basic strategy.

Most blackjack games have a house edge of between 0.5% and 1%, placing blackjack among the cheapest casino table games for the player. Casino promotions such as complimentary matchplay vouchers or 2:1 blackjack payouts allow players to acquire an advantage without deviating from basic strategy.

===Composition-dependent strategy===
The basic strategy is based on a player&#x27;s point total and the dealer&#x27;s visible card. Players can sometimes improve on this decision by considering the composition of their hand, not just the point total. For example, players should ordinarily stand when holding 12 against a dealer 4. But in a single deck game, players should hit if their 12 consists of a 10 and a 2. The presence of a 10 in the player&#x27;s hand has two consequences:
* It makes the player&#x27;s 12 a worse hand to stand on (since the only way to avoid losing is for the dealer to go bust, which is less likely if there are fewer 10s left in the shoe).
* It makes hitting safer, since the only way of going bust is to draw a 10, and this is less likely with a 10 already in the hand.

Even when basic and composition-dependent strategies lead to different actions, the difference in expected reward is small, and it becomes smaller with more decks. Using a composition-dependent strategy rather than a basic strategy in a single-deck game reduces the house edge by 4 in 10,000, which falls to 3 in 100,000 for a six-deck game.

===Advantage play===

Blackjack has been a high-profile target for advantage players since the 1960s. Advantage play attempts to win more using skills such as memory, computation, and observation. While these techniques are legal, they can give players a mathematical edge in the game, making advantage players unwanted customers for casinos. Advantage play can lead to ejection or blacklisting. Some advantageous play techniques in blackjack include:

====Card counting====
During the course of a blackjack shoe, the dealer exposes the dealt cards. Players can infer from their accounting of the exposed cards which cards remain. These inferences can be used in the following ways:
* Players can make larger bets when they have an advantage. For example, the players can increase the starting bet if many aces and tens are left in the deck, in the hope of hitting a blackjack.
* Players can deviate from basic strategy according to the composition of their undealt cards. For example, with many tens left in the deck, players might double down in more situations since there is a better chance of getting a good hand.

A card counting system assigns a point score to each card rank (e.g., 1 point for 2–6, 0 points for 7–9, and −1 point for 10–A). When a card is exposed, a counter adds the score of that card to a running total, the &#x27;count&#x27;. A card counter uses this count to make betting and playing decisions. The count starts at 0 for a freshly shuffled deck for &quot;balanced&quot; counting systems. Unbalanced counts are often started at a value that depends on the number of decks used in the game.

Blackjack&#x27;s house edge is usually around 0.5–1% when players use basic strategy. Card counting can give the player an edge of up to about 2%.

Card counting works best when a few cards remain. This makes single-deck games better for counters. As a result, casinos are more likely to insist that players do not reveal their cards to one another in single-deck games. In games with more decks, casinos limit penetration by ending the shoe and reshuffling when one or more decks remain undealt. Casinos also sometimes use a shuffling machine to reintroduce the cards whenever a deck has been played.

Card counting is legal, but a casino might inform counters that they are no longer welcome to play blackjack. Sometimes a casino might ban a card counter from the property. The use of external devices to assist in card counting is illegal in Nevada.

====Shuffle tracking====

Another advantage play technique, mainly applicable in multi-deck games, involves tracking groups of cards (also known as slugs, clumps, or packs) through the shuffle and then playing and betting according to when those cards come into play from a new shoe. Shuffle tracking requires excellent eyesight and powers of visual estimation but is harder to detect; shuffle trackers&#x27; actions are largely unrelated to the composition of the cards in the shoe.

Arnold Snyder&#x27;s articles in &quot;Blackjack Forum&quot; magazine brought shuffle tracking to the general public. His book, &quot;The Shuffle Tracker&#x27;s Cookbook&quot;, mathematically analyzed the player edge available from shuffle tracking based on the actual size of the tracked slug. Jerry L. Patterson also developed and published a shuffle-tracking method for tracking favorable clumps of cards and cutting them into play and tracking unfavorable clumps of cards and cutting them out of play.

====Identifying concealed cards====
The player can also gain an advantage by identifying cards from distinctive wear markings on their backs, or by hole carding (observing during the dealing process the front of a card dealt face-down). These methods are generally legal although their status in particular jurisdictions may vary.

==Side bets==
Many blackjack tables offer side bets on various outcomes including:
*Player hand and dealer&#x27;s up card total 19, 20, or 21 (&quot;Lucky Lucky&quot;)
*Player initial hand is a pair (&quot;Perfect pairs&quot;)
*Player initial hand is suited, and connected, or a suited K-Q (&quot;Royal match&quot;)
*Player initial hand plus dealer&#x27;s card makes a flush, straight, or three-of-a-kind poker hand (&quot;21+3&quot;)
*Player initial hand totals 20 (&quot;Lucky Ladies&quot;)
*Dealer upcard is in between the value of the player&#x27;s two cards (&quot;In Bet&quot;)
*First card drawn to the dealer will result in a dealer bust (&quot;Bust It!&quot;)
*One or both of the player&#x27;s cards is the same as the dealer&#x27;s card (&quot;Match the Dealer&quot;)

The side wager is typically placed in a designated area next to the box for the main wager. A player wishing to wager on a side bet usually must place a wager on blackjack. Some games require that the blackjack wager should equal or exceed any side bet wager. A non-controlling player of a blackjack hand is usually permitted to place a side bet regardless of whether the controlling player does so.

The house edge for side bets is generally higher than for the blackjack game itself. Nonetheless, side bets can be susceptible to card counting. A side count designed specifically for a particular side bet can improve the player&#x27;s edge. Only a few side bets, like &quot;Insurance&quot; and &quot;Lucky Ladies&quot;, correlate well with the high-low counting system and offer a sufficient win rate to justify the effort of advantage play.

In team play, it is common for team members to be dedicated to only counting a side bet using a specialized count.

==Video blackjack==
Some casinos, as well as general betting outlets, provide blackjack among a selection of casino-style games at electronic consoles. Video blackjack game rules are generally more favorable to the house; e.g., paying out only even money for winning blackjacks. Video and online blackjack games generally deal each round from a fresh shoe (i.e., use an RNG for each deal), rendering card counting ineffective in most situations.

==Variants and related games==

Blackjack is a member of the family of traditional card games played recreationally worldwide. Most of these games have not been adapted for casino play. Furthermore, the casino game development industry actively produces blackjack variants, most of which are ultimately not adopted by casinos. The following are the most prominent and established variants in casinos.

*&quot;Spanish 21&quot; provides players with liberal rules, such as doubling down any number of cards (with the option to &quot;rescue&quot;, or surrender only one wager to the house), payout bonuses for five or more card 21s, 6–7–8 21s, 7–7–7 21s, late surrender, and player blackjacks and player 21s always winning. The trade-off is having no 10s in the deck, although the jacks, queens, and kings are still there. An unlicensed version of Spanish 21 played without a hole card is found in Australian casinos under the name &quot;pontoon&quot;.
*&quot;21st-century blackjack&quot; (or &quot;Vegas-style blackjack&quot;) is found in California card rooms. In variations, a player bust does not always result in an automatic loss; depending on the casino, the player can still push if the dealer also busts. The dealer has to bust with a higher total, though.
*&quot;Double exposure blackjack&quot; deals the first two cards of the dealer&#x27;s hand face up. Blackjacks pay even money, and players lose on ties. Also, players can neither buy insurance nor surrender.
*&quot;Double attack blackjack&quot; has liberal blackjack rules and the option of increasing one&#x27;s wager after seeing the dealer&#x27;s up card. This game is dealt from a Spanish shoe, and blackjacks only pay even money.
*&quot;Blackjack switch&quot; is played over two hands, and the second card can be switched between hands. For example, if the player is dealt 10–6 and 5–10, then the player can switch two cards to make hands of 10–10 and 6–5. Natural blackjacks are paid 1:1 instead of the standard 3:2, and a dealer 22 is a push.
*&quot;Super Fun 21&quot; allows a player to split a hand up to four times. If the player has six cards totaling 20, they automatically win. Wins are paid 1:1.
*In &quot;New Years 31,&quot; the card limit is 31 instead of 21, with 14 beating 30. Additionally, the players have to bet on themselves and if they want to bet on other players depending on the starting card. Then, the only player action per round after that is either a hit or pass. Passing results in the dealer continuing to the next player.

Examples of local traditional and recreational related games include French &quot;vingt-et-un&quot; (&#x27;twenty-one&#x27;) and German &quot;Siebzehn und Vier&quot; (&#x27;seventeen and four&#x27;). Neither game allows splitting. An ace counts only eleven, but two aces count as a blackjack. It is mostly played in private circles and barracks. The popular British member of the &quot;vingt-un&quot; family is called &quot;pontoon&quot;, the name being probably a corruption of &quot;vingt-et-un&quot;.

==Blackjack Hall of Fame==
In 2002, professional gamblers worldwide were invited to nominate great blackjack players for admission into the Blackjack Hall of Fame. Seven members were inducted in 2002, with new people inducted every year after. The Hall of Fame is at the Barona Casino in San Diego. Members include Edward O. Thorp, author of the 1960s book &quot;Beat the Dealer&quot;; Ken Uston, who popularized the concept of team play; Arnold Snyder, author and editor of the &quot;Blackjack Forum&quot; trade journal; and Stanford Wong, author and popularizer of &quot;Wonging&quot;.

<text>In inorganic chemistry, bicarbonate (IUPAC-recommended nomenclature: hydrogencarbonate) is an intermediate form in the deprotonation of carbonic acid. It is a polyatomic anion with the chemical formula .

Bicarbonate serves a crucial biochemical role in the physiological pH buffering system.

The term &quot;bicarbonate&quot; was coined in 1814 by the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston. The name lives on as a trivial name.

==Chemical properties==
The bicarbonate ion (hydrogencarbonate ion) is an anion with the empirical formula and a molecular mass of 61.01 daltons; it consists of one central carbon atom surrounded by three oxygen atoms in a trigonal planar arrangement, with a hydrogen atom attached to one of the oxygens. It is isoelectronic with nitric acid . The bicarbonate ion carries a negative one formal charge and is an amphiprotic species which has both acidic and basic properties. It is both the conjugate base of carbonic acid ; and the conjugate acid of , the carbonate ion, as shown by these equilibrium reactions:

: + 2 H2O + H2O + OH− H2CO3 + 2 OH−

:H2CO3 + 2 H2O + H3O+ + H2O + 2 H3O+.

A bicarbonate salt forms when a positively charged ion attaches to the negatively charged oxygen atoms of the ion, forming an ionic compound. Many bicarbonates are soluble in water at standard temperature and pressure; in particular, sodium bicarbonate contributes to total dissolved solids, a common parameter for assessing water quality.

==Physiological role==

Bicarbonate () is a vital component of the pH buffering system of the human body (maintaining acid–base homeostasis). 70%–75% of CO2 in the body is converted into carbonic acid (H2CO3), which is the conjugate acid of and can quickly turn into it.

With carbonic acid as the central intermediate species, bicarbonate – in conjunction with water, hydrogen ions, and carbon dioxide – forms this buffering system, which is maintained at the volatile equilibrium required to provide prompt resistance to pH changes in both the acidic and basic directions. This is especially important for protecting tissues of the central nervous system, where pH changes too far outside of the normal range in either direction could prove disastrous (see acidosis or alkalosis). Recently it has been also demonstrated that cellular bicarbonate metabolism can be regulated by mTORC1 signaling.

Additionally, bicarbonate plays a key role in the digestive system. It raises the internal pH of the stomach, after highly acidic digestive juices have finished in their digestion of food. Bicarbonate also acts to regulate pH in the small intestine. It is released from the pancreas in response to the hormone secretin to neutralize the acidic chyme entering the duodenum from the stomach.

==Bicarbonate in the environment==
Bicarbonate is the dominant form of dissolved inorganic carbon in sea water, and in most fresh waters. As such it is an important sink in the carbon cycle.

Some plants like &quot;Chara&quot; utilize carbonate and produce calcium carbonate (CaCO3) as result of biological metabolism.

In freshwater ecology, strong photosynthetic activity by freshwater plants in daylight releases gaseous oxygen into the water and at the same time produces bicarbonate ions. These shift the pH upward until in certain circumstances the degree of alkalinity can become toxic to some organisms or can make other chemical constituents such as ammonia toxic. In darkness, when no photosynthesis occurs, respiration processes release carbon dioxide, and no new bicarbonate ions are produced, resulting in a rapid fall in pH.

The flow of bicarbonate ions from rocks weathered by the carbonic acid in rainwater is an important part of the carbon cycle.

==Other uses==
The most common salt of the bicarbonate ion is sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO3, which is commonly known as baking soda. When heated or exposed to an acid such as acetic acid (vinegar), sodium bicarbonate releases carbon dioxide. This is used as a leavening agent in baking.

Ammonium bicarbonate is used in the manufacturing of some cookies, crackers, and biscuits.

==Diagnostics==
In diagnostic medicine, the blood value of bicarbonate is one of several indicators of the state of acid–base physiology in the body. It is measured, along with chloride, potassium, and sodium, to assess electrolyte levels in an electrolyte panel test (which has Current Procedural Terminology, CPT, code 80051).

The parameter &quot;standard bicarbonate concentration&quot; (SBCe) is the bicarbonate concentration in the blood at a PaCO2 of , full oxygen saturation and 36 °C.

<text>Bernard Allan Federko (born May 12, 1956) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey centre who played fourteen seasons in the National Hockey League from 1976 through 1990.

==Playing career==
Federko began playing hockey at a young age in his home town of Foam Lake, Saskatchewan. He was captain of the 1971 Bantam provincial champions. He also played Senior hockey with the local Foam Lake Flyers of the Fishing Lake Hockey League, winning the league scoring title as a bantam-aged player. Federko continued his career with the Saskatoon Blades of the WHL where he set and still holds the team record for assists. He played three seasons with the Blades, and in his final year with the club he led the league in assists and points in both the regular season &quot;and&quot; playoffs. Federko was drafted 7th overall by the St. Louis Blues in the 1976 NHL Amateur Draft. He started the next season with the Kansas City Blues of the Central Hockey League and was leading the league in points when he was called up mid-season to play 31 games with St. Louis. He scored three hat tricks in those 31 games. In the 1978–79 NHL season, Federko developed into a bona fide star, as he scored 95 points.

Federko scored 100 points in a season four times, and was a consistent and underrated performer for the Blues. Federko scored at least 90 points in seven of the eight seasons between 1978 and 1986, and became the first player in NHL history to record at least 50 assists in 10 consecutive seasons. However, in an era when Wayne Gretzky was scoring 200 points a season, Federko never got the attention many felt he deserved. In 1986, in a poll conducted by GOAL magazine, he was named the most overlooked talent in hockey. His General Manager Ron Caron said he was &quot;A great playmaker. He makes the average or above average player look like a star at times. He&#x27;s such an unselfish player.&quot;

On March 19, 1988, Federko became the 22nd NHL player to record 1000 career points. After he had a poor season as a captain in 1988–89, he was traded to the Detroit Red Wings with Tony McKegney for future Blues star Adam Oates, and Paul MacLean. In Detroit, Federko re-united with former Blues head coach Jacques Demers, but he had to play behind Steve Yzerman and did not get his desired ice time. After his lowest point output since his rookie season, Federko decided to retire after the 1989–90 season, having played exactly 1,000 NHL games with his final game on April 1, 1990.

==Post-NHL career==
Less than a year after retiring as a player, the Blues retired number 24 in his honour on March 16, 1991. Federko was eventually inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2002, the first Hall of Famer to earn his credentials primarily as a Blue.

Currently, Federko is a television colour commentator and studio analyst for Bally Sports Midwest during Blues broadcasts. He was the head coach/general manager of the St. Louis Vipers roller hockey team of the Roller Hockey International for the 1993 and 1994 seasons.

<text>Buffalo is a city in the U.S. state of New York and the county seat of Erie County. It lies in Western New York at the eastern end of Lake Erie, at the head of the Niagara River on the Canadian border. With a population of 278,349 according to the 2020 census, Buffalo is the second-most populous city in New York State after New York City, and the 81st-most populous city in the U.S. Buffalo is the primary city of the Buffalo–Niagara Falls metropolitan area, which had an estimated population of 1.1 million in 2020, making it the 49th-largest metro area in the U.S.

Before the 17th century, the region was inhabited by nomadic Paleo-Indians who were succeeded by the Neutral, Erie, and Iroquois nations. In the early 17th century, the French began to explore the region. In the 18th century, Iroquois land surrounding Buffalo Creek was ceded through the Holland Land Purchase, and a small village was established at its headwaters. In 1825, after its harbor was improved, Buffalo was selected as the terminus of the Erie Canal, which led to its incorporation in 1832. The canal stimulated its growth as the primary inland port between the Great Lakes and the Atlantic Ocean. Transshipment made Buffalo the world&#x27;s largest grain port of that era. After the coming of railroads greatly reduced the canal&#x27;s importance, the city became the second-largest railway hub (after Chicago). During the mid-19th century, Buffalo transitioned to manufacturing, which came to be dominated by steel production. Later, deindustrialization and the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway saw the city&#x27;s economy decline and diversify. It developed its service industries, such as health care, retail, tourism, logistics, and education, while retaining some manufacturing. In 2019, the gross domestic product of the Buffalo–Niagara Falls MSA was $53 billion (~$ in ).

The city&#x27;s cultural landmarks include the oldest urban parks system in the United States, the Buffalo AKG Art Museum, the Buffalo History Museum, the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra, Shea&#x27;s Performing Arts Center, the Buffalo Museum of Science, and several annual festivals. Its educational institutions include the University at Buffalo, Buffalo State University, Canisius University, and D&#x27;Youville University. Buffalo is also known for its winter weather, Buffalo wings, and two major-league sports teams: the National Football League&#x27;s Buffalo Bills and the National Hockey League&#x27;s Buffalo Sabres.

==History==

===Pre-Columbian era to European exploration===

Before the arrival of Europeans, nomadic Paleo-Indians inhabited the western New York region from the 8th millennium BCE. The Woodland period began around 1000 BC, marked by the rise of the Iroquois Confederacy and the spread of its tribes throughout the state. Seventeenth-century Jesuit missionaries were the first Europeans to visit the area.

During French exploration of the region in 1620, the region was sparsely populated and occupied by the agrarian Erie people in the south and the Neutral Nation in the north, with a relatively small tribe, the Wenrohronon, between and the Senecas, an Iroquois tribe, occupying the land just east of the region. The Neutral grew tobacco and hemp to trade with the Iroquois, who traded furs with the French for European goods. The tribes used animal- and war paths to travel and move goods across what today is New York State. (Centuries later, these same paths were gradually improved, then paved, then developed into major modern roads.) Traditional Seneca oral legends, as recounted by professional storytellers known as Hagéotâ, were highly participatory. These tales were told only during winter, as they were believed to have the power to put even animals and plants to sleep, which could affect the harvest. At the conclusion, audience members typically offered gifts, such as tobacco, to the storyteller as a sign of appreciation. During the Beaver Wars in the mid-17th century the Senecas conquered the Erie and Neutrals in the region. Native Americans did not settle along Buffalo Creek permanently until 1780, when displaced Senecas were relocated from Fort Niagara.

Louis Hennepin and Sieur de La Salle explored the upper Niagara and Ontario regions in the late 1670s. In 1679, La Salle&#x27;s ship, Le Griffon, became the first to sail above Niagara Falls near Cayuga Creek. Baron de Lahontan visited the site of Buffalo in 1687. A small French settlement along Buffalo Creek lasted for only a year (1758). After the French and Indian War, the region was ruled by Britain. After the American Revolution, the Province of New York—now a U.S. state—began westward expansion, looking for arable land by following the Iroquois.

New York and Massachusetts were vying for the territory which included Buffalo, and Massachusetts had the right to purchase all but a one-mile-(1600-meter)-wide portion of land. The rights to the Massachusetts territories were sold to Robert Morris in 1791. Despite objections from Seneca chief Red Jacket, Morris brokered a deal between fellow chief Cornplanter and the Dutch dummy corporation Holland Land Company. The Holland Land Purchase gave the Senecas three reservations, and the Holland Land Company received for about thirty-three cents per acre.
Permanent white settlers along the creek were prisoners captured during the Revolutionary War. Early landowners were Iroquois interpreter Captain William Johnston, former enslaved man Joseph &quot;Black Joe&quot; Hodges and Cornelius Winney, a Dutch trader who arrived in 1789. As a result of the war, in which the Iroquois sided with the British Army, Iroquois territory was gradually reduced in the late 1700s by European settlers through successive statewide treaties which included the Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1784) and the First Treaty of Buffalo Creek (1788). The Iroquois were moved onto reservations, including Buffalo Creek. By the end of the 18th century, only of reservations remained.

After the Treaty of Big Tree removed Iroquois title to lands west of the Genesee River in 1797, Joseph Ellicott surveyed land at the mouth of Buffalo Creek. In the middle of the village was an intersection of eight streets at present-day Niagara Square. Originally named New Amsterdam, its name was soon changed to Buffalo.

=== Erie Canal, grain and commerce ===

The village of Buffalo was named for Buffalo Creek. British military engineer John Montresor referred to &quot;Buffalo Creek&quot; in his 1764 journal, the earliest recorded appearance of the name. A road to Pennsylvania from Buffalo was built in 1802 for migrants traveling to the Connecticut Western Reserve in Ohio. Before an east–west turnpike across the state was completed, traveling from Albany to Buffalo would take a week; a trip from nearby Williamsville to Batavia could take over three days.

British forces burned Buffalo and the northwestern village of Black Rock in 1813. The battle and subsequent fire was in response to the destruction of Niagara-on-the-Lake by American forces and other skirmishes during the War of 1812. Rebuilding was swift, completed in 1815. As a remote outpost, village residents hoped that the proposed Erie Canal would bring prosperity to the area. To accomplish this, Buffalo&#x27;s harbor was expanded with the help of Samuel Wilkeson; it was selected as the canal&#x27;s terminus over the rival Black Rock. It opened in 1825, ushering in commerce, manufacturing and hydropower. By the following year, the Buffalo Creek Reservation (at the western border of the village) was transferred to Buffalo. Buffalo was incorporated as a city in 1832. During the 1830s, businessman Benjamin Rathbun significantly expanded its business district. The city doubled in size from 1845 to 1855. Almost two-thirds of the city&#x27;s population was foreign-born, largely a mix of unskilled (or educated) Irish and German Catholics.

Fugitive slaves made their way north to Buffalo during the 1840s. Buffalo was a terminus of the Underground Railroad, with many free Black people crossing the Niagara River to Fort Erie, Ontario; others remained in Buffalo. During this time, Buffalo&#x27;s port continued to develop. Passenger and commercial traffic expanded, leading to the creation of feeder canals and the expansion of the city&#x27;s harbor. Unloading grain in Buffalo was a laborious job, and grain handlers working on lake freighters would make $1.50 a day () in a six-day work week. Local inventor Joseph Dart and engineer Robert Dunbar created the grain elevator in 1843, adapting the steam-powered elevator. Dart&#x27;s Elevator initially processed one thousand bushels per hour, speeding global distribution to consumers. Buffalo was the transshipment hub of the Great Lakes, and weather, maritime and political events in other Great Lakes cities had a direct impact on the city&#x27;s economy. In addition to grain, Buffalo&#x27;s primary imports included agricultural products from the Midwest (meat, whiskey, lumber and tobacco), and its exports included leather, ships and iron products. The mid-19th century saw the rise of new manufacturing capabilities, particularly with iron.

By the 1860s, many railroads terminated in Buffalo; they included the Buffalo, Bradford and Pittsburgh Railroad, Buffalo and Erie Railroad, the New York Central Railroad, and the Lehigh Valley Railroad. During this time, Buffalo controlled one-quarter of all shipping traffic on Lake Erie. After the Civil War, canal traffic began to drop as railroads expanded into Buffalo. Unionization began to take hold in the late 19th century, highlighted by the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 and 1892 Buffalo switchmen&#x27;s strike.

=== Steel, challenges, and the modern era ===
At the start of the 20th century, Buffalo was the world&#x27;s leading grain port and a national flour-milling hub. Local mills were among the first to benefit from hydroelectricity generated by the Niagara River. Buffalo hosted the 1901 Pan-American Exposition after the Spanish–American War, showcasing the nation&#x27;s advances in art, architecture, and electricity. Its centerpiece was the Electric Tower, with over two million light bulbs, but some exhibits were jingoistic and racially charged. At the exposition, President William McKinley was assassinated by anarchist Leon Czolgosz. When McKinley died, Theodore Roosevelt was sworn in at the Wilcox Mansion in Buffalo.

Attorney John Milburn and local industrialists convinced the Lackawanna Iron and Steel Company to relocate from Scranton, Pennsylvania to the town of West Seneca in 1904. Employment was competitive, with many Eastern Europeans and Scrantonians vying for jobs. From the late 19th century to the 1920s, mergers and acquisitions led to distant ownership of local companies; this had a negative effect on the city&#x27;s economy. Examples include the acquisition of Lackawanna Steel by Bethlehem Steel and, later, the relocation of Curtiss-Wright in the 1940s. The Great Depression saw severe unemployment, especially among the working class. New Deal relief programs operated in full force, and the city became a stronghold of labor unions and the Democratic Party.
During World War II, Buffalo regained its manufacturing strength as military contracts enabled the city to manufacture steel, chemicals, aircraft, trucks and ammunition. The 15th-most-populous US city in 1950, Buffalo&#x27;s economy relied almost entirely on manufacturing; eighty percent of area jobs were in the sector. The city also had over a dozen railway terminals, as railroads remained a significant industry.

The St. Lawrence Seaway was proposed in the 19th century as a faster shipping route to Europe, and later as part of a bi-national hydroelectric project with Canada. Its combination with an expanded Welland Canal led to a grim outlook for Buffalo&#x27;s economy. After its 1959 opening, the city&#x27;s port and barge canal became largely irrelevant. Shipbuilding in Buffalo wound down in the 1960s due to reduced waterfront activity, ending an industry which had been part of the city&#x27;s economy since 1812. Downsizing of the steel mills was attributed to the threat of higher wages and unionization efforts. Racial tensions culminated in riots in 1967. Suburbanization led to the selection of the town of Amherst for the new University at Buffalo campus by 1970. Unwilling to modernize its plant, Bethlehem Steel began cutting thousands of jobs in Lackawanna during the mid-1970s before closing it in 1983. The region lost at least 70,000 jobs between 1970 and 1984. Like much of the Rust Belt, Buffalo has focused on recovering from the effects of late-20th-century deindustrialization.
==Geography==
=== Topography ===

Buffalo is on the eastern end of Lake Erie opposite Fort Erie, Ontario. It is at the head of the Niagara River, which flows north over Niagara Falls into Lake Ontario.

The Buffalo metropolitan area is on the Erie/Ontario Lake Plain of the Eastern Great Lakes Lowlands, a narrow plain extending east to Utica, New York. The city is generally flat, except for elevation changes in the University Heights and Fruit Belt neighborhoods. The Southtowns are hillier, leading to the Cattaraugus Hills in the Appalachian Upland. Several types of shale, limestone and lagerstätten are prevalent in Buffalo and its surrounding area, lining their stream beds.

According to Fox Weather, Buffalo is one of the top five snowiest large cities in the country, receiving, on average, 95 inches of snow annually.

Although the city has not experienced any recent or significant earthquakes, Buffalo is in the Southern Great Lakes Seismic Zone (part of the Great Lakes tectonic zone). Buffalo has four channels within its boundaries: the Niagara River, Buffalo River (and Creek), Scajaquada Creek, and the Black Rock Canal, adjacent to the Niagara River. The city&#x27;s Bureau of Forestry maintains a database of over seventy thousand trees.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Buffalo has an area of ; is land, and the rest is water. The city&#x27;s total area is 22.66 percent water. In 2010, its population density was 6,470.6 per square mile.

===Cityscape===
Buffalo&#x27;s architecture is diverse, with a collection of 19th- and 20th-century buildings. Downtown Buffalo landmarks include Louis Sullivan&#x27;s Guaranty Building, an early skyscraper; the Ellicott Square Building, once one of the largest of its kind in the world; the Art Deco Buffalo City Hall and the McKinley Monument, and the Electric Tower. Beyond downtown, the Buffalo Central Terminal was built in the Broadway-Fillmore neighborhood in 1929; the Richardson Olmsted Complex, built in 1881, was an insane asylum until its closure in the 1970s. Urban renewal from the 1950s to the 1970s spawned the Brutalist-style Buffalo City Court Building and Seneca One Tower, the city&#x27;s tallest building. In the city&#x27;s Parkside neighborhood, the Darwin D. Martin House was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in his Prairie School style.
Since 2016, Washington DC real estate developer Douglas Jemal has been acquiring, and redeveloping, iconic properties throughout the city.

===Neighborhoods===

According to Mark Goldman, the city has a &quot;tradition of separate and independent settlements&quot;. The boundaries of Buffalo&#x27;s neighborhoods have changed over time. The city is divided into five districts, each containing several neighborhoods, for a total of thirty-five neighborhoods. Main Street divides Buffalo&#x27;s east and west sides, and the west side was fully developed earlier. This division is seen in architectural styles, street names, neighborhood and district boundaries, demographics, and socioeconomic conditions; Buffalo&#x27;s West Side is generally more affluent than its East Side.

Several neighborhoods in Buffalo have had increased investment since the 1990s, beginning with the Elmwood Village. The 2002 redevelopment of the Larkin Terminal Warehouse led to the creation of Larkinville, home to several mixed-use projects and anchored by corporate offices. Downtown Buffalo and its central business district (CBD) had a 10.6-percent increase in residents from 2010 to 2017, as over 1,061 housing units became available; the Seneca One Tower was redeveloped in 2020. Other revitalized areas include Chandler Street, in the Grant-Amherst neighborhood, and Hertel Avenue in Parkside.

The Buffalo Common Council adopted its Green Code in 2017, replacing zoning regulations which were over sixty years old. Its emphasis on regulations promoting pedestrian safety and mixed land use received an award at the 2019 Congress for the New Urbanism conference.

===Climate===

Buffalo has a humid continental climate (Köppen: Dfa), and temperatures have been warming with the rest of the US. Lake-effect snow is characteristic of Buffalo winters, with snow bands (producing intense snowfall in the city and surrounding area) depending on wind direction off Lake Erie. However, Buffalo is rarely the snowiest city in the state. The Blizzard of 1977 resulted from a combination of high winds and snow which accumulated on land and on the frozen Lake Erie. Although snow does not typically impair the city&#x27;s operation, it can cause significant damage in autumn (as the October 2006 storm did). In November 2014 (called &quot;Snowvember&quot;), the region had a record-breaking storm which produced over of snow. Buffalo&#x27;s lowest recorded temperature was , which occurred twice: on February 9, 1934, and February 2, 1961.

Although the city&#x27;s summers are drier and sunnier than other cities in the northeastern United States, its vegetation receives enough precipitation to remain hydrated. Buffalo summers are characterized by abundant sunshine, with moderate humidity and temperatures; the city benefits from cool, southwestern Lake Erie summer breezes which temper warmer temperatures. Temperatures rise above an average of three times a year. No official recording of or more has occurred to date, with a maximum temperature of reached on August 27, 1948. Rainfall is moderate, typically falling at night, and cooler lake temperatures hinder storm development in July. August is usually rainier and , as the warmer lake loses its temperature-controlling ability.

==Demographics==



Several hundred Seneca, Tuscarora and other Iroquois tribal peoples were the primary residents of the Buffalo area before 1800, concentrated along Buffalo Creek. After the Revolutionary War, settlers from New England and eastern New York began to move into the area.

From the 1830s to the 1850s, they were joined by Irish and German immigrants from Europe, both peasants and working class, who settled in enclaves on the city&#x27;s south and east sides. At the turn of the 20th century, Polish immigrants replaced Germans on the East Side, who moved to newer housing; Italian immigrant families settled throughout the city, primarily on the lower West Side.

During the 1830s, Buffalo residents were generally intolerant of the small groups of Black Americans who began settling on the city&#x27;s East Side. In the 20th century, wartime and manufacturing jobs attracted Black Americans from the South during the First and Second Great Migrations. In the World War II and postwar years from 1940 to 1970, the city&#x27;s Black population rose by 433 percent. They replaced most of the Polish community on the East Side, who were moving out to suburbs. However, the effects of redlining, steering, social inequality, blockbusting, white flight and other racial policies resulted in the city (and region) becoming one of the most segregated in the U.S.

During the 1940s and 1950s, Puerto Rican migrants arrived en masse, also seeking industrial jobs, settling on the East Side and moving westward. In the 21st century, Buffalo is classified as a majority minority city, with a plurality of residents who are Black and Latino.

Buffalo has experienced effects of urban decay since the 1970s, and also saw population loss to the suburbs and Sun Belt states, and experienced job losses from deindustrialization. The city&#x27;s population peaked at 580,132 in 1950, when Buffalo was the 15th-largest city in the United Statesdown from the eighth-largest city in 1900, after its growth rate slowed during the 1920s. Buffalo finally saw a population gain of 6.5% in the 2020 census, reversing a decades long trend of population decline. The city has 278,349 residents as of the 2020 census, making it the 76th-most populous city in the United States. Its metropolitan area had 1.1 million residents in 2020, the country&#x27;s 49th-largest.

Compared to other major US metropolitan areas, the number of foreign-born immigrants to Buffalo is low. New immigrants are primarily resettled refugees (especially from war- or disaster-affected nations) and refugees who had previously settled in other U.S. cities. During the early 2000s, most immigrants came from Canada and Yemen; this shifted in the 2010s to Burmese (Karen) refugees and Bangladeshi immigrants. Between 2008 and 2016, Burmese, Somali, Bhutanese, and Iraqi Americans were the four largest ethnic immigrant groups in Erie County.

A 2008 report noted that although food deserts were seen in larger cities and not in Buffalo, the city&#x27;s neighborhoods of color have access only to smaller grocery stores and lack the supermarkets more typical of newer, white neighborhoods. A 2018 report noted that over fifty city blocks on Buffalo&#x27;s East Side lacked adequate access to a supermarket.

Health disparities exist compared to the rest of the state: Erie County&#x27;s average 2019 lifespan was three years lower (78.4 years); its 17-percent smoking and 30-percent obesity rates were slightly higher than the state average. According to the Partnership for the Public Good, educational achievement in the city is lower than in the surrounding area; city residents are almost twice as likely as adults in the metropolitan area to lack a high-school diploma.

===Religion===

During the early 19th century, Presbyterian missionaries tried to convert the Seneca people on the Buffalo Creek Reservation to Christianity. Initially resistant, some tribal members set aside their traditions and practices to form their own sect. Later, European immigrants added other faiths. Christianity is the predominant religion in Buffalo and Western New York. Catholicism (primarily the Latin Church) has a significant presence in the region, with 161 parishes and over 570,000 adherents in the Diocese of Buffalo. 

A Jewish community began developing in the city with immigrants from the mid-1800s; about one thousand German and Lithuanian Jews settled in Buffalo before 1880. Buffalo&#x27;s first synagogue, Temple Beth El, was established in 1847. The city&#x27;s Temple Beth Zion is the region&#x27;s largest synagogue.

With changing demographics and an increased number of refugees from other areas on the city&#x27;s East Side, Islam and Buddhism have expanded their presence. In this area, new residents have converted empty churches into mosques and Buddhist temples. Hinduism maintains a small, active presence in the area, including the town of Amherst.

A 2016 American Bible Society survey reported that Buffalo is the fifth-least &quot;Bible-minded&quot; city in the United States; 13 percent of its residents associate with the Bible.

==Economy==

The Erie Canal was the impetus for Buffalo&#x27;s economic growth as a transshipment hub for grain and other agricultural products headed east from the Midwest. Later, manufacturing of steel and automotive parts became central to the city&#x27;s economy. When these industries downsized in the region, Buffalo&#x27;s economy became service-based. Its primary sectors include health care, business services (banking, accounting, and insurance), retail, tourism and logistics, especially with Canada. Despite the loss of large-scale manufacturing, some manufacturing of metals, chemicals, machinery, food products, and electronics remains in the region. Advanced manufacturing has increased, with an emphasis on research and development (R&amp;D) and automation. In 2019, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis valued the gross domestic product (GDP) of the Buffalo–Niagara Falls MSA at $53 billion (~$ in ).

The civic sector is a major source of employment in the Buffalo area, and includes public, non-profit, healthcare and educational institutions. New York State, with over 19,000 employees, is the region&#x27;s largest employer. In the private sector, top employers include the Kaleida Health and Catholic Health hospital networks and M&amp;T Bank, the sole Fortune 500 company headquartered in the city. Most have been the top employers in the region for several decades. Buffalo is home to the headquarters of Rich Products, Delaware North and New Era Cap Company; the aerospace manufacturer Moog Inc. and toy maker Fisher-Price are based in nearby East Aurora. National Fuel Gas and Life Storage are headquartered in Williamsville, New York.

Buffalo weathered the Great Recession of 2006–09 well in comparison with other U.S. cities, exemplified by increased home prices during this time. The region&#x27;s economy began to improve in the early 2010s, adding over 25,000 jobs from 2009 to 2017. With state aid, Tesla, Inc.&#x27;s Giga New York plant opened in South Buffalo in 2017. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, however, increased the local unemployment rate to 7.5 percent by December 2020. The local unemployment rate had been 4.2 percent in 2019, higher than the national average of 3.5 percent.

==Culture==
===Performing arts and music===
Buffalo is home to over 20 theater companies, with many centered in the downtown Theatre District. Shea&#x27;s Performing Arts Center is the city&#x27;s largest theater. Designed by Louis Comfort Tiffany and built in 1926, the theater presents Broadway musicals and concerts. Shakespeare in Delaware Park has been held outdoors every summer since 1976.

Stand-up comedy can be found throughout the city and is anchored by Helium Comedy Club, which hosts both local talent and national touring acts.

The Nickel City Opera is a small opera company based in Buffalo and in Palm Springs, California. It was founded in 2004 by Valerian Ruminski and composer Persis Vehar, and operated between 2009 and 2024. 

The NCO occasionally collaborates with the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra and other local organizations, producing a wide range of operas, from the 18th-century Baroque to contemporary. 

Shea&#x27;s Performing Arts Center was designed by the well-known Chicago firm Rapp and Rapp. The opera house was modeled in the style of European operahouses and decorated in a combination of French and Spanish Baroque and Rococo styles. The interior design was designed by the designer and artist Louis Comfort Tiffany, and many of its elements are still there today. Originally there were nearly 4,000 seats, but in the 1930s the number of seats was reduced to the current number of 3,019 seats last but not least to increase the place for the orchestra by increasing the size of the orchestra pit.
The Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra was formed in 1935 and performs at Kleinhans Music Hall, whose acoustics have been praised. Although the orchestra nearly disbanded during the late 1990s due to a lack of funding, philanthropic contributions and state aid stabilized it. Under the direction of JoAnn Falletta, the orchestra has received a number of Grammy Award nominations and won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Classical Composition in 2009.

KeyBank Center draws national music acts year-round. Sahlen Field hosts the annual WYRK Taste of Country music festival every summer with national country music acts. Canalside regularly hosts outdoor summer concerts, a tradition that spun off from the defunct Thursday at the Square concert series. Colored Musicians Club, an extension of what was a separate musicians&#x27;-union chapter, maintains jazz history.

Rick James was born and raised in Buffalo and later lived on a ranch in the nearby Town of Aurora. James formed his Stone City Band in Buffalo, and had national appeal with several crossover singles in the R&amp;B, disco and funk genres in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Around the same time, the jazz fusion band Spyro Gyra and jazz saxophonist Grover Washington Jr. also got their start in the city.

The Goo Goo Dolls, an alternative rock group which formed in 1986, had 19 top-ten singles. Singer-songwriter and activist Ani DiFranco has released over 20 folk and indie rock albums on Righteous Babe Records, her Buffalo-based label.

Underground hip-hop acts in the city partner with Buffalo-based Griselda Records, whose artists include Westside Gunn, Conway the Machine, and Benny the Butcher, who all occasionally refer to Buffalo culture in their lyrics.

=== Cuisine ===

The city&#x27;s cuisine encompasses a variety of cultures and ethnicities. In 2015, the National Geographic Society ranked Buffalo third on its &quot;World&#x27;s Top Ten Food Cities&quot; list. Teressa Bellissimo first prepared Buffalo wings (seasoned chicken wings) at the Anchor Bar in 1964. The Anchor Bar has a crosstown rivalry with Duff&#x27;s Famous Wings, but Buffalo wings are served at many bars and restaurants throughout the city (some with unique cooking styles and flavor profiles). Buffalo wings are traditionally served with blue cheese dressing and celery. In 2003, the Anchor Bar received a James Beard Foundation Award in the America&#x27;s Classics category.

The Buffalo area has over 600 pizzerias, estimated at more per capita than New York City. Several craft breweries began opening in the 1990s, and the city&#x27;s last call is 4 am. Other mainstays of Buffalo cuisine include beef on weck, butter lambs, kielbasa, pierogi, sponge candy, chicken finger subs (including the stinger - a version that also includes steak), and the fish fry (popular any time of year, but especially during Lent). With an influx of refugees and other immigrants to Buffalo, its number of ethnic restaurants (including the West Side Bazaar kitchen incubator) has increased. Some restaurants use food trucks to serve customers, and nearly fifty food trucks appeared at Larkin Square in 2019.

===Museums and tourism===
Buffalo was ranked the seventh-best city in the United States to visit in 2021 by &quot;Travel + Leisure&quot;, which noted the growth and potential of the city&#x27;s cultural institutions. The Albright–Knox Art Gallery is a modern and contemporary art museum with a collection of more than 8,000 works, of which only two percent are on display. With a donation from Jeffrey Gundlach, a three-story addition designed by the Dutch architectural firm OMA opened June 2023 . Across the street, the Burchfield Penney Art Center contains paintings by Charles E. Burchfield and is operated by Buffalo State College. Buffalo is home to the Freedom Wall, a 2017 art installation commemorating civil-rights activists throughout history. Near both museums is the Buffalo History Museum, featuring artwork, literature and exhibits related to the city&#x27;s history and major events, and the Buffalo Museum of Science is on the city&#x27;s East Side.

Canalside, Buffalo&#x27;s historic business district and harbor, attracts more than 1.5 million visitors annually. It includes the Explore &amp; More Children&#x27;s Museum, the Buffalo and Erie County Naval &amp; Military Park, LECOM Harborcenter, and a number of shops and restaurants. A restored 1924 carousel (now solar-powered) and a replica boathouse were added to Canalside in 2021. Other city attractions include the Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic Site, the Michigan Street Baptist Church, Buffalo RiverWorks, Seneca Buffalo Creek Casino, Buffalo Transportation Pierce-Arrow Museum, and the Nash House Museum.

The National Buffalo Wing Festival is held every Labor Day at Sahlen Field. Since 2002, it has served over 4.8 million Buffalo wings and has had a total attendance of 865,000. The Taste of Buffalo is a two-day food festival held in July at Niagara Square, attracting 450,000 visitors annually. Other events include the Allentown Art Festival, the Polish-American Dyngus Day, the Elmwood Avenue Festival of the Arts, Juneteenth in Martin Luther King Jr. Park, the World&#x27;s Largest Disco in October and Friendship Festival in summer, which celebrates Canada-US relations.

==Sports==

Buffalo has two major professional sports teams: the Buffalo Sabres (National Hockey League) and the Buffalo Bills (National Football League). The Bills were a founding member of the American Football League in 1960, and have played at Highmark Stadium in Orchard Park since they moved from War Memorial Stadium in 1973. They are the only NFL team based in New York State. Before the Super Bowl era, the Bills won the American Football League Championship in 1964 and 1965. With mixed success throughout their history, the Bills had a close loss in Super Bowl XXV and returned to consecutive Super Bowls after the 1991, 1992, and 1993 seasons (losing each time). The Sabres, an expansion team in 1970, share KeyBank Center with the Buffalo Bandits of the National Lacrosse League. The Bandits are the most decorated of the city&#x27;s professional teams, with six championships. The Bills, Sabres and Bandits are owned by Pegula Sports and Entertainment.

Several colleges and universities in the area field intercollegiate sports teams; the Buffalo Bulls and the Canisius Golden Griffins compete in NCAA Division I. The Bulls have 16 varsity sports in the Mid-American Conference (MAC); the Golden Griffins field 15 teams in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC), with the men&#x27;s hockey team part of the Atlantic Hockey Association (AHA). The Bulls participate in the Football Bowl Subdivision, the highest level of college football. Buffalo&#x27;s minor-league teams include the Buffalo Bisons (Triple-A baseball), who play at Sahlen Field, and the Buffalo eXtreme (American Basketball Association), who play at XGen Elite Sports Complex in West Seneca.

==Parks and recreation==

Frederick Law Olmsted described Buffalo as being &quot;the best planned city [...] in the United States, if not the world&quot;. With encouragement from city stakeholders, he and Calvert Vaux augmented the city&#x27;s grid plan by drawing inspiration from Paris and introducing landscape architecture with aspects of the countryside. Their plan would introduce a system of interconnected parks, parkways and trails, unlike the singular Central Park in New York City. The largest would be Delaware Park, across Forest Lawn Cemetery to amplify the amount of open space. With construction of the system finishing in 1876, it is regarded as the country&#x27;s oldest; however, some of Olmsted&#x27;s plans were never fully realized. Some parks later diminished and succumbed to diseases, highway construction, and weather events such as Lake Storm Aphid in 2006. The non-profit Buffalo Olmsted Park Conservancy was created in 2004 to help preserve the of parkland. Olmsted&#x27;s work in Buffalo inspired similar efforts in cities such as San Francisco, Chicago, and Boston.
The city&#x27;s Division of Parks and Recreation manages over 180 parks and facilities, seven recreational centers, twenty-one pools and splash pads, and three ice rinks. The Delaware Park features the Buffalo Zoo, Hoyt Lake, a golf course, and playing fields. Buffalo collaborated with its sister city Kanazawa to create the park&#x27;s Japanese Garden in 1970, where cherry blossoms bloom in the spring. Opening in 1976, Tifft Nature Preserve in South Buffalo is on of remediated industrial land. The preserve is an Important Bird Area, including a meadow with trails for hiking and cross-country skiing, marshland and fishing. The Olmsted-designed Cazenovia and South Parks, the latter home to the Buffalo and Erie County Botanical Gardens, are also in South Buffalo. According to the Trust for Public Land, Buffalo&#x27;s 2022 ParkScore ranking had high marks for access to parks, with 89 percent of city residents living within a ten-minute walk from a park. The city ranked lower in acreage, however; nine percent of city land is devoted to parks, compared with the national median of about fifteen percent.

Efforts to convert Buffalo&#x27;s former industrial waterfront into recreational space have attracted national attention, with some writers comparing its appeal to that of Niagara Falls. Redevelopment of the waterfront began in the early 2000s, with the reconstruction of historically aligned canals on the site of the former Buffalo Memorial Auditorium. Placemaking initiatives would lead to the area&#x27;s popularity, rather than permanent buildings and attractions. Under Mayor Byron Brown, Canalside was cited by the Brookings Institution as an example of waterfront revitalization for other U.S. cities to follow. Summer events have included paddle-boating and fitness classes, and the frozen canals permit ice skating, curling, and ice cycling in winter. Its success spurred the state to create Buffalo Harbor State Park in 2014; the park has trails, open recreation areas, bicycle paths and piers. The park&#x27;s Gallagher Beach, the city&#x27;s only public beach, has prohibited swimming due to high bacteria levels and other environmental concerns.

The Shoreline Trail passes through Buffalo near the Outer Harbor, Centennial Park, and the Black Rock Canal. The North Buffalo–Tonawanda rail trail begins in Shoshone Park, near the LaSalle metro station in North Buffalo.

==Government==

Buffalo has a Strong mayor–council government. As the chief executive of city government, the mayor oversees the heads of the city&#x27;s departments, participates in ceremonies, boards and commissions, and is as the liaison between the city and local cultural institutions. Some agencies, including utilities, urban renewal and public housing, are state- and federally-funded public benefit-corporations semi-independent of city government. Christopher Scanlon has served as acting mayor since 2024, following the resignation of Byron Brown. No Republican has been mayor of Buffalo since Chester A. Kowal in 1965.

With its nine districts, the Buffalo Common Council enacts laws, levies taxes, and approves mayoral appointees and the city budget. Bryan Bollman has been the Common Council president since 2024. Generally reflecting the city&#x27;s electorate, all nine councilmen are members of the Democratic Party. Buffalo is the Erie County seat, and is within five of the county&#x27;s eleven legislative districts.

The city is part of the Eighth Judicial District. Court cases handled at the city level include misdemeanors, violations, housing matters, and claims under $15,000; more severe cases are handled at the county level. Buffalo is represented by members of the New York State Assembly and New York State Senate. At the federal level, the city takes up most of and has been represented by Democrat Tim Kennedy since 2024.

Federal offices in the city include the Buffalo District of the United States Army Corps of Engineers&#x27; Great Lakes and Ohio River Division, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the United States District Court for the Western District of New York.

In 2020, the city spent $519 million (~$ in ) on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The city in 2024 is hampered with a severe budget deficit attributed to the Byron Brown administration.

=== Public safety ===
Buffalo is served by the Buffalo Police Department. The police commissioner is Byron Lockwood, who was appointed by Mayor Byron Brown in 2018. Although some criminal activity in the city remains higher than the national average, total crimes have decreased since the 1990s; one reason may be the gun buyback program implemented by the Brown administration in the mid-2000s. Before this, the city was part of the nationwide crack epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s and its accompanying record-high crime levels. In 2018, city police began wearing 300 body cameras. A 2021 Partnership for the Public Good report noted that the BPD, which had a 2020–21 budget of about $145.7 million, had an above-average police-to-citizen ratio of 28.9 officers per 10,000 residents in 2020higher than peer cities Minneapolis and Toledo, Ohio. The force had a roster of 740 officers during the year, about two-thirds of whom handled emergency requests, road patrol and other non-office assignments. The department has been criticized for misconduct and brutality, including the 2004 wrongful termination of officer Cariol Horne for opposing police brutality toward a suspect and a 2020 protest-shoving incident.

The Buffalo Fire Department and American Medical Response (AMR) handle fire-protection and emergency medical services (EMS) calls in the city. The fire department has about 710 firefighters and thirty-five stations, including twenty-three engine companies and twelve ladder companies. The department also operates the &quot;Edward M. Cotter&quot;, considered the world&#x27;s oldest active fireboat.

With vacant and abandoned homes prone to arson, squatting, prostitution and other criminal activities, the fire and police department&#x27;s resources were overburdened before the 2010s. Buffalo ranked second nationwide to St. Louis for vacant homes per capita in 2007, and the city began a five-year program to demolish five thousand vacant, damaged and abandoned homes. On May 14, 2022, there was a mass shooting in a Tops supermarket on the East Side of Buffalo where 13 victims were shot in a racially motivated attack by a white supremacist who was not a Buffalo native. Ten victims, all of whom were black, were murdered and three were injured.

==Media==
Buffalo&#x27;s major daily newspaper is &quot;The Buffalo News.&quot; Established in 1880 as the &quot;Buffalo Evening News,&quot; the newspaper is estimated to have a daily circulation of 35,000 (down from a high of 310,000). The newspaper announced a pending sale of its building in February 2023, and the relocation of its printing operations to Cleveland, Ohio. Other newspapers in the Buffalo area include the Black-focused &quot;Buffalo Criterion&quot; and &quot;Challenger Community News,&quot; &quot;The Record&quot; of Buffalo State University, &quot;The Spectrum&quot; of the University at Buffalo, and &quot;Buffalo Business First.&quot; &quot;Investigative Post&quot; is an online watchdog news organization founded by former &quot;Buffalo News&quot; reporter and Pulitzer nominee Jim Heaney.

Eighteen radio stations are licensed in Buffalo, including an FM station at Buffalo State College. Over ninety FM and AM radio signals can be received throughout the city. Eight full-power television outlets serve the city. Major commercial stations include WGRZ 2 (NBC), WIVB-TV 4 (CBS) and its sister station WNLO 23 (CW O&amp;O), WKBW-TV 7 (ABC), and WUTV 29 (Fox, received in parts of Southern Ontario) and its sister station WNYO-TV 49 (MyNetworkTV). Buffalo&#x27;s public television station is WNED-TV 17 (PBS); WNED has reported that most of the station&#x27;s members live in the Greater Toronto Area. According to Nielsen Media Research, the Buffalo television market was the 51st largest in the United States . 

Movies shooting significant footage in Buffalo include &quot;Hide in Plain Sight&quot; (1980), &quot;Tuck Everlasting&quot; (1981), &quot;Best Friends&quot; (1982), &quot;The Natural&quot; (1984), &quot;Vamping&quot; (1984), &quot;Canadian Bacon&quot; (1995), &quot;Buffalo &#x27;66&quot; (1998), &quot;Manna from Heaven&quot; (2002), &quot;Bruce Almighty &quot;(2003), &quot;The Savages&quot; (2007), Slime City Massacre (2010), &quot;Henry&#x27;s Crime&quot; (2011), &quot;Sharknado 2: The Second One&quot; (2014), &quot;Killer Rack (2015), Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows&quot; (2016), &quot;Marshall&quot; (2016), &quot;The American Side&quot; (2017), &quot;The First Purge&quot; (2018), &quot;The True Adventures of Wolfboy&quot; (2019) and &quot;A Quiet Place Part II&quot; (2021). Although higher Buffalo production costs led to some films being finished elsewhere, tax credits and other economic incentives have enabled new film studios and production facilities to open. In 2021, several studio projects were in the planning stages.

==Education==
=== Primary and secondary education ===

The Buffalo Public Schools have about thirty-four thousand students enrolled in their primary and secondary schools. The district administers about sixty public schools, including thirty-six primary schools, five middle high schools, fourteen high schools and three alternative schools, with a total of about 3,500 teachers. Its board of education, authorized by the state, has nine elected members who select the superintendent and oversee the budget, curriculum, personnel, and facilities. In 2020, the graduation rate was seventy-six percent. The public City Honors School was ranked the top high school in the city and 178th nationwide by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; in 2021. There are twenty charter schools in Buffalo, with some oversight by the district. The city has over a dozen private schools, including Bishop Timon – St. Jude High School, Canisius High School, Mount Mercy Academy, and Nardin Academy—all Roman Catholic, and Darul Uloom Al-Madania and Universal School of Buffalo (both Islamic schools); nonsectarian options include Buffalo Seminary and the Nichols School.

=== Colleges and universities ===
Founded by Millard Fillmore, the University at Buffalo (UB) is one of the State University of New York&#x27;s two flagship universities and the state&#x27;s largest public university. A Research I university, over 32,000 undergraduate, graduate and professional students attend its thirteen schools and colleges. Two of UB&#x27;s three campuses (the South and Downtown Campuses) are in the city, but most university functions take place at the large North Campus in Amherst. In 2020, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked UB the 34th-best public university and 88th in national universities. Buffalo State College, founded as a normal school, is one of SUNY&#x27;s thirteen comprehensive colleges. The city&#x27;s four-year private institutions include Canisius University, D&#x27;Youville University, Trocaire College, and Villa Maria College. SUNY Erie, the county&#x27;s two-year public higher-education institution, and the for-profit Bryant &amp; Stratton College have small downtown campuses.

=== Libraries ===

Established in 1835, Buffalo&#x27;s main library is the Central Library of the Buffalo &amp; Erie County Public Library system. Rebuilt in 1964, it contains an auditorium, the original manuscript of the &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; (donated by Mark Twain), and a collection of about two million books. Its Grosvenor Room maintains a special-collections listing of nearly five hundred thousand resources for researchers. A pocket park funded by Southwest Airlines opened in 2020, and brought landscaping improvements and seating to Lafayette Square. The system&#x27;s free library cards are valid at the city&#x27;s eight branch libraries and at member libraries throughout Erie County.

==Infrastructure==
===Healthcare===
Nine hospitals are operated in the city: Oishei Children&#x27;s Hospital and Buffalo General Medical Center by Kaleida Health, Mercy Hospital and Sisters of Charity Hospital (Catholic Health), Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, the county-run Erie County Medical Center (ECMC), Buffalo VA Medical Center, BryLin (Psychiatric) Hospital and the state-operated Buffalo Psychiatric Center. John R. Oishei Children&#x27;s Hospital, built in 2017, is adjacent to Buffalo General Medical Center on the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus north of downtown; its Gates Vascular Institute specializes in acute stroke recovery. The medical campus includes the University at Buffalo Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, the Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute and Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, ranked the 14th-best cancer-treatment center in the United States by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.

===Transportation===

Growth and changing transportation needs altered Buffalo&#x27;s grid plan, which was developed by Joseph Ellicott in 1804. His plan laid out streets like the spokes of a wheel, naming them after Dutch landowners and Native American tribes. City streets expanded outward, denser in the west and spreading out east of Main Street. Buffalo is a port of entry with Canada; the Peace Bridge crosses the Niagara River and links the Niagara Thruway (I-190) and Queen Elizabeth Way. I-190, NY 5 and NY 33 are the primary expressways serving the city, carrying a total of over 245,000 vehicles daily. NY 5 carries traffic to the Southtowns, and NY 33 carries traffic to the eastern suburbs and the Buffalo Airport. The east-west Scajacquada Expressway (NY 198) bisects Delaware Park, connecting I-190 with the Kensington Expressway (NY 33) on the city&#x27;s East Side to form a partial beltway around the city center. The Scajacquada and Kensington Expressways and the Buffalo Skyway (NY 5) have been targeted for redesign or removal. Other major highways include US 62 on the city&#x27;s East Side; NY 354 and a portion of NY 130, both east–west routes; and NY 265, NY 266 and NY 384, all north–south routes on the city&#x27;s West Side. Buffalo has a higher-than-average percentage of households without a car: 30 percent in 2015, decreasing to 28.2 percent in 2016; the 2016 national average was 8.7 percent. Buffalo averaged 1.03 cars per household in 2016, compared to the national average of 1.8.

The Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority (NFTA) operates the region&#x27;s public transit, including its airport, light-rail system, buses, and harbors. The NFTA operates 323 buses on 61 lines throughout Western New York. Buffalo Metro Rail is a line which runs from Canalside to the University Heights district. The line&#x27;s downtown section, south of the Fountain Plaza station, runs at grade and is free of charge. The Buffalo area ranks twenty-third nationwide in transit ridership, with thirty trips per capita per year. Expansions have been proposed since Buffalo Metro Rail&#x27;s inception in the 1980s, with the latest plan (in the late 2010s) reaching the town of Amherst. Buffalo Niagara International Airport in Cheektowaga has daily scheduled flights by domestic, charter and regional carriers. The airport handled nearly five million passengers in 2019. It received a J.D. Power award in 2018 for customer satisfaction at a mid-sized airport, and underwent a $50 million expansion in 2020–21. The airport, light rail, small-boat harbor and buses are monitored by the NFTA&#x27;s transit police.

Buffalo has an Amtrak intercity train station, Buffalo–Exchange Street station, which was rebuilt in 2020. The city&#x27;s eastern suburbs are served by Amtrak&#x27;s Buffalo–Depew station in Depew, which was built in 1979. Buffalo was a major stop on through routes between Chicago and New York City through the lower Ontario Peninsula; trains stopped at Buffalo Central Terminal, which operated from 1929 to 1979. Intercity buses depart and arrive from the NFTA&#x27;s Metropolitan Transportation Center on Ellicott Street.

Since Buffalo adopted a complete streets policy in 2008, efforts have been made to accommodate cyclists and pedestrians into new infrastructure projects. Improved corridors have bike lanes, and Niagara Street received separate bike lanes in 2020. Walk Score gave Buffalo a &quot;somewhat walkable&quot; rating of 68 out of 100, with Allentown and downtown considered more walkable than other areas of the city.

===Utilities===
Buffalo&#x27;s water system is operated by Veolia Water, and water treatment begins at the Colonel Francis G. Ward Pumping Station. When it opened in 1915, the station&#x27;s capacity was second only to Paris. Wastewater is treated by the Buffalo Sewer Authority, its coverage extending to the eastern suburbs. National Grid and New York State Electric &amp; Gas (NYSEG) provide electricity, and National Fuel Gas provides natural gas. The city&#x27;s primary telecommunications provider is Spectrum; Verizon Fios serves the North Park neighborhood. A 2018 report by Ookla noted that Buffalo was one of the bottom five U.S. cities in average download speeds at 66 megabits per second.

The city&#x27;s Department of Public Works manages Buffalo&#x27;s snow and trash removal and street cleaning. Snow removal generally operates from November 15 to April 1. A snow emergency is declared by the National Weather Service after a snowstorm, and the city&#x27;s roads, major sidewalks and bridges are cleared by over seventy snowplows within 24 hours. Rock salt is the principal agent for preventing snow accumulation and melting ice. Snow removal may coincide with driving bans and parking restrictions. The area along the Outer Harbor is the most dangerous driving area during a snowstorm; when weather conditions dictate, the Buffalo Skyway is closed by the city&#x27;s police department.

To prevent ice jams which may impact hydroelectric plants in Niagara Falls, the New York Power Authority and Ontario Power Generation began installing an ice boom annually in 1964. The boom&#x27;s installation date is temperature-dependent, and it is removed on April 1 unless there is more than of ice remaining on eastern Lake Erie. It stretches from the outer breakwall at the Buffalo Outer Harbor to the Canadian shore near Fort Erie. Originally made of wood, the boom now consists of steel pontoons.

<doc id="3986" wikidata="Q34969" url="?curid=3986" title="Benjamin Franklin">
<text>Benjamin Franklin (April 17, 1790) was an American polymath: a writer, scientist, inventor, statesman, diplomat, printer, publisher and political philosopher. Among the most influential intellectuals of his time, Franklin was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States; a drafter and signer of the Declaration of Independence; and the first postmaster general.

Born in the Province of Massachusetts Bay, Franklin became a successful newspaper editor and printer in Philadelphia, the leading city in the colonies, publishing &quot;The Pennsylvania Gazette&quot; at age 23. He became wealthy publishing this and &quot;Poor Richard&#x27;s Almanack&quot;, which he wrote under the pseudonym &quot;Richard Saunders&quot;. After 1767, he was associated with the &quot;Pennsylvania Chronicle&quot;, a newspaper known for its revolutionary sentiments and criticisms of the policies of the British Parliament and the Crown. He pioneered and was the first president of the Academy and College of Philadelphia, which opened in 1751 and later became the University of Pennsylvania. He organized and was the first secretary of the American Philosophical Society and was elected its president in 1769. He was appointed deputy postmaster-general for the British colonies in 1753, which enabled him to set up the first national communications network.

Franklin was active in community affairs and colonial and state politics, as well as national and international affairs. He became a hero in America when, as an agent in London for several colonies, he spearheaded the repeal of the unpopular Stamp Act by the British Parliament. An accomplished diplomat, he was widely admired as the first U.S. ambassador to France and was a major figure in the development of positive FrancoAmerican relations. His efforts proved vital in securing French aid for the American Revolution. From 1785 to 1788, he served as President of Pennsylvania. At some points in his life, he owned slaves and ran &quot;for sale&quot; ads for slaves in his newspaper, but by the late 1750s, he began arguing against slavery, became an active abolitionist, and promoted the education and integration of African Americans into U.S. society.

As a scientist, Franklin&#x27;s studies of electricity made him a major figure in the American Enlightenment and the history of physics. He also charted and named the Gulf Stream current. His numerous important inventions include the lightning rod, bifocals, glass harmonica and the Franklin stove. He founded many civic organizations, including the Library Company, Philadelphia&#x27;s first fire department, and the University of Pennsylvania.
Franklin earned the title of &quot;The First American&quot; for his early and indefatigable campaigning for colonial unity. He was the only person to sign the Declaration of Independence, Treaty of Paris, peace with Britain and the Constitution. Foundational in defining the American ethos, Franklin has been called &quot;the most accomplished American of his age and the most influential in inventing the type of society America would become&quot;.

Franklin&#x27;s life and legacy of scientific and political achievement, and his status as one of America&#x27;s most influential Founding Fathers, have seen him honored for more than two centuries after his death on the $100 bill and in the names of warships, many towns and counties, educational institutions and corporations, as well as in numerous cultural references and a portrait in the Oval Office. His more than 30,000 letters and documents have been collected in &quot;The Papers of Benjamin Franklin.&quot; Anne Robert Jacques Turgot said of him: &quot;Eripuit fulmen cœlo, mox sceptra tyrannis&quot; (&quot;He snatched lightning from the sky and the scepter from tyrants&quot;).

==Ancestry==
Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s father, Josiah Franklin, was a tallow chandler, soaper, and candlemaker. Josiah Franklin was born at Ecton, Northamptonshire, England, on December 23, 1657, the son of Thomas Franklin, a blacksmith and farmer, and his wife, Jane White. Benjamin&#x27;s father and all four of his grandparents were born in England.

Josiah Franklin had a total of seventeen children with his two wives. He married his first wife, Anne Child, in about 1677 in Ecton and emigrated with her to Boston in 1683; they had three children before emigration and four after. Following her death, Josiah married Abiah Folger on July 9, 1689, in the Old South Meeting House by Reverend Samuel Willard, and had ten children with her. Benjamin, their eighth child, was Josiah Franklin&#x27;s fifteenth child overall, and his tenth and final son.

Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s mother, Abiah, was born in Nantucket, Massachusetts Bay Colony, on August 15, 1667, to Peter Folger, a miller and schoolteacher, and his wife, Mary Morrell Folger, a former indentured servant. Mary Folger came from a Puritan family that was among the first Pilgrims to flee to Massachusetts for religious freedom, sailing for Boston in 1635 after King Charles I of England had begun persecuting Puritans. Her father Peter was &quot;the sort of rebel destined to transform colonial America.&quot; As clerk of the court, he was arrested on February 10, 1676, and jailed on February 19 for his inability to pay bail. He spent over a year and a half in jail.

==Early life and education==
===Boston===

Franklin was born on Milk Street in Boston, Province of Massachusetts Bay on January 17, 1706, and baptized at the Old South Meeting House in Boston. As a child growing up along the Charles River, Franklin recalled that he was &quot;generally the leader among the boys.&quot;

Franklin&#x27;s father wanted him to attend school with the clergy but only had enough money to send him to school for two years. He attended Boston Latin School but did not graduate; he continued his education through voracious reading. Although &quot;his parents talked of the church as a career&quot; for Franklin, his schooling ended when he was ten. He worked for his father for a time, and at 12 he became an apprentice to his brother James, a printer, who taught him the printing trade. When Benjamin was 15, James founded &quot;The New-England Courant&quot;, which was the third newspaper founded in Boston.

When denied the chance to write a letter to the paper for publication, Franklin adopted the pseudonym of &quot;Silence Dogood,&quot; a middle-aged widow. Mrs. Dogood&#x27;s letters were published and became a subject of conversation around town. Neither James nor the &quot;Courant&quot; readers were aware of the ruse, and James was unhappy with Benjamin when he discovered the popular correspondent was his younger brother. Franklin was an advocate of free speech from an early age. When his brother was jailed for three weeks in 1722 for publishing material unflattering to the governor, young Franklin took over the newspaper and had Mrs. Dogood proclaim, quoting &quot;Cato&#x27;s Letters&quot;, &quot;Without freedom of thought there can be no such thing as wisdom and no such thing as public liberty without freedom of speech.&quot; Franklin left his apprenticeship without his brother&#x27;s permission, and in so doing became a fugitive.

===Moves to Philadelphia and London===
At age 17, Franklin ran away to Philadelphia, seeking a new start in a new city. When he first arrived, he worked in several printing shops there, but he was not satisfied by the immediate prospects in any of these jobs. After a few months, while working in one printing house, Pennsylvania governor Sir William Keith convinced him to go to London, ostensibly to acquire the equipment necessary for establishing another newspaper in Philadelphia. Discovering that Keith&#x27;s promises of backing a newspaper were empty, he worked as a typesetter in a printer&#x27;s shop in what is today the Lady Chapel of Church of St Bartholomew-the-Great in the Smithfield area of London, which had at that time been deconsecrated. He returned to Philadelphia in 1726 with the help of Thomas Denham, an English merchant who had emigrated but returned to England, and who employed Franklin as a clerk, shopkeeper, and bookkeeper in his business.

===Junto and library===
In 1727, at age 21, Franklin formed the Junto, a group of &quot;like minded aspiring artisans and tradesmen who hoped to improve themselves while they improved their community.&quot; The Junto was a discussion group for issues of the day; it subsequently gave rise to many organizations in Philadelphia. The Junto was modeled after English coffeehouses that Franklin knew well and which had become the center of the spread of Enlightenment ideas in Britain.

Reading was a great pastime of the Junto, but books were rare and expensive. The members created a library, initially assembled from their own books, after Franklin wrote:

This did not suffice, however. Franklin conceived the idea of a subscription library, which would pool the funds of the members to buy books for all to read. This was the birth of the Library Company of Philadelphia, whose charter he composed in 1731.

===Newspaperman===
Upon Denham&#x27;s death, Franklin returned to his former trade. In 1728, he set up a printing house in partnership with Hugh Meredith; the following year he became the publisher of &quot;The Pennsylvania Gazette&quot;, a newspaper in Philadelphia. The &quot;Gazette&quot; gave Franklin a forum for agitation about a variety of local reforms and initiatives through printed essays and observations. Over time, his commentary, and his adroit cultivation of a positive image as an industrious and intellectual young man, earned him a great deal of social respect. But even after he achieved fame as a scientist and statesman, he habitually signed his letters with the unpretentious &#x27;B. Franklin, Printer.&#x27;

In 1732, he published the first German-language newspaper in America – &quot;Die Philadelphische Zeitung&quot; – although it failed after only one year because four other newly founded German papers quickly dominated the newspaper market. Franklin also printed Moravian religious books in German. He often visited Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, staying at the Moravian Sun Inn. In a 1751 pamphlet on demographic growth and its implications for the Thirteen Colonies, he called the Pennsylvania Germans &quot;Palatine Boors&quot; who could never acquire the &quot;Complexion&quot; of Anglo-American settlers and referred to &quot;Blacks and Tawneys&quot; as weakening the social structure of the colonies. Although he apparently reconsidered shortly thereafter, and the phrases were omitted from all later printings of the pamphlet, his views may have played a role in his political defeat in 1764.

According to Ralph Frasca, Franklin promoted the printing press as a device to instruct colonial Americans in moral virtue. Frasca argues he saw this as a service to God, because he understood moral virtue in terms of actions, thus, doing good provides a service to God. Despite his own moral lapses, Franklin saw himself as uniquely qualified to instruct Americans in morality. He tried to influence American moral life through the construction of a printing network based on a chain of partnerships from the Carolinas to New England. He thereby invented the first newspaper chain. It was more than a business venture, for like many publishers he believed that the press had a public-service duty.

When he established himself in Philadelphia, shortly before 1730, the town boasted two &quot;wretched little&quot; news sheets, Andrew Bradford&#x27;s &quot;The American Weekly Mercury&quot; and Samuel Keimer&#x27;s &quot;Universal Instructor in all Arts and Sciences, and Pennsylvania Gazette&quot;. This instruction in all arts and sciences consisted of weekly extracts from &quot;Chambers&#x27;s Universal Dictionary&quot;. Franklin quickly did away with all of this when he took over the &quot;Instructor&quot; and made it &quot;The Pennsylvania Gazette&quot;. The &quot;Gazette&quot; soon became his characteristic organ, which he freely used for satire, for the play of his wit, even for sheer excess of mischief or of fun. From the first, he had a way of adapting his models to his own uses. The series of essays called &quot;The Busy-Body,&quot; which he wrote for Bradford&#x27;s &quot;American Mercury&quot; in 1729, followed the general Addisonian form, already modified to suit homelier conditions. The thrifty Patience, in her busy little shop, complaining of the useless visitors who waste her valuable time, is related to the women who address Mr. Spectator. The Busy-Body himself is a true Censor Morum, as Isaac Bickerstaff had been in the &quot;Tatler&quot;. And a number of the fictitious characters, Ridentius, Eugenius, Cato, and Cretico, represent traditional 18th-century classicism. Even this Franklin could use for contemporary satire, since Cretico, the &quot;sowre Philosopher,&quot; is evidently a portrait of his rival, Samuel Keimer.

Franklin had mixed success in his plan to establish an inter-colonial network of newspapers that would produce a profit for him and disseminate virtue. Over the years he sponsored two dozen printers in Pennsylvania, South Carolina, New York, Connecticut, and even the Caribbean. By 1753, eight of the fifteen English language newspapers in the colonies were published by him or his partners. He began in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1731. After his second editor died, the widow, Elizabeth Timothy, took over and made it a success. She was one of the colonial era&#x27;s first woman printers. For three decades Franklin maintained a close business relationship with her and her son Peter Timothy, who took over the &quot;South Carolina Gazette&quot; in 1746. The &quot;Gazette&quot; was impartial in political debates, while creating the opportunity for public debate, which encouraged others to challenge authority. Timothy avoided blandness and crude bias and, after 1765, increasingly took a patriotic stand in the growing crisis with Great Britain. Franklin&#x27;s &quot;Connecticut Gazette&quot; (1755–68), however, proved unsuccessful. As the Revolution approached, political strife slowly tore his network apart.

===Freemasonry===
In 1730 or 1731, Franklin was initiated into the local Masonic lodge. He became a grand master in 1734, indicating his rapid rise to prominence in Pennsylvania. The same year, he edited and published the first Masonic book in the Americas, a reprint of James Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Constitutions of the Free-Masons&quot;. He was the secretary of St. John&#x27;s Lodge in Philadelphia from 1735 to 1738.

In January 1738, &quot;Franklin appeared as a witness&quot; in a manslaughter trial against two men who killed &quot;a simple-minded apprentice&quot; named Daniel Rees in a fake Masonic initiation gone wrong. One of the men &quot;threw, or accidentally spilled, the burning spirits, and Daniel Rees died of his burns two days later.&quot; While Franklin did not directly participate in the hazing that led to Rees&#x27; death, he knew of the hazing before it turned fatal, and did nothing to stop it. He was criticized for his inaction in &quot;The American Weekly Mercury&quot;, by his publishing rival Andrew Bradford. Ultimately, &quot;Franklin replied in his own defense in the &quot;Gazette.&quot;&quot;

Franklin remained a Freemason for the rest of his life.

===Common-law marriage to Deborah Read===

At age 17 in 1723, Franklin proposed to 15-year-old Deborah Read while a boarder in the Read home. At that time, Deborah&#x27;s mother was wary of allowing her young daughter to marry Franklin, who was on his way to London at Governor Keith&#x27;s request, and also because of his financial instability. Her own husband had recently died, and she declined Franklin&#x27;s request to marry her daughter.

Franklin travelled to London, and after he failed to communicate as expected with Deborah and her family, they interpreted his long silence as a breaking of his promises. At the urging of her mother, Deborah married a potter named John Rogers on August 5, 1725. John soon fled to Barbados with her dowry in order to avoid debts and prosecution. Since Rogers&#x27; fate was unknown, bigamy laws prevented Deborah from remarrying.

Franklin returned in 1726 and resumed his courtship of Deborah. They established a common-law marriage on September 1, 1730. They took in his recently acknowledged illegitimate young son and raised him in their household. They had two children together. Their son, Francis Folger Franklin, was born in October 1732 and died of smallpox in 1736. Their daughter, Sarah &quot;Sally&quot; Franklin, was born in 1743 and eventually married Richard Bache.

Deborah&#x27;s fear of the sea meant that she never accompanied Franklin on any of his extended trips to Europe; another possible reason why they spent much time apart is that he may have blamed her for possibly preventing their son Francis from being inoculated against the disease that subsequently killed him. Deborah wrote to him in November 1769, saying she was ill due to &quot;dissatisfied distress&quot; from his prolonged absence, but he did not return until his business was done. Deborah Read Franklin died of a stroke on December 14, 1774, while Franklin was on an extended mission to Great Britain; he returned in 1775.

===William Franklin===
In 1730, 24-year-old Franklin publicly acknowledged his illegitimate son William and raised him in his household. William was born on February 22, 1730, but his mother&#x27;s identity is unknown. He was educated in Philadelphia and beginning at about age 30 studied law in London in the early 1760s. William himself fathered an illegitimate son, William Temple Franklin, born on the same day and month: February 22, 1760. The boy&#x27;s mother was never identified, and he was placed in foster care. In 1762, the elder William Franklin married Elizabeth Downes, daughter of a planter from Barbados, in London. In 1763, he was appointed as the last royal governor of New Jersey.

A Loyalist to the king, William Franklin saw his relations with father Benjamin eventually break down over their differences about the American Revolutionary War, as Benjamin Franklin could never accept William&#x27;s position. Deposed in 1776 by the revolutionary government of New Jersey, William was placed under house arrest at his home in Perth Amboy for six months. After the Declaration of Independence, he was formally taken into custody by order of the Provincial Congress of New Jersey, an entity which he refused to recognize, regarding it as an &quot;illegal assembly.&quot; He was incarcerated in Connecticut for two years, in Wallingford and Middletown, and, after being caught surreptitiously engaging Americans into supporting the Loyalist cause, was held in solitary confinement at Litchfield for eight months. When finally released in a prisoner exchange in 1778, he moved to New York City, which was occupied by the British at the time.

While in New York City, he became leader of the Board of Associated Loyalists, a quasi-military organization chartered by King George III and headquartered in New York City. They initiated guerrilla forays into New Jersey, southern Connecticut, and New York counties north of the city. When British troops evacuated from New York, William Franklin left with them and sailed to England. He settled in London, never to return to North America. In the preliminary peace talks in 1782 with Britain, &quot;... Benjamin Franklin insisted that loyalists who had borne arms against the United States would be excluded from this plea (that they be given a general pardon). He was undoubtedly thinking of William Franklin.&quot;
===Success as an author===

In 1732, Franklin began to publish the noted &quot;Poor Richard&#x27;s Almanack&quot; (with content both original and borrowed) under the pseudonym Richard Saunders, on which much of his popular reputation is based. He frequently wrote under pseudonyms. The first issue published was for the upcoming year, 1733. He had developed a distinct, signature style that was plain, pragmatic and had a sly, soft but self-deprecating tone with declarative sentences. Although it was no secret that he was the author, his Richard Saunders character repeatedly denied it. &quot;Poor Richard&#x27;s Proverbs,&quot; adages from this almanac, such as &quot;A penny saved is twopence dear&quot; (often misquoted as &quot;A penny saved is a penny earned&quot;) and &quot;Fish and visitors stink in three days,&quot; remain common quotations in the modern world. Wisdom in folk society meant the ability to provide an apt adage for any occasion, and his readers became well prepared. He sold about ten thousand copies per year—it became an institution. In 1741, Franklin began publishing &quot;The General Magazine and Historical Chronicle for all the British Plantations in America.&quot; He used the heraldic badge of the Prince of Wales as the cover illustration.

Franklin wrote a letter, &quot;Advice to a Friend on Choosing a Mistress,&quot; dated June 25, 1745, in which he gives advice to a young man about channeling sexual urges. Due to its licentious nature, it was not published in collections of his papers during the 19th century. Federal court rulings from the mid-to-late 20th century cited the document as a reason for overturning obscenity laws and against censorship.

==Public life==

===Early steps in Pennsylvania===

In 1736, Franklin created the Union Fire Company, one of the first volunteer firefighting companies in America. In the same year, he printed a new currency for New Jersey based on innovative anti-counterfeiting techniques he had devised. Throughout his career, he was an advocate for paper money, publishing &quot;A Modest Enquiry into the Nature and Necessity of a Paper Currency&quot; in 1729, and his printer printed money. He was influential in the more restrained and thus successful monetary experiments in the Middle Colonies, which stopped deflation without causing excessive inflation. In 1766, he made a case for paper money to the British House of Commons.

As he matured, Franklin began to concern himself more with public affairs. In 1743, he first devised a scheme for the Academy, Charity School, and College of Philadelphia; however, the person he had in mind to run the academy, Rev. Richard Peters, refused and Franklin put his ideas away until 1749 when he printed his own pamphlet, &quot;Proposals Relating to the Education of Youth in Pensilvania.&quot; He was appointed president of the Academy on November 13, 1749; the academy and the charity school opened in 1751.

In 1743, he founded the American Philosophical Society to help scientific men discuss their discoveries and theories. He began the electrical research that, along with other scientific inquiries, would occupy him for the rest of his life, in between bouts of politics and moneymaking.

During King George&#x27;s War, Franklin raised a militia called the Association for General Defense because the legislators of the city had decided to take no action to defend Philadelphia &quot;either by erecting fortifications or building Ships of War.&quot; He raised money to create earthwork defenses and buy artillery. The largest of these was the &quot;Association Battery&quot; or &quot;Grand Battery&quot; of 50 guns.

In 1747, Franklin (already a very wealthy man) retired from printing and went into other businesses. He formed a partnership with his foreman, David Hall, which provided Franklin with half of the shop&#x27;s profits for 18 years. This lucrative business arrangement provided leisure time for study, and in a few years he had made many new discoveries.

Franklin became involved in Philadelphia politics and rapidly progressed. In October 1748, he was selected as a councilman; in June 1749, he became a justice of the peace for Philadelphia; and in 1751, he was elected to the Pennsylvania Assembly. On August 10, 1753, he was appointed deputy postmaster-general of British North America. His service in domestic politics included reforming the postal system, with mail sent out every week.

In 1751, Franklin and Thomas Bond obtained a charter from the Pennsylvania legislature to establish a hospital. Pennsylvania Hospital was the first hospital in the colonies. In 1752, Franklin organized the Philadelphia Contributionship, the Colonies&#x27; first homeowner&#x27;s insurance company.

Between 1750 and 1753, the &quot;educational triumvirate&quot; of Franklin, Samuel Johnson of Stratford, Connecticut, and schoolteacher William Smith built on Franklin&#x27;s initial scheme and created what Bishop James Madison, president of the College of William &amp; Mary, called a &quot;new-model&quot; plan or style of American college. Franklin solicited, printed in 1752, and promoted an American textbook of moral philosophy by Samuel Johnson, titled &quot;Elementa Philosophica&quot;, to be taught in the new colleges. In June 1753, Johnson, Franklin, and Smith met in Stratford. They decided the new-model college would focus on the professions, with classes taught in English instead of Latin, have subject matter experts as professors instead of one tutor leading a class for four years, and there would be no religious test for admission. Johnson went on to found King&#x27;s College (now Columbia University) in New York City in 1754, while Franklin hired Smith as provost of the College of Philadelphia, which opened in 1755. At its first commencement, on May 17, 1757, seven men graduated; six with a Bachelor of Arts and one with a Master of Arts. It was later merged with the University of the State of Pennsylvania to become the University of Pennsylvania. The college was to become influential in guiding the founding documents of the United States: in the Continental Congress, for example, over one-third of the college-affiliated men who contributed to the Declaration of Independence between September 4, 1774, and July 4, 1776, were affiliated with the college.

In 1754, he headed the Pennsylvania delegation to the Albany Congress. This meeting of several colonies had been requested by the Board of Trade in England to improve relations with the Indians and defense against the French. Franklin proposed a broad Plan of Union for the colonies. While the plan was not adopted, elements of it found their way into the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution.

In 1753, Harvard University and Yale awarded him honorary master of arts degrees. In 1756, he was awarded an honorary Master of Arts degree from the College of William &amp; Mary. Later in 1756, Franklin organized the Pennsylvania Militia. He used Tun Tavern as a gathering place to recruit a regiment of soldiers to go into battle against the Native American uprisings that beset the American colonies.

=== Postmaster ===

Well known as a printer and publisher, Franklin was appointed postmaster of Philadelphia in 1737, holding the office until 1753, when he and publisher William Hunter were named deputy postmasters–general of British North America, the first to hold the office. (Joint appointments were standard at the time, for political reasons.) He was responsible for the British colonies from Pennsylvania north and east, as far as the island of Newfoundland. A post office for local and outgoing mail had been established in Halifax, Nova Scotia, by local stationer Benjamin Leigh, on April 23, 1754, but service was irregular. Franklin opened the first post office to offer regular, monthly mail in Halifax on December 9, 1755. Meantime, Hunter became postal administrator in Williamsburg, Virginia, and oversaw areas south of Annapolis, Maryland. Franklin reorganized the service&#x27;s accounting system and improved speed of delivery between Philadelphia, New York, and Boston. By 1761, efficiencies led to the first profits for the colonial post office.

When the lands of New France were ceded to the British under the Treaty of Paris in 1763, the British province of Quebec was created among them, and Franklin saw mail service expanded between Montreal, Trois-Rivières, Quebec City, and New York. For the greater part of his appointment, he lived in England (from 1757 to 1762, and again from 1764 to 1774)—about three-quarters of his term. Eventually, his sympathies for the rebel cause in the American Revolution led to his dismissal on January 31, 1774.

On July 26, 1775, the Second Continental Congress established the United States Post Office and named Franklin as the first United States postmaster general. He had been a postmaster for decades and was a natural choice for the position. He had just returned from England and was appointed chairman of a Committee of Investigation to establish a postal system. The report of the committee, providing for the appointment of a postmaster general for the 13 American colonies, was considered by the Continental Congress on July 25 and 26. On July 26, 1775, Franklin was appointed postmaster general, the first appointed under the Continental Congress. His apprentice, William Goddard, felt that his ideas were mostly responsible for shaping the postal system and that the appointment should have gone to him, but he graciously conceded it to Franklin, 36 years his senior. Franklin, however, appointed Goddard as Surveyor of the Posts, issued him a signed pass, and directed him to investigate and inspect the various post offices and mail routes as he saw fit. The newly established postal system became the United States Post Office, a system that continues to operate today.

====Political work====

In 1757, he was sent to England by the Pennsylvania Assembly as a colonial agent to protest against the political influence of the Penn family, the proprietors of the colony. He remained there for five years, striving to end the proprietors&#x27; prerogative to overturn legislation from the elected Assembly and their exemption from paying taxes on their land. His lack of influential allies in Whitehall led to the failure of this mission.

At this time, many members of the Pennsylvania Assembly were feuding with William Penn&#x27;s heirs, who controlled the colony as proprietors. After his return to the colony, Franklin led the &quot;anti-proprietary party&quot; in the struggle against the Penn family and was elected Speaker of the Pennsylvania House in May 1764. His call for a change from proprietary to royal government was a rare political miscalculation, however: Pennsylvanians worried that such a move would endanger their political and religious freedoms. Because of these fears and because of political attacks on his character, Franklin lost his seat in the October 1764 Assembly elections. The anti-proprietary party dispatched him to England again to continue the struggle against the Penn family proprietorship. During this trip, events drastically changed the nature of his mission.

In London, Franklin opposed the 1765 Stamp Act. Unable to prevent its passage, he made another political miscalculation and recommended a friend to the post of stamp distributor for Pennsylvania. Pennsylvanians were outraged, believing that he had supported the measure all along, and threatened to destroy his home in Philadelphia. Franklin soon learned of the extent of colonial resistance to the Stamp Act, and he testified during the House of Commons proceedings that led to its repeal. With this, Franklin suddenly emerged as the leading spokesman for American interests in England. He wrote popular essays on behalf of the colonies. Georgia, New Jersey, and Massachusetts also appointed him as their agent to the Crown.

During his lengthy missions to London between 1757 and 1775, Franklin lodged in a house on Craven Street, just off the Strand in central London. During his stays there, he developed a close friendship with his landlady, Margaret Stevenson, and her circle of friends and relations, in particular, her daughter Mary, who was more often known as Polly. The house is now a museum known as the Benjamin Franklin House. Whilst in London, Franklin became involved in radical politics. He belonged to a gentlemen&#x27;s club (which he called &quot;the honest Whigs&quot;), which held stated meetings, and included members such as Richard Price, the minister of Newington Green Unitarian Church who ignited the Revolution controversy, and Andrew Kippis.

====Scientific work====
In 1756, Franklin had become a member of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures &amp; Commerce (now the Royal Society of Arts), which had been founded in 1754. After his return to the United States in 1775, he became the Society&#x27;s Corresponding Member, continuing a close connection. The Royal Society of Arts instituted a Benjamin Franklin Medal in 1956 to commemorate the 250th anniversary of his birth and the 200th anniversary of his membership of the RSA.

The study of natural philosophy (referred today as science in general) drew him into overlapping circles of acquaintance. Franklin was, for example, a corresponding member of the Lunar Society of Birmingham. In 1759, the University of St Andrews awarded him an honorary doctorate in recognition of his accomplishments. In October 1759, he was granted Freedom of the Borough of St Andrews. He was also awarded an honorary doctorate by Oxford University in 1762. Because of these honors, he was often addressed as &quot; Franklin.&quot;

While living in London in 1768, he developed a phonetic alphabet in &quot;A Scheme for a new Alphabet and a Reformed Mode of Spelling&quot;. This reformed alphabet discarded six letters he regarded as redundant (c, j, q, w, x, and y), and substituted six new letters for sounds he felt lacked letters of their own. This alphabet never caught on, and he eventually lost interest.

===Return to London and Travels in Europe===
From the mid-1750s to the mid-1770s, Franklin returned to England and spent much of his time in London., using the city as a base from which to travel. In 1771, he made short journeys through different parts of England, staying with Joseph Priestley at Leeds, Thomas Percival at Manchester and Erasmus Darwin at Lichfield. In Scotland, he spent five days with Lord Kames near Stirling and stayed for three weeks with David Hume in Edinburgh. In 1759, he visited Edinburgh with his son and later reported that he considered his six weeks in Scotland &quot;six weeks of the densest happiness I have met with in any part of my life.&quot;

In Ireland, he stayed with Lord Hillsborough. Franklin noted of him that &quot;all the plausible behaviour I have described is meant only, by patting and stroking the horse, to make him more patient, while the reins are drawn tighter, and the spurs set deeper into his sides.&quot; In Dublin, Franklin was invited to sit with the members of the Irish Parliament rather than in the gallery. He was the first American to receive this honor. While touring Ireland, he was deeply moved by the level of poverty he witnessed. The economy of the Kingdom of Ireland was affected by the same trade regulations and laws that governed the Thirteen Colonies. He feared that the American colonies could eventually come to the same level of poverty if the regulations and laws continued to apply to them.

Franklin spent two months in German lands in 1766, but his connections to the country stretched across a lifetime. He declared a debt of gratitude to German scientist Otto von Guericke for his early studies of electricity. Franklin also co-authored the first treaty of friendship between Prussia and America in 1785. In September 1767, he visited Paris with his usual traveling partner, Sir John Pringle, 1st Baronet. News of his electrical discoveries was widespread in France. His reputation meant that he was introduced to many influential scientists and politicians, and also to King Louis XV.

===Defending the American cause===
One line of argument in Parliament was that Americans should pay a share of the costs of the French and Indian War and therefore taxes should be levied on them. Franklin became the American spokesman in highly publicized testimony in Parliament in 1766. He stated that Americans already contributed heavily to the defense of the Empire. He said local governments had raised, outfitted and paid 25,000 soldiers to fight France—as many as Great Britain itself sent—and spent many millions from American treasuries doing so in the French and Indian War alone.

In 1772, Franklin obtained private letters of Thomas Hutchinson and Andrew Oliver, governor and lieutenant governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, proving that they had encouraged the Crown to crack down on Bostonians. Franklin sent them to North America, where they escalated tensions. The letters were finally leaked to the public in the &quot;Boston Gazette&quot; in mid-June 1773, causing a political firestorm in Massachusetts and raising significant questions in England. The British began to regard him as the fomenter of serious trouble. Hopes for a peaceful solution ended as he was systematically ridiculed and humiliated by Solicitor-General Alexander Wedderburn, before the Privy Council on January 29, 1774. He returned to Philadelphia in March 1775, and abandoned his accommodationist stance.

In 1773, Franklin published two of his most celebrated pro-American satirical essays: and &quot;An Edict by the King of Prussia.&quot;

=== Agent for British and Hellfire Club membership ===
Franklin is known to have occasionally attended the Hellfire Club&#x27;s meetings during 1758 as a non-member during his time in England. However, some authors and historians would argue he was in fact a British spy. As there are no records left (having been burned in 1774), many of these members are just assumed or linked by letters sent to each other. One early proponent that Franklin was a member of the Hellfire Club and a double agent is the historian Donald McCormick, who has a history of making controversial claims.

===Coming of revolution===
In 1763, soon after Franklin returned to Pennsylvania from England for the first time, the western frontier was engulfed in a bitter war known as Pontiac&#x27;s Rebellion. The Paxton Boys, a group of settlers convinced that the Pennsylvania government was not doing enough to protect them from American Indian raids, murdered a group of peaceful Susquehannock Indians and marched on Philadelphia. Franklin helped to organize a local militia to defend the capital against the mob. He met with the Paxton leaders and persuaded them to disperse. Franklin wrote a scathing attack against the racial prejudice of the Paxton Boys. &quot;If an &quot;Indian&quot; injures me,&quot; he asked, &quot;does it follow that I may revenge that injury on all &quot;Indians&quot;?&quot;

He provided an early response to British surveillance through his own network of counter-surveillance and manipulation. &quot;He waged a public relations campaign, secured secret aid, played a role in privateering expeditions, and churned out effective and inflammatory propaganda.&quot;

===Declaration of Independence===

By the time Franklin arrived in Philadelphia on May 5, 1775, after his second mission to Great Britain, the American Revolution had begun at the Battles of Lexington and Concord the previous month, on April 19, 1775. The New England militia had forced the main British army to remain inside Boston. The Pennsylvania Assembly unanimously chose Franklin as their delegate to the Second Continental Congress. In June 1776, he was appointed a member of the Committee of Five that drafted the Declaration of Independence. Although he was temporarily disabled by gout and unable to attend most meetings of the committee, he made several &quot;small but important&quot; changes to the draft sent to him by Thomas Jefferson.

At the signing, he is quoted as having replied to a comment by John Hancock that they must all hang together, saying, &quot;Yes, we must, indeed, all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang separately.&quot;

===Ambassador to France (1776–1785)===

On October 26, 1776, Franklin was dispatched to France as commissioner for the United States. He took with him as secretary his 16-year-old grandson, William Temple Franklin. They lived in a home in the Parisian suburb of Passy, donated by Jacques-Donatien Le Ray de Chaumont, who supported the United States. Franklin remained in France until 1785. He conducted the affairs of his country toward the French nation with great success, which included securing a critical military alliance in 1778 and signing the 1783 Treaty of Paris.

Among his associates in France was Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau—a French Revolutionary writer, orator and statesman who in 1791 was elected president of the National Assembly. In July 1784, Franklin met with Mirabeau and contributed anonymous materials that the Frenchman used in his first signed work: &quot;Considerations sur l&#x27;ordre de Cincinnatus&quot;. The publication was critical of the Society of the Cincinnati, established in the United States. Franklin and Mirabeau thought of it as a &quot;noble order,&quot; inconsistent with the egalitarian ideals of the new republic.

During his stay in France, he was active as a Freemason, serving as venerable master of the lodge Les Neuf Sœurs from 1779 until 1781. In 1784, when Franz Mesmer began to publicize his theory of &quot;animal magnetism&quot; which was considered offensive by many, Louis XVI appointed a commission to investigate it. These included the chemist Antoine Lavoisier, the physician Joseph-Ignace Guillotin, the astronomer Jean Sylvain Bailly, and Franklin. In doing so, the committee concluded, through blind trials that mesmerism only seemed to work when the subjects expected it, which discredited mesmerism and became the first major demonstration of the placebo effect, which was described at that time as &quot;imagination.&quot; In 1781, he was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Franklin&#x27;s advocacy for religious tolerance in France contributed to arguments made by French philosophers and politicians that resulted in Louis XVI&#x27;s signing of the Edict of Versailles in November 1787. This edict effectively nullified the Edict of Fontainebleau, which had denied non-Catholics civil status and the right to openly practice their faith.

Franklin also served as American minister to Sweden, although he never visited that country. He negotiated a treaty that was signed in April 1783. On August 27, 1783, in Paris, he witnessed the world&#x27;s first hydrogen balloon flight. &quot;Le Globe&quot;, created by professor Jacques Charles and Les Frères Robert, was watched by a vast crowd as it rose from the Champ de Mars (now the site of the Eiffel Tower). Franklin became so enthusiastic that he subscribed financially to the next project to build a manned hydrogen balloon. On December 1, 1783, Franklin was seated in the special enclosure for honored guests it took off from the Jardin des Tuileries, piloted by Charles and Nicolas-Louis Robert. Walter Isaacson describes a chess game between Franklin and the Duchess of Bourbon, &quot;who made a move that inadvertently exposed her king. Ignoring the rules of the game, he promptly captured it. &#x27;Ah,&#x27; said the duchess, &#x27;we do not take Kings so.&#x27; Replied Franklin in a famous quip: &#x27;We do in America.&#x27;&quot;

===Return to North America===

When he returned home in 1785, Franklin occupied a position second only to that of George Washington as the champion of American independence. Le Ray honored him with a commissioned portrait painted by Joseph Duplessis, which now hangs in the National Portrait Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. After his return, Franklin became an abolitionist and freed his two slaves. He eventually became president of the Pennsylvania Abolition Society.

==== President of Pennsylvania and Delegate to the Constitutional convention ====
Special balloting conducted October 18, 1785, unanimously elected him the sixth president of the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania, replacing John Dickinson. The office was practically that of the governor. He held that office for slightly over three years, longer than any other, and served the constitutional limit of three full terms. Shortly after his initial election, he was re-elected to a full term on October 29, 1785, and again in the fall of 1786 and on October 31, 1787. In that capacity, he served as host to the Constitutional Convention of 1787 in Philadelphia.

He also served as a delegate to the Convention. It was primarily an honorary position and he seldom engaged in debate.
According to James McHenry, Elizabeth Willing Powel asked Franklin what kind of government they had wrought. He replied: &quot;A republic, madam, if you can keep it.&quot;

==Death==
Franklin suffered from obesity throughout his middle age and elder years, which resulted in multiple health problems, particularly gout, which worsened as he aged. In poor health during the signing of the U.S. Constitution in 1787, he was rarely seen in public from then until his death.

Franklin died from pleuritic attack at his home in Philadelphia on April 17, 1790. He was aged 84 at the time of his death. His last words were reportedly, &quot;a dying man can do nothing easy,&quot; to his daughter after she suggested that he change position in bed and lie on his side so he could breathe more easily. Franklin&#x27;s death is described in the book &quot;The Life of Benjamin Franklin&quot;, quoting from the account of John Paul Jones:

Approximately 20,000 people attended Franklin&#x27;s funeral after which he was interred in Christ Church Burial Ground in Philadelphia. Upon learning of his death, the Constitutional Assembly in Revolutionary France entered into a state of mourning for a period of three days, and memorial services were conducted in honor of Franklin throughout the country.

In 1728, aged 22, Franklin wrote what he hoped would be his own epitaph:

Franklin&#x27;s actual grave, however, as he specified in his final will, simply reads &quot;Benjamin and Deborah Franklin.&quot;

==Inventions and scientific inquiries==
Franklin was a prodigious inventor. Among his many creations were the lightning rod, Franklin stove, bifocal glasses and the flexible urinary catheter. He never patented his inventions; in his autobiography he wrote, &quot;... as we enjoy great advantages from the inventions of others, we should be glad of an opportunity to serve others by any invention of ours; and this we should do freely and generously.&quot;

===Electricity===

Franklin started exploring the phenomenon of electricity in the 1740s, after he met the itinerant lecturer Archibald Spencer, who used static electricity in his demonstrations. He proposed that &quot;vitreous&quot; and &quot;resinous&quot; electricity were not different types of &quot;electrical fluid&quot; (as electricity was called then), but the same &quot;fluid&quot; under different pressures. (The same proposal was made independently that same year by William Watson.) He was the first to label them as positive and negative respectively, which replaced the then current distinction made between &#x27;vitreous&#x27; and &#x27;resinous&#x27; electricity, and he was the first to discover the principle of conservation of charge. In 1748, he constructed a multiple plate capacitor, that he called an &quot;electrical battery&quot; (not a true battery like Volta&#x27;s pile) by placing eleven panes of glass sandwiched between lead plates, suspended with silk cords and connected by wires.

In pursuit of more pragmatic uses for electricity, remarking in spring 1749 that he felt &quot;chagrin&#x27;d a little&quot; that his experiments had heretofore resulted in &quot;Nothing in this Way of Use to Mankind,&quot; Franklin planned a practical demonstration. He proposed a dinner party where a turkey was to be killed via electric shock and roasted on an electrical spit. After having prepared several turkeys this way, he noted that &quot;the birds kill&#x27;d in this manner eat uncommonly tender.&quot; Franklin recounted that in the process of one of these experiments, he was shocked by a pair of Leyden jars, resulting in numbness in his arms that persisted for one evening, noting &quot;I am Ashamed to have been Guilty of so Notorious a Blunder.&quot;

Franklin briefly investigated electrotherapy, including the use of the electric bath. This work led to the field becoming widely known. In recognition of his work with electricity, he received the Royal Society&#x27;s Copley Medal in 1753, and in 1756, he became one of the few 18th-century Americans elected a fellow of the Society. The CGS unit of electric charge has been named after him: one &quot;franklin&quot; (Fr) is equal to one statcoulomb.

Franklin advised Harvard University in its acquisition of new electrical laboratory apparatus after the complete loss of its original collection, in a fire that destroyed the original Harvard Hall in 1764. The collection he assembled later became part of the Harvard Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments, now on public display in its Science Center.

====Kite experiment and lightning rod====

Franklin published a proposal for an experiment to prove that lightning is electricity by flying a kite in a storm. On May 10, 1752, Thomas-François Dalibard of France conducted Franklin&#x27;s experiment using a iron rod instead of a kite, and he extracted electrical sparks from a cloud. On June 15, 1752, Franklin may possibly have conducted his well-known kite experiment in Philadelphia, successfully extracting sparks from a cloud. He described the experiment in his newspaper, &quot;The Pennsylvania Gazette&quot;, on October 19, 1752, without mentioning that he himself had performed it. This account was read to the Royal Society on December 21 and printed as such in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot;. Joseph Priestley published an account with additional details in his 1767 &quot;History and Present Status of Electricity&quot;. Franklin was careful to stand on an insulator, keeping dry under a roof to avoid the danger of electric shock. Others, such as Georg Wilhelm Richmann in Russia, were indeed electrocuted in performing lightning experiments during the months immediately following his experiment.

In his writings, Franklin indicates that he was aware of the dangers and offered alternative ways to demonstrate that lightning was electrical, as shown by his use of the concept of electrical ground. He did not perform this experiment in the way that is often pictured in popular literature, flying the kite and waiting to be struck by lightning, as it would have been dangerous. Instead he used the kite to collect some electric charge from a storm cloud, showing that lightning was electrical. On October 19, 1752, in a letter to England with directions for repeating the experiment, he wrote:

Franklin&#x27;s electrical experiments led to his invention of the lightning rod. He said that conductors with a sharp rather than a smooth point could discharge silently and at a far greater distance. He surmised that this could help protect buildings from lightning by attaching &quot;upright Rods of Iron, made sharp as a Needle and gilt to prevent Rusting, and from the Foot of those Rods a Wire down the outside of the Building into the Ground; ... Would not these pointed Rods probably draw the Electrical Fire silently out of a Cloud before it came nigh enough to strike, and thereby secure us from that most sudden and terrible Mischief!&quot; Following a series of experiments on Franklin&#x27;s own house, lightning rods were installed on the Academy of Philadelphia (later the University of Pennsylvania) and the Pennsylvania State House (later Independence Hall) in 1752.

===Population studies===
Franklin had a major influence on the emerging science of demography or population studies. In the 1730s and 1740s, he began taking notes on population growth, finding that the American population had the fastest growth rate on Earth. Emphasizing that population growth depended on food supplies, he emphasized the abundance of food and available farmland in America. He calculated that America&#x27;s population was doubling every 20 years and would surpass that of England in a century. In 1751, he drafted &quot;Observations concerning the Increase of Mankind, Peopling of Countries, etc.&quot; Four years later, it was anonymously printed in Boston and was quickly reproduced in Britain, where it influenced the economist Adam Smith and later the demographer Thomas Malthus, who credited Franklin for discovering a rule of population growth. Franklin&#x27;s predictions on how British mercantilism was unsustainable alarmed British leaders who did not want to be surpassed by the colonies, so they became more willing to impose restrictions on the colonial economy.

Kammen (1990) and Drake (2011) say Franklin&#x27;s &quot;Observations concerning the Increase of Mankind&quot; (1755) stands alongside Ezra Stiles&#x27; &quot;Discourse on Christian Union&quot; (1760) as the leading works of 18th-century Anglo-American demography; Drake credits Franklin&#x27;s &quot;wide readership and prophetic insight.&quot; Franklin was also a pioneer in the study of slave demography, as shown in his 1755 essay. In his capacity as a farmer, he wrote at least one critique about the negative consequences of price controls, trade restrictions, and subsidy of the poor. This is succinctly preserved in his letter to the &quot;London Chronicle&quot; published November 29, 1766, titled &quot;On the Price of Corn, and Management of the poor.&quot;

===Oceanography===
As deputy postmaster, Franklin became interested in North Atlantic Ocean circulation patterns. While in England in 1768, he heard a complaint from the Colonial Board of Customs. British packet ships carrying mail had taken several weeks longer to reach New York than it took an average merchant ship to reach Newport, Rhode Island. The merchantmen had a longer and more complex voyage because they left from London, while the packets left from Falmouth in Cornwall. Franklin put the question to his cousin Timothy Folger, a Nantucket whaler captain, who told him that merchant ships routinely avoided a strong eastbound mid-ocean current. The mail packet captains sailed dead into it, thus fighting an adverse current of . Franklin worked with Folger and other experienced ship captains, learning enough to chart the current and name it the Gulf Stream, by which it is still known today.

Franklin published his Gulf Stream chart in 1770 in England, where it was ignored. Subsequent versions were printed in France in 1778 and the U.S. in 1786. The British original edition of the chart had been so thoroughly ignored that everyone assumed it was lost forever until Phil Richardson, a Woods Hole oceanographer and Gulf Stream expert, discovered it in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris in 1980. This find received front-page coverage in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. It took many years for British sea captains to adopt Franklin&#x27;s advice on navigating the current; once they did, they were able to trim two weeks from their sailing time. In 1853, the oceanographer and cartographer Matthew Fontaine Maury noted that while Franklin charted and codified the Gulf Stream, he did not discover it:

An aging Franklin accumulated all his oceanographic findings in &quot;Maritime Observations&quot;, published by the Philosophical Society&#x27;s &quot;transactions&quot; in 1786. It contained ideas for sea anchors, catamaran hulls, watertight compartments, shipboard lightning rods and a soup bowl designed to stay stable in stormy weather.

===Theories and experiments===
Franklin was, along with his contemporary Leonhard Euler, the only major scientist who supported Christiaan Huygens&#x27;s wave theory of light, which was basically ignored by the rest of the scientific community. In the 18th century, Isaac Newton&#x27;s corpuscular theory was held to be true; it took Thomas Young&#x27;s well-known slit experiment in 1803 to persuade most scientists to believe Huygens&#x27;s theory.

On October 21, 1743, according to the popular myth, a storm moving from the southwest denied Franklin the opportunity of witnessing a lunar eclipse. He was said to have noted that the prevailing winds were actually from the northeast, contrary to what he had expected. In correspondence with his brother, he learned that the same storm had not reached Boston until after the eclipse, despite the fact that Boston is to the northeast of Philadelphia. He deduced that storms do not always travel in the direction of the prevailing wind, a concept that greatly influenced meteorology. After the Icelandic volcanic eruption of Laki in 1783, and the subsequent harsh European winter of 1784, Franklin made observations on the causal nature of these two seemingly separate events. He wrote about them in a lecture series.

Though Franklin is famously associated with kites from his lightning experiments, he has also been noted by many for using kites to pull humans and ships across waterways. George Pocock in the book &quot;A Treatise on The Aeropleustic Art, or Navigation in the Air, by means of Kites, or Buoyant Sails&quot; noted being inspired by Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s traction of his body by kite power across a waterway.

Franklin noted a principle of refrigeration by observing that on a very hot day, he stayed cooler in a wet shirt in a breeze than he did in a dry one. To understand this phenomenon more clearly, he conducted experiments. In 1758 on a warm day in Cambridge, England, he and fellow scientist John Hadley experimented by continually wetting the ball of a mercury thermometer with ether and using bellows to evaporate the ether. With each subsequent evaporation, the thermometer read a lower temperature, eventually reaching . Another thermometer showed that the room temperature was constant at . In his letter &quot;Cooling by Evaporation&quot;, Franklin noted that, &quot;One may see the possibility of freezing a man to death on a warm summer&#x27;s day.&quot;

In 1761, Franklin wrote a letter to Mary Stevenson describing his experiments on the relationship between color and heat absorption. He found that darker color clothes got hotter when exposed to sunlight than lighter color clothes, an early demonstration of black body thermal radiation. One experiment he performed consisted of placing square pieces of cloth of various color out in the snow on a sunny day. He waited some time and then measured that the black pieces sank furthest into the snow of all the colors, indicating that they got the hottest and melted the most snow.

According to Michael Faraday, Franklin&#x27;s experiments on the non-conduction of ice are worth mentioning, although the law of the general effect of liquefaction on electrolytes is not attributed to Franklin. However, as reported in 1836 by Franklin&#x27;s great-grandson Alexander Dallas Bache of the University of Pennsylvania, the law of the effect of heat on the conduction of bodies otherwise non-conductors, for example, glass, could be attributed to Franklin. Franklin wrote, &quot;... A certain quantity of heat will make some bodies good conductors, that will not otherwise conduct ...&quot; and again, &quot;... And water, though naturally a good conductor, will not conduct well when frozen into ice.&quot;

While traveling on a ship, Franklin had observed that the wake of a ship was diminished when the cooks scuttled their greasy water. He studied the effects on a large pond in Clapham Common, London. &quot;I fetched out a cruet of oil and dropt a little of it on the water ... though not more than a teaspoon full, produced an instant calm over a space of several yards square.&quot; He later used the trick to &quot;calm the waters&quot; by carrying &quot;a little oil in the hollow joint of [his] cane.&quot;

===Decision-making===
In a 1772 letter to Joseph Priestley, Franklin laid out the earliest known description of the Pro &amp; Con list, a common decision-making technique, now sometimes called a decisional balance sheet:

==Views on religion, morality, and slavery==

Like the other advocates of republicanism, Franklin emphasized that the new republic could survive only if the people were virtuous. All his life, he explored the role of civic and personal virtue, as expressed in &quot;Poor Richard&#x27;s&quot; aphorisms. He felt that organized religion was necessary to keep men good to their fellow men, but rarely attended religious services himself. When he met Voltaire in Paris and asked his fellow member of the Enlightenment vanguard to bless his grandson, Voltaire said in English, &quot;God and Liberty,&quot; and added, &quot;this is the only appropriate benediction for the grandson of Monsieur Franklin.&quot;

Franklin&#x27;s parents were both pious Puritans. The family attended the Old South Church, the most liberal Puritan congregation in Boston, where Benjamin Franklin was baptized in 1706. Franklin&#x27;s father, a poor chandler, owned a copy of a book, &quot;Bonifacius: Essays to Do Good&quot;, by the Puritan preacher and family friend Cotton Mather, which Franklin often cited as a key influence on his life. &quot;If I have been,&quot; Franklin wrote to Cotton Mather&#x27;s son seventy years later, &quot;a useful citizen, the public owes the advantage of it to that book.&quot; His first pen name, Silence Dogood, paid homage both to the book and to a widely known sermon by Mather. The book preached the importance of forming voluntary associations to benefit society. Franklin learned about forming do-good associations from Mather, but his organizational skills made him the most influential force in making voluntarism an enduring part of the American ethos.

Franklin formulated a presentation of his beliefs and published it in 1728. He no longer accepted the key Puritan ideas regarding salvation, the divinity of Jesus, or indeed much religious dogma. He classified himself as a deist in his 1771 autobiography, although he still considered himself a Christian. He retained a strong faith in a God as the wellspring of morality and goodness in man, and as a Providential actor in history responsible for American independence.

At a critical impasse during the Constitutional Convention in June 1787, he attempted to introduce the practice of daily common prayer with these words:

The motion gained almost no support and was never brought to a vote.

Franklin was an enthusiastic admirer of the evangelical minister George Whitefield during the First Great Awakening. He did not himself subscribe to Whitefield&#x27;s theology, but he admired Whitefield for exhorting people to worship God through good works. He published all of Whitefield&#x27;s sermons and journals, thereby earning a lot of money and boosting the Great Awakening.

When he stopped attending church, Franklin wrote in his autobiography:

Franklin retained a lifelong commitment to the non-religious Puritan virtues and political values he had grown up with, and through his civic work and publishing, he succeeded in passing these values into the American culture permanently. He had a &quot;passion for virtue.&quot; These Puritan values included his devotion to egalitarianism, education, industry, thrift, honesty, temperance, charity and community spirit. Thomas Kidd states, &quot;As an adult, Franklin touted ethical responsibility, industriousness, and benevolence, even as he jettisoned Christian orthodoxy.&quot;

The classical authors read in the Enlightenment period taught an abstract ideal of republican government based on hierarchical social orders of king, aristocracy and commoners. It was widely believed that English liberties relied on their balance of power, but also hierarchal deference to the privileged class. &quot;Puritanism ... and the epidemic evangelism of the mid-eighteenth century, had created challenges to the traditional notions of social stratification&quot; by preaching that the Bible taught all men are equal, that the true value of a man lies in his moral behavior, not his class, and that all men can be saved. Franklin, steeped in Puritanism and an enthusiastic supporter of the evangelical movement, rejected the salvation dogma but embraced the radical notion of egalitarian democracy.

Franklin&#x27;s commitment to teach these values was itself something he gained from his Puritan upbringing, with its stress on &quot;inculcating virtue and character in themselves and their communities.&quot; These Puritan values and the desire to pass them on, were one of his quintessentially American characteristics and helped shape the character of the nation. Max Weber considered Franklin&#x27;s ethical writings a culmination of the Protestant ethic, which ethic created the social conditions necessary for the birth of capitalism.

One of his characteristics was his respect, tolerance and promotion of all churches. Referring to his experience in Philadelphia, he wrote in his autobiography, &quot;new Places of worship were continually wanted, and generally erected by voluntary Contribution, my Mite for such purpose, whatever might be the Sect, was never refused.&quot; &quot;He helped create a new type of nation that would draw strength from its religious pluralism.&quot; The evangelical revivalists who were active mid-century, such as Whitefield, were the greatest advocates of religious freedom, &quot;claiming liberty of conscience to be an &#x27;inalienable right of every rational creature. Whitefield&#x27;s supporters in Philadelphia, including Franklin, erected &quot;a large, new hall, that ... could provide a pulpit to anyone of any belief.&quot; Franklin&#x27;s rejection of dogma and doctrine and his stress on the God of ethics and morality and civic virtue made him the &quot;prophet of tolerance.&quot; He composed &quot;A Parable Against Persecution,&quot; an apocryphal 51st chapter of Genesis in which God teaches Abraham the duty of tolerance. While he was living in London in 1774, he was present at the birth of British Unitarianism, attending the inaugural session of the Essex Street Chapel, at which Theophilus Lindsey drew together the first avowedly Unitarian congregation in England; this was somewhat politically risky and pushed religious tolerance to new boundaries, as a denial of the doctrine of the Trinity was illegal until the 1813 Act.

Although his parents had intended for him a career in the church, Franklin as a young man adopted the Enlightenment religious belief in deism, that God&#x27;s truths can be found entirely through nature and reason, declaring, &quot;I soon became a thorough Deist.&quot; He rejected Christian dogma in a 1725 pamphlet &quot;A Dissertation on Liberty and Necessity, Pleasure and Pain&quot;, which he later saw as an embarrassment, while simultaneously asserting that God is &quot;all wise, all good, all powerful.&quot; He defended his rejection of religious dogma with these words: &quot;I think opinions should be judged by their influences and effects; and if a man holds none that tend to make him less virtuous or more vicious, it may be concluded that he holds none that are dangerous, which I hope is the case with me.&quot; After the disillusioning experience of seeing the decay in his own moral standards, and those of two friends in London whom he had converted to deism, Franklin decided that deism was true but it was not as useful in promoting personal morality as were the controls imposed by organized religion. Ralph Frasca contends that in his later life he can be considered a non-denominational Christian, although he did not believe Christ was divine.

In a major scholarly study of his religion, Thomas Kidd argues that Franklin believed that true religiosity was a matter of personal morality and civic virtue. Kidd says Franklin maintained his lifelong resistance to orthodox Christianity while arriving finally at a &quot;doctrineless, moralized Christianity.&quot; According to David Morgan, Franklin was a proponent of &quot;generic religion.&quot; He prayed to &quot;Powerful Goodness&quot; and referred to God as &quot;the infinite.&quot; John Adams noted that he was a mirror in which people saw their own religion: &quot;The Catholics thought him almost a Catholic. The Church of England claimed him as one of them. The Presbyterians thought him half a Presbyterian, and the Friends believed him a wet Quaker.&quot; Adams himself decided that Franklin best fit among the &quot;Atheists, Deists, and Libertines.&quot; Whatever else Franklin was, concludes Morgan, &quot;he was a true champion of generic religion.&quot; In a letter to Richard Price, Franklin states that he believes religion should support itself without help from the government, claiming, &quot;When a Religion is good, I conceive that it will support itself; and, when it cannot support itself, and God does not take care to support, so that its Professors are oblig&#x27;d to call for the help of the Civil Power, it is a sign, I apprehend, of its being a bad one.&quot;

In 1790, just about a month before he died, Franklin wrote a letter to Ezra Stiles, president of Yale University, who had asked him his views on religion:

On July 4, 1776, Congress appointed a three-member committee composed of Franklin, Jefferson, and Adams to design the Great Seal of the United States. Franklin&#x27;s proposal (which was not adopted) featured the motto: &quot;Rebellion to Tyrants is Obedience to God&quot; and a scene from the Book of Exodus he took from the frontispiece of the Geneva Bible, with Moses, the Israelites, the pillar of fire, and George III depicted as pharaoh.

The design that was produced was not acted upon by Congress, and the Great Seal&#x27;s design was not finalized until a third committee was appointed in 1782.

Franklin strongly supported the right to freedom of speech:

===Thirteen Virtues===

Franklin sought to cultivate his character by a plan of 13 virtues, which he developed at age 20 (in 1726) and continued to practice in some form for the rest of his life. His autobiography lists his 13 virtues as:

# Temperance. Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation.
# Silence. Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling conversation.
# Order. Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time.
# Resolution. Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you resolve.
# Frugality. Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself; i.e., waste nothing.
# Industry. Lose no time; be always employ&#x27;d in something useful; cut off all unnecessary actions.
# Sincerity. Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly, and, if you speak, speak accordingly.
# Justice. Wrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefits that are your duty.
# Moderation. Avoid extremes; forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve.
# Cleanliness. Tolerate no uncleanliness in body, clothes, or habitation.
# Tranquility. Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common or unavoidable.
# Chastity. Rarely use venery but for health or offspring, never to dullness, weakness, or the injury of your own or another&#x27;s peace or reputation.
# Humility. Imitate Jesus and Socrates.

Franklin did not try to work on them all at once. Instead, he worked on only one each week &quot;leaving all others to their ordinary chance.&quot; While he did not adhere completely to the enumerated virtues, and by his own admission he fell short of them many times, he believed the attempt made him a better man, contributing greatly to his success and happiness, which is why in his autobiography, he devoted more pages to this plan than to any other single point and wrote, &quot;I hope, therefore, that some of my descendants may follow the example and reap the benefit.&quot;

===Slavery===
Franklin&#x27;s views and practices concerning slavery evolved over the course of his life. In his early years, Franklin owned seven slaves, including two men who worked in his household and his shop, but in his later years became an adherent of abolition. A revenue stream for his newspaper was paid ads for the sale of slaves and for the capture of runaway slaves and Franklin allowed the sale of slaves in his general store. He later became an outspoken critic of slavery. In 1758, he advocated the opening of a school for the education of black slaves in Philadelphia. He took two slaves to England with him, Peter and King. King escaped with a woman to live in the outskirts of London, and by 1758 he was working for a household in Suffolk. After returning from England in 1762, Franklin became more abolitionist in nature, attacking American slavery. In the wake of &quot;Somerset v Stewart&quot;, he voiced frustration at British abolitionists:

Franklin refused to publicly debate the issue of slavery at the 1787 Constitutional Convention.

At the time of the American founding, there were about half a million slaves in the United States, mostly in the five southernmost states, where they made up 40% of the population. Many of the leading American founderssuch as Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, and James Madisonowned slaves, but many others did not. Benjamin Franklin thought that slavery was &quot;an atrocious debasement of human nature&quot; and &quot;a source of serious evils.&quot; In 1787, Franklin and Benjamin Rush helped write a new constitution for the Pennsylvania Society for Promoting the Abolition of Slavery, and that same year Franklin became president of the organization. In 1790, Quakers from New York and Pennsylvania presented their petition for abolition to Congress. Their argument against slavery was backed by the Pennsylvania Abolitionist Society.

In his later years, as Congress was forced to deal with the issue of slavery, Franklin wrote several essays that stressed the importance of the abolition of slavery and of the integration of African Americans into American society. These writings included:

* &quot;&quot; (1789)
* &quot;&quot; (1789)
* &quot;Sidi Mehemet Ibrahim on the Slave Trade&quot; (1790)

===Vegetarianism===
Franklin became a vegetarian when he was a teenager apprenticing at a print shop, after coming upon a book by the early vegetarian advocate Thomas Tryon. In addition, he would have also been familiar with the moral arguments espoused by prominent vegetarian Quakers in the colonial-era Province of Pennsylvania, including Benjamin Lay and John Woolman. His reasons for vegetarianism were based on health, ethics, and economy:

Franklin also declared the consumption of fish to be &quot;unprovoked murder.&quot; Despite his convictions, he began to eat fish after being tempted by fried cod on a boat sailing from Boston, justifying the eating of animals by observing that the fish&#x27;s stomach contained other fish. Nonetheless, he recognized the faulty ethics in this argument and would continue to be a vegetarian on and off. He was &quot;excited&quot; by tofu, which he learned of from the writings of a Spanish missionary to Southeast Asia, Domingo Fernández Navarrete. Franklin sent a sample of soybeans to prominent American botanist John Bartram and had previously written to British diplomat and Chinese trade expert James Flint inquiring as to how tofu was made, with their correspondence believed to be the first documented use of the word &quot;tofu&quot; in the English language.

Franklin&#x27;s &quot;Second Reply to &quot;Vindex Patriae,&quot;&quot; a 1766 letter advocating self-sufficiency and less dependence on England, lists various examples of the bounty of American agricultural products, and does not mention meat. Detailing new American customs, he wrote that, &quot;[t]hey resolved last spring to eat no more lamb; and not a joint of lamb has since been seen on any of their tables ... the sweet little creatures are all alive to this day, with the prettiest fleeces on their backs imaginable.&quot;

===View on inoculation===
The concept of preventing smallpox by variolation was introduced to colonial America by an African slave named Onesimus via his owner Cotton Mather in the early eighteenth century, but the procedure was not immediately accepted. James Franklin&#x27;s newspaper carried articles in 1721 that vigorously denounced the concept.

However, by 1736 Benjamin Franklin was known as a supporter of the procedure. Therefore, when four-year-old &quot;Franky&quot; died of smallpox, opponents of the procedure circulated rumors that the child had been inoculated, and that this was the cause of his subsequent death. When Franklin became aware of this gossip, he placed a notice in the &quot;Pennsylvania Gazette&quot;, stating: &quot;I do hereby sincerely declare, that he was not inoculated, but receiv&#x27;d the Distemper in the common Way of Infection ... I intended to have my Child inoculated.&quot; The child had a bad case of flux diarrhea, and his parents had waited for him to get well before having him inoculated. Franklin wrote in his &quot;Autobiography&quot;: &quot;In 1736 I lost one of my sons, a fine boy of four years old, by the small-pox, taken in the common way. I long regretted bitterly, and still regret that I had not given it to him by inoculation. This I mention for the sake of parents who omit that operation, on the supposition that they should never forgive themselves if a child died under it; my example showing that the regret may be the same either way, and that, therefore, the safer should be chosen.&quot;

==Interests and activities==
===Musical endeavors===

Franklin is known to have played the violin, the harp, and the guitar. He also composed music, which included a string quartet in early classical style. While he was in London, he developed a much-improved version of the glass harmonica, in which the glasses rotate on a shaft, with the player&#x27;s fingers held steady, instead of the other way around. He worked with the London glassblower Charles James to create it, and instruments based on his mechanical version soon found their way to other parts of Europe. Joseph Haydn, a fan of Franklin&#x27;s enlightened ideas, had a glass harmonica in his instrument collection. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart composed for Franklin&#x27;s glass harmonica, as did Beethoven. Gaetano Donizetti used the instrument in the accompaniment to Amelia&#x27;s aria &quot;Par che mi dica ancora&quot; in the tragic opera &quot;Il castello di Kenilworth&quot; (1821), as did Camille Saint-Saëns in his 1886 &quot;The Carnival of the Animals&quot;. Richard Strauss calls for the glass harmonica in his 1917 &quot;Die Frau ohne Schatten&quot;, and numerous other composers used Franklin&#x27;s instrument as well.

===Chess===
Franklin was an avid chess player. He was playing chess by around 1733, making him the first chess player known by name in the American colonies. His essay on &quot;The Morals of Chess&quot; in &quot;Columbian Magazine&quot; in December 1786 is the second known writing on chess in America. This essay in praise of chess and prescribing a code of behavior for the game has been widely reprinted and translated. He and a friend used chess as a means of learning the Italian language, which both were studying; the winner of each game between them had the right to assign a task, such as parts of the Italian grammar to be learned by heart, to be performed by the loser before their next meeting.

Franklin was able to play chess more frequently against stronger opposition during his many years as a civil servant and diplomat in England, where the game was far better established than in America. He was able to improve his playing standard by facing more experienced players during this period. He regularly attended Old Slaughter&#x27;s Coffee House in London for chess and socializing, making many important personal contacts. While in Paris, both as a visitor and later as ambassador, he visited the famous Café de la Régence, which France&#x27;s strongest players made their regular meeting place. No records of his games have survived, so it is not possible to ascertain his playing strength in modern terms.

Franklin was inducted into the U.S. Chess Hall of Fame in 1999. The Franklin Mercantile Chess Club in Philadelphia, the second oldest chess club in the U.S., is named in his honor.

==Legacy==

===Bequest===
Franklin bequeathed £1,000 (about $4,400 at the time, or about $125,000 in 2021 dollars) each to the cities of Boston and Philadelphia, in trust to gather interest for 200 years. The trust began in 1785 when the French mathematician Charles-Joseph Mathon de la Cour, who admired Franklin greatly, wrote a friendly parody of Franklin&#x27;s &quot;Poor Richard&#x27;s Almanack&quot; called &quot;Fortunate Richard&quot;. The main character leaves a smallish amount of money in his will, five lots of 100 &quot;livres&quot;, to collect interest over one, two, three, four or five full centuries, with the resulting astronomical sums to be spent on impossibly elaborate utopian projects. Franklin, who was 79 years old at the time, wrote thanking him for a great idea and telling him that he had decided to leave a bequest of 1,000 pounds each to his native Boston and his adopted Philadelphia.

By 1990, more than $2,000,000 (~$ in ) had accumulated in Franklin&#x27;s Philadelphia trust, which had loaned the money to local residents. From 1940 to 1990, the money was used mostly for mortgage loans. When the trust came due, Philadelphia decided to spend it on scholarships for local high school students. Franklin&#x27;s Boston trust fund accumulated almost $5,000,000 during that same time; at the end of its first 100 years a portion was allocated to help establish a trade school that became the Franklin Institute of Boston, and the entire fund was later dedicated to supporting this institute.

In 1787, a group of prominent ministers in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, proposed the foundation of a new college named in Franklin&#x27;s honor. Franklin donated £200 towards the development of Franklin College (now called Franklin &amp; Marshall College).

=== Likeness and image ===
As the only person to have signed the Declaration of Independence in 1776, Treaty of Alliance with France in 1778, Treaty of Paris in 1783, and U.S. Constitution in 1787, Franklin is considered one of the leading Founding Fathers of the United States. His pervasive influence in the early history of the nation has led to his being jocularly called &quot;the only president of the United States who was never president of the United States.&quot;

Franklin&#x27;s likeness is ubiquitous. Since 1914, it has adorned American $100 bills. From 1948 to 1963, Franklin&#x27;s portrait was on the half-dollar. He has appeared on a $50 bill and on several varieties of the $100 bill from 1914 and 1918. Franklin also appears on the $1,000 Series EE savings bond.

On April 12, 1976, as part of a bicentennial celebration, Congress dedicated a tall marble statue in Philadelphia&#x27;s Franklin Institute as the Benjamin Franklin National Memorial. Vice President Nelson Rockefeller presided over the dedication ceremony. Many of Franklin&#x27;s personal possessions are on display at the institute. In London, his house at 36 Craven Street, which is the only surviving former residence of Franklin, was first marked with a blue plaque and has since been opened to the public as the Benjamin Franklin House. In 1998, workmen restoring the building dug up the remains of six children and four adults hidden below the home. A total of 15 bodies have been recovered. The Friends of Benjamin Franklin House (the organization responsible for the restoration) note that the bones were likely placed there by William Hewson, who lived in the house for two years and who had built a small anatomy school at the back of the house. They note that while Franklin likely knew what Hewson was doing, he probably did not participate in any dissections because he was much more of a physicist than a medical man.

He has been honored on U.S. postage stamps many times. The image of Franklin, the first postmaster general of the United States, occurs on the face of U.S. postage more than any other American save that of George Washington. He appeared on the first U.S. postage stamp issued in 1847. From 1908 through 1923, the U.S. Post Office issued a series of postage stamps commonly referred to as the Washington–Franklin Issues, in which Washington and Franklin were depicted many times over a 14-year period, the longest run of any one series in U.S. postal history. However, he only appears on a few commemorative stamps. Some of the finest portrayals of Franklin on record can be found on the engravings inscribed on the face of U.S. postage.

<text>In mathematics, more specifically in functional analysis, a Banach space (, ) is a complete normed vector space. Thus, a Banach space is a vector space with a metric that allows the computation of vector length and distance between vectors and is complete in the sense that a Cauchy sequence of vectors always converges to a well-defined limit that is within the space.

Banach spaces are named after the Polish mathematician Stefan Banach, who introduced this concept and studied it systematically in 1920–1922 along with Hans Hahn and Eduard Helly. 
Maurice René Fréchet was the first to use the term &quot;Banach space&quot; and Banach in turn then coined the term &quot;Fréchet space&quot;.
Banach spaces originally grew out of the study of function spaces by Hilbert, Fréchet, and Riesz earlier in the century. Banach spaces play a central role in functional analysis. In other areas of analysis, the spaces under study are often Banach spaces.

==Definition==

A Banach space is a complete normed space formula_1 
A normed space is a pair 
formula_2 consisting of a vector space formula_3 over a scalar field formula_4 (where formula_4 is commonly formula_6 or formula_7) together with a distinguished 
norm formula_8 Like all norms, this norm induces a translation invariant 
distance function, called the &quot;canonical&quot; or &quot;(norm) induced metric&quot;, defined for all vectors formula_9 by
formula_10
This makes formula_3 into a metric space formula_12 
A sequence formula_13 is called or or if for every real formula_14 there exists some index formula_15 such that
formula_16
whenever formula_17 and formula_18 are greater than formula_19 
The normed space formula_2 is called a Banach space and the canonical metric formula_21 is called a &quot;complete metric&quot; if formula_22 is a complete metric space, which by definition means for every Cauchy sequence formula_13 in formula_24 there exists some formula_25 such that
formula_26
where because formula_27 this sequence&#x27;s convergence to formula_28 can equivalently be expressed as
formula_29

The norm formula_30 of a normed space formula_2 is called a if formula_2 is a Banach space.

=== L-semi-inner product ===

For any normed space formula_33 there exists an L-semi-inner product formula_34 on formula_3 such that formula_36 for all formula_37 In general, there may be infinitely many L-semi-inner products that satisfy this condition. L-semi-inner products are a generalization of inner products, which are what fundamentally distinguish Hilbert spaces from all other Banach spaces. This shows that all normed spaces (and hence all Banach spaces) can be considered as being generalizations of (pre-)Hilbert spaces.

=== Characterization in terms of series ===

The vector space structure allows one to relate the behavior of Cauchy sequences to that of converging series of vectors. 
A normed space formula_3 is a Banach space if and only if each absolutely convergent series in formula_3 converges to a value that lies within formula_40 symbolically
formula_41

===Topology===

The canonical metric formula_21 of a normed space formula_2 induces the usual metric topology formula_44 on formula_40 which is referred to as the &quot;canonical&quot; or &quot;norm induced topology&quot;. 
Every normed space is automatically assumed to carry this Hausdorff topology, unless indicated otherwise. 
With this topology, every Banach space is a Baire space, although there exist normed spaces that are Baire but not Banach. The norm formula_46 is always a continuous function with respect to the topology that it induces.

The open and closed balls of radius formula_47 centered at a point formula_25 are, respectively, the sets 
formula_49 
Any such ball is a convex and bounded subset of formula_40 but a compact ball/neighborhood exists if and only if formula_3 is finite-dimensional.
In particular, no infinite–dimensional normed space can be locally compact or have the Heine–Borel property. 
If formula_52 is a vector and formula_53 is a scalar, then 
formula_54 
Using formula_55 shows that the norm-induced topology is translation invariant, which means that for any formula_25 and formula_57 the subset formula_58 is open (respectively, closed) in formula_3 if and only if its translation formula_60 is open (respectively, closed).
Consequently, the norm induced topology is completely determined by any neighbourhood basis at the origin. Some common neighborhood bases at the origin include
formula_61
where formula_62 can be any sequence of positive real numbers that converges to formula_63 in formula_64 (common choices are formula_65 or formula_66). 
So, for example, any open subset formula_67 of formula_3 can be written as a union 
formula_69
indexed by some subset formula_70 where each formula_71 may be chosen from the aforementioned sequence formula_72 (The open balls can also be replaced with closed balls, although the indexing set formula_73 and radii formula_71 may then also need to be replaced). 
Additionally, formula_73 can always be chosen to be countable if formula_3 is a , which by definition means that formula_3 contains some countable dense subset. 

====Homeomorphism classes of separable Banach spaces====

All finite–dimensional normed spaces are separable Banach spaces and any two Banach spaces of the same finite dimension are linearly homeomorphic. 
Every separable infinite–dimensional Hilbert space is linearly isometrically isomorphic to the separable Hilbert sequence space formula_78 with its usual norm formula_79 

The Anderson–Kadec theorem states that every infinite–dimensional separable Fréchet space is homeomorphic to the product space formula_80 of countably many copies of formula_6 (this homeomorphism need not be a linear map). 
Thus all infinite–dimensional separable Fréchet spaces are homeomorphic to each other (or said differently, their topology is unique up to a homeomorphism). 
Since every Banach space is a Fréchet space, this is also true of all infinite–dimensional separable Banach spaces, including formula_82 
In fact, formula_78 is even homeomorphic to its own unit formula_84 which stands in sharp contrast to finite–dimensional spaces (the Euclidean plane formula_85 is not homeomorphic to the unit circle, for instance). 

This pattern in homeomorphism classes extends to generalizations of metrizable (locally Euclidean) topological manifolds known as , which are metric spaces that are around every point, locally homeomorphic to some open subset of a given Banach space (metric Hilbert manifolds and metric Fréchet manifolds are defined similarly). 
For example, every open subset formula_67 of a Banach space formula_3 is canonically a metric Banach manifold modeled on formula_3 since the inclusion map formula_89 is an open local homeomorphism. 
Using Hilbert space microbundles, David Henderson showed in 1969 that every metric manifold modeled on a separable infinite–dimensional Banach (or Fréchet) space can be topologically embedded as an subset of formula_78 and, consequently, also admits a unique smooth structure making it into a formula_91 Hilbert manifold. 

====Compact and convex subsets====

There is a compact subset formula_58 of formula_78 whose convex hull formula_94 is closed and thus also compact. 
However, like in all Banach spaces, the convex hull formula_95 of this (and every other) compact subset will be compact. In a normed space that is not complete then it is in general guaranteed that formula_95 will be compact whenever formula_58 is; an example can even be found in a (non-complete) pre-Hilbert vector subspace of formula_82

====As a topological vector space====

This norm-induced topology also makes formula_99 into what is known as a topological vector space (TVS), which by definition is a vector space endowed with a topology making the operations of addition and scalar multiplication continuous. It is emphasized that the TVS formula_99 is a vector space together with a certain type of topology; that is to say, when considered as a TVS, it is associated with particular norm or metric (both of which are &quot;forgotten&quot;). This Hausdorff TVS formula_99 is even locally convex because the set of all open balls centered at the origin forms a neighbourhood basis at the origin consisting of convex balanced open sets. This TVS is also , which by definition refers to any TVS whose topology is induced by some (possibly unknown) norm. Normable TVSs are characterized by being Hausdorff and having a bounded convex neighborhood of the origin. 
All Banach spaces are barrelled spaces, which means that every barrel is neighborhood of the origin (all closed balls centered at the origin are barrels, for example) and guarantees that the Banach–Steinhaus theorem holds. 

====Comparison of complete metrizable vector topologies====

The open mapping theorem implies that when formula_102 and formula_103 are topologies on formula_3 that make both formula_105 and formula_106 into complete metrizable TVSes (for example, Banach or Fréchet spaces), if one topology is finer or coarser than the other, then they must be equal (that is, if formula_107 or formula_108 then formula_109).
So, for example, if formula_110 and formula_111 are Banach spaces with topologies formula_112 and formula_113 and if one of these spaces has some open ball that is also an open subset of the other space (or, equivalently, if one of formula_114 or formula_115 is continuous), then their topologies are identical and the norms formula_116 and formula_117 are equivalent.

===Completeness===

====Complete norms and equivalent norms====

Two norms, formula_116 and formula_119 on a vector space formula_3 are said to be &quot;equivalent&quot; if they induce the same topology; this happens if and only if there exist real numbers formula_121 such that formula_122 for all formula_37 If formula_116 and formula_117 are two equivalent norms on a vector space formula_3 then formula_110 is a Banach space if and only if formula_111 is a Banach space.
See this footnote for an example of a continuous norm on a Banach space that is equivalent to that Banach space&#x27;s given norm. 
All norms on a finite-dimensional vector space are equivalent and every finite-dimensional normed space is a Banach space.

====Complete norms vs complete metrics====

A metric formula_129 on a vector space formula_3 is induced by a norm on formula_3 if and only if formula_129 is translation invariant and &quot;absolutely homogeneous&quot;, which means that formula_133 for all scalars formula_134 and all formula_135 in which case the function formula_136 defines a norm on formula_3 and the canonical metric induced by formula_30 is equal to formula_139

Suppose that formula_2 is a normed space and that formula_141 is the norm topology induced on formula_142 Suppose that formula_129 is metric on formula_3 such that the topology that formula_129 induces on formula_3 is equal to formula_147 If formula_129 is translation invariant then formula_2 is a Banach space if and only if formula_150 is a complete metric space. 
If formula_129 is translation invariant, then it may be possible for formula_2 to be a Banach space but for formula_150 to be a complete metric space (see this footnote for an example). In contrast, a theorem of Klee, which also applies to all metrizable topological vector spaces, implies that if there exists complete metric formula_129 on formula_3 that induces the norm topology formula_141 on formula_40 then formula_2 is a Banach space.

A Fréchet space is a locally convex topological vector space whose topology is induced by some translation-invariant complete metric. 
Every Banach space is a Fréchet space but not conversely; indeed, there even exist Fréchet spaces on which no norm is a continuous function (such as the space of real sequences formula_159 with the product topology). 
However, the topology of every Fréchet space is induced by some countable family of real-valued (necessarily continuous) maps called seminorms, which are generalizations of norms. 
It is even possible for a Fréchet space to have a topology that is induced by a countable family of (such norms would necessarily be continuous) 
but to not be a Banach/normable space because its topology can not be defined by any norm. 
An example of such a space is the Fréchet space formula_160 whose definition can be found in the article on spaces of test functions and distributions.

====Complete norms vs complete topological vector spaces====

There is another notion of completeness besides metric completeness and that is the notion of a complete topological vector space (TVS) or TVS-completeness, which uses the theory of uniform spaces. 
Specifically, the notion of TVS-completeness uses a unique translation-invariant uniformity, called the canonical uniformity, that depends on vector subtraction and the topology formula_141 that the vector space is endowed with, and so in particular, this notion of TVS completeness is independent of whatever norm induced the topology formula_141 (and even applies to TVSs that are even metrizable). 
Every Banach space is a complete TVS. Moreover, a normed space is a Banach space (that is, its norm-induced metric is complete) if and only if it is complete as a topological vector space. 
If formula_163 is a metrizable topological vector space (such as any norm induced topology, for example), then formula_163 is a complete TVS if and only if it is a complete TVS, meaning that it is enough to check that every Cauchy in formula_163 converges in formula_163 to some point of formula_3 (that is, there is no need to consider the more general notion of arbitrary Cauchy nets).

If formula_163 is a topological vector space whose topology is induced by (possibly unknown) norm (such spaces are called ), then formula_163 is a complete topological vector space if and only if formula_3 may be assigned a norm formula_30 that induces on formula_3 the topology formula_141 and also makes formula_2 into a Banach space. 
A Hausdorff locally convex topological vector space formula_3 is normable if and only if its strong dual space formula_176 is normable, in which case formula_176 is a Banach space (formula_176 denotes the strong dual space of formula_40 whose topology is a generalization of the dual norm-induced topology on the continuous dual space formula_180; see this footnote for more details). 
If formula_3 is a metrizable locally convex TVS, then formula_3 is normable if and only if formula_176 is a Fréchet–Urysohn space. 
This shows that in the category of locally convex TVSs, Banach spaces are exactly those complete spaces that are both metrizable and have metrizable strong dual spaces.

====Completions====

Every normed space can be isometrically embedded onto a dense vector subspace of a Banach space, where this Banach space is called a &quot;completion&quot; of the normed space. This Hausdorff completion is unique up to isometric isomorphism.

More precisely, for every normed space formula_40 there exists a Banach space formula_185 and a mapping formula_186 such that formula_187 is an isometric mapping and formula_188 is dense in formula_189 If formula_190 is another Banach space such that there is an isometric isomorphism from formula_3 onto a dense subset of formula_192 then formula_190 is isometrically isomorphic to formula_189
The Banach space formula_185 is the Hausdorff &quot;completion&quot; of the normed space formula_142 The underlying metric space for formula_185 is the same as the metric completion of formula_40 with the vector space operations extended from formula_3 to formula_189 The completion of formula_3 is sometimes denoted by formula_202

==General theory==

===Linear operators, isomorphisms===
If formula_3 and formula_185 are normed spaces over the same ground field formula_205 the set of all continuous formula_4-linear maps formula_186 is denoted by formula_208 In infinite-dimensional spaces, not all linear maps are continuous. A linear mapping from a normed space formula_3 to another normed space is continuous if and only if it is bounded on the closed unit ball of formula_142 Thus, the vector space formula_211 can be given the operator norm
formula_212

For formula_185 a Banach space, the space formula_211 is a Banach space with respect to this norm. In categorical contexts, it is sometimes convenient to restrict the function space between two Banach spaces to only the short maps; in that case the space formula_215 reappears as a natural bifunctor.

If formula_3 is a Banach space, the space formula_217 forms a unital Banach algebra; the multiplication operation is given by the composition of linear maps.

If formula_3 and formula_185 are normed spaces, they are isomorphic normed spaces if there exists a linear bijection formula_186 such that formula_187 and its inverse formula_222 are continuous. If one of the two spaces formula_3 or formula_185 is complete (or reflexive, separable, etc.) then so is the other space. Two normed spaces formula_3 and formula_185 are &quot;isometrically isomorphic&quot; if in addition, formula_187 is an isometry, that is, formula_228 for every formula_28 in formula_142 The Banach–Mazur distance formula_231 between two isomorphic but not isometric spaces formula_3 and formula_185 gives a measure of how much the two spaces formula_3 and formula_185 differ.

====Continuous and bounded linear functions and seminorms====
Every continuous linear operator is a bounded linear operator and if dealing only with normed spaces then the converse is also true. That is, a linear operator between two normed spaces is bounded if and only if it is a continuous function. So in particular, because the scalar field (which is formula_64 or formula_7) is a normed space, a linear functional on a normed space is a bounded linear functional if and only if it is a continuous linear functional. This allows for continuity-related results (like those below) to be applied to Banach spaces. Although boundedness is the same as continuity for linear maps between normed spaces, the term &quot;bounded&quot; is more commonly used when dealing primarily with Banach spaces.

If formula_238 is a subadditive function (such as a norm, a sublinear function, or real linear functional), then formula_239 is continuous at the origin if and only if formula_239 is uniformly continuous on all of formula_3; and if in addition formula_242 then formula_239 is continuous if and only if its absolute value formula_244 is continuous, which happens if and only if formula_245 is an open subset of formula_142 
And very importantly for applying the Hahn–Banach theorem, a linear functional formula_239 is continuous if and only if this is true of its real part formula_248 and moreover, formula_249 and the real part formula_248 completely determines formula_251 which is why the Hahn–Banach theorem is often stated only for real linear functionals.
Also, a linear functional formula_239 on formula_3 is continuous if and only if the seminorm formula_254 is continuous, which happens if and only if there exists a continuous seminorm formula_255 such that formula_256; this last statement involving the linear functional formula_239 and seminorm formula_116 is encountered in many versions of the Hahn–Banach theorem.

===Basic notions===

The Cartesian product formula_259 of two normed spaces is not canonically equipped with a norm. However, several equivalent norms are commonly used, such as
formula_260
which correspond (respectively) to the coproduct and product in the category of Banach spaces and short maps (discussed above). For finite (co)products, these norms give rise to isomorphic normed spaces, and the product formula_259 (or the direct sum formula_262) is complete if and only if the two factors are complete.

If formula_263 is a closed linear subspace of a normed space formula_40 there is a natural norm on the quotient space formula_265
formula_266

The quotient formula_267 is a Banach space when formula_3 is complete. The quotient map from formula_3 onto formula_265 sending formula_25 to its class formula_272 is linear, onto, and of norm formula_273 except when formula_274 in which case the quotient is the null space.

The closed linear subspace formula_263 of formula_3 is said to be a &quot;complemented subspace&quot; of formula_3 if formula_263 is the range of a surjective bounded linear projection formula_279 In this case, the space formula_3 is isomorphic to the direct sum of formula_263 and formula_282 the kernel of the projection formula_283

Suppose that formula_3 and formula_185 are Banach spaces and that formula_286 There exists a canonical factorization of formula_187 as
formula_288
where the first map formula_289 is the quotient map, and the second map formula_290 sends every class formula_291 in the quotient to the image formula_292 in formula_189 This is well defined because all elements in the same class have the same image. The mapping formula_290 is a linear bijection from formula_295 onto the range formula_296 whose inverse need not be bounded.

===Classical spaces===

Basic examples of Banach spaces include: the Lp spaces formula_297 and their special cases, the sequence spaces formula_298 that consist of scalar sequences indexed by natural numbers formula_299; among them, the space formula_300 of absolutely summable sequences and the space formula_301 of square summable sequences; the space formula_302 of sequences tending to zero and the space formula_303 of bounded sequences; the space formula_304 of continuous scalar functions on a compact Hausdorff space formula_305 equipped with the max norm,
formula_306

According to the Banach–Mazur theorem, every Banach space is isometrically isomorphic to a subspace of some formula_307 For every separable Banach space formula_40 there is a closed subspace formula_263 of formula_300 such that formula_311

Any Hilbert space serves as an example of a Banach space. A Hilbert space formula_312 on formula_313 is complete for a norm of the form
formula_314
where
formula_315
is the inner product, linear in its first argument that satisfies the following:
formula_316

For example, the space formula_317 is a Hilbert space.

The Hardy spaces, the Sobolev spaces are examples of Banach spaces that are related to formula_297 spaces and have additional structure. They are important in different branches of analysis, Harmonic analysis and Partial differential equations among others.

===Banach algebras===

A &quot;Banach algebra&quot; is a Banach space formula_319 over formula_320 or formula_321 together with a structure of algebra over formula_4, such that the product map formula_323 is continuous. An equivalent norm on formula_319 can be found so that formula_325 for all formula_326

====Examples====

* The Banach space formula_304 with the pointwise product, is a Banach algebra.
* The disk algebra formula_328 consists of functions holomorphic in the open unit disk formula_329 and continuous on its closure: formula_330 Equipped with the max norm on formula_331 the disk algebra formula_328 is a closed subalgebra of formula_333
* The Wiener algebra formula_334 is the algebra of functions on the unit circle formula_335 with absolutely convergent Fourier series. Via the map associating a function on formula_335 to the sequence of its Fourier coefficients, this algebra is isomorphic to the Banach algebra formula_337 where the product is the convolution of sequences.
* For every Banach space formula_40 the space formula_339 of bounded linear operators on formula_40 with the composition of maps as product, is a Banach algebra.
* A C*-algebra is a complex Banach algebra formula_319 with an antilinear involution formula_342 such that formula_343 The space formula_344 of bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space formula_312 is a fundamental example of C*-algebra. The Gelfand–Naimark theorem states that every C*-algebra is isometrically isomorphic to a C*-subalgebra of some formula_346 The space formula_304 of complex continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space formula_348 is an example of commutative C*-algebra, where the involution associates to every function formula_239 its complex conjugate formula_350

===Dual space===

If formula_3 is a normed space and formula_4 the underlying field (either the reals or the complex numbers), the &quot;continuous dual space&quot; is the space of continuous linear maps from formula_3 into formula_205 or &quot;continuous linear functionals&quot;.
The notation for the continuous dual is formula_355 in this article. 
Since formula_4 is a Banach space (using the absolute value as norm), the dual formula_180 is a Banach space, for every normed space formula_142 The Dixmier–Ng theorem characterizes the dual spaces of Banach spaces.

The main tool for proving the existence of continuous linear functionals is the Hahn–Banach theorem.

In particular, every continuous linear functional on a subspace of a normed space can be continuously extended to the whole space, without increasing the norm of the functional. 
An important special case is the following: for every vector formula_28 in a normed space formula_40 there exists a continuous linear functional formula_239 on formula_3 such that
formula_363

When formula_28 is not equal to the formula_365 vector, the functional formula_239 must have norm one, and is called a &quot;norming functional&quot; for formula_367

The Hahn–Banach separation theorem states that two disjoint non-empty convex sets in a real Banach space, one of them open, can be separated by a closed affine hyperplane. 
The open convex set lies strictly on one side of the hyperplane, the second convex set lies on the other side but may touch the hyperplane.

A subset formula_58 in a Banach space formula_3 is &quot;total&quot; if the linear span of formula_58 is dense in formula_142 The subset formula_58 is total in formula_3 if and only if the only continuous linear functional that vanishes on formula_58 is the formula_365 functional: this equivalence follows from the Hahn–Banach theorem.

If formula_3 is the direct sum of two closed linear subspaces formula_263 and formula_378 then the dual formula_180 of formula_3 is isomorphic to the direct sum of the duals of formula_263 and formula_19 
If formula_263 is a closed linear subspace in formula_40 one can associate the formula_263 in the dual,
formula_386

The orthogonal formula_387 is a closed linear subspace of the dual. The dual of formula_263 is isometrically isomorphic to formula_389 
The dual of formula_267 is isometrically isomorphic to formula_391

The dual of a separable Banach space need not be separable, but:

When formula_180 is separable, the above criterion for totality can be used for proving the existence of a countable total subset in formula_142

====Weak topologies====

The &quot;weak topology&quot; on a Banach space formula_3 is the coarsest topology on formula_3 for which all elements formula_396 in the continuous dual space formula_180 are continuous. 
The norm topology is therefore finer than the weak topology. 
It follows from the Hahn–Banach separation theorem that the weak topology is Hausdorff, and that a norm-closed convex subset of a Banach space is also weakly closed. 
A norm-continuous linear map between two Banach spaces formula_3 and formula_185 is also &quot;weakly continuous&quot;, that is, continuous from the weak topology of formula_3 to that of formula_189

If formula_3 is infinite-dimensional, there exist linear maps which are not continuous. The space formula_403 of all linear maps from formula_3 to the underlying field formula_4 (this space formula_403 is called the algebraic dual space, to distinguish it from formula_180 also induces a topology on formula_3 which is finer than the weak topology, and much less used in functional analysis.

On a dual space formula_409 there is a topology weaker than the weak topology of formula_409 called the &quot;weak* topology&quot;. 
It is the coarsest topology on formula_180 for which all evaluation maps formula_412 where formula_28 ranges over formula_40 are continuous. 
Its importance comes from the Banach–Alaoglu theorem.

The Banach–Alaoglu theorem can be proved using Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem about infinite products of compact Hausdorff spaces. 
When formula_3 is separable, the unit ball formula_416 of the dual is a metrizable compact in the weak* topology.

====Examples of dual spaces====

The dual of formula_302 is isometrically isomorphic to formula_300: for every bounded linear functional formula_239 on formula_420 there is a unique element formula_421 such that
formula_422

The dual of formula_300 is isometrically isomorphic to formula_303. 
The dual of Lebesgue space formula_425 is isometrically isomorphic to formula_426 when formula_427 and formula_428

For every vector formula_429 in a Hilbert space formula_430 the mapping
formula_431

defines a continuous linear functional formula_432 on formula_433The Riesz representation theorem states that every continuous linear functional on formula_312 is of the form formula_432 for a uniquely defined vector formula_429 in formula_433
The mapping formula_438 is an antilinear isometric bijection from formula_312 onto its dual formula_440 
When the scalars are real, this map is an isometric isomorphism.

When formula_348 is a compact Hausdorff topological space, the dual formula_442 of formula_304 is the space of Radon measures in the sense of Bourbaki. 
The subset formula_444 of formula_442 consisting of non-negative measures of mass 1 (probability measures) is a convex w*-closed subset of the unit ball of formula_446 
The extreme points of formula_444 are the Dirac measures on formula_448 
The set of Dirac measures on formula_305 equipped with the w*-topology, is homeomorphic to formula_448

The result has been extended by Amir and Cambern to the case when the multiplicative Banach–Mazur distance between formula_304 and formula_452 is formula_453 
The theorem is no longer true when the distance is formula_454

In the commutative Banach algebra formula_455 the maximal ideals are precisely kernels of Dirac measures on formula_305
formula_457

More generally, by the Gelfand–Mazur theorem, the maximal ideals of a unital commutative Banach algebra can be identified with its characters—not merely as sets but as topological spaces: the former with the hull-kernel topology and the latter with the w*-topology. 
In this identification, the maximal ideal space can be viewed as a w*-compact subset of the unit ball in the dual formula_458

Not every unital commutative Banach algebra is of the form formula_304 for some compact Hausdorff space formula_448 However, this statement holds if one places formula_304 in the smaller category of commutative C*-algebras. 
Gelfand&#x27;s representation theorem for commutative C*-algebras states that every commutative unital &quot;C&quot;*-algebra formula_319 is isometrically isomorphic to a formula_304 space. 
The Hausdorff compact space formula_348 here is again the maximal ideal space, also called the spectrum of formula_319 in the C*-algebra context.

====Bidual====
If formula_3 is a normed space, the (continuous) dual formula_467 of the dual formula_180 is called the &#x27; or &#x27; of formula_142 
For every normed space formula_40 there is a natural map,
formula_471

This defines formula_472 as a continuous linear functional on formula_409 that is, an element of formula_474 The map formula_475 is a linear map from formula_3 to formula_474 
As a consequence of the existence of a norming functional formula_239 for every formula_479 this map formula_480 is isometric, thus injective.

For example, the dual of formula_481 is identified with formula_482 and the dual of formula_300 is identified with formula_484 the space of bounded scalar sequences. 
Under these identifications, formula_480 is the inclusion map from formula_302 to formula_487 It is indeed isometric, but not onto.

If formula_480 is surjective, then the normed space formula_3 is called &quot;reflexive&quot; (see below). 
Being the dual of a normed space, the bidual formula_467 is complete, therefore, every reflexive normed space is a Banach space.

Using the isometric embedding formula_491 it is customary to consider a normed space formula_3 as a subset of its bidual. 
When formula_3 is a Banach space, it is viewed as a closed linear subspace of formula_474 If formula_3 is not reflexive, the unit ball of formula_3 is a proper subset of the unit ball of formula_474 
The Goldstine theorem states that the unit ball of a normed space is weakly*-dense in the unit ball of the bidual. 
In other words, for every formula_498 in the bidual, there exists a net formula_499 in formula_3 so that
formula_501

The net may be replaced by a weakly*-convergent sequence when the dual formula_180 is separable. 
On the other hand, elements of the bidual of formula_300 that are not in formula_300 cannot be weak*-limit of in formula_482 since formula_300 is weakly sequentially complete.

===Banach&#x27;s theorems===

Here are the main general results about Banach spaces that go back to the time of Banach&#x27;s book () and are related to the Baire category theorem. 
According to this theorem, a complete metric space (such as a Banach space, a Fréchet space or an F-space) cannot be equal to a union of countably many closed subsets with empty interiors. 
Therefore, a Banach space cannot be the union of countably many closed subspaces, unless it is already equal to one of them; a Banach space with a countable Hamel basis is finite-dimensional.

The Banach–Steinhaus theorem is not limited to Banach spaces. 
It can be extended for example to the case where formula_3 is a Fréchet space, provided the conclusion is modified as follows: under the same hypothesis, there exists a neighborhood formula_67 of formula_365 in formula_3 such that all formula_187 in formula_512 are uniformly bounded on formula_513
formula_514



This result is a direct consequence of the preceding &quot;Banach isomorphism theorem&quot; and of the canonical factorization of bounded linear maps.

This is another consequence of Banach&#x27;s isomorphism theorem, applied to the continuous bijection from formula_515 onto formula_3 sending formula_517 to the sum formula_518

===Reflexivity===
The normed space formula_3 is called &quot;reflexive&quot; when the natural map
formula_520
is surjective. Reflexive normed spaces are Banach spaces.

This is a consequence of the Hahn–Banach theorem. 
Further, by the open mapping theorem, if there is a bounded linear operator from the Banach space formula_3 onto the Banach space formula_522 then formula_185 is reflexive.

Indeed, if the dual formula_524 of a Banach space formula_185 is separable, then formula_185 is separable. 
If formula_3 is reflexive and separable, then the dual of formula_180 is separable, so formula_180 is separable.

Hilbert spaces are reflexive. The formula_297 spaces are reflexive when formula_531 More generally, uniformly convex spaces are reflexive, by the Milman–Pettis theorem. 
The spaces formula_532 are not reflexive. 
In these examples of non-reflexive spaces formula_40 the bidual formula_467 is &quot;much larger&quot; than formula_142 
Namely, under the natural isometric embedding of formula_3 into formula_467 given by the Hahn–Banach theorem, the quotient formula_538 is infinite-dimensional, and even nonseparable. 
However, Robert C. James has constructed an example of a non-reflexive space, usually called &quot;the James space&quot; and denoted by formula_539 such that the quotient formula_540 is one-dimensional. 
Furthermore, this space formula_541 is isometrically isomorphic to its bidual.

When formula_3 is reflexive, it follows that all closed and bounded convex subsets of formula_3 are weakly compact. 
In a Hilbert space formula_430 the weak compactness of the unit ball is very often used in the following way: every bounded sequence in formula_312 has weakly convergent subsequences.

Weak compactness of the unit ball provides a tool for finding solutions in reflexive spaces to certain optimization problems. 
For example, every convex continuous function on the unit ball formula_546 of a reflexive space attains its minimum at some point in formula_547

As a special case of the preceding result, when formula_3 is a reflexive space over formula_549 every continuous linear functional formula_239 in formula_180 attains its maximum formula_552 on the unit ball of formula_142 
The following theorem of Robert C. James provides a converse statement.

The theorem can be extended to give a characterization of weakly compact convex sets.

On every non-reflexive Banach space formula_40 there exist continuous linear functionals that are not &quot;norm-attaining&quot;. 
However, the Bishop–Phelps theorem states that norm-attaining functionals are norm dense in the dual formula_180 of formula_142

===Weak convergences of sequences===

A sequence formula_557 in a Banach space formula_3 is &quot;weakly convergent&quot; to a vector formula_25 if formula_560 converges to formula_561 for every continuous linear functional formula_239 in the dual formula_563 The sequence formula_557 is a &quot;weakly Cauchy sequence&quot; if formula_560 converges to a scalar limit formula_566 for every formula_239 in formula_563 
A sequence formula_569 in the dual formula_180 is &quot;weakly* convergent&quot; to a functional formula_571 if formula_572 converges to formula_561 for every formula_28 in formula_142 
Weakly Cauchy sequences, weakly convergent and weakly* convergent sequences are norm bounded, as a consequence of the Banach–Steinhaus theorem.

When the sequence formula_557 in formula_3 is a weakly Cauchy sequence, the limit formula_578 above defines a bounded linear functional on the dual formula_409 that is, an element formula_578 of the bidual of formula_40 and formula_578 is the limit of formula_557 in the weak*-topology of the bidual. 
The Banach space formula_3 is &quot;weakly sequentially complete&quot; if every weakly Cauchy sequence is weakly convergent in formula_142 
It follows from the preceding discussion that reflexive spaces are weakly sequentially complete.

An orthonormal sequence in a Hilbert space is a simple example of a weakly convergent sequence, with limit equal to the formula_365 vector. 
The unit vector basis of formula_298 for formula_588 or of formula_420 is another example of a &quot;weakly null sequence&quot;, that is, a sequence that converges weakly to formula_590 
For every weakly null sequence in a Banach space, there exists a sequence of convex combinations of vectors from the given sequence that is norm-converging to formula_590

The unit vector basis of formula_300 is not weakly Cauchy. 
Weakly Cauchy sequences in formula_300 are weakly convergent, since formula_594-spaces are weakly sequentially complete. 
Actually, weakly convergent sequences in formula_300 are norm convergent. This means that formula_300 satisfies Schur&#x27;s property.

====Results involving the basis====

Weakly Cauchy sequences and the formula_300 basis are the opposite cases of the dichotomy established in the following deep result of H. P. Rosenthal.

A complement to this result is due to Odell and Rosenthal (1975).

By the Goldstine theorem, every element of the unit ball formula_598 of formula_467 is weak*-limit of a net in the unit ball of formula_142 When formula_3 does not contain formula_482 every element of formula_598 is weak*-limit of a in the unit ball of formula_142

When the Banach space formula_3 is separable, the unit ball of the dual formula_409 equipped with the weak*-topology, is a metrizable compact space formula_305 and every element formula_498 in the bidual formula_467 defines a bounded function on formula_348:
formula_611

This function is continuous for the compact topology of formula_348 if and only if formula_498 is actually in formula_40 considered as subset of formula_474 
Assume in addition for the rest of the paragraph that formula_3 does not contain formula_617 
By the preceding result of Odell and Rosenthal, the function formula_498 is the pointwise limit on formula_348 of a sequence formula_620 of continuous functions on formula_305 it is therefore a first Baire class function on formula_448 
The unit ball of the bidual is a pointwise compact subset of the first Baire class on formula_448

====Sequences, weak and weak* compactness====

When formula_3 is separable, the unit ball of the dual is weak*-compact by the Banach–Alaoglu theorem and metrizable for the weak* topology, hence every bounded sequence in the dual has weakly* convergent subsequences. 
This applies to separable reflexive spaces, but more is true in this case, as stated below.

The weak topology of a Banach space formula_3 is metrizable if and only if formula_3 is finite-dimensional. If the dual formula_180 is separable, the weak topology of the unit ball of formula_3 is metrizable. 
This applies in particular to separable reflexive Banach spaces. 
Although the weak topology of the unit ball is not metrizable in general, one can characterize weak compactness using sequences.

A Banach space formula_3 is reflexive if and only if each bounded sequence in formula_3 has a weakly convergent subsequence.

A weakly compact subset formula_319 in formula_300 is norm-compact. Indeed, every sequence in formula_319 has weakly convergent subsequences by Eberlein–Šmulian, that are norm convergent by the Schur property of formula_617

=== Type and cotype ===

A way to classify Banach spaces is through the probabilistic notion of type and cotype, these two measure how far a Banach space is from a Hilbert space.

==Schauder bases==
A &quot;Schauder basis&quot; in a Banach space formula_3 is a sequence formula_636 of vectors in formula_3 with the property that for every vector formula_479 there exist defined scalars formula_639 depending on formula_640 such that
formula_641

Banach spaces with a Schauder basis are necessarily separable, because the countable set of finite linear combinations with rational coefficients (say) is dense.

It follows from the Banach–Steinhaus theorem that the linear mappings formula_642 are uniformly bounded by some constant formula_643 
Let formula_644 denote the coordinate functionals which assign to every formula_28 in formula_3 the coordinate formula_647 of formula_28 in the above expansion. 
They are called &quot;biorthogonal functionals&quot;. When the basis vectors have norm formula_273 the coordinate functionals formula_644 have norm formula_651 in the dual of formula_142

Most classical separable spaces have explicit bases. 
The Haar system formula_653 is a basis for formula_425 when formula_655 
The trigonometric system is a basis in formula_656 when formula_531 
The Schauder system is a basis in the space formula_658 
The question of whether the disk algebra formula_328 has a basis remained open for more than forty years, until Bočkarev showed in 1974 that formula_328 admits a basis constructed from the Franklin system.

Since every vector formula_28 in a Banach space formula_3 with a basis is the limit of formula_663 with formula_664 of finite rank and uniformly bounded, the space formula_3 satisfies the bounded approximation property. 
The first example by Enflo of a space failing the approximation property was at the same time the first example of a separable Banach space without a Schauder basis.

Robert C. James characterized reflexivity in Banach spaces with a basis: the space formula_3 with a Schauder basis is reflexive if and only if the basis is both shrinking and boundedly complete. 
In this case, the biorthogonal functionals form a basis of the dual of formula_142

==Tensor product==
Let formula_3 and formula_185 be two formula_4-vector spaces. The tensor product formula_671 of formula_3 and formula_185 is a formula_4-vector space formula_190 with a bilinear mapping formula_676 which has the following universal property:

:If formula_677 is any bilinear mapping into a formula_4-vector space formula_679 then there exists a unique linear mapping formula_680 such that formula_681

The image under formula_187 of a couple formula_683 in formula_259 is denoted by formula_685 and called a &quot;simple tensor&quot;. 
Every element formula_686 in formula_671 is a finite sum of such simple tensors.

There are various norms that can be placed on the tensor product of the underlying vector spaces, amongst others the projective cross norm and injective cross norm introduced by A. Grothendieck in 1955.

In general, the tensor product of complete spaces is not complete again. When working with Banach spaces, it is customary to say that the &quot;projective tensor product&quot; of two Banach spaces formula_3 and formula_185 is the formula_690 of the algebraic tensor product formula_671 equipped with the projective tensor norm, and similarly for the &quot;injective tensor product&quot; formula_692 
Grothendieck proved in particular that

formula_693
where formula_348 is a compact Hausdorff space, formula_695 the Banach space of continuous functions from formula_348 to formula_185 and formula_698 the space of Bochner-measurable and integrable functions from formula_699 to formula_522 and where the isomorphisms are isometric. 
The two isomorphisms above are the respective extensions of the map sending the tensor formula_701 to the vector-valued function formula_702

===Tensor products and the approximation property===

Let formula_3 be a Banach space. The tensor product formula_704 is identified isometrically with the closure in formula_339 of the set of finite rank operators. 
When formula_3 has the approximation property, this closure coincides with the space of compact operators on formula_142

For every Banach space formula_522 there is a natural norm formula_709 linear map
formula_710
obtained by extending the identity map of the algebraic tensor product. Grothendieck related the approximation problem to the question of whether this map is one-to-one when formula_185 is the dual of formula_142
Precisely, for every Banach space formula_40 the map
formula_714
is one-to-one if and only if formula_3 has the approximation property.

Grothendieck conjectured that formula_690 and formula_717 must be different whenever formula_3 and formula_185 are infinite-dimensional Banach spaces. 
This was disproved by Gilles Pisier in 1983. 
Pisier constructed an infinite-dimensional Banach space formula_3 such that formula_721 and formula_722 are equal. Furthermore, just as Enflo&#x27;s example, this space formula_3 is a &quot;hand-made&quot; space that fails to have the approximation property. On the other hand, Szankowski proved that the classical space formula_724 does not have the approximation property.

==Some classification results==

===Characterizations of Hilbert space among Banach spaces===

A necessary and sufficient condition for the norm of a Banach space formula_3 to be associated to an inner product is the parallelogram identity:

It follows, for example, that the Lebesgue space formula_425 is a Hilbert space only when formula_727 
If this identity is satisfied, the associated inner product is given by the polarization identity. In the case of real scalars, this gives:
formula_728

For complex scalars, defining the inner product so as to be formula_7-linear in formula_640 antilinear in formula_731 the polarization identity gives:
formula_732

To see that the parallelogram law is sufficient, one observes in the real case that formula_733 is symmetric, and in the complex case, that it satisfies the Hermitian symmetry property and formula_734 The parallelogram law implies that formula_733 is additive in formula_367 
It follows that it is linear over the rationals, thus linear by continuity.

Several characterizations of spaces isomorphic (rather than isometric) to Hilbert spaces are available. 
The parallelogram law can be extended to more than two vectors, and weakened by the introduction of a two-sided inequality with a constant formula_737: Kwapień proved that if
formula_738
for every integer formula_18 and all families of vectors formula_740 then the Banach space formula_3 is isomorphic to a Hilbert space. 
Here, formula_742 denotes the average over the formula_743 possible choices of signs formula_744
In the same article, Kwapień proved that the validity of a Banach-valued Parseval&#x27;s theorem for the Fourier transform characterizes Banach spaces isomorphic to Hilbert spaces.

Lindenstrauss and Tzafriri proved that a Banach space in which every closed linear subspace is complemented (that is, is the range of a bounded linear projection) is isomorphic to a Hilbert space. The proof rests upon Dvoretzky&#x27;s theorem about Euclidean sections of high-dimensional centrally symmetric convex bodies. In other words, Dvoretzky&#x27;s theorem states that for every integer formula_745 any finite-dimensional normed space, with dimension sufficiently large compared to formula_745 contains subspaces nearly isometric to the formula_18-dimensional Euclidean space.

The next result gives the solution of the so-called . An infinite-dimensional Banach space formula_3 is said to be &quot;homogeneous&quot; if it is isomorphic to all its infinite-dimensional closed subspaces. A Banach space isomorphic to formula_301 is homogeneous, and Banach asked for the converse.

An infinite-dimensional Banach space is &quot;hereditarily indecomposable&quot; when no subspace of it can be isomorphic to the direct sum of two infinite-dimensional Banach spaces. 
The Gowers dichotomy theorem asserts that every infinite-dimensional Banach space formula_3 contains, either a subspace formula_185 with unconditional basis, or a hereditarily indecomposable subspace formula_192 and in particular, formula_190 is not isomorphic to its closed hyperplanes. 
If formula_3 is homogeneous, it must therefore have an unconditional basis. It follows then from the partial solution obtained by Komorowski and Tomczak–Jaegermann, for spaces with an unconditional basis, that formula_3 is isomorphic to formula_756

===Metric classification===

If formula_186 is an isometry from the Banach space formula_3 onto the Banach space formula_185 (where both formula_3 and formula_185 are vector spaces over formula_64), then the Mazur–Ulam theorem states that formula_187 must be an affine transformation. 
In particular, if formula_764 this is formula_187 maps the zero of formula_3 to the zero of formula_522 then formula_187 must be linear. This result implies that the metric in Banach spaces, and more generally in normed spaces, completely captures their linear structure.

===Topological classification===

Finite dimensional Banach spaces are homeomorphic as topological spaces, if and only if they have the same dimension as real vector spaces.

Anderson–Kadec theorem (1965–66) proves that any two infinite-dimensional separable Banach spaces are homeomorphic as topological spaces. Kadec&#x27;s theorem was extended by Torunczyk, who proved that any two Banach spaces are homeomorphic if and only if they have the same density character, the minimum cardinality of a dense subset.

===Spaces of continuous functions===

When two compact Hausdorff spaces formula_769 and formula_770 are homeomorphic, the Banach spaces formula_771 and formula_772 are isometric. Conversely, when formula_769 is not homeomorphic to formula_774 the (multiplicative) Banach–Mazur distance between formula_771 and formula_772 must be greater than or equal to formula_777 see above the results by Amir and Cambern. 
Although uncountable compact metric spaces can have different homeomorphy types, one has the following result due to Milutin:

The situation is different for countably infinite compact Hausdorff spaces. 
Every countably infinite compact formula_348 is homeomorphic to some closed interval of ordinal numbers
formula_779
equipped with the order topology, where formula_780 is a countably infinite ordinal. 
The Banach space formula_304 is then isometric to . When formula_782 are two countably infinite ordinals, and assuming formula_783 the spaces and are isomorphic if and only if .
For example, the Banach spaces
formula_784
are mutually non-isomorphic.

==Examples==


==Derivatives==

Several concepts of a derivative may be defined on a Banach space. See the articles on the Fréchet derivative and the Gateaux derivative for details. 
The Fréchet derivative allows for an extension of the concept of a total derivative to Banach spaces. The Gateaux derivative allows for an extension of a directional derivative to locally convex topological vector spaces. 
Fréchet differentiability is a stronger condition than Gateaux differentiability. 
The quasi-derivative is another generalization of directional derivative that implies a stronger condition than Gateaux differentiability, but a weaker condition than Fréchet differentiability.

==Generalizations==

Several important spaces in functional analysis, for instance the space of all infinitely often differentiable functions formula_785 or the space of all distributions on formula_549 are complete but are not normed vector spaces and hence not Banach spaces. 
In Fréchet spaces one still has a complete metric, while LF-spaces are complete uniform vector spaces arising as limits of Fréchet spaces.

<doc id="3992" wikidata="Q36184" url="?curid=3992" title="Bram Stoker">
<text>Abraham Stoker (8 November 1847 – 20 April 1912), popularly known as Bram Stoker, was an Irish author who wrote the 1897 Gothic horror novel &quot;Dracula&quot;. The work is widely considered a milestone in Vampire fiction. During his life, he was better known as the personal assistant of the actor Sir Henry Irving and business manager of the West End&#x27;s Lyceum Theatre, which Irving owned.

In his early years, Stoker worked as a theatre critic for an Irish newspaper and wrote stories as well as commentaries. He also enjoyed travelling, particularly to Cruden Bay in Scotland where he set two of his novels and drew inspiration for writing &quot;Dracula&quot;. He died on 20 April 1912 due to locomotor ataxia and was cremated in north London. 

Since his death, his magnum opus &quot;Dracula&quot; has become one of the best-known works in English literature, and the novel has often been adapted for numerous movies, films, comics, games, short stories, and plays.

==Early life==
Stoker was born on 8 November 1847 at 15 Marino Crescent, Clontarf, in Dublin, Ireland. The park adjacent to the house is now known as Bram Stoker Park. His parents were Abraham Stoker (1799–1876), an Anglo-Irishman from Dublin and Charlotte Mathilda Blake Thornley (1818–1901), of English and Irish descent, who was raised in County Sligo. Stoker was the third of seven children, the eldest of whom was Sir Thornley Stoker, 1st Baronet. Abraham and Charlotte were members of the Church of Ireland Parish of Clontarf and attended the parish church with their children, who were baptised there. Abraham was a senior civil servant.

Stoker was bedridden with an unknown illness until he started school at the age of seven when he made a complete recovery. Of this time, Stoker wrote, &quot;I was naturally thoughtful, and the leisure of long illness gave opportunity for many thoughts which were fruitful according to their kind in later years.&quot; He was privately educated at Bective House school run by the Reverend William Woods.

After his recovery, he grew up without further serious illnesses, even excelling as an athlete at Trinity College, Dublin, which he attended from 1864 to 1870. He graduated with a BA in 1870 and paid to receive his MA in 1875. Though he later in life recalled graduating &quot;with honours in mathematics&quot;, this appears to have been a mistake. He was named University Athlete, participating in multiple sports, including playing rugby for Dublin University. He was auditor of the College Historical Society (&quot;the Hist&quot;) and president of the University Philosophical Society (he remains the only student in Trinity&#x27;s history to hold both positions), where his first paper was on &quot;Sensationalism in Fiction and Society&quot;.

==Early career==
Stoker became interested in the theatre while a student through his friend Dr. Maunsell. While working for the Irish Civil Service, he became the theatre critic for the &quot;Dublin Evening Mail&quot;, which was co-owned by Sheridan Le Fanu, an author of Gothic tales. Theatre critics were held in low esteem at the time, but Stoker attracted notice by the quality of his reviews. In December 1876, he gave a favourable review of Henry Irving&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; at the Theatre Royal in Dublin. Irving invited Stoker for dinner at the Shelbourne Hotel where he was staying, and they became friends. Stoker also wrote stories, and &quot;Crystal Cup&quot; was published by the London Society in 1872, followed by &quot;The Chain of Destiny&quot; in four parts in &quot;The Shamrock&quot;. In 1876, while a civil servant in Dublin, Stoker wrote the non-fiction book &quot;The Duties of Clerks of Petty Sessions in Ireland&quot; (published 1879), which remained a standard work. Furthermore, he possessed an interest in art and was a founder of the Dublin Sketching Club in 1879.

==Lyceum Theatre==
In 1878, Stoker married Florence Balcombe, daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel James Balcombe of 1 Marino Crescent. She was a celebrated beauty whose former suitor had been Oscar Wilde. Stoker had known Wilde from his student days, having proposed him for membership of the university&#x27;s Philosophical Society while he was president. Wilde was upset at Florence&#x27;s decision, but Stoker later resumed the acquaintanceship, and, after Wilde&#x27;s fall, visited him on the Continent.

The Stokers moved to London, where Stoker became acting manager and then business manager of Irving&#x27;s Lyceum Theatre in the West End, a post he held for 27 years. On 31 December 1879, Bram and Florence&#x27;s only child was born, a son whom they christened Irving Noel Thornley Stoker. The collaboration with Henry Irving was important for Stoker and through him, he became involved in London&#x27;s high society, where he met James Abbott McNeill Whistler and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (to whom he was distantly related). Working for Irving, the most famous actor of his time, and managing one of the most successful theatres in London made Stoker a notable if busy man. He was dedicated to Irving and his memoirs show he idolised him. In London, Stoker also met Hall Caine, who became one of his closest friends – he dedicated &quot;Dracula&quot; to him.

In the course of Irving&#x27;s tours, Stoker travelled the world, although he never visited Eastern Europe, a setting for his most famous novel. Stoker enjoyed the United States, where Irving was popular. With Irving, he was invited twice to the White House and knew William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt. Stoker set two of his novels in America and used Americans as characters, the most notable being Quincey Morris. He also met one of his literary idols, Walt Whitman, having written to him in 1872 an extraordinary letter that some have interpreted as the expression of a deeply-suppressed homosexuality.

== Bram Stoker in Cruden Bay ==
Stoker was a regular visitor to Cruden Bay in Scotland between 1892 and 1910. His month-long holidays to the Aberdeenshire coastal village provided a large portion of available time for writing his books. Two novels were set in Cruden Bay: &quot;The Watter&#x27;s Mou&#x27; &quot;(1895) and &quot;The Mystery of the Sea&quot; (1902). He started writing &quot;Dracula&quot; there in 1895 while in residence at the Kilmarnock Arms Hotel. The guest book with his signatures from 1894 and 1895 still survives. The nearby Slains Castle (also known as New Slains Castle) is linked with Bram Stoker and plausibly provided the visual palette for the descriptions of Castle Dracula during the writing phase. A distinctive room in Slains Castle, the octagonal hall, matches the description of the octagonal room in Castle Dracula.

==Writings==

Stoker visited the English coastal town of Whitby in 1890, and that visit was said to be part of the inspiration for &quot;Dracula&quot;, staying at a guesthouse in West Cliff at 6 Royal Crescent, doing his research at the public library at 7 Pier Road (now &quot;Quayside Fish and Chips&quot;). Count Dracula comes ashore at Whitby, and in the shape of a black dog runs up the 199 steps to the graveyard of St Mary&#x27;s Church in the shadow of the Whitby Abbey ruins. Stoker began writing novels while working as manager for Irving and secretary and director of London&#x27;s Lyceum Theatre, beginning with &quot;The Snake&#x27;s Pass&quot; in 1890 and &quot;Dracula&quot; in 1897. During this period, he was part of the literary staff of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in London, and he wrote other fiction, including the horror novels &quot;The Lady of the Shroud&quot; (1909) and &quot;The Lair of the White Worm&quot; (1911). He published his &quot;Personal Reminiscences of Henry Irving&quot; in 1906, after Irving&#x27;s death, which proved successful, and managed productions at the Prince of Wales Theatre.

Before writing &quot;Dracula&quot;, Stoker met Ármin Vámbéry, a Hungarian-Jewish writer and traveller (born in Szent-György, Kingdom of Hungary now Svätý Jur, Slovakia). Dracula likely emerged from Vámbéry&#x27;s dark stories of the Carpathian Mountains. However this claim has been challenged by many including Elizabeth Miller, a professor who, since 1990, has had as her major field of research and writing &quot;Dracula&quot;, and its author, sources, and influences. She has stated, &quot;The only comment about the subject matter of the talk was that Vambery &#x27;spoke loudly against Russian aggression.&#x27;&quot; There had been nothing in their conversations about the &quot;tales of the terrible Dracula&quot; that are supposed to have &quot;inspired Stoker to equate his vampire-protagonist with the long-dead tyrant.&quot; At any rate, by this time, Stoker&#x27;s novel was well underway, and he was already using the name Dracula for his vampire. Stoker then spent several years researching Central and East European folklore and mythological stories of vampires.

The 1972 book &quot;In Search of Dracula&quot; by Radu Florescu and Raymond McNally claimed that the Count in Stoker&#x27;s novel was based on Vlad III Dracula. However, according to Elizabeth Miller, Stoker borrowed only the name and &quot;scraps of miscellaneous information&quot; about Romanian history; further, there are no comments about Vlad III in the author&#x27;s working notes.
&quot;Dracula&quot; is an epistolary novel, written as a collection of realistic but completely fictional diary entries, telegrams, letters, ship&#x27;s logs, and newspaper clippings, all of which added a level of detailed realism to the story, a skill which Stoker had developed as a newspaper writer. At the time of its publication, &quot;Dracula&quot; was considered a &quot;straightforward horror novel&quot; based on imaginary creations of supernatural life. &quot;It gave form to a universal fantasy ... and became a part of popular culture.&quot;

According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of World Biography&quot;, Stoker&#x27;s stories are today included in the categories of horror fiction, romanticized Gothic stories, and melodrama. They are classified alongside other works of popular fiction, such as Mary Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, which also used the myth-making and story-telling method of having multiple narrators telling the same tale from different perspectives. According to historian Jules Zanger, this leads the reader to the assumption that &quot;they can&#x27;t all be lying&quot;.

The original 541-page typescript of &quot;Dracula&quot; was believed to have been lost until it was found in a barn in northwestern Pennsylvania in the early 1980s. It consisted of typed sheets with many emendations, and handwritten on the title page was &quot;THE UN-DEAD.&quot; The author&#x27;s name was shown at the bottom as Bram Stoker. Author Robert Latham remarked: &quot;the most famous horror novel ever published, its title changed at the last minute&quot;. The typescript was purchased by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen.

Stoker&#x27;s inspirations for the story, in addition to Whitby, may have included a visit to Slains Castle in Aberdeenshire, a visit to the crypts of St. Michan&#x27;s Church in Dublin, and the novella &quot;Carmilla&quot; by Sheridan Le Fanu.

Stoker&#x27;s original research notes for the novel are kept by the Rosenbach Museum and Library in Philadelphia. A facsimile edition of the notes was created by Elizabeth Miller and Robert Eighteen-Bisang in 1998.

== Stoker at the London Library ==
Stoker was a member of the London Library and conducted much of the research for &quot;Dracula&quot; there. In 2018, the Library discovered some of the books that Stoker used for his research, complete with notes and marginalia.

==Death==

After suffering a number of strokes, Stoker died at No. 26 St George&#x27;s Square, London on 20 April 1912. Some biographers attribute the cause of death to overwork, others to tertiary syphilis. His death certificate listed the cause of death as &quot;Locomotor ataxia 6 months&quot;, presumed to be a reference to syphilis. He was cremated, and his ashes were placed in a display urn at Golders Green Crematorium in north London. The ashes of Irving Noel Stoker, the author&#x27;s son, were added to his father&#x27;s urn following his death in 1961. The original plan had been to keep his parents&#x27; ashes together, but after Florence Stoker&#x27;s death, her ashes were scattered at the Gardens of Rest. His ashes are still stored in Golders Green Crematorium today.

==Beliefs and philosophy==
Stoker was raised a Protestant in the Church of Ireland. He was a strong supporter of the Liberal Party and took a keen interest in Irish affairs. As a &quot;philosophical home ruler&quot;, he supported Home Rule for Ireland brought about by peaceful means. He remained an ardent monarchist who believed that Ireland should remain within the British Empire. He was an admirer of Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone, whom he knew personally, and supported his plans for Ireland.

Stoker believed in progress and took a keen interest in science and science-based medicine. Some of Stoker&#x27;s novels represent early examples of science fiction, such as &quot;The Lady of the Shroud&quot; (1909). He had a writer&#x27;s interest in the occult, notably mesmerism, but despised fraud and believed in the superiority of the scientific method over superstition. Stoker counted among his friends J. W. Brodie-Innis, a member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, and hired member Pamela Colman Smith as an artist for the Lyceum Theatre, but no evidence suggests that Stoker ever joined the Order himself. 

Like Irving, who was an active Freemason, Stoker also became a member of the order, &quot;initiated into Freemasonry in Buckingham and Chandos Lodge No. 1150 in February 1883, passed in April of that same year, and raised to the degree of Master Mason on 20 June 1883.&quot; Stoker however was not a particular active Freemason, spent only six years as an active member, and did not take part in any Masonic activities during his time in London.
==Posthumous==
The short story collection &quot;Dracula&#x27;s Guest and Other Weird Stories&quot; was published in 1914 by Stoker&#x27;s widow, Florence Stoker, who was also his literary executrix. The first film adaptation of &quot;Dracula&quot; was F. W. Murnau&#x27;s &quot;Nosferatu&quot;, released in 1922, with Max Schreck starring as Count Orlok. Florence Stoker eventually sued the filmmakers and was represented by the attorneys of the British Incorporated Society of Authors. Her chief legal complaint was that she had neither been asked for permission for the adaptation nor paid any royalty. The case dragged on for some years, with Mrs. Stoker demanding the destruction of the negative and all prints of the film. The suit was finally resolved in the widow&#x27;s favour in July 1925. A single print of the film survived, however, and it has become well known. The first authorised film version of &quot;Dracula&quot; did not come about until almost a decade later when Universal Studios released Tod Browning&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot; starring Bela Lugosi.

===Dacre Stoker===
Canadian writer Dacre Stoker, a great-grandnephew of Bram Stoker, decided to write &quot;a sequel that bore the Stoker name&quot; to &quot;reestablish creative control over&quot; the original novel, with encouragement from screenwriter Ian Holt, because of the Stokers&#x27; frustrating history with &quot;Dracula&#x27;s&quot; copyright. In 2009, &quot;Dracula: The Un-Dead&quot; was released, written by Dacre Stoker and Ian Holt. Both writers &quot;based [their work] on Bram Stoker&#x27;s own handwritten notes for characters and plot threads excised from the original edition&quot; along with their own research for the sequel. This also marked Dacre Stoker&#x27;s writing debut.

In spring 2012, Dacre Stoker in collaboration with Elizabeth Miller presented the &quot;lost&quot; Dublin Journal written by Bram Stoker, which had been kept by his great-grandson Noel Dobbs. Stoker&#x27;s diary entries shed a light on the issues that concerned him before his London years. A remark about a boy who caught flies in a bottle might be a clue for the later development of the Renfield character in &quot;Dracula&quot;.

==Commemorations==
On 8 November 2012, Stoker was honoured with a Google Doodle on Google&#x27;s homepage commemorating the 165th anniversary of his birth.

An annual festival takes place in Dublin, the birthplace of Bram Stoker, in honour of his literary achievements. The Dublin City Council Bram Stoker Festival encompasses spectacles, literary events, film, family-friendly activities and outdoor events, and takes place every October Bank Holiday Weekend in Dublin. The festival is supported by the Bram Stoker Estate and is funded by Dublin City Council.

<doc id="3995" wikidata="Q188966" url="?curid=3995" title="Contract bridge">
<text>Contract bridge, or simply bridge, is a trick-taking card game using a standard 52-card deck. In its basic format, it is played by four players in two competing partnerships, with partners sitting opposite each other around a table. Millions of people play bridge worldwide in clubs, tournaments, online and with friends at home, making it one of the world&#x27;s most popular card games, particularly among seniors. The World Bridge Federation (WBF) is the governing body for international competitive bridge, with numerous other bodies governing it at the regional level.

The game consists of a number of , each progressing through four phases. The cards are to the players; then the players &quot;call&quot; (or &quot;bid&quot;) in an seeking to take the , specifying how many tricks the partnership receiving the contract (the declaring side) needs to take to receive points for the deal. During the auction, partners use their bids to exchange information about their hands, including overall strength and distribution of the suits; no other means of conveying or implying any information is permitted. The cards are then played, the trying to fulfill the contract, and the trying to stop the declaring side from achieving its goal. The deal is scored based on the number of tricks taken, the contract, and various other factors which depend to some extent on the variation of the game being played.

Rubber bridge is the most popular variation for casual play, but most club and tournament play involves some variant of duplicate bridge, where the cards are not re-dealt on each occasion, but the same deal is played by two or more sets of players (or &quot;tables&quot;) to enable comparative scoring.

==History and etymology==
Bridge is a member of the family of trick-taking games and is a derivative of whist, which had become the dominant such game and enjoyed a loyal following for centuries. The idea of a trick-taking, 52-card game has its first documented origins in Italy and France. The French physician and author Rabelais (1493–1553) mentions a game called &quot;La Triomphe&quot; in one of his works, and Juan Luis Vives&#x27;s &quot;Linguae latinae exercitio&quot; (Exercise in the Latin language) of 1539 features a dialogue on card games in which the characters play &#x27;Triumphus hispanicus&#x27; (Spanish Triumph).

Bridge departed from whist with the creation of &quot;Biritch&quot; in the 19th century and evolved through the late 19th and early 20th centuries to form the present game. The first known rule book for bridge, dated 1886, is &quot;&quot; written by John Collinson, an English financier working in Ottoman Constantinople. It and his subsequent letter to &quot;The Saturday Review&quot;, dated 28 May 1906, document the origin of &quot;Biritch&quot; as being the Russian community in Constantinople. The word &quot;biritch&quot; is thought to be a transliteration of the Russian word (бирчий, бирич), an occupation of a diplomatic clerk or an announcer. Another theory is that British soldiers invented the game bridge while serving in the Crimean War, and named it after the Galata Bridge, which they crossed on their way to a coffeehouse to play cards.

Biritch had many significant bridge-like developments: dealer chose the trump suit, or nominated his partner to do so; there was a call of &quot;no trumps&quot; (&quot;biritch&quot;); dealer&#x27;s partner&#x27;s hand became dummy; points were scored above and below the line; game was 3NT, 4 and 5 (although 8 club odd tricks and 15 spade odd tricks were needed); the score could be doubled and redoubled; and there were slam bonuses. It also has some features in common with solo whist. This game, and variants of it known as &quot;bridge&quot; and &quot;bridge whist&quot;, became popular in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1890s despite the long-established dominance of whist. Its breakthrough was its acceptance in 1894 by Lord Brougham at London&#x27;s Portland Club.
In 1904, auction bridge was developed, in which the players bid in a competitive auction to decide the contract and declarer. The object became to make at least as many tricks as were contracted for, and penalties were introduced for failing to do so. In auction bridge, bidding beyond winning the auction is pointless; for example, if taking all 13 tricks, there is no difference in score between a 1 and a 7 final contract, as the bonus for rubber, small slam or grand slam depends on the number of tricks taken rather than the number of tricks contracted for.

The modern game of contract bridge was the result of innovations to the scoring of auction bridge by Harold Stirling Vanderbilt and others. The most significant change was that only the tricks contracted for were scored below the line toward game or a slam bonus, a change that resulted in bidding becoming much more challenging and interesting. Also new was the concept of &quot;vulnerability&quot;, which made sacrifices to protect the lead in a rubber more expensive. The various scores were adjusted to produce a more balanced and interesting game. Vanderbilt set out his rules in 1925, and within a few years contract bridge had so supplanted other forms of the game that &quot;bridge&quot; became synonymous with &quot;contract bridge&quot;.

The form of bridge mostly played in clubs, tournaments and online is duplicate bridge. The number of people who play contract bridge has declined since its peak in the 1940s, when a survey found it was played in 44% of US households. The game is still widely played, especially amongst retirees, and in 2005 the ACBL estimated there were 25 million players in the US.

== Gameplay ==

=== Overview ===
Bridge is a four-player partnership trick-taking game with thirteen tricks per deal. The dominant variations of the game are rubber bridge, which is more common in social play; and duplicate bridge, which enables comparative scoring in tournament play. Each player is dealt thirteen cards from a standard 52-card deck. A starts when a player leads (i.e., plays the first card). The leader to the first trick is determined by the auction; the leader to each subsequent trick is the player who won the preceding trick. Each player, in clockwise order, plays one card on the trick. Players must play a card of the same suit as the original card led, unless they have none (said to be &quot;void&quot;), in which case they may play any card.

The rank of the cards played determines which player wins the trick. Within each suit, the ace is ranked highest followed by the king, queen and jack and then the ten through to the two. In a deal in which the auction has determined that there is no trump suit, the trick is won by the highest-ranked card of the suit led; cards of suits other than that led cannot win. In a deal with a trump suit, cards of that suit are superior in rank to any of the cards of any other suit. If one or more players plays a trump to a trick when void in the suit led, the highest-ranked trump wins. For example, if the trump suit is spades and a player is void in the suit led and plays a spade card, they win the trick if no other player plays a higher spade. If a card of the trump suit is led, the usual rule for trick-taking applies and the highest-ranked card of that suit wins.

Unlike that of its predecessor, whist, the goal of bridge is not simply to take the most tricks in a deal. Instead, the goal is successfully to estimate how many tricks one&#x27;s partnership can take, and then to meet or exceed that estimate. To illustrate this, the simpler partnership trick-taking game of spades has a similar mechanism: the usual trick-taking rules apply with the trump suit being spades, but in the beginning of the game, players &quot;bid&quot; or estimate how many tricks they can win, and the number of tricks bid by both players in a partnership are added. If a partnership takes at least that many tricks, they receive points for the round; otherwise, they lose penalty points.

Bridge extends the concept of bidding into an , in which partnerships compete to win a , specifying both how many tricks they will need to take in order to receive points and the trump suit (or &quot;no trump&quot;, meaning that there will be no trump suit). Players take turns to call in a clockwise order: each player in turn either passes, doubleswhich increases the penalties for not making the contract specified by the opposing partnership&#x27;s last bid, but also increases the reward for making itor redoubles, or states a contract that their partnership will adopt, which must be higher than the previous highest bid (if any). Eventually, the player who bid the highest contractwhich is determined by the contract&#x27;s level as well as the trump suit or no trumpwins the contract for their partnership.

In the example auction below, the east–west pair secures the contract of 6; the auction concludes when there have been three successive passes. Note that six tricks are added to stated contract values, so the six-level contract is a contract of twelve tricks. In practice, estimating a good contract without information about one&#x27;s partner&#x27;s hand is difficult, so there exist many bidding systems assigning meanings to bids, with common ones including Standard American, Acol, and 2/1 game forcing. Contrast with Spades, where players only have to bid their own hand.

After the contract is decided and the first lead is made, the declarer&#x27;s partner (dummy) lays their cards face up on the table, and the declarer plays the dummy&#x27;s cards as well as their own. The opposing partnership is called the , and their goal is to stop the declarer from fulfilling his contract. Once all the cards have been played, the deal is scored: if the declaring side makes their contract, they receive points based on the level of the contract, with some trump suits being worth more points than others and &quot;no trump&quot; being worth even more, as well as bonus points for any . If the declarer fails to fulfill the contract, the defenders receive points depending on the declaring side&#x27;s undertricks (the number of tricks short of the contract) and whether the contract was &quot;doubled&quot; or &quot;redoubled&quot;.

=== Setup and dealing ===

The four players sit in two partnerships with players sitting opposite their partners. A cardinal direction is assigned to each seat, so that one partnership sits in North and South, while the other sits in West and East. The cards may be freshly dealt or, in duplicate bridge games, pre-dealt. All that is needed in basic games are the cards and a method of keeping score, but there is often other equipment on the table, such as a board containing the cards to be played (in duplicate bridge), bidding boxes, or screens.
In rubber bridge each player draws a card at the start of the game; the player who draws the highest card deals first. The second highest card becomes the dealer&#x27;s partner and takes the chair on the opposite side of the table. They play against the other two. The deck is shuffled and cut, usually by the player to the left of the dealer, before dealing. Players take turns to deal, in clockwise order. The dealer deals the cards clockwise, one card at a time. Normally, rubber bridge is played with two packs of cards and whilst one pack is being dealt, the dealer&#x27;s partner shuffles the other pack. After shuffling the pack is placed on the right ready for the next dealer. Before dealing, the next dealer passes the cards to the previous dealer who cuts them.

In duplicate bridge the cards are pre-dealt, either by hand or by a computerized dealing machine, in order to allow for competitive scoring. Once dealt, the cards are placed in a device called a &quot;board&quot;, having slots designated for each player&#x27;s cardinal direction seating position. After a deal has been played, players return their cards to the appropriate slot in the board, ready to be played by the next table.

=== Auction ===

The dealer opens the auction and can make the first call, and the auction proceeds clockwise. When it is their turn to call, a player may passbut can enter into the bidding lateror bid a contract, specifying the level of their contract and either the trump suit or &quot;no trump&quot; (the denomination), provided that it is higher than the last bid by any player, including their partner. All bids promise to take a number of tricks in excess of six, so a bid must be between one (seven tricks) and seven (thirteen tricks). A bid is higher than another bid if either the level is greater (e.g., 2 over 1NT) or the denomination is higher, with the order being in ascending (or alphabetical) order: , , , , and NT (no trump). Calls may be made orally or with a bidding box.

If the last bid was by the opposing partnership, one may also the opponents&#x27; bid, increasing the penalties for undertricks, but also increasing the reward for making the contract. Doubling does not carry to future bids by the opponents unless future bids are doubled again. A player on the opposing partnership being doubled may also , which increases the penalties and rewards further. Players may not see their partner&#x27;s hand during the auction, only their own. There exist many bidding conventions that assign agreed meanings to various calls to assist players in reaching an optimal contract (or obstruct the opponents).

The auction ends when, after a player bids, doubles, or redoubles, every other player has passed, in which case the action proceeds to the play; or every player has passed and no bid has been made, in which case the round is considered to be &quot;passed out&quot; and not played.

=== Play ===
The player from the declaring side who first bid the denomination named in the final contract becomes declarer. The player left to the declarer leads to the first trick. Dummy then lays his or her cards face-up on the table, organized in columns by suit. Play proceeds clockwise, with each player required to follow suit if possible. Tricks are won by the highest trump, or if there were none played, the highest card of the led suit. The player who won the previous trick leads to the next trick. The declarer has control of the dummy&#x27;s cards and tells his partner which card to play at dummy&#x27;s turn. There also exist conventions that communicate further information between defenders about their hands during the play.

At any time, a player may , stating that their side will win a specific number of the remaining tricks. The claiming player lays his cards down on the table and explains the order in which he intends to play the remaining cards. The opponents can either accept the claim and the round is scored accordingly, or dispute the claim. If the claim is disputed, play continues with the claiming player&#x27;s cards face up in rubber games, or in duplicate games, play ceases and the tournament director is called to adjudicate the hand.

=== Scoring ===

At the end of the hand, points are awarded to the declaring side if they make the contract, or else to the defenders. Partnerships can be , increasing the rewards for making the contract, but also increasing the penalties for undertricks. In rubber bridge, if a side has won 100 contract points, they have won a and are vulnerable for the remaining rounds, but in duplicate bridge, vulnerability is predetermined based on the number of each board.

If the declaring side makes their contract, they receive points for , or tricks bid and made in excess of six. In both rubber and duplicate bridge, the declaring side is awarded 20 points per odd trick for a contract in clubs or diamonds, and 30 points per odd trick for a contract in hearts or spades. For a contract in notrump, the declaring side is awarded 40 points for the first odd trick and 30 points for the remaining odd tricks. Contract points are doubled or quadrupled if the contract is respectively doubled or redoubled.

In rubber bridge, a partnership wins one game once it has accumulated 100 contract points; excess contract points do not carry over to the next game. A partnership that wins two games wins the rubber, receiving a bonus of 500 points if the opponents have won a game, and 700 points if they have not.

Overtricks score the same number of points per odd trick, although their doubled and redoubled values differ. Bonuses vary between the two bridge variations both in score and in type (for example, rubber bridge awards a bonus for holding a certain combination of high cards), although some are common between the two.

A larger bonus is awarded if the declaring side makes a small slam or grand slam, a contract of 12 or 13 tricks respectively. If the declaring side is not vulnerable, a small slam gets 500 points, and a grand slam 1000 points. If the declaring side is vulnerable, a small slam is 750 points and a grand slam is 1,500.

In rubber bridge, the rubber finishes when a partnership has won two games, but the partnership receiving the most &quot;overall&quot; points wins the rubber. Duplicate bridge is scored comparatively, meaning that the score for the hand is compared to other tables playing the same cards and match points are scored according to the comparative results: usually either &quot;matchpoint scoring&quot;, where each partnership receives 2 points (or 1 point) for each pair that they beat, and 1 point (or point) for each tie; or IMPs (international matchpoint) scoring, where the number of IMPs varies (but less than proportionately) with the points difference between the teams.

Undertricks are scored in both variations as follows:
==Rules==
The rules of the game are referred to as the &quot;laws&quot; as promulgated by various bridge organizations.

===Duplicate===
The official rules of duplicate bridge are promulgated by the WBF as &quot;The Laws of Duplicate Bridge 2017&quot;. The Laws Committee of the WBF, composed of world experts, updates the Laws every 10 years; it also issues a Laws Commentary advising on interpretations it has rendered.

In addition to the basic rules of play, there are many additional rules covering playing conditions and the rectification of irregularities, which are primarily for use by tournament directors who act as referees and have overall control of procedures during competitions. But various details of procedure are left to the discretion of the zonal bridge organisation for tournaments under their aegis and some (for example, the choice of &quot;movement&quot;) to the sponsoring organisation (for example, the club).

Some zonal organisations of the WBF also publish editions of the Laws. For example, the American Contract Bridge League (ACBL) publishes the &quot;Laws of Duplicate Bridge&quot; and additional documentation for club and tournament directors.

===Rubber===
There are no universally accepted rules for rubber bridge, but some zonal organisations have published their own. An example for those wishing to abide by a published standard is &quot;The Laws of Rubber Bridge&quot; as published by the American Contract Bridge League.

The majority of rules mirror those of duplicate bridge in the bidding and play and differ primarily in procedures for dealing and scoring.

===Online===
In 2001, the WBF promulgated a set of laws for online play.

==Tournaments==
Bridge is a game of skill played with randomly dealt cards, which makes it also a game of chance, or more exactly, a tactical game with inbuilt randomness, imperfect knowledge and restricted communication. The chance element is in the deal of the cards; in duplicate bridge some of the chance element is eliminated by comparing results of multiple pairs in identical situations. This is achievable when there are eight or more players, sitting at two or more tables, and the deals from each table are preserved and passed to the next table, thereby &quot;duplicating&quot; them for the other table(s) of players. At the end of a session, the scores for each deal are compared, and the most points are awarded to the players doing the best with each particular deal. This measures relative skill (but still with an element of luck) because each pair or team is being judged only on the ability to bid with, and play, the same cards as other players.

Duplicate bridge is played in clubs and tournaments, which can gather as many as several hundred players. Duplicate bridge is a mind sport, and its popularity gradually became comparable to that of chess, with which it is often compared for its complexity and the mental skills required for high-level competition. Bridge and chess are the only &quot;mind sports&quot; recognized by the International Olympic Committee, although they were not found eligible for the main Olympic program. In October 2017 the British High Court ruled against the English Bridge Union, finding that Bridge is not a sport under a definition of sport as involving physical activity, but did not rule on the &quot;broad, somewhat philosophical question&quot; as to whether or not bridge is a sport.

The basic premise of duplicate bridge had previously been used for whist matches as early as 1857. Initially, bridge was not thought to be suitable for duplicate competition; it was not until the 1920s that (auction) bridge tournaments became popular.

In 1925 when contract bridge first evolved, bridge tournaments were becoming popular, but the rules were somewhat in flux, and several different organizing bodies were involved in tournament sponsorship: the American Bridge League (formerly the &quot;American Auction Bridge League&quot;, which changed its name in 1929), the American Whist League, and the United States Bridge Association. In 1935, the first officially recognized world championship was held. In 1958, the World Bridge Federation (WBF) was founded to promote bridge worldwide, coordinate periodic revision to the Laws (each ten years, next in 2027) and conduct world championships.

===Bidding boxes and screens===

In tournaments, &quot;bidding boxes&quot; are frequently used, as noted above. These avoid the possibility of players at other tables hearing any spoken bids. The bidding cards are laid out in sequence as the auction progresses. Although it is not a formal rule, many clubs adopt a protocol that the bidding cards stay revealed until the first playing card is tabled, after which point the bidding cards are put away. Bidding pads are an alternative to bidding boxes. A bidding pad is a block of 100mm square tear-off sheets. Players write their bids on the top sheet. When the first trick is complete the sheet is torn off and discarded.

In top national and international events, &quot;bidding screens&quot; are used. These are placed diagonally across the table, preventing partners from seeing each other during the game; often the screen is removed after the auction is complete.

==Strategy==

===Bidding===
Much of the complexity in bridge arises from the difficulty of arriving at a good final contract in the auction (or deciding to let the opponents declare the contract). This is a difficult problem: the two players in a partnership must try to communicate enough information about their hands to arrive at a makeable contract, but the information they can exchange is restricted – information may be passed only by the calls made and later by the cards played, not by other means; in addition, the agreed-upon meaning of each call and play must be available to the opponents.

Since a partnership that has freedom to bid gradually at leisure can exchange more information, and since a partnership that can interfere with the opponents&#x27; bidding (as by raising the bidding level rapidly) can cause difficulties for their opponents, bidding systems are both informational and strategic. It is this mixture of information exchange and evaluation, deduction, and tactics that is at the heart of bidding in bridge.

A number of basic rules of thumb in bridge bidding and play are summarized as bridge maxims.

====Systems and conventions====
A &quot;bidding system&quot; is a set of partnership agreements on the meanings of bids. A partnership&#x27;s bidding system is usually made up of a core system, modified and complemented by specific conventions (optional customizations incorporated into the main system for handling specific bidding situations) which are pre-chosen between the partners prior to play. The line between a well-known convention and a part of a system is not always clear-cut: some bidding systems include specified conventions by default. Bidding systems can be divided into mainly natural systems such as Acol and Standard American, and mainly artificial systems such as the Precision Club and Polish Club.

Calls are usually considered to be either &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;conventional&quot; (artificial). A natural call carries a meaning that reflects the call; a natural bid intuitively showing hand or suit strength based on the level or suit of the bid, and a natural double expressing that the player believes that the opposing partnership will not make their contract. By contrast, a conventional (artificial) call offers and/or asks for information by means of pre-agreed coded interpretations, in which some calls convey very specific information or requests that are not part of the natural meaning of the call. Thus in response to 4NT, a &#x27;natural&#x27; bid of 5 would state a preference towards a diamond suit or a desire to play in five diamonds, whereas if the partners have agreed to use the common Blackwood convention, a bid of 5 in the same situation would say nothing about the diamond suit, but would tell the partner that the hand in question contains exactly one ace.

Conventions are valuable in bridge because of the need to pass information beyond a simple like or dislike of a particular suit, and because the limited bidding space can be used more efficiently by adopting a conventional (artificial) meaning for a given call where a natural meaning has less utility, because the information it conveys is not valuable or because the desire to convey that information arises only rarely. The conventional meaning conveys more useful (or more frequently useful) information. There are a very large number of conventions from which players can choose; many books have been written detailing bidding conventions. Well-known conventions include Stayman (to ask the opening 1NT bidder to show any four-card major suit), Jacoby transfers (a request by (usually) the weak hand for the partner to bid a particular suit first, and therefore to become the declarer), and the Blackwood convention (to ask for information on the number of aces and kings held, used in slam bidding situations).

The term &quot;preempt&quot; refers to a high-level tactical bid by a weak hand, relying upon a very long suit rather than high cards for tricks. Preemptive bids serve a double purpose – they allow players to indicate they are bidding on the basis of a long suit in an otherwise weak hand, which is important information to share, and they also consume substantial bidding space which prevents a possibly strong opposing pair from exchanging information on their cards. Several systems include the use of opening bids or other early bids with weak hands including long (usually six to eight card) suits at the 2, 3 or even 4 or 5 levels as preempts.

====Basic natural systems====
As a rule, a natural suit bid indicates a holding of at least four (or more, depending on the situation and the system) cards in that suit as an opening bid, or a lesser number when supporting partner; a natural NT bid indicates a balanced hand.

Most systems use a count of high card points as the basic evaluation of the strength of a hand, refining this by reference to shape and distribution if appropriate. In the most commonly used point count system, aces are counted as 4 points, kings as 3, queens as 2, and jacks as 1 point; therefore, the deck contains 40 points. In addition, the &quot;distribution&quot; of the cards in a hand into suits may also contribute to the strength of a hand and be counted as distribution points. A better than average hand, containing 12 or 13 points, is usually considered sufficient to &quot;open&quot; the bidding, i.e., to make the first bid in the auction. A combination of two such hands (i.e., 25 or 26 points shared between partners) is often sufficient for a partnership to bid, and generally to make, game in a major suit or notrump (more are usually needed for a minor suit game, as the level is higher).

In natural systems, a 1NT opening bid usually reflects a hand that has a relatively balanced shape (usually between two and four (or less often five) cards in each suit) and a sharply limited number of high card points, usually somewhere between 12 and 18 – the most common ranges use a span of exactly three points (for example, 12–14, 15–17 or 16–18), but some systems use a four-point range, usually 15–18.

Opening bids of three or higher are preemptive bids, i.e., bids made with weak hands that especially favor a particular suit, opened at a high level in order to define the hand&#x27;s value quickly and to frustrate the opposition. For example, a hand of would be a candidate for an opening bid of 3, designed to make it difficult for the opposing team to bid and find their optimum contract even if they have the bulk of the points. This hand is nearly valueless unless spades are trumps but it contains good enough spades that the penalty for being set should not be higher than the value of an opponent game. The high card weakness makes it likely that the opponents have enough strength to make game themselves.

Openings at the 2 level are either unusually strong (2NT, natural, and 2, artificial) or preemptive, depending on the system. Unusually strong bids communicate an especially high number of points (normally 20 or more) or a high trick-taking potential (normally 8 or more). Also 2 as the strongest (by HCP and by DP+HCP) has become more common, perhaps especially at websites that offer duplicate bridge. Here the 2 opening is used for either hands with a good 6-card suit or longer (max one losing card) and a total of 18 HCP up to 23 total points – or &quot;NT&quot;, like 2NT but with 22–23 HCP. Whilst the 2 opening bid takes care of all hands with 24 points (HCP or with distribution points included) with the only exception of &quot;Gambling 3NT&quot;.

Opening bids at the one level are made with hands containing 12–13 points or more and which are not suitable for one of the preceding bids. Using Standard American with 5-card majors, opening hearts or spades usually promises a 5-card suit. Partnerships who agree to play 5-card majors open a minor suit with 4-card majors and then bid their major suit at the next opportunity. This means that an opening bid of 1 or 1 will sometimes be made with only 3 cards in that suit.

Doubles are sometimes given conventional meanings in otherwise mostly natural systems. A natural, or &quot;penalty&quot; double, is one used to try to gain extra points when the defenders are confident of setting (defeating) the contract. The most common example of a conventional double is the takeout double of a low-level suit bid, implying support for the unbid suits or the unbid major suits and asking partner to choose one of them.

====Basic variations====
Bidding systems depart from these basic ideas in varying degrees. Standard American, for instance, is a collection of conventions designed to bolster the accuracy and power of these basic ideas, while Precision Club is a system that uses the 1 opening bid for all or almost all strong hands (but sets the threshold for &quot;strong&quot; rather lower than most other systems – usually 16 high card points) and may include other artificial calls to handle other situations (but it may contain natural calls as well). Many experts today use a system called 2/1 game forcing (enunciated as two over one game forcing), which amongst other features adds some complexity to the treatment of the one notrump response as used in Standard American. In the UK, Acol is the most common system; its main features are a weak one notrump opening with 12–14 high card points and several variations for 2-level openings.

There are also a variety of advanced techniques used for hand evaluation. The most basic is the Milton Work point count, (the 4-3-2-1 system detailed above) but this is sometimes modified in various ways, or either augmented or replaced by other approaches such as losing trick count, honor point count, law of total tricks, or Zar Points.

Common conventions and variations within natural systems include:
* &quot;Blackwood&quot; (either the original version or &quot;Roman Key Card&quot;)
* How the partnership&#x27;s bidding practices will be varied if their opponents intervene or compete.
* Point count required for 1 NT opening bid (&#x27;mini&#x27; 10–12, &#x27;weak&#x27; 12–14, &#x27;strong&#x27; 15–17 or 16–18)
* &quot;Stayman&quot; (together with Blackwood, described as &quot;the two most famous conventions in Bridge&quot;.)
* What types of &quot;cue bids (e.g. bidding the opponents&#x27; suit)&quot; the partnership will play, if any.
* Whether 1 (and sometimes 1) is &#x27;natural&#x27; or &#x27;suspect&#x27; &quot;(also called &#x27;phoney&#x27; or &#x27;short&#x27;)&quot;, signifying an opening hand lacking a notable heart or spade suit
* Whether an opening bid of 1 and 1 requires a minimum of 4 or 5 cards in the suit (&quot;4 or 5 card majors&quot;)
* Whether doubling a contract at the 1, 2 and sometimes higher levels signifies a belief that the opponents&#x27; contract will fail and a desire to raise the stakes (a &quot;penalty double&quot;), or an indication of strength but no biddable suit coupled with a request that partner bid something (a &quot;takeout double&quot;).
* Whether doubling or overcalling over opponents&#x27; 1NT is natural or conventional. One common artificial agreement is Cappelletti, where 2 is a transfer to be passed or corrected to a major, 2 means both majors and a major shows that suit plus a minor.
* Whether opening bids at the two level are &#x27;strong&#x27; (20+ points) or &#x27;weak&#x27; (i.e., pre-emptive with a 6 card suit). (Note: an opening bid of 2 is usually played in otherwise natural systems as conventional, signifying any exceptionally strong hand)
* Whether the partnership will play &quot;Jacoby transfers&quot; (bids of 2 and 2 over 1NT or 3 and 3 over 2NT respectively require the 1NT or 2NT bidder to rebid 2 and 2 or 3 and 3), &quot;minor suit transfers&quot; (bids of 2 and either 2NT or 3 over 1NT respectively require the 1NT bidder to bid 3 and 3) and &quot;Texas transfers&quot; (bids of 4 and 4 respectively require the 1NT, or 2NT bidder to rebid 4 and 4)
* Which (if any) bids are &quot;forcing&quot; and require a response.

Within play, it is also commonly agreed what systems of opening leads, signals and discards will be played:
* Conventions for the opening lead govern how the first card to be played will be chosen and what it will mean,
* Count signals cover the situation when a defender is following suit (usually to a suit that the declarer has led). In such circumstances the order in which a defender plays his spot cards will indicate whether an even or odd number of cards was originally held in that suit. This can help the other defender count out the entire original distribution of the cards in that suit. It is sometimes critical to know this when defending.
* Discards cover the situation when a defender cannot follow suit and therefore has free choice what card to play or throw away. In such circumstances the thrown-away card can be used to indicate some aspect of the hand, or a desire for a specific suit to be played.
* Signals indicate how cards played within a suit are chosen – for example, playing a noticeably high card when this is unexpected can signal encouragement to continue playing the suit, and a low card can signal discouragement and a desire for partner to choose some other suit. (Some partnerships use &quot;reverse&quot; signals, meaning that a noticeably high card &quot;discourages&quot; that suit and a noticeably low card &quot;encourages&quot; that suit, thus not &quot;wasting&quot; a potentially useful intermediate card in the suit of interest.)
* Suit preference signals cover the situation where a defender is returning a suit which will be ruffed by his partner. If he plays a high card he is showing an entry in the higher side suit and vice versa. There are some other situations where this tool may be used.
* Surrogate signals cover the situation when it is critical to show length in a side suit and it will be too late if defenders wait until that suit is played. Then, the play in the first declarer played suit is a count signal regarding the critical suit and not the trump suit itself. In fact, any signal made about a suit in another suit might be called as such.

====Advanced techniques====
Every call (including &quot;pass&quot;, also sometimes called &quot;no bid&quot;) serves two purposes. It confirms or passes some information to a partner, and, by implication, denies any other kind of hand which would have tended to support an alternative call. For example, a bid of 2NT immediately after partner&#x27;s 1NT not only shows a balanced hand of a certain point range, but also almost always denies possession of a five-card major suit (otherwise the player would have bid it) or even a four card major suit (in that case, the player should use the Stayman convention).

Likewise, in some partnerships the bid of 2 in the sequence 1NT–2–2–2 between partners (opponents passing throughout) explicitly shows five hearts but also confirms four cards in spades: the bidder must hold at least five hearts to make it worth looking for a heart fit after 2 denied a four card major, and with at least five hearts, a Stayman bid must have been justified by having exactly four spades, the other major (since Stayman (as used by this partnership) is not useful with anything except a four card major suit). Thus an astute partner can read much more than the surface meaning into the bidding. Alternatively, many partnerships play this same bidding sequence as &quot;Crawling Stayman&quot; by which the responder shows a weak hand (less than eight high card points) with shortness in diamonds but at least four hearts and four spades; the opening bidder may correct to spades if that appears to be the better contract.

The situations detailed here are extremely simple examples; many instances of advanced bidding involve specific agreements related to very specific situations and subtle inferences regarding entire sequences of calls.

===Play techniques===
Terence Reese, a prolific author of bridge books, points out that there are only four ways of taking a trick by force, two of which are very easy:
* establishing long suits (the last cards in a suit will take tricks if the opponents do not have the suit and are unable to trump)
* playing a high card that no one else can beat
* playing for the opponents&#x27; high cards to be in a particular position (if their ace is to the right of your king, your king may be able to take a trick, especially if, when that suit is led, the player to your right has to play their card before you do)
* trumping an opponent&#x27;s high card

Nearly all trick-taking techniques in bridge can be reduced to one of these four methods. The optimum play of the cards can require much thought and experience and is the subject of whole books on bridge.

==Example==
The cards are dealt as shown in the bridge hand diagram; North is the dealer and starts the auction which proceeds as shown in the bidding table.
As neither North nor East have sufficient strength to &quot;open&quot; the bidding, they each pass, denying such strength. South, next in turn, opens with the bid of 1, which denotes a reasonable heart suit (at least 4 or 5 cards long, depending on the bidding system) and at least 12 high card points. On this hand, South has 14 high card points. West &quot;overcalls&quot; with 1, since he has a long spade suit of reasonable quality and 10 high card points (an overcall can be made on a hand that is not quite strong enough for an opening bid). North &quot;supports&quot; partner&#x27;s suit with 2, showing heart support and about points. East supports spades with 2. South inserts a &quot;game try&quot; of 3, &quot;inviting&quot; the partner to bid the &quot;game&quot; of 4 with good club support and overall values. North complies, as North is at the higher end of the range for his 2 bid, and has a fourth trump (the 2 bid promised only three), and the &quot;doubleton&quot; queen of clubs to fit with partner&#x27;s strength there. (North could instead have bid 3, indicating not enough strength for game, asking South to pass and so play 3.)

In the auction, north–south are trying to investigate whether their cards are sufficient to make a game (nine tricks at notrump, ten tricks in hearts or spades, 11 tricks in clubs or diamonds), which yields bonus points if bid and made. East-West are &quot;competing&quot; in spades, hoping to play a contract in spades at a low level. 4 is the final contract, 10 tricks being required for to make with hearts as trump.

South is the &quot;declarer&quot;, having been first to bid hearts, and the player to South&#x27;s left, West, has to choose the first card in the play, known as the &quot;opening lead&quot;. West chooses the spade king because spades is the suit the partnership has shown strength in, and because they have agreed that when they hold two &quot;touching honors&quot; (or &quot;adjacent honors&quot;) they will play the higher one first. West plays the card face down, to give their partner and the declarer (but not dummy) a chance to ask any last questions about the bidding or to object if they believe West is not the correct hand to lead. After that, North&#x27;s cards are laid on the table and North becomes &quot;dummy&quot;, as both the North and South hands will be controlled by the declarer. West turns the lead card face up, and the declarer studies the two hands to make a plan for the play. On this hand, the trump ace, a spade, and a diamond trick must be lost, so declarer must not lose a trick in clubs.

If the K is held by West, South will find it very hard to prevent it from making a trick (unless West leads a club). There is an almost equal chance that it is held by East, in which case it can be trapped against the ace, and will be beaten, using a tactic known as a &quot;finesse&quot;.

After considering the cards, the declarer directs dummy (North) to play a small spade. East plays &quot;low&quot; (small card) and South takes the A, gaining the &quot;lead&quot;. (South may also elect to &quot;duck&quot;, but for the purpose of this example, let us assume South wins the A at trick 1). South proceeds by &quot;drawing trump&quot;, leading the K. West decides there is no benefit to holding back, and so wins the trick with the ace, and then cashes the Q. For fear of conceding a &quot;ruff and discard&quot;, West plays the 2 instead of another spade. Declarer plays low from the table, and East scores the Q. Not having anything better to do, East returns the remaining trump, taken in South&#x27;s hand. The trumps now accounted for, South can now execute the finesse, perhaps trapping the king as planned. South &quot;enters&quot; the dummy (i.e. wins a trick in the dummy&#x27;s hand) by leading a low diamond, using dummy&#x27;s A to win the trick, and leads the Q from dummy to the next trick. East &quot;covers&quot; the queen with the king, and South takes the trick with the ace, and proceeds by &quot;cashing&quot; the remaining &quot;master&quot; J. (If East does not play the king, then South will play a low club from South&#x27;s hand and the queen will win anyway, this being the essence of the finesse). The game is now safe: South &quot;ruffs&quot; a small club with a dummy&#x27;s trump, then ruffs a diamond in hand for an &quot;entry&quot; back, and ruffs the last club in dummy (sometimes described as a &quot;crossruff&quot;). Finally, South &quot;claims&quot; the remaining tricks by showing his or her hand, as it now contains only high trumps and there&#x27;s no need to play the hand out to prove they are all winners.

(The trick-by-trick notation used above can be also expressed in tabular form, but a textual explanation is usually preferred in practice, for reader&#x27;s convenience. Plays of small cards or &quot;discards&quot; are often omitted from such a description, unless they were important for the outcome).

North-South score the required 10 tricks, and their opponents take the remaining three. The contract is fulfilled, and North enters the pair numbers, the contract, and the score of +420 for the winning side (North is in charge of bookkeeping in duplicate tournaments) on the traveling sheet. North asks East to check the score entered on the traveller. All players return their own cards to the board, and the next deal is played.

On the prior hand, it is quite possible that the K is held by West. For example, by swapping the K and A between the defending hands. Then the 4 contract would fail by one trick (unless West had led a club early in the play). The failure of the contract would not mean that 4 was a bad contract on this hand. The contract depends on the club finesse working, or a defense error. The bonus points awarded for making a game contract far outweigh the penalty for going one off, so it is best strategy in the long run to bid game contracts such as this one.

Similarly, there is a minuscule chance that the K is in the west hand, but the west hand has no other clubs. In that case, declarer can succeed by simply cashing the A, felling the K and setting up the Q as a winner. The chance of this is far lower than the chance that East started with the K. Therefore, the superior percentage play is to take the club finesse, as described above.

==Computers==
After many years of little progress, computer bridge made great progress at the end of the 20th century. In 1996, the ACBL initiated the official World Championships Computer Bridge, to be held annually along with a major bridge event. The first Computer Bridge Championship took place in 1997 at the North American Bridge Championships in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

===Stand-alone software===
Strong bridge playing programs such as Jack Bridge (World Champion in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2015) and Wbridge5 (World Champion in 2005, 2007, 2008, 2016, 2017 and 2018), probably rank among the top few thousand human pairs worldwide. A series of articles published in 2005 and 2006 in the Dutch bridge magazine IMP describes matches between Jack Bridge and seven top Dutch pairs. A total of 196 boards were played. Jack Bridge lost, but by a small margin (359 versus 385 IMPs).

===Online play===
There are several free and subscription-based services available for playing bridge on the internet. For example:

* Bridge Base Online (BBO) is the most active online bridge club in the world, with more than 100,000 daily connections and 500,000 hands played each day, in part because it is free to play casual games and volunteer-run tournaments (though most tournaments charge an entry fee). The company is part of French-owned e-gaming group 52 Entertainment.
* Funbridge is a mobile and web application where users can play deals against robots. The company was started in France and is now owned by GOTO Games which is part of 52 Entertainment.
* OKbridge is the oldest extant internet bridge service: it was established as a commercial enterprise in 1994, but the program started to be used interactively in August 1990 by players of all standards. OKbridge is a subscription-based club, with services such as customer support and ethics reviews.
* RealBridge was launched in November 2020. Its online platform includes built-in audio and video. It is primarily used for organised bridge, ranging from club-level games to national, zonal and world championships. It includes teaching functionality, and provides MiniBridge as an option.
* Sharkbridge founded in 2020 by Milen Milkovski (Canada), Plamen Panayotov (Canada), John Norris ( Denmark) and Michael Woywode (Germany).
* SWAN Games was founded April 2000. In March 2004, announced a partnership to provide internet services to SBF members and is a competitor in subscription-based online bridge clubs.
* BridgeClubLive is a subscription based club which was founded in 1994 with the Bridge Player Live Software for Windows.
* Bridge Champ was launched in 2023. It includes both browser-based and mobile apps and supports various tournament types, including bots, individuals, and teams. 

Some national contract bridge organizations now offer online bridge play to their members, including the English Bridge Union, the Dutch Bridge Federation and the Australian Bridge Federation. MSN and Yahoo! Games have several online rubber bridge rooms. In 2001, the WBF issued a special edition of the lawbook adapted for internet and other electronic forms of the game.

<text>A boat is a watercraft of a large range of types and sizes, but generally smaller than a ship, which is distinguished by its larger size or capacity, its shape, or its ability to carry boats.

Small boats are typically used on inland waterways such as rivers and lakes, or in protected coastal areas. However, some boats (such as whaleboats) were intended for offshore use. In modern naval terms, a boat is a vessel small enough to be carried aboard a ship.

Boats vary in proportion and construction methods with their intended purpose, available materials, or local traditions. Canoes have been used since prehistoric times and remain in use throughout the world for transportation, fishing, and sport. Fishing boats vary widely in style partly to match local conditions. Pleasure craft used in recreational boating include ski boats, pontoon boats, and sailboats. House boats may be used for vacationing or long-term residence. Lighters are used to move cargo to and from large ships unable to get close to shore. Lifeboats have rescue and safety functions.

Boats can be propelled by manpower (e.g. rowboats and paddle boats), wind (e.g. sailboats), and inboard/outboard motors (including gasoline, diesel, and electric).

== History ==

===Differentiation from other prehistoric watercraft===
The earliest watercraft are considered to have been rafts. These would have been used for voyages such as the settlement of Australia sometime between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago.

A boat differs from a raft by obtaining its buoyancy by having most of its structure exclude water with a waterproof layer, e.g. the planks of a wooden hull, the hide covering (or tarred canvas) of a currach. In contrast, a raft is buoyant because it joins components that are themselves buoyant, for example, logs, bamboo poles, bundles of reeds, floats (such as inflated hides, sealed pottery containers or, in a modern context, empty oil drums). The key difference between a raft and a boat is that the former is a &quot;flow through&quot; structure, with waves able to pass up through it. Consequently, except for short river crossings, a raft is not a practical means of transport in colder regions of the world as the users would be at risk of hypothermia. Today that climatic limitation restricts rafts to between 40° north and 40° south, with, in the past, similar boundaries that have moved as the world&#x27;s climate has varied.

===Types===
The earliest boats may have been either dugouts or hide boats. The oldest recovered boat in the world, the Pesse canoe, found in the Netherlands, is a dugout made from the hollowed tree trunk of a &quot;Pinus sylvestris&quot; that was constructed somewhere between 8200 and 7600 BC. This canoe is exhibited in the Drents Museum in Assen, Netherlands. Other very old dugout boats have also been recovered. Hide boats, made from covering a framework with animal skins, could be equally as old as logboats, but such a structure is much less likely to survive in an archaeological context.

Plank-built boats are considered, in most cases, to have developed from the logboat. There are examples of logboats that have been expanded: by deforming the hull under the influence of heat, by raising up the sides with added planks, or by splitting down the middle and adding a central plank to make it wider. (Some of these methods have been in quite recent usethere is no simple developmental sequence). The earliest known plank-built boats are from the Nile, dating to the third millennium BC. Outside Egypt, the next earliest are from England. The Ferriby boats are dated to the early part of the second millennium BC and the end of the third millennium. Plank-built boats require a level of woodworking technology that was first available in the neolithic with more complex versions only becoming achievable in the Bronze Age.

==Types==
Boats can be categorized by their means of propulsion. These divide into:
# Unpowered. This involves drifting with the tide or a river current.
# Powered by the crew-members on board, using oars, paddles or a punting pole or quant.
# Powered by sail.
# Towedeither by humans or animals from a river or canal bank (or in very shallow water, by walking on the sea or river bed) or by another vessel.
# Powered by machinery, such as internal combustion engines, steam engines or by batteries and an electric motor.&lt;br&gt;Any one vessel may use more than one of these methods at different times or in combination.

A number of large vessels are usually referred to as boats. Submarines are a prime example. Other types of large vessels which are traditionally called boats include Great Lakes freighters, riverboats, and ferryboats. Though large enough to carry their own boats and heavy cargo, these vessels are designed for operation on inland or protected coastal waters.

==Terminology==

The hull is the main, and in some cases only, structural component of a boat. It provides both capacity and buoyancy. The keel is a boat&#x27;s &quot;backbone&quot;, a lengthwise structural member to which the perpendicular frames are fixed. On some boats, a deck covers the hull, in part or whole. While a ship often has several decks, a boat is unlikely to have more than one. Above the deck are often lifelines connected to stanchions, bulwarks perhaps topped by gunnels, or some combination of the two. A cabin may protrude above the deck forward, aft, along the centerline, or cover much of the length of the boat. Vertical structures dividing the internal spaces are known as bulkheads.

The forward end of a boat is called the bow, the aft end the stern. Facing forward the right side is referred to as starboard and the left side as port.

== Building materials ==


Until the mid-19th century, most boats were made of natural materials, primarily wood, although bark and animal skins were also used. Early boats include the birch bark canoe, the animal hide-covered kayak and coracle and the dugout canoe made from a single log.

By the mid-19th century, some boats had been built with iron or steel frames but still planked in wood. In 1855 ferro-cement boat construction was patented by the French, who coined the name &quot;ferciment&quot;. This is a system by which a steel or iron wire framework is built in the shape of a boat&#x27;s hull and covered over with cement. Reinforced with bulkheads and other internal structures it is strong but heavy, easily repaired, and, if sealed properly, will not leak or corrode.

As the forests of Britain and Europe continued to be over-harvested to supply the keels of larger wooden boats, and the Bessemer process (patented in 1855) cheapened the cost of steel, steel ships and boats began to be more common. By the 1930s boats built entirely of steel from frames to plating were seen replacing wooden boats in many industrial uses and fishing fleets. Private recreational boats of steel remain uncommon. In 1895 WH Mullins produced steel boats of galvanized iron and by 1930 became the world&#x27;s largest producer of pleasure boats.

Mullins also offered boats in aluminum from 1895 through 1899 and once again in the 1920s, but it was not until the mid-20th century that aluminium gained widespread popularity. Though much more expensive than steel, aluminum alloys exist that do not corrode in salt water, allowing a similar load carrying capacity to steel at much less weight.

Around the mid-1960s, boats made of fiberglass (aka &quot;glass fiber&quot;) became popular, especially for recreational boats. Fiberglass is also known as &quot;GRP&quot; (glass-reinforced plastic) in the UK, and &quot;FRP&quot; (for fiber-reinforced plastic) in the US. Fiberglass boats are strong and do not rust, corrode, or rot. Instead, they are susceptible to structural degradation from sunlight and extremes in temperature over their lifespan. Fiberglass structures can be made stiffer with sandwich panels, where the fiberglass encloses a lightweight core such as balsa or foam.

Cold molding is a modern construction method, using wood as the structural component. In one cold molding process, very thin strips of wood are layered over a form. Each layer is coated with resin, followed by another directionally alternating layer laid on top. Subsequent layers may be stapled or otherwise mechanically fastened to the previous, or weighted or vacuum bagged to provide compression and stabilization until the resin sets. An alternative process uses thin sheets of plywood shaped over a disposable male mold, and coated with epoxy.

==Propulsion==

The most common means of boat propulsion are as follows:
* Engine
** Inboard motor
** Stern drive (Inboard/outboard)
** Outboard motor
** Paddle wheel
** Water jet (jetboat, personal water craft)
** Fan (hovercraft, air boat)
* Man (rowing, paddling, setting pole etc.)
* Wind (sailing)

==Buoyancy==
A boat displaces its weight in water, regardless whether it is made of wood, steel, fiberglass, or even concrete. If weight is added to the boat, the volume of the hull drawn below the waterline will increase to keep the balance above and below the surface equal. Boats have a natural or designed level of buoyancy. Exceeding it will cause the boat first to ride lower in the water, second to take on water more readily than when properly loaded, and ultimately, if overloaded by any combination of structure, cargo, and water, sink.

As commercial vessels must be correctly loaded to be safe, and as the sea becomes less buoyant in brackish areas such as the Baltic, the Plimsoll line was introduced to prevent overloading.

==European Union classification==
Since 1998 all new leisure boats and barges built in Europe between 2.5m and 24m must comply with the EU&#x27;s Recreational Craft Directive (RCD). The Directive establishes four categories that permit the allowable wind and wave conditions for vessels in each class:
*Class A - the boat may safely navigate any waters.
*Class B - the boat is limited to offshore navigation. (Winds up to Force 8 &amp; waves up to 4 metres) 
*Class C - the boat is limited to inshore (coastal) navigation. (Winds up to Force 6 &amp; waves up to 2 metres) 
*Class D - the boat is limited to rivers, canals and small lakes. (Winds up to Force 4 &amp; waves up to 0.5 metres)
Europe is the main producer of recreational boats (the second production in the world is located in Poland). European brands are known all over the world - in fact, these are the brands that created RCD and set the standard for shipyards around the world.

<text>Blood is a body fluid in the circulatory system of humans and other vertebrates that delivers necessary substances such as nutrients and oxygen to the cells, and transports metabolic waste products away from those same cells.

Blood is composed of blood cells suspended in blood plasma. Plasma, which constitutes 55% of blood fluid, is mostly water (92% by volume), and contains proteins, glucose, mineral ions, and hormones. The blood cells are mainly red blood cells (erythrocytes), white blood cells (leukocytes), and (in mammals) platelets (thrombocytes). The most abundant cells are red blood cells. These contain hemoglobin, which facilitates oxygen transport by reversibly binding to it, increasing its solubility. Jawed vertebrates have an adaptive immune system, based largely on white blood cells. White blood cells help to resist infections and parasites. Platelets are important in the clotting of blood.

Blood is circulated around the body through blood vessels by the pumping action of the heart. In animals with lungs, arterial blood carries oxygen from inhaled air to the tissues of the body, and venous blood carries carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism produced by cells, from the tissues to the lungs to be exhaled. Blood is bright red when its hemoglobin is oxygenated and dark red when it is deoxygenated.

Medical terms related to blood often begin with &quot;hemo-&quot;, &quot;hemato-&quot;, &quot;haemo-&quot; or &quot;haemato-&quot; from the Greek word (&quot;&quot;) for &quot;blood&quot;. In terms of anatomy and histology, blood is considered a specialized form of connective tissue, given its origin in the bones and the presence of potential molecular fibers in the form of fibrinogen.

==Functions==

Blood performs many important functions within the body, including:
* Supply of oxygen to tissues (bound to hemoglobin, which is carried in red cells)
* Supply of nutrients such as glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids (dissolved in the blood or bound to plasma proteins (e.g., blood lipids))
* Removal of waste such as carbon dioxide, urea, and lactic acid
* Immunological functions, including circulation of white blood cells, and detection of foreign material by antibodies
* Coagulation, the response to a broken blood vessel, the conversion of blood from a liquid to a semisolid gel to stop bleeding
* Messenger functions, including the transport of hormones and the signaling of tissue damage
* Regulation of core body temperature
* Hydraulic functions

==Constituents==
===In mammals===
Blood accounts for 7% of the human body weight, with an average density around 1060 kg/m3, very close to pure water&#x27;s density of 1000 kg/m3. The average adult has a blood volume of roughly or 1.3 gallons, which is composed of plasma and &quot;formed elements&quot;. The formed elements are the two types of blood cell or &quot;corpuscle&quot; – the red blood cells, (erythrocytes) and white blood cells (leukocytes), and the cell fragments called platelets that are involved in clotting. By volume, the red blood cells constitute about 45% of whole blood, the plasma about 54.3%, and white cells about 0.7%.

Whole blood (plasma and cells) exhibits non-Newtonian fluid dynamics.

====Cells====

One microliter of blood contains:
* 4.7 to 6.1 million (male), 4.2 to 5.4 million (female) erythrocytes: Red blood cells contain the blood&#x27;s hemoglobin and distribute oxygen. Mature red blood cells lack a nucleus and organelles in mammals. The red blood cells (together with endothelial vessel cells and other cells) are also marked by glycoproteins that define the different blood types. The proportion of blood occupied by red blood cells is referred to as the hematocrit, and is normally about 45%. The combined surface area of all red blood cells of the human body would be roughly 2,000 times as great as the body&#x27;s exterior surface.
* 4,000–11,000 leukocytes: White blood cells are part of the body&#x27;s immune system; they destroy and remove old or aberrant cells and cellular debris, as well as attack infectious agents (pathogens) and foreign substances. The cancer of leukocytes is called leukemia.
* 200,000–500,000 thrombocytes: Also called platelets, they take part in blood clotting (coagulation). Fibrin from the coagulation cascade creates a mesh over the platelet plug.


====Plasma====

About 55% of blood is blood plasma, a fluid that is the blood&#x27;s liquid medium, which by itself is straw-yellow in color. The blood plasma volume totals of 2.7–3.0 liters (2.8–3.2 quarts) in an average human. It is essentially an aqueous solution containing 92% water, 8% blood plasma proteins, and trace amounts of other materials. Plasma circulates dissolved nutrients, such as glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids (dissolved in the blood or bound to plasma proteins), and removes waste products, such as carbon dioxide, urea, and lactic acid.

Other important components include:
* Serum albumin
* Blood-clotting factors (to facilitate coagulation)
* Immunoglobulins (antibodies)
* lipoprotein particles
* Various other proteins
* Various electrolytes (mainly sodium and chloride)

The term serum refers to plasma from which the clotting proteins have been removed. Most of the proteins remaining are albumin and immunoglobulins.

====Acidity====
Blood pH is regulated to stay within the narrow range of 7.35 to 7.45, making it slightly basic (compensation). Extra-cellular fluid in blood that has a pH below 7.35 is too acidic, whereas blood pH above 7.45 is too basic. A pH below 6.9 or above 7.8 is usually lethal. Blood pH, partial pressure of oxygen (pO2), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2), and bicarbonate (HCO3−) are carefully regulated by a number of homeostatic mechanisms, which exert their influence principally through the respiratory system and the urinary system to control the acid–base balance and respiration, which is called compensation. An arterial blood gas test measures these. Plasma also circulates hormones transmitting their messages to various tissues. The list of normal reference ranges for various blood electrolytes is extensive.

===In non-mammals===


Human blood is typical of that of mammals, although the precise details concerning cell numbers, size, protein structure, and so on, vary somewhat between species. In non-mammalian vertebrates, however, there are some key differences:
* Red blood cells of non-mammalian vertebrates are flattened and ovoid in form, and retain their cell nuclei.
* There is considerable variation in the types and proportions of white blood cells; for example, acidophils are generally more common than in humans.
* Platelets are unique to mammals; in other vertebrates, small nucleated, spindle cells called thrombocytes are responsible for blood clotting instead.

==Physiology==
===Circulatory system===

Blood is circulated around the body through blood vessels by the pumping action of the heart. In humans, blood is pumped from the strong left ventricle of the heart through arteries to peripheral tissues and returns to the right atrium of the heart through veins. It then enters the right ventricle and is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs and returns to the left atrium through the pulmonary veins. Blood then enters the left ventricle to be circulated again. Arterial blood carries oxygen from inhaled air to all of the cells of the body, and venous blood carries carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism by cells, to the lungs to be exhaled. However, one exception includes pulmonary arteries, which contain the most deoxygenated blood in the body, while the pulmonary veins contain oxygenated blood.

Additional return flow may be generated by the movement of skeletal muscles, which can compress veins and push blood through the valves in veins toward the right atrium.

The blood circulation was famously described by William Harvey in 1628.

===Cell production and degradation===
In vertebrates, the various cells of blood are made in the bone marrow in a process called hematopoiesis, which includes erythropoiesis, the production of red blood cells; and myelopoiesis, the production of white blood cells and platelets. During childhood, almost every human bone produces red blood cells; as adults, red blood cell production is limited to the larger bones: the bodies of the vertebrae, the breastbone (sternum), the ribcage, the pelvic bones, and the bones of the upper arms and legs. In addition, during childhood, the thymus gland, found in the mediastinum, is an important source of T lymphocytes.
The proteinaceous component of blood (including clotting proteins) is produced predominantly by the liver, while hormones are produced by the endocrine glands and the watery fraction is regulated by the hypothalamus and maintained by the kidney.

Healthy erythrocytes have a plasma life of about 120 days before they are degraded by the spleen, and the Kupffer cells in the liver. The liver also clears some proteins, lipids, and amino acids. The kidney actively secretes waste products into the urine.

===Oxygen transport===
About 98.5% of the oxygen in a sample of arterial blood in a healthy human breathing air at sea-level pressure is chemically combined with the hemoglobin. About 1.5% is physically dissolved in the other blood liquids and not connected to hemoglobin. The hemoglobin molecule is the primary transporter of oxygen in mammals and many other species. Hemoglobin has an oxygen binding capacity between 1.36 and 1.40 ml O2 per gram hemoglobin, which increases the total blood oxygen capacity seventyfold, compared to if oxygen solely were carried by its solubility of 0.03 ml O2 per liter blood per mm Hg partial pressure of oxygen (about 100 mm Hg in arteries).

With the exception of pulmonary and umbilical arteries and their corresponding veins, arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart and deliver it to the body via arterioles and capillaries, where the oxygen is consumed; afterwards, venules and veins carry deoxygenated blood back to the heart.

Under normal conditions in adult humans at rest, hemoglobin in blood leaving the lungs is about 98–99% saturated with oxygen, achieving an oxygen delivery between 950 and 1150 ml/min to the body. In a healthy adult at rest, oxygen consumption is approximately 200–250 ml/min, and deoxygenated blood returning to the lungs is still roughly 75% (70 to 78%) saturated. Increased oxygen consumption during sustained exercise reduces the oxygen saturation of venous blood, which can reach less than 15% in a trained athlete; although breathing rate and blood flow increase to compensate, oxygen saturation in arterial blood can drop to 95% or less under these conditions. Oxygen saturation this low is considered dangerous in an individual at rest (for instance, during surgery under anesthesia). Sustained hypoxia (oxygenation less than 90%), is dangerous to health, and severe hypoxia (saturations less than 30%) may be rapidly fatal.

A fetus, receiving oxygen via the placenta, is exposed to much lower oxygen pressures (about 21% of the level found in an adult&#x27;s lungs), so fetuses produce another form of hemoglobin with a much higher affinity for oxygen (hemoglobin F) to function under these conditions.

===Carbon dioxide transport===
CO2 is carried in blood in three different ways. (The exact percentages vary depending whether it is arterial or venous blood). Most of it (about 70%) is converted to bicarbonate ions by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase in the red blood cells by the reaction ; about 7% is dissolved in the plasma; and about 23% is bound to hemoglobin as carbamino compounds.

Hemoglobin, the main oxygen-carrying molecule in red blood cells, carries both oxygen and carbon dioxide. However, the CO2 bound to hemoglobin does not bind to the same site as oxygen. Instead, it combines with the N-terminal groups on the four globin chains. However, because of allosteric effects on the hemoglobin molecule, the binding of CO2 decreases the amount of oxygen that is bound for a given partial pressure of oxygen. The decreased binding to carbon dioxide in the blood due to increased oxygen levels is known as the Haldane effect, and is important in the transport of carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs. A rise in the partial pressure of CO2 or a lower pH will cause offloading of oxygen from hemoglobin, which is known as the Bohr effect.

===Transport of hydrogen ions===
Some oxyhemoglobin loses oxygen and becomes deoxyhemoglobin. Deoxyhemoglobin binds most of the hydrogen ions as it has a much greater affinity for more hydrogen than does oxyhemoglobin.

===Lymphatic system===

In mammals, blood is in equilibrium with lymph, which is continuously formed in tissues from blood by capillary ultrafiltration. Lymph is collected by a system of small lymphatic vessels and directed to the thoracic duct, which drains into the left subclavian vein, where lymph rejoins the systemic blood circulation.

===Thermoregulation===
Blood circulation transports heat throughout the body, and adjustments to this flow are an important part of thermoregulation. Increasing blood flow to the surface (e.g., during warm weather or strenuous exercise) causes warmer skin, resulting in faster heat loss. In contrast, when the external temperature is low, blood flow to the extremities and surface of the skin is reduced and to prevent heat loss and is circulated to the important organs of the body, preferentially.

=== Rate of flow ===
Rate of blood flow varies greatly between different organs. Liver has the most abundant blood supply with an approximate flow of 1350 ml/min. Kidney and brain are the second and the third most supplied organs, with 1100 ml/min and ~700 ml/min, respectively.

Relative rates of blood flow per 100 g of tissue are different, with kidney, adrenal gland and thyroid being the first, second and third most supplied tissues, respectively.

===Hydraulic functions===
The restriction of blood flow can also be used in specialized tissues to cause engorgement, resulting in an erection of that tissue; examples are the erectile tissue in the penis and clitoris.

Another example of a hydraulic function is the jumping spider, in which blood forced into the legs under pressure causes them to straighten for a powerful jump, without the need for bulky muscular legs.

==Color==


Hemoglobin is the principal determinant of the color of blood (hemochrome). Each molecule has four heme groups, and their interaction with various molecules alters the exact color. Arterial blood and capillary blood are bright red, as oxygen imparts a strong red color to the heme group. Deoxygenated blood is a darker shade of red; this is present in veins, and can be seen during blood donation and when venous blood samples are taken. This is because the spectrum of light absorbed by hemoglobin differs between the oxygenated and deoxygenated states.

Blood in carbon monoxide poisoning is bright red, because carbon monoxide causes the formation of carboxyhemoglobin. In cyanide poisoning, the body cannot use oxygen, so the venous blood remains oxygenated, increasing the redness. There are some conditions affecting the heme groups present in hemoglobin that can make the skin appear blue – a symptom called cyanosis. If the heme is oxidized, methemoglobin, which is more brownish and cannot transport oxygen, is formed. In the rare condition sulfhemoglobinemia, arterial hemoglobin is partially oxygenated, and appears dark red with a bluish hue.

Veins close to the surface of the skin appear blue for a variety of reasons. However, the factors that contribute to this alteration of color perception are related to the light-scattering properties of the skin and the processing of visual input by the visual cortex, rather than the actual color of the venous blood.

Skinks in the genus &quot;Prasinohaema&quot; have green blood due to a buildup of the waste product biliverdin.

==Disorders==
===General medical ===
* Disorders of volume
** Injury can cause blood loss through bleeding. A healthy adult can lose almost 20% of blood volume (1 L) before the first symptom, restlessness, begins, and 40% of volume (2 L) before shock sets in. Thrombocytes are important for blood coagulation and the formation of blood clots, which can stop bleeding. Trauma to the internal organs or bones can cause internal bleeding, which can sometimes be severe.
** Dehydration can reduce the blood volume by reducing the water content of the blood. This would rarely result in shock (apart from the very severe cases) but may result in orthostatic hypotension and fainting.
* Disorders of circulation
** Shock is the ineffective perfusion of tissues, and can be caused by a variety of conditions including blood loss, infection, poor cardiac output.
** Atherosclerosis reduces the flow of blood through arteries, because atheroma lines arteries and narrows them. Atheroma tends to increase with age, and its progression can be compounded by many causes including smoking, high blood pressure, excess circulating lipids (hyperlipidemia), and diabetes mellitus.
** Coagulation can form a thrombosis, which can obstruct vessels.
** Problems with blood composition, the pumping action of the heart, or narrowing of blood vessels can have many consequences including hypoxia (lack of oxygen) of the tissues supplied. The term &quot;ischemia&quot; refers to tissue that is inadequately perfused with blood, and &quot;infarction&quot; refers to tissue death (necrosis), which can occur when the blood supply has been blocked (or is very inadequate).

===Hematological ===

* Anemia
** Insufficient red cell mass (anemia) can be the result of bleeding, blood disorders like thalassemia, or nutritional deficiencies, and may require one or more blood transfusions. Anemia can also be due to a genetic disorder in which the red blood cells do not function effectively. Anemia can be confirmed by a blood test if the hemoglobin value is less than 13.5 gm/dl in men or less than 12.0 gm/dl in women. Several countries have blood banks to fill the demand for transfusable blood. A person receiving a blood transfusion must have a blood type compatible with that of the donor.
** Sickle-cell anemia
* Disorders of cell proliferation
** Leukemia is a group of cancers of the blood-forming tissues and cells.
** Non-cancerous overproduction of red cells (polycythemia vera) or platelets (essential thrombocytosis) may be premalignant.
** Myelodysplastic syndromes involve ineffective production of one or more cell lines.
* Disorders of coagulation
** Hemophilia is a genetic illness that causes dysfunction in one of the blood&#x27;s clotting mechanisms. This can allow otherwise inconsequential wounds to be life-threatening, but more commonly results in hemarthrosis, or bleeding into joint spaces, which can be crippling.
** Ineffective or insufficient platelets can also result in coagulopathy (bleeding disorders).
** Hypercoagulable state (thrombophilia) results from defects in regulation of platelet or clotting factor function, and can cause thrombosis.
* Infectious disorders of blood
** Blood is an important vector of infection. HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is transmitted through contact with blood, semen or other body secretions of an infected person. Hepatitis B and C are transmitted primarily through blood contact. Owing to blood-borne infections, bloodstained objects are treated as a biohazard.
** Bacterial infection of the blood is bacteremia or sepsis. Viral Infection is viremia. Malaria and trypanosomiasis are blood-borne parasitic infections.

===Carbon monoxide poisoning===

Substances other than oxygen can bind to hemoglobin; in some cases, this can cause irreversible damage to the body. Carbon monoxide, for example, is extremely dangerous when carried to the blood via the lungs by inhalation, because carbon monoxide irreversibly binds to hemoglobin to form carboxyhemoglobin, so that less hemoglobin is free to bind oxygen, and fewer oxygen molecules can be transported throughout the blood. This can cause suffocation insidiously. A fire burning in an enclosed room with poor ventilation presents a very dangerous hazard, since it can create a build-up of carbon monoxide in the air. Some carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin when smoking tobacco.

==Treatments==
===Transfusion===
Blood for transfusion is obtained from human donors by blood donation and stored in a blood bank. There are many different blood types in humans, the ABO blood group system, and the Rhesus blood group system being the most important. Transfusion of blood of an incompatible blood group may cause severe, often fatal, complications, so crossmatching is done to ensure that a compatible blood product is transfused.

Other blood products administered intravenously are platelets, blood plasma, cryoprecipitate, and specific coagulation factor concentrates.

===Intravenous administration===
Many forms of medication (from antibiotics to chemotherapy) are administered intravenously, as they are not readily or adequately absorbed by the digestive tract.

After severe acute blood loss, liquid preparations, generically known as plasma expanders, can be given intravenously, either solutions of salts (NaCl, KCl, CaCl2 etc.) at physiological concentrations, or colloidal solutions, such as dextrans, human serum albumin, or fresh frozen plasma. In these emergency situations, a plasma expander is a more effective life-saving procedure than a blood transfusion, because the metabolism of transfused red blood cells does not restart immediately after a transfusion.

===Letting===

In modern evidence-based medicine, bloodletting is used in management of a few rare diseases, including hemochromatosis and polycythemia. However, bloodletting and leeching were common unvalidated interventions used until the 19th century, as many diseases were incorrectly thought to be due to an excess of blood, according to Hippocratic medicine.

==Etymology==

English &quot;blood&quot; (Old English &quot;blod&quot;) derives from Germanic and has cognates with a similar range of meanings in all other Germanic languages (e.g. German &quot;Blut&quot;, Swedish &quot;blod&quot;, Gothic &quot;blōþ&quot;). There is no accepted Indo-European etymology.

==History==
===Classical Greek medicine===
Robin Fåhræus (a Swedish physician who devised the erythrocyte sedimentation rate) suggested that the Ancient Greek system of humorism, wherein the body was thought to contain four distinct bodily fluids (associated with different temperaments), were based upon the observation of blood clotting in a transparent container. When blood is drawn in a glass container and left undisturbed for about an hour, four different layers can be seen. A dark clot forms at the bottom (the &quot;black bile&quot;). Above the clot is a layer of red blood cells (the &quot;blood&quot;). Above this is a whitish layer of white blood cells (the &quot;phlegm&quot;). The top layer is clear yellow serum (the &quot;yellow bile&quot;).

In general, Greek thinkers believed that blood was made from food. Plato and Aristotle are two important sources of evidence for this view, but it dates back to Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;. Plato thinks that fire in our bellies transform food into blood. Plato believes that the movements of air in the body as we exhale and inhale carry the fire as it transforms our food into blood. Aristotle believed that food is concocted into blood in the heart and transformed into our body&#x27;s matter.

===Types===
The ABO blood group system was discovered in the year 1900 by Karl Landsteiner. Jan Janský is credited with the first classification of blood into the four types (A, B, AB, and O) in 1907, which remains in use today. In 1907 the first blood transfusion was performed that used the ABO system to predict compatibility. The first non-direct transfusion was performed on 27 March 1914. The Rhesus factor was discovered in 1937.

==Culture and religion==

Due to its importance to life, blood is associated with a large number of beliefs. One of the most basic is the use of blood as a symbol for family relationships through birth/parentage; to be &quot;related by blood&quot; is to be related by ancestry or descendence, rather than marriage. This bears closely to bloodlines, and sayings such as &quot;blood is thicker than water&quot; and &quot;&quot;, as well as &quot;Blood brother&quot;.

Blood is given particular emphasis in the Islamic, Jewish, and Christian religions, because Leviticus 17:11 says &quot;the life of a creature is in the blood.&quot; This phrase is part of the Levitical law forbidding the drinking of blood or eating meat with the blood still intact instead of being poured off.

Mythic references to blood can sometimes be connected to the life-giving nature of blood, seen in such events as childbirth, as contrasted with the blood of injury or death.

===Indigenous Australians===
In many indigenous Australian Aboriginal peoples&#x27; traditions, ochre (particularly red) and blood, both high in iron content and considered Maban, are applied to the bodies of dancers for ritual. As Lawlor states: Lawlor comments that blood employed in this fashion is held by these peoples to attune the dancers to the invisible energetic realm of the Dreamtime. Lawlor then connects these invisible energetic realms and magnetic fields, because iron is magnetic.

===European paganism===
Among the Germanic tribes, blood was used during their sacrifices; the &quot;Blóts&quot;. The blood was considered to have the power of its originator, and, after the butchering, the blood was sprinkled on the walls, on the statues of the gods, and on the participants themselves. This act of sprinkling blood was called &quot;blóedsian&quot; in Old English, and the terminology was borrowed by the Roman Catholic Church becoming &quot;to bless&quot; and &quot;blessing&quot;. The Hittite word for blood, &quot;ishar&quot; was a cognate to words for &quot;oath&quot; and &quot;bond&quot;, see Ishara.
The Ancient Greeks believed that the blood of the gods, &quot;ichor&quot;, was a substance that was poisonous to mortals.

As a relic of Germanic Law, the cruentation, an ordeal where the corpse of the victim was supposed to start bleeding in the presence of the murderer, was used until the early 17th century.

===Christianity===
In Genesis 9:4, God prohibited Noah and his sons from eating blood (see Noahide Law). This command continued to be observed by the Eastern Orthodox Church.

It is also found in the Bible that when the Angel of Death came around to the Hebrew house that the first-born child would not die if the angel saw lamb&#x27;s blood wiped across the doorway.

At the Council of Jerusalem, the apostles prohibited certain Christians from consuming blood – this is documented in Acts 15:20 and 29. This chapter specifies a reason (especially in verses 19–21): It was to avoid offending Jews who had become Christians, because the Mosaic Law Code prohibited the practice.

Christ&#x27;s blood is the means for the atonement of sins. Also, &quot;... the blood of Jesus Christ his [God] Son cleanseth us from all sin.&quot; (1 John 1:7), &quot;... Unto him [God] that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood.&quot; (Revelation 1:5), and &quot;And they overcame him (Satan) by the blood of the Lamb [Jesus the Christ], and by the word of their testimony ...&quot; (Revelation 12:11).

Some Christian churches, including Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodoxy, and the Assyrian Church of the East teach that, when consecrated, the Eucharistic wine actually becomes the blood of Jesus for worshippers to drink. Thus in the consecrated wine, Jesus becomes spiritually and physically present. This teaching is rooted in the Last Supper, as written in the four gospels of the Bible, in which Jesus stated to his disciples that the bread that they ate was his body, and the wine was his blood. &quot;&quot;This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.&quot; ()&quot;.

Most forms of Protestantism, especially those of a Methodist or Presbyterian lineage, teach that the wine is no more than a symbol of the blood of Christ, who is spiritually but not physically present. Lutheran theology teaches that the body and blood is present together &quot;in, with, and under&quot; the bread and wine of the Eucharistic feast.

===Judaism===
In Judaism, animal blood may not be consumed even in the smallest quantity (Leviticus 3:17 and elsewhere); this is reflected in Jewish dietary laws (Kashrut). Blood is purged from meat by rinsing and soaking in water (to loosen clots), salting and then rinsing with water again several times. Eggs must also be checked and any blood spots removed before consumption. Although blood from fish is biblically kosher, it is rabbinically forbidden to consume fish blood to avoid the appearance of breaking the Biblical prohibition.

Another ritual involving blood involves the covering of the blood of fowl and game after slaughtering (Leviticus 17:13); the reason given by the Torah is: &quot;Because the life of the animal is [in] its blood&quot; (ibid 17:14). In relation to human beings, Kabbalah expounds on this verse that the animal soul of a person is in the blood, and that physical desires stem from it.

Likewise, the mystical reason for salting temple sacrifices and slaughtered meat is to remove the blood of animal-like passions from the person. By removing the animal&#x27;s blood, the animal energies and life-force contained in the blood are removed, making the meat fit for human consumption.

===Islam===
Consumption of food containing blood is forbidden by Islamic dietary laws. This is derived from the statement in the Qur&#x27;an, sura Al-Ma&#x27;ida (5:3): &quot;Forbidden to you (for food) are: dead meat, blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which has been invoked the name of other than Allah.&quot;

Blood is considered unclean, hence there are specific methods to obtain physical and ritual status of cleanliness once bleeding has occurred. Specific rules and prohibitions apply to menstruation, postnatal bleeding and irregular vaginal bleeding. When an animal has been slaughtered, the animal&#x27;s neck is cut in a way to ensure that the spine is not severed, hence the brain may send commands to the heart to pump blood to it for oxygen. In this way, blood is removed from the body, and the meat is generally now safe to cook and eat. In modern times, blood transfusions are generally not considered against the rules.

===Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses===
Based on their interpretation of scriptures such as Acts 15:28, 29 (&quot;Keep abstaining...from blood.&quot;), many Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses neither consume blood nor accept transfusions of whole blood or its major components: red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets (thrombocytes), and plasma. Members may personally decide whether they will accept medical procedures that involve their own blood or substances that are further fractionated from the four major components.

===Vampirism===

Vampires are mythical creatures that drink blood directly for sustenance, usually with a preference for human blood. Cultures all over the world have myths of this kind; for example the &#x27;Nosferatu&#x27; legend, a human who achieves damnation and immortality by drinking the blood of others, originates from Eastern European folklore. Ticks, leeches, female mosquitoes, vampire bats, and an assortment of other natural creatures do consume the blood of other animals, but only bats are associated with vampires. This has no relation to vampire bats, which are New World creatures discovered well after the origins of the European myths.

==Invertebrates==

In invertebrates, a body fluid analogous to blood called hemolymph is found, the main difference being that hemolymph is not contained in a closed circulatory system. Hemolymph may function to carry oxygen, although hemoglobin is not necessarily used. Crustaceans and mollusks use hemocyanin instead of hemoglobin. In most insects, their hemolymph does not contain oxygen-carrying molecules because their bodies are small enough for their tracheal system to suffice for supplying oxygen.

==Other uses==
===Forensic and archaeological===
Blood residue can help forensic investigators identify weapons, reconstruct a criminal action, and link suspects to the crime. Through bloodstain pattern analysis, forensic information can also be gained from the spatial distribution of bloodstains.

Blood residue analysis is also a technique used in archeology.

===Artistic===
Blood is one of the body fluids that has been used in art. In particular, the performances of Viennese Actionist Hermann Nitsch, Istvan Kantor, Franko B, Lennie Lee, Ron Athey, Yang Zhichao, Lucas Abela and Kira O&#x27;Reilly, along with the photography of Andres Serrano, have incorporated blood as a prominent visual element. Marc Quinn has made sculptures using frozen blood, including a cast of his own head made using his own blood.

===Genealogical===
The term &quot;blood&quot; is used in genealogical circles to refer to one&#x27;s ancestry, origins, and ethnic background as in the word &quot;bloodline&quot;. Other terms where blood is used in a family history sense are &quot;blue-blood&quot;, &quot;royal blood&quot;, &quot;mixed-blood&quot; and &quot;blood relative&quot;.

<text>Benoit B. Mandelbrot (20 November 1924 – 14 October 2010) was a Polish-born French-American mathematician and polymath with broad interests in the practical sciences, especially regarding what he labeled as &quot;the art of roughness&quot; of physical phenomena and &quot;the uncontrolled element in life&quot;. He referred to himself as a &quot;fractalist&quot; and is recognized for his contribution to the field of fractal geometry, which included coining the word &quot;fractal&quot;, as well as developing a theory of &quot;roughness and self-similarity&quot; in nature.

In 1936, at the age of 11, Mandelbrot and his family emigrated from Warsaw, Poland, to France. After World War II ended, Mandelbrot studied mathematics, graduating from universities in Paris and in the United States and receiving a master&#x27;s degree in aeronautics from the California Institute of Technology. He spent most of his career in both the United States and France, having dual French and American citizenship. In 1958, he began a 35-year career at IBM, where he became an IBM Fellow, and periodically took leaves of absence to teach at Harvard University. At Harvard, following the publication of his study of U.S. commodity markets in relation to cotton futures, he taught economics and applied sciences.

Because of his access to IBM&#x27;s computers, Mandelbrot was one of the first to use computer graphics to create and display fractal geometric images, leading to his discovery of the Mandelbrot set in 1980. He showed how visual complexity can be created from simple rules. He said that things typically considered to be &quot;rough&quot;, a &quot;mess&quot;, or &quot;chaotic&quot;, such as clouds or shorelines, actually had a &quot;degree of order&quot;. His math- and geometry-centered research included contributions to such fields as statistical physics, meteorology, hydrology, geomorphology, anatomy, taxonomy, neurology, linguistics, information technology, computer graphics, economics, geology, medicine, physical cosmology, engineering, chaos theory, econophysics, metallurgy, and the social sciences.

Toward the end of his career, he was Sterling Professor of Mathematical Sciences at Yale University, where he was the oldest professor in Yale&#x27;s history to receive tenure.
Mandelbrot also held positions at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Université Lille Nord de France, Institute for Advanced Study and Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique. During his career, he received over 15 honorary doctorates and served on many science journals, along with winning numerous awards. His autobiography, &quot;The Fractalist: Memoir of a Scientific Maverick&quot;, was published posthumously in 2012.

== Early years ==

Benedykt Mandelbrot was born in a Lithuanian Jewish family, in Warsaw during the Second Polish Republic. His father made his living trading clothing; his mother was a dental surgeon. During his first two school years, he was tutored privately by an uncle who despised rote learning: &quot;Most of my time was spent playing chess, reading maps and learning how to open my eyes to everything around me.&quot; 

In 1936, when he was 11, the family emigrated from Poland to France. The move, World War II, and the influence of his father&#x27;s brother, the mathematician Szolem Mandelbrojt (who had moved to Paris around 1920), further prevented a standard education. &quot;The fact that my parents, as economic and political refugees, joined Szolem in France saved our lives,&quot; he writes.

Mandelbrot attended the Lycée Rollin (now the Collège-lycée Jacques-Decour) in Paris until the start of World War II, when his family moved to Tulle, France. He was helped by Rabbi David Feuerwerker, the Rabbi of Brive-la-Gaillarde, to continue his studies. Much of France was occupied by the Nazis at the time, and Mandelbrot recalls this period:
In 1944, Mandelbrot returned to Paris, studied at the Lycée du Parc in Lyon, and in 1945 to 1947 attended the École Polytechnique, where he studied under Gaston Julia and Paul Lévy. From 1947 to 1949 he studied at California Institute of Technology, where he earned a master&#x27;s degree in aeronautics. Returning to France, he obtained his PhD degree in Mathematical Sciences at the University of Paris in 1952.

==Research career==
From 1949 to 1958, Mandelbrot was a staff member at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique. During this time he spent a year at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where he was sponsored by John von Neumann. In 1955 he married Aliette Kagan and moved to Geneva, Switzerland (to collaborate with Jean Piaget at the International Centre for Genetic Epistemology) and later to the Université Lille Nord de France. In 1958 the couple moved to the United States where Mandelbrot joined the research staff at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York. He remained at IBM for 35 years, becoming an IBM Fellow, and later Fellow Emeritus.
From 1951 onward, Mandelbrot worked on problems and published papers not only in mathematics but in applied fields such as information theory, economics, and fluid dynamics.

===Randomness and fractals in financial markets===

Mandelbrot saw financial markets as an example of &quot;wild randomness&quot;, characterized by concentration and long-range dependence. He developed several original approaches for modelling financial fluctuations. In his early work, he found that the price changes in financial markets did not follow a Gaussian distribution, but rather Lévy stable distributions having infinite variance. He found, for example, that cotton prices followed a Lévy stable distribution with parameter &quot;α&quot; equal to 1.7 rather than 2 as in a Gaussian distribution. &quot;Stable&quot; distributions have the property that the sum of many instances of a random variable follows the same distribution but with a larger scale parameter. The latter work from the early 60s was done with daily data of cotton prices from 1900, long before he introduced the word &#x27;fractal&#x27;. In later years, after the concept of fractals had matured, the study of financial markets in the context of fractals became possible only after the availability of high frequency data in finance. 

In the late 1980s, Mandelbrot used intra-daily tick data supplied by Olsen &amp; Associates in Zurich to apply fractal theory to market microstructure. This cooperation led to the publication of the first comprehensive papers on scaling law in finance. This law shows similar properties at different time scales, confirming Mandelbrot&#x27;s insight of the fractal nature of market microstructure. Mandelbrot&#x27;s own research in this area is presented in his books &quot;Fractals and Scaling in Finance&quot; and &quot;The (Mis)behavior of Markets&quot;.

===Developing &quot;fractal geometry&quot; and the Mandelbrot set===
As a visiting professor at Harvard University, Mandelbrot began to study mathematical objects called Julia sets that were invariant under certain transformations of the complex plane. Building on previous work by Gaston Julia and Pierre Fatou, Mandelbrot used a computer to plot images of the Julia sets. While investigating the topology of these Julia sets, he studied the Mandelbrot set which was introduced by him in 1979.

In 1975, Mandelbrot coined the term &quot;fractal&quot; to describe these structures and first published his ideas in the French book &quot;Les Objets Fractals: Forme, Hasard et Dimension&quot;, later translated in 1977 as &quot;Fractals: Form, Chance and Dimension&quot;. According to computer scientist and physicist Stephen Wolfram, the book was a &quot;breakthrough&quot; for Mandelbrot, who until then would typically &quot;apply fairly straightforward mathematics ... to areas that had barely seen the light of serious mathematics before&quot;. Wolfram adds that as a result of this new research, he was no longer a &quot;wandering scientist&quot;, and later called him &quot;the father of fractals&quot;:

Wolfram briefly describes fractals as a form of geometric repetition, &quot;in which smaller and smaller copies of a pattern are successively nested inside each other, so that the same intricate shapes appear no matter how much you zoom in to the whole. Fern leaves and Romanesque broccoli are two examples from nature.&quot; He points out an unexpected conclusion:

Mandelbrot used the term &quot;fractal&quot; as it derived from the Latin word &quot;fractus&quot;, defined as broken or shattered glass. Using the newly developed IBM computers at his disposal, Mandelbrot was able to create fractal images using graphics computer code, images that an interviewer described as looking like &quot;the delirious exuberance of the 1960s psychedelic art with forms hauntingly reminiscent of nature and the human body&quot;. He also saw himself as a &quot;would-be Kepler&quot;, after the 17th-century scientist Johannes Kepler, who calculated and described the orbits of the planets.

Mandelbrot, however, never felt he was inventing a new idea. He described his feelings in a documentary with science writer Arthur C. Clarke:

According to Clarke, &quot;the Mandelbrot set is indeed one of the most astonishing discoveries in the entire history of mathematics. Who could have dreamed that such an incredibly simple equation could have generated images of literally &quot;infinite&quot; complexity?&quot; Clarke also notes an &quot;odd coincidence&quot;:

the name Mandelbrot, and the word &quot;mandala&quot;—for a religious symbol—which I&#x27;m sure is a pure coincidence, but indeed the Mandelbrot set does seem to contain an enormous number of mandalas.

In 1982, Mandelbrot expanded and updated his ideas in &quot;The Fractal Geometry of Nature&quot;. This influential work brought fractals into the mainstream of professional and popular mathematics, as well as silencing critics, who had dismissed fractals as &quot;program artifacts&quot;.

Mandelbrot left IBM in 1987, after 35 years and 12 days, when IBM decided to end pure research in his division. He joined the Department of Mathematics at Yale, and obtained his first tenured post in 1999, at the age of 75. At the time of his retirement in 2005, he was Sterling Professor of Mathematical Sciences.

===Fractals and the &quot;theory of roughness&quot;===
Mandelbrot created the first-ever &quot;theory of roughness&quot;, and he saw &quot;roughness&quot; in the shapes of mountains, coastlines and river basins; the structures of plants, blood vessels and lungs; the clustering of galaxies. His personal quest was to create some mathematical formula to measure the overall &quot;roughness&quot; of such objects in nature. He began by asking himself various kinds of questions related to nature:
In his paper &quot;How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension&quot;, published in &quot;Science&quot; in 1967, Mandelbrot discusses self-similar curves that have Hausdorff dimension that are examples of &quot;fractals&quot;, although Mandelbrot does not use this term in the paper, as he did not coin it until 1975. The paper is one of Mandelbrot&#x27;s first publications on the topic of fractals.

Mandelbrot emphasized the use of fractals as realistic and useful models for describing many &quot;rough&quot; phenomena in the real world. He concluded that &quot;real roughness is often fractal and can be measured.&quot; Although Mandelbrot coined the term &quot;fractal&quot;, some of the mathematical objects he presented in &quot;The Fractal Geometry of Nature&quot; had been previously described by other mathematicians. Before Mandelbrot, however, they were regarded as isolated curiosities with unnatural and non-intuitive properties. Mandelbrot brought these objects together for the first time and turned them into essential tools for the long-stalled effort to extend the scope of science to explaining non-smooth, &quot;rough&quot; objects in the real world. His methods of research were both old and new:
Fractals are also found in human pursuits, such as music, painting, architecture, and in the financial field. Mandelbrot believed that fractals, far from being unnatural, were in many ways more intuitive and natural than the artificially smooth objects of traditional Euclidean geometry: Clouds are not spheres, mountains are not cones, coastlines are not circles, and bark is not smooth, nor does lightning travel in a straight line.  —Mandelbrot, in his introduction to &quot;The Fractal Geometry of Nature&quot;
Mandelbrot has been called an artist, and a visionary and a maverick. His informal and passionate style of writing and his emphasis on visual and geometric intuition (supported by the inclusion of numerous illustrations) made &quot;The Fractal Geometry of Nature&quot; accessible to non-specialists. The book sparked widespread popular interest in fractals and contributed to chaos theory and other fields of science and mathematics.

Mandelbrot also put his ideas to work in cosmology. He offered in 1974 a new explanation of Olbers&#x27; paradox (the &quot;dark night sky&quot; riddle), demonstrating the consequences of fractal theory as a sufficient, but not necessary, resolution of the paradox. He postulated that if the stars in the universe were fractally distributed (for example, like Cantor dust), it would not be necessary to rely on the Big Bang theory to explain the paradox. His model would not rule out a Big Bang, but would allow for a dark sky even if the Big Bang had not occurred.

==Awards and honors==
Mandelbrot&#x27;s awards include the Wolf Prize in Physics in 1993, the Lewis Fry Richardson Prize of the European Geophysical Society in 2000, the Japan Prize in 2003, and the Einstein Lectureship of the American Mathematical Society in 2006.

The small asteroid 27500 Mandelbrot was named in his honor. In November 1990, he was made a Chevalier in France&#x27;s Legion of Honour. In December 2005, Mandelbrot was appointed to the position of Battelle Fellow at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. Mandelbrot was promoted to an Officer of the Legion of Honour in January 2006. An honorary degree from Johns Hopkins University was bestowed on Mandelbrot in the May 2010 commencement exercises.

== Death and legacy ==
Mandelbrot died from pancreatic cancer at the age of 85 in a hospice in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on 14 October 2010. Reacting to news of his death, mathematician Heinz-Otto Peitgen said: &quot;[I]f we talk about impact inside mathematics, and applications in the sciences, he is one of the most important figures of the last fifty years.&quot;

Chris Anderson, TED conference curator, described Mandelbrot as &quot;an icon who changed how we see the world&quot;. Nicolas Sarkozy, President of France at the time of Mandelbrot&#x27;s death, said Mandelbrot had &quot;a powerful, original mind that never shied away from innovating and shattering preconceived notions [... h]is work, developed entirely outside mainstream research, led to modern information theory.&quot; Mandelbrot&#x27;s obituary in &quot;The Economist&quot; points out his fame as &quot;celebrity beyond the academy&quot; and lauds him as the &quot;father of fractal geometry&quot;.

Best-selling essayist-author Nassim Nicholas Taleb has remarked that Mandelbrot&#x27;s book &quot;The (Mis)Behavior of Markets&quot; is in his opinion &quot;The deepest and most realistic finance book ever published&quot;.

<text>Benedict of Nursia (; ; 2 March 480 – 21 March 547), often known as Saint Benedict, was an Italian Catholic monk. He is famed in the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Lutheran Churches, the Anglican Communion, and Old Catholic Churches. In 1964, Pope Paul VI declared Benedict a patron saint of Europe.

Benedict founded twelve communities for monks at Subiaco in present-day Lazio, Italy (about to the east of Rome), before moving southeast to Monte Cassino in the mountains of central Italy. The present-day Order of Saint Benedict emerged later and, moreover, is not an &quot;order&quot; as the term is commonly understood, but a confederation of autonomous congregations.

Benedict&#x27;s main achievement, his &quot;Rule of Saint Benedict&quot;, contains a set of rules for his monks to follow. Heavily influenced by the writings of John Cassian ( – ), it shows strong affinity with the earlier &quot;Rule of the Master&quot;, but it also has a unique spirit of balance, moderation and reasonableness (, &quot;epieíkeia&quot;), which persuaded most Christian religious communities founded throughout the Middle Ages to adopt it. As a result, Benedict&#x27;s Rule became one of the most influential religious rules in Western Christendom. For this reason, Giuseppe Carletti regarded Benedict as the founder of Western Christian monasticism.

==Biography==
Apart from a short poem attributed to Mark of Monte Cassino, the only ancient account of Benedict is found in the second volume of Pope Gregory I&#x27;s four-book &quot;Dialogues&quot;, thought to have been written in 593, although the authenticity of this work is disputed.

Gregory&#x27;s account of Benedict&#x27;s life, however, is not a biography in the modern sense of the word. It provides instead a spiritual portrait of the gentle, disciplined abbot. In a letter to Bishop Maximilian of Syracuse, Gregory states his intention for his &quot;Dialogues&quot;, saying they are a kind of &quot;floretum&quot; (an &quot;anthology&quot;, literally, &#x27;flower garden&#x27;) of the most striking miracles of Italian holy men.

Gregory did not set out to write a chronological, historically anchored story of Benedict, but he did base his anecdotes on direct testimony. To establish his authority, Gregory explains that his information came from what he considered the best sources: a handful of Benedict&#x27;s disciples who lived with him and witnessed his various miracles. These followers, he says, are Constantinus, who succeeded Benedict as Abbot of Monte Cassino, Honoratus, who was abbot of Subiaco when St. Gregory wrote his &quot;Dialogues&quot;, Valentinianus, and Simplicius.

In Gregory&#x27;s day, history was not recognised as an independent field of study; it was a branch of grammar or rhetoric, and &quot;historia&quot; was an account that summed up the findings of the learned when they wrote what was, at that time, considered history. Gregory&#x27;s &quot;Dialogues&quot;, Book Two, then, an authentic medieval hagiography cast as a conversation between the Pope and his deacon Peter, is designed to teach spiritual lessons.

==Early life==
Benedict was the son of a Roman noble of Nursia, the modern Norcia, in Umbria. If 480 is accepted as the year of his birth, the year of his abandonment of his studies and leaving home would be about 500. Gregory&#x27;s narrative makes it impossible to suppose him younger than 20 at the time.

Benedict was sent to Rome to study, but was disappointed by the academic studies he encountered there. Seeking to flee the great city, he left with his nurse and settled in Enfide. Enfide, which the tradition of Subiaco identifies with the modern Affile, is in the Simbruini mountains, about forty miles from Rome and two miles from Subiaco.

A short distance from Enfide is the entrance to a narrow, gloomy valley, penetrating the mountains and leading directly to Subiaco. The path continues to ascend, and the side of the ravine on which it runs becomes steeper until a cave is reached, above this point the mountain now rises almost perpendicularly; while on the right, it strikes in a rapid descent down to where, in Benedict&#x27;s day, below, lay the blue waters of a lake. The cave has a large triangular-shaped opening and is about ten feet deep.
On his way from Enfide, Benedict met a monk, Romanus of Subiaco, whose monastery was on the mountain above the cliff overhanging the cave. Romanus discussed with Benedict the purpose which had brought him to Subiaco, and gave him the monk&#x27;s habit. By his advice Benedict became a hermit and for three years lived in this cave above the lake.

==Later life==
Gregory tells little of Benedict&#x27;s later life. He now speaks of Benedict no longer as a youth (), but as a man () of God. Romanus, Gregory states, served Benedict in every way he could. The monk apparently visited him frequently, and on fixed days brought him food.

During these three years of solitude, broken only by occasional communications with the outer world and by the visits of Romanus, Benedict matured both in mind and character, in knowledge of himself and of his fellow-man, and at the same time he became not merely known to, but secured the respect of, those about him; so much so that on the death of the abbot of a monastery in the neighbourhood (identified by some with Vicovaro), the community came to him and begged him to become its abbot. Benedict was acquainted with the life and discipline of the monastery, and knew that &quot;their manners were diverse from his and therefore that they would never agree together: yet, at length, overcome with their entreaty, he gave his consent&quot;. The experiment failed; the monks tried to poison him. The legend goes that they first tried to poison his drink. He prayed a blessing over the cup and the cup shattered. Thus he left the group and went back to his cave at Subiaco. 

There lived in the neighborhood a priest called Florentius who, moved by envy, tried to ruin him. He tried to poison him with poisoned bread. When he prayed a blessing over the bread, a raven swept in and took the loaf away. From this time his miracles seem to have become frequent, and many people, attracted by his sanctity and character, came to Subiaco to be under his guidance. Having failed by sending him poisonous bread, Florentius tried to seduce his monks with some prostitutes. To avoid further temptations, in about 530 Benedict left Subiaco. He founded 12 monasteries in the vicinity of Subiaco, and, eventually, in 530 he founded the great Benedictine monastery of Monte Cassino, which lies on a hilltop between Rome and Naples.

==Veneration==
Benedict died of a fever at Monte Cassino not long after his sister, Scholastica, and was buried in the same tomb. According to tradition, this occurred on 21 March 547. He was named patron protector of Europe by Pope Paul VI in 1964. In 1980, Pope John Paul II declared him co-patron of Europe, together with Cyril and Methodius. Furthermore, he is the patron saint of speleologists. On the island of Tenerife (Spain) he is the patron saint of fields and farmers. An important romeria (&quot;Romería Regional de San Benito Abad&quot;) is held on this island in his honor, one of the most important in the country.

In the pre-1970 General Roman Calendar, his feast is kept on 21 March, the day of his death according to some manuscripts of the &quot;Martyrologium Hieronymianum&quot; and that of Bede. Because on that date his liturgical memorial would always be impeded by the observance of Lent, the 1969 revision of the General Roman Calendar moved his memorial to 11 July, the date that appears in some Gallic liturgical books of the end of the 8th century as the feast commemorating his birth (&quot;Natalis S. Benedicti&quot;). There is some uncertainty about the origin of this feast. Accordingly, on 21 March the Roman Martyrology mentions in a line and a half that it is Benedict&#x27;s day of death and that his memorial is celebrated on 11 July, while on 11 July it devotes seven lines to speaking of him, and mentions the tradition that he died on 21 March.

The Eastern Orthodox Church commemorates Saint Benedict on 14 March.

The Lutheran Churches celebrate the Feast of Saint Benedict on July 11.

The Anglican Communion has no single universal calendar, but a provincial calendar of saints is published in each province. In almost all of these, Saint Benedict is commemorated on 11 July. Benedict is remembered in the Church of England with a Lesser Festival on 11 July.

==&quot;Rule of Saint Benedict&quot;==

Benedict wrote the &quot;Rule&quot; for monks living communally under the authority of an abbot. The &quot;Rule&quot; comprises seventy-three short chapters. Its wisdom is twofold: spiritual (how to live a Christocentric life on earth) and administrative (how to run a monastery efficiently). More than half of the chapters describe how to be obedient and humble, and what to do when a member of the community is not. About one-fourth regulate the work of God (the &quot;opus Dei&quot;). One-tenth outline how, and by whom, the monastery should be managed. Benedictine asceticism is known for its moderation.

==Saint Benedict Medal==
This devotional medal originally came from a cross in honor of Saint Benedict. On one side, the medal has an image of Saint Benedict, holding the Holy Rule in his left hand and a cross in his right. There is a raven on one side of him, with a cup on the other side of him. Around the medal&#x27;s outer margin are the words &quot;Eius in obitu nostro praesentia muniamur&quot; (&quot;May we be strengthened by his presence in the hour of our death&quot;). The other side of the medal has a cross with the initials CSSML on the vertical bar which signify &quot;Crux Sacra Sit Mihi Lux&quot; (&quot;May the Holy Cross be my light&quot;) and on the horizontal bar are the initials NDSMD which stand for &quot;Non-Draco Sit Mihi Dux&quot; (&quot;Let not the dragon be my guide&quot;). The initials CSPB stand for &quot;Crux Sancti Patris Benedicti&quot; (&quot;The Cross of the Holy Father Benedict&quot;) and are located on the interior angles of the cross. Either the inscription &quot;PAX&quot; (Peace) or the Christogram &quot;IHS&quot; may be found at the top of the cross in most cases. Around the medal&#x27;s margin on this side are the &quot;Vade Retro Satana&quot; initials VRSNSMV which stand for &quot;Vade Retro Satana, Nonquam Suade Mihi Vana&quot; (&quot;Begone Satan, do not suggest to me thy vanities&quot;) then a space followed by the initials SMQLIVB which signify &quot;Sunt Mala Quae Libas, Ipse Venena Bibas&quot; (&quot;Evil are the things thou profferest, drink thou thine own poison&quot;).
This medal was first struck in 1880 to commemorate the fourteenth centenary of Benedict&#x27;s birth and is also called the Jubilee Medal; its exact origin, however, is unknown. In 1647, during a witchcraft trial at Natternberg near Metten Abbey in Bavaria, the accused women testified they had no power over Metten, which was under the protection of the cross. An investigation found a number of painted crosses on the walls of the abbey with the letters now found on St Benedict medals, but their meaning had been forgotten. A manuscript written in 1415 was eventually found that had a picture of Benedict holding a scroll in one hand and a staff which ended in a cross in the other. On the scroll and staff were written the full words of the initials contained on the crosses. Medals then began to be struck in Germany, which then spread throughout Europe. This medal was first approved by Pope Benedict XIV in his briefs of 23 December 1741 and 12 March 1742.

Benedict has been also the motif of many collector&#x27;s coins around the world. The Austria 50 euro &#x27;The Christian Religious Orders&#x27;, issued on 13 March 2002 is one of them.

==Influence==
The early Middle Ages have been called &quot;the Benedictine centuries&quot;. In April 2008, Pope Benedict XVI discussed the influence St Benedict had on Western Europe. The pope said that &quot;with his life and work St Benedict exercised a fundamental influence on the development of European civilization and culture&quot; and helped Europe to emerge from the &quot;dark night of history&quot; that followed the fall of the Roman Empire.

Benedict contributed more than anyone else to the rise of monasticism in the West. His Rule was the foundational document for thousands of religious communities in the Middle Ages. To this day, The Rule of St. Benedict is the most common and influential Rule used by monasteries and monks, more than 1,400 years after its writing.

A basilica was built upon the birthplace of Benedict and Scholastica in the 1400s. Ruins of their familial home were excavated from beneath the church and preserved. The earthquake of 30 October 2016 completely devastated the structure of the basilica, leaving only the front facade and altar standing.

<text>The Battle of Pharsalus was the decisive battle of Caesar&#x27;s Civil War fought on 9 August 48 BC near Pharsalus in Central Greece. Julius Caesar and his allies formed up opposite the army of the Roman Republic under the command of Pompey. Pompey had the backing of a majority of Roman senators and his army significantly outnumbered the veteran Caesarian legions.

Pressured by his officers, Pompey reluctantly engaged in battle and suffered an overwhelming defeat, ultimately fleeing the camp and his men, disguised as an ordinary citizen. Eventually making his way to Egypt, he was assassinated upon his arrival at the order of Ptolemy XIII.

==Prelude==
Following the start of the Civil War, Caesar had captured Rome, forced Pompey and his allies to withdraw from Italy, and defeated Pompey&#x27;s legates in Spain. In the campaign season for 48 BC, Caesar crossed the Adriatic and advanced on Dyrrachium. There, he besieged it, but was defeated.

Caesar then withdrew east into Thessaly, partly to relieve one of his legates from attack by Metellus Scipio&#x27;s forces arriving from Syria. He besieged Gomphi after it resisted him. Pompey pursued, seeking to spare Italy from invasion by concluding the war on Greek soil, to prevent Caesar from defeating Metellus Scipio&#x27;s forces arriving from Syria, and under pressure from his overconfident allies who accused him of prolonging the war to extend his command.

==Date==
The decisive battle took place on 9 August 48 BC according to the Republican calendar.

==Location==
The location of the battlefield was for a long time the subject of controversy among scholars. Caesar himself, in his &quot;Commentarii de Bello Civili&quot;, mentions few place-names; and although the battle is called after Pharsalos by modern authors, four ancient writers – the author of the &quot;Bellum Alexandrinum&quot; (48.1), Frontinus (&quot;Strategemata&quot; 2.3.22), Eutropius (20), and Orosius (6.15.27) – place it specifically at &quot;Palae&quot;pharsalus (&quot;Old&quot; Pharsalus). Strabo in his &quot;Geographica&quot; (&quot;Γεωγραφικά&quot;) mentions both old and new Pharsaloi, and notes that the Thetideion, the temple to Thetis south of Scotoussa, was near both. In 198 BC, in the Second Macedonian War, Philip V of Macedon sacked Palaepharsalos (Livy, &quot;Ab Urbe Condita&quot; 32.13.9), but left new Pharsalos untouched. These two details perhaps imply that the two cities were not close neighbours. Many scholars, therefore, unsure of the site of Palaepharsalos, followed Appian (2.75) and located the battle of 48 BC south of the Enipeus or close to Pharsalos (today&#x27;s Pharsala). Among the scholars arguing for the south side are Béquignon (1928), Bruère (1951), and Gwatkin (1957).

An increasing number of scholars, however, have argued for a location on the north side of the river. These include Perrin (1885), Holmes (1908), Lucas (1921), Rambaud (1955), Pelling (1973), Morgan (1983), and Sheppard (2006). John D. Morgan in his definitive &quot;Palae-pharsalus – the Battle and the Town&quot;, shows that Palaepharsalus cannot have been at Palaiokastro, as Béquignon thought (a site abandoned c. 500 BC), nor the hill of Fatih-Dzami within the walls of Pharsalus itself, as Kromayer (1903, 1931) and Gwatkin thought; and Morgan argues that it is probably also not the hill of Khtouri (Koutouri), some 7 miles north-west of Pharsalus on the south bank of the Enipeus, as Lucas and Holmes thought, although that remains a possibility. However, Morgan believes it is most likely to have been the hill just east of the village of (Krini Larisas, formerly Driskoli) very close to the ancient highway from Larisa to Pharsalus. This site is some north of Pharsalus, and three miles north of the river Enipeus, and not only has remains dating back to neolithic times but also signs of habitation in the 1st century BC and later. The identification seems to be confirmed by the location of a place misspelled &quot;Palfari&quot; or &quot;Falaphari&quot; shown on a medieval route map of the road just north of Pharsalus. Morgan places Pompey&#x27;s camp a mile to the west of Krini, just north of the village of Avra (formerly Sarikayia), and Caesar&#x27;s camp some four miles to the east-south-east of Pompey&#x27;s. According to this reconstruction, therefore, the battle took place not between Pharsalus and the river, as Appian wrote, but between Old Pharsalus and the river.

An interesting side-note on Palaepharsalus is that it was sometimes identified in ancient sources with Phthia, the home of Achilles. Near Old and New Pharsalus was a &quot;Thetideion&quot;, or temple dedicated to Thetis, the mother of Achilles. However, Phthia, the kingdom of Achilles and his father Peleus, is more usually identified with the lower valley of the Spercheios river, much further south.

==Name of the battle==
Although it is often called the Battle of Pharsalus by modern historians, this name was rarely used in the ancient sources. Caesar merely calls it the &quot;proelium in Thessaliā&quot; (&quot;battle in Thessalia&quot;); Marcus Tullius Cicero and Hirtius call it the &quot;Pharsālicum proelium&quot; (&quot;Pharsalic battle&quot;) or &quot;pugna Pharsālia&quot; (&quot;Pharsalian battle&quot;), and similar expressions are also used in other authors. But Hirtius (if he is the author of the de Bello Alexandrino) also refers to the battle as having taken place at &quot;Palaepharsalus&quot;, and this name also occurs in Strabo, Frontinus, Eutropius, and Orosius. Lucan in his poem about the Civil War regularly uses the name &quot;Pharsālia&quot;, and this term is also used by the epitomiser of Livy and by Tacitus. The only ancient sources to refer to the battle as being at Pharsalus are a certain calendar known as the Fasti Amiternini and the Greek authors Plutarch, Appian, and Polyaenus. It has therefore been argued by some scholars that &quot;Pharsalia&quot; would be a more accurate name for the battle than Pharsalus.

==Opposing armies==

The total number of soldiers on each side is unknown because ancient accounts of the battle focused primarily on giving the numbers of Italian legionaries only, regarding allied non-citizen contingents as inferior and inconsequential. According to Caesar, his own army included 22,000 Roman legionaries distributed throughout 80 cohorts (8 legions), alongside 1,000 Gallic and Germanic cavalry. All of Caesar&#x27;s legions were understrength; some only had about a thousand men at the time of Pharsalus, due partly to losses at Dyrrhachium and partly to Caesar&#x27;s wish to rapidly advance with a picked body as opposed to a ponderous movement with a large army. Another source adds that he had recruited Greek light infantry from Dolopia, Acarnania and Aetolia; these numbered no more than a few thousand. Caesar, Appian and Plutarch give Pompey an army of 45,000 Roman infantry. Osorius describes Pompey as having 88 cohorts of Roman infantry, which at full strength would come to 44,000 men, while Brunt and Wylie estimated Pompey&#x27;s Roman infantry as being as 38,000 men, and Greenhalgh said they contained a maximum of 36,000.

It was in his auxiliary troops and in particular his cavalry, all of which vastly outnumbered Caesar&#x27;s own, that Pompey had his greatest advantage. He seems to have had at his disposal anywhere between 5,000 and 7,000 cavalry, and thousands of archers, slingers and light infantrymen in general. These all formed a remarkably diverse group, including Gallic and Germanic horsemen alongside all polyglot peoples of the east – namely Greeks, Thracians, and Anatolians from the Balkans and Syrians, Phoenicians and Jews from the Levant. To this heterogeneous force Pompey added horsemen conscripted from his own slaves. Many of the foreigners were serving under their own rulers, for more than a dozen despots and petty kings under Roman influence in the east were Pompey&#x27;s personal clients and some elected to attend in person, or send proxies.

===Caesarian legions===

Caesar had the following legions with him:
* the VI legion (later called Ferrata) veterans of his Gallic Wars
* the VII legion (later called Claudia Pia Fidelis) veterans of his Gallic Wars
* the VIII legion (later called Augusta) veterans of his Gallic Wars
* the IX legion (later called Hispania) veterans of his Gallic Wars
* the X legion (Equestris, later called Gemina) veterans of his Gallic Wars
* the XI legion (later called Paterna and Claudia Pia Fidelis, the same title as the seventh) veterans of his Gallic Wars
* the XII legion (later called Fulminata) veterans of his Gallic Wars
* the XIII legion (later also called Gemina, the &#x27;twin&#x27; to the tenth) veterans of his Gallic Wars

The bulk of Caesar&#x27;s army at Pharsalus was made up of his veterans from the Gallic Wars; very experienced, battle-hardened troops who were absolutely devoted to their commander.

==Deployment==
The two generals deployed their legions in the traditional three lines (&quot;triplex acies&quot;), with Pompey&#x27;s right and Caesar&#x27;s left flanks resting on river Enipeus. As the stream provided enough protection to that side, Pompey moved almost all of his cavalry, archers, and slingers to the left, to make the most of their numerical strength. Only a small force of 500–600 Pontic cavalry and some Cappadocian light infantry was placed on his right flank. Pompey stationed his strongest legions in the center and wings of his infantry line, and dispersed some 2,000 re-enlisted veterans throughout the entire line in order to inspire the less experienced. The Pompeian cohorts were arrayed in an unusually thick formation, 10 men deep: their task was just to tie down the enemy foot while Pompey&#x27;s cavalry, his key to victory, swept through Caesar&#x27;s flank and rear. The column of legions was divided under command of three subordinates, with Lentulus in charge of the left, Scipio of the center and Ahenobarbus the right. Labienus was entrusted with command of the cavalry charge, while Pompey himself took up a position behind the left wing in order to oversee the course of the battle.

Caesar also deployed his men in three lines, but, being outnumbered, had to thin his ranks to a depth of only six men, in order to match the frontage presented by Pompey. His left flank, resting on the Enipeus River, consisted of his battle-worn IX legion supplemented by the VIII legion, these were commanded by Mark Antony. The VI, XII, XI and XIII formed the centre and were commanded by Domitius, then came the VII and upon his right he placed his favored X legion, giving Sulla command of this flank – Caesar himself took his stand on the right, across from Pompey. Upon seeing the disposition of Pompey&#x27;s army Caesar grew discomforted, and further thinned his third line in order to form a fourth line on his right: this to counter the onslaught of the enemy cavalry, which he knew his numerically inferior cavalry could not withstand. He gave this new line detailed instructions for the role they would play, hinting that upon them would rest the fortunes of the day, and gave strict orders to his third line not to charge until specifically ordered.

==Battle==
There was significant distance between the two armies, according to Caesar. Pompey ordered his men not to charge, but to wait until Caesar&#x27;s legions came into close quarters; Pompey&#x27;s adviser Gaius Triarius believed that Caesar&#x27;s infantry would be fatigued and fall into disorder if they were forced to cover twice the expected distance of a battle march. Also, stationary troops were expected to be able to defend better against pila throws. Seeing that Pompey&#x27;s army was not advancing, Caesar&#x27;s infantry under Mark Antony and Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus started the advance. As Caesar&#x27;s men neared throwing distance, without orders, they stopped to rest and regroup before continuing the charge; Pompey&#x27;s right and centre line held as the two armies collided.

As Pompey&#x27;s infantry fought, Labienus ordered the Pompeian cavalry on his left flank to attack Caesar&#x27;s cavalry; as expected they successfully pushed back Caesar&#x27;s cavalry. Caesar then revealed his hidden fourth line of infantry and surprised Pompey&#x27;s cavalry charge; Caesar&#x27;s men were ordered to leap up and use their pila to thrust at Pompey&#x27;s cavalry instead of throwing them. Pompey&#x27;s cavalry panicked and suffered hundreds of casualties, as Caesar&#x27;s cavalry came about and charged after them. After failing to reform, the rest of Pompey&#x27;s cavalry retreated to the hills, leaving the left wing of his legions exposed to the hidden troops as Caesar&#x27;s cavalry wheeled around their flank. Caesar then ordered in his third line, containing his most battle-hardened veterans, to attack. This broke Pompey&#x27;s left wing troops, who fled the battlefield.

After routing Pompey&#x27;s cavalry, Caesar threw in his last line of reservesa move which at this point meant that the battle was more or less decided. Pompey lost the will to fight as he watched both cavalry and legions under his command break formation and flee from battle, and he retreated to his camp, leaving the rest of his troops at the centre and right flank to their own devices. He ordered the garrisoned auxiliaries to defend the camp as he gathered his family, loaded up gold, and threw off his general&#x27;s cloak to make a quick escape. As the rest of Pompey&#x27;s army were left confused, Caesar urged his men to end the day by routing the rest of Pompey&#x27;s troops and capturing the Pompeian camp. They complied with his wishes; after finishing off the remains of Pompey&#x27;s men, they furiously attacked the camp walls. The Thracians and the other auxiliaries who were left in the Pompeian camp, in total seven cohorts, defended bravely, but were not able to fend off the assault.

Caesar had won his greatest victory, claiming to have only lost about 200 soldiers and 30 centurions and assigning the Optimate losses to be 60,000 men. These numbers seem suspiciously exaggerated with Appian suggesting the Caesarean losses to be as many as 1,200 men and the Pompeian losses to be 6,000. In his history of the war, Caesar would praise his own men&#x27;s discipline and experience, and remembered each of his centurions by name. He also questioned Pompey&#x27;s decision not to charge.

==Aftermath==
Pompey, despairing of the defeat, fled with his advisors overseas to Mytilene and thence to Cilicia where he held a council of war; at the same time, Cato and supporters at Dyrrachium attempted first to hand over command to Marcus Tullius Cicero, who refused, deciding instead to return to Italy. They then regrouped at Corcyra and went thence to Libya. Others, including Marcus Junius Brutus sought Caesar&#x27;s pardon, travelling over marshlands to Larissa where he was then welcomed graciously by Caesar in his camp. Pompey&#x27;s council of war decided to flee to Egypt, which had in the previous year supplied him with military aid.

In the aftermath of the battle, Caesar captured Pompey&#x27;s camp and burned Pompey&#x27;s correspondence. He then announced that he would forgive all who asked for mercy. Pompeian naval forces in the Adriatic and Italy mostly withdrew or surrendered.

Hearing of Pompey&#x27;s flight to Egypt, Caesar remained in hot pursuit, first landing in Asia and reaching Alexandria on 2 October 48 BC, where he learnt of Pompey&#x27;s murder and then was embroiled in a dynastic dispute between Ptolemy XIII and Cleopatra.

==Importance==

Paul K. Davis wrote that &quot;Caesar&#x27;s victory took him to the pinnacle of power, effectively ending the Republic.&quot; The battle itself did not end the civil war but it was decisive and gave Caesar a much needed boost in legitimacy. Until then much of the Roman world outside Italy supported Pompey and his allies due to the extensive list of clients he held in all corners of the Republic. After Pompey&#x27;s defeat former allies began to align themselves with Caesar as some came to believe the gods favored him, while for others it was simple self-preservation. The ancients took great stock in success as a sign of favoritism by the gods. This is especially true of success in the face of almost certain defeat – as Caesar experienced at Pharsalus. This allowed Caesar to parlay this single victory into a huge network of willing clients to better secure his hold over power and force the Optimates into near exile in search for allies to continue the fight against Caesar.

* &quot;Pharsalia&quot;, a poem by Lucan
* Pharsalia, New York, U.S.
* Pharsalia Technologies, Inc.

In Alexandre Dumas&#x27; &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;, the author makes reference to Caesar&#x27;s purported order that his men try to cut the faces of their opponents – their vanity supposedly being of more value to them than their lives.

In Mankiewicz&#x27;s 1963 film &quot;Cleopatra&quot;, the immediate aftermath of Pharsalus is used as an opening scene to set the action in motion.

<doc id="4009" wikidata="Q44810" url="?curid=4009" title="Bigfoot">
<text>Bigfoot (), also commonly referred to as Sasquatch (), is a large, hairy mythical creature said to inhabit forests in North America, particularly in the Pacific Northwest. Bigfoot is featured in both American and Canadian folklore, and since the mid-20th century has grown into a cultural icon, permeating popular culture and becoming the subject of its own distinct subculture.

Enthusiasts of Bigfoot, such as those within the pseudoscience of cryptozoology, have offered various forms of dubious evidence to prove Bigfoot&#x27;s existence, including anecdotal claims of sightings as well as alleged photographs, video and audio recordings, hair samples, and casts of large footprints. However, the scientific consensus is that Bigfoot, and alleged evidence, is a combination of folklore, misidentification, and hoax rather than a living animal.

Folklorists trace the phenomenon of Bigfoot to a combination of factors and sources, including the European wild man figure, folk tales, and indigenous cultures. Examples of similar folk tales of wild, hair-covered humanoids exist throughout the world, such as the Skunk ape of the southeastern United States, the Almas, Yeren, and Yeti in Asia, the Australian Yowie, and creatures in the mythologies of indigenous people. Wishful thinking, a cultural increase in environmental concerns, and overall societal awareness of the subject have been cited as additional factors.

==Description==
Bigfoot is often described as a large, muscular, and bipedal human or ape-like creature covered in black, dark brown, or dark reddish hair. Anecdotal descriptions estimate a height of roughly , with some descriptions having the creatures standing as tall as . Some alleged observations describe Bigfoot as more human than ape, particularly in regard to the face. In 1971, multiple people in The Dalles, Oregon, filed a police report describing an &quot;overgrown ape&quot;, and one of the men claimed to have sighted the creature in the scope of his rifle but could not bring himself to shoot it because &quot;it looked more human than animal&quot;.

Common descriptions include broad shoulders, no visible neck, and long arms, which many skeptics attribute to misidentification of a bear standing upright. Some alleged nighttime sightings have stated the creature&#x27;s eyes &quot;glowed&quot; yellow or red. However, eyeshine is not present in humans or any other known great apes, and so proposed explanations for observable eyeshine off of the ground in the forest include owls, raccoons, or opossums perched in foliage.

Michael Rugg, the owner of the Bigfoot Discovery Museum, claims to have smelled Bigfoot, stating, &quot;Imagine a skunk that had rolled around in dead animals and had hung around the garbage pits.&quot;

The enormous footprints for which the creature is named are claimed to be as large as long and wide. Some footprint casts have also contained claw marks, making it likely that they came from known animals such as bears, which have five toes and claws.

==History==

===Folklore and early records ===
Ecologist Robert Pyle argues that most cultures have accounts of human-like giants in their folk history, expressing a need for &quot;some larger-than-life creature&quot;. Each language had its name for the creature featured in the local version of such legends. Many names mean something like &quot;wild man&quot; or &quot;hairy man&quot;, although other names described common actions that it was said to perform, such as eating clams or shaking trees. European folklore traditionally had many instances of the &quot;wild man of the woods,&quot; or &quot;wild people,&quot; often described as &quot;a naked creature covered in hair, with only the face, feet and hands (and in some cases the knees, elbows, or breasts) remaining bare&quot; These European wild people ranged from human hermits, to human-like monsters. Upon migrating to North America, myths of the &quot;wild people&quot; persisted, with documented sightings of &quot;wild people&quot; reported in what is now New York state and Pennsylvania. In a 2007 paper titled &quot;Images of the Wildman Inside and Outside Europe&quot; it stated: 

Many of the indigenous cultures across the North American continent include tales of mysterious hair-covered creatures living in forests, and according to anthropologist David Daegling, these legends existed long before contemporary reports of the creature described as Bigfoot. These stories differed in their details regionally and between families in the same community and are particularly prevalent in the Pacific Northwest. Chief Mischelle of the Nlaka&#x27;pamux at Lytton, British Columbia, told such a story to Charles Hill-Tout in 1898.
On the Tule River Indian Reservation, petroglyphs created by a tribe of Yokuts at a site called Painted Rock are alleged by Kathy Moskowitz Strain, author of the 2008 book &quot;Giants, Cannibals, Monsters: Bigfoot in Native Culture&quot;, to depict a group of Bigfoots called &quot;the Family&quot;. The largest glyph is called &quot;Hairy Man&quot;, and they are estimated to be 1,000 years old. According to the Tulare County Board of Education in 1975, &quot;Big Foot, the Hairy Man, was a creature that was like a great big giant with long, shaggy hair. His long shaggy hair made him look like a big animal. He was good in a way, because he ate the animals that might harm people&quot;, and Yokuts parents warned their children not to venture near the river at night or they may encounter the creature.

16th-century Spanish explorers and Mexican settlers told tales of the &quot;los Vigilantes Oscuros&quot;, or &quot;Dark Watchers&quot;, large creatures alleged to stalk their camps at night. In the region that is now Mississippi, a Jesuit priest was living with the Natchez in 1721 and reported stories of hairy creatures in the forest known to scream loudly and steal livestock.

In 1929, Indian agent and teacher J.W. Burns, who lived and worked with the Sts&#x27;ailes Nation (then called the Chehalis First Nation), published a collection of stories titled, &quot;Introducing B.C.&#x27;s Hairy Giants: A collection of strange tales about British Columbia&#x27;s wild men as told by those who say they have seen them&quot;, in Maclean&#x27;s magazine. The stories offered various anecdotal reports of wild people; including an encounter a tribal member had with a hairy wild woman who could speak the language of the Douglas First Nation. Burns coined the term &quot;Sasquatch&quot;, believed to be the anglicized version of &quot;sasq&#x27;ets&quot; (sas-kets), roughly translating to &quot;hairy man&quot; in the Halq&#x27;emeylem language. Burns describes the Sasquatch as, &quot;a tribe of hairy people whom they claim have always lived in the mountains – in tunnels and caves&quot;.

The folklore of the Cherokee includes tales of the &quot;Tsul &#x27;Kalu&quot;, who were described as &quot;slant-eyed giants&quot; that resided in the Appalachian Mountains, and is sometimes associated with Bigfoot.

Members of the Lummi tell tales about creatures known as &quot;Ts&#x27;emekwes&quot;. The stories are similar to each other in the general descriptions of &quot;Ts&#x27;emekwes&quot;, but details differed among various family accounts concerning the creature&#x27;s diet and activities. Some regional versions tell of more threatening creatures: the &quot;stiyaha&quot; or &quot;kwi-kwiyai&quot; were a nocturnal race, and children were warned against saying the names so that the &quot;monsters&quot; would not come and carry them off to be killed. The Iroquois tell of an aggressive, hair covered giant with rock-hard skin known as the &quot;Ot ne yar heh&quot; or &quot;Stone Giant&quot;, more commonly referred to as the &quot;Genoskwa&quot;. In 1847, Paul Kane reported stories by the natives about &quot;skoocooms&quot;, a race of cannibalistic wild men living on the peak of Mount St. Helens. U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, in his 1893 book, &quot;The Wilderness Hunter&quot;, writes of a story he was told by an elderly mountain man named Bauman in which a foul-smelling, bipedal creature ransacked his beaver trapping camp, stalked him, and later became hostile when it fatally broke his companion&#x27;s neck. Roosevelt notes that Bauman appeared fearful while telling the story but attributed the trapper&#x27;s German ancestry to have potentially influenced him.

The Alutiiq of the Kenai Peninsula in Alaska tell of the &quot;Nantinaq&quot;, a Bigfoot-like creature. This folklore was featured in the Discovery+ television series, &quot;Alaskan Killer Bigfoot&quot;, which claims the &quot;Nantinaq&quot; was responsible for the population decrease of Portlock in the 1940s.

Less menacing versions have been recorded, such as one by Reverend Elkanah Walker in 1840. Walker was a Protestant missionary who recorded stories of giants among the natives living near Spokane, Washington. These giants were said to live on and around the peaks of the nearby mountains, stealing salmon from the fishermen&#x27;s nets.

==== Ape Canyon incident ====
On July 16, 1924, an article in &quot;The Oregonian&quot; made national news when a story was published describing a conflict between a group of gold prospectors and a group of &quot;ape-men&quot; in a gorge near Mount St. Helens. The prospectors reported encountering &quot;gorilla men&quot; near their remote cabin. One of the men, Fred Beck, indicated that he shot one of the creatures with a rifle. That night, they reported coming under attack by the creatures, who were said to have thrown large rocks at the cabin, damaging the roof and knocking Beck unconscious. The men fled the area the following morning. The U.S. Forest Service investigated the site of the alleged incident. The investigators found no compelling evidence of the event and concluded it was likely a fabrication. Stories of large, hair covered bipedal ape-men or &quot;mountain devils&quot; had been a persistent piece of folklore in the area for centuries prior to the alleged incident. Today, the area is known as Ape Canyon and is cemented within Bigfoot-related folklore.

===Origin of the &quot;Bigfoot&quot; name===

====Jerry Crew and Andrew Genzoli====

In 1958, Jerry Crew, bulldozer operator for a logging company in Humboldt County, California, discovered a set of large, human-like footprints sunk deep within the mud in the Six Rivers National Forest. Upon informing his coworkers, many claimed to have seen similar tracks on previous job sites as well as telling of odd incidents such as an oil drum weighing having been moved without explanation. The logging company men soon began using the word &quot;Bigfoot&quot; to describe the apparent culprit. Crew and others initially believed someone was playing a prank on them. After observing more of these massive footprints, he contacted reporter Andrew Genzoli of the &quot;Humboldt Times&quot; newspaper. Genzoli interviewed lumber workers and wrote articles about the mysterious footprints, introducing the name &quot;Bigfoot&quot; in relation to the tracks and the local tales of large, hairy wild men. A plaster cast was made of the footprints and Crew appeared, holding one of the casts, on the front page of the newspaper on October 6, 1958. The story spread rapidly as Genzoli began to receive correspondence from major media outlets including the &quot;New York Times&quot; and &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. As a result, the term Bigfoot became widespread as a reference to an apparently large, unknown creature leaving massive footprints in Northern California.

====Ray Wallace and Rant Mullens====

In 2002, the family of Jerry Crew&#x27;s deceased coworker Ray Wallace revealed a collection of large, carved wooden feet stored in his basement. They stated that Wallace had been secretly making the footprints and was responsible for the tracks discovered by Crew.

Wallace was inspired by another hoaxer, Rant Mullens, who revealed information about his hoaxes in 1982. In the 1930s in Toledo, Washington, Mullens and a group of other foresters carved pairs of large feet made of wood and used them to create footprints in the mud to scare huckleberry pickers in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest. The group would also claim to be responsible for hoaxing the alleged Ape Canyon incident in 1924. Mullens and the group of foresters began referring to themselves as the St. Helens Apes, and would later have a cave dedicated to them.

Wallace, also from Toledo, knew Mullens and stated he collaborated with him to obtain a pair of the large wooden feet and subsequently used them to create footprints on the 1958 construction site as a means to scare away potential thieves.

===Other historical uses of &quot;Bigfoot&quot;===

In the 1830s, a Wyandot chief was nicknamed &quot;Big Foot&quot; due to his significant size, strength and large feet. Potawatomi Chief Maumksuck, known as Chief &quot;Big Foot&quot;, is today synonymous with the area of Walworth County, Wisconsin, and has a state park and school named for him. William A. A. Wallace, a famous 19th century Texas Ranger, was nicknamed &quot;Bigfoot&quot; due to his large feet and today has a town named for him: Bigfoot, Texas. Lakota leader Spotted Elk was also called &quot;Chief Big Foot&quot;. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, at least two enormous marauding grizzly bears were widely noted in the press and each nicknamed &quot;Bigfoot.&quot; The first grizzly bear called &quot;Bigfoot&quot; was reportedly killed near Fresno, California, in 1895 after killing sheep for 15 years; his weight was estimated at 2,000 pounds (900 kg). The second one was active in Idaho in the 1890s and 1900s between the Snake and Salmon rivers, and supernatural powers were attributed to it.

====Regional and other names====
Many regions throughout North America have differentiating names for Bigfoot. In Canada, the name &quot;Sasquatch&quot; is widely used in addition to Bigfoot. The United States uses both of these names but also has numerous names and descriptions of the creatures depending on the region and area in which they are allegedly sighted. These include the &quot;Skunk ape&quot; in Florida and other southern states, &quot;Grassman&quot; in Ohio, &quot;Fouke Monster&quot; in Arkansas, &quot;Wood Booger&quot; in Virginia, the &quot;Monster of Whitehall&quot; in Whitehall, New York, &quot;Momo&quot; in Missouri, &quot;Honey Island Swamp Monster&quot; in Louisiana, &quot;Dewey Lake Monster&quot; in Michigan, &quot;Mogollon Monster&quot; in Arizona, the &quot;Big Muddy Monster&quot; in southern Illinois, and &quot;The Old Men of the Mountain&quot; in West Virginia. The term &quot;Wood Ape&quot; is also used by some as a means to deviate from the perceived mythical connotation surrounding the name &quot;Bigfoot&quot;. Other names include &quot;Bushman&quot;, &quot;Treeman&quot;, and &quot;Wildman&quot;.

===Patterson-Gimlin film===
On October 20, 1967, Bigfoot enthusiast Roger Patterson and his partner Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Gimlin were filming a Bigfoot docudrama in an area called Bluff Creek in Northern California. The pair claimed they came upon a Bigfoot and filmed the encounter. The 59.5-second-long video, dubbed the &quot;Patterson-Gimlin film&quot; (PGF), has become iconic in popular culture and Bigfoot-related history and lore. The PGF continues to be a highly scrutinized, analyzed, and debated subject.

Academic experts from related fields have typically judged the film as providing no supportive data of any scientific value, with perhaps the most common proposed explanation being that it was a hoax.

==Proposed explanations==
Various explanations have been suggested for sightings and to offer conjecture on what existing animal has been misidentified in supposed sightings of Bigfoot. Scientists typically attribute sightings to hoaxes or misidentifications of known animals and their tracks, particularly black bears.

===Misidentification===

====Bears====

Scientists theorize that mistaken identification of American black bears as Bigfoot are a likely explanation for most reported sightings, particularly when observers view a subject from afar, are in dense foliage, or there are poor lighting conditions. Additionally, black bears have been observed and recorded walking upright, often as the result of an injury. While upright, adult black bears stand roughly , and grizzly bears roughly .

According to data scientist Floe Foxon, more people report seeing Bigfoot in areas with documented black bear populations. Foxon concludes, &quot;If bigfoot is there, it may be many bears&quot;. Foxon acknowledges that alleged Bigfoot sightings have been reported in areas with minimal or no known black bear populations. She states, &quot;Although this may be interpreted as evidence for the existence of an unknown hominid in North America, it is also explained by misidentification of other animals (including humans), among other possibilities&quot;.

====Escaped apes====

Some have proposed that sightings of Bigfoot may simply be people observing and misidentifying known great apes such as chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans that have escaped from captivity such as zoos, circuses, and exotic pets belonging to private owners. This explanation is often proposed in relation to the Skunk ape, as some scientists argue the humid subtropical climate of the southeastern United States could potentially support a population of escaped apes.

====Humans====

Humans have been mistaken for Bigfoot, with some incidents leading to injuries. In 2013, a 21-year-old man in Oklahoma was arrested after he told law enforcement he accidentally shot his friend in the back while their group was allegedly hunting for Bigfoot. In 2017, a shamanist wearing clothing made of animal furs was vacationing in a North Carolina forest when local reports of alleged Bigfoot sightings flooded in. The Greenville Police Department issued a public notice not to shoot Bigfoot for fear of mistakenly injuring or killing someone in a fur suit. In 2018, a person was shot at multiple times by a hunter near Helena, Montana, who claimed he mistook him for a Bigfoot.

Additionally, some have attributed feral humans or hermits living in the wilderness as being another explanation for alleged Bigfoot sightings. One story, the Wild Man of the Navidad, tells of a wild ape-man who roamed the wilderness of eastern Texas in the mid-19th century, stealing food and goods from residents. A search party allegedly captured an escaped African slave attributed to the story. During the 1980s, several psychologically damaged American Vietnam veterans were stated by the state of Washington&#x27;s veterans&#x27; affairs director, Randy Fisher, to have been living in remote wooded areas of the state.

====Pareidolia====

Some have proposed that pareidolia may explain Bigfoot sightings, specifically the tendency to observe human-like faces and figures within the natural environment. Photos and videos of poor quality alleged to depict Bigfoots are often attributed to this phenomenon and commonly referred to as &quot;Blobsquatch&quot;.

====Misidentified vocalizations====

The majority of mainstream scientists maintain that the source of the sounds often attributed to Bigfoot are either hoaxes, anthropomorphization, or likely misidentified and produced by known animals such as owl, wolf, coyote, and fox.

===Hoaxes===
Both Bigfoot believers and non-believers agree that many reported sightings are hoaxes.

===&quot;Gigantopithecus&quot;===
Bigfoot proponents Grover Krantz and Geoffrey H. Bourne both believed that Bigfoot could be a relict population of the extinct southeast Asian ape species &quot;Gigantopithecus blacki&quot;. According to Bourne, &quot;G. blacki&quot; may have followed the many other species of animals that migrated across the Bering land bridge to the Americas. To date, no &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; fossils have been found in the Americas. In Asia, the only recovered fossils have been of mandibles and teeth, leaving uncertainty about &quot;G. blacki&quot;″s locomotion. Krantz has argued that &quot;G. blacki&quot; could have been bipedal, based on his extrapolation from the shape of its mandible. However, the relevant part of the mandible is not present in any fossils. The consensus view is that &quot;G. blacki&quot; was quadrupedal, as its enormous mass would have made it difficult for it to adopt a bipedal gait.

Anthropologist Matt Cartmill criticizes the &quot;G. blacki&quot; hypothesis:

The trouble with this account is that &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; was not a hominin and maybe not even a crown group hominoid; yet the physical evidence implies that Bigfoot is an upright biped with buttocks and a long, stout, permanently adducted hallux. These are hominin autapomorphies, not found in other mammals or other bipeds. It seems unlikely that &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; would have evolved these uniquely hominin traits in parallel.

Paleoanthropologist Bernard G. Campbell writes: &quot;That &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; is in fact extinct has been questioned by those who believe it survives as the Yeti of the Himalayas and the Sasquatch of the north-west American coast. But the evidence for these creatures is not convincing.&quot;

===Extinct hominidae===

Primatologist John R. Napier and anthropologist Gordon Strasenburg have suggested a species of &quot;Paranthropus&quot; as a possible candidate for Bigfoot&#x27;s identity, such as &quot;Paranthropus robustus&quot;, with its gorilla-like crested skull and bipedal gait —despite the fact that fossils of &quot;Paranthropus&quot; are found only in Africa.

Michael Rugg of the Bigfoot Discovery Museum presented a comparison between human, &quot;Gigantopithecus,&quot; and &quot;Meganthropus&quot; skulls (reconstructions made by Grover Krantz) in episodes 131 and 132 of the Bigfoot Discovery Museum Show. Bigfoot enthusiasts that think Bigfoot may be the &quot;missing link&quot; between apes and humans have promoted the idea that Bigfoot is a descendant of &quot;Gigantopithecus blacki&quot;, but that ape diverged from orangutans around 12 million years ago and is not related to humans.

Some suggest Neanderthal, &quot;Homo erectus&quot;, or &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot; to be the creature, but, like all other great apes, no remains of any of those species have been found in the Americas.

==Scientific view==

Expert consensus is that allegations of the existence of Bigfoot are not credible. Belief in the existence of such a large, ape-like creature is more often attributed to hoaxes, confusion, or delusion rather than to sightings of a genuine creature. In a 1996 &quot;USA Today&quot; article, Washington State zoologist John Crane said, &quot;There is no such thing as Bigfoot. No data other than material that&#x27;s clearly been fabricated has ever been presented.&quot; The author of one review article states that, in their opinion, it is impossible even to consider cryptozoology a science if it continues to consider Bigfoot seriously.

As with other similar beings, climate and food supply issues would make such a creature&#x27;s survival in reported habitats unlikely. Bigfoot is alleged to live in regions unusual for a large, nonhuman primate, i.e., temperate latitudes in the northern hemisphere; all recognized nonhuman apes are found in the tropics of Africa and Asia. Great apes have not been found in the fossil record in the Americas, and no Bigfoot remains are known to have been found. Phillips Stevens, a cultural anthropologist at the University at Buffalo, summarized the scientific consensus as follows:

In the 1970s, when Bigfoot &quot;experts&quot; were frequently given high-profile media coverage, McLeod writes that the scientific community generally avoided lending credence to such fringe theories by refusing even to debate them.

Primatologist Jane Goodall was asked for her personal opinion of Bigfoot in a 2002 interview on National Public Radio&#x27;s &quot;Science Friday&quot;. Goodall responded saying, &quot;Well, now you will be amazed when I tell you that I&#x27;m sure that they exist.&quot;
She later added, &quot;Well, I&#x27;m a romantic, so I always wanted them to exist,&quot; and &quot;Of course, the big, the big criticism of all this is, &quot;Where is the body?&quot; You know, why isn&#x27;t there a body? I can&#x27;t answer that, and maybe they don&#x27;t exist, but I want them to.&quot; In 2012, when asked again by the &quot;Huffington Post&quot;, Goodall said &quot;I&#x27;m fascinated and would actually love them to exist,&quot; adding, &quot;Of course, it&#x27;s strange that there has never been a single authentic hide or hair of the Bigfoot, but I&#x27;ve read all the accounts.&quot;

Paleontologist and author Darren Naish states in a 2016 article for &quot;Scientific American&quot; that if &quot;Bigfoot&quot; existed, an abundance of evidence would also exist that cannot be found anywhere today, making the existence of such a creature exceedingly unlikely.

Naish summarizes the evidence for &quot;Bigfoot&quot; that would exist if the creature itself existed:
* If &quot;Bigfoot&quot; existed, so would consistent reports of uniform vocalizations throughout North America as can be identified for any existing large animal in the region, rather than the scattered and widely varied &quot;Bigfoot&quot; sounds haphazardly reported;
* If &quot;Bigfoot&quot; existed, so would many tracks that would be easy for experts to find, just as they easily find tracks for other rare megafauna in North America, rather than a complete lack of such tracks alongside &quot;tracks&quot; that experts agree are fraudulent;
* Finally, if &quot;Bigfoot&quot; existed, an abundance of &quot;Bigfoot&quot; DNA would already have been found, again as it has been found for similar animals, instead of the current state of affairs, where there is no confirmed DNA for such a creature whatsoever.

===Researchers===

Ivan T. Sanderson and Bernard Heuvelmans, founders of the study of cryptozoology, spent parts of their career searching for Bigfoot. Later scientists who researched the topic included Jason Jarvis, Carleton S. Coon, George Allen Agogino and William Charles Osman Hill, though they later stopped their research due to lack of evidence for the alleged creature.

John Napier asserts that the scientific community&#x27;s attitude towards Bigfoot stems primarily from insufficient evidence. Other scientists who have shown varying degrees of interest in the creature are Grover Krantz, Jeffrey Meldrum, John Bindernagel, David J. Daegling, George Schaller, Russell Mittermeier, Daris Swindler, Esteban Sarmiento, and Mireya Mayor.

===Formal studies===
One study was conducted by John Napier and published in his book &quot;Bigfoot: The Yeti and Sasquatch in Myth and Reality&quot; in 1973. Napier wrote that if a conclusion is to be reached based on scant extant &quot;&#x27;hard&#x27; evidence,&quot; science must declare &quot;Bigfoot does not exist.&quot; However, he found it difficult to entirely reject thousands of alleged tracks, &quot;scattered over 125,000 square miles&quot; (325,000 km2) or to dismiss all &quot;the many hundreds&quot; of eyewitness accounts. Napier concluded, &quot;I am convinced that Sasquatch exists, but whether it is all it is cracked up to be is another matter altogether. There must be &quot;something&quot; in north-west America that needs explaining, and that something leaves man-like footprints.&quot;

In 1974, the National Wildlife Federation funded a field study seeking Bigfoot evidence. No formal federation members were involved and the study made no notable discoveries. Also in 1974, the now defunct North American Wildlife Research Team constructed a &quot;Bigfoot trap&quot; in the Rogue River–Siskiyou National Forest. It was baited with animal carcasses and captured multiple bears, but no Bigfoot. Upkeep of the trap ended in the early 1980s, but in 2006 the United States Forest Service repaired the trap, which today is a tourist destination along the Collings Mountain hiking trail.

Beginning in the late 1970s, physical anthropologist Grover Krantz published several articles and four book-length treatments of Bigfoot. However, his work was found to contain multiple scientific failings including falling for hoaxes.

A study published in the &quot;Journal of Biogeography&quot; in 2009 by J.D. Lozier et al. used ecological niche modeling on reported sightings of Bigfoot, using their locations to infer preferred ecological parameters. They found a very close match with the ecological parameters of the American black bear. They also note that an upright bear looks much like a Bigfoot&#x27;s purported appearance and consider it highly improbable that two species should have very similar ecological preferences, concluding that Bigfoot sightings are likely misidentified sightings of black bears.

In the first systematic genetic analysis of 30 hair samples that were suspected to be from Bigfoot-like creatures, only one was found to be primate in origin, and that was identified as human. A joint study by the University of Oxford and Lausanne&#x27;s Cantonal Museum of Zoology and published in the &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society B&quot; in 2014, the team used a previously published cleaning method to remove all surface contamination and the ribosomal mitochondrial DNA 12S fragment of the sample. The sample was sequenced and then compared to GenBank to identify the species origin. The samples submitted were from different parts of the world, including the United States, Russia, the Himalayas, and Sumatra. Other than one sample of human origin, all but two are from common animals. Black and brown bears accounted for most of the samples, other animals include cow, horse, dog/wolf/coyote, sheep, goat, deer, raccoon, porcupine, and tapir. The last two samples were thought to match a fossilized genetic sample of a 40,000 year old polar bear of the Pleistocene epoch; a second test identified these hairs as being from a rare type of brown bear.

In 2019, the FBI declassified an analysis it conducted on alleged Bigfoot hairs in 1976. Bigfoot researcher Peter Byrne sent the FBI 15 hairs attached to a small skin fragment and asked if the bureau could assist him in identifying it. Jay Cochran Jr., assistant director of the FBI&#x27;s Scientific and Technical Services division responded in 1977 that the hairs were of deer family origin.

==Claims==
Claims about the origins and characteristics of Bigfoot vary. Thomas Sewid, a Bigfoot researcher and member of the Kwakwakaʼwakw tribe claims, &quot;They&#x27;re just the other tribe. They&#x27;re just big, hairy humans with nocturnal vision that choose not to have weapons or fire or permanent shelters&quot;.

The subject of Bigfoot has also crossed over with other paranormal claims, including that Bigfoot, extraterrestrials, and UFOs are related or that Bigfoot are psychic, can shapeshift, are able to cross into different dimensions, or are completely supernatural in origin. Additionally, claims regarding Bigfoot have been associated with conspiracy theories including a government cover-up.

There have also been claims that Bigfoot is responsible for the disappearances of people in the wilderness, such as the 1969 disappearance of Dennis Martin in Great Smoky Mountains National Park.

Additionally, there have been claims that Bigfoot has been responsible for vehicle accidents, vandalizing property, delaying construction, and killing people. In 2022, a man from Oklahoma claimed he killed his friend because he believed he had summoned Bigfoot and was going to be sacrificed to the creature.

===Sightings===
According to &quot;Live Science&quot;, there have been over 10,000 reported Bigfoot sightings in the continental United States. About one-third of all claims of Bigfoot sightings are located in the Pacific Northwest, with the remaining reports spread throughout the rest of North America. Most reports are considered mistakes or hoaxes, even by those researchers who claim Bigfoot exists.

Sightings predominantly occur in the northwestern region of Washington state, Oregon, Northern California, and British Columbia. According to data collected from the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization&#x27;s (BFRO) Bigfoot sightings database in 2019, Washington has over 2,000 reported sightings, California over 1,600, Pennsylvania over 1,300, New York and Oregon over 1,000, and Texas has just over 800. The debate over the legitimacy of Bigfoot sightings reached a peak in the 1970s, and Bigfoot has been regarded as the first widely popularized example of pseudoscience in American culture.

====Alleged behavior====

Some Bigfoot researchers allege that Bigfoot throws rocks as territorial displays and for communication. Other alleged behaviors include audible blows struck against trees or &quot;wood knocking&quot;, further alleged to be communicative.
Skeptics argue that these behaviors are easily hoaxed.
Additionally, structures of broken and twisted foliage seemingly placed in specific areas have been attributed by some to Bigfoot behavior. In some reports, lodgepole pine and other small trees have been observed bent, uprooted, or stacked in patterns such as weaved and crisscrossed, leading some to theorize that they are potential territorial markings. Some instances have also included entire deer skeletons being suspended high in trees. Some researchers and enthusiasts believe Bigfoot construct teepee-like structures out of dead trees and foliage. In Washington state, a team of amateur Bigfoot researchers called the Olympic Project claimed to have discovered a collection of nests. The group brought in primatologists to study them, with the conclusion being that they appear to have been created by a primate.

Jeremiah Byron, host of the &quot;Bigfoot Society Podcast&quot;, believes Bigfoot are omnivores, stating, &quot;They eat both plants and meat. I&#x27;ve seen accounts that they eat everything from berries, leaves, nuts, and fruit to salmon, rabbit, elk, and bear. Ronny Le Blanc, host of &quot;Expedition Bigfoot&quot; on the Travel Channel indicated he has heard anecdotal reports of Bigfoot allegedly hunting and consuming deer. In the 2001 nature documentary &quot;Great North&quot;, a dark bipedal figure was captured on film while the filmmakers were recording a herd of caribou. The footage has sparked debate, as some Bigfoot researchers claim the figure is a Bigfoot stalking the caribou. In 2016, Bigfoot researcher ThinkerThunker released a YouTube video in which he interviewed one of the &quot;Great North&quot; directors, William Reeve, who claims it could not have been a human but was possibly a bear, although he and his crew denied seeing any bears while filming.

Some Bigfoot researchers have reported the creatures moving or taking possession of intentional &quot;gifts&quot; left by humans such as food and jewelry, and leaving items in their places such as rocks and twigs.

Many alleged sightings are reported to occur at night leading some cryptozoologists to hypothesize that Bigfoot may possess nocturnal tendencies. However, experts find such behavior untenable in a supposed ape- or human-like creature, as all known apes, including humans, are diurnal, with only lesser primates exhibiting nocturnality. Most anecdotal sightings of Bigfoot describe the creatures allegedly observed as solitary, although some reports have described groups being allegedly observed together.

====Alleged vocalizations====

Alleged vocalizations such as howls, screams, moans, grunts, whistles, and even a form of supposed language have been reported and allegedly recorded. Some of these alleged vocalization recordings have been analyzed by individuals such as retired U.S. Navy cryptologic linguist Scott Nelson. He analyzed audio recordings from the early 1970s said to be recorded in the Sierra Nevada mountains dubbed the &quot;Sierra Sounds&quot; and stated, &quot;It is definitely a language, it is definitely not human in origin, and it could not have been faked&quot;. Les Stroud has spoken of a strange vocalization he heard in the wilderness while filming &quot;Survivorman&quot; that he stated sounded primate in origin. A number of anecdotal reports of Bigfoot encounters have resulted in witnesses claiming to be disoriented, dizzy and anxious. Some Bigfoot researchers, such as paranormal author Nick Redfern, have proposed that Bigfoot may produce infrasound, which could explain reports of this nature.

====Alleged encounters====

In Fouke, Arkansas, in 1971, a family reported that a large, hair-covered creature startled a woman after reaching through a window. This alleged incident caused hysteria in the Fouke area and inspired the horror movie, &quot;The Legend of Boggy Creek&quot; (1972). The report was later deemed a hoax.

In 1974, the &quot;New York Times&quot; presented the dubious tale of Albert Ostman, a Canadian prospector, who stated that he was kidnapped and held captive by a family of Bigfoot for six days in 1924.

In 1994, former U.S. Forest Service ranger Paul Freeman, a Bigfoot researcher, videotaped an alleged Bigfoot he reportedly encountered in the Blue Mountains in Oregon. The tape, often referred to as the &quot;Freeman footage&quot;, continues to be scrutinized and its authenticity debated. Freeman had previously gained media recognition in the 1980s for documenting alleged Bigfoot tracks, claiming they possessed dermal ridges.

On May 26, 1996, Lori Pate, who was on a camping trip near the Washington state-Canada border, videotaped a dark subject she reported encountering running across a field and claimed it was Bigfoot. The film, dubbed the &quot;Memorial Day Bigfoot footage&quot;, is often depicted in Bigfoot-related media, most notably in the 2003 documentary, &quot;&quot;. In his research, Daniel Perez of the &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; concluded that the footage was likely a hoax perpetuated by a human in a gorilla costume.

In 2018, Bigfoot researcher Claudia Ackley garnered international attention after filing a lawsuit with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) for failing to acknowledge the existence of Bigfoot. Ackley claimed to have encountered and filmed a Bigfoot in the San Bernardino Mountains in 2017, describing what she saw as a &quot;Neanderthal man with a lot of hair&quot;. Ackley contacted emergency services as well as the CDFW; a state investigator concluded that she encountered a bear. Until her death in 2023, Ackley also ran an online support group for individuals claiming to experience psychological trauma as a result of alleged Bigfoot encounters.

In October 2023, a woman named Shannon Parker uploaded a video of an alleged Bigfoot to Facebook. The footage went viral on social media and was shared via various news publications. Shannon Parker reported she and others observed the subject while riding a train on the Durango and Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad in the San Juan Mountains in Colorado. The authenticity of the video was debated across social media. Skeptics on Reddit speculated it was a publicity hoax perpetrated by an RV company located the area, Sasquatch Expedition Campers. The company denied the allegations.

In the early 1990s, 9-1-1 audio recordings were made public in which a homeowner in Kitsap County, Washington, called law enforcement for assistance with a large subject, described by him as being &quot;all in black&quot;, having entered his backyard. He previously reported to law enforcement that his dog was killed recently when it was thrown over his fence. Anthropologist Jeffrey Meldrum notes that any large predatory animal is potentially dangerous, specifically if provoked, but indicates that most anecdotal accounts of Bigfoot encounter result in the creatures hiding or fleeing from people. The 2021 Hulu documentary series, &quot;Sasquatch&quot;, describes marijuana farmers telling stories of Bigfoots harassing and killing people within the Emerald Triangle region in the 1970s through the 1990s; and specifically the alleged murder of three migrant workers in 1993. Investigative journalist David Holthouse attributes the stories to illegal drug operations using the local Bigfoot lore to scare away the competition, specifically superstitious immigrants, and that the high rate of murder and missing persons in the area is attributed to human actions.

Skeptics argue that many of these alleged encounters are easily hoaxed, the result of misidentification, or are outright fabrications.

===Evidence claims===

A body print taken in the year 2000 from the Gifford Pinchot National Forest in Washington state dubbed the Skookum cast is also believed by some to have been made by a Bigfoot that sat down in the mud to eat fruit left out by researchers during the filming of an episode of the &quot;Animal X&quot; television show. Skeptics believe the cast to have been made by a known animal such as an elk.

Alleged Bigfoot footprints are often suggested by Bigfoot enthusiasts as evidence for the creature&#x27;s existence. Anthropologist Jeffrey Meldrum, who specializes in the study of primate bipedalism, possesses over 300 footprint casts that he maintains could not be made by wood carvings or human feet based on their anatomy, but instead are evidence of a large, non-human primate present today in North America. In 2005, Matt Crowley obtained a copy of an alleged Bigfoot footprint cast, called the &quot;Onion Mountain Cast&quot;, and was able to painstakingly recreate the dermal ridges. Michael Dennett of the &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; spoke to police investigator and primate fingerprint expert Jimmy Chilcutt in 2006 for comment on the replica and he stated, &quot;Matt has shown artifacts can be created, at least under laboratory conditions, and field researchers need to take precautions&quot;. Chilcutt had previously stated that some of the alleged Bigfoot footprint plaster casts he examined were genuine due to the presence of &quot;unique dermal ridges&quot;. Dennett states that Chilcutt published nothing to substantiate his claims, nor had anyone else published anything on that topic, with Chilcutt making his statements solely through a posting on the Internet. Dennett states further that no reviews on Chilcutt&#x27;s statements had been performed beyond those by what Dennett states to be, &quot;other Bigfoot enthusiasts&quot;.
In 2007, the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization claimed to have photographs depicting a juvenile Bigfoot allegedly captured on a camera trap in the Allegheny National Forest. The Pennsylvania Game Commission, however, stated that the photos were of a bear with mange. The Pennsylvania Game Commission unsuccessfully attempted to locate the suspected mangey bear. Scientist Vanessa Woods, after estimating that the subject in the photo had approximately long arms and a torso, concluded it was more comparable to a chimpanzee.

In 2015, Centralia College professor Michael Townsend claimed to have discovered prey bones with &quot;human-like&quot; bite impressions on the southside of Mount St. Helens. Townsend claimed the bites were over two times wider than a human bite, and that he and two of his students also found 16-inch footprints in the area.

====Melba Ketchum press release====

After what &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; described as &quot;a five-year study of purported Bigfoot (also known as Sasquatch) DNA samples&quot;, but prior to peer review of the work, DNA Diagnostics, a veterinary laboratory headed by veterinarian Melba Ketchum issued a press release on November 24, 2012, claiming that they had found proof that the Sasquatch &quot;is a human relative that arose approximately 15,000 years ago as a hybrid cross of modern &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; with an unknown primate species.&quot; Ketchum called for this to be recognized officially, saying that &quot;Government at all levels must recognize them as an indigenous people and immediately protect their human and Constitutional rights against those who would see in their physical and cultural differences a &#x27;license&#x27; to hunt, trap, or kill them.&quot; Failing to find a scientific journal that would publish their results, Ketchum announced on February 13, 2013, that their research had been published in the &quot;DeNovo Journal of Science&quot;. The title &quot;DeNovo: Journal of Science&quot; in which the paper was published was found to be a Web site—registered anonymously only nine days before the paper was announced—whose first and only &quot;journal&quot; issue contained nothing but the &quot;Sasquatch&quot; article. Shortly after publication, the paper was analyzed and outlined by Sharon Hill of Doubtful News for the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry. Hill reported on the questionable journal, mismanaged DNA testing and poor quality paper, stating that &quot;The few experienced geneticists who viewed the paper reported a dismal opinion of it noting it made little sense.&quot; &quot;The Scientist&quot; magazine also analyzed the paper, reporting that:

===Documented hoaxes===

*In 1968, the frozen corpse of a supposed hair-covered hominid measuring was paraded around the United States as part of a traveling exhibition. Many stories surfaced as to its origin, such as its having been killed by hunters in Minnesota or American soldiers near Da Nang during the Vietnam War. It was attributed by some to be proof of Bigfoot-like creatures. Primatologist John R. Napier studied the subject and concluded it was a hoax made of latex. Others disputed this, claiming Napier did not study the original subject. the subject, dubbed the Minnesota Iceman, was on display at the &quot;Museum of the Weird&quot; in Austin, Texas.
*Tom Biscardi, long-time Bigfoot enthusiast and CEO of &quot;Searching for Bigfoot, Inc.&quot;, appeared on the &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; paranormal radio show on July 14, 2005, and said that he was &quot;98% sure that his group will be able to capture a Bigfoot which they had been tracking in the Happy Camp, California, area.&quot; A month later, he announced on the same radio show that he had access to a captured Bigfoot and was arranging a pay-per-view event for people to see it. He appeared on &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; again a few days later to announce that there was no captive Bigfoot. He blamed an unnamed woman for misleading him, and said that the show&#x27;s audience was gullible.
*On July 9, 2008, Rick Dyer and Matthew Whitton posted a video to YouTube, claiming that they had discovered the body of a dead Bigfoot in a forest in northern Georgia, which they named &quot;Rickmat&quot;. Tom Biscardi was contacted to investigate. Dyer and Whitton received $50,000 from &quot;Searching for Bigfoot, Inc.&quot; The story was covered by many major news networks, including BBC, CNN, ABC News, and Fox News. Soon after a press conference, the alleged Bigfoot body was delivered in a block of ice in a freezer with the Searching for Bigfoot team. When the contents were thawed, observers found that the hair was not real, the head was hollow, and the feet were rubber. Dyer and Whitton admitted that it was a hoax after being confronted by Steve Kulls, executive director of SquatchDetective.com.
*In August 2012, a man in Montana was killed by a car while perpetrating a Bigfoot hoax using a ghillie suit.
*In January 2014, Rick Dyer, perpetrator of a previous Bigfoot hoax, said that he had killed a Bigfoot in September 2012 outside San Antonio, Texas. He claimed to have had scientific tests conducted on the body, &quot;from DNA tests to 3D optical scans to body scans. It is the real deal. It&#x27;s Bigfoot, and Bigfoot&#x27;s here, and I shot it, and now I&#x27;m proving it to the world.&quot; He said that he had kept the body in a hidden location, and he intended to take it on tour across North America in 2014. He released photos of the body and a video showing a few individuals&#x27; reactions to seeing it, but never released any of the tests or scans. He refused to disclose the test results or to provide biological samples. He said that the DNA results were done by an undisclosed lab and could not be matched to identify any known animal. Dyer said that he would reveal the body and tests on February 9, 2014, at a news conference at Washington University, but he never made the test results available. After the tour, the Bigfoot body was taken to Houston, Texas.
*On March 28, 2014, Dyer admitted on his Facebook page that his &quot;Bigfoot corpse&quot; was another hoax. He had paid Chris Russel of &quot;Twisted Toybox&quot; to manufacture the prop from latex, foam, and camel hair, which he nicknamed &quot;Hank&quot;. Dyer earned approximately US$60,000 from the tour of this second fake Bigfoot corpse. He stated that he did kill a Bigfoot, but did not take the real body on tour for fear that it would be stolen.
*In April 2022, a man in Mobile, Alabama posted photos he claimed were of a Bigfoot to his Facebook page, indicating the Mobile County Sheriff&#x27;s Office validated their authenticity and the team from &quot;Finding Bigfoot&quot; was being dispatched. The photos circulated on social media, attracting the attention of NBC 15. The man admitted the photos were an April Fools&#x27; Day hoax.
*On July 7, 2022, wildlife educator and media personality Coyote Peterson released a Facebook post in which he claimed to have excavated a large primate skull in British Columbia and smuggled it into the United States, further claiming to have initially hidden the discovery due to concerns of government intervention. The post went viral, garnering the attention of multiple scientists who dismissed the finding as a likely replica gorilla skull. Darren Naish, a vertebrate paleontologist, stated, &quot;I&#x27;m told that Coyote Peterson does this sort of thing fairly often as clickbait, and that this is a stunt done to promote an upcoming video. Maybe this is meant to be taken as harmless fun. But in an age where anti-scientific feelings and conspiracy culture are a serious problem it—again—really isn&#x27;t a good look. I think this stunt has backfired&quot;. In a follow-up video, Peterson claimed the situation was staged as a hypothetical example of what not to do in response to such a discovery.

==In popular culture==

Bigfoot has a demonstrable impact in popular culture, and has been compared to Michael Jordan as a cultural icon. In 2018, &quot;Smithsonian&quot; magazine declared, &quot;Interest in the existence of the creature is at an all-time high&quot;. A poll in 2020 suggested that about 1 in 10 American adults believe Bigfoot to be &quot;a real, living creature&quot;. According to a May 2023 data study, the terms &quot;Bigfoot&quot; and &quot;Sasquatch&quot; are inputted via internet search engines over 200,000 times annually in the United States, and over 660,000 times worldwide.

The creature has inspired the naming of a medical company, music festival, amusement park ride, monster truck, and a Marvel Comics superhero. Some commentators have been critical of Bigfoot&#x27;s rise to fame, arguing that the appearance of the creatures in cartoons, reality shows, and advertisements trivialize the potential validity of serious scientific research into their supposed existence. Others propose that society&#x27;s fascination with the concept of Bigfoot stems from human interest in mystery, the paranormal, and loneliness. In a 2022 article discussing recent Bigfoot sightings, journalist John Keilman of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; states, &quot;As UFOs have gained newfound respect, becoming the subject of a Pentagon investigative panel, the alleged Bigfoot sighting is a reminder that other paranormal phenomena are still out there, entrancing true believers and amusing skeptics&quot;.

===In the Pacific Northwest===
Bigfoot and its likeness is symbolic with the Pacific Northwest and its culture, including the Cascadia movement. Two National Basketball Association teams located in the Pacific Northwest have used Bigfoot as a mascot; Squatch of the now-defunct Seattle SuperSonics from 1993 until 2008, and Douglas Fur of the Portland Trail Blazers. Legend the Bigfoot was selected as the official mascot for the 2022 World Athletics Championships held in Eugene, Oregon. In 2024, the United Soccer League (USL) announced the Bigfoot Football Club based in Maple Valley, Washington will begin competing in 2025.

There are laws and ordinances regarding harming or killing Bigfoot in the state of Washington. In 1969, a law was passed that criminalized killing a Bigfoot, making the act a felony, that upon conviction was punishable by a fine of up to $10,000 or by five years imprisonment. In 1984, the law was amended to make the crime a misdemeanor and the entire county was declared a &quot;Sasquatch refuge&quot;. Whatcom County followed suit in 1991, declaring the county a &quot;Sasquatch Protection and Refuge Area&quot;. In 2022, Grays Harbor County, Washington, passed a similar resolution after a local elementary school in Hoquiam submitted a classroom project asking for a &quot;Sasquatch Protection and Refuge Area&quot; to be granted.

===In media===
Bigfoot is featured in various films. It is often depicted as the antagonist in low budget monster movies, but has also been depicted as intelligent and friendly, with a notable example being &quot;Harry and the Hendersons&quot; (1987). &quot;Sasquatch Sunset&quot; (2024) depicts a family of Bigfoot engaging in alleged behaviors reported by Bigfoot enthusiasts and researchers. Bigfoot is also featured in television, notably as a subject of reality and paranormal television series, with notable examples being &quot;Finding Bigfoot&quot; (2011), &quot;Mountain Monsters&quot; (2013), &quot;10 Million Dollar Bigfoot Bounty&quot; (2014), &quot;Expedition Bigfoot&quot; (2019), and &quot;Alaskan Killer Bigfoot&quot; (2021).

===In advocacy===
Bigfoot has been used for environmental protection and nature conservation campaigns and advocacy. Bigfoot was used in an environmental protection campaign, albeit comedically, by the U.S. Forest Service in 2015. Bigfoot is a mascot for the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service&#x27;s &quot;Leave No Trace Principles&quot;, a national educational program to inform the public about reducing the damage caused by outdoor activities. The 360 mile &quot;Bigfoot Trail&quot; in Oregon, is named for the creature. Environmental organization Oregon Wild also uses Bigfoot to promote its nature advocacy, stating, &quot;If there really is a Sasquatch out there, there is definitely more than one, and in order to maintain a healthy breeding population a species of hominid (as Sasquatch is assumed to be) would need extremely vast expanses of uninterrupted forest. Remote Wilderness areas would be prime habitat for Sasquatch, so if there are any out there to protect, making sure Oregon&#x27;s forests get the protections they need to stay untrammeled is of the utmost importance&quot;. In 2024, Bigfoot was used as a mascot for a government recycling campaign in Whitfield County, Georgia.

In the 2018 podcast &quot;Wild Thing&quot;, creator and journalist Laura Krantz argues that the concept of Bigfoot can be an important part of environmental interest and protection, stating, &quot;If you look at it from the angle that Bigfoot is a creature that has eluded capture or hasn&#x27;t left any concrete evidence behind, then you just have a group of people who are curious about the environment and want to know more about it, which isn&#x27;t that far off from what naturalists have done for centuries&quot;.

During the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Bigfoot became a part of many North American social distancing advocacy campaigns, with the creature being referred to as the &quot;Social Distancing Champion&quot; and as the subject of various internet memes related to the pandemic.

===Bigfoot subculture===

There is an entire subculture surrounding Bigfoot. The act of searching for the creatures is often referred to as &quot;Squatching&quot;, &quot;Squatchin&#x27;&quot; or &quot;Squatch&#x27;n&quot;, popularized by the Animal Planet series, &quot;Finding Bigfoot&quot;. Bigfoot researchers and believers are often called &quot;Bigfooters&quot; or &quot;Squatchers&quot;. 20th century Bigfooters Peter C. Byrne, René Dahinden, John Green and Grover Krantz have been dubbed by cryptozoologist and author Loren Coleman as the &quot;Four Horsemen of Sasquatchery&quot;. The 2024 book &quot;The Secret History of Bigfoot&quot; by journalist John O&#x27;Connor explores this subculture of Bigfooters, particularly the wide assortment of beliefs enthusiasts of the subject hold. In 2004, David Fahrenthold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; published an article describing a feud between Bigfoot researchers in the eastern and western United States. Fahrenthold writes, &quot;On the one hand, East Coast Bigfooters say they have to fight discrimination from Western counterparts who think the creature does not live east of the Rocky Mountains. On the other, they have to deal with reports from a more urban population, which includes some who are unfamiliar with wildlife and apt to mistake a black bear for the missing link&quot;.

People have been injured or killed while searching for Bigfoot in the wilderness. On December 28, 2024, two men were found deceased in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest in Washington state after setting off on Christmas to search for Bigfoot. Their disappearance prompted a large scale search and rescue effort, with the Skamania County Sheriff&#x27;s Office concluding they were likely not prepared for the inclement weather.

October 20, the anniversary of the Patterson-Gimlin film recording, is considered by some enthusiasts as &quot;National Sasquatch Awareness Day&quot;. In 2015, World Champion taxidermist Ken Walker completed what he believes to be a lifelike Bigfoot model based on the subject in the Patterson–Gimlin film. He entered it into the 2015 World Taxidermy &amp; Fish Carving Championships in Missouri and was the subject of Dan Wayne&#x27;s 2019 documentary &quot;Big Fur&quot;.

===Tourism and events===

Bigfoot and related folklore has an impact on tourism. Willow Creek, California, considers itself the &quot;Bigfoot Capital of the World&quot;. The Willow Creek Chamber of Commerce has hosted the &quot;Bigfoot Daze&quot; festival annually since the 1960s, drawing on the popularity of the local folklore, notably that of the Patterson-Gimlin film. Jefferson, Texas proclaimed itself the &quot;Bigfoot Capital of Texas&quot; in 2018. The city has hosted the Texas Bigfoot Conference since 2000.

In 2021, U.S. Representative Justin Humphrey, in an effort to bolster tourism, proposed an official Bigfoot hunting season in Oklahoma, indicating that the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation would regulate permits and the state would offer a $3 million bounty if such a creature was captured alive and unharmed. In 2024, mayor Grant Nicely of Derry, Pennsylvania declared Bigfoot the &quot;official cryptid&quot; of the borough and stated, &quot;Willful harm or capture of the species will be punishable by law.&quot; Council Vice-president Nathan Bundy stated, &quot;By proclaiming Bigfoot as our official cryptid and establishing Derry as a sanctuary, we are embracing our local folklore and the rich history that makes our community unique&quot;.

Events such as conferences and festivals dedicated to Bigfoot draw thousands of attendees and contribute to the economies of areas in which they are held. These events commonly include guest speakers, research and lore presentations, and sometimes live music, vendors, food trucks, and other activities such as costume contests and &quot;Bigfoot howl&quot; competitions. Some receive collaboration between local government and corporations, such as the Smoky Mountain Bigfoot Festival in Townsend, Tennessee, which is sponsored by Monster Energy. The 2023 Bigfoot Festival in Marion, North Carolina, saw approximately 40,000 people in attendance, resulting in a large economic boost for the small town of less than 8,000 residents. In February 2016, the University of New Mexico at Gallup held a two-day Bigfoot conference at a cost of $7,000 in university funds. Bigfoot is also featured in events alongside other famous cryptids such as the Loch Ness Monster, Mothman, and Chupacabra.

There are museums dedicated to Bigfoot. In 2019, Bigfoot researcher Cliff Barackman, notable for his role on &quot;Finding Bigfoot&quot;, opened the North American Bigfoot Center in Boring, Oregon. In 2022, The Bigfoot Crossroads of America Museum and Research Center in Hastings, Nebraska, was selected for addition into the archives of the U.S. Library of Congress. The High Desert Museum in Bend, Oregon features an exhibit called &quot;Sensing Sasquatch&quot;, which presents the subject from an Indigenous point-of-view. According to Executive Director Dana Whitelaw, &quot;Rather than the popular, mainstream view of Sasquatch, this exhibition shows Sasquatch as a protective entity for many Indigenous peoples of the High Desert. The exhibit reflects the reverence that Native peoples have for Sasquatch and will be centered on Indigenous art, voices and storytelling&quot;.

===Organizations===
There are several organizations dedicated to Bigfoot. The oldest and largest is the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization (BFRO). The BFRO also provides a free database to individuals and other organizations. Their website includes reports from across North America that have been investigated by BFRO researchers. Other similar organizations exist throughout many U.S. states and their members come from a variety of backgrounds.

The North American Wood Ape Conservancy (NAWAC), a nonprofit organization, states its mission is to &quot;ultimately have the wood ape species documented, protected, and the land they inhabit protected. Author Mike Mays of NAWAC states, &quot;If just anyone hauled in a Bigfoot carcass the blowback from animal rights groups and beyond would be ruinous&quot;.
