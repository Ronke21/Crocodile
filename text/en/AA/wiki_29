<text>Amitabh Bachchan (; 11 October 1942) is an Indian actor who works in Hindi cinema. He is often considered one of the greatest, most accomplished and commercially successful actors in the history of Indian cinema. With a cinematic career spanning over five decades, he has played in over 200 films. Bachchan is often hailed as the &quot;Shahenshah&quot; of Bollywood, Sadi Ke Mahanayak (translated as &quot;Greatest actor of the century&quot; in Hindi), Star of the Millennium, or simply Big B. His dominance in the Indian film industry during the 1970s–80s led the French director François Truffaut to describe it as a &quot;one-man industry&quot;. He is a recipient of several accolades including six National Film Awards and sixteen Filmfare Awards.

Amitabh Bachchan was born in 1942 in Allahabad (now Prayagraj) to the Hindi poet Harivansh Rai Bachchan and his wife, the social activist Teji Bachchan. He was educated at Sherwood College, Nainital, and Kirori Mal College, University of Delhi. His film career started in 1969 as a voice narrator in Mrinal Sen&#x27;s film &quot;Bhuvan Shome&quot;. He first gained popularity in the early-1970s for films, such as &quot;Anand&quot;, &quot;Zanjeer&quot; and &quot;Roti Kapada Aur Makaan&quot;, and achieved greater stardom in later years, being dubbed India&#x27;s &quot;Angry Young Man&quot; for several of his on-screen roles in Hindi films. He consistently starred in top–grossing Indian films from the mid-1970s to the 1980s, such as &quot;Deewaar&quot;, &quot;Sholay&quot;, &quot;Kabhi Kabhie&quot;, &quot;Hera Pheri&quot;, &quot;Amar Akbar Anthony&quot;, &quot;Parvarish&quot;, &quot;Kasme Vaade&quot;, &quot;Don&quot;, &quot;Trishul&quot;, &quot;Muqaddar Ka Sikandar&quot;, &quot;Suhaag&quot;, &quot;Dostana&quot;, &quot;Naseeb&quot;, &quot;Laawaris&quot;, &quot;Namak Halaal&quot;, &quot;Andhaa Kaanoon&quot;, &quot;Coolie&quot;, &quot;Sharaabi&quot; and &quot;Mard&quot;, as well as some of his most acclaimed performances, include &quot;Namak Haraam&quot;, &quot;Abhimaan&quot;, &quot;Majboor&quot;, &quot;Mili&quot;, &quot;Chupke Chupke&quot;, &quot;Do Anjaane&quot;, &quot;Kaala Patthar&quot;, &quot;Shaan&quot;, &quot;Silsila&quot;, &quot;Yaarana&quot;, &quot;Kaalia&quot;, &quot;Shakti&quot;, &quot;Aakhree Raasta&quot;, &quot;Shahenshah&quot; and &quot;Agneepath&quot;. After taking a break from acting in the 1990s, his resurgence was marked in 2000 with &quot;Mohabbatein&quot;. Since then he starred in several successful and acclaimed films like &quot;Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham&quot;, &quot;Aankhen&quot;, &quot;Baghban&quot;, &quot;Khakee&quot;, &quot;Black&quot;, &quot;Bunty Aur Babli&quot;, &quot;Sarkar&quot;, &quot;Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna&quot;, &quot;Bhoothnath&quot;, &quot;Cheeni Kum&quot;, &quot;Paa&quot;, &quot;Piku&quot;, &quot;Pink&quot;, &quot;Badla&quot;, &quot;Brahmāstra: Part One – Shiva&quot; and &quot;Kalki 2898 AD&quot;. For &quot;Piku&quot;, he won his fourth National Film Award for Best Actor, making him the only actor to do so. Bachchan also made an appearance in a Hollywood film, &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; (2013), in which he played a non-Indian Jewish character.

Bachchan has won numerous accolades in his career, including record four National Film Awards in Best Actor category and many awards at international film festivals and award ceremonies. He has won sixteen Filmfare Awards and is the most nominated performer in any major acting category at Filmfare with 34 nominations in Best Actor and 42 nominations overall. The Government of India honoured him with the Padma Shri in 1984, the Padma Bhushan in 2001, the Padma Vibhushan in 2015, and India&#x27;s highest award in the field of cinema, the Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 2018 for his contributions to the arts. The Government of France honoured him with its highest civilian honour, Officer of the Legion of Honour, in 2007 for his exceptional career in the world of cinema and beyond.

In addition to acting, Bachchan has worked as a playback singer, film producer, and television presenter. He has hosted several seasons of the game show &quot;Kaun Banega Crorepati&quot;, India&#x27;s version of the game show franchise, &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;. He also entered politics for a time in the 1980s. Bachchan has also been involved in several humanitarian works and he is a leading brand endorser in India. Beyond the Indian subcontinent, he acquired a large overseas following of the South Asian diaspora, as well as others, in markets including Africa (South Africa, Eastern Africa, and Mauritius), the Middle East (especially Egypt and the UAE), the United Kingdom, Russia, Central Asia, the Caribbean (Guyana, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago), Oceania (Fiji, Australia, and New Zealand), Canada and the United States. Bachchan was voted the &quot;greatest star of stage or screen&quot; in the BBC &quot;Your Millennium&quot; online poll in 1999. In October 2003, &quot;Time&quot; magazine dubbed Bachchan the &quot;Star of the Millennium&quot;.

== Early life and family ==

Bachchan was born on 11 October 1942 in Allahabad (now Prayagraj) to Hindi poet Harivansh Rai Bachchan and social activist Teji Bachchan. Harivansh Rai Bachchan was an Awadhi Hindu Kayastha, who was fluent in Awadhi, Hindi and Urdu. Harivansh&#x27;s ancestors came from a village called Babupatti, in the Raniganj tehsil, in the Pratapgarh district, in the present-day state of Uttar Pradesh, in India. Teji Bachchan was a Punjabi Sikh Khatri from Lyallpur, Punjab, British India (present-day Faisalabad, Punjab, Pakistan). Bachchan has a younger brother, Ajitabh, who is five years younger than him.

Bachchan&#x27;s parents were initially going to name him &quot;Inquilaab&quot; (Hindustani for &quot;Revolution&quot;), inspired by the phrase &quot;Inquilab Zindabad&quot; (&quot;Long live the revolution&quot;) popularly used during the Indian independence struggle; the name &quot;Amitabh&quot; was suggested to his father by poet Sumitranandan Pant. Although his surname was Srivastava, Amitabh&#x27;s father, who opposed the caste system, had adopted the pen name Bachchan (&quot;child-like&quot; in colloquial Hindi), under which he published all of his works. When his father was looking to get him admitted to a school, he and Bachchan&#x27;s mother decided the family&#x27;s name should be Bachchan instead of Shrivastava. It is with this last name that Amitabh debuted in films and used for all other practical purposes, Bachchan has become the surname for all of his immediate family. Bachchan&#x27;s father died in 2003, and his mother in 2007.

Bachchan&#x27;s secondary education was at Boys&#x27; High School &amp; College in Allahabad and Sherwood College in Nainital. He attended Kirori Mal College at the University of Delhi in Delhi. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree from Kirori Mal College in 1962. When Bachchan finished his studies, his father approached Prithviraj Kapoor, the founder of Prithvi Theatre and patriarch of the Kapoor acting family, to see if there was an opening for him, but Kapoor offered no encouragement. Bachchan was a friend of Rajiv Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi, before he became an actor. He used to spend time with them when he was a resident in New Delhi. Bachchan&#x27;s family were very close to the Nehru-Gandhi family of politicians. When Sonia Gandhi first came to India from Italy before her marriage, Bachchan had received her at the Palam International Airport on 13 January 1968. She spent 48 days at Bachchan&#x27;s house with his parents before her wedding to Rajiv.

In the late 1960s, Bachchan applied to be a newsreader for All India Radio in Delhi, but &quot;failed the audition&quot;. He became a business executive for &quot;Bird &amp; Company&quot; in Kolkata (Calcutta), and worked in theatre before starting his film career. It is thought that his mother might have had some influence on his choice of career, for she always insisted that he should &quot;take centre stage&quot;.

== Acting career ==
=== Early career (1969–1972) ===
Bachchan made his film debut in 1969, as a voice narrator in Mrinal Sen&#x27;s National Award–winning film &quot;Bhuvan Shome&quot;. His first acting role was as one of the seven protagonists in the film &quot;Saat Hindustani&quot;, directed by Khwaja Ahmad Abbas and featuring Utpal Dutt, Anwar Ali (brother of comedian Mehmood), Madhu and Jalal Agha. &quot;Anand&quot; (1971) followed, in which Bachchan starred alongside Rajesh Khanna. His role as a doctor with a cynical view of life garnered Bachchan his first Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor. He then played his first antagonist role as an infatuated lover-turned-murderer in &quot;Parwana&quot; (1971). Following Parwana were several films, including &quot;Reshma Aur Shera&quot; (1971). During this time, he made a guest appearance in the film &quot;Guddi&quot; which starred his future wife Jaya Bhaduri. He narrated part of the film &quot;Bawarchi&quot;. In 1972, he made an appearance in the road action comedy &quot;Bombay to Goa&quot; directed by S. Ramanathan which was moderately successful. Many of Bachchan&#x27;s films during this early period did not do well. His only film with Mala Sinha, &quot;Sanjog&quot; (1972) was also a box office failure.

=== Rise to prominence (1973–1974) ===
Bachchan was struggling, seen as a &quot;failed newcomer&quot; who, by the age of 30, had only two successes (as a lead in &quot;Bombay to Goa&quot; and a supporting role in &quot;Anand&quot;). Bachchan was then discovered by screenwriter duo Salim–Javed, consisting of Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar. Salim Khan wrote the story, screenplay and script of &quot;Zanjeer&quot; (1973), and conceived the &quot;angry young man&quot; persona of the lead role. Javed Akhtar came on board as co-writer, and Prakash Mehra, who saw the script as potentially groundbreaking, as the film&#x27;s director. However, they were struggling to find an actor for the lead &quot;angry young man&quot; role; it was turned down by several actors, owing to it going against the &quot;romantic hero&quot; image dominant in the industry at the time. Salim-Javed &quot;saw his talent, which most makers didn&#x27;t. He was exceptional, a genius actor who was in films that weren&#x27;t good.&quot; According to Salim Khan, they &quot;strongly felt that Amitabh was the ideal casting for &quot;Zanjeer&quot;&quot;. Salim Khan introduced Bachchan to Prakash Mehra, and Salim-Javed insisted that Bachchan be cast for the role.

&quot;Zanjeer&quot; was a crime film with violent action, in sharp contrast to the romantically themed films that had generally preceded it, and it established Amitabh in a new persona—the &quot;angry young man&quot; of Bollywood. He earned his first Filmfare Award nomination for Best Actor, with &quot;Filmfare&quot; later considering this one of the most iconic performances in Bollywood history. The film was a blockbuster and one of the highest-grossing films of that year, breaking Bachchan&#x27;s dry spell at the box office and making him a star. It was the first of many collaborations between Salim-Javed and Amitabh; the duo wrote many of their subsequent scripts with Bachchan in mind for the lead role, and insisted on him being cast for their later films. Salim Khan also introduced Bachchan to director Manmohan Desai with whom he formed a long and successful association, alongside Prakash Mehra and Yash Chopra.

Eventually, Bachchan became one of the most successful leading men of the film industry. His portrayal of the wronged hero fighting a crooked system and circumstances of deprivation in films like &quot;Zanjeer&quot;, &quot;Deewaar&quot;, &quot;Trishul&quot;, &quot;Kaala Patthar&quot; and &quot;Shakti&quot; resonated with the masses of the time, especially the youth who harboured a simmering discontent owing to social ills such as poverty, hunger, unemployment, corruption, social inequality and the brutal excesses of The Emergency. This led to Bachchan being dubbed as the &quot;angry young man&quot;, a journalistic catchphrase that became a metaphor for the dormant rage, frustration, restlessness, sense of rebellion and anti-establishment disposition of an entire generation, prevalent in the 1970s.

The year 1973 was also when he married Jaya, and around this time they appeared in several films together: not only &quot;Zanjeer&quot; but also subsequent films such as &quot;Abhimaan&quot;, which was released around the same time after their wedding and was also successful at the box office. Later, he played the role of Vikram, once again along with Rajesh Khanna, in the film &quot;Namak Haraam&quot;, a social drama directed by Hrishikesh Mukherjee and addressing themes of friendship. The film proved to be a superhit and Bachchan won his second Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance. The flow of successes continued for Bachchan in 1974. He began the year with a guest appearance in Dulal Guha&#x27;s blockbuster social drama film &quot;Dost&quot;. After this, he starred in Aravind Sen&#x27;s drama film &quot;Kasauti&quot; and Narendra Bedi&#x27;s crime thriller &quot;Benaam&quot;, both of which ended up as moderate commercial successes. Bachchan&#x27;s next release was Manoj Kumar&#x27;s fourth directional venture &quot;Roti Kapada Aur Makaan&quot;. The film opened to excellent response all over the country, eventually taking top spot at the box office that year and emerging an &quot;All Time Blockbuster&quot; as well as Bachchan&#x27;s biggest upto that point of time. Before the end of year, he delivered a hit in Ravi Tandon&#x27;s crime thriller &quot;Majboor&quot;. Written by Salim-Javed, it also had Pran and Parveen Babi in the lead.

=== Superstardom (1975–1988) ===

In 1975, Bachchan starred in a variety of film genres, from the comedy &quot;Chupke Chupke&quot; and the crime drama &quot;Faraar&quot; to the romantic drama &quot;Mili&quot;. This was also the year in which he starred in two films regarded as important in Hindi cinema history, both written by Salim-Javed, who again insisted on casting Bachchan. The first was &quot;Deewaar&quot;, directed by Yash Chopra, where he worked with Shashi Kapoor, Nirupa Roy, Parveen Babi, and Neetu Singh. The film emerged a blockbuster at the box office and earned him another Filmfare nomination for Best Actor. Indiatimes ranks &quot;Deewaar&quot; among the &quot;Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films&quot;. The other, released on 15 August 1975, was &quot;Sholay&quot;, which became the highest-grossing film ever in India at the time, in which Bachchan played the role of Jaidev. &quot;Deewaar&quot; and &quot;Sholay&quot; are often credited with exalting Bachchan to the heights of superstardom, two years after he became a star with &quot;Zanjeer&quot;, and consolidating his domination of the industry throughout the 1970s and 1980s. In 1999, BBC India declared &quot;Sholay&quot; the &quot;Film of the Millennium&quot; and, like &quot;Deewaar&quot;, it has been cited by &quot;Indiatimes Movies&quot; as among the &quot;Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films&quot;. In that same year, the judges of the 50th annual Filmfare Awards awarded it with the special distinction award called the Filmfare Best Film of 50 Years.
In 1976, he was cast by Yash Chopra in the romantic musical &quot;Kabhi Kabhie&quot;. Bachchan starred as a young poet, Amit Malhotra, who falls deeply in love with a beautiful young girl named Pooja (Rakhee Gulzar) who ends up marrying someone else (Shashi Kapoor). The film was notable for portraying Bachchan as a romantic hero, a far cry from his &quot;angry young man&quot; roles like &quot;Zanjeer&quot; and &quot;Deewaar&quot;. Despite its heavy theme, &quot;Kabhi Kabhie&quot; went on to become a superhit. Its soundtrack composed by Khayyam and lyrics written by Sahir Ludhianvi dominated the year-end annual list of Binaca Geetmala and was one of the best-selling Hindi film albums of the 1970s. Bachchan was again nominated for the Filmfare Best Actor Award for his role in the film. That same year, he played a double role in another hit &quot;Adalat&quot; as father and son. In 1977, he won his first Filmfare Best Actor Award for his performance in &quot;Amar Akbar Anthony&quot;, in which he played the third lead opposite Vinod Khanna and Rishi Kapoor as Anthony Gonsalves. The film was the highest-grossing film of that year. His other major hits that year include &quot;Parvarish&quot; and &quot;Khoon Pasina&quot;.

He once again resumed double roles in films such as &quot;Kasme Vaade&quot; (1978) as Amit and Shankar and &quot;Don&quot; (1978) playing the characters of Don, a leader of an underworld gang and his look-alike Vijay. His performance won him his second Filmfare Best Actor Award. He also gave towering performances in Yash Chopra&#x27;s &quot; Trishul&quot; and Prakash Mehra&#x27;s &quot;Muqaddar Ka Sikandar&quot; both of which earned him further Filmfare Best Actor nominations. 1978 is arguably considered his most successful year at the box office since all of his six releases in the same year, namely &quot;Muqaddar Ka Sikandar&quot;, &quot;Trishul&quot;, &quot;Don&quot;, &quot;Kasme Vaade&quot;, &quot;Ganga Ki Saugandh&quot; and &quot;Besharam&quot; were box office successes, with the former three being the consecutive highest-grossing films of the year, a rare feat in Hindi cinema.

In 1979, Bachchan starred in &quot;Suhaag&quot; which was the highest-earning film of that year. In the same year, he also enjoyed critical acclaim and commercial success with films like &quot;Jurmana&quot;, &quot;Mr. Natwarlal&quot; and &quot;Kaala Patthar&quot;. He was required to use his singing voice for the first time in a song from the film &quot;Mr. Natwarlal&quot; in which he starred with Rekha. Bachchan&#x27;s performance in the film saw him nominated for both the Filmfare Award for Best Actor and the Filmfare Award for Best Male Playback Singer. He also received a Best Actor nomination for &quot;Kaala Patthar&quot; and then went on to be nominated again in 1980 for the Raj Khosla directed superhit film &quot;Dostana&quot;, in which he starred opposite Shatrughan Sinha and Zeenat Aman. His other releases of 1980, &quot;Do Aur Do Paanch&quot; and &quot;Shaan&quot; underperformed with the latter ending its run with average numbers owing to huge costs, but Vijay Anand&#x27;s &quot;Ram Balram&quot; alongside Dharmendra was a box office hit.
This changed in 1981 with back-to-back huge blockbusters in &quot;Naseeb&quot; and &quot;Laawaris&quot;, both of which were among the top 5 highest-grossing films of 1981. 
Bachchan also had two hits, &quot;Yaarana&quot; and &quot;Kaalia&quot; and a moderately successful venture &quot;Barsaat Ki Ek Raat&quot; the same year and received praise for his performance in Yash Chopra&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Silsila&quot;, which attracted considerable attention from the media when it was in production due to its casting. Although the film did not do well commercially, it gained cult status in later years and is considered one of Chopra&#x27;s best works ever. 

In 1982, he played double roles in the musical &quot;Satte Pe Satta&quot; and action drama&quot; Desh Premee&quot; which succeeded at the box office along with highly successful ventures like action comedy &quot;Namak Halaal&quot;, action drama &quot;Khud-Daar&quot; and the critically acclaimed films &quot;Shakti&quot; and &quot;Bemisal&quot;. On 26 July 1982, while filming a fight scene with co-actor Puneet Issar for &quot;Coolie&quot;, Bachchan had a near-fatal intestinal injury. Bachchan was performing his stunts in the film and one scene required him to fall onto a table and then on the ground. However, as he jumped towards the table, the corner of the table struck his abdomen, resulting in a splenic rupture from which he lost a significant amount of blood. He required an emergency splenectomy and remained critically ill in the hospital for many months, at times close to death. There were long queues of well-wishing fans outside the hospital where he was recuperating; the public response included prayers in places of worship and offers to sacrifice limbs to save him. Nevertheless, he resumed filming later that year after a long period of recuperation. The director, Manmohan Desai, altered the ending of &quot;Coolie&quot;: Bachchan&#x27;s character was originally intended to have been killed off; but, after the change of script, the character lived in the end. Desai felt it would have been inappropriate for the man who had just fended off death in real life to be killed on screen. The footage of the fight scene is frozen at the critical moment, and a caption appears onscreen marking it as the instant of the actor&#x27;s injury. The film was released in 1983, and partly due to the huge publicity of Bachchan&#x27;s accident, it emerged an &quot;All Time Blockbuster&quot; and top-grossing film of the year. He then played a triple role in S. Ramanathan&#x27;s action drama &quot;Mahaan&quot;, which proved to be a flop. Other releases that year, &quot;Nastik&quot; and &quot;Pukar&quot; were average fares, but &quot;Andhaa Kaanoon&quot; (in which he had a small role) was a blockbuster. During a stint in politics from 1984 to 1987, five of his completed films were released, out of which four emerged major successes, these were - Manmohan Desai&#x27;s action film &quot;Mard&quot; (1985), which proved to be a massive blockbuster, followed by superhits, &quot;Sharaabi&quot; (1984) and &quot;Geraftaar&quot; (1985) and a hit film &quot;Aakhree Raasta&quot; (1986). After his stint in politics ended, Bachchan returned to films in 1988, playing the title role in Tinnu Anand&#x27;s vigilante action film &quot;Shahenshah&quot;, which opened to bumper response all over the nation and emerged a huge hit as well as the second highest-grossing film of the year.

=== Health issues ===
He was later diagnosed with Myasthenia gravis. The illness weakened him both mentally and physically. At this time he became pessimistic, expressing concern with how a new film would be received, and stating before every release, &quot;Yeh film to flop hogi!&quot; (&quot;This film will flop&quot;). 

=== Career fluctuations, sabbatical, business ventures and acting comeback (1989–1999) ===
After the success of his comeback film however, Bachchan&#x27;s star power began to wane as his subsequent releases like &quot;Gangaa Jamunaa Saraswati&quot; (1988), &quot;Jaadugar&quot;, &quot;Toofan&quot; and &quot;Main Azaad Hoon&quot; (all released in 1989) did not do well commercially. He did gain success during this period with superhits in K.C. Bokadia&#x27;s crime drama film &quot;Aaj Ka Arjun&quot; (1990) and Mukul Anand&#x27;s masala film &quot;Hum&quot; (1991), but this momentum was short-lived and his string of box office failures continued with &quot;Ajooba&quot;, &quot;Indrajeet&quot; and &quot;Akayla&quot;. Notably, despite a decline in number of hits, it was during this era that Bachchan won his first National Film Award for Best Actor for his performance as a Mafia don in the cult film &quot;Agneepath&quot; (1990). 
After the release of Mukul Anand&#x27;s moderately successful, but critically acclaimed 1992 epic film &quot;Khuda Gawah&quot;, Bachchan announced his semi retirement from the film industry. With the exception of the delayed release &quot;Insaniyat&quot; (1994), Bachchan did not appear in any films for five years.

He turned producer during his temporary retirement period, setting up Amitabh Bachchan Corporation, Ltd. (ABCL) in 1996. ABCL&#x27;s strategy was to introduce products and services covering an entire cross-section of India&#x27;s entertainment industry. ABCL&#x27;s operations were mainstream commercial film production and distribution, audio cassettes and video discs, production and marketing of television software, and celebrity and event management. Soon after the company was launched in 1996, the first film it produced was &quot;Tere Mere Sapne&quot;, which was a box office hit and launched the careers of actors like Arshad Warsi and southern film star Simran.

In 1997, Bachchan attempted to make his acting comeback with the film &quot;Mrityudata&quot;, produced by ABCL. Though &quot;Mrityudaata&quot; attempted to reprise Bachchan&#x27;s earlier success as an action hero, the film was a failure both financially and critically. ABCL was the main sponsor of the &quot;1996 Miss World beauty pageant&quot;, Bangalore, but lost millions. The fiasco and the consequent legal battles surrounding ABCL and various entities after the event, coupled with the fact that ABCL was reported to have overpaid most of its top-level managers, eventually led to its financial and operational collapse in 1997. The company went into administration and was later declared a failed company by the Indian Industries board. The Bombay High Court, in April 1999, restrained Bachchan from selling off his Bombay bungalow &#x27;Prateeksha&#x27; and two flats until the pending loan recovery cases of Canara Bank were disposed of. Bachchan had, however, pleaded that he had mortgaged his bungalow to raise funds for his company.

Bachchan attempted to revive his acting career, and eventually had commercial success with &quot;Bade Miyan Chote Miyan&quot; (1998) and &quot;Major Saab&quot; (1998), and received positive reviews for &quot;Sooryavansham&quot; (1999), but other films such as &quot;Lal Baadshah&quot; (1999) and &quot;Kohram&quot; (1999) were box office failures.

=== Return to success (2000–present) ===
In 2000, Bachchan appeared in Aditya Chopra&#x27;s romantic blockbuster &quot;Mohabbatein&quot;. He played a stern, elder figure who rivalled the character of Shahrukh Khan. His role won him his third Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor. Other hits followed, with Bachchan appearing as an older family patriarch in &quot;Ek Rishtaa: The Bond of Love&quot; (2001), &quot;Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...&quot; (2001) and &quot;Baghban&quot; (2003). As an actor, he continued to perform in a range of characters, receiving critical praise for his performances in &quot;Aks&quot; (2001), &quot;Aankhen&quot; (2002), &quot;Kaante&quot; (2002), &quot;Khakee&quot; (2004), &quot;Dev&quot; (2004) and &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot; (2004). His performance in &quot;Aks&quot; won him his first Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor.

One project that did particularly well for Bachchan was Sanjay Leela Bhansali&#x27;s &quot;Black&quot; (2005). The film starred Bachchan as an ageing teacher of a deaf-blind girl and followed their relationship. His performance was unanimously praised by critics and audiences and won him his second National Film Award for Best Actor, his fourth Filmfare Best Actor Award, and his second Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor. Taking advantage of this resurgence, Amitabh began endorsing a variety of products and services, appearing in many television and billboard advertisements. In 2005 and 2006, he starred with his son Abhishek in the films &quot;Bunty Aur Babli&quot; (2005), the &quot;Godfather&quot; adaptation &quot;Sarkar&quot; (2005), and &quot;Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna&quot; (2006). All of them were successful at the box office. His later releases in 2006 and early 2007 were &quot;Baabul&quot; (2006), &quot;Ekalavya&quot; (2007) and &quot;Nishabd&quot; (2007), which failed to do well at the box office but his performances in each of them were praised by critics.

In May 2007, two of his films, the romantic comedy &quot;Cheeni Kum&quot; and the multi-starrer action drama &quot;Shootout at Lokhandwala&quot;, were released. &quot;Shootout at Lokhandwala&quot; did well at the box office and was declared a hit in India, while &quot;Cheeni Kum&quot; picked up after a slow start and was declared a semi-hit by the end of its theatrical run. A remake of his biggest hit, &quot;Sholay&quot; (1975), entitled &quot;Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag&quot;, released in August of that same year and proved to be a major commercial failure in addition to its poor critical reception. The year also marked Bachchan&#x27;s first appearance in an English-language film, Rituparno Ghosh&#x27;s &quot;The Last Lear&quot;, co-starring Arjun Rampal and Preity Zinta. The film premiered at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival on 9 September 2007. He received positive reviews from critics who hailed his performance as his best since &quot;Black&quot;. Bachchan was slated to play a supporting role in his first international film, &quot;Shantaram&quot;, directed by Mira Nair and starring Hollywood actor Johnny Depp in the lead. The film was due to begin filming in February 2008 but due to the writer&#x27;s strike, was pushed to September 2008. The film is currently &quot;shelved&quot; indefinitely.

Vivek Sharma&#x27;s &quot;Bhoothnath&quot;, in which he plays the title role as a ghost, was released on 9 May 2008. &quot;Sarkar Raj&quot;, the sequel of the 2005 film &quot;Sarkar&quot;, released in June 2008 and received a positive response at the box office. &quot;Paa&quot;, which was released at the end of 2009 was a highly anticipated project as it saw him playing his own son Abhishek&#x27;s Progeria-affected 13-year-old son, and it opened to favourable reviews, particularly towards Bachchan&#x27;s performance and was one of the top-grossing films of 2009. It won him his third National Film Award for Best Actor and fifth Filmfare Best Actor Award. In 2010, he debuted in Malayalam film through &quot;Kandahar&quot;, directed by Major Ravi and co-starring Mohanlal. The film was based on the hijacking incident of the Indian Airlines Flight 814. Bachchan declined any remuneration for this film. In 2011 he played an aged retired former gangster in &quot;Bbuddah... Hoga Terra Baap&quot; who protects his son Sonu Sood who is an honest daring police officer from a notorious gangster Prakash Raj who unknowingly hired the latter to perform a contract killing not knowing that the police officer is the gangster&#x27;s son. Despite significant expectations, it had poor returns at the box office. 
In 2013, he made his Hollywood debut in &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; making a special appearance opposite Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire. In 2014, he played the role of the friendly ghost in the sequel &quot;Bhoothnath Returns&quot;. The next year, he played the role of a grumpy father experiencing chronic constipation in the critically acclaimed &quot;Piku&quot; which was also one of the biggest hits of 2015. A review in &quot;Daily News and Analysis&quot; (DNA) summarised Bachchan&#x27;s performance as &quot;The heart and soul of Piku clearly belong to Amitabh Bachchan who is in his elements. His performance in Piku, without doubt, finds a place among the top 10 in his illustrious career.&quot; Rachel Saltz wrote for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Piku&quot;, an offbeat Hindi comedy, would have you contemplate the intestines and mortality of one Bhashkor Banerji and the actor who plays him, Amitabh Bachchan. Bhashkor&#x27;s life and conversation may revolve around his constipation and fussy hypochondria, but there&#x27;s no mistaking the scene-stealing energy that Mr. Bachchan, India&#x27;s erstwhile Angry Young Man, musters for his new role of Cranky Old Man.&quot; Well known Indian critic Rajeev Masand wrote on his website, &quot;Bachchan is pretty terrific as Bhashkor, who reminds you of that oddball uncle that you nevertheless have a soft spot for. He bickers with the maids, harrows his hapless helper, and expects Piku to stay unmarried so she can attend to him. At one point, to ward off a possible suitor, he casually mentions that his daughter isn&#x27;t a virgin; that she&#x27;s financially independent and sexually independent too. Bachchan embraces the character&#x27;s many idiosyncrasies, never once slipping into caricature while all along delivering big laughs thanks to his spot-on comic timing.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; summed up, &quot;Bachchan seizes upon his cranky character part, making Bashkor as garrulously funny in his theories on caste and marriage as his system is backed-up.&quot; The performance won Bachchan his fourth National Film Award for Best Actor and his third Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor.

In 2016, he appeared in the women-centric courtroom drama film &quot;Pink&quot; which was highly praised by critics and with an increasingly good word of mouth, was a resounding success at the domestic and overseas box office. Bachchan&#x27;s performance in the film received acclaim. According to Raja Sen of Rediff.com, &quot;Amitabh Bachchan, a retired lawyer with bipolar disorder, takes up cudgels on behalf of the girls, delivering courtroom blows with pugilistic grace. As we know from Prakash Mehra movies, in each life some Bachchan must fall. The girls hang on to him with incredulous desperation, and he bats for them with all he has. At one point Meenal hangs by Bachchan&#x27;s elbow, words entirely unnecessary. Bachchan towers through Pink – the way he bellows &quot;et cetera&quot; is alone worth having the heavy-hitter at play—but there are softer moments like one where he appears to have dozed off in court, or where he lays his head by his convalescent wife&#x27;s bedside and needs his hair ruffled and his conviction validated.&quot; Writing for &quot;Hindustan Times&quot;, noted film critic and author Anupama Chopra said of Bachchan&#x27;s performance, &quot;A special salute to Amitabh Bachchan, who imbues his character with a tragic majesty. Bachchan towers in every sense, but without a hint of showboating. Meena Iyer of &quot;The Times of India&quot; wrote, &quot;The performances are pitch-perfect with Bachchan leading the way. Writing for NDTV, Troy Ribeiro of Indo-Asian News Service (IANS) stated, &quot;Amitabh Bachchan as Deepak Sehgall, the aged defence lawyer, shines as always, in a restrained, but powerful performance. His histrionics come primarily in the form of his well-modulated baritone, conveying his emotions and of course, from the well-written lines.&quot; Mike McCahill of The Guardian remarked, &quot;Among an electric ensemble, Taapsee Pannu, Kirti Kulhari and Andrea Tariang give unwavering voice to the girls&#x27; struggles; Amitabh Bachchan brings his moral authority to bear as their sole legal ally.

In 2017, he appeared in the third instalment of the &quot;Sarkar&quot; film series: Ram Gopal Varma&#x27;s &quot;Sarkar 3&quot;. That year, he started filming for the swashbuckling action-adventure film &quot;Thugs of Hindostan&quot; with Aamir Khan, Katrina Kaif and Fatima Sana Shaikh which released in November 2018. He co-starred with Rishi Kapoor in &quot;102 Not Out&quot;, a comedy drama film directed by Umesh Shukla based on a Gujarati play of the same name written by Saumya Joshi. This film released in May 2018 and reunited him with Kapoor onscreen after a gap of 27 years.

In 2019, Bachchan appeared in Sujoy Ghosh&#x27;s mystery thriller &quot;Badla&quot;. The film did a lifetime business of worldwide to emerge a box office hit. The following year, he co-starred alongside Ayushmann Khurana in Shoojit Sircar&#x27;s comedy drama &quot;Gulabo Sitabo&quot;, which won him Filmfare Award for Best Actor (Critics). He then collaborated with Emraan Hashmi for &quot;Chehre&quot; (2021), a critical and commercial failure.

The next year, Bachchan had five releases, out of which Ayan Mukerji&#x27;s highly anticipated fantasy action-adventure film &quot;Brahmāstra: Part One – Shiva&quot; proved to be a hit as well as the highest-grossing Hindi film of 2022 while &quot;Jhund&quot;, &quot;Runway 34&quot; and &quot;Uunchai&quot; didn&#x27;t do well at ticket counters, but met with critical acclaim. In 2024, he played Ashwatthama in Nag Ashwin&#x27;s &quot;Kalki 2898 AD&quot;, marking his Telugu debut. Made on a budget of , it opened to positive reception with Bachchan receiving immense praise for his performance. At the box office, it grossed more than to emerge a superhit as well as the second highest-grossing Indian film of 2024.

== Other works ==
=== Television appearances ===
In 2000, Bachchan hosted the first season of &quot;Kaun Banega Crorepati&quot; (&quot;KBC&quot;), the Indian adaptation of the British television game show, &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;. The show was well received. A second season followed in 2005 but its run was cut short by Star Plus when Bachchan fell ill in 2006. He then returned to host the fourth season, and has hosted the show since.

=== Business investments ===
Around 1994, Bachchan started Amitabh Bachchan Corporation Ltd (ABCL), an event management, production and distribution company. But the company fell into debt with a fiasco and went into bankruptcy, subsequently Bachchan became nearly bankrupt. The reasons for this debacle were films that fared poorly at the box office such as &quot;Mrityudata&quot;, &quot;Major Saab&quot; (produced by this organisation), and Miss World 1996 which was organised-managed by ABCL. Due to this he began work for TV, and asked for work to Yash Chopra. Once he said that &#x27;it was the darkest time for him&#x27;.

He has invested in many upcoming business ventures. In 2013, he bought a 10% stake in Just Dial from which he made a gain of 4600 per cent. He holds a 3.4% equity in Stampede Capital, a financial technology firm specialising in cloud computing for financial markets. The Bachchan family also bought shares worth $252,000 in Meridian Tech, a consulting company in the U.S. Recently they made their first overseas investment in Ziddu.com, a cloud-based content distribution platform. Bachchan was named in the Panama Papers and Paradise Papers, leaked confidential documents relating to offshore investment.

== Political career ==
In 1984, Bachchan took a break from acting and briefly entered politics in support of a long-time family friend, Rajiv Gandhi. He contested the Allahabad&#x27;s (presently Prayagraj Lok Sabha constituency) seat for the 8th Lok Sabha against H. N. Bahuguna, former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh. With 68.2% of the votes in his favour, he won by one of the highest victory margins ever in Indian elections. In 1987, &quot;Indian Express&quot; said his brother Ajitabh Bachchan owned an apartment in Switzerland, giving rise to speculations about his involvement in the &quot;Bofors scandal&quot;, revealed in the year before. Bachchan resigned from his seat in July 1987. Ajitabh Bachchan sued Swedish newspaper &quot;Dagens Nyheter&quot; for linking him to Bofors payments in 1990 and won damages in the United Kingdom. Sten Lindstrom, the Swedish police chief who had investigated the case, said in 2012 that &quot;Indian investigators planted the Bachchan angle on&quot; &quot;Dagens Nyheter&quot;.

Bachchan&#x27;s old friend, Amar Singh, helped him during the financial crisis caused by the failure of his company, ABCL. Thereafter Bachchan started supporting the Samajwadi Party, the political party to which Amar Singh belonged. Jaya Bachchan joined the Samajwadi Party and represented the party as an MP in the Rajya Sabha. Bachchan appeared in advertisements and political campaigns for the party. His claim that he too was a farmer in the advertisements was questioned in court.

Bachchan has claimed to have been banned by film press during the emergency years for his family&#x27;s friendship with Indira Gandhi.

Bachchan has been accused of using the slogan &quot;blood for blood&quot; in the context of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. Bachchan has denied the allegation. In October 2014, Bachchan was summoned by a court in Los Angeles for &quot;allegedly instigating violence against the Sikh community&quot;. Bachchan in an interview with journalist Arnab Goswami offered to fight the case in court and asked the accusers to file the same as also present proof. He was also one of the trustees of the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation.

== Humanitarian and social causes ==
Bachchan has been involved with many social causes. For example, he donated to clear the debts of nearly 40 beleaguered farmers in Andhra Pradesh and to clear the debts of some 100 Vidarbha farmers. In 2010, he donated to Resul Pookutty&#x27;s foundation for a medical centre at Kochi, and he has given () to the family of Delhi policeman Subhash Chand Tomar who died after succumbing to injuries during a protest against gang-rape after the 2012 Delhi gang rape case. He founded the Harivansh Rai Bachchan Memorial Trust, named after his father, in 2013. This trust, in association with Urja Foundation, will be powering 3,000 homes in India with electricity through solar energy. In June 2019 he cleared debts of 2100 farmers from Bihar.
Bachchan was made a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador for the polio eradication campaign in India in 2002 and an international ambassador in 2005 and a WHO Goodwill Ambassador for awareness of hepatitis in 2017. In 2013, he and his family donated () to a charitable trust, Plan India, that works for the betterment of young girls in India. He also donated () to the Maharashtra Police Welfare Fund in 2013.

Bachchan was the face of the &#x27;Save Our Tigers&#x27; campaign that promoted the importance of tiger conservation in India. He supported the campaign by PETA in India to free Sunder, a 14-year-old elephant who was chained and tortured in a temple in Kolhapur, Maharashtra.

In 2014, it was announced that he had recorded his voice and lent his image to the Hindi- and English-language versions of the TeachAids software, an international HIV/AIDS prevention education tool developed at Stanford University. He has been a vocal &quot;brand ambassador&quot; of the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) and featured in a few advertisements to promote the campaign.

<doc id="1832" wikidata="Q1124301" url="?curid=1832" title="Allomorph">
<text>In linguistics, an allomorph is a variant phonetic form of a morpheme, or in other words, a unit of meaning that varies in sound and spelling without changing the meaning. The term &quot;allomorph&quot; describes the realization of phonological variations for a specific morpheme. The different allomorphs that a morpheme can become are governed by morphophonemic rules. These phonological rules determine what phonetic form, or specific pronunciation, a morpheme will take based on the phonological or morphological context in which it appears.

==In English==
English has several morphemes that vary in sound but not in meaning, such as past tense morphemes, plural morphemes, and negative morphemes.

===Past tense allomorphs===
For example, an English past tense morpheme is &quot;-ed&quot;, which occurs in several allomorphs depending on its phonological environment by assimilating the voicing of the previous segment or the insertion of a schwa after an alveolar stop. A possible set of assimilations is:

* as or in verbs whose stem ends with the alveolar stops or , such as &#x27;hunted&#x27; or &#x27;banded&#x27; 
* as in verbs whose stem ends with voiceless phonemes other than , such as &#x27;fished&#x27; 
* as in verbs whose stem ends with voiced phonemes other than , such as &#x27;buzzed&#x27; 

The &quot;other than&quot; restrictions above are typical for allomorphy. If the allomorphy conditions are ordered from most restrictive (in this case, after an alveolar stop) to least restrictive, the first matching case usually has precedence. Thus, the above conditions could be rewritten as follows:

* as or when the stem ends with the alveolar stops or 
* as when the stem ends with voiceless phonemes
* as elsewhere

The allomorph does not appear after stem-final although the latter is voiceless, which is then explained by appearing in that environment, together with the fact that the environments are ordered (that is, listed in order of priority). Likewise, the allomorph does not appear after stem-final because the earlier clause for the allomorph has priority. The allomorph does not appear after stem-final voiceless phoneme because the preceding clause for the comes first.

Irregular past tense forms, such as &quot;broke&quot; or &quot;was/were,&quot; can be seen as still more specific cases since they are confined to certain lexical items, such as the verb &quot;break,&quot; which take priority over the general cases listed above.

===Plural allomorphs===
The plural morpheme for regular nouns in English is typically realized by adding an &quot;-s&quot; or &quot;-es&quot; to the end of the noun. However, the plural morpheme actually has three different allomorphs: [-s], [-z], and [-əz]. The specific pronunciation that a plural morpheme takes on is determined by a set of morphological rules such as the following:

* assume that the basic form of the plural morpheme, /-z/, is [-z] (&quot;bags&quot; /bægz/)
* the morpheme /-z/ becomes [-əz] by inserting an [ə] before [-z] when a noun ends in a sibilant (&quot;buses&quot; /bʌsəz/)
* change the morpheme /-z/ to a voiceless [-s] when a noun ends in a voiceless sound (&quot;caps&quot; /kæps/)

===Negative allomorphs===
In English, the negative prefix &quot;in-&quot; has three allomorphs: [ɪn-], [ɪŋ-], and [ɪm-]. The phonetic form that the negative morpheme /ɪn-/ uses is determined by a set of morphological rules; for example:

* the negative morpheme /ɪn-/ becomes [ɪn-] when preceding an alveolar consonant (&quot;intolerant&quot;/ɪn&#x27;tɔlərənt/)
* the morpheme /ɪn-/ becomes [ɪŋ-] before a velar consonant (&quot;incongruous&quot; /ɪŋ&#x27;kɔŋgruəs/)
* the morpheme /ɪn-/ becomes [ɪm-] before a bilabial consonant (&quot;improper&quot; /ɪm&#x27;prɔpər/)

==In Sami languages==
The Sami languages have a trochaic pattern of alternating stressed and unstressed syllables. The vowels and consonants that are allowed in an unstressed syllable differ from those that are allowed in a stressed syllable. Consequently, every suffix and inflectional ending has two forms, and the form that is used depends on the stress pattern of the word to which it is attached. For example, Northern Sami has the causative verb suffix - in which &quot;-&quot; is selected when it would be the third syllable (and the preceding verb has two syllables), and &quot;-&quot; is selected when it would be the third and the fourth syllables (and the preceding verb has three syllables):
* &#x27; has two syllables and so when suffixed, the result is &#x27;.
* has three syllables and so when suffixed, the result is &quot;&quot;.

The same applies to inflectional patterns in the Sami languages as well, which are divided into even stems and odd stems.

==Stem allomorphy==
Allomorphy can also exist in stems or roots, as in Classical Sanskrit:

There are three allomorphs of the stem, , , and , which are conditioned by the particular case-marking suffixes.

The form of the stem , found in the nominative singular and locative plural, is the etymological form of the morpheme. Pre-Indic palatalization of velars resulted in the variant form , which was initially phonologically conditioned. The conditioning can still be seen in the locative singular form, for which the is followed by the high front vowel .

However, the subsequent merging of and into made the alternation unpredictable on phonetic grounds in the genitive case (both singular and plural) as well as the nominative plural and the instrumental singular. Thus, allomorphy was no longer directly relatable to phonological processes.

Phonological conditioning also accounts for the form in the instrumental plural, in which the assimilates in voicing to the following .

==History==
The term was originally used to describe variations in chemical structure. It was first applied to language (in writing) in 1948, by Fatih Şat and Sibel Merve in Language XXIV.

<text>In phonology, an allophone (; from the Greek , , &#x27;other&#x27; and , , &#x27;voice, sound&#x27;) is one of multiple possible spoken soundsor &quot;phones&quot;used to pronounce a single phoneme in a particular language. For example, in English, the voiceless plosive (as in &quot;stop&quot; ) and the aspirated form (as in &quot;top&quot; ) are allophones for the phoneme , while these two are considered to be different phonemes in some languages such as Central Thai. Similarly, in Spanish, (as in &quot;dolor&quot; ) and (as in &quot;nada&quot; ) are allophones for the phoneme , while these two are considered to be different phonemes in English (as in the difference between &quot;dare&quot; and &quot;there&quot;).

The specific allophone selected in a given situation is often predictable from the phonetic context, with such allophones being called positional variants, but some allophones occur in free variation. Replacing a sound by another allophone of the same phoneme usually does not change the meaning of a word, but the result may sound non-native or even unintelligible.

Native speakers of a given language perceive one phoneme in the language as a single distinctive sound and are &quot;both unaware of and even shocked by&quot; the allophone variations that are used to pronounce single phonemes.

==History of concept ==
The term &quot;allophone&quot; was coined by Benjamin Lee Whorf circa 1929. In doing so, he is thought to have placed a cornerstone in consolidating early phoneme theory. The term was popularized by George L. Trager and Bernard Bloch in a 1941 paper on English phonology and went on to become part of standard usage within the American structuralist tradition.

==Complementary and free-variant allophones==

Each time a speaker vocalizes a phoneme, they pronounce it differently from previous iterations. There is debate regarding how real and universal phonemes are (see phoneme for details). Only some of the variation is perceptible to listeners speakers.

There are two types of allophones: complementary allophones and free-variant allophones.

Complementary allophones are not interchangeable. If context requires a speaker to use a specific allophone for a given phoneme (that is, using a different allophone would confuse listeners), the possible allophones are said to be &quot;complementary&quot;. Each allophone from a complementary set is used in a specific phonetic context and may be involved in a phonological process.

Otherwise, allophones are &quot;free-variant&quot;; speakers choose an allophone by habit or preference.

==Allotone==
An allotone is a tonic allophone, such as the neutral tone in Standard Mandarin.

== Examples ==

=== English ===
There are many allophonic processes in English: lack of plosion, nasal plosion, partial devoicing of sonorants, complete devoicing of sonorants, partial devoicing of obstruents, lengthening and shortening vowels, and retraction.

* Aspiration: In English, a voiceless plosive is aspirated (has a strong explosion of breath) if it is at the beginning of the first or a stressed syllable in a word. For example, as in &quot;pin&quot; and as in &quot;spin&quot; are allophones for the phoneme because they cannot be used to distinguish words (in fact, they occur in complementary distribution). English-speakers treat them as the same sound, but they are different: the first is aspirated and the second is unaspirated (plain). Many languages treat the two phones differently.
* Nasal plosion: In English, a plosive () has nasal plosion if it is followed by a nasal, whether within a word or across a word boundary.
* Partial devoicing of sonorants: In English, sonorants () are partially devoiced after a voiceless sound in the same syllable.
* Complete devoicing of sonorants: In English, a sonorant is completely devoiced after an aspirated plosive ().
* Partial devoicing of obstruents: In English, a voiced obstruent is partially devoiced next to a pause or next to a voiceless sound within a word or across a word boundary.
* Retraction: In English, are retracted before .

Because the choice among allophones is seldom under conscious control, few people realize their existence. English-speakers may be unaware of differences between a number of (dialect-dependent) allophones of the phoneme : 

* post-aspirated as in &quot;top&quot;, 
* unaspirated as in &quot;stop&quot;. 
* glottalized (or rather substituted by the glottal stop) as in &quot;button&quot;, but many speakers preserve at least an unreleased coronal stop .

In addition, the following allophones of /t/ are found in (at least) some dialects of American(ised) English;
* flapped as in American English &quot;water&quot;, 
* nasal(ized) flapped as in American English &quot;winter&quot;. 
* unreleased as in American English &quot;cat&quot;, but other dialects preserve the released , or substitute the glottal stop .

However, speakers may become aware of the differences iffor examplethey contrast the pronunciations of the following words:

*&quot;Night rate&quot;: unreleased (without a word space between and )
*&quot;Nitrate&quot;: aspirated or retracted 

A flame that is held in front of the lips while those words are spoken flickers more for the aspirated &quot;nitrate&quot; than for the unaspirated &quot;night rate.&quot; The difference can also be felt by holding the hand in front of the lips. For a Mandarin-speaker, for whom and are separate phonemes, the English distinction is much more obvious than for an English-speaker, who has learned since childhood to ignore the distinction.

One may notice the (dialect-dependent) allophones of English such as the (palatal) alveolar &quot;light&quot; of &quot;leaf&quot; as opposed to the velar alveolar &quot;dark&quot; in &quot;feel&quot; found in the U.S. and Southern England. The difference is much more obvious to a Turkish-speaker, for whom and are separate phonemes, than to an English speaker, for whom they are allophones of a single phoneme.

These descriptions are more sequentially broken down in the next section.

==== Rules for English consonant allophones ====

Peter Ladefoged, a renowned phonetician, clearly explains the consonant allophones of English in a precise list of statements to illustrate the language behavior. Some of these rules apply to all the consonants of English; the first item on the list deals with consonant length, items 2 through 18 apply to only selected groups of consonants, and the last item deals with the quality of a consonant. 
These descriptive rules are as follows:
# Consonants are longer when they come at the end of a phrase. This can be easily tested by recording a speaker saying a sound like &quot;bib&quot;, then comparing the forward and backward playback of the recording. One will find that the backward playback does not sound like the forward playback because the production of what is expected to be the same sound is not identical.
# Voiceless stops are aspirated when they come at the beginning of a syllable, such as in words like &quot;pip, test, kick&quot; . We can compare this with voiceless stops that are not syllable initial like &quot;stop&quot; [stɑp]. The voiceless stop follows the (fricative) here.
# Voiced obstruents, which include stops and fricatives, such as , that come at the end of an utterance like in &quot;improve&quot; or before a voiceless sound like in &quot;add two&quot;) are only briefly voiced during the articulation.
# Voiced stops and affricates in fact occur as partially devoiced at the beginning of a syllable unless immediately preceded by a voiced sound, in which the voiced sound carries over.
# Approximants (in English, these include ) are partially devoiced when they occur after syllable-initial like in &quot;play, twin, cue&quot; .
# Voiceless stops are not aspirated when following after a syllable initial fricative, such as in the words &quot;spew, stew, skew.&quot;
# Voiceless stops and affricates are longer than their voiced counterparts when situated at the end of a syllable. Try comparing &quot;cap&quot; to &quot;cab&quot; or &quot;back&quot; to &quot;bag&quot;.
# When a stop comes before another stop, the explosion of air only follows after the second stop, illustrated in words like &quot;apt&quot; and &quot;rubbed&quot; .
# Many English accents produce a glottal stop in syllables that end with voiceless stops. Some examples include pronunciations of &quot;tip, pit, kick&quot; .
# Some accents of English use a glottal stop in place of a when it comes before an alveolar nasal in the same word (as opposed to in the next word), such as in the word &quot;beaten&quot; .
# Nasals become syllabic, or their own syllable, only when immediately following an obstruent (as opposed to just any consonant), such as in the words &quot;leaden, chasm&quot; . Take in comparison &quot;kiln, film&quot;; in most accents of English, the nasals are not syllabic.
# The lateral , however, is syllabic at the end of the word when immediately following any consonant, like in &quot;paddle, whistle&quot; .
## When considering as liquids, is included in this rule as well as present in the words &quot;sabre, razor, hammer, tailor&quot; .
# Alveolar stops become voiced taps when they occur between two vowels, as long as the second vowel is unstressed. Take for instance mainly American English pronunciations like &quot;fatty, data, daddy, many&quot; .
## When an alveolar nasal is followed by a stop, the is lost and a nasal tap occurs, causing &quot;winter&quot; to sound just like &quot;winner&quot; or &quot;panting&quot; to sound just like &quot;panning&quot;. In this case, both alveolar stops and alveolar nasal plus stop sequences become voiced taps after two vowels when the second vowel is unstressed. This can vary among speakers, where the rule does not apply to certain words or when speaking at a slower pace.
# All alveolar consonants assimilate to dentals when occurring before a dental. Take the words &quot;eighth, tenth, wealth&quot;. This also applies across word boundaries, for example &quot;at this&quot; .
# Alveolar stops are reduced or omitted when between two consonants. Some examples include &quot;most people&quot; (can be written either as or with the IPA, where the is inaudible, and &quot;sand paper, grand master&quot;, where the is inaudible.
# A consonant is shortened when it is before an identical consonant, such as in &quot;big game&quot; or &quot;top post&quot;.
# A homorganic voiceless stop may be inserted after a nasal before a voiceless fricative followed by an unstressed vowel in the same word. For example, a bilabial voiceless plosive can be detected in the word &quot;something&quot; even though it is orthographically not indicated. This is known as epenthesis. However, the following vowel must be unstressed.
# Velar stops become more front when the following vowel sound in the same syllable becomes more front. Compare for instance &quot;cap&quot; vs. &quot;key&quot; and &quot;gap&quot; vs. &quot;geese&quot; .
# The lateral is velarized at the end of a word when it comes after a vowel as well as before a consonant. Compare for example &quot;life&quot; vs. &quot;file&quot; or &quot;feeling&quot; vs. &quot;feel&quot; .

===Other languages===
There are many examples for allophones in languages other than English. Typically, languages with a small phoneme inventory allow for quite a lot of allophonic variation: examples are Hawaiian and Pirahã. Here are some examples (the links of language names go to the specific article or subsection on the phenomenon):
* Consonant allophones
**Final devoicing, particularly final-obstruent devoicing: Arapaho, English, Nahuatl, Catalan and many others
** Voicing of initial consonant 
** Anticipatory assimilation
** Aspiration changes: Algonquin 
** Frication between vowels: Dahalo
** Lenition: Manx, Corsican 
** Voicing of clicks: Dahalo

** Allophones for : Arapaho, Xavante
** Allophones for : Xavante
** Allophones for : Bengali
** Allophones for : Xavante
** Allophones for : Manam

** and as allophones: a number of Arabic dialects
** and as allophones: Some dialects of Hawaiian, and some of Mandarin (e.g. Southwestern and Lower Yangtze)

* Vowel/consonant allophones
** Vowels become glides in diphthongs: Manam
== Representing a phoneme with an allophone ==
Since phonemes are abstractions of speech sounds, not the sounds themselves, they have no direct phonetic transcription. When they are realized without much allophonic variation, a simple broad transcription is used. However, when there are complementary allophones of a phoneme, the allophony becomes significant and things then become more complicated. Often, if only one of the allophones is simple to transcribe, in the sense of not requiring diacritics, that representation is chosen for the phoneme.

However, there may be several such allophones, or the linguist may prefer greater precision than that allows. In such cases, a common convention is to use the &quot;elsewhere condition&quot; to decide the allophone that stands for the phoneme. The &quot;elsewhere&quot; allophone is the one that remains once the conditions for the others are described by phonological rules.

For example, English has both oral and nasal allophones of its vowels. The pattern is that vowels are nasal only before a nasal consonant in the same syllable; elsewhere, they are oral. Therefore, by the &quot;elsewhere&quot; convention, the oral allophones are considered basic, and nasal vowels in English are considered to be allophones of oral phonemes.

In other cases, an allophone may be chosen to represent its phoneme because it is more common in the languages of the world than the other allophones, because it reflects the historical origin of the phoneme, or because it gives a more balanced look to a chart of the phonemic inventory.

An alternative, which is commonly used for archiphonemes, is to use a capital letter, such as /N/ for [m], [n], [ŋ].

In rare cases, a linguist may represent phonemes with abstract symbols, such as dingbats, to avoid privileging any particular allophone.

<doc id="1835" wikidata="Q62155" url="?curid=1835" title="Affix">
<text>In linguistics, an affix is a morpheme that is attached to a word stem to form a new word or word form. The main two categories are derivational and inflectional affixes. Derivational affixes, such as &quot;un-&quot;, &quot;-ation&quot;, &quot;anti-&quot;, &quot;pre-&quot; etc., introduce a semantic change to the word they are attached to. Inflectional affixes introduce a syntactic change, such as singular into plural (e.g. &quot;-(e)s&quot;), or present simple tense into present continuous or past tense by adding &quot;-ing&quot;, &quot;-ed&quot; to an English word. All of them are bound morphemes by definition; prefixes and suffixes may be separable affixes.

==Affixes, infixes and their variations==
Changing a word by adding a morpheme at its beginning is called &quot;prefixation&quot;, in the middle is called &quot;infixation&quot;, and at the end is called &quot;suffixation&quot;.

&quot;Prefix&quot; and &quot;suffix&quot; may be subsumed under the term &quot;adfix&quot;, in contrast to &quot;infix.&quot;

When marking text for interlinear glossing, as shown in the third column in the chart above, simple affixes such as prefixes and suffixes are separated from the stem with hyphens. Affixes which disrupt the stem, or which themselves are discontinuous, are often marked off with angle brackets. Reduplication is often shown with a tilde. Affixes which cannot be segmented are marked with a back slash.

==Lexical affixes==
Semantically speaking, &quot;lexical affixes&quot; or &quot;semantic affixes&quot;, when compared with free nouns, often have a more generic or general meaning. For example, one denoting &quot;water in a general sense&quot; may not have a noun equivalent because all the nouns denote more specific meanings such as &quot;saltwater&quot;, &quot;whitewater&quot;, etc. (while in other cases the lexical suffixes have become grammaticalized to various degrees.) Although they behave as incorporated noun roots/stems within verbs and as elements of nouns, they never occur as freestanding nouns. Lexical affixes are relatively rare and are used in Wakashan, Salishan, and Chimakuan languages — the presence of these is an areal feature of the Pacific Northwest of North America - where they show little to no resemblance to free nouns with similar meanings. Compare the lexical suffixes and free nouns of Northern Straits Saanich written in the Saanich orthography and in Americanist notation:

Some linguists have claimed that these lexical suffixes provide only adverbial or adjectival notions to verbs. Other linguists disagree, arguing that they may additionally be syntactic arguments just as free nouns are and, thus, equating lexical suffixes with incorporated nouns. Gerdts (2003) gives examples of lexical suffixes in the Halkomelem language (the word order here is verb–subject–object):

In sentence (1), the verb &quot;wash&quot; is šak’ʷətəs where šak’ʷ- is the root and -ət and -əs are inflectional suffixes. The subject &quot;the woman&quot; is łə słeniʔ and the object &quot;the baby&quot; is łə qeq. In this sentence, &quot;the baby&quot; is a free noun. (The niʔ here is an auxiliary, which can be ignored for explanatory purposes.)

In sentence (2), &quot;baby&quot; does not appear as a free noun. Instead it appears as the lexical suffix -əyəł which is affixed to the verb root šk’ʷ- (which has changed slightly in pronunciation, but this can also be ignored here). The lexical suffix is neither &quot;the baby&quot; (definite) nor &quot;a baby&quot; (indefinite); such referential changes are routine with incorporated nouns.

==Orthographic affixes==
In orthography, the terms for affixes may be used for the smaller elements of conjunct characters. For example, Maya glyphs are generally compounds of a &quot;main sign&quot; and smaller &quot;affixes&quot; joined at its margins. These are called &quot;prefixes, superfixes, postfixes,&quot; and &quot;subfixes&quot; according to their position to the left, on top, to the right, or at the bottom of the main glyph. A small glyph placed inside another is called an &quot;infix.&quot; Similar terminology is found with the conjunct consonants of the Indic alphabets. For example, the Tibetan alphabet utilizes prefix, suffix, superfix, and subfix consonant letters.

<text>As a literary device or artistic form, an allegory is a or visual representation in which a character, place, or event can be interpreted to represent a meaning with moral or political significance. Authors have used allegory throughout history in all forms of art to illustrate or convey complex ideas and concepts in ways that are comprehensible or striking to its viewers, readers, or listeners.

Writers and speakers typically use allegories to convey (semi-) hidden or complex meanings through symbolic figures, actions, imagery, or events, which together create the moral, spiritual, or political meaning the author wishes to convey. Many allegories use personification of abstract concepts.

==Etymology==


First attested in English in 1382, the word &quot;allegory&quot; comes from Latin &quot;allegoria&quot;, the latinisation of the Greek ἀλληγορία (&quot;allegoría&quot;), &quot;veiled language, figurative&quot;, literally &quot;speaking about something else&quot;, which in turn comes from ἄλλος (&quot;allos&quot;), &quot;another, different&quot; and ἀγορεύω (&quot;agoreuo&quot;), &quot;to harangue, to speak in the assembly&quot;, which originates from ἀγορά (&quot;agora&quot;), &quot;assembly&quot;.

==Types==

Northrop Frye discussed what he termed a &quot;continuum of allegory&quot;, a spectrum that ranges from what he termed the &quot;naive allegory&quot; of the likes of &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;, to the more private allegories of modern paradox literature.
In this perspective, the characters in a &quot;naive&quot; allegory are not fully three-dimensional, for each aspect of their individual personalities and of the events that befall them embodies some moral quality or other abstraction; the author has selected the allegory first, and the details merely flesh it out.

==Classical allegory==

The origins of allegory can be traced at least back to Homer in his &quot;quasi-allegorical&quot; use of personifications of, e.g., Terror (Deimos) and Fear (Phobos) at Il. 115 f. The title of &quot;first allegorist&quot;, however, is usually awarded to whoever was the earliest to put forth allegorical interpretations of Homer. This approach leads to two possible answers: Theagenes of Rhegium (whom Porphyry calls the &quot;first allegorist,&quot; Porph. Quaest. Hom. 1.240.14–241.12 Schrad.) or Pherecydes of Syros, both of whom are presumed to be active in the 6th century B.C.E., though Pherecydes is earlier and as he is often presumed to be the first writer of prose. The debate is complex, since it demands we observe the distinction between two often conflated uses of the Greek verb &quot;allēgoreīn,&quot; which can mean both &quot;to speak allegorically&quot; and &quot;to interpret allegorically.&quot;

In the case of &quot;interpreting allegorically,&quot; Theagenes appears to be our earliest example. Presumably in response to proto-philosophical moral critiques of Homer (e.g., Xenophanes fr. 11 Diels-Kranz), Theagenes proposed symbolic interpretations whereby the Gods of the Iliad actually stood for physical elements. So, Hephestus represents Fire, for instance (for which see fr. A2 in Diels-Kranz). Some scholars, however, argue that Pherecydes cosmogonic writings anticipated Theagenes allegorical work, illustrated especially by his early placement of Time (Chronos) in his genealogy of the gods, which is thought to be a reinterpretation of the titan Kronos, from more traditional genealogies.

In classical literature two of the best-known allegories are the Cave in Plato&#x27;s &quot;The Republic&quot; (Book VII) and the story of the stomach and its members in the speech of Menenius Agrippa (Livy ii. 32).

Among the best-known examples of allegory, Plato&#x27;s Allegory of the Cave, forms a part of his larger work &quot;The Republic.&quot; In this allegory, Plato describes a group of people who have lived chained in a cave all of their lives, facing a blank wall (514a–b). The people watch shadows projected on the wall by things passing in front of a fire behind them and begin to ascribe forms to these shadows, using language to identify their world (514c–515a). According to the allegory, the shadows are as close as the prisoners get to viewing reality, until one of them finds his way into the outside world where he sees the actual objects that produced the shadows. He tries to tell the people in the cave of his discovery, but they do not believe him and vehemently resist his efforts to free them so they can see for themselves (516e–518a). This allegory is, on a basic level, about a philosopher who upon finding greater knowledge outside the cave of human understanding, seeks to share it as is his duty, and the foolishness of those who would ignore him because they think themselves educated enough.

In Late Antiquity Martianus Capella organized all the information a fifth-century upper-class male needed to know into an allegory of the wedding of Mercury and &quot;Philologia&quot;, with the seven liberal arts the young man needed to know as guests. Also, the Neoplatonic philosophy developed a type of allegorical reading of Homer and Plato.

==Biblical allegory==
Other early allegories are found in the Hebrew Bible, such as the extended metaphor in Psalm 80 of the vine and its impressive spread and growth, representing Israel&#x27;s conquest and population of the Promised Land. Also allegorical is Ezekiel 16 and 17, wherein the capture of that same vine by the mighty Eagle represents Israel&#x27;s exile to Babylon.

Allegorical interpretation of the Bible was a common early Christian practice and continues. For example, the recently re-discovered Fourth Commentary on the Gospels by Fortunatianus of Aquileia has a comment by its English translator: &quot;The principal characteristic of Fortunatianus&#x27; exegesis is a figurative approach, relying on a set of concepts associated with key terms in order to create an allegorical decoding of the text.&quot;

==Medieval allegory==
Allegory has an ability to freeze the temporality of a story, while infusing it with a spiritual context. Medieval thinking accepted allegory as having a &quot;reality&quot; underlying any rhetorical or fictional uses. The allegory was as true as the facts of surface appearances. Thus, the Papal Bull &quot;Unam Sanctam&quot; (1302) presents themes of the unity of Christendom with the pope as its head in which the allegorical details of the metaphors are adduced as facts on which is based a demonstration with the vocabulary of logic: &quot;&quot;Therefore&quot; of this one and only Church there is one body and one head—not two heads as if it were a monster... If, then, the Greeks or others say that they were not committed to the care of Peter and his successors, they &quot;necessarily&quot; confess that they are not of the sheep of Christ.&quot; This text also demonstrates the frequent use of allegory in religious texts during the Medieval Period, following the tradition and example of the Bible.

In the late 15th century, the enigmatic &quot;Hypnerotomachia&quot;, with its elaborate woodcut illustrations, shows the influence of themed pageants and masques on contemporary allegorical representation, as humanist dialectic conveyed them.

The denial of medieval allegory as found in the 12th-century works of Hugh of St Victor and Edward Topsell&#x27;s &quot;Historie of Foure-footed Beastes&quot; (London, 1607, 1653) and its replacement in the study of nature with methods of categorisation and mathematics by such figures as naturalist John Ray and the astronomer Galileo is thought to mark the beginnings of early modern science.

==Modern allegory==

Since meaningful stories are nearly always applicable to larger issues, allegories may be read into many stories which the author may not have recognized. This is allegoresis, or the act of reading a story as an allegory. Examples of allegory in popular culture that may or may not have been intended include the works of Bertolt Brecht, and even some works of science fiction and fantasy, such as &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; by C. S. Lewis.

The story of the apple falling onto Isaac Newton&#x27;s head is another famous allegory. It simplified the idea of gravity by depicting a simple way it was supposedly discovered. It also made the scientific revelation well known by condensing the theory into a short tale.

==Poetry and fiction==
While allegoresis may make discovery of allegory in any work, not every resonant work of modern fiction is allegorical, and some are clearly not intended to be viewed this way. According to Henry Littlefield&#x27;s 1964 article, L. Frank Baum&#x27;s &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, may be readily understood as a plot-driven fantasy narrative in an extended fable with talking animals and broadly sketched characters, intended to discuss the politics of the time. Yet, George MacDonald emphasized in 1893 that &quot;A fairy tale is not an allegory.&quot;

J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is another example of a well-known work mistakenly perceived as allegorical, as the author himself once stated, &quot;...I cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations, and always have done so since I grew old and wary enough to detect its presence. I much prefer history – true or feigned – with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of readers. I think that many confuse applicability with allegory, but one resides in the freedom of the reader, and the other in the purposed domination of the author.&quot;

Tolkien specifically resented the suggestion that the book&#x27;s One Ring, which gives overwhelming power to those possessing it, was intended as an allegory of nuclear weapons. He noted that, had that been his intention, the book would not have ended with the Ring being destroyed but rather with an arms race in which various powers would try to obtain such a Ring for themselves. Then Tolkien went on to outline an alternative plot for &quot;Lord of The Rings&quot;, as it would have been written had such an allegory been intended, and which would have made the book into a dystopia. While all this does not mean Tolkien&#x27;s works may not be treated as having allegorical themes, especially when reinterpreted through postmodern sensibilities, it at least suggests that none were conscious in his writings. This further reinforces the idea of forced allegoresis, as allegory is often a matter of interpretation and only sometimes of original artistic intention.

Like allegorical stories, allegorical poetry has two meanings – a literal meaning and a symbolic meaning.

Some unique specimens of allegory can be found in the following works:
*Edmund Spenser – &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;: The several knights in the poem actually stand for several virtues.
*William Shakespeare – &quot;The Tempest&quot;: an allegory of the civilisation/barbarism binary as it pertains to colonialism
*John Bunyan – &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;: The journey of the protagonists Christian and Evangelist symbolises the ascension of the soul from earth to Heaven.
*Nathaniel Hawthorne – &quot;Young Goodman Brown&quot;: The Devil&#x27;s Staff symbolises defiance of God. The characters&#x27; names, such as &quot;Goodman&quot; and &quot;Faith&quot;, ironically serve as paradox in the conclusion of the story.
*Nathaniel Hawthorne – &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;: The letter represents self-reliance from America&#x27;s Puritan and conformity.
*Esteban Echeverría – &quot;The Slaugther Yard:&quot; The slaugther yard represents the violence and brutality of the Federalist regime of Juan Manuel de Rosas in Buenos Aires and his parapolice thugs, the &quot;Mazorca&quot;.
*George Orwell – &quot;Animal Farm&quot;: The pigs stand for political figures of the Russian Revolution.
*Julio Cortázar – &quot;Casa Tomada:&quot; The take over of the protagonists&#x27; house is said to represent Peronism taking over Argentina.
*László Krasznahorkai – &quot;The Melancholy of Resistance&quot; and the film &quot;Werckmeister Harmonies&quot;: It uses a circus to describe an occupying dysfunctional government.
*Edgar Allan Poe – &quot;The Masque of the Red Death&quot;: The story can be read as an allegory for humans&#x27; inability to escape death.
*Arthur Miller – &quot;The Crucible&quot;: The Salem witch trials are thought to be an allegory for McCarthyism and the blacklisting of Communists in the United States of America.

*Shel Silverstein – &quot;The Giving Tree&quot;: The book has been described as an allegory about relationships; between parents and children, between romantic partners, or between humans and the environment.

<doc id="1839" wikidata="Q81915" url="?curid=1839" title="Allotropy">
<text>Allotropy or allotropism () is the property of some chemical elements to exist in two or more different forms, in the same physical state, known as allotropes of the elements. Allotropes are different structural modifications of an element: the atoms of the element are bonded together in different manners.
For example, the allotropes of carbon include diamond (the carbon atoms are bonded together to form a cubic lattice of tetrahedra), graphite (the carbon atoms are bonded together in sheets of a hexagonal lattice), graphene (single sheets of graphite), and fullerenes (the carbon atoms are bonded together in spherical, tubular, or ellipsoidal formations).

The term &quot;allotropy&quot; is used for elements only, not for compounds. The more general term, used for any compound, is polymorphism, although its use is usually restricted to solid materials such as crystals. Allotropy refers only to different forms of an element within the same physical phase (the state of matter, such as a solid, liquid or gas). The differences between these states of matter would not alone constitute examples of allotropy. Allotropes of chemical elements are frequently referred to as &quot;polymorphs&quot; or as &quot;phases&quot; of the element.

For some elements, allotropes have different molecular formulae or different crystalline structures, as well as a difference in physical phase; for example, two allotropes of oxygen (dioxygen, O2, and ozone, O3) can both exist in the solid, liquid and gaseous states. Other elements do not maintain distinct allotropes in different physical phases; for example, phosphorus has numerous solid allotropes, which all revert to the same P4 form when melted to the liquid state.

==History==
The concept of allotropy was originally proposed in 1840 by the Swedish scientist Baron Jöns Jakob Berzelius (1779–1848). The term is derived . After the acceptance of Avogadro&#x27;s hypothesis in 1860, it was understood that elements could exist as polyatomic molecules, and two allotropes of oxygen were recognized as O2 and O3. In the early 20th century, it was recognized that other cases such as carbon were due to differences in crystal structure.

By 1912, Ostwald noted that the allotropy of elements is just a special case of the phenomenon of polymorphism known for compounds, and proposed that the terms allotrope and allotropy be abandoned and replaced by polymorph and polymorphism. Although many other chemists have repeated this advice, IUPAC and most chemistry texts still favour the usage of allotrope and allotropy for elements only.

==Differences in properties of an element&#x27;s allotropes==
Allotropes are different structural forms of the same element and can exhibit quite different physical properties and chemical behaviours. The change between allotropic forms is triggered by the same forces that affect other structures, i.e., pressure, light, and temperature. Therefore, the stability of the particular allotropes depends on particular conditions. For instance, iron changes from a body-centered cubic structure (ferrite) to a face-centered cubic structure (austenite) above 906 °C, and tin undergoes a modification known as tin pest from a metallic form to a semimetallic form below 13.2 °C (55.8 °F). As an example of allotropes having different chemical behaviour, ozone (O3) is a much stronger oxidizing agent than dioxygen (O2).

==List of allotropes==
Typically, elements capable of variable coordination number and/or oxidation states tend to exhibit greater numbers of allotropic forms. Another contributing factor is the ability of an element to catenate.

Examples of allotropes include:

===Non-metals===
===Metalloids===
===Metals===

Among the metallic elements that occur in nature in significant quantities (56 up to U, without Tc and Pm), almost half (27) are allotropic at ambient pressure: Li, Be, Na, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe, Co, Sr, Y, Zr, Sn, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Yb, Hf, Tl, Th, Pa and U. Some phase transitions between allotropic forms of technologically relevant metals are those of Ti at 882 °C, Fe at 912 °C and 1,394 °C, Co at 422 °C, Zr at 863 °C, Sn at 13 °C and U at 668 °C and 776 °C.

 Most stable structure under standard conditions.&lt;br&gt;
 Structures stable below room temperature.&lt;br&gt;
 Structures stable above room temperature.&lt;br&gt;
 Structures stable above atmospheric pressure.

====Lanthanides and actinides====
* Cerium, samarium, dysprosium and ytterbium have three allotropes.
* Praseodymium, neodymium, gadolinium and terbium have two allotropes.
* Plutonium has six distinct solid allotropes under &quot;normal&quot; pressures. Their densities vary within a ratio of some 4:3, which vastly complicates all kinds of work with the metal (particularly casting, machining, and storage). A seventh plutonium allotrope exists at very high pressures. The transuranium metals Np, Am, and Cm are also allotropic.
* Promethium, americium, berkelium and californium have three allotropes each.

== Nanoallotropes ==
In 2017, the concept of nanoallotropy was proposed. Nanoallotropes, or allotropes of nanomaterials, are nanoporous materials that have the same chemical composition (e.g., Au), but differ in their architecture at the nanoscale (that is, on a scale 10 to 100 times the dimensions of individual atoms). Such nanoallotropes may help create ultra-small electronic devices and find other industrial applications. The different nanoscale architectures translate into different properties, as was demonstrated for surface-enhanced Raman scattering performed on several different nanoallotropes of gold. A two-step method for generating nanoallotropes was also created.

<doc id="1840" wikidata="Q312326" url="?curid=1840" title="Agathocles of Syracuse">
<text>Agathocles (, &quot;Agathoklḗs&quot;; 361–289 BC) was a tyrant of Syracuse from 317 BC and king of much of Sicily from 304 BC until his death. Agathocles began his career as a military officer, and raised his profile as a supporter of the democratic faction in Syracuse against the oligarchic civic government. His opponents forced him into exile and he became a mercenary leader. He eventually made his way back to Syracuse and was elected as a general. A few years later he took control through a coup d&#x27;état. In practice he was a tyrant, although a democratic constitution theoretically remained in force.

Agathocles had led a long, costly war against the Carthaginians, who ruled the western half of Sicily between 311 and 306 BC. In a military campaign he led the invasion of Carthage&#x27;s North African heartland in 310 BC. After initial successes he abandoned his army in Africa and returned to Sicily in 307 BC, where he made peace with the Carthaginians and restored the &quot;status quo ante bellum&quot;. He then assumed the royal title and managed to bring almost the entire Greek portion of Sicily, and part of Calabria, under his control. Agathocles came close to of bringing the entirety of Magna Graecia under his control but his attempt to establish a dynasty fell apart as a result of conflict within his family. He was assassinated in 289 BC and his kingdom instantly collapsed.

==Biography==
Agathocles was a son of Carcinus, who came from Rhegium. Carcinus was expelled from his hometown, so he migrated to Thermae Himeraeae and married a local citizen woman. Thermae, which was located on the north coast of Sicily, belonged to the western part of the island, which was under Carthaginian control. The couple had two sons, Antander and Agathocles. In 343 BC, when Agathocles was around eighteen years old, the family re-settled in Syracuse. Carcinus had answered a call from the commander Timoleon, which had overthrown the tyrannical regime of Dionysius II. Timoleon sought new citizens for the city, which had been depopulated by the civil wars. Thus, Carcinus and Agathocles acquired Syracusan citizenship. According to the sources, Carcinus was a potter and Agathocles followed him in his profession. Modern historians generally argue that he must have been a wealthy man who owned a pottery workshop. In later times, Agathocles frequently advertised his lower class origins and used them as part of his self-presentation as a ruler, since performative modesty and presenting himself as a man of the people would be important parts of his persona.

Agathocles began his military career during Timoleon&#x27;s rule. He initially served as a soldier and then as an officer. Later, after Timoleon&#x27;s death in 337 BC, Agathocles participated in an expedition against Acragas and began a relationship with the general, Damas, who promoted him to chiliarch. After Damas&#x27; death, Agathocles married his widow. This made him one of the richest men in Syracuse, which gave him a good platform to begin his political ascent.

After Timoleon&#x27;s death, Syracuse descended into the traditional conflict between democrats and oligarchs. The oligarchs had the upper hand and ruled the city as a club, called &quot;the Six Hundred.&quot; Agathocles&#x27; elder brother, Antander, was elected to a generalship, during this period, so he must have had good relationships with members of the ruling circle. Agathocles, on the other hand, spoke in the people&#x27;s assembly and placed himself on the side of the opposition democrats, but he was unable to overcome their power. After a successful campaign to defend Croton in southern Italy from the Bruttii, he denied an award for bravery which he felt he had earnt. After this, he openly opposed the government and openly accused the leading oligarchs, Sosistratus and Heracleides, of seeking to become tyrants. These accusations were not successful and the two oligarchs solidified their power. Agathocles&#x27; situation in Syracuse was then untenable and he declared that he was compelled to leave the city. This does not necessarily mean that he was formally exiled.

=== Double exile ===
Agathocles went to southern Italy, where he led the life of a mercenary captain. At the same time, he built up an independent power base, as preparation for a return to Syracuse. His first military effort was a failure, however: he attempted to bring the major city of Croton in Calabria under his control by force, probably in alliance with the local democrats, but he was completely defeated and had to flee with his surviving followers to Tarentum. The Tarentines accepted him into their mercenary forces, but they distrusted him because of his ambition and plots, which led to his dismissal. After this, he gathered together democrats who had been expelled from their cities by local oligarchs. An opportunity appeared at Rhegium, the hometown of Agathocles&#x27; father. There, the democrats were in power, but the city was attacked by forces led by the Syracusan oligarchs, who wanted to help the local oligarchs take power by force. Agathocles defeated this Syracusan expeditionary force, which destabilised Sosistratus and Heracleides&#x27; position in Syracuse and as a result they were overthrown in a coup. The democrats returned to power and drove the leading oligarchs out of Syracuse. The exiled oligarchs allied themselves with the Carthaginians. These developments allowed Agathocles to return home around 322 BC.

Agathocles distinguished himself in the subsequent battles against the Carthaginians and oligarchs, but did not manage to acquire a leading position in the city. Instead, the Syracusans chose to request a commander from their mother city, Corinth, in accordance with a law established by Timoleon. The Corinthians sent one Acestorides, who organised an amnesty for the oligarchs, made peace with the Carthaginians, and exiled Agathocles. The radical democrats were forced out and a moderate oligarchy was established. Acestorides even attempted to have Agathocles assassinated. Agathocles established a private army, apparently funded from his own assets. He took advantage of the fact that the Syracusans were considered oppressive by other cities in Sicily and successfully presented himself as a supporter of these cities&#x27; interests against the Syracusans. He managed to take over Leontini and even led an attack on Syracuse. The situation became so tenuous for the oligarchs in Syracuse that they reached out to the Carthaginians for help.

Agathocles outpaced the oligarchs. He negotiated with the Carthaginian commander in Sicily, Hamilcar, and convinced him to withdraw. Allegedly, they had concluded a personal agreement to support each other in establishing themselves as sole rulers of their respective cities. After the loss of Carthaginian support, Syracuse was isolated. The citizens, who did not really wish to fight for oligarchy, agreed to allow Agathocles to return home. He swore the Syracuse &quot;great oath&quot;, promising that he would not establish a tyranny. After that, he was elected commander in chief of the Syracusan army in 319/318 BC.

=== Seizure of power ===
The position of Agathocles within the city of Syracuse was initially that of a regular military commander, with wide but limited powers. His title was General and Guardian of the Peace (). In Syracuse, the surviving oligarchs banded together as &quot;The Six Hundred&quot; and continued to oppose him. Agathocles took advantage of the conflicts between the Syracusans and the non-Greek Sicels and between the rich and poor within Syracuse to overcome these opponents. On the pretext of taking military action against external enemies, he was able to gather a powerful force, which was loyal only to him, without raising suspicion.

In 317/6 or 316/5 BC, Agathocles used this force to launch a coup. At a meeting that the leading members of the opposition party had been invited to, he accused around forty of the oligarchs there of planning an attack on him and had them arrested and executed on the spot. His trumpeters gave the sign for battle and a general slaughter took place in the city, in which the wealthy and their supporters were the main victims. Their houses were plundered. Allegedly, over 4,000 people were killed, purely because they belonged to the upper class. More than 6,000 people escaped from the city, even though the gates had been locked. They mostly fled to Agrigentum.

Finally, Agathocles called an assembly of the people, in which he presented himself as a saviour of democracy in the face of the oligarchs and announced that he would retire from his position and return to private life. His followers responded by calling on him to take over the leadership of the state. He responded that he was willing to be general once more, but only if he could hold the role without any colleagues, as General with unlimited power (). This was the title that the earlier ruler Dionysius I had used as the legal basis for his tyranny. The people elected him to this position and also entrusted him with a general &quot;management of the city&quot; (). After this he announced a cancellation of debts and redistribution of the land, two planks of the traditional populist programme.

===Rulership===

War with Carthage followed. In 311 BC Agathocles was defeated in the Battle of the Himera River and besieged in Syracuse. In 310 BC he made a desperate effort to break through the blockade and attack Carthage. He landed at Cape Bon in August 310 BC, and was able to defeat the Carthaginians for the first time, and establish a camp near Tunis. He then turned east and tried to take over coastal trading cities such as Neapolis and Hadrumetum, and on this occasion concluded an alliance with Ailymas, king of the Libyans according to Diodorus of Sicily, in an attempt to surround and isolate Carthage. After capturing Hadrumetum, Thapsus and other coastal towns, Agathocles turned his attention to central Tunisia. Before or during this campaign, he broke his alliance with Ailymas, whom he pursued and killed, but he kept his Numidian army, including war chariots they built.

In 309/8 BC, Agathocles began trying to sway Ophellas, ruler of Cyrenaica, as he was likely to prove a useful ally in Agathocles&#x27; war against the Carthaginians. To gain his allegiance, he promised to cede to Ophellas whatever conquests their combined forces might make in Africa, reserving to himself only the possession of Sicily. Ophellas gathered a powerful army from the homeland of his wife Euthydike (a descendant of Miltiades), Athens, where many citizens felt disgruntled after having lost their voting rights. Despite the natural obstacles that presented themselves on his route, Ophellas succeeded in reaching the Carthaginian territories after a toilsome and perilous march of more than two months. He was received by Agathocles with every demonstration of friendship, and the two armies encamped near each other, but a few days later, Agathocles betrayed his new ally by attacking the camp of the Cyrenaeans and having Ophellas killed. The Cyrenean troops, left without a leader, went over to Agathocles.
After several victories, he was finally completely defeated (307 BC) and fled secretly to Sicily. After concluding peace with Carthage in 306 BC, Agathocles styled himself king of Sicily in 304 BC, and established his rule over the Greek cities of the island more firmly than ever. A peace treaty with Carthage left him in control of Sicily east of the Halycus River. Even in his old age, he displayed the same restless energy and is said to have been contemplating a fresh attack on Carthage at the time of his death.

His last years were plagued by ill health and the turbulence of his grandson Archagathus, at whose instigation he is said to have been poisoned; according to others, he died a natural death. He was a born leader of mercenaries, and, although he did not shrink from cruelty to gain his ends, he afterwards showed himself a mild and popular &quot;tyrant&quot;. Agathocles restored the Syracusan democracy on his deathbed and did not want his sons to succeed him as king.

==Family==
Agathocles was married three times. His first wife was the widow of his patron Damas, by whom he had two sons: 
* Archagathus, who was murdered by the army in Africa in 307 BC after Agathocles abandoned it. He had one son, also called Archagathus, who was Agathocles&#x27; main general and heir in the 290s BC, but became involved in a succession dispute with his younger uncle, also called Agathocles, and was assassinated immediately after his father&#x27;s deat in 289 BC.
* Heracleides, who was murdered with his brother in Africa in 307 BC. 

Agathocles&#x27; second wife was Alcia, with whom he had two children:
* Lanassa, second wife of King Pyrrhus of Epirus and mother of Alexander II of Epirus.
* Agathocles, who was murdered in a succession dispute shortly before his father&#x27;s death. 

Agathocles&#x27; third wife was Theoxena, who was the second daughter of Berenice I and her first husband Philip and thus a stepdaughter of Ptolemy I Soter, king of Egypt. She escaped to Egypt with their two children following Agathocles&#x27; death in 289 BC:
* Archagathus and Theoxena, who escaped to Egypt in 289 BC. Their descendants included Agathocleia and Agathocles of Egypt, who were Ptolemy IV&#x27;s chief mistress and chief minister respectively, and dominated Egypt in the first years of Ptolemy V&#x27;s reign.

==Legacy==
Agathocles was cited as an example &quot;Of those who become princes through their crimes&quot; in chapter 8 of Niccolò Machiavelli&#x27;s treatise on politics - &quot;The Prince&quot; (1513).
He was described as behaving as a criminal at every stage of his career. Machiavelli claimed: 

Machiavelli goes on to reason that Agathocles&#x27; success, in contrast to other criminal tyrants, was due to his ability to commit his crimes quickly and ruthlessly, and states that cruelties are best used when they

However, he came to glory as much as he did brutality by repelling invading Carthaginians and winning the loyalty of the denizens of his land.

<text>The economy of Alberta is the sum of all economic activity in Alberta, Canada&#x27;s fourth largest province by population. Alberta&#x27;s GDP in 2018 was CDN$338.2 billion.

Although Alberta has a presence in many industries such as agriculture, forestry, education, tourism, finance, and manufacturing, the politics and culture of the province have been closely tied to the production of fossil energy since the 1940s. Alberta—with an estimated 1.4 billion cubic metres of unconventional oil resource in the bituminous oil sands—leads Canada as an oil producer.

In 2018, Alberta&#x27;s energy sector contributed over $71.5 billion to Canada&#x27;s nominal gross domestic product. According to Statistics Canada, in May 2018, the oil and gas extraction industry reached its highest proportion of Canada&#x27;s national GDP since 1985, exceeding 7% and &quot;surpass[ing] banking and insurance&quot; with extraction of non-conventional oil from the oilsands reaching an &quot;impressive&quot;, all-time high in May 2018. With conventional oil extraction &quot;climbed up to the highs from 2007&quot;, the demand for Canadian oil was strong in May.

From 1990 to 2003, Alberta&#x27;s economy grew by 57% compared to 43% for all of Canada—the strongest economic growth of any region in Canada. In 2006 Alberta&#x27;s per capita GDP was higher than all US states, and one of the highest figures in the world. In 2006, the deviation from the national average was the largest for any province in Canadian history. Alberta&#x27;s per capita GDP in 2007 was by far the highest of any province in Canada at C$74,825 (approx. US$75,000). Alberta&#x27;s per capita GDP in 2007 was 61% higher than the Canadian average of C$46,441 and more than twice that of all the Maritime provinces. From 2004 to 2014 Alberta&#x27;s &quot;exports of commodities rose 91%, reaching $121 billion in 2014&quot; and 500,000 new jobs were created. In 2014, Alberta&#x27;s real GDP by expenditure grew by 4.8%, the strongest growth rate among the provinces.&quot; In 2017, Alberta&#x27;s real per capita GDP—the economic output per person—was $71,092, compared to the Canadian average of $47,417. In 2016, Alberta&#x27;s A grade on its income per capita was based on the fact that it was almost &quot;identical&quot; to that of the &quot;top peer country&quot;—Ireland.

The energy industry provided 7.7% of all jobs in Alberta in 2013, and 140,300 jobs representing 6.1% of total employment of 2,286,900 in Alberta in 2017. The unemployment rate in Alberta peaked in November 2016 at 9.1%. Its lowest point in a ten-year period from July 2009 to July 2019, was in September 2013 at 4.3%. The unemployment rate in the spring of 2019 in Alberta was 6.7% with 21,000 jobs added in April. By July 2019, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate had increased to 7.0%.

By August 2019, the employment number in Alberta was 2,344,000, following the loss of 14,000 full-time jobs in July, which represented the &quot;largest decline&quot; in Canada according to Statistics Canada.

Beginning in June 2014, the record high volume of worldwide oil inventories in storage—referred to as a global oil glut—caused crude oil prices to collapse at near ten-year low prices. By 2016 West Texas Intermediate (WTI)—the benchmark light, sweet crude oil—reached its lowest price in ten years—US$26.55. In 2012 the price of WTI had reached US$125 and in 2014 the price was $100. By February 2016 the price of Western Canadian Select WCS—the Alberta benchmark heavy crude oil—was US$14.10—the cheapest oil in the world. Alberta boom years from 2010 to 2014 ended with a &quot;long and deep&quot; recession that began in 2014, driven by low commodity pricing ended in 2017. By 2019—five years later—Alberta was still in recovery. Overall, there were approximately 35,000 jobs lost in mining, oil and gas alone. Since 2014, sectors that offered high-wage employment of $30 and above, saw about 100,000 jobs disappear—&quot;construction (down more than 45,000 jobs), mining, oil and gas (down nearly 35,000), and professional services (down 18,000),&quot; according to the economist, Trevor Tombe. There was a decrease in wages, in the number of jobs, and in the number of hours worked. The total loss of incomes from &quot;workers, business, and government&quot; amounted to about 20 percent or about CDN$75 billion less per year. Since 2011, prices have increased in Alberta by 18%. However, a typical worker in Alberta still earns more than a typical worker in all the other provinces and territories.

By March 2016, Alberta lost over 100,000 jobs in the oil patch. In spite of the surplus with the low price of WCS in 2015—99% of Canada&#x27;s oil exports went to the United States and in 2015 Canada was still their largest exporter of total petroleum—3,789 thousand bpd in September—3,401 thousand bpd in October up from 3,026 thousand bpd in September 2014. By April 2019, two of the major oil companies, still had thousands of workers—Suncor had about 12,500 employees and Canadian Natural Resources had about 10,000 full-time employees.

Alberta has the &quot;lowest taxes overall of any province or territory&quot; in Canada, due in part to having high resource tax revenues. However, overall tax revenues from oil royalties and other non-renewable sources has fallen steeply along with the drop in global oil prices. For example, in 2013, oil tax revenues brought in 9.58 billion, or 21% of the total Provincial budget, whereas in 2018 it had fallen to just 5.43 billion, or 11% of the Provincial budget.
In the spring of 2020, Alberta&#x27;s economy suffered from the economic fallout of both the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war.&quot;

== Data ==


==Current overview==
According to ATB Financial&#x27;s Vice President and Chief Economist—Todd Hirsch, who spoke during an April 2, 2020, webinar hosted by the Calgary Chamber of Commerce, the COVID-19 pandemic in Alberta and its &quot;economic fallout will permanently reshape our economy.&quot; Hirsch said that he expects that the resulting contraction in Alberta&#x27;s economy will be the &quot;worst...Alberta has ever seen.&quot;

The global price of oil decreased dramatically because of the combination of COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war. In March 2020, the United States benchmark crude oil EWest Texas Intermediate (WTI)—upon which Alberta&#x27;s benchmark crude oil Western Canadian Select (WCS) price is based—dropped to an historical below of US$20 a barrel. The price of WCS bitumen-blend crude was US$3.82 per barrel by the end of March.
In 2018, the low price of heavy oil negatively impacted Alberta&#x27;s economic growth.

In November 2018, the price of Western Canadian Select (WCS), the benchmark for Canadian heavy crude, hit its record low of less than US$14 a barrel, as a &quot;surge of production met limited pipeline space causing bottlenecks.&quot; Previously, from 2008 through 2018, WCS had sold at an average discount of US$17 against West Texas Intermediate (WTI)—the U.S. crude oil benchmark, but by the fall of 2018, the differential between WCS and WTI reached a record of over US$50 per barrel. In response, then Premier Rachel Notley made a December 2 announcement of a mandatory cut of 8.7% in Alberta&#x27;s oil production. By December 12, after the announcement of the government&#x27;s &quot;mandated oil output curtailment&quot;, the price of WCS rose c. 70% to c. US$41 a barrel with the WTI differential falling from US50 to c. US$11., according to the &quot;Financial Post&quot;. The WCS price rose to US$28.60 by January 2019, as the international price of oil had begun to recover from the December &quot;sharp downturn&quot; caused by the ongoing China–U.S. trade war In March 2019, the differential of WTI over WCS decreased to $US9.94 as the price of WTI dropped to US$58.15 a barrel, which is 7.5% lower than it was in March 2018, while the price of WCS increased to US$48.21 a barrel which is 35.7% higher than in March 2018. According to TD Economics&#x27; September 2019 report, the government&#x27;s &quot;mandated oil output curtailment&quot;, has resulted in a sustained rebound in WCS prices. However, investment and spending were low in the province. The loss of 14, 000 of the full-time jobs out of 2,344,000 in Alberta in July 2019, represented the &quot;largest decline&quot; in employment in Canada for that month, according to Statistics Canada.

In 1985, Alberta&#x27;s energy industry accounted for 36.1% of the provinces $66.8 billion GDP. In 2006, the mining, oil and gas extraction industry accounted for 29.1% of GDP; by 2012 it was 23.3%; in 2013, it was 24.6% of Alberta&#x27;s $331.9 billion GDP, and in 2016, the mining, oil and gas extraction industry accounted for about 27.9% of Alberta&#x27;s GDP.

By comparison, &quot;In 2017, the federal, provincial and territorial governments spent some $724 billion on programs and more than $58 billion on interest payments on their public debt, which, combined, amounted to about 36 percent of Canada’s gross domestic product (GDP). Their combined borrowing that year was $27 billion, and their net financial debt at year-end stood at around $1.2 trillion, about 54 percent of GDP.&quot;

In his July 2019 &quot;CBC News&quot; article, economist Trevor Tombe said that prior to the 2014 recession, Albertans had experienced boom years from 2010 to 2014, with workers earnings reaching exceptional highs. The recession, which &quot;ended over two years ago&quot; in 2017, was &quot;long and deep&quot;. By 2019—five years later—the province was still in recovery. Overall, there were approximately 35,000 jobs lost in mining, oil and gas alone. By 2019, the slow recovery and low earnings growth have resulted in workers getting &quot;fewer hours, fewer jobs and, in some cases, lower wages&quot;. Tombe said that from 2014 to 2016, Alberta earned CDN$75 billion less per year with the &quot;total incomes of workers, business, and government combined [falling] by nearly 20 per cent&quot;. Tombes said that relative to Alberta&#x27;s &quot;growth path prior to the recession&quot; Alberta&#x27;s economy is &quot;down $100 billion per year&quot;, compared to what was anticipated. Tombes said that the &quot;boom years that ended in 2014 were the outliers&quot; and the lower earnings in 2019 reflect a &quot;natural adjustment that&#x27;s moving Alberta to a more normal and balanced labour market.&quot; While earnings are lower, because of inflation, prices have increased in Alberta by 18% since 2011. &quot;The $1,183 per week a typical worker earns today goes about as far as $1,000 did nearly a decade ago.&quot;, according to Tombe. In spite of the typical worker in Alberta earns $1,183 per week compared to Saskatchewan, where the typical worker earns $1,070 per week. The weekly income a typical worker in all the other Canadian provinces and territories is less than that.

Since 2014, sectors that offered high-wage employment of $30 and above, saw about 100,000 jobs disappear—&quot;construction (down more than 45,000 jobs), mining, oil and gas (down nearly 35,000), and professional services (down 18,000).&quot;

==Alberta&#x27;s deficit==
Alberta&#x27;s net debt was $27.5 billion by March 2019, which represents the end of the 2018-19 fiscal year (FY). By November 2018, Alberta&#x27;s government expenditures were $55 billion while the revenue was about $48 billion, according to a report by the University of Calgary&#x27;s School of Public Policy (SPP) economist, Trevor Tombe. Capital investment amounted to $4.3 billion. The provincial government employs more than &quot;210,000 full-time equivalent workers across hundreds of departments, boards and other entities.&quot; Tombe, cited a $8.3 billion deficit in his November report, prior to the release in February 2019 of the corrected deficit figures, which was &quot;$1.9 billion less in 2018-19 than originally expected&quot;, —$6.9-billion deficit instead of the original $8.8-billion&quot;.

Alberta&#x27;s current deficit is &quot;unusual for the province&quot;, says Tombe in 2018. During the financial crisis, Alberta&#x27;s &quot;net asset position equivalent to 15 per cent of GDP&quot;−it &quot;owned more financial assets than it owed in debt.&quot;

In 2009 Alberta had $31.7 billion in financial assets.

==Alberta&#x27;s credit rating==
On December 3, 2019, Moody&#x27;s downgraded Alberta&#x27;s credit rating from Aa2 stable from Aa1 negative and &quot;downgraded the long-term debt ratings of the Alberta Capital Finance Authority and the long-term issuer rating of ATB Financial to Aa2 from Aa1.&quot; The agency said that there is a &quot;structural weakness in the provincial economy that remains concentrated and dependent on non-renewable resources ... and remains pressured by a lack of sufficient pipeline capacity to transport oil efficiently with no near-term expectation of a significant rebound in oil-related investments...Alberta&#x27;s oil and gas sector is carbon-intensive and Alberta&#x27;s greenhouse gas emissions are the highest among provinces. Alberta is also susceptible to natural disasters including wildfires and floods which could lead to significant mitigation costs by the province.&quot;

==Alberta&#x27;s real per capita GDP==
In 2006 Alberta&#x27;s per capita GDP was higher than all US states, and one of the highest figures in the world. In 2006, the deviation from the national average was the largest for any province in Canadian history. In 2007, Alberta&#x27;s per capita GDP in 2007 was C$74,825 (approx. US$75,000)—by far the highest of any Canadian province—61% higher than the Canadian average of C$46,441 and more than twice that of all the Maritime provinces. In 2017, Alberta&#x27;s real per capita GDP—the economic output per person—was $71,092, compared to the Canadian average of $47,417. Alberta&#x27;s A grade on its income per capita was based on the fact that it was almost &quot;identical&quot; to that of the &quot;top peer country&quot; in 2016, Ireland.

In 2017, Alberta&#x27;s real per capita GDP—the economic output per person—was $71,092 compared to the Canadian average output per person of $47, 417 and Prince Edward Island at $32,123 per person. Since at least 1997, Alberta&#x27;s per capita GDP has been higher than that of any other province. In 2014, Alberta&#x27;s reached its highest gap ever—$30,069—between its real capita GDP and the Canadian average.

According to the Conference Board of Canada, in 2016 Alberta earned an &quot;A grade with income per capita almost identical to the top peer country, Ireland.&quot; In 2016 income per capita in Alberta was $59,259.

==Economic geography==

Alberta has a small internal market, and it is relatively distant from major world markets, despite good transportation links to the rest of Canada and to the United States to the south. Alberta is located in the northwestern quadrant of North America, in a region of low population density called the Interior Plains. Alberta is landlocked, and separated by a series of mountain ranges from the nearest outlets to the Pacific Ocean, and by the Canadian Shield from ports on the Lakehead or Hudson Bay. From these ports to major populations centres and markets in Europe or Asia is several thousands of kilometers. The largest population clusters of North America (the Boston – Washington, San Francisco - San Diego, Chicago – Pittsburgh, and Quebec City – Windsor Corridors) are all thousands of kilometers away from Alberta. Partly for this reason, Alberta has never developed a large presence in the industries that have traditionally started industrialization in other places (notably the original Industrial Revolution in Great Britain) but which require large labour forces, and large internal markets or easy transportation to export markets, namely textiles, metallurgy, or transportation-related manufacturing (automotives, ships, or train cars).

Agriculture has been a key industry since the 1870s. The climate is dry, temperate, and continental, with extreme variations between seasons. Productive soils are found in most of the southern half of the province (excluding the mountains), and in certain parts of the north. Agriculture on a large scale is practiced further north in Alberta than anywhere else in North America, extending into the Peace River country above the 55th parallel north. Generally, however, northern Alberta (and areas along the Alberta Rockies) is forested land and logging is more important than agriculture there. Agriculture is divided into primarily field crops in the east, livestock in the west, and a mixture in between and in the parkland belt in the near north.

Conventional oil and gas fields are found throughout the province on an axis running from the northwest to the southeast. Oil sands are found in the northeast, especially around Fort McMurray (the Athabasca Oil Sands).

Because of its (relatively) economically isolated location, Alberta relies heavily on transportation links with the rest of the world. Alberta&#x27;s historical development has been largely influenced by the development of new transportation infrastructure, (see &quot;trends&quot; below). Alberta is now served by two major transcontinental railways (CN and CP), by three major highway connections to the Pacific (the Trans-Canada via Kicking Horse Pass, the Yellowhead via Yellowhead Pass and the Crowsnest via Crowsnest Pass), and one to the United States (Interstate 15), as well as two international airports (Calgary and Edmonton). Also, Alberta is connected to the TransCanada pipeline system (natural gas) to Eastern Canada, the Northern Border Pipeline (gas), Alliance Pipeline (gas) and Enbridge Pipeline System (oil) to the Eastern United States, the Gas Transmission Northwest and Northwest Pipeline (gas) to the Western United States, and the McNeill HVDC Back-to-back station (electric power) to Saskatchewan.

=== Economic regions and cities ===
Since the days of early agricultural settlement, the majority of Alberta&#x27;s population has been concentrated in the parkland belt (mixed forest-grassland), a boomerang-shaped strip of land extending along the North Saskatchewan River from Lloydminster to Edmonton and then along the Rocky Mountain foothills south to Calgary. This area is slightly more humid and treed than the drier prairie (grassland) region called Palliser&#x27;s Triangle to its south, and large areas of the south (the &quot;Special Areas&quot;) were depopulated during the droughts of the 1920s and 30s. The chernozem (black soil) of the parkland region is more agriculturally productive than the red and grey soils to the south. Urban development has also been most advanced in the parkland belt. Edmonton and Red Deer are parkland cities, while Calgary is on the parkland-prairie fringe. Lethbridge and Medicine Hat are prairie cities. Grande Prairie lies in the Peace River Country a parkland region (with isolated patches of prairie, hence the name) in the northwest isolated from the rest of the parkland by the forested Swan Hills. Fort McMurray is the only urbanized population centre in the boreal forest which covers much of the northern half of the province.

==== Calgary and Edmonton ====
The Calgary and Edmonton regions, by far the province&#x27;s two largest metropolitan regions, account for the majority of the province&#x27;s population. They are relatively close to each other by the standards of Western Canada and distant from other metropolitan regions such as Vancouver or Winnipeg. This has produced a history of political and economic rivalry and comparison but also economic integration that has created an urbanized corridor between the two cities.

The economic profile of the two regions is slightly different. Both cities are mature service economies built on a base of resource extraction in their hinterlands. However, Calgary is predominant in hosting the regional and national headquarters of oil and gas exploration and drilling companies. Edmonton skews much more towards governments, universities and hospitals as large employers, while Edmonton&#x27;s suburban fringes (e.g. Fort Saskatchewan, Nisku, Strathcona County (Refinery Row), Leduc, Beaumont, Acheson) are home to most of the province&#x27;s manufacturing (much of it related to oil and gas).

===== Calgary-Edmonton Corridor =====
The Calgary-Edmonton Corridor is the most urbanized region in the province and one of the densest in Canada. Measured from north to south, the region covers a distance of roughly . In 2001, the population of the Calgary-Edmonton Corridor was 2.15 million (72% of Alberta&#x27;s population). It is also one of the fastest-growing regions in the country. A 2003 study by TD Bank Financial Group found the corridor was the only Canadian urban centre to amass a U.S. level of wealth while maintaining a Canadian-style quality of life, offering universal health care benefits. The study found GDP per capita in the corridor was 10% above average U.S. metropolitan areas and 40% above other Canadian cities at that time.

===== Calgary–Edmonton rivalry =====

Seeing Calgary and Edmonton as part of a single economic region as the TD study did in 2003 was novel. The more traditional view had been to see the two cities as economic rivals. For example, in the 1980 both cities claimed to be the &quot;Oil Capital of Canada&quot;.

==Background==

Alberta has always been an export-oriented economy. In line with Harold Innis&#x27; &quot;Staples Thesis&quot;, the economy has changed substantially as different export commodities have risen or fallen in importance. In sequence, the most important products have been: fur, wheat and beef, and oil and gas.

The development of transportation in Alberta has been crucial to its historical economic development. The North American fur trade relied on birch-bark canoes, York boats, and Red River carts on age-old Native trails and buffalo trails to move furs out of, and European trade goods into, the region. Immigration into the province was eased tremendously by the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway&#x27;s transcontinental line across southern Alberta in 1880s. Commercial farming became viable in the area once the grain trade had developed technologies to handle the bulk export of grain, especially hopper cars and grain elevators. Oil and gas exports have been possible because of increasing pipeline technology.

Prior to the 1950s, Alberta was a primarily agricultural economy, based on the export of wheat, beef, and a few other agricultural products. The health of economy was closely bound up with the price of wheat.

In 1947 a major oil field was discovered near Edmonton. It was not the first petroleum find in Alberta, but it was large and spawned an industry that significantly altered the economy of the province (and coincided with growing American demand for energy). Since that time, Alberta&#x27;s economic fortunes have largely tracked the price of oil, and increasingly natural gas prices. When oil prices spiked during the 1967 Oil Embargo, 1973 oil crisis, and 1979 energy crisis, Alberta&#x27;s economy boomed. However, during the 1980s oil glut Alberta&#x27;s economy suffered. Alberta boomed once again during the 2003-2008 oil price spike. In July 2008 the price of oil peaked and began to decline, and Alberta&#x27;s economy soon followed suit, with unemployment doubling within a year. By 2009 with natural gas prices at a long-term low, Alberta&#x27;s economy was in poor health compared to before, although still relatively better than many other comparable jurisdictions. By 2012 natural gas prices were at a ten-year low and the Canadian dollar was highly-valued compared to the U.S. dollar, but then oil prices recovered until June 2014.

The spin-offs from petroleum allowed Alberta to develop many other industries. Oilpatch-related manufacturing is an obvious example, but financial services and government services have also benefited from oil money.

A comparison of the development of Alberta&#x27;s less oil and gas-endowed neighbours, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, reveals the role petroleum has played. Alberta was the least-populous of the three Prairie Provinces in the early 20th century, but by 2009, Alberta&#x27;s population was 3,632,483, approximately three times as much as either Saskatchewan (1,023,810) or Manitoba (1,213,815).

==Employment==
Alberta&#x27;s economy is a highly developed one in which most people work in services such as healthcare, government, or retail. Primary industries are also of great importance, however.

By March 2016 the unemployment rate in Alberta rose to 7.9%— its &quot;highest level since April 1995 and the first time the province’s rate has surpassed the national average since December 1988.&quot; There were 21,200 fewer jobs than February 2015. The unemployment rate was expected to average 7.4% in 2016. The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) claimed that Alberta lost 35,000 jobs in 2015–25,000 from the oil services sector and 10,000 from exploration and production. Full-time employment increased by 10,000 in February 2016 after falling 20,000 in both December 2015 and January 2016. The natural resources industry lost 7,400 jobs in February. &quot;Year-over-year (y/y), the goods sector lost 56,000 jobs, while the services sector gained 34,800.&quot; In 2015 Alberta&#x27;s population increased by 3,900. While Alberta had a reprieve in job loss in February 2016—up 1,400 jobs after losing jobs in October, November, December 2015 and January 2016—Ontario lost 11,200 jobs, Saskatchewan lost 7,800 jobs and New Brunswick lost 5,700 jobs.

The unemployment rate in spring 2019 in Alberta was 6.7% with 21,000 jobs added in April; in Calgary it was 7.4%, in Edmonton it was 6.9%, in Northern Alberta it was 11.2%, and in Southern Alberta it was 7.8%. By July 2019, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate had increased to 7.0%, which represented an increase of 0.3% from the previous year. The unemployment rate in Alberta peaked in November 2016 at 9.1%. Its lowest point in a ten-year period from July 2009 to July 2019 was in September 2013 at 4.3%.

By August 2019, the employment number in Alberta was 2,344,000, following the loss of 14,000 full-time jobs in July, which represented that the &quot;largest decline&quot; in Canada according to Statistics Canada.

Employment by industry, Alberta – seasonally adjusted (000s)
===Extraction industries===
According to the Government of Alberta, the &quot;mining and oil and gas extraction industry accounted for 6.1% of total employment in Alberta in 2017&quot;. By April 2019, there were about 145,100 people working directly with the oil and gas industry. In 2013, there were 171,200 people employed in the mining and oil and gas extraction industry.

In 2007 there were 146,900 people working in the mining and oil and gas extraction industry. 
* Oil and Gas Extraction industry = 69,900
* Support Activities for Mining &amp; Oil &amp; Gas Extraction (primarily oil and gas exploration and drilling) = 71,700
* Mining other than oil and gas (mainly coal and mineral mining &amp; quarrying) = 5,100

===Largest employers of Alberta===
According to &quot;Alberta Venture&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 50 largest employers in the province, the largest employers are:
==Sectors==

===Oil and gas extraction industries===

In 2018, Alberta&#x27;s energy sector contributed over $71.5 billion to Canada&#x27;s nominal gross domestic product. In 2006, it accounted for 29.1% of Alberta&#x27;s GDP; by 2012 it was 23.3%; in 2013, it was 24.6%, and in 2016 it was 27.9%. According to Statistics Canada, in May 2018, the oil and gas extraction industry reached its highest proportion of Canada&#x27;s national GDP since 1985, exceeding 7% and &quot;surpass[ing] banking and insurance&quot;. with extraction of non-conventional oil from the oilsands reaching an &quot;impressive&quot;, all-time high in May 2018. With conventional oil extraction &quot;climbed up to the highs from 2007&quot;, the demand for Canadian oil was strong in May.

Alberta is the largest producer of conventional crude oil, synthetic crude, natural gas and gas products in the country. Alberta is the world&#x27;s 2nd largest exporter of natural gas and the 4th largest producer. Two of the largest producers of petrochemicals in North America are located in central and north central Alberta. In both Red Deer and Edmonton, world class polyethylene and vinyl manufacturers produce products shipped all over the world, and Edmonton&#x27;s oil refineries provide the raw materials for a large petrochemical industry to the east of Edmonton. Since the early 1940s, Alberta had supplied oil and gas to the rest of Canada and the United States. The Athabasca River region produces oil for internal and external use. The Athabasca Oil Sands contain the largest proven reserves of oil in the world outside Saudi Arabia.

The Athabasca Oil Sands (sometimes known as the Athabasca Tar sands) have estimated unconventional oil reserves approximately equal to the conventional oil reserves of the rest of the world, estimated to be . With the development of new extraction methods such as steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD), which was developed in Alberta, bitumen and synthetic crude oil can be produced at costs close to those of conventional crude. Many companies employ both conventional strip mining and non-conventional in situ methods to extract the bitumen from the oil sands. With current technology and at current prices, about of bitumen are recoverable. Fort McMurray, one of Canada&#x27;s fastest growing cities, has grown enormously in recent years because of the large corporations which have taken on the task of oil production. As of late 2006 there were over $100 billion in oil sands projects under construction or in the planning stages in northeastern Alberta.

Another factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the oil sands was the price of oil. The oil price increases since 2003 made it more than profitable to extract this oil, which in the past would give little profit or even a loss.

Alberta&#x27;s economy was negatively impacted by the 2015-2016 oil glut with a record high volume of worldwide oil inventories in storage, with global crude oil collapsing at near ten-year low prices. The United States doubled its 2008 production levels mainly due to substantial improvements in shale &quot;fracking&quot; technology, OPEC members consistently exceeded their production ceiling, and China experienced a marked slowdown in economic growth and crude oil imports.

====Natural gas====
Natural gas has been found at several points, and in 1999, the production of natural gas liquids (ethane, propane, and butanes) totalled , valued at $2.27 billion. Alberta also provides 13% of all the natural gas used in the United States.

Notable gas reserves were discovered in the 1883 near Medicine Hat. The town of Medicine Hat began using gas for lighting the town, and supplying light and fuel for the people, and a number of industries using the gas for manufacturing.

One of North America&#x27;s benchmarks is Alberta gas-trading price—the AECO &quot;C&quot; spot price.

In 2018, 69% of the marketable natural gas in Canada was produced in Alberta. Forty nine per cent of Alberta&#x27;s natural gas production is consumed in Alberta. In Alberta, the average household uses of natural gas annually. Domestic demand for natural gas is divided across sectors, with the highest demand—83% coming from &quot;industrial, electrical generation, transportation and other sectors,&quot; and 17 percent going towards residential and commercial sectors. 
Of the provinces, Alberta is the largest consumer of natural gas at 3.9 billion cubic feet per day.

By August 2019, the &quot;Financial Post&quot; said that &quot;AECO daily and monthly natural gas prices&quot; were at the lowest they have been since 1992. Canada&#x27;s largest natural gas producer, Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., announced in early August that it had &quot;shut in gas production of 27,000 million cubic feet per day because of depressed prices. Previously natural gas pipeline drilled in the southern Alberta and shipped to markets in Eastern Canada. By 2019, the entire natural gas industry had was primarily operating in northwestern Alberta and northeastern B.C., which resulted in strained infrastructure. New systems will not be complete until 2021 or 2023. In September 25, 2017 Alberta&#x27;s benchmark AECO natural gas prices fell into &quot;negative territory – &quot;meaning producers have had to pay customers to take their gas&quot;. It happened again in early October with the price per gigajoule dropping to -7 cents. TransCanada (now TC Energy Corp)—which &quot;owns and operates Alberta&#x27;s &quot;largest natural gas gathering and transmission system, interrupted its pipeline service in the fall of 2017 to complete field maintenance on the Alberta system. In July 2018, RS Energy Group&#x27;s energy analyst Samir Kayande, said that faced with a glut of natural gas across North America, the continental market price was $3 per gigajoule. Alberta is &quot;awash&quot; with natural gas but faces pipeline bottlenecks. CEOs of nine Alberta natural gas producers requested the Kenney government to mandate production cuts to deal with the crisis. On June 30, the AECO price of gas dropped to 11 cents per gigajoule, because of maintenance issues with the pipeline giant TC Energy Corp.

In 2003 Alberta produced of marketable natural gas. That year, 62% of Alberta&#x27;s natural gas was shipped to the United States, 24% was used within Alberta, and 14% was used in the rest of Canada. In 2006, Alberta consumed of natural gas. The rest was exported across Canada and to the United States. Royalties to Alberta from natural gas and its byproducts are larger than royalties from crude oil and bitumen. In 2006, there were 13,473 successful natural gas wells drilled in Alberta: 12,029 conventional gas wells and 1,444 coalbed methane wells. There may be up to of coalbed methane in Alberta, although it is unknown how much of this gas might be recoverable. Alberta has one of the most extensive natural gas systems in the world as part of its energy infrastructure, with of energy related pipelines.

===Coal===
Coal has been mined in Alberta since the late 19th century. Over 1800 mines have operated in Alberta since then.

The coal industry was vital to the early development of several communities, especially those in the foothills and along deep river valleys where coal was close to the surface.

Alberta is still a major coal producer, every two weeks Alberta produces enough coal to fill the Sky Dome in Toronto.

Much of that coal is burned in Alberta for electricity generation. By 2008, Alberta used over 25 million tonnes of coal annually to generate electricity. However, Alberta is set to retire coal power by 2023, ahead of 2030 provincial deadline.

Alberta has vast coal resources and 70 per cent of Canada&#x27;s coal reserves are located in Alberta. This amounts to 33.6 Gigatonnes.

Vast beds of coal are found extending for hundreds of miles, a short distance below the surface of the plains. The coal belongs to the Cretaceous beds, and while not so heavy as that of the Coal Measures in England is of excellent quality. In the valley of the Bow River, alongside the Canadian Pacific Railway, valuable beds of anthracite coal are still worked. The usual coal deposits of the area of bituminous or semi-bituminous coal. These are largely worked at Lethbridge in southern Alberta and Edmonton in the centre of the province. Many other parts of the province have pits for private use.

===Electricity===
, Alberta&#x27;s generating capacity was 16,261 MW, and Alberta has about of transmission lines.

Alberta has 1491 megawatts of wind power capacity.

Production of electricity in Alberta in 2016 by source:
Alberta has added 9,000 MW of new supply since 1998.

Peak for power use in one day was set on July 9, 2015 – 10,520 MW.

===Mineral mining===
Building stones mined in Alberta include Rundle stone, and Paskapoo sandstone.

Diamonds were first found in Alberta in 1958, and many stones have been found since, although to date no large-scale mines have been developed.

===Manufacturing===
The Edmonton area, and in particular Nisku is a major centre for manufacturing oil and gas related equipment. As well Edmonton&#x27;s Refinery Row is home to a petrochemical industry.

According to a 2016 Statistics Canada report Alberta&#x27;s manufacturing sales year-over-year sales fell 13.2 per cent, with a loss of almost four per cent from December to January. Alberta&#x27;s economy continued to shrink because of the collapse of the oil and gas sector. The petroleum and coal product manufacturing industry is now third— behind food and chemicals.

===Biotechnology===
Several companies and services in the biotech sector are clustered around the University of Alberta, for example ColdFX.

===Food processing===
Owing to the strength of agriculture, food processing was once a major part of the economies of Edmonton and Calgary, but this sector has increasingly moved to smaller centres such as Brooks, the home of XL Foods, responsible for one third of Canada&#x27;s beef processing in 2011.

===Transportation===

Edmonton is a major distribution centre for northern communities, hence the nickname &quot;Gateway to the North&quot;. Edmonton is one of CN Rail&#x27;s most important hubs. Since 1996, Canadian Pacific Railway has its headquarters in downtown Calgary.

WestJet, Canada&#x27;s second largest air carrier, is headquartered in Calgary, by Calgary International Airport, which serves as the airline&#x27;s primary hub. Prior to its dissolution, Canadian Airlines was headquartered in Calgary by the airport. Prior to its dissolution, Air Canada subsidiary Zip was headquartered in Calgary.

===Agriculture and forestry===
==== Agriculture ====

In the past, cattle, horses, and sheep were reared in the southern prairie region on ranches or smaller holdings. Currently Alberta produces cattle valued at over $3.3 billion, as well as other livestock in lesser quantities. In this region irrigation is widely used. Wheat, accounting for almost half of the $2 billion agricultural economy, is supplemented by canola, barley, rye, sugar beets, and other mixed farming. In 2011, Alberta producers seeded an estimated total of to spring wheat, durum, barley, oats, mixed grains, triticale, canola and dry peas. Of the total seeded area, 94 per cent was harvested as grains and oilseeds and six per cent as greenfeed and silage. Saudi Arabia is a major export target especially for wheat and processed potato products. SA having decided to phase out their own forage and cereal production, Alberta expects this to be an opportunity to fill livestock feed demand in the kingdom.

Agriculture has a significant position in the province&#x27;s economy. Over three million cattle are residents of the province at one time or another, and Albertan beef has a healthy worldwide market. Although beef could also be a major export to Saudi Arabia, as with wheat and potatoes above, market access is lacking at the moment. Nearly one half of all Canadian beef is produced in Alberta. Alberta is one of the prime producers of plains buffalo (bison) for the consumer market. Sheep for wool and lamb are also raised.

Wheat and canola are primary farm crops, with Alberta leading the provinces in spring wheat production, with other grains also prominent. Much of the farming is dryland farming, often with fallow seasons interspersed with cultivation. Continuous cropping (in which there is no fallow season) is gradually becoming a more common mode of production because of increased profits and a reduction of soil erosion. Across the province, the once common grain elevator is slowly being lost as rail lines are decreased and farmers now truck the grain to central points.

Clubroot (&quot;Plasmodiophora brassicae&quot;) is a costly disease of &quot;Brassicaceae&quot; here including canola. In several experiments by Peng &quot;et al.&quot;, out of fungicides, biofungicides, inoculation with beneficial microbes, cultivar resistance, and crop rotation, only genetic resistance combined with more than two years rotation worked &quot;susceptible&quot; cultivars rotated with other crops did not produce enough improvement.

Alberta is the leading beekeeping province of Canada, with some beekeepers wintering hives indoors in specially designed barns in southern Alberta, then migrating north during the summer into the Peace River valley where the season is short but the working days are long for honeybees to produce honey from clover and fireweed. Hybrid canola also requires bee pollination, and some beekeepers service this need.

==== Forestry ====
The vast northern forest reserves of softwood allow Alberta to produce large quantities of lumber, oriented strand board (OSB) and plywood, and several plants in northern Alberta supply North America and the Pacific Rim nations with bleached wood pulp and newsprint.

In 1999, lumber products from Alberta were valued at $4.1 billion of which 72% were exported around the world. Since forests cover approximately 59% of the province&#x27;s land area, the government allows about to be harvested annually from the forests on public lands.

===Services===
Despite the high profile of the extractive industries, Alberta has a mature economy and most people work in services. In 2014 there were 1,635.8 thousand people employed in the services-producing sector. Since then, the number has steadily increased to 1754.8 thousand jobs by August 2019, which is an increase of 16.7 thousand jobs from August 2018 This includes wholesale and retail trade; transportation and warehousing; finance, insurance, real estate, rental and leasing; professional, scientific and technical services; business, building and other support services; educational services; health care and social assistance; information, culture and recreation; accommodation and food services; other services (except public administration) and public administration.

====Finance====
The TSX Venture Exchange is headquartered in Calgary. The city has the second highest number of corporate head offices in Canada after Toronto, and the financial services industry in Calgary has developed to support them. All major banks including the Big Five maintain corporate offices in Calgary, along with smaller banks such as Equitable Group. Recently there has also been a number of fintech companies founded in Calgary such as the National Digital Asset Exchange and Neo Financial, founded by the Skip-the-Dishes team.

One of Canada&#x27;s largest accounting firms, MNP LLP, is also headquartered in Calgary.

Edmonton hosts the headquarters of the only major Canadian banks west of Toronto: Canadian Western Bank, and ATB Financial, as well as the only province-wide credit union, Servus Credit Union.

====Government====
Despite Alberta&#x27;s reputation as a &quot;small government&quot; province, many health care and education professionals are lured to Alberta from other provinces by the higher wages the Alberta government is able to offer because of oil revenues. In 2014 the median household income in Alberta was $100,000 with the average weekly wage at $1,163—23 per cent higher than the Canadian national average.

In their May 2018 report co-authored by C. D. Howe Institute&#x27;s President and CEO, William B.P. Robson, evaluating &quot;the budgets, estimates and public accounts&quot; of 2017/18 fiscal year that were tabled by senior governments in the Canadian provinces and the federal government in terms of reporting financial information, appropriately, with transparency, and in a timely fashion, Alberta and New Brunswick ranked highest. The report also said that, prior to 2016, Alberta had scored poorly in comparison with other provinces, because of &quot;confusing array of &quot;operating,&quot; &quot;saving&quot; and &quot;capital&quot; accounts that were not Public Sector Accounting Standards (PSAS) consistent.&quot; but since 2016, Alberta has received A-plus grades. The report said that Alberta and New Brunswick in FY2017 provided &quot;straightforward reconciliations of results with budget intentions, their auditors record no reservations, and their budgets and public accounts are timely.&quot;

===Technology===
Alberta has a burgeoning high tech sector, including prominent technology companies iStockPhoto, Shareworks, Benevity, and Attabotics in Calgary, and Bioware and AltaML in Edmonton. Growth in Calgary&#x27;s technology sector, particularly at Benevity, fueled predictions of a modest economic recovery in February 2020.

<doc id="1842" wikidata="Q8814" url="?curid=1842" title="Augustin-Louis Cauchy">
<text>Baron Augustin-Louis Cauchy ( , , ; ; 21 August 1789 – 23 May 1857) was a French mathematician, engineer, and physicist. He was one of the first to rigorously state and prove the key theorems of calculus (thereby creating real analysis), pioneered the field complex analysis, and the study of permutation groups in abstract algebra. Cauchy also contributed to a number of topics in mathematical physics, notably continuum mechanics.

A profound mathematician, Cauchy had a great influence over his contemporaries and successors; Hans Freudenthal stated:
: &quot;More concepts and theorems have been named for Cauchy than for any other mathematician (in elasticity alone there are sixteen concepts and theorems named for Cauchy).&quot;

Cauchy was a prolific worker; he wrote approximately eight hundred research articles and five complete textbooks on a variety of topics in the fields of mathematics and mathematical physics.

==Biography==

===Youth and education===
Cauchy was the son of Louis François Cauchy (1760–1848) and Marie-Madeleine Desestre. Cauchy had two brothers: Alexandre Laurent Cauchy (1792–1857), who became a president of a division of the court of appeal in 1847 and a judge of the court of cassation in 1849, and Eugene François Cauchy (1802–1877), a publicist who also wrote several mathematical works. From his childhood he was good at math.

Cauchy married Aloise de Bure in 1818. She was a close relative of the publisher who published most of Cauchy&#x27;s works. They had two daughters, Marie Françoise Alicia (1819) and Marie Mathilde (1823).

Cauchy&#x27;s father was a highly ranked official in the Parisian police of the 
Ancien Régime, but lost this position due to the French Revolution (14 July 1789), which broke out one month before Augustin-Louis was born. The Cauchy family survived the revolution and the following Reign of Terror during 1793–94 by escaping to Arcueil, where Cauchy received his first education, from his father. After the execution of Robespierre in 1794, it was safe for the family to return to Paris. There, Louis-François Cauchy found a bureaucratic job in 1800, and quickly advanced his career. When Napoleon came to power in 1799, Louis-François Cauchy was further promoted, and became Secretary-General of the Senate, working directly under Laplace (who is now better known for his work on mathematical physics). The mathematician Lagrange was also a friend of the Cauchy family.

On Lagrange&#x27;s advice, Augustin-Louis was enrolled in the École Centrale du Panthéon, the best secondary school of Paris at that time, in the fall of 1802. Most of the curriculum consisted of classical languages; the ambitious Cauchy, being a brilliant student, won many prizes in Latin and the humanities. In spite of these successes, Cauchy chose an engineering career, and prepared himself for the entrance examination to the École Polytechnique.

In 1805, he placed second of 293 applicants on this exam and was admitted. One of the main purposes of this school was to give future civil and military engineers a high-level scientific and mathematical education. The school functioned under military discipline, which caused Cauchy some problems in adapting. Nevertheless, he completed the course in 1807, at age 18, and went on to the École des Ponts et Chaussées (School for Bridges and Roads). He graduated in civil engineering, with the highest honors.

===Engineering days===
After finishing school in 1810, Cauchy accepted a job as a junior engineer in Cherbourg, where Napoleon intended to build a naval base. Here Cauchy stayed for three years, and was assigned the Ourcq Canal project and the Saint-Cloud Bridge project, and worked at the Harbor of Cherbourg. Although he had an extremely busy managerial job, he still found time to prepare three mathematical manuscripts, which he submitted to the &quot;Première Classe&quot; (First Class) of the Institut de France. Cauchy&#x27;s first two manuscripts (on polyhedra) were accepted; the third one (on directrices of conic sections) was rejected.

In September 1812, at 23 years old, Cauchy returned to Paris after becoming ill from overwork. Another reason for his return to the capital was that he was losing interest in his engineering job, being more and more attracted to the abstract beauty of mathematics; in Paris, he would have a much better chance to find a mathematics related position. When his health improved in 1813, Cauchy chose not to return to Cherbourg. Although he formally kept his engineering position, he was transferred from the payroll of the Ministry of the Marine to the Ministry of the Interior. The next three years Cauchy was mainly on unpaid sick leave; he spent his time fruitfully, working on mathematics (on the related topics of symmetric functions, the symmetric group and the theory of higher-order algebraic equations). He attempted admission to the First Class of the Institut de France but failed on three different occasions between 1813 and 1815. In 1815 Napoleon was defeated at Waterloo, and the newly installed king Louis XVIII took the restoration in hand. The Académie des Sciences was re-established in March 1816; Lazare Carnot and Gaspard Monge were removed from this academy for political reasons, and the king appointed Cauchy to take the place of one of them. The reaction of Cauchy&#x27;s peers was harsh; they considered the acceptance of his membership in the academy an outrage, and Cauchy created many enemies in scientific circles.

===Professor at École Polytechnique===
In November 1815, Louis Poinsot, who was an associate professor at the École Polytechnique, asked to be exempted from his teaching duties for health reasons. Cauchy was by then a rising mathematical star. One of his great successes at that time was the proof of Fermat&#x27;s polygonal number theorem. He quit his engineering job, and received a one-year contract for teaching mathematics to second-year students of the École Polytechnique. In 1816, this Bonapartist, non-religious school was reorganized, and several liberal professors were fired; Cauchy was promoted to full professor.

When Cauchy was 28 years old, he was still living with his parents. His father found it time for his son to marry; he found him a suitable bride, Aloïse de Bure, five years his junior. The de Bure family were printers and booksellers, and published most of Cauchy&#x27;s works. Aloïse and Augustin were married on April 4, 1818, with great Roman Catholic ceremony, in the Church of Saint-Sulpice. In 1819 the couple&#x27;s first daughter, Marie Françoise Alicia, was born, and in 1823 the second and last daughter, Marie Mathilde.

The conservative political climate that lasted until 1830 suited Cauchy perfectly. In 1824 Louis XVIII died, and was succeeded by his even more conservative brother Charles X. During these years Cauchy was highly productive, and published one important mathematical treatise after another. He received cross-appointments at the Collège de France, and the .

===In exile===
In July 1830, the July Revolution occurred in France. Charles X fled the country, and was succeeded by Louis-Philippe. Riots, in which uniformed students of the École Polytechnique took an active part, raged close to Cauchy&#x27;s home in Paris.

These events marked a turning point in Cauchy&#x27;s life, and a break in his mathematical productivity. Shaken by the fall of the government and moved by a deep hatred of the liberals who were taking power, Cauchy left France to go abroad, leaving his family behind. He spent a short time at Fribourg in Switzerland, where he had to decide whether he would swear a required oath of allegiance to the new regime. He refused to do this, and consequently lost all his positions in Paris, except his membership of the academy, for which an oath was not required. In 1831 Cauchy went to the Italian city of Turin, and after some time there, he accepted an offer from the King of Sardinia (who ruled Turin and the surrounding Piedmont region) for a chair of theoretical physics, which was created especially for him. He taught in Turin during 1832–1833. In 1831, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and the following year a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

In August 1833 Cauchy left Turin for Prague to become the science tutor of the thirteen-year-old Duke of Bordeaux, Henri d&#x27;Artois (1820–1883), the exiled Crown Prince and grandson of Charles X. As a professor of the École Polytechnique, Cauchy had been a notoriously bad lecturer, assuming levels of understanding that only a few of his best students could reach, and cramming his allotted time with too much material. Henri d&#x27;Artois had neither taste nor talent for either mathematics or science. Although Cauchy took his mission very seriously, he did this with great clumsiness, and with surprising lack of authority over Henri d&#x27;Artois. During his civil engineering days, Cauchy once had been briefly in charge of repairing a few of the Parisian sewers, and he made the mistake of mentioning this to his pupil; with great malice, Henri d&#x27;Artois went about saying Cauchy started his career in the sewers of Paris. Cauchy&#x27;s role as tutor lasted until Henri d&#x27;Artois became eighteen years old, in September 1838. Cauchy did hardly any research during those five years, while Henri d&#x27;Artois acquired a lifelong dislike of mathematics. Cauchy was named a baron, a title by which Cauchy set great store.

In 1834, his wife and two daughters moved to Prague, and Cauchy was reunited with his family after four years in exile.

===Last years===
Cauchy returned to Paris and his position at the Academy of Sciences late in 1838. He could not regain his teaching positions, because he still refused to swear an oath of allegiance.
In August 1839 a vacancy appeared in the Bureau des Longitudes. This Bureau bore some resemblance to the academy; for instance, it had the right to co-opt its members. Further, it was believed that members of the Bureau could &quot;forget about&quot; the oath of allegiance, although formally, unlike the Academicians, they were obliged to take it. The Bureau des Longitudes was an organization founded in 1795 to solve the problem of determining position at sea — mainly the longitudinal coordinate, since latitude is easily determined from the position of the sun. Since it was thought that position at sea was best determined by astronomical observations, the Bureau had developed into an organization resembling an academy of astronomical sciences.

In November 1839 Cauchy was elected to the Bureau, and discovered that the matter of the oath was not so easily dispensed with. Without his oath, the king refused to approve his election. For four years Cauchy was in the position of being elected but not approved; accordingly, he was not a formal member of the Bureau, did not receive payment, could not participate in meetings, and could not submit papers. Still Cauchy refused to take any oaths; however, he did feel loyal enough to direct his research to celestial mechanics. In 1840, he presented a dozen papers on this topic to the academy. He described and illustrated the signed-digit representation of numbers, an innovation presented in England in 1727 by John Colson. The confounded membership of the Bureau lasted until the end of 1843, when Cauchy was replaced by Poinsot.

Throughout the nineteenth century the French educational system struggled over the separation of church and state. After losing control of the public education system, the Catholic Church sought to establish its own branch of education and found in Cauchy a staunch and illustrious ally. He lent his prestige and knowledge to the École Normale Écclésiastique, a school in Paris run by Jesuits, for training teachers for their colleges. He took part in the founding of the Institut Catholique. The purpose of this institute was to counter the effects of the absence of Catholic university education in France. These activities did not make Cauchy popular with his colleagues, who, on the whole, supported the Enlightenment ideals of the French Revolution. When a chair of mathematics became vacant at the Collège de France in 1843, Cauchy applied for it, but received just three of 45 votes.

In 1848 King Louis-Philippe fled to England. The oath of allegiance was abolished, and the road to an academic appointment was clear for Cauchy. On March 1, 1849, he was reinstated at the Faculté de Sciences, as a professor of mathematical astronomy. After political turmoil all through 1848, France chose to become a Republic, under the Presidency of Napoleon III of France. Early 1852 the President made himself Emperor of France, and took the name Napoleon III.

The idea came up in bureaucratic circles that it would be useful to again require a loyalty oath from all state functionaries, including university professors. This time a cabinet minister was able to convince the Emperor to exempt Cauchy from the oath. In 1853, Cauchy was elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society. Cauchy remained a professor at the university until his death at the age of 67. He received the Last Rites and died of a bronchial condition at 4 a.m. on 23 May 1857.

His name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.

==Work==

===Early work===
The genius of Cauchy was illustrated in his simple solution of the problem of Apollonius—describing a circle touching three given circles—which he discovered in 1805, his generalization of Euler&#x27;s formula on polyhedra in 1811, and in several other elegant problems. More important is his memoir on wave propagation, which obtained the Grand Prix of the French Academy of Sciences in 1816. Cauchy&#x27;s writings covered notable topics. In the theory of series he developed the notion of convergence and discovered many of the basic formulas for q-series. In the theory of numbers and complex quantities, he was the first to define complex numbers as pairs of real numbers. He also wrote on the theory of groups and substitutions, the theory of functions, differential equations and determinants.

===Wave theory, mechanics, elasticity===
In the theory of light he worked on Fresnel&#x27;s wave theory and on the dispersion and polarization of light. He also contributed research in mechanics, substituting the notion of the continuity of geometrical displacements for the principle of the continuity of matter. He wrote on the equilibrium of rods and elastic membranes and on waves in elastic media. He introduced a 3 × 3 symmetric matrix of numbers that is now known as the Cauchy stress tensor. In elasticity, he originated the theory of stress, and his results are nearly as valuable as those of Siméon Poisson.

===Number theory===
Other significant contributions include being the first to prove the Fermat polygonal number theorem.

===Complex functions===
Cauchy is most famous for his single-handed development of complex function theory. The first pivotal theorem proved by Cauchy, now known as &quot;Cauchy&#x27;s integral theorem&quot;, was the following:

:formula_1

where &quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) is a complex-valued function holomorphic on and within the non-self-intersecting closed curve &quot;C&quot; (contour) lying in the complex plane. The &quot;contour integral&quot; is taken along the contour &quot;C&quot;. The rudiments of this theorem can already be found in a paper that the 24-year-old Cauchy presented to the Académie des Sciences (then still called &quot;First Class of the Institute&quot;) on August 11, 1814. In full form the theorem was given in 1825.

In 1826 Cauchy gave a formal definition of a residue of a function. This concept concerns functions that have poles—isolated singularities, i.e., points where a function goes to positive or negative infinity. If the complex-valued function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) can be expanded in the neighborhood of a singularity &quot;a&quot; as

:formula_2

where φ(&quot;z&quot;) is analytic (i.e., well-behaved without singularities), then &quot;f&quot; is said to have a pole of order &quot;n&quot; in the point &quot;a&quot;. If &quot;n&quot; = 1, the pole is called simple.
The coefficient &quot;B&quot;1 is called by Cauchy the residue of function &quot;f&quot; at &quot;a&quot;. If &quot;f&quot; is non-singular at &quot;a&quot; then the residue of &quot;f&quot; is zero at &quot;a&quot;. Clearly, the residue is in the case of a simple pole equal to
:formula_3
where we replaced &quot;B&quot;1 by the modern notation of the residue.

In 1831, while in Turin, Cauchy submitted two papers to the Academy of Sciences of Turin. In the first he proposed the formula now known as Cauchy&#x27;s integral formula,
:formula_4
where &quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) is analytic on &quot;C&quot; and within the region bounded by the contour &quot;C&quot; and the complex number &quot;a&quot; is somewhere in this region. The contour integral is taken counter-clockwise. Clearly, the integrand has a simple pole at &quot;z&quot; = &quot;a&quot;. In the second paper he presented the residue theorem,
:formula_5
where the sum is over all the &quot;n&quot; poles of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) on and within the contour &quot;C&quot;. These results of Cauchy&#x27;s still form the core of complex function theory as it is taught today to physicists and electrical engineers. For quite some time, contemporaries of Cauchy ignored his theory, believing it to be too complicated. Only in the 1840s the theory started to get response, with Pierre Alphonse Laurent being the first mathematician besides Cauchy to make a substantial contribution (his work on what are now known as Laurent series, published in 1843).

===Cours d&#x27;Analyse===

 In his book &quot;Cours d&#x27;Analyse&quot; Cauchy stressed the importance of rigor in analysis. &quot;Rigor&quot; in this case meant the rejection of the principle of &quot;Generality of algebra&quot; (of earlier authors such as Euler and Lagrange) and its replacement by geometry and infinitesimals. Judith Grabiner wrote Cauchy was &quot;the man who taught rigorous analysis to all of Europe&quot;. The book is frequently noted as being the first place that inequalities, and formula_6 arguments were introduced into calculus. Here Cauchy defined continuity as follows: &quot;The function f(x) is continuous with respect to x between the given limits if, between these limits, an infinitely small increment in the variable always produces an infinitely small increment in the function itself.&quot;

M. Barany claims that the École mandated the inclusion of infinitesimal methods against Cauchy&#x27;s better judgement. Gilain notes that when the portion of the curriculum devoted to &quot;Analyse Algébrique&quot; was reduced in 1825, Cauchy insisted on placing the topic of continuous functions (and therefore also infinitesimals) at the beginning of the Differential Calculus. Laugwitz (1989) and Benis-Sinaceur (1973) point out that Cauchy continued to use infinitesimals in his own research as late as 1853.

Cauchy gave an explicit definition of an infinitesimal in terms of a sequence tending to zero. There has been a vast body of literature written about Cauchy&#x27;s notion of &quot;infinitesimally small quantities&quot;, arguing that they lead from everything from the usual &quot;epsilontic&quot; definitions or to the notions of non-standard analysis. The consensus is that Cauchy omitted or left implicit the important ideas to make clear the precise meaning of the infinitely small quantities he used.

===Taylor&#x27;s theorem===
He was the first to prove Taylor&#x27;s theorem rigorously, establishing his well-known form of the remainder. He wrote a textbook (see the illustration) for his students at the École Polytechnique in which he developed the basic theorems of mathematical analysis as rigorously as possible. In this book he gave the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a limit in the form that is still taught. Also Cauchy&#x27;s well-known test for absolute convergence stems from this book: Cauchy condensation test. In 1829 he defined for the first time a complex function of a complex variable in another textbook. In spite of these, Cauchy&#x27;s own research papers often used intuitive, not rigorous, methods; thus one of his theorems was exposed to a &quot;counter-example&quot; by Abel, later fixed by the introduction of the notion of uniform continuity.

===Argument principle, stability===
In a paper published in 1855, two years before Cauchy&#x27;s death, he discussed some theorems, one of which is similar to the &quot;Principle of the argument&quot; in many modern textbooks on complex analysis. In modern control theory textbooks, the Cauchy argument principle is quite frequently used to derive the Nyquist stability criterion, which can be used to predict the stability of negative feedback amplifier and negative feedback control systems. Thus Cauchy&#x27;s work has a strong impact on both pure mathematics and practical engineering.

==Published works==
Cauchy was very productive, in number of papers second only to Leonhard Euler. It took almost a century to collect all his writings into 27 large volumes:
* (Paris : Gauthier-Villars et fils, 1882–1974)

His greatest contributions to mathematical science are enveloped in the rigorous methods which he introduced; these are mainly embodied in his three great treatises:
* &quot;Le Calcul infinitésimal&quot; (1823)
* &quot;Leçons sur les applications de calcul infinitésimal&quot;; &quot;La géométrie&quot; (1826–1828)
His other works include:
*
*
* &quot;Exercices d&#x27;analyse et de physique mathematique (Volume 1)&quot;
* &quot;Exercices d&#x27;analyse et de physique mathematique (Volume 2)&quot;
* &quot;Exercices d&#x27;analyse et de physique mathematique (Volume 3)&quot;
* &quot;Exercices d&#x27;analyse et de physique mathematique (Volume 4)&quot; (Paris: Bachelier, 1840–1847)
* &quot;Analyse algèbrique&quot; (Imprimerie Royale, 1821)
* &quot;Nouveaux exercices de mathématiques&quot; (Paris : Gauthier-Villars, 1895)
* &quot;Courses of mechanics&quot; (for the École Polytechnique)
* &quot;Higher algebra&quot; (for the )
* &quot;Mathematical physics&quot; (for the Collège de France).
* &quot;Mémoire sur l&#x27;emploi des equations symboliques dans le calcul infinitésimal et dans le calcul aux différences finis&quot; CR Ac ad. Sci. Paris, t. XVII, 449–458 (1843) credited as originating the operational calculus.

==Politics and religious beliefs==
Augustin-Louis Cauchy grew up in the house of a staunch royalist. This made his father flee with the family to Arcueil during the French Revolution. Their life there during that time was apparently hard; Augustin-Louis&#x27;s father, Louis François, spoke of living on rice, bread, and crackers during the period. A paragraph from an undated letter from Louis François to his mother in Rouen says:
 In any event, he inherited his father&#x27;s staunch royalism and hence refused to take oaths to any government after the overthrow of Charles X.

He was an equally staunch Catholic and a member of the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul. He also had links to the Society of Jesus and defended them at the academy when it was politically unwise to do so. His zeal for his faith may have led to his caring for Charles Hermite during his illness and leading Hermite to become a faithful Catholic. It also inspired Cauchy to plead on behalf of the Irish during the Great Famine of Ireland.

His royalism and religious zeal made him contentious, which caused difficulties with his colleagues. He felt that he was mistreated for his beliefs, but his opponents felt he intentionally provoked people by berating them over religious matters or by defending the Jesuits after they had been suppressed. Niels Henrik Abel called him a &quot;bigoted Catholic&quot; and added he was &quot;mad and there is nothing that can be done about him&quot;, but at the same time praised him as a mathematician. Cauchy&#x27;s views were widely unpopular among mathematicians and when Guglielmo Libri Carucci dalla Sommaja was made chair in mathematics before him he, and many others, felt his views were the cause. When Libri was accused of stealing books he was replaced by Joseph Liouville rather than Cauchy, which caused a rift between Liouville and Cauchy. Another dispute with political overtones concerned Jean-Marie Constant Duhamel and a claim on inelastic shocks. Cauchy was later shown, by Jean-Victor Poncelet, to be wrong.

<text>Archimedes of Syracuse ( ; ) was an Ancient Greek mathematician, physicist, engineer, astronomer, and inventor from the ancient city of Syracuse in Sicily. Although few details of his life are known, he is considered one of the leading scientists in classical antiquity. Regarded as the greatest mathematician of ancient history, and one of the greatest of all time, Archimedes anticipated modern calculus and analysis by applying the concept of the infinitely small and the method of exhaustion to derive and rigorously prove many geometrical theorems. These include the area of a circle, the surface area and volume of a sphere, the area of an ellipse, the area under a parabola, the volume of a segment of a paraboloid of revolution, the volume of a segment of a hyperboloid of revolution, and the area of a spiral.

Archimedes&#x27; other mathematical achievements include deriving an approximation of pi (), defining and investigating the Archimedean spiral, and devising a system using exponentiation for expressing very large numbers. He was also one of the first to apply mathematics to physical phenomena, working on statics and hydrostatics. Archimedes&#x27; achievements in this area include a proof of the law of the lever, the widespread use of the concept of center of gravity, and the enunciation of the law of buoyancy known as Archimedes&#x27; principle. In astronomy, he made measurements of the apparent diameter of the Sun and the size of the universe. He is also said to have built a planetarium device that demonstrated the movements of the known celestial bodies, and may have been a precursor to the Antikythera mechanism. He is also credited with designing innovative machines, such as his screw pump, compound pulleys, and defensive war machines to protect his native Syracuse from invasion.

Archimedes died during the siege of Syracuse, when he was killed by a Roman soldier despite orders that he should not be harmed. Cicero describes visiting Archimedes&#x27; tomb, which was surmounted by a sphere and a cylinder that Archimedes requested be placed there to represent his most valued mathematical discovery.

Unlike his inventions, Archimedes&#x27; mathematical writings were little known in antiquity. Alexandrian mathematicians read and quoted him, but the first comprehensive compilation was not made until by Isidore of Miletus in Byzantine Constantinople, while Eutocius&#x27; commentaries on Archimedes&#x27; works in the same century opened them to wider readership for the first time. The relatively few copies of Archimedes&#x27; written work that survived through the Middle Ages were an influential source of ideas for scientists during the Renaissance and again in the 17th century, while the discovery in 1906 of previously lost works by Archimedes in the Archimedes Palimpsest has provided new insights into how he obtained mathematical results.

==Biography==
=== Early life ===

Archimedes was born c. 287 BC in the seaport city of Syracuse, Sicily, at that time a self-governing colony in Magna Graecia. The date of birth is based on a statement by the Byzantine Greek scholar John Tzetzes that Archimedes lived for 75 years before his death in 212 BC. Plutarch wrote in his &quot;Parallel Lives&quot; that Archimedes was related to King Hiero II, the ruler of Syracuse, although Cicero suggests he was of humble origin. In the &quot;Sand-Reckoner&quot;, Archimedes gives his father&#x27;s name as Phidias, an astronomer about whom nothing else is known. A biography of Archimedes was written by his friend Heracleides, but this work has been lost, leaving the details of his life obscure. It is unknown, for instance, whether he ever married or had children, or if he ever visited Alexandria, Egypt, during his youth. From his surviving written works, it is clear that he maintained collegial relations with scholars based there, including his friend Conon of Samos and the head librarian Eratosthenes of Cyrene.

=== Career ===
The standard versions of Archimedes&#x27; life were written long after his death by Greek and Roman historians. The earliest reference to Archimedes occurs in the &quot;Histories&quot; by Polybius ( 200–118 BC), written about 70 years after his death. It sheds little light on Archimedes as a person, and focuses on the war machines that he is said to have built in order to defend the city from the Romans. Polybius remarks how, during the Second Punic War, Syracuse switched allegiances from Rome to Carthage, resulting in a military campaign under the command of Marcus Claudius Marcellus and Appius Claudius Pulcher, who besieged the city from 213 to 212 BC. He notes that the Romans underestimated Syracuse&#x27;s defenses, and mentions several machines Archimedes designed, including improved catapults, crane-like machines that could be swung around in an arc, and other stone-throwers. Although the Romans ultimately captured the city, they suffered considerable losses due to Archimedes&#x27; inventiveness.

Cicero (106–43 BC) mentions Archimedes in some of his works. While serving as a quaestor in Sicily, Cicero found what was presumed to be Archimedes&#x27; tomb near the Agrigentine gate in Syracuse, in a neglected condition and overgrown with bushes. Cicero had the tomb cleaned up and was able to see the carving and read some of the verses that had been added as an inscription. The tomb carried a sculpture illustrating Archimedes&#x27; favorite mathematical proof, that the volume and surface area of the sphere are two-thirds that of an enclosing cylinder including its bases. He also mentions that Marcellus brought to Rome two planetariums Archimedes built. The Roman historian Livy (59 BC–17 AD) retells Polybius&#x27; story of the capture of Syracuse and Archimedes&#x27; role in it.

=== Death ===

Plutarch (45–119 AD) provides at least two accounts on how Archimedes died after Syracuse was taken. According to the most popular account, Archimedes was contemplating a mathematical diagram when the city was captured. A Roman soldier commanded him to come and meet Marcellus, but he declined, saying that he had to finish working on the problem. This enraged the soldier, who killed Archimedes with his sword. Another story has Archimedes carrying mathematical instruments before being killed because a soldier thought they were valuable items. Marcellus was reportedly angered by Archimedes&#x27; death, as he considered him a valuable scientific asset (he called Archimedes &quot;a geometrical Briareus&quot;) and had ordered that he should not be harmed.

The last words attributed to Archimedes are &quot;Do not disturb my circles&quot; (; ), a reference to the mathematical drawing that he was supposedly studying when disturbed by the Roman soldier. There is no reliable evidence that Archimedes uttered these words and they do not appear in Plutarch&#x27;s account. A similar quotation is found in the work of Valerius Maximus (fl. 30 AD), who wrote in &quot;Memorable Doings and Sayings&quot;, &quot;&quot; (&quot;... but protecting the dust with his hands, said &#x27;I beg of you, do not disturb this).

==Discoveries and inventions==

===Archimedes&#x27; principle===
The most widely known anecdote about Archimedes tells of how he invented a method for determining the volume of an object with an irregular shape. According to Vitruvius, a crown for a temple had been made for King Hiero II of Syracuse, who supplied the pure gold to be used. The crown was likely made in the shape of a votive wreath. Archimedes was asked to determine whether some silver had been substituted by the goldsmith without damaging the crown, so he could not melt it down into a regularly shaped body in order to calculate its density.

In this account, Archimedes noticed while taking a bath that the level of the water in the tub rose as he got in, and realized that this effect could be used to determine the golden crown&#x27;s volume. Archimedes was so excited by this discovery that he took to the streets naked, having forgotten to dress, crying &quot;Eureka!&quot; (, &quot;heúrēka&quot;!, ). For practical purposes water is incompressible, so the submerged crown would displace an amount of water equal to its own volume. By dividing the mass of the crown by the volume of water displaced, its density could be obtained; if cheaper and less dense metals had been added, the density would be lower than that of gold. Archimedes found that this is what had happened, proving that silver had been mixed in.

The story of the golden crown does not appear anywhere in Archimedes&#x27; known works. The practicality of the method described has been called into question due to the extreme accuracy that would be required to measure water displacement. Archimedes may have instead sought a solution that applied the hydrostatics principle known as Archimedes&#x27; principle, found in his treatise &quot;On Floating Bodies&quot;: a body immersed in a fluid experiences a buoyant force equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces. Using this principle, it would have been possible to compare the density of the crown to that of pure gold by balancing it on a scale with a pure gold reference sample of the same weight, then immersing the apparatus in water. The difference in density between the two samples would cause the scale to tip accordingly. Galileo Galilei, who invented a hydrostatic balance in 1586 inspired by Archimedes&#x27; work, considered it &quot;probable that this method is the same that Archimedes followed, since, besides being very accurate, it is based on demonstrations found by Archimedes himself.&quot;

===Law of the lever===
While Archimedes did not invent the lever, he gave a mathematical proof of the principle involved in his work &quot;On the Equilibrium of Planes&quot;. Earlier descriptions of the principle of the lever are found in a work by Euclid and in the &quot;Mechanical Problems,&quot; belonging to the Peripatetic school of the followers of Aristotle, the authorship of which has been attributed by some to Archytas.

There are several, often conflicting, reports regarding Archimedes&#x27; feats using the lever to lift very heavy objects. Plutarch describes how Archimedes designed block-and-tackle pulley systems, allowing sailors to use the principle of leverage to lift objects that would otherwise have been too heavy to move. According to Pappus of Alexandria, Archimedes&#x27; work on levers and his understanding of mechanical advantage caused him to remark: &quot;Give me a place to stand on, and I will move the Earth&quot; (). Olympiodorus later attributed the same boast to Archimedes&#x27; invention of the &quot;baroulkos&quot;, a kind of windlass, rather than the lever.

===Archimedes&#x27; screw===

A large part of Archimedes&#x27; work in engineering probably arose from fulfilling the needs of his home city of Syracuse. Athenaeus of Naucratis quotes a certain Moschion in a description on how King Hiero II commissioned the design of a huge ship, the &quot;Syracusia&quot;, which could be used for luxury travel, carrying supplies, and as a display of naval power. The &quot;Syracusia&quot; is said to have been the largest ship built in classical antiquity and, according to Moschion&#x27;s account, it was launched by Archimedes. The ship presumably was capable of carrying 600 people and included garden decorations, a gymnasium, and a temple dedicated to the goddess Aphrodite among its facilities. The account also mentions that, in order to remove any potential water leaking through the hull, a device with a revolving screw-shaped blade inside a cylinder was designed by Archimedes.

Archimedes&#x27; screw was turned by hand, and could also be used to transfer water from a body of water into irrigation canals. The screw is still in use today for pumping liquids and granulated solids such as coal and grain. Described by Vitruvius, Archimedes&#x27; device may have been an improvement on a screw pump that was used to irrigate the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. The world&#x27;s first seagoing steamship with a screw propeller was the SS &quot;Archimedes&quot;, which was launched in 1839 and named in honor of Archimedes and his work on the screw.

===Archimedes&#x27; claw===
Archimedes is said to have designed a claw as a weapon to defend the city of Syracuse. Also known as &quot;&quot;, the claw consisted of a crane-like arm from which a large metal grappling hook was suspended. When the claw was dropped onto an attacking ship the arm would swing upwards, lifting the ship out of the water and possibly sinking it. There have been modern experiments to test the feasibility of the claw, and in 2005 a television documentary entitled &quot;Superweapons of the Ancient World&quot; built a version of the claw and concluded that it was a workable device. 

Archimedes has also been credited with improving the power and accuracy of the catapult, and with inventing the odometer during the First Punic War. The odometer was described as a cart with a gear mechanism that dropped a ball into a container after each mile traveled.

===Heat ray===

As legend has it, Archimedes arranged mirrors as a parabolic reflector to burn ships attacking Syracuse using focused sunlight. While there is no extant contemporary evidence of this feat and modern scholars believe it did not happen, Archimedes may have written a work on mirrors entitled &quot;Catoptrica&quot;, and Lucian and Galen, writing in the second century AD, mentioned that during the siege of Syracuse Archimedes had burned enemy ships. Nearly four hundred years later, Anthemius, despite skepticism, tried to reconstruct Archimedes&#x27; hypothetical reflector geometry.

The purported device, sometimes called &quot;Archimedes&#x27; heat ray&quot;, has been the subject of an ongoing debate about its credibility since the Renaissance. René Descartes rejected it as false, while modern researchers have attempted to recreate the effect using only the means that would have been available to Archimedes, mostly with negative results. It has been suggested that a large array of highly polished bronze or copper shields acting as mirrors could have been employed to focus sunlight onto a ship, but the overall effect would have been blinding, dazzling, or distracting the crew of the ship rather than fire. Using modern materials and larger scale, sunlight-concentrating solar furnaces can reach very high temperatures, and are sometimes used for generating electricity.

===Astronomical instruments===
Archimedes discusses astronomical measurements of the Earth, Sun, and Moon, as well as Aristarchus&#x27; heliocentric model of the universe, in the &quot;Sand-Reckoner&quot;. Without the use of either trigonometry or a table of chords, Archimedes determines the Sun&#x27;s apparent diameter by first describing the procedure and instrument used to make observations (a straight rod with pegs or grooves), applying correction factors to these measurements, and finally giving the result in the form of upper and lower bounds to account for observational error. Ptolemy, quoting Hipparchus, also references Archimedes&#x27; solstice observations in the &quot;Almagest&quot;. This would make Archimedes the first known Greek to have recorded multiple solstice dates and times in successive years.

Cicero&#x27;s &quot;De re publica&quot; portrays a fictional conversation taking place in 129 BC. After the capture of Syracuse in the Second Punic War, Marcellus is said to have taken back to Rome two mechanisms which were constructed by Archimedes and which showed the motion of the Sun, Moon and five planets. Cicero also mentions similar mechanisms designed by Thales of Miletus and Eudoxus of Cnidus. The dialogue says that Marcellus kept one of the devices as his only personal loot from Syracuse, and donated the other to the Temple of Virtue in Rome. Marcellus&#x27;s mechanism was demonstrated, according to Cicero, by Gaius Sulpicius Gallus to Lucius Furius Philus, who described it thus:

This is a description of a small planetarium. Pappus of Alexandria reports on a now lost treatise by Archimedes dealing with the construction of these mechanisms entitled &quot;On Sphere-Making&quot;. Modern research in this area has been focused on the Antikythera mechanism, another device built BC designed with a similar purpose, with some scholars regarding Archimedes&#x27; device as a precursor. Constructing mechanisms of this kind would have required a sophisticated knowledge of differential gearing. This was once thought to have been beyond the range of the technology available in ancient times, but the discovery of the Antikythera mechanism in 1902 has confirmed that devices of this kind were known to the ancient Greeks.

==Mathematics==
While he is often regarded as a designer of mechanical devices, Archimedes also made contributions to the field of mathematics. Plutarch wrote that Archimedes &quot;placed his whole affection and ambition in those purer speculations where there can be no reference to the vulgar needs of life&quot;, though some scholars believe this may be a mischaracterization.

=== Method of exhaustion ===

Archimedes was able to use indivisibles (a precursor to infinitesimals) in a way that is similar to modern integral calculus. Through proof by contradiction (&quot;reductio ad absurdum&quot;), he could give answers to problems to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, while specifying the limits within which the answer lay. This technique is known as the method of exhaustion, and he employed it to approximate the areas of figures and the value of .

In &quot;Measurement of a Circle&quot;, he did this by drawing a larger regular hexagon outside a circle then a smaller regular hexagon inside the circle, and progressively doubling the number of sides of each regular polygon, calculating the length of a side of each polygon at each step. As the number of sides increases, it becomes a more accurate approximation of a circle. After four such steps, when the polygons had 96 sides each, he was able to determine that the value of lay between 3 (approx. 3.1429) and 3 (approx. 3.1408), consistent with its actual value of approximately 3.1416. He also proved that the area of a circle was equal to multiplied by the square of the radius of the circle (formula_1).

=== Archimedean property ===
In &quot;On the Sphere and Cylinder&quot;, Archimedes postulates that any magnitude when added to itself enough times will exceed any given magnitude. Today this is known as the Archimedean property of real numbers.

Archimedes gives the value of the square root of 3 as lying between (approximately 1.7320261) and (approximately 1.7320512) in &quot;Measurement of a Circle&quot;. The actual value is approximately 1.7320508, making this a very accurate estimate. He introduced this result without offering any explanation of how he had obtained it. This aspect of the work of Archimedes caused John Wallis to remark that he was: &quot;as it were of set purpose to have covered up the traces of his investigation as if he had grudged posterity the secret of his method of inquiry while he wished to extort from them assent to his results.&quot; It is possible that he used an iterative procedure to calculate these values.

=== The infinite series ===

In &quot;Quadrature of the Parabola&quot;, Archimedes proved that the area enclosed by a parabola and a straight line is times the area of a corresponding inscribed triangle as shown in the figure at right. He expressed the solution to the problem as an infinite geometric series with the common ratio :

:formula_2

If the first term in this series is the area of the triangle, then the second is the sum of the areas of two triangles whose bases are the two smaller secant lines, and whose third vertex is where the line that is parallel to the parabola&#x27;s axis and that passes through the midpoint of the base intersects the parabola, and so on. This proof uses a variation of the series which sums to .

=== Myriad of myriads ===
In &quot;The Sand Reckoner&quot;, Archimedes set out to calculate a number that was greater than the grains of sand needed to fill the universe. In doing so, he challenged the notion that the number of grains of sand was too large to be counted. He wrote:There are some, King Gelo, who think that the number of the sand is infinite in multitude; and I mean by the sand not only that which exists about Syracuse and the rest of Sicily but also that which is found in every region whether inhabited or uninhabited.To solve the problem, Archimedes devised a system of counting based on the myriad. The word itself derives from the Greek , for the number 10,000. He proposed a number system using powers of a myriad of myriads (100 million, i.e., 10,000 x 10,000) and concluded that the number of grains of sand required to fill the universe would be 8 vigintillion, or 8.

==Writings==

The works of Archimedes were written in Doric Greek, the dialect of ancient Syracuse. Many written works by Archimedes have not survived or are only extant in heavily edited fragments; at least seven of his treatises are known to have existed due to references made by other authors. Pappus of Alexandria mentions &quot;On Sphere-Making&quot; and another work on polyhedra, while Theon of Alexandria quotes a remark about refraction from the &quot;Catoptrica&quot;.

Archimedes made his work known through correspondence with mathematicians in Alexandria. The writings of Archimedes were first collected by the Byzantine Greek architect Isidore of Miletus (), while commentaries on the works of Archimedes written by Eutocius in the same century helped bring his work to a wider audience. Archimedes&#x27; work was translated into Arabic by Thābit ibn Qurra (836–901 AD), and into Latin via Arabic by Gerard of Cremona (c. 1114–1187). Direct Greek to Latin translations were later done by William of Moerbeke (c. 1215–1286) and Iacobus Cremonensis (c. 1400–1453).

During the Renaissance, the &quot;Editio princeps&quot; (First Edition) was published in Basel in 1544 by Johann Herwagen with the works of Archimedes in Greek and Latin.

===Surviving works===
The following are ordered chronologically based on new terminological and historical criteria set by Knorr (1978) and Sato (1986).

==== &quot;Measurement of a Circle&quot; ====

This is a short work consisting of three propositions. It is written in the form of a correspondence with Dositheus of Pelusium, who was a student of Conon of Samos. In Proposition II, Archimedes gives an approximation of the value of pi (), showing that it is greater than (3.1408...) and less than (3.1428...).

==== &quot;The Sand Reckoner&quot; ====

In this treatise, also known as Psammites, Archimedes finds a number that is greater than the grains of sand needed to fill the universe. This book mentions the heliocentric theory of the solar system proposed by Aristarchus of Samos, as well as contemporary ideas about the size of the Earth and the distance between various celestial bodies, and attempts to measure the apparent diameter of the Sun. By using a system of numbers based on powers of the myriad, Archimedes concludes that the number of grains of sand required to fill the universe is 8 in modern notation. The introductory letter states that Archimedes&#x27; father was an astronomer named Phidias. &quot;The Sand Reckoner&quot; is the only surviving work in which Archimedes discusses his views on astronomy.

==== &quot;On the Equilibrium of Planes&quot; ====

There are two books to &quot;On the Equilibrium of Planes&quot;: the first contains seven postulates and fifteen propositions, while the second book contains ten propositions. In the first book, Archimedes proves the law of the lever, which states that:

Archimedes uses the principles derived to calculate the areas and centers of gravity of various geometric figures including triangles, parallelograms and parabolas.

==== &quot;Quadrature of the Parabola&quot; ====

In this work of 24 propositions addressed to Dositheus, Archimedes proves by two methods that the area enclosed by a parabola and a straight line is 4/3 the area of a triangle with equal base and height. He achieves this in one of his proofs by calculating the value of a geometric series that sums to infinity with the ratio 1/4.

==== &quot;On the Sphere and Cylinder&quot; ====
In this two-volume treatise addressed to Dositheus, Archimedes obtains the result of which he was most proud, namely the relationship between a sphere and a circumscribed cylinder of the same height and diameter. The volume is 3 for the sphere, and 23 for the cylinder. The surface area is 42 for the sphere, and 62 for the cylinder (including its two bases), where is the radius of the sphere and cylinder.

==== &quot;On Spirals&quot; ====

This work of 28 propositions is also addressed to Dositheus. The treatise defines what is now called the Archimedean spiral. It is the locus of points corresponding to the locations over time of a point moving away from a fixed point with a constant speed along a line which rotates with constant angular velocity. Equivalently, in modern polar coordinates (, ), it can be described by the equation formula_3 with real numbers and .

This is an early example of a mechanical curve (a curve traced by a moving point) considered by a Greek mathematician.

==== &quot;On Conoids and Spheroids&quot; ====

This is a work in 32 propositions addressed to Dositheus. In this treatise Archimedes calculates the areas and volumes of sections of cones, spheres, and paraboloids.

==== &quot;On Floating Bodies&quot; ====

There are two books of &quot;On Floating Bodies&quot;. In the first book, Archimedes spells out the law of of fluids and proves that water will adopt a spherical form around a center of gravity. This may have been an attempt at explaining the theory of contemporary Greek astronomers such as Eratosthenes that the Earth is round. The fluids described by Archimedes are not since he assumes the existence of a point towards which all things fall in order to derive the spherical shape. Archimedes&#x27; principle of buoyancy is given in this work, stated as follows:

Any body wholly or partially immersed in fluid experiences an upthrust equal to, but opposite in direction to, the weight of the fluid displaced.

In the second part, he calculates the equilibrium positions of sections of paraboloids. This was probably an idealization of the shapes of ships&#x27; hulls. Some of his sections float with the base under water and the summit above water, similar to the way that icebergs float.

==== &quot;Ostomachion&quot; ====
Also known as Loculus of Archimedes or Archimedes&#x27; Box, this is a dissection puzzle similar to a Tangram, and the treatise describing it was found in more complete form in the Archimedes Palimpsest. Archimedes calculates the areas of the 14 pieces which can be assembled to form a square. Reviel Netz of Stanford University argued in 2003 that Archimedes was attempting to determine how many ways the pieces could be assembled into the shape of a square. Netz calculates that the pieces can be made into a square 17,152 ways. The number of arrangements is 536 when solutions that are equivalent by rotation and reflection are excluded. The puzzle represents an example of an early problem in combinatorics.

The origin of the puzzle&#x27;s name is unclear, and it has been suggested that it is taken from the Ancient Greek word for &quot;throat&quot; or &quot;gullet&quot;, &quot;stomachos&quot; (). Ausonius calls the puzzle , a Greek compound word formed from the roots of () and ().

==== The cattle problem ====

Gotthold Ephraim Lessing discovered this work in a Greek manuscript consisting of a 44-line poem in the Herzog August Library in Wolfenbüttel, Germany in 1773. It is addressed to Eratosthenes and the mathematicians in Alexandria. Archimedes challenges them to count the numbers of cattle in the Herd of the Sun by solving a number of simultaneous Diophantine equations. There is a more difficult version of the problem in which some of the answers are required to be square numbers. A. Amthor first solved this version of the problem in 1880, and the answer is a very large number, approximately 7.760271.

==== &quot;The Method of Mechanical Theorems&quot; ====

This treatise was thought lost until the discovery of the Archimedes Palimpsest in 1906. In this work Archimedes uses indivisibles, and shows how breaking up a figure into an infinite number of infinitely small parts can be used to determine its area or volume. He may have considered this method lacking in formal rigor, so he also used the method of exhaustion to derive the results. As with &quot;The Cattle Problem&quot;, &quot;The Method of Mechanical Theorems&quot; was written in the form of a letter to Eratosthenes in Alexandria.

===Apocryphal works===
Archimedes&#x27; &quot;Book of Lemmas&quot; or &quot;Liber Assumptorum&quot; is a treatise with 15 propositions on the nature of circles. The earliest known copy of the text is in Arabic. T. L. Heath and Marshall Clagett argued that it cannot have been written by Archimedes in its current form, since it quotes Archimedes, suggesting modification by another author. The &quot;Lemmas&quot; may be based on an earlier work by Archimedes that is now lost.

It has also been claimed that the formula for calculating the area of a triangle from the length of its sides was known to Archimedes, though its first appearance is in the work of Heron of Alexandria in the 1st century AD. Other questionable attributions to Archimedes&#x27; work include the Latin poem &quot;Carmen de ponderibus et mensuris&quot; (4th or 5th century), which describes the use of a hydrostatic balance, to solve the problem of the crown, and the 12th-century text &quot;Mappae clavicula&quot;, which contains instructions on how to perform assaying of metals by calculating their specific gravities.

===Archimedes Palimpsest===

The foremost document containing Archimedes&#x27; work is the Archimedes Palimpsest. In 1906, the Danish professor Johan Ludvig Heiberg visited Constantinople to examine a 174-page goatskin parchment of prayers, written in the 13th century, after reading a short transcription published seven years earlier by Papadopoulos-Kerameus. He confirmed that it was indeed a palimpsest, a document with text that had been written over an erased older work. Palimpsests were created by scraping the ink from existing works and reusing them, a common practice in the Middle Ages, as vellum was expensive. The older works in the palimpsest were identified by scholars as 10th-century copies of previously lost treatises by Archimedes. The parchment spent hundreds of years in a monastery library in Constantinople before being sold to a private collector in the 1920s. On 29 October 1998, it was sold at auction to an anonymous buyer for a total of $2.2 million.

The palimpsest holds seven treatises, including the only surviving copy of &quot;On Floating Bodies&quot; in the original Greek. It is the only known source of &quot;The Method of Mechanical Theorems&quot;, referred to by Suidas and thought to have been lost forever. &quot;Stomachion&quot; was also discovered in the palimpsest, with a more complete analysis of the puzzle than had been found in previous texts. The palimpsest was stored at the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland, where it was subjected to a range of modern tests including the use of ultraviolet and light to read the overwritten text. It has since returned to its anonymous owner.

The treatises in the Archimedes Palimpsest include:
* &quot;On the Equilibrium of Planes&quot;
* &quot;On Spirals&quot;
* &quot;Measurement of a Circle&quot;
* &quot;On the Sphere and Cylinder&quot;
* &quot;On Floating Bodies&quot;
* &quot;The Method of Mechanical Theorems&quot;
* &quot;Stomachion&quot;
* Speeches by the 4th century BC politician Hypereides
* A commentary on Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Categories&quot;
* Other works

==Legacy==

Sometimes called the father of mathematics and mathematical physics, Archimedes had a wide influence on mathematics and science.

=== Mathematics and physics ===

Historians of science and mathematics almost universally agree that Archimedes was the finest mathematician from antiquity. Eric Temple Bell, for instance, wrote: 
Likewise, Alfred North Whitehead and George F. Simmons said of Archimedes:

Reviel Netz, Suppes Professor in Greek Mathematics and Astronomy at Stanford University and an expert in Archimedes notes:
Leonardo da Vinci repeatedly expressed admiration for Archimedes, and attributed his invention Architonnerre to Archimedes. Galileo Galilei called him &quot;superhuman&quot; and &quot;my master&quot;, while Christiaan Huygens said, &quot;I think Archimedes is comparable to no one&quot;, consciously emulating him in his early work. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz said, &quot;He who understands Archimedes and Apollonius will admire less the achievements of the foremost men of later times&quot;. Gauss&#x27;s heroes were Archimedes and Newton, and Moritz Cantor, who studied under Gauss in the University of Göttingen, reported that he once remarked in conversation that &quot;there had been only three epoch-making mathematicians: Archimedes, Newton, and Eisenstein&quot;.

The inventor Nikola Tesla praised him, saying:

=== Honors and commemorations ===

Italian numismatist and archaeologist Filippo Paruta (1552–1629) and Leonardo Agostini (1593–1676) reported on a bronze coin in Sicily with the portrait of Archimedes on the obverse and a cylinder and sphere with the monogram ARMD in Latin on the reverse. Although the coin is now lost and its date is not precisely known, Ivo Schneider described the reverse as &quot;a sphere resting on a base – probably a rough image of one of the planetaria created by Archimedes,&quot; and suggested it might have been minted in Rome for Marcellus who &quot;according to ancient reports, brought two spheres of Archimedes with him to Rome&quot;.

There is a crater on the Moon named Archimedes () in his honor, as well as a lunar mountain range, the Montes Archimedes ().
The Fields Medal for outstanding achievement in mathematics carries a portrait of Archimedes, along with a carving illustrating his proof on the sphere and the cylinder. The inscription around the head of Archimedes is a quote attributed to 1st century AD poet Manilius, which reads in Latin: &quot;Transire suum pectus mundoque potiri&quot; (&quot;Rise above oneself and grasp the world&quot;).

Archimedes has appeared on postage stamps issued by East Germany (1973), Greece (1983), Italy (1983), Nicaragua (1971), San Marino (1982), and Spain (1963).

The exclamation of Eureka! attributed to Archimedes is the state motto of California. In this instance, the word refers to the discovery of gold near Sutter&#x27;s Mill in 1848 which sparked the California gold rush.

<text>Alternative medicine is any practice that aims to achieve the healing effects of medicine despite lacking biological plausibility, testability, repeatability or evidence of effectiveness. Unlike modern medicine, which employs the scientific method to test plausible therapies by way of responsible and ethical clinical trials, producing repeatable evidence of either effect or of no effect, alternative therapies reside outside of mainstream medicine and do not originate from using the scientific method, but instead rely on testimonials, anecdotes, religion, tradition, superstition, belief in supernatural &quot;energies&quot;, pseudoscience, errors in reasoning, propaganda, fraud, or other unscientific sources. Frequently used terms for relevant practices are [[New Age]] medicine, , unorthodox medicine, holistic medicine, fringe medicine, and unconventional medicine, with little distinction from quackery.

Some alternative practices are based on theories that contradict the established science of how the human body works; others appeal to the supernatural or superstitious to explain their effect or lack thereof. In others, the practice has plausibility but lacks a positive risk–benefit outcome probability. Research into alternative therapies often fails to follow proper research protocols (such as placebo-controlled trials, blind experiments and calculation of prior probability), providing invalid results. History has shown that if a method is proven to work, it eventually ceases to be alternative and becomes mainstream medicine.

Much of the perceived effect of an alternative practice arises from a belief that it will be effective, the placebo effect, or from the treated condition resolving on its own (the natural course of disease). This is further exacerbated by the tendency to turn to alternative therapies upon the failure of medicine, at which point the condition will be at its worst and most likely to spontaneously improve. In the absence of this bias, especially for diseases that are not expected to get better by themselves such as cancer or HIV infection, multiple studies have shown significantly worse outcomes if patients turn to alternative therapies. While this may be because these patients avoid effective treatment, some alternative therapies are actively harmful (e.g. cyanide poisoning from amygdalin, or the intentional ingestion of hydrogen peroxide) or actively interfere with effective treatments.

The alternative medicine sector is a highly profitable industry with a strong lobby, and faces far less regulation over the use and marketing of unproven treatments. Complementary medicine (CM), complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), integrated medicine or integrative medicine (IM), and [[holism|holistic medicine]] attempt to combine alternative practices with those of mainstream medicine. Traditional medicine practices become &quot;alternative&quot; when used outside their original settings and without proper scientific explanation and evidence. Alternative methods are often marketed as more &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;&quot; than methods offered by medical science, that is sometimes derogatorily called &quot;Big Pharma&quot; by supporters of alternative medicine. Billions of dollars have been spent studying alternative medicine, with few or no positive results and many methods thoroughly disproven.
==Definitions and terminology==
The terms &quot;alternative medicine&quot;, &quot;complementary medicine&quot;, &quot;integrative medicine,&quot; &quot;holistic medicine&quot;, &quot;natural medicine&quot;, &quot;unorthodox medicine&quot;, &quot;fringe medicine&quot;, &quot;unconventional medicine&quot;, and &quot;new age medicine&quot; are used interchangeably as having the same meaning and are almost synonymous in most contexts. Terminology has shifted over time, reflecting the preferred branding of practitioners. For example, the United States National Institutes of Health department studying alternative medicine, currently named the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), was established as the &quot;Office of Alternative Medicine&quot; (OAM) and was renamed the &quot;National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine&quot; (NCCAM) before obtaining its current name. Therapies are often framed as &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;holistic&quot;, implicitly and intentionally suggesting that conventional medicine is &quot;artificial&quot; and &quot;narrow in scope&quot;.

The meaning of the term &quot;alternative&quot; in the expression &quot;alternative medicine&quot;, is not that it is an effective alternative to medical science (though some alternative medicine promoters may use the loose terminology to give the appearance of effectiveness).&lt;ref name=&quot;Sampson_6/1995&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Loose terminology may also be used to suggest meaning that a dichotomy exists when it does not (e.g., the use of the expressions &quot;Western medicine&quot; and &quot;Eastern medicine&quot; to suggest that the difference is a cultural difference between the Asian east and the European west, rather than that the difference is between evidence-based medicine and treatments that do not work).

===Alternative medicine===
Alternative medicine is defined loosely as a set of products, practices, and theories that are believed or perceived by their users to have the healing effects of medicine, but whose effectiveness has not been established using scientific methods, or whose theory and practice is not part of biomedicine, or whose theories or practices are directly contradicted by scientific evidence or scientific principles used in biomedicine. &quot;Biomedicine&quot; or &quot;medicine&quot; is that part of medical science that applies principles of biology, physiology, molecular biology, biophysics, and other natural sciences to clinical practice, using scientific methods to establish the effectiveness of that practice. Unlike medicine, an alternative product or practice does not originate from using scientific methods, but may instead be based on hearsay, religion, tradition, superstition, belief in supernatural energies, pseudoscience, errors in reasoning, propaganda, fraud, or other unscientific sources.

Some other definitions seek to specify alternative medicine in terms of its social and political marginality to mainstream healthcare. This can refer to the lack of support that alternative therapies receive from medical scientists regarding access to research funding, sympathetic coverage in the medical press, or inclusion in the standard medical curriculum. For example, a widely used definition devised by the US NCCIH calls it &quot;a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine&quot;. However, these descriptive definitions are inadequate in the present-day when some conventional doctors offer alternative medical treatments and introductory courses or modules can be offered as part of standard undergraduate medical training; alternative medicine is taught in more than half of US medical schools and US health insurers are increasingly willing to provide reimbursement for alternative therapies.

===Complementary or integrative medicine===

Complementary medicine (CM) or integrative medicine (IM) is when alternative medicine is used together with mainstream functional medical treatment in a belief that it improves the effect of treatments. For example, acupuncture (piercing the body with needles to influence the flow of a supernatural energy) might be believed to increase the effectiveness or &quot;complement&quot; science-based medicine when used at the same time. Significant drug interactions caused by alternative therapies may make treatments less effective, notably in cancer therapy.

Several medical organizations differentiate between complementary and alternative medicine including the UK National Health Service (NHS), Cancer Research UK, and the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the latter of which states that &quot;&quot;Complementary medicine&quot; is used in addition to standard treatments&quot; whereas &quot;&quot;Alternative medicine&quot; is used instead of standard treatments.&quot;

Complementary and integrative interventions are used to improve fatigue in adult cancer patients.

David Gorski has described integrative medicine as an attempt to bring pseudoscience into academic science-based medicine with skeptics such as Gorski and David Colquhoun referring to this with the pejorative term &quot;quackademia&quot;. Robert Todd Carroll described Integrative medicine as &quot;a synonym for &#x27;alternative&#x27; medicine that, at its worst, integrates sense with nonsense. At its best, integrative medicine supports both consensus treatments of science-based medicine and treatments that the science, while promising perhaps, does not justify&quot; Rose Shapiro has criticized the field of alternative medicine for rebranding the same practices as integrative medicine.

CAM is an abbreviation of the phrase &quot;complementary and alternative medicine&quot;. The 2019 World Health Organization (WHO) Global Report on Traditional and Complementary Medicine states that the terms complementary and alternative medicine &quot;refer to a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country&#x27;s own traditional or conventional medicine and are not fully integrated into the dominant health care system. They are used interchangeably with traditional medicine in some countries.&quot;

The Integrative Medicine Exam by the American Board of Physician Specialties includes the following subjects: Manual Therapies, Biofield Therapies, Acupuncture, Movement Therapies, Expressive Arts, Traditional Chinese Medicine, Ayurveda, Indigenous Medical Systems, Homeopathic Medicine, Naturopathic Medicine, Osteopathic Medicine, Chiropractic, and Functional Medicine.

===Other terms===

Traditional medicine (TM) refers to certain practices within a culture which have existed since before the advent of medical science, Many TM practices are based on &quot;holistic&quot; approaches to disease and health, versus the scientific evidence-based methods in conventional medicine. The 2019 WHO report defines traditional medicine as &quot;the sum total of the knowledge, skill and practices based on the theories, beliefs and experiences indigenous to different cultures, whether explicable or not, used in the maintenance of health as well as in the prevention, diagnosis, improvement or treatment of physical and mental illness.&quot; When used outside the original setting and in the absence of scientific evidence, TM practices are typically referred to as &quot;alternative medicine&quot;.

 is another rebranding of alternative medicine. In this case, the words &quot;balance&quot; and &quot;holism&quot; are often used alongside &quot;complementary&quot; or &quot;integrative&quot;, claiming to take into fuller account the &quot;whole&quot; person, in contrast to the supposed reductionism of medicine.

===Challenges in defining alternative medicine===
Prominent members of the science and biomedical science community say that it is not meaningful to define an alternative medicine that is separate from a conventional medicine because the expressions &quot;conventional medicine&quot;, &quot;alternative medicine&quot;, &quot;complementary medicine&quot;, &quot;integrative medicine&quot;, and &quot;holistic medicine&quot; do not refer to any medicine at all. Others say that alternative medicine cannot be precisely defined because of the diversity of theories and practices it includes, and because the boundaries between alternative and conventional medicine overlap, are porous, and change. Healthcare practices categorized as alternative may differ in their historical origin, theoretical basis, diagnostic technique, therapeutic practice and in their relationship to the medical mainstream. Under a definition of alternative medicine as &quot;non-mainstream&quot;, treatments considered alternative in one location may be considered conventional in another.

Critics say the expression is deceptive because it implies there is an effective alternative to science-based medicine, and that &quot;complementary&quot; is deceptive because it implies that the treatment increases the effectiveness of (complements) science-based medicine, while alternative medicines that have been tested nearly always have no measurable positive effect compared to a placebo. Journalist John Diamond wrote that &quot;there is really no such thing as alternative medicine, just medicine that works and medicine that doesn&#x27;t&quot;, a notion later echoed by Paul Offit: &quot;The truth is there&#x27;s no such thing as conventional or alternative or complementary or integrative or holistic medicine. There&#x27;s only medicine that works and medicine that doesn&#x27;t. And the best way to sort it out is by carefully evaluating scientific studies—not by visiting Internet chat rooms, reading magazine articles, or talking to friends.&quot;

==Types==

Alternative medicine consists of a wide range of health care practices, products, and therapies. The shared feature is a claim to heal that is not based on the scientific method. Alternative medicine practices are diverse in their foundations and methodologies. Alternative medicine practices may be classified by their cultural origins or by the types of beliefs upon which they are based. Methods may incorporate or be based on traditional medicinal practices of a particular culture, folk knowledge, superstition, spiritual beliefs, belief in supernatural energies (antiscience), pseudoscience, errors in reasoning, propaganda, fraud, new or different concepts of health and disease, and any bases other than being proven by scientific methods. Different cultures may have their own unique traditional or belief based practices developed recently or over thousands of years, and specific practices or entire systems of practices.
===Unscientific belief systems===

Alternative medicine, such as using naturopathy or homeopathy in place of conventional medicine, is based on belief systems not grounded in science.

===Traditional ethnic systems===
Alternative medical systems may be based on traditional medicine practices, such as traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Ayurveda in India, or practices of other cultures around the world. Some useful applications of traditional medicines have been researched and accepted within ordinary medicine, however the underlying belief systems are seldom scientific and are not accepted.

Traditional medicine is considered alternative when it is used outside its home region; or when it is used together with or instead of known functional treatment; or when it can be reasonably expected that the patient or practitioner knows or should know that it will not work – such as knowing that the practice is based on superstition.
===Supernatural energies===
Bases of belief may include belief in existence of supernatural energies undetected by the science of physics, as in biofields, or in belief in properties of the energies of physics that are inconsistent with the laws of physics, as in energy medicine.
===Herbal remedies and other substances===

Substance based practices use substances found in nature such as herbs, foods, non-vitamin supplements and megavitamins, animal and fungal products, and minerals, including use of these products in traditional medical practices that may also incorporate other methods. Examples include healing claims for non-vitamin supplements, fish oil, Omega-3 fatty acid, glucosamine, echinacea, flaxseed oil, and ginseng. Herbal medicine, or phytotherapy, includes not just the use of plant products, but may also include the use of animal and mineral products. It is among the most commercially successful branches of alternative medicine, and includes the tablets, powders and elixirs that are sold as &quot;nutritional supplements&quot;. Only a very small percentage of these have been shown to have any efficacy, and there is little regulation as to standards and safety of their contents.
===Religion, faith healing, and prayer===

===NCCIH classification===
The United States agency National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) has created a classification system for branches of complementary and alternative medicine that divides them into five major groups. These groups have some overlap, and distinguish two types of energy medicine: &quot;veritable&quot; which involves scientifically observable energy (including magnet therapy, colorpuncture and light therapy) and &quot;putative&quot;, which invokes physically undetectable or unverifiable energy. None of these energies have any evidence to support that they affect the body in any positive or health promoting way.

# Whole medical systems: Cut across more than one of the other groups; examples include traditional Chinese medicine, naturopathy, homeopathy, and ayurveda.
# Mind-body interventions: Explore the interconnection between the mind, body, and spirit, under the premise that they affect &quot;bodily functions and symptoms&quot;. A connection between mind and body is conventional medical fact, and this classification does not include therapies with proven function such as cognitive behavioral therapy.
# &quot;Biology&quot;-based practices: Use substances found in nature such as herbs, foods, vitamins, and other natural substances. (As used here, &quot;biology&quot; does &quot;not&quot; refer to the science of biology, but is a usage newly coined by NCCIH in the primary source used for this article. &quot;Biology-based&quot; as coined by NCCIH may refer to chemicals from a nonbiological source, such as use of the poison lead in traditional Chinese medicine, and to other nonbiological substances.)
# Manipulative and body-based practices: feature manipulation or movement of body parts, such as is done in bodywork, chiropractic, and osteopathic manipulation.
# Energy medicine: is a domain that deals with putative and verifiable energy fields:
#* Biofield therapies are intended to influence energy fields that are purported to surround and penetrate the body. The existence of such energy fields have been disproven.
#* Bioelectromagnetic-based therapies use verifiable electromagnetic fields, such as pulsed fields, alternating-current, or direct-current fields in a non-scientific manner.

==History==

The history of alternative medicine may refer to the history of a group of diverse medical practices that were collectively promoted as &quot;alternative medicine&quot; beginning in the 1970s, to the collection of individual histories of members of that group, or to the history of western medical practices that were labeled &quot;irregular practices&quot; by the western medical establishment.&lt;ref name=&quot;RiseRise_6/2004&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Whorton_9/2002&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It includes the histories of complementary medicine and of integrative medicine. Before the 1970s, western practitioners that were not part of the increasingly science-based medical establishment were referred to &quot;irregular practitioners&quot;, and were dismissed by the medical establishment as unscientific and as practicing quackery. Until the 1970s, irregular practice became increasingly marginalized as quackery and fraud, as western medicine increasingly incorporated scientific methods and discoveries, and had a corresponding increase in success of its treatments. In the 1970s, irregular practices were grouped with traditional practices of nonwestern cultures and with other unproven or disproven practices that were not part of biomedicine, with the entire group collectively marketed and promoted under the single expression &quot;alternative medicine&quot;.

Use of alternative medicine in the west began to rise following the counterculture movement of the 1960s, as part of the rising new age movement of the 1970s. This was due to misleading mass marketing of &quot;alternative medicine&quot; being an effective &quot;alternative&quot; to biomedicine, changing social attitudes about not using chemicals and challenging the establishment and authority of any kind, sensitivity to giving equal measure to beliefs and practices of other cultures (cultural relativism), and growing frustration and desperation by patients about limitations and side effects of science-based medicine. At the same time, in 1975, the American Medical Association, which played the central role in fighting quackery in the United States, abolished its quackery committee and closed down its Department of Investigation. By the early to mid 1970s the expression &quot;alternative medicine&quot; came into widespread use, and the expression became mass marketed as a collection of &quot;natural&quot; and effective treatment &quot;alternatives&quot; to science-based biomedicine. By 1983, mass marketing of &quot;alternative medicine&quot; was so pervasive that the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; (&quot;BMJ&quot;) pointed to &quot;an apparently endless stream of books, articles, and radio and television programmes urge on the public the virtues of (alternative medicine) treatments ranging from meditation to drilling a hole in the skull to let in more oxygen&quot;.

An analysis of trends in the criticism of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in five prestigious American medical journals during the period of reorganization within medicine (1965–1999) was reported as showing that the medical profession had responded to the growth of CAM in three phases, and that in each phase, changes in the medical marketplace had influenced the type of response in the journals. Changes included relaxed medical licensing, the development of managed care, rising consumerism, and the establishment of the USA Office of Alternative Medicine (later National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, currently National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health).

===Medical education===
Mainly as a result of reforms following the Flexner Report of 1910 medical education in established medical schools in the US has generally not included alternative medicine as a teaching topic. Typically, their teaching is based on current practice and scientific knowledge about: anatomy, physiology, histology, embryology, neuroanatomy, pathology, pharmacology, microbiology and immunology. Medical schools&#x27; teaching includes such topics as doctor-patient communication, ethics, the art of medicine, and engaging in complex clinical reasoning (medical decision-making). Writing in 2002, Snyderman and Weil remarked that by the early twentieth century the Flexner model had helped to create the 20th-century academic health center, in which education, research, and practice were inseparable. While this had much improved medical practice by defining with increasing certainty the pathophysiological basis of disease, a single-minded focus on the pathophysiological had diverted much of mainstream American medicine from clinical conditions that were not well understood in mechanistic terms, and were not effectively treated by conventional therapies.

By 2001 some form of CAM training was being offered by at least 75 out of 125 medical schools in the US. Exceptionally, the School of Medicine of the University of Maryland, Baltimore, includes a research institute for integrative medicine (a member entity of the Cochrane Collaboration). Medical schools are responsible for conferring medical degrees, but a physician typically may not legally practice medicine until licensed by the local government authority. Licensed physicians in the US who have attended one of the established medical schools there have usually graduated Doctor of Medicine (MD). All states require that applicants for MD licensure be graduates of an approved medical school and complete the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE).

==Efficacy==

There is a general scientific consensus that alternative therapies lack the requisite scientific validation, and their effectiveness is either unproved or disproved. Many of the claims regarding the efficacy of alternative medicines are controversial, since research on them is frequently of low quality and methodologically flawed. Selective publication bias, marked differences in product quality and standardisation, and some companies making unsubstantiated claims call into question the claims of efficacy of isolated examples where there is evidence for alternative therapies.

&quot;The Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine&quot; points to confusions in the general population – a person may attribute symptomatic relief to an otherwise-ineffective therapy just because they are taking something (the placebo effect); the natural recovery from or the cyclical nature of an illness (the regression fallacy) gets misattributed to an alternative medicine being taken; a person not diagnosed with science-based medicine may never originally have had a true illness diagnosed as an alternative disease category.

Edzard Ernst, the first university professor of Complementary and Alternative Medicine, characterized the evidence for many alternative techniques as weak, nonexistent, or negative and in 2011 published his estimate that about 7.4% were based on &quot;sound evidence&quot;, although he believes that may be an overestimate. Ernst has concluded that 95% of the alternative therapies he and his team studied, including acupuncture, herbal medicine, homeopathy, and reflexology, are &quot;statistically indistinguishable from placebo treatments&quot;, but he also believes there is something that conventional doctors can usefully learn from the chiropractors and homeopath: this is the therapeutic value of the placebo effect, one of the strangest phenomena in medicine.

In 2003, a project funded by the CDC identified 208 condition-treatment pairs, of which 58% had been studied by at least one randomized controlled trial (RCT), and 23% had been assessed with a meta-analysis. According to a 2005 book by a US Institute of Medicine panel, the number of RCTs focused on CAM has risen dramatically.

, the Cochrane Library had 145 CAM-related Cochrane systematic reviews and 340 non-Cochrane systematic reviews. An analysis of the conclusions of only the 145 Cochrane reviews was done by two readers. In 83% of the cases, the readers agreed. In the 17% in which they disagreed, a third reader agreed with one of the initial readers to set a rating. These studies found that, for CAM, 38.4% concluded positive effect or possibly positive (12.4%), 4.8% concluded no effect, 0.7% concluded harmful effect, and 56.6% concluded insufficient evidence. An assessment of conventional treatments found that 41.3% concluded positive or possibly positive effect, 20% concluded no effect, 8.1% concluded net harmful effects, and 21.3% concluded insufficient evidence. However, the CAM review used the more developed 2004 Cochrane database, while the conventional review used the initial 1998 Cochrane database.

Alternative therapies do not &quot;complement&quot; (improve the effect of, or mitigate the side effects of) functional medical treatment. Significant drug interactions caused by alternative therapies may instead negatively impact functional treatment by making prescription drugs less effective, such as interference by herbal preparations with warfarin.

In the same way as for conventional therapies, drugs, and interventions, it can be difficult to test the efficacy of alternative medicine in clinical trials. In instances where an established, effective, treatment for a condition is already available, the Helsinki Declaration states that withholding such treatment is unethical in most circumstances. Use of standard-of-care treatment in addition to an alternative technique being tested may produce confounded or difficult-to-interpret results.

Cancer researcher Andrew J. Vickers has stated:

==Perceived mechanism of effect==
Anything classified as alternative medicine by definition does not have a proven healing or medical effect. However, there are different mechanisms through which it can be perceived to &quot;work&quot;. The common denominator of these mechanisms is that effects are mis-attributed to the alternative treatment. 

===Placebo effect===
A placebo is a treatment with no intended therapeutic value. An example of a placebo is an inert pill, but it can include more dramatic interventions like sham surgery. The &quot;placebo effect&quot; is the concept that patients will perceive an improvement after being treated with an inert treatment. The opposite of the placebo effect is the &quot;nocebo effect&quot;, when patients who expect a treatment to be harmful will perceive harmful effects after taking it.

Placebos do not have a physical effect on diseases or improve overall outcomes, but patients may report improvements in subjective outcomes such as pain and nausea. A 1955 study suggested that a substantial part of a medicine&#x27;s impact was due to the placebo effect. However, reassessments found the study to have flawed methodology. This and other modern reviews suggest that other factors like natural recovery and reporting bias should also be considered.

All of these are reasons why alternative therapies may be credited for improving a patient&#x27;s condition even though the objective effect is non-existent, or even harmful. David Gorski argues that alternative treatments should be treated as a placebo, rather than as medicine. Almost none have performed significantly better than a placebo in clinical trials. Furthermore, distrust of conventional medicine may lead to patients experiencing the nocebo effect when taking effective medication.

===Regression to the mean===
A patient who receives an inert treatment may report improvements afterwards that it did not cause. Assuming it was the cause without evidence is an example of the regression fallacy. This may be due to a natural recovery from the illness, or a fluctuation in the symptoms of a long-term condition. The concept of regression toward the mean implies that an extreme result is more likely to be followed by a less extreme result.

===Other factors===
There are also reasons why a placebo treatment group may outperform a &quot;no-treatment&quot; group in a test which are not related to a patient&#x27;s experience. These include patients reporting more favourable results than they really felt due to politeness or &quot;experimental subordination&quot;, observer bias, and misleading wording of questions. In their 2010 systematic review of studies into placebos, Asbjørn Hróbjartsson and Peter C. Gøtzsche write that &quot;even if there were no true effect of placebo, one would expect to record differences between placebo and no-treatment groups due to bias associated with lack of blinding.&quot; Alternative therapies may also be credited for perceived improvement through decreased use or effect of medical treatment, and therefore either decreased side effects or nocebo effects towards standard treatment.

==Use and regulation==
===Appeal===
Practitioners of complementary medicine usually discuss and advise patients as to available alternative therapies. Patients often express interest in mind-body complementary therapies because they offer a non-drug approach to treating some health conditions.

In addition to the social-cultural underpinnings of the popularity of alternative medicine, there are several psychological issues that are critical to its growth, notably psychological effects, such as the will to believe, cognitive biases that help maintain self-esteem and promote harmonious social functioning, and the &quot;post hoc, ergo propter hoc&quot; fallacy.

In a 2018 interview with &quot;The BMJ&quot;, Edzard Ernst stated: &quot;The present popularity of complementary and alternative medicine is also inviting criticism of what we are doing in mainstream medicine. It shows that we aren&#x27;t fulfilling a certain need-we are not giving patients enough time, compassion, or empathy. These are things that complementary practitioners are very good at. Mainstream medicine could learn something from complementary medicine.&quot;

====Marketing====
Alternative medicine is a profitable industry with large media advertising expenditures. Accordingly, alternative practices are often portrayed positively and compared favorably to &quot;big pharma&quot;.

The popularity of complementary &amp; alternative medicine (CAM) may be related to other factors that Ernst mentioned in a 2008 interview in &quot;The Independent&quot;:

Paul Offit proposed that &quot;alternative medicine becomes quackery&quot; in four ways: by recommending against conventional therapies that are helpful, promoting potentially harmful therapies without adequate warning, draining patients&#x27; bank accounts, or by promoting &quot;magical thinking&quot;. Promoting alternative medicine has been called dangerous and unethical.

====Social factors====
Authors have speculated on the socio-cultural and psychological reasons for the appeal of alternative medicines among the minority using them &quot;in lieu&quot; of conventional medicine. There are several socio-cultural reasons for the interest in these treatments centered on the low level of scientific literacy among the public at large and a concomitant increase in antiscientific attitudes and new age mysticism. Related to this are vigorous marketing of extravagant claims by the alternative medical community combined with inadequate media scrutiny and attacks on critics. Alternative medicine is criticized for taking advantage of the least fortunate members of society.

There is also an increase in conspiracy theories toward conventional medicine and pharmaceutical companies, mistrust of traditional authority figures, such as the physician, and a dislike of the current delivery methods of scientific biomedicine, all of which have led patients to seek out alternative medicine to treat a variety of ailments. Many patients lack access to contemporary medicine, due to a lack of private or public health insurance, which leads them to seek out lower-cost alternative medicine. Medical doctors are also aggressively marketing alternative medicine to profit from this market.

Patients can be averse to the painful, unpleasant, and sometimes-dangerous side effects of biomedical treatments. Treatments for severe diseases such as cancer and HIV infection have well-known, significant side-effects. Even low-risk medications such as antibiotics can have potential to cause life-threatening anaphylactic reactions in a very few individuals. Many medications may cause minor but bothersome symptoms such as cough or upset stomach. In all of these cases, patients may be seeking out alternative therapies to avoid the adverse effects of conventional treatments.

===Prevalence of use===
According to research published in 2015, the increasing popularity of CAM needs to be explained by moral convictions or lifestyle choices rather than by economic reasoning.

In developing nations, access to essential medicines is severely restricted by lack of resources and poverty. Traditional remedies, often closely resembling or forming the basis for alternative remedies, may comprise primary healthcare or be integrated into the healthcare system. In Africa, traditional medicine is used for 80% of primary healthcare, and in developing nations as a whole over one-third of the population lack access to essential medicines.

In Latin America, inequities against BIPOC communities keep them tied to their traditional practices and therefore, it is often these communities that constitute the majority of users of alternative medicine. Racist attitudes towards certain communities disable them from accessing more urbanized modes of care. In a study that assessed access to care in rural communities of Latin America, it was found that discrimination is a huge barrier to the ability of citizens to access care; more specifically, women of Indigenous and African descent, and lower-income families were especially hurt. Such exclusion exacerbates the inequities that minorities in Latin America already face. Consistently excluded from many systems of westernized care for socioeconomic and other reasons, low-income communities of color often turn to traditional medicine for care as it has proved reliable to them across generations.

Commentators including David Horrobin have proposed adopting a prize system to reward medical research. This stands in opposition to the current mechanism for funding research proposals in most countries around the world. In the US, the NCCIH provides public research funding for alternative medicine. The NCCIH has spent more than US$2.5 billion on such research since 1992 and this research has not demonstrated the efficacy of alternative therapies. As of 2011, the NCCIH&#x27;s sister organization in the NIC Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine had given out grants of around $105 million each year for several years. Testing alternative medicine that has no scientific basis (as in the aforementioned grants) has been called a waste of scarce research resources.

That alternative medicine has been on the rise &quot;in countries where Western science and scientific method generally are accepted as the major foundations for healthcare, and &#x27;evidence-based&#x27; practice is the dominant paradigm&quot; was described as an &quot;enigma&quot; in the &quot;Medical Journal of Australia&quot;. A 15-year systematic review published in 2022 on the global acceptance and use of CAM among medical specialists found the overall acceptance of CAM at 52% and the overall use at 45%.

====In the United States====
In the United States, the 1974 Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) required that for states to receive federal money, they had to grant religious exemptions to child neglect and abuse laws regarding religion-based healing practices. Thirty-one states have child-abuse religious exemptions.

The use of alternative medicine in the US has increased, with a 50 percent increase in expenditures and a 25 percent increase in the use of alternative therapies between 1990 and 1997 in America. According to a national survey conducted in 2002, &quot;36 percent of U.S. adults aged 18 years and over use some form of complementary and alternative medicine.&quot; Americans spend many billions on the therapies annually. Most Americans used CAM to treat and/or prevent musculoskeletal conditions or other conditions associated with chronic or recurring pain. In America, women were more likely than men to use CAM, with the biggest difference in use of mind-body therapies including prayer specifically for health reasons&quot;. In 2008, more than 37% of American hospitals offered alternative therapies, up from 27 percent in 2005, and 25% in 2004. More than 70% of the hospitals offering CAM were in urban areas.

A survey of Americans found that 88 percent thought that &quot;there are some good ways of treating sickness that medical science does not recognize&quot;. Use of magnets was the most common tool in energy medicine in America, and among users of it, 58 percent described it as at least &quot;sort of scientific&quot;, when it is not at all scientific. In 2002, at least 60 percent of US medical schools have at least some class time spent teaching alternative therapies. &quot;Therapeutic touch&quot; was taught at more than 100 colleges and universities in 75 countries before the practice was debunked by a nine-year-old child for a school science project.

====Prevalence of use of specific therapies====
The most common CAM therapies used in the US in 2002 were prayer (45%), herbalism (19%), breathing meditation (12%), meditation (8%), chiropractic medicine (8%), yoga (5–6%), body work (5%), diet-based therapy (4%), progressive relaxation (3%), mega-vitamin therapy (3%) and visualization (2%).

In Britain, the most often used alternative therapies were Alexander technique, aromatherapy, Bach and other flower remedies, body work therapies including massage, Counseling stress therapies, hypnotherapy, meditation, reflexology, Shiatsu, Ayurvedic medicine, nutritional medicine, and yoga. Ayurvedic medicine remedies are mainly plant based with some use of animal materials. Safety concerns include the use of herbs containing toxic compounds and the lack of quality control in Ayurvedic facilities.

According to the National Health Service (England), the most commonly used complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) supported by the NHS in the UK are: acupuncture, aromatherapy, chiropractic, homeopathy, massage, osteopathy and clinical hypnotherapy.

====In palliative care====
Complementary therapies are often used in palliative care or by practitioners attempting to manage chronic pain in patients. Integrative medicine is considered more acceptable in the interdisciplinary approach used in palliative care than in other areas of medicine. &quot;From its early experiences of care for the dying, palliative care took for granted the necessity of placing patient values and lifestyle habits at the core of any design and delivery of quality care at the end of life. If the patient desired complementary therapies, and as long as such treatments provided additional support and did not endanger the patient, they were considered acceptable.&quot; The non-pharmacologic interventions of complementary medicine can employ mind-body interventions designed to &quot;reduce pain and concomitant mood disturbance and increase quality of life.&quot;

=== Regulation ===
The alternative medicine lobby has successfully pushed for alternative therapies to be subject to far less regulation than conventional medicine. Some professions of complementary/traditional/alternative medicine, such as chiropractic, have achieved full regulation in North America and other parts of the world and are regulated in a manner similar to that governing science-based medicine. In contrast, other approaches may be partially recognized and others have no regulation at all. In some cases, promotion of alternative therapies is allowed when there is demonstrably no effect, only a tradition of use. Despite laws making it illegal to market or promote alternative therapies for use in cancer treatment, many practitioners promote them.

Regulation and licensing of alternative medicine ranges widely from country to country, and state to state. In Austria and Germany complementary and alternative medicine is mainly in the hands of doctors with MDs, and half or more of the American alternative practitioners are licensed MDs. In Germany herbs are tightly regulated: half are prescribed by doctors and covered by health insurance.

Government bodies in the US and elsewhere have published information or guidance about alternative medicine. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has issued online warnings for consumers about medication health fraud. This includes a section on Alternative Medicine Fraud, such as a warning that Ayurvedic products generally have not been approved by the FDA before marketing.

==Risks and problems==

The National Science Foundation has studied the problematic side of the public&#x27;s attitudes and understandings of science fiction, pseudoscience, and belief in alternative medicine. They use a quote from Robert L. Park to describe some issues with alternative medicine:

===Negative outcomes===

According to the Institute of Medicine, use of alternative medical techniques may result in several types of harm:
* &quot;Direct harm, which results in adverse patient outcome.&quot;
* &quot;Economic harm, which results in monetary loss but presents no health hazard;&quot;
* &quot;Indirect harm, which results in a delay of appropriate treatment, or in unreasonable expectations that discourage patients and their families from accepting and dealing effectively with their medical conditions;&quot;

====Interactions with conventional pharmaceuticals====
Forms of alternative medicine that are biologically active can be dangerous even when used in conjunction with conventional medicine. Examples include immuno-augmentation therapy, shark cartilage, bioresonance therapy, oxygen and ozone therapies, and insulin potentiation therapy. Some herbal remedies can cause dangerous interactions with chemotherapy drugs, radiation therapy, or anesthetics during surgery, among other problems. An example of these dangers was reported by Associate Professor Alastair MacLennan of Adelaide University, Australia regarding a patient who almost bled to death on the operating table after neglecting to mention that she had been taking &quot;natural&quot; potions to &quot;build up her strength&quot; before the operation, including a powerful anticoagulant that nearly caused her death.

To &quot;ABC Online&quot;, MacLennan also gives another possible mechanism:

====Side-effects====
Conventional treatments are subjected to testing for undesired side-effects, whereas alternative therapies, in general, are not subjected to such testing at all. Any treatment – whether conventional or alternative – that has a biological or psychological effect on a patient may also have potential to possess dangerous biological or psychological side-effects. Attempts to refute this fact with regard to alternative therapies sometimes use the &quot;appeal to nature&quot; fallacy, i.e., &quot;That which is natural cannot be harmful.&quot; Specific groups of patients such as patients with impaired hepatic or renal function are more susceptible to side effects of alternative remedies.

An exception to the normal thinking regarding side-effects is homeopathy. Since 1938, the FDA has regulated homeopathic products in &quot;several significantly different ways from other drugs.&quot; Homeopathic preparations, termed &quot;remedies&quot;, are extremely dilute, often far beyond the point where a single molecule of the original active (and possibly toxic) ingredient is likely to remain. They are, thus, considered safe on that count, but &quot;their products are exempt from good manufacturing practice requirements related to expiration dating and from finished product testing for identity and strength&quot;, and their alcohol concentration may be much higher than allowed in conventional drugs.

====Treatment delay====
Alternative medicine may discourage people from getting the best possible treatment. Those having experienced or perceived success with one alternative therapy for a minor ailment may be convinced of its efficacy and persuaded to extrapolate that success to some other alternative therapy for a more serious, possibly life-threatening illness. For this reason, critics argue that therapies that rely on the placebo effect to define success are very dangerous. According to mental health journalist Scott Lilienfeld in 2002, &quot;unvalidated or scientifically unsupported mental health practices can lead individuals to forgo effective treatments&quot; and refers to this as opportunity cost. Individuals who spend large amounts of time and money on ineffective treatments may be left with precious little of either, and may forfeit the opportunity to obtain treatments that could be more helpful. In short, even innocuous treatments can indirectly produce negative outcomes. Between 2001 and 2003, four children died in Australia because their parents chose ineffective naturopathic, homeopathic, or other alternative medicines and diets rather than conventional therapies.

====Unconventional cancer &quot;cures&quot;====
There have always been &quot;many therapies offered outside of conventional cancer treatment centers and based on theories not found in biomedicine. These alternative cancer cures have often been described as &#x27;unproven,&#x27; suggesting that appropriate clinical trials have not been conducted and that the therapeutic value of the treatment is unknown.&quot; However, &quot;many alternative cancer treatments have been investigated in good-quality clinical trials, and they have been shown to be ineffective... The label &#x27;unproven&#x27; is inappropriate for such therapies; it is time to assert that many alternative cancer therapies have been &#x27;disproven&#x27;.&quot;

Edzard Ernst has stated:

===Rejection of science===
Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is not as well researched as conventional medicine, which undergoes intense research before release to the public. Practitioners of science-based medicine also discard practices and treatments when they are shown ineffective, while alternative practitioners do not. Funding for research is also sparse making it difficult to do further research for effectiveness of CAM. Most funding for CAM is funded by government agencies. Proposed research for CAM are rejected by most private funding agencies because the results of research are not reliable. The research for CAM has to meet certain standards from research ethics committees, which most CAM researchers find almost impossible to meet. Even with the little research done on it, CAM has not been proven to be effective. Studies that have been done will be cited by CAM practitioners in an attempt to claim a basis in science. These studies tend to have a variety of problems, such as small samples, various biases, poor research design, lack of controls, negative results, etc. Even those with positive results can be better explained as resulting in false positives due to bias and noisy data.

Alternative medicine may lead to a false understanding of the body and of the process of science. Steven Novella, a neurologist at Yale School of Medicine, wrote that government-funded studies of integrating alternative medicine techniques into the mainstream are &quot;used to lend an appearance of legitimacy to treatments that are not legitimate.&quot; Marcia Angell considered that critics felt that healthcare practices should be classified based solely on scientific evidence, and if a treatment had been rigorously tested and found safe and effective, science-based medicine will adopt it regardless of whether it was considered &quot;alternative&quot; to begin with. It is possible for a method to change categories (proven vs. unproven), based on increased knowledge of its effectiveness or lack thereof. Prominent supporters of this position are George D. Lundberg, former editor of the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; (&quot;JAMA&quot;) and the journal&#x27;s interim editor-in-chief Phil Fontanarosa.

Writing in 1999 in &quot;CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians&quot; Barrie R. Cassileth mentioned a 1997 letter to the United States Senate&#x27;s Subcommittee on Public Health and Safety, which had deplored the lack of critical thinking and scientific rigor in OAM-supported research, had been signed by four Nobel Laureates and other prominent scientists. (This was supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).)

In March 2009, a staff writer for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that the impending national discussion about broadening access to health care, improving medical practice and saving money was giving a group of scientists an opening to propose shutting down the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. They quoted one of these scientists, Steven Salzberg, a genome researcher and computational biologist at the University of Maryland, as saying &quot;One of our concerns is that NIH is funding pseudoscience.&quot; They noted that the vast majority of studies were based on fundamental misunderstandings of physiology and disease, and had shown little or no effect.

Writers such as Carl Sagan, a noted astrophysicist, advocate of scientific skepticism and the author of &quot;The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark&quot; (1996), have lambasted the lack of empirical evidence to support the existence of the putative energy fields on which these therapies are predicated.

Sampson has also pointed out that CAM tolerated contradiction without thorough reason and experiment. Barrett has pointed out that there is a policy at the NIH of never saying something does not work, only that a different version or dose might give different results. Barrett also expressed concern that, just because some &quot;alternatives&quot; have merit, there is the impression that the rest deserve equal consideration and respect even though most are worthless, since they are all classified under the one heading of alternative medicine.

Some critics of alternative medicine are focused upon health fraud, misinformation, and quackery as public health problems, notably Wallace Sampson and Paul Kurtz founders of Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine and Stephen Barrett, co-founder of The National Council Against Health Fraud and webmaster of Quackwatch. Grounds for opposing alternative medicine include that:
* Alternative therapies typically lack any scientific validation, and their effectiveness either is unproven or has been disproved.
* It is usually based on religion, tradition, superstition, belief in supernatural energies, pseudoscience, errors in reasoning, propaganda, or fraud.
* Methods may incorporate or base themselves on traditional medicine, folk knowledge, spiritual beliefs, ignorance or misunderstanding of scientific principles, errors in reasoning, or newly conceived approaches claiming to heal.
* Research on alternative medicine is frequently of low quality and methodologically flawed.
* Treatments are not part of the conventional, science-based healthcare system.
* Where alternative therapies have replaced conventional science-based medicine, even with the safest alternative medicines, failure to use or delay in using conventional science-based medicine has caused deaths.

Many alternative medical treatments are not patentable, which may lead to less research funding from the private sector. In addition, in most countries, alternative therapies (in contrast to pharmaceuticals) can be marketed without any proof of efficacy – also a disincentive for manufacturers to fund scientific research.

English evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, in his 2003 book &quot;A Devil&#x27;s Chaplain&quot;, defined alternative medicine as a &quot;set of practices that cannot be tested, refuse to be tested, or consistently fail tests.&quot; Dawkins argued that if a technique is demonstrated effective in properly performed trials then it ceases to be alternative and simply becomes medicine.

CAM is also often less regulated than conventional medicine. There are ethical concerns about whether people who perform CAM have the proper knowledge to treat patients. CAM is often done by non-physicians who do not operate with the same medical licensing laws which govern conventional medicine, and it is often described as an issue of non-maleficence.

According to two writers, Wallace Sampson and K. Butler, marketing is part of the training required in alternative medicine, and propaganda methods in alternative medicine have been traced back to those used by Hitler and Goebels in their promotion of pseudoscience in medicine.

In November 2011 Edzard Ernst stated that the &quot;level of misinformation about alternative medicine has now reached the point where it has become dangerous and unethical. So far, alternative medicine has remained an ethics-free zone. It is time to change this.&quot;

Harriet Hall criticized the low standard of evidence accepted by the alternative medicine community:

===Conflicts of interest===
Some commentators have said that special consideration must be given to the issue of conflicts of interest in alternative medicine. Edzard Ernst has said that most researchers into alternative medicine are at risk of &quot;unidirectional bias&quot; because of a generally uncritical belief in their chosen subject. Ernst cites as evidence the phenomenon whereby 100% of a sample of acupuncture trials originating in China had positive conclusions. David Gorski contrasts evidence-based medicine, in which researchers try to disprove hyphotheses, with what he says is the frequent practice in pseudoscience-based research, of striving to confirm pre-existing notions. Harriet Hall writes that there is a contrast between the circumstances of alternative medicine practitioners and disinterested scientists: in the case of acupuncture, for example, an acupuncturist would have &quot;a great deal to lose&quot; if acupuncture were rejected by research; but the disinterested skeptic would not lose anything if its effects were confirmed; rather their change of mind would enhance their skeptical credentials.

===Use of health and research resources===
Research into alternative therapies has been criticized for &quot;diverting research time, money, and other resources from more fruitful lines of investigation in order to pursue a theory that has no basis in biology.&quot; Research methods expert and author of &quot;Snake Oil Science&quot;, R. Barker Bausell, has stated that &quot;it&#x27;s become politically correct to investigate nonsense.&quot; A commonly cited statistic is that the US National Institute of Health had spent $2.5 billion on investigating alternative therapies prior to 2009, with none being found to be effective.

<doc id="1847" wikidata="Q213486" url="?curid=1847" title="Archimedean solid">
<text>The Archimedean solids are a set of thirteen convex polyhedra whose faces are regular polygons, but not all alike, and whose vertices are all symmetric to each other. The solids were named after Archimedes, although he did not claim credit for them. They belong to the class of uniform polyhedra, the polyhedra with regular faces and symmetric vertices. Some Archimedean solids were portrayed in the works of artists and mathematicians during the Renaissance.

The elongated square gyrobicupola or &quot;&quot; is an extra polyhedron with regular faces and congruent vertices, but it is not generally counted as an Archimedean solid because it is not vertex-transitive.

== The solids ==
The Archimedean solids have a single vertex configuration and highly symmetric properties. A vertex configuration indicates which regular polygons meet at each vertex. For instance, the configuration formula_1 indicates a polyhedron in which each vertex is met by alternating two triangles and two pentagons. Highly symmetric properties in this case mean the symmetry group of each solid were derived from the Platonic solids, resulting from their construction. Some sources say the Archimedean solids are synonymous with the semiregular polyhedron. Yet, the definition of a semiregular polyhedron may also include the infinite prisms and antiprisms, including the elongated square gyrobicupola.

The construction of some Archimedean solids begins from the Platonic solids. The truncation involves cutting away corners; to preserve symmetry, the cut is in a plane perpendicular to the line joining a corner to the center of the polyhedron and is the same for all corners, and an example can be found in truncated icosahedron constructed by cutting off all the icosahedron&#x27;s vertices, having the same symmetry as the icosahedron, the icosahedral symmetry. If the truncation is exactly deep enough such that each pair of faces from adjacent vertices shares exactly one point, it is known as a rectification. Expansion involves moving each face away from the center (by the same distance to preserve the symmetry of the Platonic solid) and taking the convex hull. An example is the rhombicuboctahedron, constructed by separating the cube or octahedron&#x27;s faces from the centroid and filling them with squares. Snub is a construction process of polyhedra by separating the polyhedron faces, twisting their faces in certain angles, and filling them up with equilateral triangles. Examples can be found in snub cube and snub dodecahedron. The resulting construction of these solids gives the property of chiral, meaning they are not identical when reflected in a mirror. However, not all of them can be constructed in such a way, or they could be constructed alternatively. For example, the icosidodecahedron can be constructed by attaching two pentagonal rotunda base-to-base, or rhombicuboctahedron that can be constructed alternatively by attaching two square cupolas on the bases of octagonal prism.

At least ten of the Archimedean solids have the Rupert property: each can pass through a copy of itself, of the same size. They are the cuboctahedron, truncated octahedron, truncated cube, rhombicuboctahedron, icosidodecahedron, truncated cuboctahedron, truncated icosahedron, truncated dodecahedron, and the truncated tetrahedron.

The dual polyhedron of an Archimedean solid is a Catalan solid.

== Background of discovery ==
The names of Archimedean solids were taken from Ancient Greek mathematician Archimedes, who discussed them in a now-lost work. Although they were not credited to Archimedes originally, Pappus of Alexandria in the fifth section of his titled compendium &quot;Synagoge&quot; referring that Archimedes listed thirteen polyhedra and briefly described them in terms of how many faces of each kind these polyhedra have.
During the Renaissance, artists and mathematicians valued pure forms with high symmetry. Some Archimedean solids appeared in Piero della Francesca&#x27;s &quot;De quinque corporibus regularibus&quot;, in attempting to study and copy the works of Archimedes, as well as include citations to Archimedes. Yet, he did not credit those shapes to Archimedes and know of Archimedes&#x27; work but rather appeared to be an independent rediscovery. Other appearance of the solids appeared in the works of Wenzel Jamnitzer&#x27;s &quot;Perspectiva Corporum Regularium&quot;, and both &quot;Summa de arithmetica&quot; and &quot;Divina proportione&quot; by Luca Pacioli, drawn by Leonardo da Vinci. The net of Archimedean solids appeared in Albrecht Dürer&#x27;s &quot;Underweysung der Messung&quot;, copied from the Pacioli&#x27;s work. By around 1620, Johannes Kepler in his &quot;Harmonices Mundi&quot; had completed the rediscovery of the thirteen polyhedra, as well as defining the prisms, antiprisms, and the non-convex solids known as Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra.
Kepler may have also found another solid known as elongated square gyrobicupola or &quot;pseudorhombicuboctahedron&quot;. Kepler once stated that there were fourteen Archimedean solids, yet his published enumeration only includes the thirteen uniform polyhedra. The first clear statement of such solid existence was made by Duncan Sommerville in 1905. The solid appeared when some mathematicians mistakenly constructed the rhombicuboctahedron: two square cupolas attached to the octagonal prism, with one of them rotated in forty-five degrees. The thirteen solids have the property of vertex-transitive, meaning any two vertices of those can be translated onto the other one, but the elongated square gyrobicupola does not. observed that it meets a weaker definition of an Archimedean solid, in which &quot;identical vertices&quot; means merely that the parts of the polyhedron near any two vertices look the same (they have the same shapes of faces meeting around each vertex in the same order and forming the same angles). Grünbaum pointed out a frequent error in which authors define Archimedean solids using some form of this local definition but omit the fourteenth polyhedron. If only thirteen polyhedra are to be listed, the definition must use global symmetries of the polyhedron rather than local neighborhoods. In the aftermath, the elongated square gyrobicupola was withdrawn from the Archimedean solids and included into the Johnson solid instead, a convex polyhedron in which all of the faces are regular polygons.

<text>In geometry, an antiprism or is a polyhedron composed of two parallel direct copies (not mirror images) of an polygon, connected by an alternating band of triangles. They are represented by the Conway notation .

Antiprisms are a subclass of prismatoids, and are a (degenerate) type of snub polyhedron. 

Antiprisms are similar to prisms, except that the bases are twisted relatively to each other, and that the side faces (connecting the bases) are triangles, rather than quadrilaterals.

The dual polyhedron of an -gonal antiprism is an -gonal trapezohedron.

== History ==
In his 1619 book &quot;Harmonices Mundi&quot;, Johannes Kepler observed the existence of the infinite family of antiprisms. This has conventionally been thought of as the first discovery of these shapes, but they may have been known earlier: an unsigned printing block for the net of a hexagonal antiprism has been attributed to Hieronymus Andreae, who died in 1556.

The German form of the word &quot;antiprism&quot; was used for these shapes in the 19th century; Karl Heinze credits its introduction to . Although the English &quot;anti-prism&quot; had been used earlier for an optical prism used to cancel the effects of a primary optical element, the first use of &quot;antiprism&quot; in English in its geometric sense appears to be in the early 20th century in the works of H. S. M. Coxeter.

==Special cases==
=== Right antiprism ===
For an antiprism with regular -gon bases, one usually considers the case where these two copies are twisted by an angle of degrees.

The axis of a regular polygon is the line perpendicular to the polygon plane and lying in the polygon centre.

For an antiprism with congruent &quot;regular&quot; -gon bases, twisted by an angle of degrees, more regularity is obtained if the bases have the same axis: are &quot;coaxial&quot;; i.e. (for non-coplanar bases): if the line connecting the base centers is perpendicular to the base planes. Then the antiprism is called a right antiprism, and its side faces are &quot;isosceles&quot; triangles.

=== Uniform antiprism ===
A uniform -antiprism has two congruent regular -gons as base faces, and equilateral triangles as side faces.

Uniform antiprisms form an infinite class of vertex-transitive polyhedra, as do uniform prisms. For , we have the &quot;digonal antiprism&quot; (degenerate antiprism), which is visually identical to the regular tetrahedron; for , the regular octahedron as a &quot;triangular antiprism&quot; (non-degenerate antiprism).

The Schlegel diagrams of these semiregular antiprisms are as follows:

===Cartesian coordinates===
Cartesian coordinates for the vertices of a right -antiprism (i.e. with regular -gon bases and isosceles triangle side faces, circumradius of the bases equal to 1) are:
:formula_1

where ;

if the -antiprism is uniform (i.e. if the triangles are equilateral), then:
formula_2

===Volume and surface area===
Let be the edge-length of a uniform -gonal antiprism; then the volume is:
formula_3

and the surface area is:
formula_4

Furthermore, the volume of a regular right -gonal antiprism with side length of its bases and height is given by:
formula_5

==== Derivation ====
The circumradius of the horizontal circumcircle of the regular formula_6-gon at the base is
:formula_7
The vertices at the base are at
:formula_8
the vertices at the top are at
:formula_9
Via linear interpolation, points on the outer triangular edges of the antiprism that connect vertices at the bottom with vertices at the top
are at

and at
:formula_11
By building the sums of the squares of the formula_12 and formula_13 coordinates in one of the previous two vectors,
the squared circumradius of this section at altitude formula_14 is

The horizontal section at altitude formula_16 above the base is a formula_17-gon (truncated formula_6-gon)
with formula_6 sides of length formula_20 alternating with formula_6 sides of length formula_22.
(These are derived from the length of the difference of the previous two vectors.)
It can be dissected into formula_6 isoceless triangles of edges formula_24 and formula_25 (semiperimeter formula_26)
plus formula_6
isoceless triangles of edges formula_24 and formula_29 (semiperimeter formula_30).
According to Heron&#x27;s formula the areas of these triangles are
:formula_31
and
:formula_32
The area of the section is formula_33, and the volume is
:formula_34


Note that the volume of a right -gonal prism with the same and is:
formula_35
which is smaller than that of an antiprism.

===Symmetry===
The symmetry group of a right -antiprism (i.e. with regular bases and isosceles side faces) is of order , except in the cases of:
*: the regular tetrahedron, which has the larger symmetry group of order , which has three versions of as subgroups;

*: the regular octahedron, which has the larger symmetry group of order , which has four versions of as subgroups.

The symmetry group contains inversion if and only if is odd.

The rotation group is of order , except in the cases of:
*: the regular tetrahedron, which has the larger rotation group of order , which has three versions of as subgroups;

*: the regular octahedron, which has the larger rotation group of order , which has four versions of as subgroups.

Note: The right -antiprisms have congruent regular -gon bases and congruent isosceles triangle side faces, thus have the same (dihedral) symmetry group as the uniform -antiprism, for .

== Generalizations ==
===In higher dimensions===
Four-dimensional antiprisms can be defined as having two dual polyhedra as parallel opposite faces, so that each three-dimensional face between them comes from two dual parts of the polyhedra: a vertex and a dual polygon, or two dual edges. Every three-dimensional convex polyhedron is combinatorially equivalent to one of the two opposite faces of a four-dimensional antiprism, constructed from its canonical polyhedron and its polar dual. However, there exist four-dimensional polychora that cannot be combined with their duals to form five-dimensional antiprisms.

===Self-crossing polyhedra===


Uniform star antiprisms are named by their star polygon bases, and exist in prograde and in retrograde (crossed) solutions. Crossed forms have intersecting vertex figures, and are denoted by &quot;inverted&quot; fractions: instead of ; example: 5/3 instead of 5/2.

A right star antiprism has two congruent coaxial regular convex or star polygon base faces, and isosceles triangle side faces.

Any star antiprism with &quot;regular&quot; convex or star polygon bases can be made a &quot;right&quot; star antiprism (by translating and/or twisting one of its bases, if necessary).

In the retrograde forms, but not in the prograde forms, the triangles joining the convex or star bases intersect the axis of rotational symmetry. Thus:

*Retrograde star antiprisms with regular convex polygon bases cannot have all equal edge lengths, and so cannot be uniform. &quot;Exception&quot;: a retrograde star antiprism with equilateral triangle bases (vertex configuration: 3.3/2.3.3) can be uniform; but then, it has the appearance of an equilateral triangle: it is a degenerate star polyhedron.

*Similarly, some retrograde star antiprisms with regular star polygon bases cannot have all equal edge lengths, and so cannot be uniform. Example: a retrograde star antiprism with regular star 7/5-gon bases (vertex configuration: 3.3.3.7/5) cannot be uniform.

Also, star antiprism compounds with regular star -gon bases can be constructed if and have common factors. Example: a star 10/4-antiprism is the compound of two star 5/2-antiprisms.

<text>The natural history of Africa encompasses some of the well known megafauna of that continent.

Natural history is the study and description of organisms and natural objects, especially their origins, evolution, and interrelationships.

==Flora==
The vegetation of Africa follows very closely the distribution of heat and moisture. The northern and southern temperate zones have a flora distinct from that of the continent generally, which is tropical. In the countries bordering the Mediterranean, there are groves of orange and olive trees, evergreen oaks, cork trees and pines, intermixed with cypresses, myrtles, arbutus and fragrant tree-heaths.

South of the Atlas Mountains, the conditions alter. The zones of minimum rainfall have a very scanty flora, consisting of plants adapted to resist the great dryness. Characteristic of the Sahara is the date palm, which flourishes where other vegetation can scarcely maintain existence, while in the semidesert regions the acacia, from which gum arabic is obtained, is abundant.

The more humid regions have a richer vegetation; dense forest where the rainfall is greatest and variations of temperature least, conditions found chiefly on the tropical coasts, and in the west African equatorial basin with its extension towards the upper Nile; and savanna interspersed with trees on the greater part of the plateaus, passing as the desert regions are approached into a scrub vegetation consisting of thorny acacias, etc. Forests also occur on the humid slopes of mountain ranges up to a certain elevation. In the coast regions, the typical tree is the mangrove, which flourishes wherever the soil is of a swamp character.

The dense forests of West Africa contain, in addition to a great variety of hardwoods, two palms, &quot;Elaeis guineensis&quot; (oil palm) and &quot;Raphia vinifera&quot; (bamboo palm), not found, generally speaking, in the savanna regions. &quot;Bombax&quot; or silk cotton trees attain gigantic proportions in the forests, which are the home of the India rubber-producing plants and of many valuable kinds of timber trees, such as odum (&quot;Chlorophora excelsa&quot;), ebony, mahogany (&quot;Khaya senegalensis&quot;), &quot;Oldfieldia&quot; (&quot;Oldfieldia africana&quot;) and camwood (&quot;Baphia nitida&quot;). The climbing plants in the tropical forests are exceedingly luxuriant and the undergrowth or &quot;bush&quot; is extremely dense.

In the savannas the most characteristic trees are the monkey-bread tree or baobab (&quot;Adansonia digitata&quot;), doum palm (&quot;Hyphaene&quot;) and euphorbias. The coffee plant grows wild in such widely separated places as Liberia and southern Ethiopia. The higher mountains have a special flora showing close agreement over wide intervals of space, as well as affinities with the mountain flora of the eastern Mediterranean, the Himalaya and Indo-China.

In the swamp regions of north-east Africa, papyrus and associated plants, including the soft-wooded ambach, flourished in immense quantities, and little else is found in the way of vegetation. South Africa is largely destitute of forest, save in the lower valleys and coast regions. Tropical flora disappears, and in the semi-desert plains the fleshy, leafless, contorted species of kapsias, mesembryanthemums, aloes and other succulent plants make their appearance. There are, too, valuable timber trees, such as the yellowwood (&quot;Podocarpus elongatus&quot;), stinkwood (&quot;Ocotea&quot;), sneezewood or Cape ebony (&quot;Pteroxylon utile&quot;) and ironwood. Extensive miniature woods of heaths are found in almost endless variety and covered throughout the greater part of the year with innumerable blossoms in which red is very prevalent. Of the grasses of Africa, alfa is very abundant in the plateaus of the Atlas range.

==Fauna==
The fauna again shows the effect of the characteristics of the vegetation. The open savannas are the home of large ungulates, especially antelopes, the giraffe (peculiar to Africa), zebra, buffalo, wild donkey and four species of rhinoceros; and of carnivores, such as the lion, leopard, hyena, etc. The okapi (a genus restricted to Africa) is found only in the dense forests of the Congo basin. Bears are confined to the Atlas region, wolves and foxes to North Africa. The elephant (though its range has become restricted through the attacks of hunters) is found both in the savannas and forest regions, the latter being otherwise poor in large game, though the special habitat of the chimpanzee and gorilla. Baboons and mandrills, with few exceptions, are peculiar to Africa. The single-humped camel, as a domestic animal, is especially characteristic of the northern deserts and steppes.

The rivers in the tropical zone abound with hippopotami and crocodiles, the former entirely confined to Africa. The vast herds of game, formerly so characteristic of many parts of Africa, have much diminished with the increase of intercourse with the interior. Game reserves have, however, been established in South Africa, Central Africa, East Africa, Somaliland, etc., while measures for the protection of wild animals were laid down in an international convention signed in May 1900.

The ornithology of northern Africa presents a close resemblance to that of southern Europe, scarcely a species being found which does not also occur in the other countries bordering the Mediterranean. Among the birds most characteristic of Africa are the ostrich and the secretarybird. The ostrich is widely dispersed, but is found chiefly in the desert and steppe regions. The secretarybird is common in the south. The weaver birds and their allies, including the long-tailed whydahs, are abundant, as are, among game-birds, the francolin and guineafowl. Many of the smaller birds, such as the sunbirds, bee-eaters, the parrots and kingfishers, as well as the larger plantain-eaters, are noted for the brilliance of their feathers.

Of reptiles, the lizard and chameleon are common, and there are a number of venomous snakes, though these are not so numerous as in other tropical countries.

The scorpion is abundant. Of insects, Africa has many thousand different kinds; of these the locust is the proverbial scourge of the continent, and the ravages of the termites are almost incredible. The spread of malaria by means of mosquitoes is common. The tsetse fly, whose bite is fatal to all domestic animals, is common in many districts of South and East Africa. It is found nowhere outside Africa.

<text>Africa is a continent comprising 63 political territories, representing the largest of the great southward projections from the main mass of Earth&#x27;s surface. Within its regular outline, it comprises an area of , excluding adjacent islands. Its highest mountain is Kilimanjaro; its largest lake is Lake Victoria.

Separated from Europe by the Mediterranean Sea and from much of Asia by the Red Sea, Africa is joined to Asia at its northeast extremity by the Isthmus of Suez (which is transected by the Suez Canal), wide. For geopolitical purposes, the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt – east of the Suez Canal – is often considered part of Africa. From the most northerly point, Ras ben Sakka in Tunisia, at 37°21′ N, to the most southerly point, Cape Agulhas in South Africa, 34°51′15″ S, is a distance approximately of ; from Cap-Vert, 17°31′13″W, the westernmost point, to Ras Hafun in the Somali Puntland region, in the Horn of Africa, 51°27′52″ E, the most easterly projection, is a distance (also approximately) of .

The main structural lines of the continent show both the east-to-west direction characteristic, at least in the eastern hemisphere, of the more northern parts of the world, and the north-to-south direction seen in the southern peninsulas. Africa is thus mainly composed of two segments at right angles, the northern running from east to west, and the southern from north to south.

==Main features==

The average elevation of the continent approximates closely to above sea level, roughly near to the mean elevation of both North and South America, but considerably less than that of Asia, . In contrast with other continents, it is marked by the comparatively small area of either very high or very low ground, lands under occupying an unusually small part of the surface; while not only are the highest elevations inferior to those of Asia or South America, but the area of land over is also quite insignificant, being represented almost entirely by individual peaks and mountain ranges. Moderately elevated tablelands are thus the characteristic feature of the continent, though the surface of these is broken by higher peaks and ridges. (So prevalent are these isolated peaks and ridges that a specialised term—&quot;Inselberg-Landschaft&quot;, island mountain landscape—has been adopted in Germany to describe this kind of country, thought to be in great part the result of wind action.)

As a general rule, the higher tablelands lie to the east and south, while a progressive diminution in altitude towards the west and north is observable. Apart from the lowlands and the Atlas Mountains, the continent may be divided into two regions of higher and lower plateaus, the dividing line (somewhat concave to the northwest) running from the middle of the Red Sea to about 6 degrees south on the west coast.

Africa can be divided into a number of geographic zones:

* The coastal plains—often fringed seawards by mangrove swamps—never stretching far from the coast, apart from the lower courses of streams. Recent alluvial flats are found chiefly in the delta of the more important rivers. Elsewhere, the coastal lowlands merely form the lowest steps of the system of terraces that constitutes the ascent to the inner plateaus.
* The Atlas range—orthographically distinct from the rest of the continent, being unconnected with and separated from the south by a depressed and desert area (the Sahara).

==Plateau region==

There are many plateaus in Africa.

The high southern and eastern plateaus, rarely falling below , have a mean elevation of about . The South African plateau, as far as about 12° S, is bounded east, west and south by bands of high ground which fall steeply to the coasts. On this account South Africa has a general resemblance to an inverted saucer. Due south, the plateau rim is formed by three parallel steps with level ground between them. The largest of these level areas, the Great Karoo, is a dry, barren region, and a large tract of the plateau proper is of a still more arid character and is known as the Kalahari Desert.

The South African plateau is connected towards East African plateau, with probably a slightly greater average elevation, and marked by some distinct features. It is formed by a widening out of the eastern axis of high ground, which becomes subdivided into a number of zones running north and south and consisting in turn of ranges, tablelands and depressions. The most striking feature is the existence of two great lines of depression, due largely to the subsidence of whole segments of the Earth&#x27;s crust, the lowest parts of which are occupied by vast lakes. Towards the south the two lines converge and give place to one great valley (occupied by Lake Nyasa), the southern part of which is less distinctly due to rifting and subsidence than the rest of the system.

Farther north the western hollow, known as the Albertine Rift, is occupied for more than half its length by water, forming the Great Lakes of Tanganyika, Kivu, Lake Edward and Lake Albert, the first-named over long and the longest freshwater lake in the world. Associated with these great valleys are a number of volcanic peaks, the greatest of which occur on a meridional line east of the eastern trough. The eastern branch of the East African Rift, contains much smaller lakes, many of them brackish and without outlet, the only one comparable to those of the western trough being Lake Turkana or Basso Norok.

A short distance east of this rift valley is Mount Kilimanjaro – with its two peaks Kibo and Mawenzi, the latter being , and the culminating point of the whole continent – and Mount Kenya, which is . Hardly less important is the Ruwenzori Range, over , which lies east of the western trough. Other volcanic peaks rise from the floor of the valleys, some of the Kirunga (Mfumbiro) group, north of Lake Kivu, being still partially active. This could cause most of the cities and states to be flooded with lava and ash.

The third division of the higher region of Africa is formed by the Ethiopian Highlands, a rugged mass of mountains forming the largest continuous area of its altitude in the whole continent, little of its surface falling below , while the summits reach heights of 4400 m to 4550 m. This block of country lies just west of the line of the great East African Trough, the northern continuation of which passes along its eastern escarpment as it runs up to join the Red Sea. There is, however, in the centre a circular basin occupied by Lake Tsana.

Both in the east and west of the continent the bordering highlands are continued as strips of plateau parallel to the coast, the Ethiopian mountains being continued northwards along the Red Sea coast by a series of ridges reaching in places a height of . In the west the zone of high land is broader but somewhat lower. The most mountainous districts lie inland from the head of the Gulf of Guinea (Adamawa, etc.), where heights of are reached. Exactly at the head of the gulf the great peak of the Cameroon, on a line of volcanic action continued by the islands to the south-west, has a height of , while Clarence Peak, in Fernando Po, the first of the line of islands, rises to over . Towards the extreme west the Futa Jallon highlands form an important diverging point of rivers, but beyond this, as far as the Atlas chain, the elevated rim of the continent is almost wanting.

==Plains==
Much of Africa is made up of plains of the pediplain and etchplain type often occurring as steps. The etchplains are commonly associated with laterite soil and inselbergs. Inselberg-dotted plains are common in Africa including Tanzania, the Anti-Atlas of Morocco, Namibia, and the interior of Angola. One of the most wideaspread plain is the African Surface, a composite etchplain occurring across much of the continent. 
The area between the east and west coast highlands, which north of 17° N is mainly desert, is divided into separate basins by other bands of high ground, one of which runs nearly centrally through North Africa in a line corresponding roughly with the curved axis of the continent as a whole. The best marked of the basins so formed (the Congo Basin) occupies a circular area bisected by the equator, once probably the site of an inland sea.

Running along the south of desert is the plains region known as the Sahel.

The arid region, the Sahara — the largest hot desert in the world, covering  — extends from the Atlantic to the Red Sea. Though generally of slight elevation, it contains mountain ranges with peaks rising to Bordered N.W. by the Atlas range, to the northeast a rocky plateau separates it from the Mediterranean; this plateau gives place at the extreme east to the delta of the Nile. That river (see below) pierces the desert without modifying its character. The Atlas range, the north-westerly part of the continent, between its seaward and landward heights encloses elevated steppes in places broad. From the inner slopes of the plateau numerous wadis take a direction towards the Sahara. The greater part of that now desert region is, indeed, furrowed by old water-channels.

==Mountains==

The mountains are an exception to Africa&#x27;s general landscape. Geographers came up with the idea of &quot;high Africa&quot; and &quot;low Africa&quot; to help distinguish the difference in Geography; &quot;high Africa&quot; extending from Ethiopia down south to South Africa and the Cape of Good Hope while &quot;low Africa&quot; representing the plains of the rest of the continent. The following table gives the details of the chief mountains and ranges of the continent:

== Rivers ==
From the outer margin of the African plateaus, a large number of streams run to the sea with comparatively short courses, while the larger rivers flow for long distances on the interior highlands, before breaking through the outer ranges. The main drainage of the continent is to the north and west, or towards the basin of the Atlantic Ocean.

To the main African rivers belong: Nile (the longest river of Africa), Congo (river with the highest water discharge on the continent) and the Niger, which flows half of its length through the arid areas. The largest lakes are the following: Lake Victoria (Lake Ukerewe), Lake Chad, in the centre of the continent, Lake Tanganyika, lying between the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, Tanzania and Zambia. There is also the considerably large Lake Malawi stretching along the eastern border of Malawi. There are also numerous water dams throughout the continent: Kariba on the river of Zambezi, Asuan in Egypt on the river of Nile, and Akosombo, the continent&#x27;s biggest dam on the Volta River in Ghana (Fobil 2003).
The high lake plateau of the African Great Lakes region contains the headwaters of both the Nile and the Congo.

The break-up of Gondwana in Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic times led to a major reorganization of the river courses of various large African rivers including the Congo, Niger, Nile, Orange, Limpopo and Zambezi rivers.

===Flowing to the Mediterranean Sea===
The upper Nile receives its chief supplies from the mountainous region adjoining the Central African trough in the neighborhood of the equator. From there, streams pour eastward into Lake Victoria, the largest lake in Africa (covering over 26,000 square m.), and to the west and north into Lake Edward and Lake Albert. To the latter of these, the effluents of the other two lakes add their waters. Issuing from there, the Nile flows northward, and between the latitudes of 7 and 10 degrees north it traverses a vast marshy level, where its course is liable to being blocked by floating vegetation. After receiving the Bahr-el-Ghazal from the west and the Sobat, Blue Nile and Atbara from the Ethiopian Highlands (the chief gathering ground of the flood-water), it separates the great desert with its fertile watershed, and enters the Mediterranean at a vast delta.

===Flowing to the Atlantic Ocean===
The most remote head-stream of the Congo is the Chambezi, which flows southwest into the marshy Lake Bangweulu. From this lake issues the Congo, known in its upper course by various names. Flowing first south, it afterwards turns north through Lake Mweru and descends to the forest-clad basin of west equatorial Africa. Traversing this in a majestic northward curve, and receiving vast supplies of water from many great tributaries, it finally turns southwest and cuts a way to the Atlantic Ocean through the western highlands. The area of the Congo basin is greater than that of any other river except the Amazon, while the African inland drainage area is greater than that of any continent but Asia, where the corresponding area is .

West of Lake Chad is the basin of the Niger, the third major river of Africa. With its principal source in the far west, it reverses the direction of flow exhibited by the Nile and Congo, and ultimately flows into the Atlantic — a fact that eluded European geographers for many centuries. An important branch, however — the Benue — flows from the southeast.

These four river basins occupy the greater part of the lower plateaus of North and West Africa — the remainder consists of arid regions watered only by intermittent streams that do not reach the sea.

Of the remaining rivers of the Atlantic basin, the Orange, in the extreme south, brings the drainage from the Drakensberg on the opposite side of the continent, while the Kunene, Kwanza, Ogowe and Sanaga drain the west coastal highlands of the southern limb; the Volta, Komoe, Bandama, Gambia and Senegal the highlands of the western limb. North of the Senegal, for over of coast, the arid region reaches to the Atlantic. Farther north are the streams, with comparatively short courses, reaching the Atlantic and Mediterranean from the Atlas mountains.

===Flowing to the Indian Ocean===
Of the rivers flowing to the Indian Ocean, the only one draining any large part of the interior plateaus is the Zambezi, whose western branches rise in the western coastal highlands. The main stream has its rise in 11°21′3″ S 24°22′ E, at an elevation of . It flows to the west and south for a considerable distance before turning eastward. All the largest tributaries, including the Shire, the outflow of Lake Nyasa, flow down the southern slopes of the band of high ground stretching across the continent from 10° to 12° S. In the southwest, the Zambezi system interlaces with that of the Taukhe (or Tioghe), from which it at times receives surplus water. The rest of the water of the Taukhe, known in its middle course as the Okavango, is lost in a system of swamps and saltpans that was formerly centred in Lake Ngami, now dried up.

Farther south, the Limpopo drains a portion of the interior plateau, but breaks through the bounding highlands on the side of the continent nearest its source. The Rovuma, Rufiji and Tana principally drain the outer slopes of the African Great Lakes highlands.

In the Horn region to the north, the Jubba and the Shebelle rivers begin in the Ethiopian Highlands. These rivers mainly flow southwards, with the Jubba emptying in the Indian Ocean. The Shebelle River reaches a point to the southwest. After that, it consists of swamps and dry reaches before finally disappearing in the desert terrain near the Jubba River. Another large stream, the Hawash, rising in the Ethiopian mountains, is lost in a saline depression near the Gulf of Aden.

===Inland basins===
Between the basins of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, there is an area of inland drainage along the centre of the Ethiopian plateau, directed chiefly into the lakes in the Great Rift Valley. The largest river is the Omo, which, fed by the rains of the Ethiopian highlands, carries down a large body of water into Lake Turkana. The rivers of Africa are generally obstructed either by bars at their mouths, or by cataracts at no great distance upstream. But when these obstacles have been overcome, the rivers and lakes afford a vast network of navigable waters.

North of the Congo basin, and separated from it by a broad undulation of the surface, is the basin of Lake Chad — a flat-shored, shallow lake filled principally by the Chari coming from the southeast.

==Lakes==
The principal lakes of Africa are situated in the African Great Lakes plateau. 
The lakes found within the Great Rift Valley have steep sides and are very deep. 
This is the case with the two largest of the type, Tanganyika and Nyasa, the latter with depths of .

Others, however, are shallow, and hardly reach the steep sides of the valleys in the dry season. 
Such are Lake Rukwa, in a subsidiary depression north of Nyasa, and Eiassi and Manyara in the system of the Great Rift Valley. 
Lakes of the broad type are of moderate depth, the deepest sounding in Lake Victoria being under .

Besides the African Great Lakes, the principal lakes on the continent are: Lake Chad, in the northern inland watershed; Bangweulu and Mweru, traversed by the head-stream of the Congo; and Lake Mai-Ndombe and Ntomba (Mantumba), within the great bend of that river. All, except possibly Mweru, are more or less shallow, and Lake Chad appears to be drying up.

Divergent opinions have been held as to the mode of origin of the African Great Lakes, especially Tanganyika, which some geologists have considered to represent an old arm of the sea, dating from a time when the whole central Congo basin was under water; others holding that the lake water has accumulated in a depression caused by subsidence. The former view is based on the existence in the lake of organisms of a decidedly marine type. They include jellyfish, molluscs, prawns, crabs, etc.

==Islands==
With the exception of Madagascar, the African islands are small. Madagascar, with an area of , is, after Greenland, New Guinea and Borneo, the fourth largest island on the Earth. It lies in the Indian Ocean, off the southeast coast of the continent, from which it is separated by the deep Mozambique Channel, wide at its narrowest point. Madagascar in its general structure, as in flora and fauna, forms a connecting link between Africa and southern Asia. East of Madagascar are the small islands of Mauritius and Réunion. There are also islands in the Gulf of Guinea on which lies the Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe (islands of São Tomé and Príncipe). Part of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea is lying on the island of Bioko (with the capital Malabo and the town of Lubu) and the island of Annobón. Socotra lies E.N.E. of Cape Guardafui. Off the north-west coast are the Canary and Cape Verde archipelagoes. which, like some small islands in the Gulf of Guinea, are of volcanic origin. The South Atlantic Islands of Saint Helena and Ascension are classed as Africa but are situated on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge halfway to South America.

==Climatic conditions==
Lying almost entirely within the tropics, and equally to north and south of the equator, Africa does not show excessive variations of temperature.

Great heat is experienced in the lower plains and desert regions of North Africa, removed by the great width of the continent from the influence of the ocean, and here, too, the contrast between day and night, and between summer and winter, is greatest. (The rarity of the air and the great radiation during the night cause the temperature in the Sahara to fall occasionally to freezing point.)
Farther south, the heat is to some extent modified by the moisture brought from the ocean, and by the greater elevation of a large part of the surface, especially in East Africa, where the range of temperature is wider than in the Congo basin or on the Guinea coast.
In the extreme north and south the climate is a warm temperate one, the northern countries being on the whole hotter and drier than those in the southern zone; the south of the continent being narrower than the north, the influence of the surrounding ocean is more felt.

The most important climatic differences are due to variations in the amount of rainfall. The wide heated plains of the Sahara, and in a lesser degree the corresponding zone of the Kalahari in the south, have an exceedingly scanty rainfall, the winds which blow over them from the ocean losing part of their moisture as they pass over the outer highlands, and becoming constantly drier owing to the heating effects of the burning soil of the interior; while the scarcity of mountain ranges in the more central parts likewise tends to prevent condensation. In the inter-tropical zone of summer precipitation, the rainfall is greatest when the sun is vertical or soon after. It is therefore greatest of all near the equator, where the sun is twice vertical, and less in the direction of both tropics.

The rainfall zones are, however, somewhat deflected from a due west-to-east direction, the drier northern conditions extending southwards along the east coast, and those of the south northwards along the west. Within the equatorial zone certain areas, especially on the shores of the Gulf of Guinea and in the upper Nile basin, have an intensified rainfall, but this rarely approaches that of the rainiest regions of the world. The rainiest district in all Africa is a strip of coastland west of Mount Cameroon, where there is a mean annual rainfall of about as compared with a mean of at Cherrapunji, in Meghalaya, India.

The two distinct rainy seasons of the equatorial zone, where the sun is vertical at half-yearly intervals, become gradually merged into one in the direction of the tropics, where the sun is overhead but once. Snow falls on all the higher mountain ranges, and on the highest the climate is thoroughly Alpine.

The countries bordering the Sahara are much exposed to a very dry wind, full of fine particles of sand, blowing from the desert towards the sea. Known in Egypt as the khamsin, on the Mediterranean as the sirocco, it is called on the Guinea coast the harmattan. This wind is not invariably hot; its great dryness causes so much evaporation that cold is not infrequently the result. Similar dry winds blow from the Kalahari Desert in the south. On the eastern coast the monsoons of the Indian Ocean are regularly felt, and on the southeast hurricanes are occasionally experienced.

==Health==
The climate of Africa lends itself to certain environmental diseases, the most serious of which are: malaria, sleeping sickness and yellow fever. Malaria is the most deadly environmental disease in Africa. It is transmitted by a genus of mosquito (anopheles mosquito) native to Africa, and can be contracted over and over again. There is not yet a vaccine for malaria, which makes it difficult to prevent the disease from spreading in Africa. Recently, the dissemination of mosquito netting has helped lower the rate of malaria.

Yellow fever is a disease also transmitted by mosquitoes native to Africa. Unlike malaria, it cannot be contracted more than once. Like chicken pox, it is a disease that tends to be severe the later in life a person contracts the disease.

Sleeping sickness, or African trypanosomiasis, is a disease that usually affects animals, but has been known to be fatal to some humans as well. It is transmitted by the tsetse fly and is found almost exclusively in Sub-Saharan Africa. This disease has had a significant impact on African development not because of its deadly nature, like Malaria, but because it has prevented Africans from pursuing agriculture (as the sleeping sickness would kill their livestock).

<text>Approval voting is a single-winner rated voting system where voters can approve of as many candidates as they like, rather than being restricted to selecting only one. Each voter can cast a vote for every candidate they approve of, and the candidate with the most approval votes wins the election. This method is designed to allow voters to express their support for multiple candidates, while both using a simple ballot format and being easy to count.

Approval voting is used in various contexts, including organizational elections, some political elections, and academic settings. However, it is not as widely adopted as other voting systems like plurality voting or ranked-choice voting. Some organizations and political bodies have experimented with approval voting to improve representativeness and voter satisfaction.

The concept of approval voting has been discussed and analyzed by social choice theorists and mathematicians, and compared to other electoral systems. Theoretical analyses have shown that approval voting can lead to more satisfactory outcomes in certain scenarios, but its effectiveness can vary depending on the electoral context and voter behavior.

Critics of approval voting argue that it does not always reflect the true preferences of voters and may incentivize strategy, as well as hinder voters from fully expressing their preferences due to the simple ballot format.

== Effect on elections ==
Research by social choice theorists Steven Brams and Dudley R. Herschbach found that approval voting would increase voter participation, prevent minor-party candidates from being spoilers, and reduce negative campaigning. Brams&#x27; research concluded that approval can be expected to elect majority-preferred candidates in practical election scenarios, avoiding the center squeeze common to ranked-choice voting and primary elections.

One study showed that approval would not have chosen the same two winners as plurality voting (Jacques Chirac and Jean-Marie Le Pen) in the first round of the 2002 French presidential election; it instead would have chosen Chirac and Lionel Jospin as the top two candidates to proceed to the runoff.

In the actual election, Le Pen lost by an overwhelming margin in the runoff, 82.2% to 17.8%, a sign that the true top two candidates had not been found. In the approval voting survey primary, Chirac took first place with 36.7%, compared to Jospin at 32.9%. Le Pen, in that study, received 25.1% and so would not have made the cut to the second round. In the real primary election, the top three were Chirac, 19.9%, Le Pen, 16.9%, and Jospin, 16.2%. A study of various evaluative voting methods (approval and score voting) during the 2012 French presidential election showed that &quot;unifying&quot; candidates tended to do better, and polarizing candidates did worse, as compared to under plurality voting.

=== Operational impacts ===
* Simple to tally—Approval ballots can be counted by some existing machines designed for plurality elections, as ballots are cast, so that final tallies are immediately available after the election, with relatively few if any upgrades to equipment.
* Just one round—Approval can remove the need for multiple rounds of voting, such as a primary or a run-off, simplifying the election process.
* Avoids overvotes—Approval voting does not have the notion of overvotes, where voting for one more than allowed will cancel the entire opportunity to vote. In plurality elections, overvotes have to be reviewed and resolved if possible while in approval voting, no time is wasted on this activity.

== Usage ==

=== Current electoral use ===
====Latvia====
The Latvian parliament uses a modified version of approval voting within open list proportional representation, in which voters can cast either positive (approval) votes, negative votes or neither for any number of candidates.

====United States====
;Missouri
In November 2020, St. Louis, Missouri, passed Proposition D with 70% voting to authorize a variant of approval (unified primary) for municipal offices. In 2021, the first mayoral election with approval voting saw Tishaura Jones and Cara Spencer move on to the general with 57% and 46% support. Lewis Reed and Andrew Jones were eliminated with 39% and 14% support, resulting in an average of 1.6 candidates supported by each voter in the 4 person race.

;North Dakota
In 2018, Fargo, North Dakota, passed a local ballot initiative adopting approval for the city&#x27;s local elections, becoming the first United States city and jurisdiction to adopt approval. Previously in 2015, a Fargo city commissioner election had suffered from six-way vote-splitting, resulting in a candidate winning with an unconvincing 22% plurality of the vote.

The first election was held June 9, 2020, selecting two city commissioners, from seven candidates on the ballot. Both winners received over 50% approval, with an average 2.3 approvals per ballot, and 62% of voters supported the change to approval in a poll. A poll by opponents of approval was conducted to test whether voters had in fact voted strategically according to the Burr dilemma. They found that 30% of voters who bullet voted did so for strategic reasons, while 57% did so because it was their sincere opinion. Fargo&#x27;s second approval election took place in June 2022, for mayor and city commission. The incumbent mayor was re-elected from a field of 7 candidates, with an estimated 65% approval, with voters expressing 1.6 approvals per ballot, and the two commissioners were elected from a field of 15 candidates, with 3.1 approvals per ballot.

In 2023, the North Dakota legislature passed a bill which intended to ban approval voting. The bill was vetoed by governor Doug Burgum, citing the importance of &quot;home rule&quot; and allowing citizens control over their local government. The legislature attempted to overrule the veto but failed.

=== Use by organizations ===
Approval has been used in privately administered nomination contests by the Independent Party of Oregon in 2011, 2012, 2014, and 2016. Oregon is a fusion voting state, and the party has cross-nominated legislators and statewide officeholders using this method; its 2016 presidential preference primary did not identify a potential nominee due to no candidate earning more than 32% support. The party switched to using STAR voting in 2020.

It is also used in internal elections by the American Solidarity Party; the Green Parties of Texas and Ohio; the Libertarian National Committee; the Libertarian parties of Texas, Colorado, Arizona, and New York; Alliance 90/The Greens in Germany; and the Czech and German Pirate Party.

Approval has been adopted by several societies: the Society for Social Choice and Welfare (1992), Mathematical Association of America (1986), the American Mathematical Society, the Institute of Management Sciences (1987) (now the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences), the American Statistical Association (1987), and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (1987). 

Steven Brams&#x27; analysis of the 5-candidate 1987 Mathematical Association of America presidential election shows that 79% of voters cast a ballot for one candidate, 16% for 2 candidates, 5% for 3, and 1% for 4, with the winner earning the approval of 1,267 (32%) of 3,924 voters. The IEEE board in 2002 rescinded its decision to use approval. IEEE Executive Director Daniel J. Senese stated that approval was abandoned because &quot;few of our members were using it and it was felt that it was no longer needed.&quot;

Approval voting was used for Dartmouth Alumni Association elections for seats on the College Board of Trustees, but after some controversy it was replaced with traditional runoff elections by an alumni vote of 82% to 18% in 2009. Dartmouth students started to use approval voting to elect their student body president in 2011. In the first election, the winner secured the support of 41% of voters against several write-in candidates. In 2012, Suril Kantaria won with the support of 32% of the voters. In 2013, 2014 and 2016, the winners also earned the support of under 40% of the voters. Results reported in &quot;The Dartmouth&quot; show that in the 2014 and 2016 elections, more than 80 percent of voters approved of only one candidate. Students replaced approval voting with plurality voting before the 2017 elections.

===Historical===

Robert J. Weber coined the term &quot;Approval Voting&quot; in 1971. It was more fully published in 1978 by political scientist Steven Brams and mathematician Peter Fishburn.

Historically, several voting methods that incorporate aspects of approval have been used:

* Approval was used for papal conclaves between 1294 and 1621, with an average of about forty cardinals engaging in repeated rounds of voting until one candidate was listed on at least two-thirds of ballots.
* In the 13th through 18th centuries, the Republic of Venice elected the Doge of Venice using a multi-stage process that featured random selection and voting that allowed approval of multiple candidates.
* According to Steven J. Brams, approval was used for unspecified elections in 19th century England.
* The Secretary-General of the United Nations is elected in a multi-round straw poll process where, in each round, members of the Security Council may approve or disapprove of candidates, or decide to express no opinion. Disapproval by permanent members of the Security Council is similar to a veto. A candidate with no vetoes, at least nine votes, and more votes than any other candidate is considered to be likely to be supported by the Security Council in its formal recommendation vote.
*Approval was used in Greek legislative elections from 1864 to 1923, after which it was replaced with party-list proportional representation.
*Sequential proportional approval voting was used in Swedish elections in the early 20th century, prior to being replaced by party-list proportional representation.

The idea of approval was adopted by X. Hu and Lloyd Shapley in 2003 in studying authority distribution in organizations.

== Strategic voting ==
=== Overview ===

Approval voting allows voters to select all the candidates whom they consider to be reasonable choices.

&quot;Strategic approval&quot; differs from ranked voting (aka preferential voting) methods where voters are generally forced to &quot;reverse&quot; the preference order of two options, which if done on a larger scale can cause an unpopular candidate to win. Strategic approval, with more than two options, involves the voter changing their approval threshold. The voter decides which options to give the &quot;same&quot; rating, even if they were to have a preference order between them. This leaves a tactical concern any voter has for approving their second-favorite candidate, in the case that there are three or more candidates. Approving their second-favorite means the voter harms their favorite candidate&#x27;s chance to win. Not approving their second-favorite means the voter helps the candidate they least desire to beat their second-favorite and perhaps win.

Approval technically allows for but is strategically immune to push-over and burying.

Bullet voting occurs when a voter approves &quot;only&quot; candidate &quot;a&quot; instead of &quot;both&quot; &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; for the reason that voting for &quot;b&quot; can cause &quot;a&quot; to lose. The voter would be satisfied with either &quot;a&quot; or &quot;b&quot; but has a moderate preference for &quot;a&quot;. Were &quot;b&quot; to win, this hypothetical voter would still be satisfied. If supporters of both &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; do this, it could cause candidate &quot;c&quot; to win. This creates the &quot;chicken dilemma&quot;, as supporters of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are playing chicken as to which will stop strategic voting first, before both of these candidates lose.

Compromising occurs when a voter approves an &quot;additional&quot; candidate who is otherwise considered unacceptable to the voter to prevent an even worse alternative from winning.

=== Sincere voting ===

Approval experts describe sincere votes as those &quot;... that directly reflect the true preferences of a voter, i.e., that do not report preferences &#x27;falsely. They also give a specific definition of a sincere approval vote in terms of the voter&#x27;s ordinal preferences as being any vote that, if it votes for one candidate, it also votes for any more preferred candidate. This definition allows a sincere vote to treat strictly preferred candidates the same, ensuring that every voter has at least one sincere vote. The definition also allows a sincere vote to treat equally preferred candidates differently. When there are two or more candidates, every voter has at least three sincere approval votes to choose from. Two of those sincere approval votes do not distinguish between any of the candidates: vote for none of the candidates and vote for all of the candidates. When there are three or more candidates, every voter has more than one sincere approval vote that distinguishes between the candidates.

==== Examples ====

Based on the definition above, if there are four candidates, A, B, C, and D, and a voter has a strict preference order, preferring A to B to C to D, then the following are the voter&#x27;s possible sincere approval votes:
*vote for A, B, C, and D
*vote for A, B, and C
*vote for A and B
*vote for A
*vote for no candidates

If the voter instead equally prefers B and C, while A is still the most preferred candidate and D is the least preferred candidate, then all of the above votes are sincere and the following combination is also a sincere vote:
*vote for A and C

The decision between the above ballots is equivalent to deciding an arbitrary &quot;approval cutoff.&quot; All candidates preferred to the cutoff are approved, all candidates less preferred are not approved, and any candidates equal to the cutoff may be approved or not arbitrarily.

=== Sincere strategy with ordinal preferences ===

A sincere voter with multiple options for voting sincerely still has to choose which sincere vote to use. Voting strategy is a way to make that choice, in which case strategic approval includes sincere voting, rather than being an alternative to it. This differs from other voting systems that typically have a unique sincere vote for a voter.

When there are three or more candidates, the winner of an approval election can change, depending on which sincere votes are used. In some cases, approval can sincerely elect any one of the candidates, including a Condorcet winner and a Condorcet loser, without the voter preferences changing. To the extent that electing a Condorcet winner and not electing a Condorcet loser is considered desirable outcomes for a voting system, approval can be considered vulnerable to sincere, strategic voting. In one sense, conditions where this can happen are robust and are not isolated cases. On the other hand, the variety of possible outcomes has also been portrayed as a virtue of approval, representing the flexibility and responsiveness of approval, not just to voter ordinal preferences, but cardinal utilities as well.

==== Dichotomous preferences ====

Approval avoids the issue of multiple sincere votes in special cases when voters have dichotomous preferences. For a voter with dichotomous preferences, approval is strategyproof. When all voters have dichotomous preferences and vote the sincere, strategy-proof vote, approval is guaranteed to elect a Condorcet winner. However, having dichotomous preferences when there are three or more candidates is not typical. It is an unlikely situation for all voters to have dichotomous preferences when there are more than a few voters.

Having dichotomous preferences means that a voter has bi-level preferences for the candidates. All of the candidates are divided into two groups such that the voter is indifferent between any two candidates in the same group and any candidate in the top-level group is preferred to any candidate in the bottom-level group. A voter that has strict preferences between three candidates—prefers A to B and B to C—does not have dichotomous preferences.

Being strategy-proof for a voter means that there is a unique way for the voter to vote that is a strategically best way to vote, regardless of how others vote. In approval, the strategy-proof vote, if it exists, is a sincere vote.

==== Approval threshold ====

Another way to deal with multiple sincere votes is to augment the ordinal preference model with an approval or acceptance threshold. An approval threshold divides all of the candidates into two sets, those the voter approves of and those the voter does not approve of. A voter can approve of more than one candidate and still prefer one approved candidate to another approved candidate. Acceptance thresholds are similar. With such a threshold, a voter simply votes for every candidate that meets or exceeds the threshold.

With threshold voting, it is still possible to not elect the Condorcet winner and instead elect the Condorcet loser when they both exist. However, according to Steven Brams, this represents a strength rather than a weakness of approval. Without providing specifics, he argues that the pragmatic judgments of voters about which candidates are acceptable should take precedence over the Condorcet criterion and other social choice criteria.

=== Strategy with cardinal utilities ===

Voting strategy under approval is guided by two competing features of approval. On the one hand, approval fails the later-no-harm criterion, so voting for a candidate can cause that candidate to win instead of a candidate more preferred by that voter. On the other hand, approval satisfies the monotonicity criterion, so not voting for a candidate can never help that candidate win, but can cause that candidate to lose to a less preferred candidate. Either way, the voter can risk getting a less preferred election winner. A voter can balance the risk-benefit trade-offs by considering the voter&#x27;s cardinal utilities, particularly via the von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem, and the probabilities of how others vote.

A rational voter model described by Myerson and Weber specifies an approval strategy that votes for those candidates that have a positive prospective rating. This strategy is optimal in the sense that it maximizes the voter&#x27;s expected utility, subject to the constraints of the model and provided the number of other voters is sufficiently large.

An optimal approval vote always votes for the most preferred candidate and not for the least preferred candidate, which is a dominant strategy. An optimal vote can require supporting one candidate and not voting for a more preferred candidate if there 4 candidates or more, e.g. the third and fourth choices are correlated to gain or lose decisive votes together; however, such situations are inherently unstable, suggesting such strategy should be rare.

Other strategies are also available and coincide with the optimal strategy in special situations. For example:
* Vote for the candidates that have above average utility. This strategy coincides with the optimal strategy if the voter thinks that all pairwise ties are equally likely.
* Vote for any candidate that is more preferred than the expected winner and also vote for the expected winner if the expected winner is more preferred than the expected runner-up. This strategy coincides with the optimal strategy if there are three or fewer candidates or if the pivot probability for a tie between the expected winner and expected runner-up is sufficiently large compared to the other pivot probabilities. This strategy, if used by all voters, implies at equilibrium the election of the Condorcet winner whenever it exists.
*Vote for the most preferred candidate only. This strategy coincides with the optimal strategy when the best candidate is either much better than all others (i.e. is the only one with a positive expected value).
*If all voters are rational and cast a strategically optimal vote based on a common knowledge of how all other voters vote except for small-probability, statistically independent errors, then the winner will be the Condorcet winner, if one exists.

=== Strategy examples ===
In the example election described here, assume that the voters in each faction share the following von Neumann–Morgenstern utilities, fitted to the interval between 0 and 100. The utilities are consistent with the rankings given earlier and reflect a strong preference each faction has for choosing its city, compared to weaker preferences for other factors such as the distance to the other cities.

Using these utilities, voters choose their optimal strategic votes based on what they think the various pivot probabilities are for pairwise ties. In each of the scenarios summarized below, all voters share a common set of pivot probabilities.

In the first scenario, voters all choose their votes based on the assumption that all pairwise ties are equally likely. As a result, they vote for any candidate with an above-average utility. Most voters vote for only their first choice. Only the Knoxville faction also votes for its second choice, Chattanooga. As a result, the winner is Memphis, the Condorcet loser, with Chattanooga coming in second place. In this scenario, the winner has minority approval (more voters disapproved than approved) and all the others had even less support, reflecting the position that no choice gave an above-average utility to a majority of voters.

In the second scenario, all of the voters expect that Memphis is the likely winner, that Chattanooga is the likely runner-up, and that the pivot probability for a Memphis-Chattanooga tie is much larger than the pivot probabilities of any other pair-wise ties. As a result, each voter votes for any candidate they prefer more than the leading candidate, and also vote for the leading candidate if they prefer that candidate more than the expected runner-up. Each remaining scenario follows a similar pattern of expectations and voting strategies.

In the second scenario, there is a three-way tie for first place. This happens because the expected winner, Memphis, was the Condorcet loser and was also ranked last by any voter that did not rank it first.

Only in the last scenario does the actual winner and runner-up match the expected winner and runner-up. As a result, this can be considered a stable strategic voting scenario. In the language of game theory, this is an &quot;equilibrium.&quot; In this scenario, the winner is also the Condorcet winner.

===Dichotomous cutoff===

Modeling voters with a &#x27;dichotomous cutoff&#x27; assumes a voter has an immovable approval cutoff, while having meaningful cardinal preferences. This means that rather than voting for their top 3 candidates, or all candidates above the average approval, they instead vote for all candidates above a certain approval &#x27;cutoff&#x27; that they have decided. This cutoff does not change, regardless of which and how many candidates are running, so when all available alternatives are either above or below the cutoff, the voter votes for all or none of the candidates, despite preferring some over others. This could be imagined to reflect a case where many voters become disenfranchised and apathetic if they see no candidates they approve of. In a case such as this, many voters may have an internal cutoff, and would not simply vote for their top 3, or the above average candidates.

For example, in this scenario, voters are voting for candidates with approval above 50% (bold signifies that the voters voted for the candidate):

C wins with 65% of the voters&#x27; approval, beating B with 60%, D with 40% and A with 35%

If voters&#x27; threshold for receiving a vote is that the candidate has an above average approval, or they vote for their two most approved of candidates, this is not a dichotomous cutoff, as this can change if candidates drop out. On the other hand, if voters&#x27; threshold for receiving a vote is fixed (say 50%), this is a dichotomous cutoff, and satisfies IIA as shown below:
B now wins with 60%, beating C with 55% and D with 40%

With dichotomous cutoff, C still wins.
B now wins with 70%, beating C and A with 65%

With dichotomous cutoff, C still wins.

== Compliance with voting system criteria ==

Most of the mathematical criteria by which voting systems are compared were formulated for voters with ordinal preferences. In this case, approval voting requires voters to make an additional decision of where to put their approval cutoff (see examples above). Depending on how this decision is made, approval satisfies different sets of criteria.

There is no ultimate authority on which criteria should be considered, but the following are criteria that many voting theorists accept and consider desirable:

Some variants and generalizations of approval voting are:
* Multiwinner approval voting — multiple candidates may be elected, instead of just one.
* Fractional approval voting — the election outcome is a distribution - assigning a fraction to each candidate.
* Score voting (also called range voting) — is simply approval voting where voters can give a wider range of scores than 0 or 1 (e.g. 0-5 or 0–7).
* Combined approval voting — form of score voting with three levels that uses a scale of (-1, 0, +1) or (0, .5, 1).
* D21 – Janeček method — limited to two approval and one negative vote per voter.
* Unified primary — a nonpartisan primary that uses approval voting for the first round.

<text>Arizona State University (Arizona State or ASU) is a public research university in Tempe, Arizona, United States. Founded in 1885 as Territorial Normal School by the 13th Arizona Territorial Legislature, the university is one of the largest public universities by enrollment in the United States. It was one of about 180 &quot;normal schools&quot; founded in the late 19th century to train teachers for the rapidly growing public common schools. Some closed, but most steadily expanded their role and became state colleges in the early 20th century, then state universities in the late 20th century. 

One of three universities governed by the Arizona Board of Regents, Arizona State University is a member of the Association of American Universities (AAU) and is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very High Research Activity&quot;. ASU has over 183,000 students attending classes, with more than 74,000 students attending online, and 142,000 undergraduates and over 41,000 postgraduates across its four campuses and four regional learning centers throughout Arizona. ASU offers more than 400 undergraduate degree programs from its 16 colleges and over 170 cross-discipline centers and institutes for students. It also offers more than 450 graduate degree and certificate programs.

The Arizona State Sun Devils compete in 26 varsity-level sports in NCAA Division I as a member of the Big 12 Conference. Sun Devil teams have won 165 national championships, including 24 NCAA trophies. 179 Sun Devils have made Olympic teams, winning 60 Olympic medals: 25 gold, 12 silver and 23 bronze.

 ASU had more than 5,000 faculty members. This included 5 Nobel laureates, 11 MacArthur Fellows, 10 Pulitzer Prize winners, 11 National Academy of Engineering members, 26 National Academy of Sciences members, 28 American Academy of Arts and Sciences members, 41 Guggenheim fellows, 163 National Endowment for the Humanities fellows, and 289 Fulbright Program American Scholars.

==History==

===1885–1929===
Arizona State University was established as the Territorial Normal School at Tempe on March 12, 1885, when the 13th Arizona Territorial Legislature passed an act to create a normal school to train teachers for the Arizona Territory. The campus consisted of a single, four-room schoolhouse on a 20-acre plot largely donated by Tempe residents George and Martha Wilson. Classes began with 33 students on February 8, 1886. The curriculum evolved over the years and the name was changed several times; the institution was also known as Tempe Normal School of Arizona (1889–1903), Tempe Normal School (1903–1925), Tempe State Teachers College (1925–1929), Arizona State Teachers College (1929–1945), Arizona State College (1945–1958) and, by a 2–1 margin of the state&#x27;s voters, Arizona State University in 1958.

In 1923, the school stopped offering high school courses and added a high school diploma to the admissions requirements. In 1925, the school became the Tempe State Teachers College and offered four-year Bachelor of Education degrees as well as two-year teaching certificates. In 1929, the 9th Arizona State Legislature authorized Bachelor of Arts in Education degrees as well, and the school was renamed the Arizona State Teachers College. Under the 30-year tenure of president Arthur John Matthews (1900–1930), the school was given all-college student status. The first dormitories built in the state were constructed under his supervision in 1902. Of the 18 buildings constructed while Matthews was president, six are still in use. Matthews envisioned an &quot;evergreen campus&quot;, with many shrubs brought to the campus, and implemented the planting of 110 Mexican Fan Palms on what is now known as Palm Walk, a century-old landmark of the Tempe campus.

During the Great Depression, Ralph Waldo Swetman was hired to succeed President Matthews, coming to Arizona State Teachers College in 1930 from Humboldt State Teachers College where he had served as president. He served a three-year term, during which he focused on improving teacher-training programs. During his tenure, enrollment at the college doubled, topping the 1,000 mark for the first time. Matthews also conceived of a self-supported summer session at the school at Arizona State Teachers College, a first for the school.

===1930–1989===
In 1933, Grady Gammage, then president of Arizona State Teachers College at Flagstaff, became president of Arizona State Teachers College at Tempe, beginning a tenure that would last for nearly 28 years, second only to Swetman&#x27;s 30 years at the college&#x27;s helm. Like President Porter Eric Gasvoda before him, Gammage oversaw the construction of several buildings on the Tempe campus. He also guided the development of the university&#x27;s graduate programs; the first Master of Arts in Education was awarded in 1938, the first Doctor of Education degree in 1954 and 10 non-teaching master&#x27;s degrees were approved by the Arizona Board of Regents in 1956. During his presidency, the school&#x27;s name was changed to Arizona State College in 1945, and finally to Arizona State University in 1958. At the time, two other names were considered: Tempe University and State University at Tempe. Among Gammage&#x27;s greatest achievements in Tempe was the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed construction of what is Grady Gammage Memorial Auditorium/ASU Gammage. One of the university&#x27;s hallmark buildings, ASU Gammage was completed in 1964, five years after the president&#x27;s (and Wright&#x27;s) death.

Gammage was succeeded by Harold D. Richardson, who had served the school earlier in a variety of roles beginning in 1939, including director of graduate studies, college registrar, dean of instruction, dean of the College of Education and academic vice president. Although filling the role of acting president of the university for just nine months (Dec. 1959 to Sept. 1960), Richardson laid the groundwork for the future recruitment and appointment of well-credentialed research science faculty.

By the 1960s, under G. Homer Durham, the university&#x27;s 11th president, ASU began to expand its curriculum by establishing several new colleges and, in 1961, the Arizona Board of Regents authorized doctoral degree programs in six fields, including Doctor of Philosophy. By the end of his nine-year tenure, ASU had more than doubled enrollment, reporting 23,000 in 1969.

The next three presidents—Harry K. Newburn (1969–71), John W. Schwada (1971–81) and J. Russell Nelson (1981–89), including and Interim President Richard Peck (1989)—led the university to increased academic stature, the establishment of the ASU West Valley campus in 1984 and its subsequent construction in 1986, a focus on computer-assisted learning and research, and rising enrollment.

===1990–present===

Under the leadership of Lattie F. Coor, president from 1990 to 2002, ASU grew through the creation of the Polytechnic campus and extended education sites. Increased commitment to diversity, quality in undergraduate education, research, and economic development occurred over his 12-year tenure. Part of Coor&#x27;s legacy to the university was a successful fundraising campaign: through private donations, more than $500 million was invested in areas that would significantly impact the future of ASU. Among the campaign&#x27;s achievements were the naming and endowing of Barrett, The Honors College, and the Herberger Institute for Design and the Arts; the creation of many new endowed faculty positions; and hundreds of new scholarships and fellowships.
In 2002, Michael M. Crow became the university&#x27;s 16th president. At his inauguration, he outlined his vision for transforming ASU into a &quot;New American University&quot;—one that would be open and inclusive, and set a goal for the university to meet Association of American Universities criteria and to become a member. Crow initiated the idea of transforming ASU into &quot;One university in many places&quot;—a single institution comprising several campuses, sharing students, faculty, staff and accreditation. Subsequent reorganizations combined academic departments, consolidated colleges and schools, and reduced staff and administration as the university expanded its West Valley and Polytechnic campuses. ASU&#x27;s Downtown Phoenix campus was also expanded, with several colleges and schools relocating there. The university established learning centers throughout the state, including the ASU Colleges at Lake Havasu City and programs in Thatcher, Yuma, and Tucson. Students at these centers can choose from several ASU degree and certificate programs.

During Crow&#x27;s tenure, and aided by hundreds of millions of dollars in donations, ASU began a years-long research facility capital building effort that led to the establishment of the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, the Julie Ann Wrigley Global Institute of Sustainability, and several large interdisciplinary research buildings. Along with the research facilities, the university faculty was expanded, including the addition of five Nobel Laureates. Since 2002, the university&#x27;s research expenditures have tripled and more than 1.5 million square feet of space has been added to the university&#x27;s research facilities.

The economic downturn that began in 2008 took a particularly hard toll on Arizona, resulting in large cuts to ASU&#x27;s budget. In response to these cuts, ASU capped enrollment, closed some four dozen academic programs, combined academic departments, consolidated colleges and schools, and reduced university faculty, staff and administrators; with an economic recovery underway in 2011, however, the university continued its campaign to expand the West Valley and Polytechnic Campuses, and establish a low-cost, teaching-focused extension campus in Lake Havasu City. As of 2011, an article in &quot;Slate&quot; reported that, &quot;the bottom line looks good&quot;, noting that: 

On May 1, 2014, ASU was listed as one of fifty-five higher education institutions under investigation by the Office of Civil Rights &quot;for possible violations of federal law over the handling of sexual violence and harassment complaints&quot; by Barack Obama&#x27;s White House Task Force To Protect Students from Sexual Assault. The publicly announced investigation followed two Title IX suits. In July 2014, a group of at least nine current and former students who alleged they were harassed or assaulted asked the federal investigation be expanded.
In August 2014 ASU president Michael Crow appointed a task force comprising faculty and staff, students, and members of the university police force to review the university&#x27;s efforts to address sexual violence. Crow accepted the recommendations of the task force in November 2014.

In 2015, the Thunderbird School of Global Management became the Thunderbird School of Global Management at ASU. Partnerships for education and research with Mayo Clinic established collaborative degree programs in health care and law, and shared administrator positions, laboratories and classes at the Mayo Clinic Arizona campus.

The Beus Center for Law and Society, the new home of ASU&#x27;s Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor College of Law, opened in fall 2016 on the Downtown Phoenix campus, relocating faculty and students from the Tempe campus to the state capital.

In September 2024, ASU announced several cuts in response to state budget cuts, including the closure of the Lake Havasu City campus, a reduction of the Arizona Teachers Academy and the addition of a &quot;tuition surcharge.&quot;

==Organization and administration==


The Arizona Board of Regents (ABOR) governs Arizona State University as well as the state&#x27;s other public universities; University of Arizona and Northern Arizona University. The board is composed of 12 members including 11 who are voting members, and one non-voting member. Members of the board include the state governor and superintendent of public instruction acting as ex-officio members, eight volunteer Regents members with eight-year terms who are appointed by the governor, and two student regents, each with two-year terms, and each serving a one-year term as non-voting apprentices. ABOR provides policy guidance to the state universities of Arizona. ASU has four campuses in metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona, including the Tempe campus in Tempe; the West Valley campus in Glendale; the Downtown Phoenix campus; and the Polytechnic campus in Mesa. ASU also offers courses and degrees through ASU Online and at the ASU Colleges at Lake Havasu City in western Arizona, and offers regional learning programs in Thatcher, Yuma and Tucson.

The Arizona Board of Regents appoints and elects the president of the university, who is considered the institution&#x27;s chief executive officer and the chief budget officer. The president executes measures enacted by the Board of Regents, controls the university&#x27;s property, and acts as the university&#x27;s official representative to the Board of Regents. The chief executive officer is assisted through the administration of the institution by the provost, vice presidents, deans, faculty, directors, department chairs, and other officers. The president also selects and appoints administrative officers and general counsels. The 16th ASU president is Michael M. Crow, who has served since July 1, 2002.

==Campuses and locations==
ASU has four campuses and four regional learning centers throughout Arizona, and campuses located in Los Angeles, Washington, D.C. and Hawaii. Unlike most multi-campus institutions, however, ASU describes itself as &quot;one university in many places&quot;, inferring there is &quot;not a system with separate campuses, and not one main campus with branch campuses&quot;. The university considers each campus &quot;distinctive&quot; and academically focused on certain aspects of the overall university mission. The Tempe campus is the university&#x27;s research and graduate school center. Undergraduate studies on the Tempe campus are research-based programs that prepare students for graduate school, professional school, or employment. The Polytechnic campus is designed with an emphasis on professional and technological programs for direct workforce preparation. The Polytechnic campus is the site of many of the university&#x27;s simulators and laboratories dedicated for project-based learning. The West Valley campus is focused on interdisciplinary degrees and the liberal arts, while maintaining professional programs with a direct impact on the community and society. The Downtown Phoenix campus focuses on direct urban and public programs such as nursing, public policy, criminal justice, mass communication, and journalism. ASU recently relocated some nursing and health related programs to its new ASU-Mayo Medical School campus. Inter-campus shuttles and light rail allow students and faculty to easily travel between the campuses. In addition to the physical campuses, ASU&#x27;s &quot;virtual campus&quot; at the university&#x27;s SkySong Innovation Center, provides online and extended education.

In 2018, the Arizona Board of Regents reported that the ASU facilities inventory totaled more than 23 million gross square feet.

===Tempe campus===
ASU&#x27;s Tempe campus is in downtown Tempe, Arizona, about east of downtown Phoenix. The campus is considered urban, and is approximately in size. It is arranged around broad pedestrian malls and is completely encompassed by an arboretum. The Tempe campus is also the largest of ASU&#x27;s campuses, with more than 70,000 students enrolled in at least one class on campus in fall 2017. The campus is considered to range from the streets Rural Road on the east to Mill Avenue on the west, and Apache Boulevard on the south to Rio Salado Parkway on the north.

The Tempe campus is ASU&#x27;s original campus, and Old Main, the oldest building on campus, still stands. Today&#x27;s university and the Tempe campus were founded as the Territorial Normal School when first constructed, and was originally a teachers college. There are many notable landmarks on campus, including Grady Gammage Memorial Auditorium, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright; Palm Walk, which is lined by 111 palm trees; Charles Trumbull Hayden Library; the University Club building; Margaret Gisolo Dance Theatre; Arizona State University Art Museum; and University Bridge. Furthermore, the Tempe campus is home to Barrett, The Honors College. In addition, the campus has an extensive public art collection; It was named &quot;the single most impressive venue for contemporary art in Arizona&quot; by &quot;Art in America&quot; magazine. Against the northwest edge of campus is the Mill Avenue district (part of downtown Tempe), which has a college atmosphere that attracts many students to its restaurants and bars. Students also have Tempe Marketplace, a shopping, dining and entertainment center with an outdoor setting near the northeast border of the campus. The Tempe campus is also home to all of the university&#x27;s athletic facilities.

===West Valley campus===

Established in 1984 by the Arizona legislature, the West Valley campus sits on in a suburban area of northwest Phoenix. The West Valley campus lies about northwest of Downtown Phoenix, and about northwest of the Tempe campus. The West Valley campus is designated as a Phoenix Point of Pride and is nearly completely powered by a solar array. The campus serves more than 4,000 students enrolled in at least a single course and offers more than 100 degree programs from the New College of Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences, the Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College, W. P. Carey School of Business, College of Public Service and Community Solutions, College of Health Solutions, and the College of Nursing and Health Innovation.

P. Carey School of Business/Morrison School of Management and Agribusiness, Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College, Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering, and College of Integrative Sciences and Arts. The campus — a desert arboretum — includes outdoor learning labs and spaces as well as leading-edge simulators and indoor lab spaces to support teaching and research in various fields of study. The campus is in southeast Mesa, Arizona, approximately southeast of the Tempe campus, and southeast of downtown Phoenix. The Polytechnic campus sits on the former Williams Air Force Base and is adjacent to the Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport and Chandler-Gilbert Community College (Williams campus).

===Downtown Phoenix campus===

The Downtown Phoenix campus was established in 2006 on the north side of Downtown Phoenix. The campus has an urban design, with several large modern academic buildings intermingled with commercial and retail office buildings. In addition to the new buildings, the campus included the adaptive reuse of several existing structures, including a 1930s era Post Office that is on the National Register of Historic Places. Serving 11,465 students, the campus houses the College of Health Solutions, College of Integrative Science and Arts, College of Nursing and Health Innovation, Watts College of Public Service &amp; Community Solutions, Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College, and Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication. In 2013, the campus added the Sun Devil Fitness Center in conjunction with the original YMCA building. ASU&#x27;s Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor College of Law relocated from Tempe to the Downtown Phoenix campus in 2016.

===ASU Colleges at Lake Havasu City===

In response to demands for lower-cost public higher education in Arizona, ASU developed the small, undergraduate-only college in Lake Havasu City. ASU Colleges are teaching-focused and provide a selection of popular undergraduate majors. The Lake Havasu City campus offers undergraduate degrees at lower tuition rates than other Arizona research universities and a 15-to-1 student-to-faculty ratio. In September 2024, ASU announced that the campus would close in June 2025 in response to state budget cuts.

===ASU Online===
ASU Online offers more than 150 undergraduate and graduate degree programs through an online platform. The degree programs delivered online hold the same accreditation as the university&#x27;s traditional face-to-face programs. ASU Online is headquartered at ASU&#x27;s SkySong campus in Scottsdale, Arizona. ASU Online was ranked in the Top 4 for Best Online Bachelor&#x27;s Programs by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.

Online students are taught by the same faculty and receive the same diploma as on-campus students. ASU online programs allow students to learn in highly interactive environments through student collaboration and through technological personalized learning environments.

In April 2015, ASU Online announced a partnership with edX to form a one of a kind program called the Global Freshman Academy. The program is open to all potential students. The students do not need to submit a high school transcript or GPA to apply for the courses.

As of spring 2017, more than 25,000 students were enrolled through ASU Online. In June 2014, ASU Online and Starbucks announced a partnership called the Starbucks College Achievement Plan. The Starbucks College Achievement Plan offers all benefits-eligible employees full-tuition coverage when they enroll in any one of ASU Online&#x27;s undergraduate degree programs.

===Mayo Clinic School of Medicine, in collaboration with ASU===
In 2016, Mayo Clinic and ASU formed a new platform for health care education and research: the Mayo Clinic and Arizona State University Alliance for Health Care. Beginning in 2017, Mayo Clinic School of Medicine students in Phoenix and Scottsdale are among the first to earn a certificate in the Science of Health Care Delivery, with the option to earn a master&#x27;s degree in the Science of Health Care Delivery through ASU.

===Thunderbird Campus===

Thunderbird School of Global Management is one of the newest units of &quot;Arizona State University Knowledge Enterprise.&quot; The flagship campus was in Glendale, Arizona, at Thunderbird Field No. 1, a former military airfield from which it derives its name, until 2018 when the Thunderbird School relocated to the Downtown area.

===Barrett and O&#x27;Connor Center===
Following a nearly 15-year presence in Washington, D.C., through more minor means, ASU opened the Barrett and O&#x27;Connor Center in 2018 to solidify the university&#x27;s contacts with the capital city. The center houses ASU&#x27;s D.C.-based academic programs, including the Washington Bureau of the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication, the Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor College of Law Rule of Law and Governance program, the Capital Scholars program, and the McCain Institute&#x27;s Next Generation Leaders program, among many others. In addition to hosting classes and internships on-site, special lectures and seminars taught from the Barrett &amp; O&#x27;Connor Washington Center are connected to classrooms in Arizona through video-conferencing technology. The Barrett and O&#x27;Connor center is located at 1800 I St NW, Washington, DC 20006, close to the White House.

===ASU California===
ASU operates its &quot;California Center&quot; in Los Angeles at the Herald Examiner Building. The center offers undergraduate and graduate degree programs, executive education, workshops and seminars. In 2022, ASU acquired a small nonprofit college, Columbia College Hollywood, and renamed it California College of ASU. In 2023, ASU reached an agreement with the for-profit Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising to take over some of its academic programs, creating ASU FIDM.

==Academics==
===Admissions===

As of August 2022, ASU had a systemwide enrolled student population (both in-person and online) of 140,759, a 4% increase over the systemwide total in 2021. Out of that total, approximately 79,000 students were enrolled in-person at one of the ASU campuses, an increase of 3.2% from 2021. Just over 61,000 students were enrolled in ASU Online courses and programs as of August 2022, an increase of roughly 7% in online student enrollment from the previous year.

According to the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, for the 2022–2023 academic year ASU admitted 88% of all freshman applicants and classified the school&#x27;s admissions in the “selective” category. The average high school GPA of incoming first-year students for the 2022–23 academic year was 3.54.

Barrett, The Honors College is ranked among the top honors programs in the nation. Although there are no set minimum admissions criteria for Barrett College, the average GPA of Fall 2017 incoming freshmen was 3.78, with an average SAT score of 1380 and an average ACT score of 29. The Honors college has 7,236 students, with 719 National Merit Scholars.

ASU enrolls 10,268 international students, 14.3% of the total student population. The international student body represents more than 150 nations. The Institute of International Education ranked ASU as the top public university in the U.S. for hosting international students in 2016–2017.

In June 2022, Arizona State University was designated a Hispanic-serving institution (HSI) by the United States Department of Education in recognition of the fact that for the first time in the school&#x27;s history, during the Fall Semester of 2021 Hispanic students comprised over 25% of the university&#x27;s total undergraduate enrollment.

===Research and Institutes===
ASU is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very High Research Activity&quot;. The university spent $673 million in fiscal year 2020, ranking it 43rd nationally. ASU is a NASA designated national space-grant institute and a member of the Universities Research Association. In 2023, it became a member of the Association of American Universities, an elite organization of 71 research universities in the U.S. and Canada. The university is currently in the top 10 for NASA-funded research expenditures.

The university has raised more than $999 million in external funding, and more than 180 companies based on ASU innovations have been launched through the university&#x27;s exclusive intellectual property management company, Skysong Innovations. The U.S. National Academy of Inventors and the Intellectual Property Owners Association rank ASU in the top 10 nationally and No. 11 globally for U.S. patents awarded to universities in 2020, along with MIT, Stanford and Harvard. ASU jumped to 10th place from 17th in 2017, according to the U.S. National Academy of Inventors and the Intellectual Property Owners Association. Since its inception, Skysong Innovations has fostered the launch of more than 180 companies based on ASU innovations, and attracted more than $999 million in venture funding, including $96 million in fiscal year 2016 alone. In 2013, the Sweden-based University Business Incubator (UBI) Index, named ASU as one of the top universities in the world for business incubation, ranking 17th. UBI reviewed 550 universities and associated business incubators from around the world using an assessment framework that takes more than 50 performance indicators into consideration. As an example, one of ASU&#x27;s spin-offs (Heliae Development, LLC) raised more than $28 million in venture capital in 2013 alone. In June 2016, ASU received the Entrepreneurial University Award from the Deshpande Foundation, a philanthropic organization that supports social entrepreneurship and innovation.

The university&#x27;s push to create various institutes has led to greater funding and an increase in the number of researchers in multiple fields. ASU Knowledge Enterprise (KE) advances research, innovation, strategic partnerships, entrepreneurship, economic development and international development. KE is led by Sally C. Morton. KE supports several interdisciplinary research institutes and initiatives. Other notable and famed institutes at ASU are The Institute of Human Origins, L. William Seidman Research Institute (W. P. Carey School of Business), Learning Sciences Institute, Herberger Research Institute, and the Hispanic Research Center. The Biodesign Institute for instance, conducts research on issues such as biomedical and health care outcomes as part of a collaboration with Mayo Clinic to diagnose and treat diseases. The institute has attracted more than $760 million in external funding, filed 860 invention disclosures, nearly 200 patents, and generated 35 spinout companies based on its research. In the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, Biodesign developed a rapid, saliva-based testing option for the university community, and partnered with the Arizona Department of Health Services to make the saliva-based COVID test available to the public. In October 2021, Biodesign announced their millionth test. The institute also is heavily involved in sustainability research, primarily through reuse of CO2 via biological feedback and various biomasses (e.g. algae) to synthesize clean biofuels. Heliae is a Biodesign Institute spin-off and much of its business centers on algal-derived, high value products. Furthermore, the institute is heavily involved in security research including technology that can detect biological and chemical changes in the air and water. The university has received more than $30 million in funding from the Department of Defense for adapting this technology for use in detecting the presence of biological and chemical weapons. Research conducted at the Biodesign Institute by ASU professor Charles Arntzen made possible the production of Ebola antibodies in specially modified tobacco plants that researchers at Mapp Biopharmaceutical used to create the Ebola therapeutic ZMapp. The treatment is credited with saving the lives of two aid workers. For his work, Arntzen was named the No. 1 honoree among Fast Company&#x27;s annual &quot;100 Most Creative People in Business&quot; 2015 awards.

World-renowned scholars have been integral to the successes of the institutes associated with the university. ASU students and researchers have been selected as Marshall, Truman, Rhodes, and Fulbright Scholars with the university ranking 1st overall in the U.S. for Fulbright Scholar awards to faculty and 5th overall for recipients of Fulbright U.S. Student awards in the 2015–2016 academic year. ASU faculty includes Nobel Laureates, Royal Society members, National Academy members, and members of the National Institutes of Health, to name a few. ASU Professor Donald Johanson, who discovered the 3.18 million year old fossil hominid Lucy (Australopithecus) in Ethiopia, established the Institute of Human Origins (IHO) in 1981. The institute was first established in Berkeley, California, and later moved to ASU in 1997. As one of the leading research organization in the United States devoted to the science of human origins, IHO pursues a transdisciplinary strategy for field and analytical paleoanthropological research. The Herberger Institute Research Center supports the scholarly inquiry, applied research and creative activity of more than 400 faculty and nearly 5,000 students. The renowned ASU Art Museum, Herberger Institute Community Programs, urban design, and other outreach and initiatives in the arts community round out the research and creative activities of the Herberger Institute. Among well known professors within the Herberger Institute is Johnny Saldaña of the School of Theatre and Film. Saldaña received the 1996 Distinguished Book Award and the prestigious Judith Kase Cooper Honorary Research Award, both from the American Alliance for Theatre Education (AATE). The Julie Ann Wrigley Global Institute of Sustainability is the center of ASU&#x27;s initiatives focusing on practical solutions to environmental, economic, and social challenges. The institute has partnered with various cities, universities, and organizations from around the world to address issues affecting the global community.

ASU is also involved with NASA in the field of space exploration. To meet the needs of NASA programs, ASU built the LEED Gold Certified, 298,000-square-foot Interdisciplinary Science and Technology Building IV (ISTB 4) at a cost of $110 million in 2012. The building includes space for the School of Earth and Space Exploration (SESE) and includes labs and other facilities for the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering. One of the main projects at ISTB 4 includes the OSIRIS-REx Thermal Emission Spectrometer (OTES). Although ASU built the spectrometers aboard the Martian rovers Spirit and Opportunity, OTES will be the first major scientific instrument completely designed and built at ASU for a NASA space mission. Phil Christensen, the principal investigator for the Mars Global Surveyor Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES), is a Regents&#x27; Professor at ASU. He also serves as the principal investigator for the Mars Odyssey THEMIS instruments, as well as co-investigator for the Mars Exploration Rovers. ASU scientists are responsible for the Mini-TES instruments aboard the Mars Exploration Rovers. The Buseck Center for Meteorite Studies, which is home to rare Martian meteorites and exotic fragments from space, and the Mars Space Flight Facility are on ASU&#x27;s Tempe campus. In 2017, Lindy Elkins-Tanton of ASU was selected by NASA to lead a deep space mission to Psyche, a metal asteroid believed to be a former planetary core. The $450 million project is the first NASA mission led by the university.

The Army Research Laboratory extended funding for the Arizona State University Flexible Display Center (FDC) in 2009 with a $50 million grant. The university has partnered with the Pentagon on such endeavors since 2004 with an initial $43.7 million grant. In 2012, researchers at the center created the world&#x27;s largest flexible full-color organic light-emitting diode (OLED), which at the time was 7.4 inches. The following year, the FEDC staff broke their own world record, producing a 14.7-inch version of the display. The technology delivers high-performance while remaining cost-effective during the manufacturing process. Vibrant colors, high switching speeds for video and reduced power consumption are some of the features the center has integrated into the technology. In 2012, ASU eliminated the need for specialized equipment and processing, thereby reducing costs compared to competitive approaches.

===Luminosity Lab===
The Luminosity Lab is a student-led research and development think tank located on the Tempe campus of ASU. It was founded in 2016 by Dr. Mark Naufel. Fifteen students from multiple disciplines were selected for the initial team.
===Libraries===
ASU&#x27;s faculty and students are served by nine libraries across five campuses: Hayden Library, Noble Library, Music Library and Design and the Arts Library on the Tempe campus; Fletcher Library on the West campus; Downtown Phoenix campus library and Ross-Blakley Law Library at the Downtown Phoenix campus; Polytechnic campus library; and the Thunderbird Library at the Thunderbird campus.

, ASU&#x27;s libraries held 4.5 million volumes. The Arizona State University library system is ranked the 34th largest research library in the United States and Canada, according to criteria established by the Association of Research Libraries that measures various aspects of quality and size of the collection. The university continues to grow its special collections, such as the recent addition of a privately held collection of manuscripts by poet Rubén Darío.

Hayden Library is on Cady Mall in the center of the Tempe campus and is currently under renovation. It opened in 1966 and is the largest library facility at ASU. An expansion in 1989 created the subterranean entrance underneath Hayden Lawn and is attached to the above-ground portion of the original library. There are two floors underneath Hayden Lawn with a landmark known as the &quot;Beacon of Knowledge&quot; rising from the center. The underground library lights the beacon at night.

The 2013 Capital Improvement Plan, approved by the Arizona Board of Regents, incorporates a $35 million repurposing and renovation project for Hayden Library. The open air moat area that serves as an outdoor study space will be enclosed to increase indoor space for the library. Along with increasing space and renovating the facility, the front entrance of Hayden Library was rebuilt.

==Sustainability==

, ASU was the top institution of higher education in the United States for solar generating capacity. Today, the university generates over 24 megawatts (MW) of electricity from on-campus solar arrays. This is an increase over the June 2012 total of 15.3 MW. ASU has 88 solar photovoltaic (PV) installations containing 81,424 solar panels across four campuses and the ASU Research Park. An additional 29 MWdc solar installation was dedicated at Red Rock, Pinal County, Arizona, in January 2017, bringing the university&#x27;s solar generating capacity to 50 MWdc.

Additionally, six wind turbines installed on the roof of the Julie Ann Wrigley Global Institute of Sustainability building on the Tempe campus have operated since October 2008. Under normal conditions, the six turbines produce enough electricity to power approximately 36 computers.

In 2021, ASU researchers installed a passive radiative cooling film to local Tempe bus shelters to cool temperatures during the daytime by radiating heat to space with zero energy use. The film was produced by 3M and cooled shelter temperatures by 4 °C. It was one of the first applications of the cooling film in the country.

ASU&#x27;s School of Sustainability was the first school in the United States to introduce degrees in the field of sustainability. ASU&#x27;s School of Sustainability is part of the Wrigley Global Institute of Sustainability. The School was established in spring 2007 and began enrolling undergraduates in fall 2008. The school offers majors, minors, and a number of certificates in sustainability. ASU is also home to the Sustainability Consortium, which was founded by Jay Golden in 2009.

The School of Sustainability has been essential in establishing the university as &quot;a leader in the academics of sustainable business&quot;. The university is widely considered to be one of the most ambitious and principled organizations for embedding sustainable practices into its operating model. The university has embraced several challenging sustainability goals. Among the numerous benchmarks outlined in the university&#x27;s prospectus, is the creation of a large recycling and composting operation that will eliminate 30% and divert 90% of waste from landfills. This endeavor will be aided by educating students about the benefits of avoiding overconsumption that contributes to excessive waste. Sustainability courses have been expanded to attain this goal and many of the university&#x27;s individual colleges and schools have integrated such material into their lectures and courses. Second, ASU is on track to reduce its rate of water consumption by 50%. The university&#x27;s most aggressive benchmark is to be the first, large research university to achieve carbon neutrality as it pertains to its Scope 1, 2 and non-transportation Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

ASU&#x27;s College of Integrative Sciences and Arts (CISA) offers degrees and certifications focused on sustainable horticulture, natural resource ecology, indoor farming, desert food production and wildlife management, through its College of Applied Sciences and Arts at ASU&#x27;s Polytechnic campus. CISA&#x27;s Burrowing Owl Conservation Project at the Polytechnic campus was noted as one of the distinctive features of ASU in The Sierra Club magazine&#x27;s ranking of ASU as the top &quot;cool school&quot; for sustainability in 2021.

CISA faculty at the Polytechnic campus in disciplines such as applied biological sciences, and technical communication and user experience, are involved in research and community outreach to promote sustainable use of resources and preservation of species and habitat. Vertical farming, indoor farming and water conservation efforts are just a few of the sustainability initiatives being driven by CISA faculty.

==Traditions==
===Maroon and gold===
Gold is the oldest color associated with Arizona State University and dates back to 1896 when the school was named the Tempe Normal School. Maroon and white were later added to the color scheme in 1898. Gold signifies the &quot;golden promise&quot; of ASU. The promise includes every student receiving a valuable educational experience. Gold also signifies the sunshine Arizona is famous for; including the power of the sun and its influence on the climate and the economy. The first uniforms worn by athletes associated with the university were black and white when the &quot;Normals&quot; were the name of the athletic teams. The student section, known as The Inferno, wears gold on game days. Maroon signifies sacrifice and bravery while white represents the balance of negativity and positivity. As it is in the city of Tempe, Arizona, the school&#x27;s colors adorn the neighboring buildings during big game days and festive events.

===Mascot and Spirit Squad===

Sparky the Sun Devil is the mascot of Arizona State University and was named by vote of the student body on November 8, 1946. Sparky often travels with the team across the country and has been at every football bowl game in which the university has participated. The university&#x27;s mascot is not to be confused with the athletics department&#x27;s logo, the &quot;Pitchfork&quot; or hand gesture used by those associated with the university. The new logo is used on various sport facilities, uniforms and athletics documents. Arizona State Teacher&#x27;s College had a different mascot and the sports teams were known as the Owls and later, the Bulldogs. When the school was first established, the Tempe Normal School&#x27;s teams were simply known as the Normals. Sparky is visible on the sidelines of every home game played in Sun Devil Stadium or other ASU athletic facilities. His routine at football games includes pushups after every touchdown scored by the Sun Devils. He is aided by Sparky&#x27;s Crew, male yell leaders that must meet physical requirements to participate as members. The female members are known as the Spirit Squad and are categorized into a dance line and spirit line. They are the official squad that represents ASU. The spirit squad competes every year at the ESPN Universal Dance Association (UDA) College Nationals in the Jazz and Hip-Hop categories. They were chosen by the UDA to represent the US at the World Dance Championship 2013 in the Jazz category.

===&quot;A&quot; Mountain===

A letter has existed on the slope of the mountain since 1918. A &quot;T&quot; followed by an &quot;N&quot; were the first letters to grace the landmark. Tempe Butte, home to &quot;A&quot; Mountain, has had the &quot;A&quot; installed on the slope of its south face since 1938 and is visible from campus just to the south. The original &quot;A&quot; was destroyed by vandals in 1952 with pipe bombs and a new &quot;A&quot;, constructed of reinforced concrete, was built in 1955. The vandals were never identified but many speculate the conspirators were students from the rival in-state university (University of Arizona). Many ancient Hohokam petroglyphs were destroyed by the bomb; nevertheless, many of these archeological sites around the mountain remain. There are many traditions surrounding &quot;A&quot; Mountain, including a revived &quot;guarding of the &#x27;A&#x27;&quot; in which students camp on the mountainside before games with rival schools. &quot;Whitewashing&quot; of the &quot;A&quot; is a tradition in which incoming freshmen paint the letter white during orientation week and is repainted gold before the first football game of the season. Whitewashing dates back to the 1930s and it grows in popularity every year, with thousands of students going up to paint the &quot;A&quot; every year.

===Lantern Walk and Homecoming===

The Lantern Walk is one of the oldest traditions at ASU and dates back to 1917. It is considered one of ASU&#x27;s &quot;most cherished&quot; traditions and is an occasion used to mark the work of those associated with ASU throughout history. Anyone associated with ASU is free to participate in the event, including students, alumni, faculty, employees, and friends. This differs slightly from the original tradition in which the seniors would carry lanterns up &quot;A&quot; Mountain followed by the freshman. The senior class president would describe ASU&#x27;s traditions and the freshman would repeat an oath of allegiance to the university. It was described as a tradition of &quot;good will between the classes&quot; and a way of ensuring new students would continue the university&#x27;s traditions with honor. In modern times, the participants walk through campus and follow a path up to &quot;A&quot; Mountain to &quot;light up&quot; Tempe. Keynote speakers, performances, and other events are used to mark the occasion. The night is culminated with a fireworks display. The Lantern Walk was held after the Spring Semester (June) but is now held the week before Homecoming, a tradition that dates to 1924 at ASU. It is held in the fall and in conjunction with a football game.

===Victory Bell===

In 2012, Arizona State University reintroduced the tradition of ringing a bell after each win for the football team. The ROTC cadets associated with the university transport the bell to various events and ring it after Sun Devil victories. The first Victory Bell, in various forms, was used in the 1930s but the tradition faded in the 1970s when the bell was removed from Memorial Union for renovations. The bell cracked and was no longer capable of ringing. That bell is on the southeast corner of Sun Devil Stadium, near the entrance to the student section. That bell, given to the university in the late 1960s, is painted gold and is a campus landmark.

===Sun Devil Marching Band, Devil Walk and songs of the university===
The Arizona State University Sun Devil Marching Band, created in 1915 and known as the &quot;Pride of the Southwest&quot;, was the first of only two marching bands in the Pac-12 to receive the prestigious Sudler Trophy. The John Philip Sousa Foundation awarded the band the trophy in 1991. The Sun Devil Marching Band remains one of only 28 bands in the nation to have earned the designation. The band performs at every football game played in Sun Devil Stadium. In addition, the Sun Devil Marching Band has made appearances in the Fiesta Bowl, the Rose Bowl, the Holiday Bowl, and the Super Bowl XLII, in addition to many others. Smaller ensembles of band members perform at other sport venues including basketball games at Wells Fargo Arena and baseball games. The Devil Walk is held in Wells Fargo Arena by the football team and involves a more formal introduction of the players to the community; a new approach to the tradition added in 2012 with the arrival of head coach Todd Graham. It begins 2 hours and 15 minutes prior to the game and allows the players to establish rapport with the fans. The walk ends as the team passes the band and fans lined along the path to Sun Devil Stadium. The walk was discontinued when Graham was fired. However, in 2022, interim coach Shaun Aguano announced that the Sun Devil Walk is returning. The most recognizable songs played by the band are &quot;Alma Mater&quot; and ASU&#x27;s fight songs titled &quot;Maroon and Gold&quot; and the &quot;Al Davis Fight Song&quot;. &quot;Alma Mater&quot; was composed by former Music Professor and Director of Sun Devil Marching Band (then known as Bulldog Marching Band), Miles A. Dresskell, in 1937. &quot;Maroon and Gold&quot; was authored by former Director of Sun Devil Marching Band, Felix E. McKernan, in 1948. The &quot;Al Davis Fight Song&quot; (also known as &quot;Go, Go Sun Devils&quot; and &quot;Arizona State University Fight Song&quot;) was composed by ASU alumnus Albert Oliver Davis in the 1940s without any lyrics. Recently lyrics were added to the song.

===Curtain of Distraction===
The Curtain of Distraction is a tradition that appears at every men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball game. The tradition started in 2013 in order to get fans to the games. In the second half of basketball games, a portable &quot;curtain&quot; opens up in front of the opponents shooting a free throw and students pop out of the curtain to try and distract the opponent. Some of the skits include an Elvis impersonator, people rubbing mayonnaise on their chest, and people wearing unicorn heads. In 2016, former Olympian Michael Phelps came out of the curtain wearing a Speedo during a game against Oregon State. ESPN estimated that distraction may give ASU a one-to-three point advantage.

==Student life==
===Extracurricular programs===
Arizona State University has an active extracurricular involvement program. Located on the second floor of the Student Pavilion at the Tempe campus, Educational Outreach and Student Services (EOSS) provides opportunities for student involvement through clubs, sororities, fraternities, community service, leadership, student government, and co-curricular programming.

The oldest student organization on campus is Devils&#x27; Advocates, the volunteer campus tour guide organization, which was founded in 1966 as a way to more competitively recruit National Merit Scholars. There are over 1,100 ASU alumni who can call themselves Advos.

Changemaker Central is a student-run centralized resource hub for student involvement in social entrepreneurship, civic engagement, service-learning, and community service that catalyzes student-driven social change. Changemaker Central locations have opened on all campuses in fall 2011, providing flexible, creative workspaces for everyone in the ASU community. The project is entirely student run and advances ASU&#x27;s institutional commitments to social embeddedness and entrepreneurship. The space allows students to meet, work and join new networks and collaborative enterprises while taking advantage of ASU&#x27;s many resources and opportunities for engagement. Changemaker Central has signature programs, including Changemaker Challenge, that support students in their journey to become changemakers by creating communities of support around new solutions/ideas and increasing access to early stage seed funding. The Changemaker Challenge seeks undergraduate and graduate students from across the university who are dedicated to making a difference in our local and global communities through innovation. Students can win up to $10,000 to make their innovative project, prototype, venture or community partnership ideas happen.

In addition to Changemaker Central, the Greek community (Greek Life) at Arizona State University has been important in binding students to the university, and providing social outlets. ASU is also home to one of the nation&#x27;s first and fastest growing gay fraternities, Sigma Phi Beta, founded in 2003; considered a sign of the growing university&#x27;s commitment to supporting diversity and inclusion.

The second Eta chapter of Phrateres, a non-exclusive, non-profit social-service club, was installed here in 1958 and became inactive in the 1990s.

There are multiple councils for Greek Life, including the Interfraternity Council (IFC), Multicultural Greek Council (MGC), National Association of Latino Fraternal Organizations (NALFO), National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC), Panhellenic Association (PHA), and the Professional Fraternity Council (PFC).

===Student media===
&quot;The State Press&quot; is the university&#x27;s independent, student-operated news publication. &quot;The State Press&quot; covers news and events on all four ASU campuses. Student editors and managers are solely responsible for the content of the &quot;State Press&quot; website. These publications are overseen by an independent board and guided by a professional adviser employed by the university.

&quot;The Downtown Devil&quot; is a student-run news publication website for the Downtown Phoenix Campus, produced by students at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication.

ASU has one student-run radio station, Blaze Radio. Blaze Radio is a completely student-run broadcast station owned and funded by the Cronkite School of Journalism. The station broadcasts using a 24-hour online stream on their official website. Blaze Radio plays music 24 hours a day and features daily student-hosted news, music, and sports specialty programs.

===Student government===
Associated Students of Arizona State University (ASASU) is the student government at Arizona State University. It is composed of the Undergraduate Student Government and the Graduate &amp; Professional Student Association (GPSA). Each ASU campus has a specific USG; USG Tempe (Tempe), USGD (Downtown), USG Polytechnic (Polytechnic) and USG West (West). Members and officers of ASASU are elected annually by the student body.

The Residence Hall Association (RHA) of Arizona State University is the student government for every ASU student living on-campus. Each ASU campus has an RHA that operates independently. RHA&#x27;s purpose is to improve the quality of residence hall life and provide a cohesive voice for the residents by addressing the concerns of the on-campus populations to university administrators and other campus organizations; providing cultural, diversity, educational, and social programming; establishing and working with individual community councils.

==Athletics==

Arizona State University&#x27;s Division I athletic teams are called the Sun Devils, which is also the nickname used to refer to students and alumni of the university. They compete in the Big 12 Conference in 20 varsity sports. Historically, the university has highly performed in men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s, and mixed archery; men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s, and mixed badminton; women&#x27;s golf; women&#x27;s swimming and diving; baseball; and football. Arizona State University&#x27;s NCAA Division I-A program competes in 9 varsity sports for men and 11 for women. ASU&#x27;s athletic director is Ray Anderson, former executive vice president of football operations for the National Football League. Anderson replaced Steve Patterson, who was appointed to the position in 2012, replacing Lisa Love, the former Senior Associate Athletic Director at the University of Southern California. Love was responsible for the hiring of coaches Herb Sendek, the men&#x27;s basketball coach, and Dennis Erickson, the men&#x27;s football coach. Erickson was fired in 2011 and replaced by Todd Graham. In December 2017, ASU announced that Herm Edwards would replace Graham as the head football coach. The rival to Arizona State University is University of Arizona.

ASU has won 24 national collegiate team championships in the following sports: baseball (5), men&#x27;s golf (2), women&#x27;s golf (8), men&#x27;s gymnastics (1), softball (2), men&#x27;s indoor track (1), women&#x27;s indoor track (2), men&#x27;s outdoor track (1), women&#x27;s outdoor track (1), and wrestling (1).

In September 2009, criticism over the seven-figure salaries earned by various coaches at Arizona&#x27;s public universities (including ASU) prompted the Arizona Board of Regents to re-evaluate the salary and benefit policy for athletic staff. With the 2011 expansion of the Pac-12 Conference, a new $3 billion contract for revenue sharing among all the schools in the conference was established. With the infusion of funds, the salary issue and various athletic department budgeting issues at ASU were addressed. The Pac-12&#x27;s new media contract with ESPN allowed ASU to hire a new coach in 2012. A new salary and bonus package (maximum bonus of $2.05 million) was instituted and is one of the most lucrative in the conference. ASU also plans to expand its athletic facilities with a public-private investment strategy to create an amateur sports district that can accommodate the Pan American Games and operate as an Olympic Training Center. The athletic district will include a $300 million renovation of Sun Devil Stadium that will include new football facilities. The press box and football offices in Sun Devil Stadium were remodeled in 2012.

Arizona State Sun Devils football was founded in 1896 under coach Fred Irish. The team has played in the 2012 Fight Hunger Bowl, the 2011 Las Vegas bowl, the 2016 Cactus Bowl, and the 2007 Holiday Bowl. The Sun Devils played in the 1997 Rose Bowl and won the Rose Bowl in 1987. The team has appeared in the Fiesta Bowl in 1983, 1977, 1975, 1973, 1972, and 1971 winning 5 of 6. In 1970, and 1975, they were champions of the NCAA Division I FBS National Football Championship. The Sun Devils were Pac-12 Champions in 1986, 1996, and 2007. Altogether, the football team has 17 Conference Championships and has participated in a total of 29 bowl games as of the 2015–2016 season with a 14–14–1 record in those games.

ASU Sun Devils Hockey competed with NCAA Division 1 schools for the first time in 2012, largely due to the success of the program. In 2016, they began as a full-time Division I team.

Eight members of ASU&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Swimming and Diving Team were selected to the Pac-10 All-Academic Team on April 5, 2010. In addition, five member of ASU&#x27;s Men&#x27;s Swimming and Diving Team were selected to the Pac-10 All-Academic Team on April 6, 2010.

In April 2015, Bobby Hurley was hired as the men&#x27;s basketball coach, replacing Herb Sendek. Previously, Hurley was the head coach at the University at Buffalo for the UB Bulls as well as an assistant coach at Rhode Island and Wagner University.

In 2015, Bob Bowman was hired as the head swim coach. Previously, Bowman trained Michael Phelps through his Olympic career.
