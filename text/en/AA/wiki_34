<text>Arbor Day (or Arbour Day in some countries) is a secular day of observance in which individuals and groups are encouraged to plant trees. Today, many countries observe such a holiday. Though usually observed in the spring, the date varies, depending on climate and suitable planting season.
==Origins and history==
===First Arbor Day===
The Spanish village of Mondoñedo held the first documented arbor plantation festival in the world organized by its mayor in 1594. The place remains as Alameda de los Remedios and it is still planted with lime and horse-chestnut trees. A humble granite marker and a bronze plate recall the event. Additionally, the small Spanish village of Villanueva de la Sierra held the first modern Arbor Day, an initiative launched in 1805 by the local priest with the enthusiastic support of the entire population.

===First American Arbor Day===

The first American Arbor Day was originated by J. Sterling Morton of Nebraska City, Nebraska, at an annual meeting of the Nebraska State board of agriculture held in Lincoln. On April 10, 1872, an estimated one million trees were planted in Nebraska.

In 1883, the American Forestry Association made Birdsey Northrop of Connecticut the chairman of the committee to campaign for Arbor Day nationwide; Northrop further globalized the idea when he visited Japan in 1895 and delivered his Arbor Day and Village Improvement message. He also brought his enthusiasm for Arbor Day to Australia, Canada, and other countries in Europe.

===McCreight and Theodore Roosevelt===
Beginning in 1906, Pennsylvania conservationist Major Israel McCreight of DuBois, Pennsylvania, argued that President Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s conservation speeches were limited to businessmen in the lumber industry and recommended a campaign of youth education and a national policy on conservation education. McCreight urged Roosevelt to make a public statement to school children about trees and the destruction of American forests. Conservationist Gifford Pinchot, Chief of the United States Forest Service, embraced McCreight&#x27;s recommendations and asked the President to speak to the public school children of the United States about conservation. On April 15, 1907, Roosevelt issued an &quot;Arbor Day Proclamation to the School Children of the United States&quot; about the importance of trees and that forestry deserves to be taught in U.S. schools. Pinchot wrote McCreight, &quot;we shall all be indebted to you for having made the suggestion.&quot;

==Around the world==
===Australia===
Arbor Day has been observed in Australia since the first event took place in Adelaide, South Australia on the 20th June 1889. National Schools Tree Day is held on the last Friday of July for schools and National Tree Day the last Sunday in July throughout Australia. Many states have Arbour Day, although Victoria has an Arbour Week, which was suggested by Premier Rupert (Dick) Hamer in the 1980s.

===Belgium===
International Day of Treeplanting is celebrated in Flanders on or around 21 March as a theme-day/educational-day/observance, not as a public holiday. Tree planting is sometimes combined with awareness campaigns of the fight against cancer: &quot;Kom Op Tegen Kanker&quot;.

===Brazil===

===Canada===
The day was founded by Sir George William Ross, later the premier of Ontario, when he was minister of education in Ontario (1883–1899). According to the Ontario Teachers&#x27; Manuals &quot;History of Education&quot; (1915), Ross established both Arbour Day and Empire Day—&quot;the former to give the school children an interest in making and keeping the school grounds attractive, and the latter to inspire the children with a spirit of patriotism&quot; (p. 222). This predates the claimed founding of the day by Don Clark of Schomberg, Ontario for his wife Margret Clark in 1906. In Canada, National Forest Week is the last full week of September, and National Tree Day (Maple Leaf Day) falls on the Wednesday of that week. Ontario celebrates Arbour Week from the last Friday in April to the first Sunday in May. Prince Edward Island celebrates Arbour Day on the third Friday in May during Arbour Week. Arbour Day is the longest running civic greening project in Calgary and is celebrated on the first Thursday in May. On this day, each grade 1 student in Calgary&#x27;s schools receives a tree seedling to be taken home to be planted on private property.

===Greater China===
====Republic of China (Taiwan)====
Arbor Day (植樹節) was founded by the forester Ling Daoyang in 1915 and has been a traditional holiday in the Republic of China since 1916. The Beiyang government&#x27;s Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce first commemorated Arbor Day in 1915 at the suggestion of forester Ling Daoyang. In 1916, the government announced that all provinces of the Republic of China would celebrate the on the same day as the Qingming Festival, April 5, despite the differences in climate across China, which is on the first day of the fifth solar term of the traditional Chinese lunisolar calendar. From 1929, by decree of the Nationalist government, Arbor Day was , to commemorate the death of Sun Yat-sen, who had been a major advocate of afforestation in his life. Following the retreat of the government of the Republic of China to Taiwan in 1949, the celebration of Arbor Day on March 12 was retained.

====People&#x27;s Republic of China====
In People&#x27;s Republic of China, during the fourth session of the Fifth National People&#x27;s Congress of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1979 adopted the Resolution on the Unfolding of a Nationwide Voluntary Tree-planting Campaign. This resolution established the Arbor Day (植树节), also March 12, and stipulated that every able-bodied citizen between the ages of 11 and 60 should plant three to five trees per year or do the equivalent amount of work in seedling, cultivation, tree tending, or other services. Supporting documentation instructs all units to report population statistics to the local afforestation committees for workload allocation. Many couples choose to marry the day before the annual celebration, and they plant the tree to mark beginning of their life together and the new life of the tree.

===Netherlands===
Since conference and of the Food and Agriculture Organization&#x27;s publication &quot;World Festival of Trees&quot;, and a resolution of the United Nations in 1954: &quot;The Conference, recognising the need of arousing mass consciousness of the aesthetic, physical and economic value of trees, recommends a World Festival of Trees to be celebrated annually in each member country on a date suited to local conditions&quot;; it has been adopted by the Netherlands. In 1957, the National Committee Day of Planting Trees/Foundation of National Festival of Trees (&quot;Nationale Boomplantdag&quot;/&quot;Nationale Boomfeestdag&quot;) was created.

On the third Wednesday in March each year (near the spring equinox), three quarters of Dutch schoolchildren aged 10/11 and Dutch celebrities plant trees. Stichting Nationale Boomfeestdag organizes all the activities in the Netherlands for this day. Some municipalities however plant the trees around 21 September because of the planting season.

In 2007, the 50th anniversary was celebrated with special golden jubilee activities.

===New Zealand===
New Zealand&#x27;s first Arbor Day planting was on 3 July 1890 at Greytown, in the Wairarapa. The first official celebration was scheduled to take place in Wellington in August 1892, with the planting of pōhutukawa and Norfolk pines along Thorndon Esplanade.

Prominent New Zealand botanist Dr Leonard Cockayne worked extensively on native plants throughout New Zealand and wrote many notable botanical texts. As early as the 1920s he held a vision for school students of New Zealand to be involved in planting native trees and plants in their school grounds. This vision bore fruit and schools in New Zealand have long planted native trees on Arbor Day.

Since 1977, New Zealand has celebrated Arbor Day on 5 June, which is also World Environment Day. Prior to then, Arbor Day was celebrated on 4 August, which is rather late in the year for tree planting in New Zealand, hence the date change.

Many of the Department of Conservation&#x27;s Arbor Day activities focus on ecological restoration projects using native plants to restore habitats that have been damaged or destroyed by humans or invasive pests and weeds. There are great restoration projects underway around New Zealand and many organisations including community groups, landowners, conservation organisations, iwi, volunteers, schools, local businesses, nurseries and councils are involved in them. These projects are part of a vision to protect and restore the indigenous biodiversity.

===Niger===
Since 1975, Niger has celebrated Arbor Day as part of its Independence Day: 3 August. On this day, aiding the fight against desertification, each Nigerien plants a tree. 

===North Macedonia===
Having in mind the bad condition of the forest fund, and in particular the catastrophic wildfires which occurred in the summer of 2007, a citizens&#x27; initiative for afforestation was started in North Macedonia. The campaign by the name &#x27;Tree Day-Plant Your Future&#x27; was first organized on 12 March 2008, when an official non-working day was declared and more than 150,000 Macedonians planted 2 million trees in one day (symbolically, one for each citizen). Six million more were planted in November the same year, and another 12,5 million trees in 2009. This has been established as a tradition and takes place every year.

===Pakistan===
National tree plantation day of Pakistan (قومی شجر کاری دن) is celebrated on 18 August.

===Philippines===
Since 1947, Arbor Day in the Philippines has been institutionalized to be observed throughout the nation by planting trees and ornamental plants and other forms of relevant activities. Its practice was instituted through Proclamation No. 30. It was subsequently revised by Proclamation No. 41, issued in the same year. In 1955, the commemoration was extended from a day to a week and moved to the last full week of July. Over two decades later, its commemoration was moved to the second week of June. In 2003, the commemorations were reduced from a week to a day and was moved to June 25 per Proclamation No. 396. The same proclamation directed &quot;the active participation of all government agencies, including government-owned and controlled corporations, private sector, schools, civil society groups and the citizenry in tree planting activity&quot;. It was subsequently revised by Proclamation 643 in the succeeding year.

In 2012, Republic Act 10176 was passed, which revived tree planting events &quot;as [a] yearly event for local government units&quot; and mandated the planting of at least one tree per year for able-bodied Filipino citizens aged 12 years old and above. Since 2012, many local arbor day celebrations have been commemorated, as in the cases of Natividad and Tayug in Pangasinan and Santa Rita in Pampanga.

===South Africa===
Arbor Day was celebrated from 1945 until 2000 in South Africa. After that, the national government extended it to National Arbor Week, which lasts annually from 1–7 September. Two trees, one common and one rare, are highlighted to increase public awareness of indigenous trees, while various &quot;greening&quot; activities are undertaken by schools, businesses and other organizations. For example, the social enterprise Greenpop, which focusses on sustainable urban greening, forest restoration and environmental awareness in Sub-Saharan Africa, leverages Arbor Day each year to call for tree planting action. During Arbor Month 2019, responding to recent studies that underscore the importance of tree restoration, they launched their new goal of planting 500,000 by 2025.

===Spain===

In 1896 Mariano Belmás Estrada promoted the first &quot;Festival of Trees&quot; in Madrid.
In Spain there was an International Forest Day on 21 March, but a decree in 1915 also brought in an Arbor Day throughout Spain. Each municipality or collective decides the date for its Arbor Day, usually between February and May. In Villanueva de la Sierra (Extremadura), where the first Arbor Day in the world was held in 1805, it is celebrated, as on that occasion, on Tuesday Carnaval. It is a great day in the local festive calendar.

As an example of commitment to nature, the small town of Pescueza, with only 180 inhabitants, organizes every spring a large plantation of holm oaks, which is called the &quot;Festivalino&quot;, promoted by city council, several foundations, and citizen participation.

<text>Sir Alfred Jules &quot;Freddie&quot; Ayer ( ; 29 October 1910 – 27 June 1989) was an English philosopher known for his promotion of logical positivism, particularly in his books &quot;Language, Truth, and Logic&quot; (1936) and &quot;The Problem of Knowledge&quot; (1956).

Ayer was educated at Eton College and the University of Oxford, after which he studied the philosophy of logical positivism at the University of Vienna. From 1933 to 1940 he lectured on philosophy at Christ Church, Oxford.

During the Second World War Ayer was a Special Operations Executive and MI6 agent.

Ayer was Grote Professor of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic at University College London from 1946 until 1959, after which he returned to Oxford to become Wykeham Professor of Logic at New College. He was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1951 to 1952 and knighted in 1970. He was known for his advocacy of humanism, and was the second president of the British Humanist Association (now known as Humanists UK).

Ayer was president of the Homosexual Law Reform Society for a time; he remarked, &quot;as a notorious heterosexual I could never be accused of feathering my own nest.&quot;

== Life ==
Ayer was born in St John&#x27;s Wood, in north west London, to Jules Louis Cyprien Ayer and Reine (née Citroen), wealthy parents from continental Europe. His mother was from the Dutch-Jewish family that founded the Citroën car company in France; his father was a Swiss Calvinist financier who worked for the Rothschild family, including for their bank and as secretary to Alfred Rothschild.

Ayer was educated at Ascham St Vincent&#x27;s School, a former boarding preparatory school for boys in the seaside town of Eastbourne in Sussex, where he started boarding at the relatively early age of seven for reasons to do with the First World War, and at Eton College, where he was a King&#x27;s Scholar. At Eton Ayer first became known for his characteristic bravado and precocity. Though primarily interested in his intellectual pursuits, he was very keen on sports, particularly rugby, and reputedly played the Eton Wall Game very well. In the final examinations at Eton, Ayer came second in his year, and first in classics. In his final year, as a member of Eton&#x27;s senior council, he unsuccessfully campaigned for the abolition of corporal punishment at the school. He won a classics scholarship to Christ Church, Oxford. He graduated with a BA with first-class honours.

After graduating from Oxford, Ayer spent a year in Vienna, returned to England and published his first book, &quot;Language, Truth and Logic&quot;, in 1936. This first exposition in English of logical positivism as newly developed by the Vienna Circle, made Ayer at age 26 the &quot;enfant terrible&quot; of British philosophy. As a newly famous intellectual, he played a prominent role in the Oxford by-election campaign of 1938. Ayer campaigned first for the Labour candidate Patrick Gordon Walker, and then for the joint Labour-Liberal &quot;Independent Progressive&quot; candidate Sandie Lindsay, who ran on an anti-appeasement platform against the Conservative candidate, Quintin Hogg, who ran as the appeasement candidate. The by-election, held on 27 October 1938, was quite close, with Hogg winning narrowly.

In the Second World War, Ayer served as an officer in the Welsh Guards, chiefly in intelligence (Special Operations Executive (SOE) and MI6). He was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Welsh Guards from the Officer Cadet Training Unit on 21 September 1940.

After the war, Ayer briefly returned to the University of Oxford where he became a fellow and Dean of Wadham College. He then taught philosophy at University College London from 1946 until 1959, during which time he started to appear on radio and television. He was an extrovert and social mixer who liked dancing and attending clubs in London and New York. He was also obsessed with sport: he had played rugby for Eton, and was a noted cricketer and a keen supporter of Tottenham Hotspur football team, where he was for many years a season ticket holder. For an academic, Ayer was an unusually well-connected figure in his time, with close links to &#x27;high society&#x27; and the establishment. Presiding over Oxford high-tables, he is often described as charming, but could also be intimidating.

Ayer was married four times to three women. His first marriage was from 1932 to 1941, to (Grace Isabel) Renée, with whom he had a sonallegedly the son of Ayer&#x27;s friend and colleague Stuart Hampshireand a daughter. Renée subsequently married Hampshire. In 1960, Ayer married Alberta Constance (Dee) Wells, with whom he had one son. That marriage was dissolved in 1983, and the same year, Ayer married Vanessa Salmon, the former wife of politician Nigel Lawson. She died in 1985, and in 1989 Ayer remarried Wells, who survived him. He also had a daughter with Hollywood columnist Sheilah Graham Westbrook.

In 1950, Ayer attended the founding meeting of the Congress for Cultural Freedom in West Berlin, though he later said he went only because of the offer of a &quot;free trip&quot;. He gave a speech on why John Stuart Mill&#x27;s conceptions of liberty and freedom were still valid in the 20th century. Together with the historian Hugh Trevor-Roper, Ayer fought against Arthur Koestler and Franz Borkenau, arguing that they were far too dogmatic and extreme in their anti-communism, in fact proposing illiberal measures in the defence of liberty. Adding to the tension was the location of the congress in West Berlin, together with the fact that the Korean War began on 25 June 1950, the fourth day of the congress, giving a feeling that the world was on the brink of war.

From 1959 to his retirement in 1978, Ayer held the Wykeham Chair, Professor of Logic at Oxford. He was knighted in 1970. After his retirement, Ayer taught or lectured several times in the United States, including as a visiting professor at Bard College in 1987. At a party that same year held by fashion designer Fernando Sanchez, Ayer confronted Mike Tyson, who was forcing himself upon the then little-known model Naomi Campbell. When Ayer demanded that Tyson stop, Tyson reportedly asked, &quot;Do you know who the fuck I am? I&#x27;m the heavyweight champion of the world&quot;, to which Ayer replied, &quot;And I am the former Wykeham Professor of Logic. We are both pre-eminent in our field. I suggest that we talk about this like rational men&quot;. Ayer and Tyson then began to talk, allowing Campbell to slip out. Gully Wells, Ayer’s stepdaughter via Dee Wells, records the same event with some slight variation of detail. 

Ayer was also involved in politics, including anti-Vietnam War activism, supporting the Labour Party (and later the Social Democratic Party), chairing the Campaign Against Racial Discrimination in Sport, and serving as president of the Homosexual Law Reform Society.

In 1988, a year before his death, Ayer wrote an article titled &quot;What I saw when I was dead&quot;, describing an unusual near-death experience after his heart stopped for four minutes as he choked on smoked salmon. Of the experience, he first said that it &quot;slightly weakened my conviction that my genuine death ... will be the end of me, though I continue to hope that it will be.&quot; A few weeks later, he revised this, saying, &quot;what I should have said is that my experiences have weakened, not my belief that there is no life after death, but my inflexible attitude towards that belief&quot;.

Ayer died on 27 June 1989. From 1980 to 1989 he lived at 51 York Street, Marylebone, where a memorial plaque was unveiled on 19 November 1995.

== Philosophical ideas ==
In &quot;Language, Truth and Logic&quot; (1936), Ayer presents the verification principle as the only valid basis for philosophy. Unless logical or empirical verification is possible, statements like &quot;God exists&quot; or &quot;charity is good&quot; are not true or untrue but meaningless, and may thus be excluded or ignored. Religious language in particular is unverifiable and as such literally nonsense. He also criticises C. A. Mace&#x27;s opinion that metaphysics is a form of intellectual poetry. The stance that a belief in God denotes no verifiable hypothesis is sometimes referred to as igtheism (for example, by Paul Kurtz). In later years, Ayer reiterated that he did not believe in God and began to call himself an atheist. He followed in the footsteps of Bertrand Russell by debating religion with the Jesuit scholar Frederick Copleston.

Ayer&#x27;s version of emotivism divides &quot;the ordinary system of ethics&quot; into four classes:
#&quot;Propositions that express definitions of ethical terms, or judgements about the legitimacy or possibility of certain definitions&quot;
#&quot;Propositions describing the phenomena of moral experience, and their causes&quot;
#&quot;Exhortations to moral virtue&quot;
#&quot;Actual ethical judgements&quot;
He focuses on propositions of the first classmoral judgementssaying that those of the second class belong to science, those of the third are mere commands, and those of the fourth (which are considered normative ethics as opposed to meta-ethics) are too concrete for ethical philosophy.

Ayer argues that moral judgements cannot be translated into non-ethical, empirical terms and thus cannot be verified; in this he agrees with ethical intuitionists. But he differs from intuitionists by discarding appeals to intuition of non-empirical moral truths as &quot;worthless&quot; since the intuition of one person often contradicts that of another. Instead, Ayer concludes that ethical concepts are &quot;mere pseudo-concepts&quot;:

Between 1945 and 1947, together with Russell and George Orwell, Ayer contributed a series of articles to &quot;Polemic&quot;, a short-lived British &quot;Magazine of Philosophy, Psychology, and Aesthetics&quot; edited by the ex-Communist Humphrey Slater.

Ayer was closely associated with the British humanist movement. He was an Honorary Associate of the Rationalist Press Association from 1947 until his death. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1963. In 1965, he became the first president of the Agnostics&#x27; Adoption Society and in the same year succeeded Julian Huxley as president of the British Humanist Association, a post he held until 1970. In 1968 he edited &quot;The Humanist Outlook&quot;, a collection of essays on the meaning of humanism. He was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto.

== Works ==
Ayer is best known for popularising the verification principle, in particular through his presentation of it in &quot;Language, Truth, and Logic&quot;. The principle was at the time at the heart of the debates of the so-called Vienna Circle, which Ayer had visited as a young guest. Others, including the circle&#x27;s leading light, Moritz Schlick, were already writing papers on the issue. Ayer&#x27;s formulation was that a sentence can be meaningful only if it has verifiable empirical import; otherwise, it is either &quot;analytical&quot; if tautologous or &quot;metaphysical&quot; (i.e. meaningless, or &quot;literally senseless&quot;). He started to work on the book at the age of 23 and it was published when he was 26. Ayer&#x27;s philosophical ideas were deeply influenced by those of the Vienna Circle and David Hume. His clear, vibrant and polemical exposition of them makes &quot;Language, Truth and Logic&quot; essential reading on the tenets of logical empiricism; the book is regarded as a classic of 20th-century analytic philosophy and is widely read in philosophy courses around the world. In it, Ayer also proposes that the distinction between a conscious man and an unconscious machine resolves itself into a distinction between &quot;different types of perceptible behaviour&quot;, an argument that anticipates the Turing test published in 1950 to test a machine&#x27;s capability to demonstrate intelligence.

Ayer wrote two books on the philosopher Bertrand Russell, &quot;Russell and Moore: The Analytic Heritage&quot; (1971) and &quot;Russell&quot; (1972). He also wrote an introductory book on the philosophy of David Hume and a short biography of Voltaire.

Ayer was a strong critic of the German philosopher Martin Heidegger. As a logical positivist, Ayer was in conflict with Heidegger&#x27;s vast, overarching theories of existence. Ayer considered them completely unverifiable through empirical demonstration and logical analysis, and this sort of philosophy an unfortunate strain in modern thought. He considered Heidegger the worst example of such philosophy, which Ayer believed entirely useless. In &quot;Philosophy in the Twentieth Century&quot;, Ayer accuses Heidegger of &quot;surprising ignorance&quot; or &quot;unscrupulous distortion&quot; and &quot;what can fairly be described as charlatanism.&quot;

In 1972–73, Ayer gave the Gifford Lectures at the University of St Andrews, later published as &quot;The Central Questions of Philosophy&quot;. In the book&#x27;s preface, he defends his selection to hold the lectureship on the basis that Lord Gifford wished to promote &quot;natural theology, in the widest sense of that term&quot;, and that non-believers are allowed to give the lectures if they are &quot;able reverent men, true thinkers, sincere lovers of and earnest inquirers after truth&quot;. He still believed in the viewpoint he shared with the logical positivists: that large parts of what was traditionally called philosophyincluding metaphysics, theology and aestheticswere not matters that could be judged true or false, and that it was thus meaningless to discuss them.

In &quot;The Concept of a Person and Other Essays&quot; (1963), Ayer heavily criticised Wittgenstein&#x27;s private language argument.

Ayer&#x27;s sense-data theory in &quot;Foundations of Empirical Knowledge&quot; was famously criticised by fellow Oxonian J. L. Austin in &quot;Sense and Sensibilia&quot;, a landmark 1950s work of ordinary language philosophy. Ayer responded in the essay &quot;Has Austin Refuted the Sense-datum Theory?&quot;, which can be found in his &quot;Metaphysics and Common Sense&quot; (1969).

== Awards ==
Ayer was awarded a knighthood as Knight Bachelor in the London Gazette on 1 January 1970.

<doc id="2019" wikidata="Q323232" url="?curid=2019" title="André Weil">
<text>André Weil (; ; 6 May 1906 – 6 August 1998) was a French mathematician, known for his foundational work in number theory and algebraic geometry. He was one of the most influential mathematicians of the twentieth century. His influence is due
both to his original contributions to a remarkably broad
spectrum of mathematical theories, and to the mark 
he left on mathematical practice and style, through
some of his own works as well as through the Bourbaki group, of which he was one of the principal
founders.

==Life==
André Weil was born in Paris to agnostic Alsatian Jewish parents who fled the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine by the German Empire after the Franco-Prussian War in 1870–71. Simone Weil, who would later become a famous philosopher, was Weil&#x27;s younger sister and only sibling. He studied in Paris, Rome and Göttingen and received his doctorate in 1928. While in Germany, Weil befriended Carl Ludwig Siegel. Starting in 1930, he spent two academic years at Aligarh Muslim University in India. Aside from mathematics, Weil held lifelong interests in classical Greek and Latin literature, Hinduism and Sanskrit literature: he had taught himself Sanskrit in 1920 at age 14. After teaching for one year at Aix-Marseille University, he taught for six years at University of Strasbourg. He married Éveline de Possel (née Éveline Gillet) in 1937.

Weil was in Finland when World War II broke out; he had been traveling in Scandinavia since April 1939. His wife Éveline returned to France without him. Weil was arrested in Finland at the outbreak of the Winter War on suspicion of spying; however, accounts of his life having been in danger were shown to be exaggerated. Weil returned to France via Sweden and the United Kingdom, and was detained at Le Havre in January 1940. He was charged with failure to report for duty, and was imprisoned in Le Havre and then Rouen. It was in the military prison in Bonne-Nouvelle, a district of Rouen, from February to May, that Weil completed the work that made his reputation. He was tried on 3 May 1940. Sentenced to five years, he requested to be attached to a military unit instead, and was given the chance to join a regiment in Cherbourg. After the fall of France in June 1940, he met up with his family in Marseille, where he arrived by sea. He then went to Clermont-Ferrand, where he managed to join his wife, Éveline, who had been living in German-occupied France.

In January 1941, Weil and his family sailed from Marseille to New York. He spent the remainder of the war in the United States, where he was supported by the Rockefeller Foundation and the Guggenheim Foundation. For two years, he taught undergraduate mathematics at Lehigh University, where he was unappreciated, overworked and poorly paid, although he did not have to worry about being drafted, unlike his American students. He quit the job at Lehigh and moved to Brazil, where he taught at the Universidade de São Paulo from 1945 to 1947, working with Oscar Zariski. Weil and his wife had two daughters, Sylvie (born in 1942) and Nicolette (born in 1946).

He then returned to the United States and taught at the University of Chicago from 1947 to 1958, before moving to the Institute for Advanced Study, where he would spend the remainder of his career. He was a Plenary Speaker at the ICM in 1950 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1954 in Amsterdam, and in 1978 in Helsinki. Weil was elected Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 1966. In 1979, he shared the second Wolf Prize in Mathematics with Jean Leray.

==Work==
Weil made substantial contributions in a number of areas, the most important being his discovery of profound connections between algebraic geometry and number theory. This began in his doctoral work leading to the Mordell–Weil theorem (1928, and shortly applied in Siegel&#x27;s theorem on integral points). Mordell&#x27;s theorem had an &quot;ad hoc&quot; proof; Weil began the separation of the infinite descent argument into two types of structural approach, by means of height functions for sizing rational points, and by means of Galois cohomology, which would not be categorized as such for another two decades. Both aspects of Weil&#x27;s work have steadily developed into substantial theories.

Among his major accomplishments were the 1940s proof of the Riemann hypothesis for zeta-functions of curves over finite fields, and his subsequent laying of proper foundations for algebraic geometry to support that result (from 1942 to 1946, most intensively). The so-called Weil conjectures were hugely influential from around 1950; these statements were later proved by Bernard Dwork, Alexander Grothendieck, Michael Artin, and finally by Pierre Deligne, who completed the most difficult step in 1973.

Weil introduced the adele ring in the late 1930s, following Claude Chevalley&#x27;s lead with the ideles, and gave a proof of the Riemann–Roch theorem with them (a version appeared in his &quot;Basic Number Theory&quot; in 1967). His &#x27;matrix divisor&#x27; (vector bundle &quot;avant la lettre&quot;) Riemann–Roch theorem from 1938 was a very early anticipation of later ideas such as moduli spaces of bundles. The Weil conjecture on Tamagawa numbers proved resistant for many years. Eventually the adelic approach became basic in automorphic representation theory. He picked up another credited &quot;Weil conjecture&quot;, around 1967, which later under pressure from Serge Lang (resp. of Serre) became known as the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture (resp. Taniyama–Weil conjecture) based on a roughly formulated question of Taniyama at the 1955 Nikkō conference. His attitude towards conjectures was that one should not dignify a guess as a conjecture lightly, and in the Taniyama case, the evidence was only there after extensive computational work carried out from the late 1960s.

Other significant results were on Pontryagin duality and differential geometry. He introduced the concept of a uniform space in general topology, as a by-product of his collaboration with Nicolas Bourbaki (of which he was a Founding Father). His work on sheaf theory hardly appears in his published papers, but correspondence with Henri Cartan in the late 1940s, and reprinted in his collected papers, proved most influential. He also chose the symbol ∅, derived from the letter Ø in the Norwegian alphabet (which he alone among the Bourbaki group was familiar with), to represent the empty set.

Weil also made a well-known contribution in Riemannian geometry in his very first paper in 1926, when he showed that the classical isoperimetric inequality holds on non-positively curved surfaces. This established the 2-dimensional case of what later became known as the Cartan–Hadamard conjecture.

He discovered that the so-called Weil representation, previously introduced in quantum mechanics by Irving Segal and David Shale, gave a contemporary framework for understanding the classical theory of quadratic forms. This was also a beginning of a substantial development by others, connecting representation theory and theta functions.

Weil was a member of both the National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.

==As expositor==
Weil&#x27;s ideas made an important contribution to the writings and seminars of Bourbaki, before and after World War II. He also wrote several books on the history of number theory.

==Beliefs==

Hindu thought had great influence on Weil. He was an agnostic, and he respected religions.

==Legacy==
Asteroid 289085 Andreweil, discovered by astronomers at the Saint-Sulpice Observatory in 2004, was named in his memory. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 14 February 2014 ().

<text>The Achaeans or Akhaians (; , &quot;the Achaeans&quot; or &quot;of Achaea&quot;) is one of the names in Homer which is used to refer to the Greeks collectively.

The term &quot;Achaean&quot; is believed to be related to the Hittite term Ahhiyawa and the Egyptian term Ekwesh which appear in texts from the Late Bronze Age and are believed to refer to the Mycenaean civilization or some part of it. 

In the historical period, the term fell into disuse as a general term for Greek people, and was generally reserved for inhabitants of the region of Achaea, a region in the north-central part of the Peloponnese. The city-states of this region later formed a confederation known as the Achaean League, which was influential during the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC.

==Etymology==

According to Margalit Finkelberg the name Ἀχαιοί (earlier Ἀχαιϝοί) is possibly derived, via an intermediate form *Ἀχαϝyοί, from a hypothetical older Greek form reflected in the Hittite form &quot;Aḫḫiyawā&quot;; the latter is attested in the Hittite archives, e.g. in the Tawagalawa letter. However, Robert S. P. Beekes doubted its validity and suggested a Pre-Greek &quot;*Akaywa-&quot;.

==Homeric versus later use==

In Homer, the term Achaeans is one of the primary terms used to refer to the Greeks as a whole. It is used 598 times in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, often accompanied by the epithet &quot;long-haired&quot;. Other common names used in Homer are Danaans (; &quot;Danaoi&quot;; used 138 times in the &quot;Iliad&quot;) and Argives (; ; used 182 times in the &quot;Iliad&quot;) while Panhellenes ( &quot;Panhellenes,&quot; &quot;All of the Greeks&quot;) and Hellenes (; &quot;Hellenes&quot;) both appear only once; All of the aforementioned terms were used synonymously to denote a common Greek identity. In some English translations of the &quot;Iliad&quot;, the Achaeans are simply called the Greeks throughout.

Later, by the Archaic and Classical periods, the term &quot;Achaeans&quot; referred to inhabitants of the much smaller region of Achaea. Herodotus identified the Achaeans of the northern Peloponnese as descendants of the earlier, Homeric Achaeans. According to Pausanias, writing in the 2nd century AD, the term &quot;Achaean&quot; was originally given to those Greeks inhabiting the Argolis and Laconia.

Pausanias and Herodotus both recount the legend that the Achaeans were forced from their homelands by the Dorians, during the legendary Dorian invasion of the Peloponnese. They then moved into the region later called Achaea.

A scholarly consensus has not yet been reached on the origin of the historic Achaeans relative to the Homeric Achaeans and is still hotly debated. Former emphasis on presumed race, such as John A. Scott&#x27;s article about the blond locks of the Achaeans as compared to the dark locks of &quot;Mediterranean&quot; Poseidon, on the basis of hints in Homer, has been rejected by some. The contrasting belief that &quot;Achaeans&quot;, as understood through Homer, is &quot;a name without a country&quot;, an &quot;ethnos&quot; created in the Epic tradition, has modern supporters among those who conclude that &quot;Achaeans&quot; were redefined in the 5th century BC, as contemporary speakers of Aeolic Greek.

Karl Beloch suggested there was no Dorian invasion, but rather that the Peloponnesian Dorians were the Achaeans. Eduard Meyer, disagreeing with Beloch, instead put forth the suggestion that the real-life Achaeans were mainland pre-Dorian Greeks. His conclusion is based on his research on the similarity between the languages of the Achaeans and pre-historic Arcadians. William Prentice disagreed with both, noting archeological evidence suggests the Achaeans instead migrated from &quot;southern Asia Minor to Greece, probably settling first in lower Thessaly&quot; probably prior to 2000 BC.

==Hittite documents==
Some Hittite texts mention a nation to the west called Ahhiyawa ( &quot;Aḫḫiyawa&quot;). In the earliest reference to this land, a letter outlining the treaty violations of the Hittite vassal Madduwatta, it is called &quot;Ahhiya&quot;. Another important example is the &quot;Tawagalawa Letter&quot; written by an unnamed Hittite king (most probably Hattusili III) of the empire period (14th–13th century BC) to the king of &quot;Ahhiyawa&quot;, treating him as an equal and implying Miletus (&quot;Millawanda&quot;) was under his control. It also refers to an earlier &quot;&quot;Wilusa&quot; episode&quot; involving hostility on the part of &quot;Ahhiyawa&quot;. Ahhiya(wa) has been identified with the Achaeans of the Trojan War and the city of Wilusa with the legendary city of Troy (note the similarity with early Greek &quot;Wilion&quot;, later &quot;Ilion&quot;, the name of the acropolis of Troy).

Emil Forrer, a Swiss Hittitologist who worked on the Boghazköy tablets in Berlin, said the Achaeans of pre-Homeric Greece were directly associated with the term &quot;Land of Ahhiyawa&quot; mentioned in the Hittite texts. His conclusions at the time were challenged by other Hittitologists (i.e. Johannes Friedrich in 1927 and Albrecht Götze in 1930), as well as by Ferdinand Sommer, who published his (&quot;The Ahhiyawa Documents&quot;) in 1932. The exact relationship of the term &quot;Ahhiyawa&quot; to the Achaeans beyond a similarity in pronunciation was hotly debated by scholars, even following the discovery that Mycenaean Linear B is an early form of Greek; the earlier debate was summed up in 1984 by Hans G. Güterbock of the Oriental Institute. More recent research based on new readings and interpretations of the Hittite texts, as well as of the material evidence for Mycenaean contacts with the Anatolian mainland, came to the conclusion that &quot;Ahhiyawa&quot; referred to the Mycenaean world, or at least to a part of it.

Scholarship up to 2011 was reviewed by Gary M. Beckman et al. In this review, the increasing acceptance of the Ahhiyawa-Mycenaeans hypothesis was noted. As to the exact location of Ahhiyawa:

In fact, the authors state that &quot;there is now little doubt that Ahhiyawa was a reference by the Hittites to some or all of the Bronze Age Mycenaean world&quot;, and that Forrer was &quot;largely correct after all&quot;.

==Egyptian sources==
It has been proposed that &quot;Ekwesh&quot; of the Egyptian records may relate to &quot;Achaea&quot; (compared to Hittite &quot;Ahhiyawa&quot;), whereas &quot;Denyen&quot; and &quot;Tanaju&quot; may relate to Classical Greek &quot;Danaoi&quot;. The earliest textual reference to the Mycenaean world is in the Annals of Thutmosis III (–1425 BC), which refers to messengers from the king of the Tanaju, , offering greeting gifts to the Egyptian king, in order to initiate diplomatic relations, when the latter campaigned in Syria. Tanaju is also listed in an inscription at the Mortuary Temple of Amenhotep III. The latter ruled Egypt in –1344 BC. Moreover, a list of the cities and regions of the Tanaju is also mentioned in this inscription; among the cities listed are Mycenae, Nauplion, Kythera, Messenia and the Thebaid (region of Thebes).

During the 5th year of Pharaoh Merneptah, a confederation of Libyan and northern peoples is supposed to have attacked the western delta. Included amongst the ethnic names of the repulsed invaders is the Ekwesh or Eqwesh, whom some have seen as Achaeans, although Egyptian texts specifically mention these Ekwesh to be circumcised. Homer mentions an Achaean attack upon the delta, and Menelaus speaks of the same in Book IV of the &quot;Odyssey&quot; to Telemachus when he recounts his own return home from the Trojan War. Some ancient Greek authors also say that Helen had spent the time of the Trojan War in Egypt, and not at Troy, and that after Troy the Greeks went there to recover her.

==Greek mythology==
In Greek mythology, the perceived cultural divisions among the Hellenes were represented as legendary lines of descent that identified kinship groups, with each line being derived from an eponymous ancestor. Each of the Greek &quot;ethne&quot; were said to be named in honor of their respective ancestors: Achaeus of the Achaeans, Danaus of the Danaans, Cadmus of the Cadmeans (the Thebans), Hellen of the Hellenes (not to be confused with Helen of Troy), Aeolus of the Aeolians, Ion of the Ionians, and Dorus of the Dorians.

Cadmus from Phoenicia, Danaus from Egypt, and Pelops from Anatolia each gained a foothold in mainland Greece and were assimilated and Hellenized. Hellen, Graikos, Magnes, and Macedon were sons of Deucalion and Pyrrha, the only people who survived the Great Flood; the &quot;ethne&quot; were said to have originally been named &quot;Graikoi&quot; after the elder son but later renamed &quot;Hellenes&quot; after Hellen who was proved to be the strongest. Sons of Hellen and the nymph Orseis were Dorus, Xuthos, and Aeolus. Sons of Xuthos and Kreousa, daughter of Erechthea, were Ion and Achaeus.

According to Hyginus, 22 Achaeans killed 362 Trojans during their ten years at Troy.

<doc id="2021" wikidata="Q211041" url="?curid=2021" title="Atle Selberg">
<text>Atle Selberg (14 June 1917 – 6 August 2007) was a Norwegian mathematician known for his work in analytic number theory and the theory of automorphic forms, and in particular for bringing them into relation with spectral theory. He was awarded the Fields Medal in 1950 and an honorary Abel Prize in 2002.

== Early years ==
Selberg was born in Langesund, Norway, the son of teacher Anna Kristina Selberg and mathematician Ole Michael Ludvigsen Selberg. Two of his three brothers, Sigmund and Henrik, were also mathematicians. His other brother, Arne, was a professor of engineering. 

While he was still at school he was influenced by the work of Srinivasa Ramanujan and he found an exact analytical formula for the partition function as suggested by the works of Ramanujan; however, this result was first published by Hans Rademacher.

He studied at the University of Oslo and completed his doctorate in 1943.

==World War II==
During World War II, Selberg worked in isolation due to the German occupation of Norway. After the war, his accomplishments became known, including a proof that a positive proportion of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function lie on the line formula_1.

During the war, he fought against the German invasion of Norway, and was imprisoned several times.

==Post-war in Norway==
After the war, he turned to sieve theory, a previously neglected topic which Selberg&#x27;s work brought into prominence. In a 1947 paper he introduced the Selberg sieve, a method well adapted in particular to providing auxiliary upper bounds, and which contributed to Chen&#x27;s theorem, among other important results.

In 1948 Selberg submitted two papers in &quot;Annals of Mathematics&quot; in which he proved by elementary means the theorems for primes in arithmetic progression and the density of primes. This challenged the widely held view of his time that certain theorems are only obtainable with the advanced methods of complex analysis. Both results were based on his work on the asymptotic formula
:formula_2
where
:formula_3
for primes formula_4. He established this result by elementary means in March 1948, and by July of that year, Selberg and Paul Erdős each obtained elementary proofs of the prime number theorem, both using the asymptotic formula above as a starting point. Circumstances leading up to the proofs, as well as publication disagreements, led to a bitter dispute between the two mathematicians.

For his fundamental accomplishments during the 1940s, Selberg received the 1950 Fields Medal.

== Institute for Advanced Study ==
Selberg moved to the United States and worked as an associate professor at Syracuse University and later settled at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey in the 1950s, where he remained until his death. During the 1950s he worked on introducing spectral theory into number theory, culminating in his development of the Selberg trace formula, the most famous and influential of his results. In its simplest form, this establishes a duality between the lengths of closed geodesics on a compact Riemann surface and the eigenvalues of the Laplacian, which is analogous to the duality between the prime numbers and the zeros of the zeta function.

He generally worked alone. His only coauthor was Sarvadaman Chowla.

Selberg was awarded the 1986 Wolf Prize in Mathematics. He was also awarded an honorary Abel Prize in 2002, its founding year, before the awarding of the regular prizes began.

Selberg received many distinctions for his work, in addition to the Fields Medal, the Wolf Prize and the Gunnerus Medal. He was elected to the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters, the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

In 1972, he was awarded an honorary degree, doctor philos. honoris causa, at the Norwegian Institute of Technology, later part of Norwegian University of Science and Technology.

His first wife, Hedvig, died in 1995. With her, Selberg had two children: Ingrid Selberg (married to playwright Mustapha Matura) and Lars Selberg. In 2003 Atle Selberg married Betty Frances (&quot;Mickey&quot;) Compton (born in 1929).

He died at home in Princeton, New Jersey on 6 August 2007 of heart failure. Upon his death he was survived by his widow, daughter, son, and four grandchildren.

<doc id="2023" wikidata="Q40939" url="?curid=2023" title="Aeschylus">
<text>Aeschylus (, ; ; /524 – /455 BC) was an ancient Greek tragedian often described as the father of tragedy. Academic knowledge of the genre begins with his work, and understanding of earlier Greek tragedy is largely based on inferences made from reading his surviving plays. According to Aristotle, he expanded the number of characters in the theatre and allowed conflict among them. Formerly, characters interacted only with the chorus.

Only seven of Aeschylus&#x27;s estimated 70 to 90 plays have survived in complete form. There is a long-standing debate regarding the authorship of one of them, &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;, with some scholars arguing that it may be the work of his son Euphorion. Fragments from other plays have survived in quotations, and more continue to be discovered on Egyptian papyri. These fragments often give further insights into Aeschylus&#x27; work. He was likely the first dramatist to present plays as a trilogy. His &quot;Oresteia&quot; is the only extant ancient example. At least one of his plays was influenced by the Persians&#x27; second invasion of Greece (480–479 BC). This work, &quot;The Persians&quot;, is one of very few classical Greek tragedies concerned with contemporary events, and the only one extant. The significance of the war with Persia was so great to Aeschylus and the Greeks that his epitaph commemorates his participation in the Greek victory at Marathon while making no mention of his success as a playwright.

==Life==

Aeschylus was born around 525 BC in Eleusis, a small town about northwest of Athens, in the fertile valleys of western Attica. Some scholars argue that the date of Aeschylus&#x27;s birth may be based on counting back 40 years from his first victory in the Great Dionysia. His family was wealthy and well established. His father, Euphorion, was said to be a member of the Eupatridae, the ancient nobility of Attica, but this might be a fiction invented by the ancients to account for the grandeur of Aeschylus&#x27; plays.

As a youth, Aeschylus worked at a vineyard until, according to the 2nd-century AD geographer Pausanias, the god Dionysus visited him in his sleep and commanded him to turn his attention to the nascent art of tragedy. As soon as he woke, he began to write a tragedy, and his first performance took place in 499 BC, when he was 26 years old. He won his first victory at the Dionysia in 484 BC.

In 510 BC, when Aeschylus was 15 years old, Cleomenes I expelled the sons of Peisistratus from Athens, and Cleisthenes came to power. Cleisthenes&#x27; reforms included a system of registration that emphasized the importance of the deme over family tradition. In the last decade of the 6th century, Aeschylus and his family were living in the deme of Eleusis.

The Persian Wars played a large role in Aeschylus&#x27; life and career. In 490 BC, he and his brother Cynegeirus fought to defend Athens against the invading army of Darius I of Persia at the Battle of Marathon. The Athenians emerged triumphant, and the victory was celebrated across the city-states of Greece. Cynegeirus was killed while trying to prevent a Persian ship retreating from the shore, for which his countrymen extolled him as a hero.

In 480 BC, Aeschylus was called into military service again, together with his younger brother Ameinias, against Xerxes I&#x27;s invading forces at the Battle of Salamis. Aeschylus also fought at the Battle of Plataea in 479 BC. Ion of Chios was a witness for Aeschylus&#x27; war record and his contribution in Salamis. Salamis holds a prominent place in &quot;The Persians&quot;, his oldest surviving play, which was performed in 472 BC and won first prize at the Dionysia.

Aeschylus was one of many Greeks who were initiated into the Eleusinian Mysteries, an ancient cult of Demeter based in his home town of Eleusis. According to Aristotle, Aeschylus was accused of asebeia (impiety) for revealing some of the cult&#x27;s secrets on stage.

Other sources claim that an angry mob tried to kill Aeschylus on the spot but he fled the scene. Heracleides of Pontus asserts that the audience tried to stone Aeschylus. Aeschylus took refuge at the altar in the orchestra of the Theater of Dionysus. He pleaded ignorance at his trial. He was acquitted, with the jury sympathetic to the military service of him and his brothers during the Persian Wars. According to the 2nd-century AD author Aelian, Aeschylus&#x27; younger brother Ameinias helped to acquit Aeschylus by showing the jury the stump of the hand he had lost at Salamis, where he was voted bravest warrior. The truth is that the award for bravery at Salamis went not to Aeschylus&#x27; brother but to Ameinias of Pallene.

Aeschylus travelled to Sicily once or twice in the 470s BC, having been invited by Hiero I, tyrant of Syracuse, a major Greek city on the eastern side of the island. He produced &quot;The Women of Aetna&quot; during one of these trips (in honor of the city founded by Hieron), and restaged his &quot;Persians&quot;. By 473 BC, after the death of Phrynichus, one of his chief rivals, Aeschylus was the yearly favorite in the Dionysia, winning first prize in nearly every competition. In 472 BC, Aeschylus staged the production that included the &quot;Persians&quot;, with Pericles serving as &quot;choregos&quot;.

==Personal life==
Aeschylus married and had two sons, Euphorion and Euaeon, both of whom became tragic poets. Euphorion won first prize in 431 BC in competition against both Sophocles and Euripides. A nephew of Aeschylus, Philocles (his sister&#x27;s son), was also a tragic poet, and won first prize in the competition against Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;. Aeschylus had at least two brothers, Cynegeirus and Ameinias.

==Death==
In 458 BC, Aeschylus returned to Sicily for the last time, visiting the city of Gela, where he died in 456 or 455 BC. Valerius Maximus wrote that he was killed outside the city by a tortoise dropped by an eagle which had mistaken his head for a rock suitable for shattering the shell, and killed him. Pliny, in his &quot;Naturalis Historiæ&quot;, adds that Aeschylus had been staying outdoors to avoid a prophecy that he would be killed by a falling object, but this story may be legendary and due to a misunderstanding of the iconography on Aeschylus&#x27; tomb. Aeschylus&#x27; work was so respected by the Athenians that after his death his tragedies were the only ones allowed to be restaged in subsequent competitions. His sons Euphorion and Euæon and his nephew Philocles also became playwrights.

The inscription on Aeschylus&#x27; gravestone makes no mention of his theatrical renown, commemorating only his military achievements:
==Works==
The seeds of Greek drama were sown in religious festivals for the gods, chiefly Dionysus, the god of wine. During Aeschylus&#x27; lifetime, dramatic competitions became part of the City Dionysia, held in spring. The festival opened with a procession which was followed by a competition of boys singing dithyrambs, and all culminated in a pair of dramatic competitions. The first competition Aeschylus would have participated in involved three playwrights each presenting three tragedies and one satyr play. A second competition involving five comedic playwrights followed, and the winners of both competitions were chosen by a panel of judges.

Aeschylus entered many of these competitions, and various ancient sources attribute between seventy and ninety plays to him. Only seven tragedies attributed to him have survived intact: &quot;The Persians&quot;, &quot;Seven Against Thebes&quot;, &quot;The Suppliants&quot;, the trilogy known as &quot;The Oresteia&quot; (the three tragedies &quot;Agamemnon&quot;, &quot;The Libation Bearers&quot; and &quot;The Eumenides&quot;), and &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; (whose authorship is disputed). With the exception of this last play – the success of which is uncertain – all of Aeschylus&#x27;s extant tragedies are known to have won first prize at the City Dionysia.

The Alexandrian &quot;Life of Aeschylus&quot; claims that he won the first prize at the City Dionysia thirteen times. This compares favorably with Sophocles&#x27; reported eighteen victories (with a substantially larger catalogue, an estimated 120 plays), and dwarfs the five victories of Euripides, who is thought to have written roughly 90 plays.

===Trilogies===
One hallmark of Aeschylean dramaturgy appears to have been his tendency to write connected trilogies in which each play serves as a chapter in a continuous dramatic narrative. The &quot;Oresteia&quot; is the only extant example of this type of connected trilogy, but there is evidence that Aeschylus often wrote such trilogies. The satyr plays that followed his tragic trilogies also drew from myth.

The satyr play Proteus, which followed the &quot;Oresteia&quot;, treated the story of Menelaus&#x27; detour in Egypt on his way home from the Trojan War. It is assumed, based on the evidence provided by a catalogue of Aeschylean play titles, scholia, and play fragments recorded by later authors, that three other extant plays of his were components of connected trilogies: &quot;Seven Against Thebes&quot; was the final play in an Oedipus trilogy, and &quot;The Suppliants&quot; and &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; were each the first play in a Danaid trilogy and Prometheus trilogy, respectively. Scholars have also suggested several completely lost trilogies, based on known play titles. A number of these treated myths about the Trojan War. One, collectively called the &quot;Achilleis&quot;, comprised &quot;Myrmidons&quot;, &quot;Nereids&quot; and &quot;Phrygians&quot; (alternately, &quot;The Ransoming of Hector&quot;).

Another trilogy apparently recounted the entrance of the Trojan ally Memnon into the war, and his death at the hands of Achilles (&quot;Memnon&quot; and &quot;The Weighing of Souls&quot; being two components of the trilogy). &quot;The Award of the Arms&quot;, &quot;The Phrygian Women&quot;, and &quot;The Salaminian Women&quot; suggest a trilogy about the madness and subsequent suicide of the Greek hero Ajax. Aeschylus seems to have written about Odysseus&#x27; return to Ithaca after the war (including his killing of his wife Penelope&#x27;s suitors and its consequences) in a trilogy consisting of &quot;The Soul-raisers&quot;, &quot;Penelope&quot;, and &quot;The Bone-gatherers&quot;. Other suggested trilogies touched on the myth of Jason and the Argonauts (&quot;Argô&quot;, &quot;Lemnian Women&quot;, &quot;Hypsipylê&quot;), the life of Perseus (&quot;The Net-draggers&quot;, &quot;Polydektês&quot;, &quot;Phorkides&quot;), the birth and exploits of Dionysus (&quot;Semele&quot;, &quot;Bacchae&quot;, &quot;Pentheus&quot;), and the aftermath of the war portrayed in &quot;Seven Against Thebes&quot; (&quot;Eleusinians&quot;, &quot;Argives&quot; (or &quot;Argive Women&quot;), &quot;Sons of the Seven&quot;).

==Surviving plays==
===&quot;The Persians&quot; (472 BC)===
&quot;The Persians&quot; (&quot;Persai&quot;) is the earliest of Aeschylus&#x27; extant plays. It was performed in 472 BC. It was based on Aeschylus&#x27; own experiences, specifically the Battle of Salamis. It is unique among surviving Greek tragedies in that it describes a recent historical event. &quot;The Persians&quot; focuses on the popular Greek theme of hubris and blames Persia&#x27;s loss on the pride of its king.

It opens with the arrival of a messenger in Susa, the Persian capital, bearing news of the catastrophic Persian defeat at Salamis, to Atossa, the mother of the Persian King Xerxes. Atossa then travels to the tomb of Darius, her husband, where his ghost appears, to explain the cause of the defeat. It is, he says, the result of Xerxes&#x27; hubris in building a bridge across the Hellespont, an action which angered the gods. Xerxes appears at the end of the play, not realizing the cause of his defeat, and the play closes to lamentations by Xerxes and the chorus.

===&quot;Seven Against Thebes&quot; (467 BC)===

&quot;Seven against Thebes&quot; (&quot;Hepta epi Thebas&quot;) was performed in 467 BC. It has the contrasting theme of the interference of the gods in human affairs. Another theme, with which Aeschylus&#x27; would continually involve himself, makes its first known appearance in this play, namely that the polis was a key development of human civilization.

The play tells the story of Eteocles and Polynices, the sons of the shamed king of Thebes, Oedipus. Eteocles and Polynices agree to share and alternate the throne of the city. After the first year, Eteocles refuses to step down. Polynices therefore undertakes war. The pair kill each other in single combat, and the original ending of the play consisted of lamentations for the dead brothers. But a new ending was added to the play some fifty years later: Antigone and Ismene mourn their dead brothers, a messenger enters announcing an edict prohibiting the burial of Polynices, and Antigone declares her intention to defy this edict. The play was the third in a connected Oedipus trilogy. The first two plays were &quot;Laius&quot; and &quot;Oedipus&quot;. The concluding satyr play was &quot;The Sphinx&quot;.

===&quot;The Suppliants&quot; (463 BC)===
Aeschylus continued his emphasis on the polis with &quot;The Suppliants&quot; (&quot;Hiketides&quot;) in 463 BC. The play gives tribute to the democratic undercurrents which were running through Athens and preceding the establishment of a democratic government in 461. The Danaids (50 daughters of Danaus, founder of Argos) flee a forced marriage to their cousins in Egypt. They turn to King Pelasgus of Argos for protection, but Pelasgus refuses until the people of Argos weigh in on the decision (a distinctly democratic move on the part of the king). The people decide that the Danaids deserve protection and are allowed within the walls of Argos despite Egyptian protests.

A Danaid trilogy had long been assumed because of &quot;The Suppliants&quot;&#x27; cliffhanger ending. This was confirmed by the 1952 publication of Oxyrhynchus Papyrus 2256 fr. 3. The constituent plays are generally agreed to be &quot;The Suppliants&quot;, &quot;The Egyptians&quot; and &quot;The Danaids&quot;. A plausible reconstruction of the trilogy&#x27;s last two-thirds runs thus: In &quot;The Egyptians&quot;, the Argive-Egyptian war threatened in the first play has transpired. King Pelasgus was killed during the war, and Danaus rules Argos. Danaus negotiates a settlement with Aegyptus, a condition of which requires his 50 daughters to marry the 50 sons of Aegyptus. Danaus secretly informs his daughters of an oracle which predicts that one of his sons-in-law would kill him. He orders the Danaids to murder their husbands therefore on their wedding night. His daughters agree. &quot;The Danaids&quot; would open the day after the wedding.

It is revealed that 49 of the 50 Danaids killed their husbands. Hypermnestra did not kill her husband, Lynceus, and helped him escape. Danaus is angered by his daughter&#x27;s disobedience and orders her imprisonment and possibly execution. In the trilogy&#x27;s climax and dénouement, Lynceus reveals himself to Danaus and kills him, thus fulfilling the oracle. He and Hypermnestra will establish a ruling dynasty in Argos. The other 49 Danaids are absolved of their murders, and married off to unspecified Argive men. The satyr play following this trilogy was titled &quot;Amymone&quot;, after one of the Danaids.
===&quot;The Oresteia&quot; (458 BC)===

Besides a few missing lines, the &quot;Oresteia&quot; of 458 BC is the only complete trilogy of Greek plays by any playwright still extant (of &quot;Proteus&quot;, the satyr play which followed, only fragments are known). &quot;Agamemnon&quot; and &quot;The Libation Bearers&quot; (&quot;Choephoroi&quot;) and &quot;The Eumenides&quot; together tell the violent story of the family of Agamemnon, king of Argos.

====&quot;Agamemnon&quot;====
Aeschylus begins in Greece, describing the return of King Agamemnon from his victory in the Trojan War, from the perspective of the townspeople (the Chorus) and his wife, Clytemnestra. Dark foreshadowings build to the death of the king at the hands of his wife, who was angry that their daughter Iphigenia was killed so that the gods would restore the winds and allow the Greek fleet to sail to Troy. Clytemnestra was also unhappy that Agamemnon kept the Trojan prophetess Cassandra as his concubine. Cassandra foretells the murder of Agamemnon and of herself to the assembled townsfolk, who are horrified. She then enters the palace knowing that she cannot avoid her fate. The ending of the play includes a prediction of the return of Orestes, son of Agamemnon, who will seek to avenge his father.

====&quot;The Libation Bearers&quot;====
&quot;The Libation Bearers&quot; opens with Orestes&#x27; arrival at Agamemnon&#x27;s tomb, from exile in Phocis. Electra meets Orestes there. They plan revenge against Clytemnestra and her lover, Aegisthus. Clytemnestra&#x27;s account of a nightmare in which she gives birth to a snake is recounted by the chorus. This leads her to order her daughter, Electra, to pour libations on Agamemnon&#x27;s tomb (with the assistance of libation bearers) in hope of making amends. Orestes enters the palace pretending to bear news of his own death. Clytemnestra calls in Aegisthus to learn the news. Orestes kills them both. Orestes is then beset by the Furies, who avenge the murders of kin in Greek mythology.

====&quot;The Eumenides&quot;====
The third play addresses the question of Orestes&#x27; guilt. The Furies drive Orestes from Argos and into the wilderness. He makes his way to the temple of Apollo and begs Apollo to drive the Furies away. Apollo had encouraged Orestes to kill Clytemnestra, so he bears some of the guilt for the murder. Apollo sends Orestes to the temple of Athena with Hermes as a guide.

The Furies track him down, and Athena steps in and declares that a trial is necessary. Apollo argues Orestes&#x27; case, and after the judges (including Athena) deliver a tie vote, Athena announces that Orestes is acquitted. She renames the Furies &quot;The Eumenides&quot; (The Good-spirited, or Kindly Ones), and extols the importance of reason in the development of laws. As in &quot;The Suppliants&quot;, the ideals of a democratic Athens are praised.

===&quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; (date disputed)===

&quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; is attributed to Aeschylus by ancient authorities. Since the late 19th century, however, scholars have increasingly doubted this ascription, largely on stylistic grounds. Its production date is also in dispute, with theories ranging from the 480s BC to as late as the 410s.

The play consists mostly of static dialogue. The Titan Prometheus is bound to a rock throughout, which is his punishment from the Olympian Zeus for providing fire to humans. The god Hephaestus and the Titan Oceanus and the chorus of Oceanids all express sympathy for Prometheus&#x27; plight. Prometheus is met by Io, a fellow victim of Zeus&#x27; cruelty. He prophesies her future travels, revealing that one of her descendants will free Prometheus. The play closes with Zeus sending Prometheus into the abyss because Prometheus will not tell him of a potential marriage which could prove Zeus&#x27; downfall.

&quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; seems to have been the first play in a trilogy, the &quot;Prometheia&quot;. In the second play, &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot;, Heracles frees Prometheus from his chains and kills the eagle that had been sent daily to eat Prometheus&#x27; perpetually regenerating liver, then believed the source of feeling. We learn that Zeus has released the other Titans which he imprisoned at the conclusion of the Titanomachy, perhaps foreshadowing his eventual reconciliation with Prometheus.

In the trilogy&#x27;s conclusion, &quot;Prometheus the Fire-Bringer&quot;, it seems that the Titan finally warns Zeus not to sleep with the sea nymph Thetis, for she is fated to beget a son greater than the father. Not wishing to be overthrown, Zeus marries Thetis off to the mortal Peleus. The product of that union is Achilles, Greek hero of the Trojan War. After reconciling with Prometheus, Zeus probably inaugurates a festival in his honor at Athens.

==Lost plays==
Of Aeschylus&#x27; other plays, only titles and assorted fragments are known. There are enough fragments (along with comments made by later authors and scholiasts) to produce rough synopses for some plays.

===&quot;Myrmidons&quot;===
This play was based on books 9 and 16 of the &quot;Iliad&quot;. Achilles sits in silent indignation over his humiliation at Agamemnon&#x27;s hands for most of the play. Envoys from the Greek army attempt to reconcile Achilles to Agamemnon, but he yields only to Patroclus, who then battles the Trojans in Achilles&#x27; armour. The bravery and death of Patroclus are reported in a messenger&#x27;s speech, which is followed by mourning.

===&quot;Nereids&quot;===
This play was based on books 18 and 19 and 22 of the &quot;Iliad&quot;. It follows the Daughters of Nereus, the sea god, who lament Patroclus&#x27; death. A messenger tells how Achilles (perhaps reconciled to Agamemnon and the Greeks) slew Hector.

===&quot;Phrygians&quot;, or &quot;Hector&#x27;s Ransom&quot;===
After a brief discussion with Hermes, Achilles sits in silent mourning over Patroclus. Hermes then brings in King Priam of Troy, who wins over Achilles and ransoms his son&#x27;s body in a spectacular . A scale is brought on stage and Hector&#x27;s body is placed in one scale and gold in the other. The dynamic dancing of the chorus of Trojans when they enter with Priam is reported by Aristophanes.

===&quot;Niobe&quot;===
The children of Niobe, the heroine, have been slain by Apollo and Artemis because Niobe had gloated that she had more children than their mother, Leto. Niobe sits in silent mourning on stage during most of the play. In the &quot;Republic&quot;, Plato quotes the line &quot;God plants a fault in mortals when he wills to destroy a house utterly.&quot;

==Influence==
===Influence on Greek drama and culture===

The theatre was just beginning to evolve when Aeschylus started writing for it. Earlier playwrights such as Thespis had already expanded the cast to include an actor who was able to interact with the chorus. Aeschylus added a second actor, allowing for greater dramatic variety, while the chorus played a less important role. He is sometimes credited with introducing &quot;skenographia&quot;, or scene-decoration, though Aristotle gives this distinction to Sophocles. Aeschylus is also said to have made the costumes more elaborate and dramatic, and made his actors wear platform boots (&quot;cothurni&quot;) to make them more visible to the audience. According to a later account of Aeschylus&#x27; life, the chorus of Furies in the first performance of the &quot;Eumenides&quot; were so frightening when they entered that children fainted, patriarchs urinated, pregnant women went into labour.

Aeschylus wrote his plays in verse. No violence is performed onstage. The plays have a remoteness from daily life in Athens, relating stories about the gods, or being set, like &quot;The Persians&quot;, far away. Aeschylus&#x27; work has a strong moral and religious emphasis. The &quot;Oresteia&quot; trilogy concentrated on humans&#x27; position in the cosmos relative to the gods and divine law and divine punishment.

Aeschylus&#x27; popularity is evident in the praise that the comic playwright Aristophanes gives him in &quot;The Frogs&quot;, produced some 50 years after Aeschylus&#x27; death. Aeschylus appears as a character in the play and claims, at line 1022, that his &quot;Seven against Thebes&quot; &quot;made everyone watching it to love being warlike&quot;. He claims, at lines 1026–7, that with &quot;The Persians&quot; he &quot;taught the Athenians to desire always to defeat their enemies.&quot; Aeschylus goes on to say, at lines 1039ff., that his plays inspired the Athenians to be brave and virtuous.

===Influence outside Greek culture===
Aeschylus&#x27; works were influential beyond his own time. Hugh Lloyd-Jones draws attention to Richard Wagner&#x27;s reverence of Aeschylus. Michael Ewans argues in his &quot;Wagner and Aeschylus. The Ring and the Oresteia&quot; (London: Faber. 1982) that the influence was so great as to merit a direct character by character comparison between Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Ring&quot; and Aeschylus&#x27;s &quot;Oresteia&quot;. But a critic of that book, while not denying that Wagner read and respected Aeschylus, has described the arguments as unreasonable and forced.

J.T. Sheppard argues in the second half of his &quot;Aeschylus and Sophocles: Their Work and Influence&quot; that Aeschylus and Sophocles have played a major part in the formation of dramatic literature from the Renaissance to the present, specifically in French and Elizabethan drama. He also claims that their influence went beyond just drama and applies to literature in general, citing Milton and the Romantics.

Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;Mourning Becomes Electra&quot; (1931), a trilogy of three plays set in America after the Civil War, is modeled after the &quot;Oresteia&quot;. Before writing his acclaimed trilogy, O&#x27;Neill had been developing a play about Aeschylus, and he noted that Aeschylus &quot;so changed the system of the tragic stage that he has more claim than anyone else to be regarded as the founder (Father) of Tragedy.&quot;

During his presidential campaign in 1968, Senator Robert F. Kennedy quoted the Edith Hamilton translation of Aeschylus on the night of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. Kennedy was notified of King&#x27;s murder before a campaign stop in Indianapolis, Indiana, and was warned not to attend the event due to fears of rioting from the mostly African-American crowd. Kennedy insisted on attending and delivered an impromptu speech that delivered news of King&#x27;s death. Acknowledging the audience&#x27;s emotions, Kennedy referred to his own grief at the murder of Martin Luther King and, quoting a passage from the play &quot;Agamemnon&quot; (in translation), said: &quot;My favorite poet was Aeschylus. And he once wrote: &#x27;Even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart, until in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God.&#x27; What we need in the United States is not division; what we need in the United States is not hatred; what we need in the United States is not violence and lawlessness; but is love and wisdom, and compassion toward one another, and a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our country, whether they be white or whether they be black ... Let us dedicate ourselves to what the Greeks wrote so many years ago: to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of this world.&quot;
 The quotation from Aeschylus was later inscribed on a memorial at the gravesite of Robert Kennedy following his own assassination.

<text>The Amber Road was an ancient trade route for the transfer of amber from coastal areas of the North Sea and the Baltic Sea to the Mediterranean Sea. Prehistoric trade routes between Northern and Southern Europe were defined by the amber trade.

As an important commodity, sometimes dubbed &quot;the gold of the north&quot;, amber was transported from the North Sea and Baltic Sea coasts overland by way of the Vistula and Dnieper rivers to Italy, Greece, the Black Sea, Syria and Egypt over a period of thousands of years.

==Antiquity==
The oldest trade in amber started from Sicily. The Sicilian amber trade was directed to Greece, North Africa and Spain. Sicilian amber was also discovered in Mycenae by the archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann, and it appeared in sites in southern Spain and Portugal. Its distribution is similar to that of ivory, so it is possible that amber from Sicily reached the Iberian Peninsula through contacts with North Africa. After a decline in the consumption and trade of amber at the beginning of the Bronze Age, around 2000 BC, the influence of Baltic amber gradually took the place of Sicilian amber throughout the Iberian Peninsula from around 1000 BC. The new evidence comes from various archaeological and geological locations on the Iberian Peninsula.

From at least the 16th century BC, amber was moved from Northern Europe to the Mediterranean area. The breast ornament of the Egyptian Pharaoh Tutankhamen ( BC) contains large Baltic amber beads. Schliemann found Baltic amber beads at Mycenae, as shown by spectroscopic investigation. The quantity of amber in the Royal Tomb of Qatna, Syria, is unparalleled among known second millennium BC sites in the Levant and the Ancient Near East. Amber was sent from the North Sea to the Temple of Apollo at Delphi as an offering. From the Black Sea, trade could continue to Asia along the Silk Road, another ancient trade route.

In Roman times, a main route ran south from the Baltic coast (modern Lithuania), the entire north–south length of modern-day Poland (likely through the Iron Age settlement of Biskupin), through the land of the Boii (modern Czech Republic and Slovakia) to the head of the Adriatic Sea (Aquileia by the modern Gulf of Venice). Other commodities were exported to the Romans along with amber, such as animal fur and skin, honey, and wax, in exchange for Roman glass, brass, gold, and non-ferrous metals such as tin and copper imported into the early Baltic region. As this road was a lucrative trade route connecting the Baltic Sea to the Mediterranean Sea, Roman military fortifications were constructed along the route to protect merchants and traders from Germanic raids.

The Old Prussian towns of Kaup and Truso on the Baltic were the starting points of the route to the south. In Scandinavia the amber road probably gave rise to the thriving Nordic Bronze Age culture, bringing influences from the Mediterranean Sea to the northernmost countries of Europe.

Kaliningrad Oblast is occasionally referred to in Russian as , which means &quot;the amber region&quot; (see Kaliningrad Regional Amber Museum).

==Known roads by country==

===Estonia===
Old coastal Amber road route goes along E67 highway from Reiu in Häädemeeste Parish of Pärnumaa South, where it continues as 331 local road between Rannametsa and Ikla villages.

===Poland===
The shortest (and possibly oldest) road avoids alpine areas and led from the Baltic coastline (nowadays Lithuania and Poland), through Biskupin, Milicz, Wrocław, the Kłodzko Valley (less often through the Moravian Gate), crossed the Danube near Carnuntum in the Noricum province, headed southwest past Poetovio, Celeia, Emona, Nauportus, and reached Patavium and Aquileia at the Adriatic coast. One of the oldest directions of the last stage of the Amber Road to the south of the Danube, noted in the myth about the Argonauts, used the rivers Sava and Kupa, ending with a short continental road from Nauportus to Tarsatica in Rijeka on the coast of the Adriatic.

===Germany===

Several roads connected the North Sea and Baltic Sea, especially the city of Hamburg to the Brenner Pass, proceeding southwards to Brindisi (nowadays Italy) and Ambracia (nowadays Greece).

===Switzerland===
The Swiss region indicates a number of alpine roads, concentrating around the capital city Bern and probably originating from the banks of the Rhône and Rhine.

===The Netherlands===
A small section, including Baarn, Barneveld, Amersfoort and Amerongen, connected the North Sea with the Lower Rhine.

===Belgium===
A small section led southwards from Antwerp and Bruges to the towns Braine-l&#x27;Alleud and Braine-le-Comte, both originally named &quot;Brennia-Brenna&quot;. The route continued by following the Meuse towards Bern in Switzerland.

===Southern France and Spain===
Routes connected amber finding locations at Ambares (near Bordeaux), leading to Béarn and the Pyrenees. Routes connecting the amber finding locations in northern Spain and in the Pyrenees were a trading route to the Mediterranean Sea.

===Mongolia===
Sources of archaeological finds suggest that routes may also have connected Mongolia to eastern Europe during the Kitan/Liao Period.

==Modern usage==
There is a tourist route stretching along the Baltic coast from Kaliningrad to Latvia called &quot;Amber Road&quot;.

&quot;Amber Road&quot; sites are:
* Mizgiris Amber Gallery-Museum in Nida;
* Amber Bay in Juodkrantė;
* Lithuania Minor History Museum;
* Amber collection place in Karklė, Lithuania;

* Amber deposit from Partynice - Dating from the 1st century BC amber deposit found in Wrocław. It is the world&#x27;s largest archaeological find of amber, estimated at 1,240–1,760 kg. Currently it is in the Archaeological Museum in Wrocław. 

In Poland, the north–south motorway A1 is officially named Amber Highway.

EV9 The Amber Route is a long-distance cycling route between Gdańsk, Poland and Pula, Croatia which follows the course of the Amber Road.

The modern Baltic–Adriatic Corridor connects the two seas along routes that roughly follow the Amber Road.

<text>Crandall University is a Baptist Christian liberal arts university located in Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada. It is affiliated with the Canadian Baptists of Atlantic Canada (Canadian Baptist Ministries).

==History==

Crandall University was founded in 1949 under the name United Baptist Bible Training School (UBBTS), and served as both a secondary school and a Bible school by the Canadian Baptists of Atlantic Canada. Over two decades, the focus of the school gradually shifted toward post-secondary programs. In 1968, UBBTS became a Bible and junior Christian liberal arts college, and in 1970 the name was changed to Atlantic Baptist College (ABC). A sustained campaign to expand the school&#x27;s faculty and improve the level of education resulted in ABC being able to grant full Bachelor of Arts degrees in 1983. Its campus at this time was located along the Salisbury Road, west of Moncton&#x27;s central business district.

The institution moved to a new campus built on the Gorge Road, north of the central business district, in 1996. The name was changed to Atlantic Baptist University (ABU), a reflection of expanded student enrolment and academic accreditation. In 2003, the ABU sports teams adopted the name &quot;The Blue Tide&quot;. The institution was the first, and thus far only, English-language university in Moncton. The &quot;Atlantic Baptist University Act&quot; was passed by the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick in 2008.

On August 21, 2009, it was announced that the institution had changed its name to Crandall University in honour of Rev. Joseph Crandall, a pioneering Baptist minister in the maritime region. In conjunction with the university name change, Crandall Athletics took on a new identity as &quot;The Crandall Chargers.&quot;

==Academics==
, Crandall offers 16 undergraduate programs, 3 graduate programs, and a variety of certificate programs. Through its partnership with Acadia Divinity College, students can also enrol in the Bachelor of Theology program concurrent with a Crandall degree. Crandall has a 13:1 student-to-faculty ratio.

==Controversy==
In 2012, Crandall University came under public scrutiny for receiving municipal funds for having a scripturally based hiring policy consistent with its denomination&#x27;s tradition, that is, forbidding the hiring of non-celibate LGBTQ people. This has been characterized by the press as an anti-gay hiring policy. That same year, the Crandall Student Association publicly broke with the university&#x27;s administration over the policy, with the student president at the time telling the CBC, &quot;The Christian faith does say do not judge others. And the Christian faith is all about love. So I feel that this policy – to me – doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s following those specific guidelines.&quot; In 2013, a year after the controversy erupted, the university opted to not apply for $150,000 in public funding that it had received annually. The university president also issued an apology, stating: &quot;We wish to apologize for anything that Crandall University might possibly have communicated in the past that may have seemed unloving or disrespectful in any way toward any individual or groups.&quot;

Another notable controversy was the time when Charlie the Charger was found attending class at Kingswood University in Sussex, NB. Come on, Charlie.

==Affiliations==
Crandall is an affiliate member of the Association of the Registrars of the Universities and Colleges of Canada (ARUCC); a full member of the ARUCC regional association, the Atlantic Association of Registrars and Admissions Officers (AARAO); an active member of Christian Higher Education Canada (CHEC); and an active member of the New Brunswick Association of Private Colleges and Universities. However, Crandall faculty are not members of the Canadian Association of University Teachers (CAUT). In their report, the CAUT found that &quot;while the university has a statement on academic freedom, it is significantly inconsistent with that of the CAUT and the majority of universities across the western world, and assurances that free enquiry is still possible within its constraints are unconvincing.&quot; They therefore recommended that Crandall University &quot;be placed on the list of institutions &#x27;found to have imposed a requirement of a commitment to a particular ideology or statement of faith as a condition of employment.&#x27;&quot;

The university is affiliated with the Canadian Baptists of Atlantic Canada (Canadian Baptist Ministries). It is a member of the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities.

==Library and archives==
Crandall University houses the Baptist Heritage Center whose 300 artifacts preserve the material history of Atlantic Baptists, the Convention of Atlantic Baptist Churches, and its predecessor organizations. The collection and archives includes objects used in worship services, furniture, musical instruments, church building architecture pictures and printed material.

==Athletics==
Crandall University is represented in the Atlantic Collegiate Athletic Association (ACAA) by 8 varsity teams. The Chargers teams include men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer, basketball, volleyball, and cross country. The Chargers also offer a boxing club program that competes internationally. Lydia MacArthur did in fact run for Crandall University.

The Chargers have won seven ACAA championship banners:
* Women&#x27;s soccer in 2003–04
* Women&#x27;s cross country in 2022–23 and 2023–24
* Men&#x27;s cross country in 2021–22, 2022-23, 2023-24, and 2024-25

==Notable alumni==
*David Alward – former Premier of New Brunswick
*Ken LeBlanc – entrepreneur
*Ralph Richardson – first chancellor of the university
*Cathy Rogers – politician

<doc id="2027" wikidata="Q184433" url="?curid=2027" title="Andrew Wiles">
<text>Sir Andrew John Wiles (born 11 April 1953) is an English mathematician and a Royal Society Research Professor at the University of Oxford, specialising in number theory. He is best known for proving Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem, for which he was awarded the 2016 Abel Prize and the 2017 Copley Medal and for which he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2000. In 2018, Wiles was appointed the first Regius Professor of Mathematics at Oxford. Wiles is also a 1997 MacArthur Fellow.

Wiles was born in Cambridge to theologian Maurice Frank Wiles and Patricia Wiles. While spending much of his childhood in Nigeria, Wiles developed an interest in mathematics and in Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem in particular. After moving to Oxford and graduating from there in 1974, he worked on unifying Galois representations, elliptic curves and modular forms, starting with Barry Mazur&#x27;s generalizations of Iwasawa theory. In the early 1980s, Wiles spent a few years at the University of Cambridge before moving to Princeton University, where he worked on expanding out and applying Hilbert modular forms. In 1986, upon reading Ken Ribet&#x27;s seminal work on Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem, Wiles set out to prove the modularity theorem for semistable elliptic curves, which implied Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem. By 1993, he had been able to convince a knowledgeable colleague that he had a proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem, though a flaw was subsequently discovered. After an insight on 19 September 1994, Wiles and his student Richard Taylor were able to circumvent the flaw, and published the results in 1995, to widespread acclaim.

In proving Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem, Wiles developed new tools for mathematicians to begin unifying disparate ideas and theorems. His former student Taylor along with three other mathematicians were able to prove the full modularity theorem by 2000, using Wiles&#x27; work. Upon receiving the Abel Prize in 2016, Wiles reflected on his legacy, expressing his belief that he did not just prove Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem, but pushed the whole of mathematics as a field towards the Langlands program of unifying number theory.

==Education and early life==
Wiles was born on 11 April 1953 in Cambridge, England, the son of Maurice Frank Wiles (1923–2005) and Patricia Wiles (née Mowll). From 1952 to 1955, his father worked as the chaplain at Ridley Hall, Cambridge, and later became the Regius Professor of Divinity at the University of Oxford.

Wiles began his formal schooling in Nigeria, while living there as a very young boy with his parents. However, according to letters written by his parents, for at least the first several months after he was supposed to be attending classes, he refused to go. From that fact, Wiles himself concluded that in his earliest years, he was not enthusiastic about spending time in academic institutions. In an interview with Nadia Hasnaoui in 2021, he said he trusted the letters, yet he could not remember a time when he did not enjoy solving mathematical problems.

Wiles attended King&#x27;s College School, Cambridge, and The Leys School, Cambridge. Wiles told WGBH-TV in 1999 that he came across Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem on his way home from school when he was 10 years old. He stopped at his local library where he found a book &quot;The Last Problem&quot;, by Eric Temple Bell, about the theorem. Fascinated by the existence of a theorem that was so easy to state that he, a ten-year-old, could understand it, but that no one had proven, he decided to be the first person to prove it. However, he soon realised that his knowledge was too limited, so he abandoned his childhood dream until it was brought back to his attention at the age of 33 by Ken Ribet&#x27;s 1986 proof of the epsilon conjecture, which Gerhard Frey had previously linked to Fermat&#x27;s equation.

==Early career==
In 1974, Wiles earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in mathematics at Merton College, Oxford. Wiles&#x27;s graduate research was guided by John Coates, beginning in the summer of 1975. Together they worked on the arithmetic of elliptic curves with complex multiplication by the methods of Iwasawa theory. He further worked with Barry Mazur on the main conjecture of Iwasawa theory over the rational numbers, and soon afterward, he generalised this result to totally real fields.

In 1980, Wiles earned a PhD while at Clare College, Cambridge. After a stay at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, in 1981, Wiles became a Professor of Mathematics at Princeton University.

In 1985–86, Wiles was a Guggenheim Fellow at the Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques near Paris and at the .

In 1989, Wiles was elected to the Royal Society. At that point according to his election certificate, he had been working &quot;on the construction of ℓ-adic representations attached to Hilbert modular forms, and has applied these to prove the &#x27;main conjecture&#x27; for cyclotomic extensions of totally real fields&quot;.

==Proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem==

From 1988 to 1990, Wiles was a Royal Society Research Professor at the University of Oxford, and then he returned to Princeton.
From 1994 to 2009, Wiles was a Eugene Higgins Professor at Princeton.

Starting in mid-1986, based on successive progress of the previous few years of Gerhard Frey, Jean-Pierre Serre and Ken Ribet, it became clear that Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem (the statement that no three positive integers , , and satisfy the equation for any integer value of greater than ) could be proven as a corollary of a limited form of the modularity theorem (unproven at the time and then known as the &quot;Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture&quot;). The modularity theorem involved elliptic curves, which was also Wiles&#x27;s own specialist area, and stated that all such curves have a modular form associated with them. These curves can be thought of as mathematical objects resembling solutions for a torus&#x27; surface, and if Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem were false and solutions existed, &quot;a peculiar curve would result&quot;. A proof of the theorem therefore would involve showing that such a curve would not exist.

The conjecture was seen by contemporary mathematicians as important, but extraordinarily difficult or perhaps impossible to prove. For example, Wiles&#x27;s ex-supervisor John Coates stated that it seemed &quot;impossible to actually prove&quot;, and Ken Ribet considered himself &quot;one of the vast majority of people who believed [it] was completely inaccessible&quot;, adding that &quot;Andrew Wiles was probably one of the few people on earth who had the audacity to dream that you can actually go and prove [it].&quot;

Despite this, Wiles, with his from-childhood fascination with Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem, decided to undertake the challenge of proving the conjecture, at least to the extent needed for Frey&#x27;s curve. He dedicated all of his research time to this problem for over six years in near-total secrecy, covering up his efforts by releasing prior work in small segments as separate papers and confiding only in his wife.

Wiles&#x27; research involved creating a proof by contradiction of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem, which Ribet in his 1986 work had found to have an elliptic curve and thus an associated modular form if true. Starting by assuming that the theorem was incorrect, Wiles then contradicted the Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture as formulated under that assumption, with Ribet&#x27;s theorem (which stated that if were a prime number, no such elliptic curve could have a modular form, so no odd prime counterexample to Fermat&#x27;s equation could exist). Wiles also proved that the conjecture applied to the special case known as the semistable elliptic curves to which Fermat&#x27;s equation was tied. In other words, Wiles had found that the Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture was true in the case of Fermat&#x27;s equation, and Ribet&#x27;s finding (that the conjecture holding for semistable elliptic curves could mean Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem is true) prevailed, thus proving Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem.

In June 1993, he presented his proof to the public for the first time at a conference in Cambridge. Gina Kolata of &quot;The New York Times&quot; summed up the presentation as follows:
In August 1993, it was discovered that the proof contained a flaw in several areas, related to properties of the Selmer group and use of a tool called an Euler system. Wiles tried and failed for over a year to repair his proof. According to Wiles, the crucial idea for circumventing—rather than closing—this area came to him on 19 September 1994, when he was on the verge of giving up. The circumvention used Galois representations to replace elliptic curves, reduced the problem to a class number formula and solved it, among other matters, all using Victor Kolyvagin&#x27;s ideas as a basis for fixing Matthias Flach&#x27;s approach with Iwasawa theory. Together with his former student Richard Taylor, Wiles published a second paper which contained the circumvention and thus completed the proof. Both papers were published in May 1995 in a dedicated issue of the &quot;Annals of Mathematics.&quot;

==Later career==
In 2011, Wiles rejoined the University of Oxford as Royal Society Research Professor.

In May 2018, Wiles was appointed Regius Professor of Mathematics at Oxford, the first in the university&#x27;s history.

==Legacy==
Wiles&#x27; work has been used in many fields of mathematics. Notably, in 1999, three of his former students, Richard Taylor, Brian Conrad, and Fred Diamond, working with Christophe Breuil, built upon Wiles&#x27; proof to prove the full modularity theorem. Wiles&#x27;s doctoral students have also included Manjul Bhargava (2014 winner of the Fields Medal), Ehud de Shalit, Ritabrata Munshi (winner of the SSB Prize and ICTP Ramanujan Prize), Karl Rubin (son of Vera Rubin), Christopher Skinner, and Vinayak Vatsal (2007 winner of the Coxeter–James Prize).

In 2016, upon receiving the Abel Prize, Wiles said about his proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem, &quot;The methods that solved it opened up a new way of attacking one of the big webs of conjectures of contemporary mathematics called the Langlands Program, which as a grand vision tries to unify different branches of mathematics. It’s given us a new way to look at that&quot;.

==Awards and honours==

Wiles&#x27;s proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem has stood up to the scrutiny of the world&#x27;s other mathematical experts. Wiles was interviewed for an episode of the BBC documentary series &quot;Horizon&quot; about Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem. This was broadcast as an episode of the PBS science television series &quot;Nova&quot; with the title &quot;The Proof&quot;. His work and life are also described in great detail in Simon Singh&#x27;s popular book &quot;Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem&quot;.

In 1988, Wiles was awarded the Junior Whitehead Prize of the London Mathematical Society (1988). In 1989, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS)

In 1994, Wiles was elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Upon completing his proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem in 1995, he was awarded the Schock Prize, Fermat Prize, and Wolf Prize in Mathematics that year. Wiles was elected a Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences and won an NAS Award in Mathematics from the National Academy of Sciences, the Royal Medal, and the Ostrowski Prize in 1996. He won the American Mathematical Society&#x27;s Cole Prize, a MacArthur Fellowship, and the Wolfskehl Prize in 1997, and was elected member of the American Philosophical Society that year.

In 1998, Wiles was awarded a silver plaque from the International Mathematical Union recognising his achievements, in place of the Fields Medal, which is restricted to those under the age of 40 (Wiles was 41 when he proved the theorem in 1994). That same year, he was awarded the King Faisal Prize along with the Clay Research Award in 1999, the year the asteroid 9999 Wiles was named after him.

In 2000, he was awarded Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (2000) In 2004 Wiles won the Premio Pitagora. In 2005, he won the Shaw Prize.

The building at the University of Oxford housing the Mathematical Institute was named after Wiles in 2016. Later that year he won the Abel Prize. In 2017, Wiles won the Copley Medal. In 2019, he won the De Morgan Medal.

<text>Anne Brontë (, ; 17 January 1820 – 28 May 1849) was an English novelist and poet, the youngest member of the Brontë literary family.

Anne Brontë was the daughter of Maria ( Branwell) and Patrick Brontë, a poor Irish clergyman in the Church of England. Anne lived most of her life with her family at the parish of Haworth on the Yorkshire Dales. Otherwise, she attended a boarding school in Mirfield between 1836 and 1837, and between 1839 and 1845 lived elsewhere working as a governess. In 1846, she published a book of poems with her sisters and later two novels, initially under the pen name Acton Bell. Her first novel, &quot;Agnes Grey&quot;, was published in 1847 at the same time as &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; by her sister Emily Brontë. Anne&#x27;s second novel, &quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot;, was published in 1848. &quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot; is often considered one of the first feminist novels.

Anne died at 29, most likely of pulmonary tuberculosis. After her death, her sister Charlotte edited &quot;Agnes Grey&quot; to fix issues with its first edition, but prevented republication of &quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot;. As a result, Anne is not as well known as her sisters. Nonetheless, both of her novels are considered classics of English literature.

==Family background==

Anne&#x27;s father was Patrick Brontë. Patrick Brontë was born in a two-room cottage in Emdale, Loughbrickland, County Down, Ireland. He was the oldest of ten children born to Hugh Brunty and Eleanor McCrory, poor Irish peasant farmers. The family surname, &quot;mac Aedh Ó Proinntigh&quot;, was Anglicised as Prunty or Brunty. Struggling against poverty, Patrick learned to read and write, and from 1798 taught others. In 1802, at 25, he won a place to study theology at St. John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. Here he changed his name, Brunty, to the more distinguished sounding Brontë. In 1807, he was ordained in the priesthood in the Church of England. He served as a curate in Essex and then in Wellington, Shropshire. In 1810, he published his first poem, &quot;Winter Evening Thoughts&quot;, in a local newspaper. In 1811, he published a collection of moral verse, &quot;Cottage Poems&quot;. Also in 1811, he became vicar of St. Peter&#x27;s Church in Hartshead, Yorkshire. In 1812, he was appointed an examiner in Classics at Woodhouse Grove School, near Bradford. This was a Wesleyan academy where, at 35, he met his future wife, the headmaster&#x27;s niece, Maria Branwell.

Maria Branwell, Anne&#x27;s mother, was the daughter of Anne Carne, the daughter of a silversmith, and Thomas Branwell, a successful and property-owning grocer and tea merchant in Penzance. Maria was the eleventh of twelve children and enjoyed the benefits of a prosperous family in a small town. After the death of her parents, Maria went to help her aunt with housekeeping functions at the school. Maria was intelligent and well read, and her strong Methodist faith attracted Patrick Brontë, whose own leanings were similar.

Within three months, on 29 December 1812, though from considerably different backgrounds, Patrick Brontë and Maria Branwell were married. Their first child, Maria (1814–1825), was born after they moved to Hartshead. In 1815, Patrick was appointed curate of the chapel in Market Street Thornton, near Bradford. A second daughter, Elizabeth (1815–1825), was born shortly after. Four more children followed: Charlotte (1816–1855), Patrick Branwell (1817–1848), Emily (1818–1848), and Anne (1820–1849).

==Early life==
Anne was the youngest of the Brontë children. She was born on 17 January 1820 at the parsonage in Market Street, Thornton (now known as the Brontë Birthplace), on the outskirts of Bradford. Her father, Patrick, was curate there. Anne was baptised there on 25 March 1820. Later Patrick was appointed to the perpetual curacy in Haworth, a small town away. In April 1820 the family moved into the five-roomed Haworth Parsonage.

When Anne was barely a year old her mother, Maria, became ill, probably with uterine cancer. Maria Branwell died on 15 September 1821. Patrick tried to remarry, without success. Maria&#x27;s sister, Elizabeth Branwell, had moved to the parsonage initially for Maria, but spent the rest of her life there raising Maria&#x27;s children from a sense of duty. She was stern and expected respect, not love. There was little affection between her and the older children. According to tradition Anne was her favourite.

In Elizabeth Gaskell&#x27;s biography of Charlotte, Patrick remembered Anne as precocious. Patrick said that when Anne was four years old he had asked her what a child most wanted and that she had said: &quot;age and experience&quot;.

In summer 1824 Patrick sent daughters Maria, Elizabeth, Charlotte, and Emily to Crofton Hall in Crofton, West Yorkshire, and subsequently to the Clergy Daughter&#x27;s School at Cowan Bridge in Lancashire. Maria and Elizabeth Brontë died of tuberculosis on 6 May and 15 June 1825 respectively, and Charlotte and Emily were brought home. The unexpected deaths distressed the family so much that Patrick could not face sending them away again. They were educated at home for the next five years, largely by Elizabeth Branwell and Patrick. The children made little attempt to mix with others outside the parsonage and relied on each other for company. The bleak moors surrounding Haworth became their playground. Anne shared a room with her aunt, Elizabeth. They were close, and she may have influenced Anne&#x27;s personality and religious beliefs.

==Education==

Anne&#x27;s studies at home included music and drawing. The Keighley church organist gave piano lessons to Anne and Emily and Branwell, and John Bradley of Keighley gave them art lessons. Each drew with some skill. Their aunt tried to teach the girls how to run a household, but they inclined more to literature. They read much from their father&#x27;s well-stocked library. Their reading included the Bible, Homer, Virgil, Shakespeare, Milton, Byron, Scott, articles from &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Edinburgh Magazine&quot; and &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and &quot;The Edinburgh Review&quot;, and books of history and geography and biography.

Their reading fed their imaginations, and their creativity soared after their father gave Branwell a set of toy soldiers in June 1826. They gave names to the soldiers, or the &quot;Twelves&quot;, and developed their characters. This led to the creation of an imaginary world: the African kingdom of &quot;Angria&quot;, which was illustrated with maps and watercolour renderings. The children devised plots about the inhabitants of Angria and its capital city, &quot;Glass Town&quot;, later called Verreopolis or Verdopolis.

Their fantastical worlds and kingdoms gradually acquired characteristics from their historical world, drawing from its sovereigns, armies, heroes, outlaws, fugitives, inns, schools, and publishers. The characters and lands created by the children were given newspapers and magazines and chronicles written in tiny books with writing so small that it was difficult to read without a magnifying glass. These creations and writings were an apprenticeship for their later literary talents.

==Juvenilia==
Around 1831, when Anne was eleven, she and Emily broke away from Charlotte and Branwell to create and develop their own fantasy world, &quot;Gondal&quot;. Anne and Emily were particularly close, especially after Charlotte left for Roe Head School in January 1831. Charlotte&#x27;s friend Ellen Nussey visited Haworth in 1833 and reported that Emily and Anne were &quot;like twins&quot; and &quot;inseparable companions&quot;. She described Anne so:

Anne took lessons from Charlotte after Charlotte had returned from Roe Head. Charlotte returned to Roe Head as a teacher on 29 July 1835, accompanied by Emily as a pupil. Emily&#x27;s tuition was largely financed by Charlotte&#x27;s teaching. Emily was unable to adapt to life at school and was physically ill from homesickness within a few months. She was withdrawn from school by October and replaced by Anne.

Anne was 15 and it was her first time away from home. She made few friends at Roe Head. She was quiet and hardworking and determined to stay to acquire the education which she would need to support herself. She stayed for two years and returned home only during Christmas and summer holidays. She won a good-conduct medal in December 1836. Charlotte&#x27;s letters almost never mention Anne while Anne was at Roe Head, which might imply that they were not close, but Charlotte was at least concerned about Anne&#x27;s health. By December 1837 Anne had become seriously ill with gastritis and embroiled in religious crisis. A Moravian minister was called to see her several times during her illness, suggesting her distress was caused, in part, by conflict with the local Anglican clergy. Charlotte wrote to their father and he brought Anne home.

==Employment at Blake Hall==

A year after leaving the school, and aged 19, Anne was seeking a teaching position. She was the daughter of a poor clergyman and needed to earn money. Her father had no private income and the parsonage would revert to the church on his death. Teaching or working as a governess were among few options for a poor and educated woman. In April 1839 Anne started work as a governess for the Ingham family at Blake Hall, near Mirfield.

The children in her charge were spoiled and disobedient. Anne had great difficulty controlling them and little success in educating them. She was not allowed to punish them, and when she complained about their behaviour she received no support and was criticised for being incapable. The Inghams were dissatisfied with their children&#x27;s progress and dismissed Anne. She returned home in 1839 at Christmas. At home also were Charlotte and Emily, who had left their positions, and Branwell. Anne&#x27;s time at Blake Hall was so traumatic that she reproduced it in almost perfect detail in her novel &quot;Agnes Grey&quot;.

==William Weightman==
Anne returned to Haworth and met William Weightman, her father&#x27;s new curate who had started work in the parish in August 1839. Weightman was 25 and had obtained a two-year licentiate in theology from the University of Durham. He was welcome at the parsonage. Anne&#x27;s acquaintance with him parallels her writing a number of poems, which may suggest she fell in love with him although there is disagreement over this possibility. Little evidence exists beyond a small anecdote of Charlotte&#x27;s to Ellen Nussey in January 1842.

In &quot;Agnes Grey&quot;, Agnes&#x27; interest in the curate refreshes her interest in poetry. Outside fiction, William Weightman aroused much curiosity. It seems that he was good-looking and engaging, and that his easy humour and kindness towards the sisters made an impression. It is such a character that she portrays in Edward Weston, and that her heroine Agnes Grey finds deeply appealing.

Weightman died of cholera in the same year. Anne expressed her grief for his death in her poem &quot;I will not mourn thee, lovely one&quot;, in which she called him &quot;our darling&quot;.

==Governess==

From 1840 to 1845 Anne worked at Thorp Green Hall, a comfortable country house near York. Here she was governess to the children of the Reverend Edmund Robinson and his wife, Lydia. The house appeared as Horton Lodge in &quot;Agnes Grey&quot;. Anne had four pupils: Lydia (15), Elizabeth (13), Mary (12), and Edmund (8). She initially had problems similar to those at Blake Hall. Anne missed her home and family. In a diary paper in 1841, she wrote that she did not like her situation and wished to leave it. Her quiet and gentle disposition did not help. But Anne was determined and made a success of her position, becoming well-liked by her employers. Her charges, the Robinson girls, became lifelong friends.

Anne spent only five or six weeks a year with her family, during holidays at Christmas and in June. The rest of her time was spent with the Robinsons. She accompanied the Robinsons on annual holidays to Scarborough. Between 1840 and 1844 Anne spent around five weeks each summer at the coastal town and loved it. A number of locations in Scarborough were used for her novels. She had opportunities to collect semi-precious stones, considering an interest in geology, at least in her novels, or from personal experience, as something suitable for men and women to be considered as equals.

Anne and her sisters considered setting up a school while she was still working for the Robinsons. Various locations were considered, including the parsonage, but the project never materialised. Anne came home on the death of her aunt in early November 1842 while her sisters were in Brussels. Elizabeth Branwell left a £350 legacy (equivalent to £ in ) for each of her nieces.

It was at the Long Plantation at Thorp Green in 1842 that Anne wrote her three-verse poem &quot;Lines Composed in a Wood on a Windy Day&quot;, which was published in 1846 under the name Acton Bell.

In January 1843 Anne returned to Thorp Green and secured a position for Branwell. He was to tutor Edmund, who was growing too old to be in Anne&#x27;s care. Branwell did not live in the house as Anne did. Anne&#x27;s vaunted calm appears to have been the result of hard-fought battles, balancing deeply felt emotions with careful thought, a sense of responsibility and resolute determination. All three Brontë sisters worked as governesses or teachers, and all experienced problems controlling their charges, gaining support from their employers, and coping with homesickness, but Anne was the only one who persevered and made a success of her work.

==Back at the parsonage==

Anne and Branwell taught at Thorp Green for the next three years. Branwell entered into a secret relationship with his employer&#x27;s wife, Lydia Robinson. When Anne and Branwell returned home for the holidays in June 1845 Anne resigned. Anne gave no reason, but the reason may have been the relationship between her brother and Mrs Robinson. Branwell was dismissed when his employer found out about the relationship. Anne continued to exchange letters with Elizabeth and Mary Robinson. They came to visit Anne in December 1848.

Anne took Emily to visit some of the places which Anne had become fond of. A plan to visit Scarborough fell through, but they went to York and saw York Minster.

==A book of poems==

The Brontës were at home with their father during the summer of 1845. None had any immediate prospect of employment. Charlotte found Emily&#x27;s poems, which had been shared only with Anne. Charlotte said that they should be published. Anne showed her own poems to Charlotte, and Charlotte &quot;thought that these verses too had a sweet sincere pathos of their own&quot;. The sisters eventually reached an agreement. They told nobody what they were doing. With the money from Elizabeth Branwell they paid for publication of a collection of poems, 21 from Anne and 21 from Emily and 19 from Charlotte.

The book was published under pen names which retained their initials but concealed their sex. Anne&#x27;s pseudonym was Acton Bell. &quot;Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell&quot; was available for sale in May 1846. The cost of publication was 31 pounds and 10 shillings, about three-quarters of Anne&#x27;s salary at Thorp Green. On 7 May 1846 the first three copies were delivered to Haworth Parsonage. The book achieved three somewhat favourable reviews, but was a commercial failure, with only two copies sold in the first year. Anne nonetheless found a market for her later poetry. The &quot;Leeds Intelligencer&quot; and &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot; published her poem &quot;The Narrow Way&quot; under her pseudonym in December 1848. Four months earlier, Fraser&#x27;s Magazine had published her poem &quot;The Three Guides&quot;.

==Novels==
===&quot;Agnes Grey&quot;===

By July 1846 a package containing the manuscripts of each sister&#x27;s first novel was making the rounds of London publishers. Charlotte had written &quot;The Professor&quot;, Emily had written &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, and Anne had written &quot;Agnes Grey&quot;.

After some rejections &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; and &quot;Agnes Grey&quot; were accepted by the publisher Thomas Cautley Newby. &quot;The Professor&quot; was rejected. It was not long before Charlotte had completed her second novel, &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;. &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; was accepted immediately by Smith, Elder &amp; Co. It was the first published of the sisters&#x27; novels, and an immediate and resounding success. Meanwhile, Anne and Emily&#x27;s novels &quot;lingered in the press&quot;. Anne and Emily were obliged to pay fifty pounds to help meet their publishing costs. Their publisher was galvanised by the success of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; and published &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; and &quot;Agnes Grey&quot; together in December 1847. They sold well, but &quot;Agnes Grey&quot; was outshone by Emily&#x27;s more dramatic &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;.

===&quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot;===

 Anne&#x27;s second novel, &quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot;, was published in the last week of June 1848.

The novel challenged contemporary social and legal structures. In 1913, May Sinclair said that the slamming of Helen Huntingdon&#x27;s bedroom door against her husband reverberated throughout Victorian England.

In the book Helen has left her husband to protect their son from his influence. She supports herself and her son in hiding by painting. She has violated social conventions and English law. Until the Married Women&#x27;s Property Act 1870 was passed, a married woman had no legal existence independent from her husband and could not own property nor sue for divorce nor control the custody of her children. Helen&#x27;s husband had a right to reclaim her and charge her with kidnapping. By subsisting on her own income she was stealing her husband&#x27;s property since this income was legally his.

Anne stated her intentions in the second edition, published in August 1848. She presented a forceful rebuttal to critics (among them Charlotte) who considered her portrayal of Huntingdon overly graphic and disturbing. Anne &quot;wished to tell the truth&quot;. She explained: &quot;When we have to do with vice and vicious characters, I maintain it is better to depict them as they really are than as they would wish to appear.&quot; Anne also castigated reviewers who speculated on the sex of authors and the perceived appropriateness of their writing. She was

==London visit==

In July 1848 Anne and Charlotte went to Charlotte&#x27;s publisher George Smith in London to dispel the rumour that the &quot;Bell brothers&quot; were one person. Emily refused to go. Anne and Charlotte spent several days with Smith. Many years after Anne&#x27;s death, he wrote in &quot;The Cornhill Magazine&quot; his impressions of her:
The increasing popularity of the Bells&#x27; works led to renewed interest in &quot;Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell&quot;, originally published by Aylott and Jones. The remaining print run was bought by Smith and Elder, and reissued under new covers in November 1848. It still sold poorly.

==Family tragedies==
Branwell&#x27;s persistent drunkenness disguised the decline of his health and he died on 24 September 1848. His sudden death shocked the family. He was 31. The cause was recorded as chronic bronchitismarasmus, but was probably tuberculosis.

The family suffered from coughs and colds during the winter of 1848, and Emily became very ill. She worsened over two months and rejected medical aid until the morning of 19 December. She was very weak and said that &quot;if you will send for a doctor, I will see him now&quot;. But Emily died at about two o&#x27;clock that afternoon, aged 30.

Emily&#x27;s death deeply affected Anne. Her grief undermined her physical health. Over Christmas Anne had influenza. Her symptoms intensified and in early January her father sent for a Leeds physician. The doctor diagnosed advanced consumption with little hope of recovery. Anne met the news with characteristic determination and self-control. However, in her letter to Ellen Nussey she expressed her frustrated ambitions:

Unlike Emily, Anne took all the recommended medicines and followed the advice she was given. She also wrote her last poem, &quot;A dreadful darkness closes in&quot;, in which she deals with being terminally ill. Her health fluctuated for months, but she grew thinner and weaker.

==Death==

Anne seemed somewhat better in February. She decided to visit Scarborough to see if the change of location and the fresh sea air might benefit her. Charlotte was initially against the journey, fearing that it would be too stressful, but changed her mind after the doctor&#x27;s approval and Anne&#x27;s assurance that it was her last hope.

On 24 May 1849, Anne set off for Scarborough with Charlotte and Ellen Nussey. They spent a day and night in York en route. Here they escorted Anne in a wheelchair and did some shopping and visited York Minster. It was clear that Anne had little strength left.

On Sunday 27 May, Anne asked Charlotte whether it would be easier to return home and die instead of remaining in Scarborough. A doctor was consulted the next day and said that death was close. Anne received the news quietly. She expressed her love and concern for Ellen and Charlotte, and whispered for Charlotte to &quot;take courage&quot;. Anne died at about two o&#x27;clock in the afternoon on 28 May 1849, aged 29.

Charlotte decided to &quot;lay the flower where it had fallen&quot;. So Anne was buried in Scarborough. The funeral was held on 30 May. Patrick Brontë could not have made the journey if he had wished to. The former schoolmistress at Roe Head, Miss Wooler, was in Scarborough, and she was the only other mourner at Anne&#x27;s funeral. Anne was buried in St Mary&#x27;s churchyard, beneath the castle walls and overlooking the bay. Charlotte commissioned a stone to be placed over her grave with the inscription, When Charlotte visited the grave three years later she discovered multiple errors on the headstone and had it refaced, but it was still not free of error, for Anne was 29 when she died, not 28 as written.

In 2011 the Brontë Society installed a new plaque at Anne Brontë&#x27;s grave. The original gravestone had become illegible at places and could not be restored. It was left undisturbed while the new plaque was laid horizontally, interpreting the fading words of the original and correcting its error. In April 2013 the Brontë Society held a dedication and blessing service at the gravesite to mark the installation of the new plaque.

==Reputation==
After Anne&#x27;s death, Charlotte addressed issues with the first edition of &quot;Agnes Grey&quot; for its republication, but she prevented republication of &quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot;. In 1850, Charlotte wrote that Subsequent critics paid less attention to Anne&#x27;s work and some dismissed her as &quot;a Brontë without genius&quot;.

But since the mid-20th century her life and works have been given better attention. Biographies by Winifred Gérin (1959), Elizabeth Langland (1989) and Edward Chitham (1991), as well as Juliet Barker&#x27;s group biography, &quot;The Brontës&quot; (1994; revised edition 2000), and work by critics such as Inga-Stina Ewbank, Marianne Thormählen, Laura C Berry, Jan B Gordon, Mary Summers, and Juliet McMaster has led to acceptance of Anne Brontë as a major literary figure. Sally McDonald of the Brontë Society said in 2013 that in some ways Anne &quot;is now viewed as the most radical of the sisters, writing about tough subjects such as women&#x27;s need to maintain independence and how alcoholism can tear a family apart.&quot; In 2016 Lucy Mangan championed Anne Brontë in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Being the Brontës&quot;.

<doc id="2030" wikidata="Q8018" url="?curid=2030" title="Augustine of Hippo">
<text>Augustine of Hippo ( , ; ; 13 November 354 – 28 August 430), also known as Saint Augustine and in the Eastern Orthodox Church as Blessed Augustine, was a theologian and philosopher of Berber origin and the bishop of Hippo Regius in Numidia, Roman North Africa. His writings deeply influenced the development of Western philosophy and Western Christianity, and he is viewed as one of the most important Church Fathers of the Latin Church in the Patristic Period. His many important works include &quot;The City of God&quot;, &quot;On Christian Doctrine&quot;, and &quot;Confessions&quot;.

According to his contemporary, Jerome of Stridon, Augustine &quot;established anew the ancient Faith&quot;. In his youth he was drawn to the Manichaean faith, and later to the Hellenistic philosophy of Neoplatonism. After his conversion to Christianity and baptism in 386, Augustine developed his own approach to philosophy and theology, accommodating a variety of methods and perspectives. Believing the grace of Christ was indispensable to human freedom, he helped formulate the doctrine of original sin and made significant contributions to the development of just war theory. When the Western Roman Empire began to disintegrate, Augustine imagined the Church as a spiritual City of God, distinct from the material Earthly City. The segment of the Church that adhered to the concept of the Trinity as defined by the Council of Nicaea and the Council of Constantinople closely identified with Augustine&#x27;s &quot;On the Trinity&quot;.

Augustine is recognized as a saint in the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Lutheran churches, and the Anglican Communion. He is also a preeminent Catholic Doctor of the Church and the patron of the Augustinians. His memorial is celebrated on 28 August, the day of his death. Augustine is the patron saint of brewers, printers, theologians, and a number of cities and dioceses. His thoughts profoundly influenced the medieval worldview. Many Protestants, especially Calvinists and Lutherans, consider him one of the theological fathers of the Protestant Reformation due to his teachings on salvation and divine grace. Protestant Reformers generally, and Martin Luther in particular, held Augustine in preeminence among early Church Fathers. From 1505 to 1521, Luther was a member of the Order of the Augustinian Eremites.

In the East, his teachings are more disputed and were notably attacked by John Romanides, but other theologians and figures of the Eastern Orthodox Church have shown significant approbation of his writings, chiefly Georges Florovsky. The most controversial doctrine associated with him, the filioque, was rejected by the Eastern Orthodox Church. Other disputed teachings include his views on original sin, the doctrine of grace, and predestination. Though considered to be mistaken on some points, he is still considered a saint and has influenced some Eastern Church Fathers, most notably Gregory Palamas. In the Greek and Russian Orthodox Churches, his feast day is celebrated on 15 June.

The historian Diarmaid MacCulloch has written: &quot;Augustine&#x27;s impact on Western Christian thought can hardly be overstated; only his beloved example, Paul of Tarsus, has been more influential, and Westerners have generally seen Paul through Augustine&#x27;s eyes.&quot;

== Life ==
=== Background ===
Augustine of Hippo, also known as &quot;Saint Augustine&quot; or &quot;Saint Austin&quot;, is known by various cognomens throughout the many denominations of the Christian world, including &quot;Blessed Augustine&quot; and the &quot;Doctor of Grace&quot; ().

Hippo Regius, where Augustine was the bishop, was in modern-day Annaba, Algeria.

=== Childhood and education ===

Augustine was born in 354 in the municipium of Thagaste (now Souk Ahras, Algeria) in the Roman province of Numidia. His mother, Monica or Monnica, was a devout Christian; his father Patricius was a pagan who converted to Christianity on his deathbed. He had a brother named Navigius and a sister whose name is lost but is conventionally remembered as Perpetua.

Scholars generally agree that Augustine and his family were Berbers, an ethnic group indigenous to North Africa, but were heavily Romanized, speaking only Latin at home as a matter of pride and dignity. In his writings, Augustine mentions in passing his identity as a Roman African. For example, he refers to Apuleius as &quot;the most notorious of us Africans,&quot; to Ponticianus as &quot;a country man of ours, insofar as being African,&quot; and to Faustus of Mileve as &quot;an African Gentleman&quot;.

Augustine&#x27;s family name, Aurelius, suggests his father&#x27;s ancestors were freedmen of the &quot;gens Aurelia&quot; given full Roman citizenship by the Edict of Caracalla in 212. Augustine&#x27;s family had been Roman, from a legal standpoint, for at least a century when he was born. It is assumed that his mother, Monica, was of Berber origin, on the basis of her name, but as his family were &quot;honestiores&quot;, an upper class of citizens known as honorable men, Augustine&#x27;s first language was likely Latin.

At the age of 11, Augustine was sent to school at Madaurus (now M&#x27;Daourouch), a small Numidian city about south of Thagaste. There he became familiar with Latin literature, as well as pagan beliefs and practices. His first insight into the nature of sin occurred when he and a number of friends stole pears from a neighbourhood garden. He tells this story in his autobiography, &quot;Confessions&quot;. He realises that the pears were &quot;tempting neither for its colour nor its flavour&quot; – he was neither hungry nor poor, and he had enough of fruit which were &quot;much better&quot;. Over the next few chapters, Augustine agonises over this past sin of his, recognising that one does not desire evil for evil&#x27;s sake. Rather, &quot;through an inordinate preference for these goods of a lower kind, the better and higher are neglected&quot;. In other words, man is drawn to sin when grossly choosing the lesser good over a greater good. Eventually, Augustine concludes that it was the good of the &quot;companionship&quot; between him and his accomplices that allowed him to delight in this theft.

At the age of 17, through the generosity of his fellow citizen Romanianus, Augustine went to Carthage to continue his education in rhetoric, though it was above the financial means of his family. Despite the good warnings of his mother, as a youth Augustine lived a hedonistic lifestyle for a time, associating with young men who boasted of their sexual exploits. The need to gain their acceptance encouraged inexperienced boys like Augustine to seek or make up stories about sexual experiences. 

It was while he was a student in Carthage that he read Cicero&#x27;s dialogue &quot;Hortensius&quot; (now lost), which he described as leaving a lasting impression, enkindling in his heart the love of wisdom and a great thirst for truth. It started his interest in philosophy. Although raised Christian, Augustine became a Manichaean, much to his mother&#x27;s chagrin.

At about the age of 17, Augustine began a relationship with a young woman in Carthage. Though his mother wanted him to marry a person of his class, the woman remained his lover. He was warned by his mother to avoid fornication (sex outside marriage), but Augustine persisted in the relationship for over fifteen years, and the woman gave birth to his son Adeodatus (372–388), which means &quot;Gift from God&quot;, who was viewed as extremely intelligent by his contemporaries. In 385, Augustine ended his relationship with his lover in order to prepare to marry a teenage heiress. By the time he was able to marry her, however, he had already converted to Christianity and decided to become a Christian priest and the marriage did not happen.

Augustine was, from the beginning, a brilliant student, with an eager intellectual curiosity, but he never mastered Greek – his first Greek teacher was a brutal man who constantly beat his students, and Augustine rebelled and refused to study. By the time he realized he needed to know Greek, it was too late; and although he acquired a smattering of the language, he was never eloquent with it. He did, however, become a master of Latin.

=== Move to Carthage, Rome, and Milan ===
Augustine taught grammar at Thagaste during 373 and 374. The following year he moved to Carthage to conduct a school of rhetoric and remained there for the next nine years. Disturbed by unruly students in Carthage, he moved to establish a school in Rome, where he believed the best and brightest rhetoricians practised, in 383. However, Augustine was disappointed with the apathetic reception. It was the custom for students to pay their fees to the professor on the last day of the term, and many students attended faithfully all term, and then did not pay.

Manichaean friends introduced him to the prefect of the City of Rome, Symmachus, who had been asked by the imperial court at Milan to provide a rhetoric professor. Augustine won the job and headed north to take his position in Milan in late 384. Thirty years old, he had won the most visible academic position in the Latin world at a time when such posts gave ready access to political careers.

Although Augustine spent ten years as a Manichaean, he was never an initiate or &quot;elect&quot;, but an &quot;auditor&quot;, the lowest level in this religion&#x27;s hierarchy. While still at Carthage a disappointing meeting with the Manichaean bishop, Faustus of Mileve, a key exponent of Manichaean theology, started Augustine&#x27;s scepticism of Manichaeanism. In Rome, he reportedly turned away from Manichaeanism, embracing the scepticism of the New Academy movement. Because of his education, Augustine had great rhetorical prowess and was very knowledgeable of the philosophies behind many faiths. At Milan, his mother&#x27;s religiosity, Augustine&#x27;s own studies in Neoplatonism, and his friend Simplicianus all urged him towards Christianity. This was shortly after the Roman emperor Theodosius I declared Christianity to be the only legitimate religion for the Roman Empire on 27 February 380 by the Edict of Thessalonica and then issued a decree of death for all Manichaean monks in 382. Initially, Augustine was not strongly influenced by Christianity and its ideologies, but after coming in contact with Ambrose of Milan, Augustine reevaluated himself and was forever changed.
Augustine arrived in Milan and visited Ambrose, having heard of his reputation as an orator. Like Augustine, Ambrose was a master of rhetoric, but older and more experienced. Soon, their relationship grew, as Augustine wrote, &quot;And I began to love him, of course, not at the first as a teacher of the truth, for I had entirely despaired of finding that in thy Churchbut as a friendly man.&quot; Augustine was very much influenced by Ambrose, even more than by his own mother and others he admired. In his &quot;Confessions&quot;, Augustine states, &quot;That man of God received me as a father would, and welcomed my coming as a good bishop should.&quot; Ambrose adopted Augustine as a spiritual son after the death of Augustine&#x27;s father.

Augustine&#x27;s mother had followed him to Milan and arranged a respectable marriage for him. Although Augustine acquiesced, he had to dismiss his concubine and grieved for having forsaken his lover. He wrote, &quot;My mistress being torn from my side as an impediment to my marriage, my heart, which clave to her, was racked, and wounded, and bleeding.&quot; Augustine confessed he had not been a lover of wedlock so much as a slave of lust, so he procured another concubine since he had to wait two years until his fiancée came of age. However, his emotional wound was not healed. It was during this period that he uttered his famously insincere prayer, &quot;Grant me chastity and continence, but not yet.&quot;

There is evidence Augustine may have considered this former relationship to be equivalent to marriage. In his &quot;Confessions&quot;, he admitted the experience eventually produced a decreased sensitivity to pain. Augustine eventually broke off his engagement to his eleven-year-old fiancée but never renewed his relationship with either of his concubines. Alypius of Thagaste steered Augustine away from marriage, saying they could not live a life together in the love of wisdom if he married. Augustine looked back years later on the life at Cassiciacum, a villa outside of Milan where he gathered with his followers, and described it as &quot;Christianae vitae otium&quot; – the leisure of Christian life.

=== Conversion to Christianity and priesthood ===
In late August of 386, at the age of 31, having heard of Ponticianus&#x27;s and his friends&#x27; first reading of the life of Anthony of the Desert, Augustine converted to Christianity. As Augustine later told it, his conversion was prompted by hearing a child&#x27;s voice say &quot;take up and read&quot; (). Resorting to the &quot;sortes biblicae&quot;, he opened a book of St. Paul&#x27;s writings (&quot;Confessiones&quot; 8.12.29) at random and read Romans 13:13–14: &quot;Not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying, but put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh to fulfil the lusts thereof.&quot;

He later wrote an account of his conversion in his &quot;Confessions&quot; (), which has since become a classic of Christian theology and a key text in the history of autobiography. This work is an outpouring of thanksgiving and penitence. Although it is written as an account of his life, the &quot;Confessions&quot; also talks about the nature of time, causality, free will, and other important philosophical topics. The following is taken from that work:


Ambrose baptized Augustine and his son Adeodatus, in Milan on Easter Vigil, 24–25 April 387. A year later, in 388, Augustine completed his apology &quot;On the Holiness of the Catholic Church&quot;. That year, also, Adeodatus and Augustine returned home to Africa. Augustine&#x27;s mother Monica died at Ostia, Italy, as they prepared to embark for Africa. Upon their arrival, they began a life of aristocratic leisure at Augustine&#x27;s family&#x27;s property. Soon after, Adeodatus, too, died. Augustine then sold his patrimony and gave the money to the poor. He only kept the family house, which he converted into a monastic foundation for himself and a group of friends. Furthermore, while he was known for his major contributions to Christian rhetoric, another major contribution was his preaching style.

After converting to Christianity, Augustine turned against his profession as a rhetoric professor in order to devote more time to preaching. In 391 Augustine was ordained a priest in Hippo Regius (now Annaba), in Algeria. He was especially interested in discovering how his previous rhetorical training in Italian schools would help the Christian Church achieve its objective of discovering and teaching the different scriptures in the Bible. He became a famous preacher (more than 350 preserved sermons are believed to be authentic), and was noted for combating the Manichaean religion, to which he had formerly adhered. He preached around 6,000 to 10,000 sermons when he was alive; however, there are only around 500 sermons that are accessible today. When Augustine preached his sermons, they were recorded by stenographers. Some of his sermons would last over one hour and he would preach multiple times throughout a given week. When talking to his audience, he would stand on an elevated platform; however, he would walk towards the audience during his sermons. When he was preaching, he used a variety of rhetorical devices that included analogies, word pictures, similes, metaphors, repetition, and antithesis when trying to explain more about the Bible. In addition, he used questions and rhymes when talking about the differences between people&#x27;s life on Earth and Heaven as seen in one of his sermons that was preached in 412 AD. Augustine believed that the preachers&#x27; ultimate goal is to ensure the salvation of their audience.

In 395, he was made coadjutor Bishop of Hippo and became full Bishop shortly thereafter, hence the name &quot;Augustine of Hippo&quot;; and he gave his property to the church of Thagaste. He remained in that position until his death in 430. Bishops were the only individuals allowed to preach when he was alive and he scheduled time to preach after being ordained despite a busy schedule made up of preparing sermons and preaching at other churches besides his own. When serving as the Bishop of Hippo, his goal was to minister to individuals in his congregation and he would choose the passages that the church planned to read every week. As bishop, he believed that it was his job to interpret the work of the Bible. He wrote his autobiographical &quot;Confessions&quot; in 397–398. His work &quot;The City of God&quot; was written to console his fellow Christians shortly after the Visigoths had sacked Rome in 410. Augustine worked tirelessly to convince the people of Hippo to convert to Christianity. Though he had left his monastery, he continued to lead a monastic life in the episcopal residence.

Much of Augustine&#x27;s later life was recorded by his friend Possidius, bishop of Calama (present-day Guelma, Algeria), in his &quot;Sancti Augustini Vita&quot;. During this latter part of Augustine&#x27;s life, he helped lead a large community of Christians against different political and religious factors which had a major influence on his writings. Possidius admired Augustine as a man of powerful intellect and a stirring orator who took every opportunity to defend Christianity against its detractors. Possidius also described Augustine&#x27;s personal traits in detail, drawing a portrait of a man who ate sparingly, worked tirelessly, despised gossip, shunned the temptations of the flesh, and exercised prudence in the financial stewardship of his see.

== Death and sainthood ==
Shortly before Augustine&#x27;s death, the Vandals, a Germanic tribe that had converted to Arianism, invaded Roman Africa. The Vandals besieged Hippo in the spring of 430 when Augustine entered his final illness. According to Possidius, one of the few miracles attributed to Augustine, the healing of an ill man, took place during the siege. Augustine has been cited to have excommunicated himself upon the approach of his death in an act of public penance and solidarity with sinners. Spending his final days in prayer and repentance, he requested the penitential Psalms of David be hung on his walls so he could read them and upon which led him to &quot;[weep] freely and constantly&quot; according to Possidius&#x27; biography. He directed the library of the church in Hippo and all the books therein should be carefully preserved. He died on 28 August 430. Shortly after his death, the Vandals lifted the siege of Hippo, but they returned soon after and burned the city. They destroyed all but Augustine&#x27;s cathedral and library, which they left untouched.

Augustine was canonized by popular acclaim, and later recognized as a Doctor of the Church in 1298 by Pope Boniface VIII. His feast day is 28 August, the day on which he died. He is considered the patron saint of brewers, printers, theologians, and a number of cities and dioceses. He is invoked against sore eyes.

Augustine is remembered in the Church of England&#x27;s calendar of saints with a lesser festival on 28 August.

=== Relics ===

According to Bede&#x27;s &quot;True Martyrology&quot;, Augustine&#x27;s body was later translated or moved to Cagliari, Sardinia, by the Catholic bishops expelled from North Africa by Huneric. Around 720, his remains were transported again by Peter, bishop of Pavia and uncle of the Lombard king Liutprand, to the church of San Pietro in Ciel d&#x27;Oro in Pavia, to save them from frequent coastal raids by Saracens. In January 1327, Pope John XXII issued the papal bull &quot;Veneranda Santorum Patrum&quot;, in which he appointed the Augustinians guardians of the tomb of Augustine (called &quot;Arca&quot;), which was remade in 1362 and elaborately carved with bas-reliefs of scenes from Augustine&#x27;s life, created by Giovanni di Balduccio.

In October 1695, some workmen in the Church of San Pietro in Ciel d&#x27;Oro in Pavia discovered a marble box containing human bones (including part of a skull). A dispute arose between the Augustinian hermits (Order of Saint Augustine) and the regular canons (Canons Regular of Saint Augustine) as to whether these were the bones of Augustine. The hermits did not believe so; the canons affirmed they were. Eventually Pope Benedict XIII (1724–1730) directed the Bishop of Pavia, Monsignor Pertusati, to make a determination. The bishop declared that, in his opinion, the bones were those of Augustine.

The Augustinians were expelled from Pavia in 1785, Augustine&#x27;s ark and relics were brought to Pavia Cathedral in 1799. San Pietro fell into disrepair but was finally restored in the 1870s, under the urging of Agostino Gaetano Riboldi, and reconsecrated in 1896 when the relics of Augustine and the shrine were once again reinstalled.

In 1842, a portion of Augustine&#x27;s right arm (cubitus) was secured from Pavia and returned to Annaba. It now rests in the Saint Augustin Basilica within a glass tube inserted into the arm of a life-size marble statue of the saint.

== Views and thought ==

Augustine&#x27;s large contribution of writings covered diverse fields including theology, philosophy and sociology. Along with John Chrysostom, Augustine was among the most prolific scholars of the early church by quantity.

=== Theology ===
==== Christian anthropology ====
Augustine was one of the first Christian ancient Latin authors with a very clear vision of theological anthropology. He saw the human being as a perfect unity of soul and body. In his late treatise &quot;&quot; (420) he exhorted respect for the body on the grounds it belonged to the very nature of the human person. Augustine&#x27;s favourite figure to describe &quot;body-soul&quot; unity is marriage: &quot;caro tua, coniunx tua – your body is your wife&quot;.

Initially, the two elements were in perfect harmony. After the fall of humanity they are now experiencing dramatic combat with one another. They are two categorically different things. The body is a three-dimensional object composed of the four elements, whereas the soul has no spatial dimensions. Soul is a kind of substance, participating in reason, fit for ruling the body.

Augustine was not preoccupied, as Plato and Descartes were, in detailed efforts to explain the metaphysics of the soul-body union. It sufficed for him to admit they are metaphysically distinct: to be a human is to be a composite of soul and body, with the soul superior to the body. The latter statement is grounded in his hierarchical classification of things into those that merely exist, those that exist and live, and those that exist, live, and have intelligence or reason.

Like other Church Fathers such as Athenagoras, Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria and Basil of Caesarea, Augustine &quot;vigorously condemned the practice of induced abortion&quot;, and although he disapproved of abortion during any stage of pregnancy, he made a distinction between early and later abortions. He acknowledged the distinction between &quot;formed&quot; and &quot;unformed&quot; fetuses mentioned in the Septuagint translation of Exodus 21:22–23, which incorrectly translates the word &quot;harm&quot; (from the original Hebrew text) as &quot;form&quot; in the Koine Greek of the Septuagint. His view was based on the Aristotelian distinction &quot;between the fetus before and after its supposed &#x27;vivification. Therefore, he did not classify as murder the abortion of an &quot;unformed&quot; fetus since he thought it could not be known with certainty the fetus had received a soul.

Augustine held that &quot;the timing of the infusion of the soul was a mystery known to God alone&quot;. However, he considered procreation as &quot;one of the goods of marriage; abortion figured as a means, along with drugs which cause sterility, of frustrating this good. It lay along a continuum which included infanticide as an instance of &#x27;lustful cruelty&#x27; or &#x27;cruel lust.&#x27; Augustine called the use of means to avoid the birth of a child an &#x27;evil work:&#x27; a reference to either abortion or contraception or both.&quot;

==== Creation ====

In &quot;City of God&quot;, Augustine rejected both the contemporary ideas of ages (such as those of certain Greeks and Egyptians) that differed from the Church&#x27;s sacred writings. In &quot;The Literal Interpretation of Genesis&quot;, Augustine argued that God had created everything in the universe simultaneously and not over a period of six days. He argued the six-day structure of creation presented in the Book of Genesis represents a logical framework, rather than the passage of time in a physical way – it would bear a spiritual, rather than physical, meaning, which is no less literal. One reason for this interpretation is the passage in Sirach 18:1, &quot;creavit omnia simul&quot; (&quot;He created all things at once&quot;), which Augustine took as proof that the days of Genesis 1 had to be taken non-literalistically. As additional support for describing the six days of creation as a heuristic device, Augustine thought the actual event of creation would be incomprehensible by humans and therefore needed to be translated.

Augustine also does not envision original sin as causing structural changes in the universe, and even suggests that the bodies of Adam and Eve were already created mortal before the Fall. Apart from his specific views, Augustine recognized that interpreting the creation story was difficult, and remarked that interpretations could change should new information come up.

==== Ecclesiology ====
Augustine developed his doctrine of the Church principally in reaction to the Donatist sect. He taught there is one Church, but within this Church there are two realities, namely, the visible aspect (the institutional hierarchy, the Catholic sacraments, and the laity) and the invisible (the souls of those in the Church, who are either dead, sinful members or elect predestined for Heaven). The former is the institutional body established by Christ on earth which proclaims salvation and administers the sacraments, while the latter is the invisible body of the elect, made up of genuine believers from all ages, who are known only to God. The Church, which is visible and societal, will be made up of &quot;wheat&quot; and &quot;tares&quot;, that is, good and wicked people (as per Mat. 13:30), until the end of time. This concept countered the Donatist claim that only those in a state of grace were the &quot;true&quot; or &quot;pure&quot; church on earth, and that priests and bishops who were not in a state of grace had no authority or ability to confect the sacraments.

Augustine&#x27;s ecclesiology was more fully developed in &quot;City of God&quot;. There he conceives of the church as a heavenly city or kingdom, ruled by love, which will ultimately triumph over all earthly empires which are self-indulgent and ruled by pride. Augustine followed Cyprian in teaching that bishops and priests of the Church are the successors of the Apostles, and their authority in the Church is God-given.

The concept of Church invisible was advocated by Augustine as part of his refutation of the Donatist sect, though he, as other Church Fathers before him, saw the invisible Church and visible Church as one and the same thing, unlike the later Protestant reformers who did not identify the Catholic Church as the true church. He was strongly influenced by the Platonist belief that true reality is invisible and that, if the visible reflects the invisible, it does so only partially and imperfectly (see Theory of Forms). Others question whether Augustine really held to some form of an &quot;invisible true Church&quot; concept.

==== Eschatology ====
Augustine originally believed in premillennialism, namely that Christ would establish a literal 1,000-year kingdom prior to the general resurrection, but later rejected the belief, viewing it as carnal. During the medieval period, the Catholic Church built its system of eschatology on Augustinian amillennialism, where Christ rules the earth spiritually through his triumphant church.

During the Reformation, theologians such as John Calvin accepted amillennialism. Augustine taught that the eternal fate of the soul is determined at death, and that purgatorial fires of the intermediate state purify only those who died in communion with the Church. His teaching provided fuel for later theology.

==== Mariology ====
Although Augustine did not develop an independent Mariology, his statements on Mary surpass in number and depth those of other early writers. Even before the Council of Ephesus, he defended the Ever-Virgin Mary as the Mother of God, believing her to be &quot;full of grace&quot; (following earlier Latin writers such as Jerome) on account of her sexual integrity and innocence. Likewise, he affirmed that the Virgin Mary &quot;conceived as virgin, gave birth as virgin and stayed virgin forever&quot;.

==== Natural knowledge and biblical interpretation ====
Augustine took the view that, if a literal interpretation contradicts science and humans&#x27; God-given reason, the biblical text should be interpreted metaphorically. While each passage of Scripture has a literal sense, this &quot;literal sense&quot; does not always mean the Scriptures are mere history; at times they are rather an extended metaphor.

==== Original sin ====

Augustine taught that the sin of Adam and Eve was either an act of foolishness (&quot;insipientia&quot;) followed by pride and disobedience to God or that pride came first. The first couple disobeyed God, who had told them not to eat of the Tree of the knowledge of good and evil (Gen 2:17). The tree was a symbol of the order of creation. Self-centeredness made Adam and Eve eat of it, thus failing to acknowledge and respect the world as it was created by God, with its hierarchy of beings and values.

They would not have fallen into pride and lack of wisdom if Satan had not sown into their senses &quot;the root of evil&quot; (&quot;radix Mali&quot;). Their nature was wounded by concupiscence or libido, which affected human intelligence and will, as well as affections and desires, including sexual desire. In terms of metaphysics, concupiscence is not a state of being but a bad quality, the privation of good or a wound.

Augustine&#x27;s understanding of the consequences of original sin and the necessity of redeeming grace was developed in the struggle against Pelagius and his Pelagian disciples, Caelestius and Julian of Eclanum, who had been inspired by Rufinus of Syria, a disciple of Theodore of Mopsuestia. They refused to agree original sin wounded human will and mind, insisting human nature was given the power to act, to speak, and to think when God created it. Human nature cannot lose its moral capacity for doing good, but a person is free to act or not act in a righteous way. Pelagius gave an example of eyes: they have capacity for seeing, but a person can make either good or bad use of it.

Pelagians insisted human affections and desires were not touched by the fall either. Immorality, e.g. fornication, is exclusively a matter of will, i.e. a person does not use natural desires in a proper way. In opposition, Augustine pointed out the apparent disobedience of the flesh to the spirit, and explained it as one of the results of original sin, punishment of Adam and Eve&#x27;s disobedience to God.

Augustine had served as a &quot;Hearer&quot; for the Manichaeans for about nine years, who taught that the original sin was carnal knowledge. But his struggle to understand the cause of evil in the world started before that, at the age of nineteen. By &quot;malum&quot; (evil) he understood most of all concupiscence, which he interpreted as a vice dominating people and causing in men and women moral disorder. Agostino Trapè insists Augustine&#x27;s personal experience cannot be credited for his doctrine about concupiscence. He considers Augustine&#x27;s marital experience to be quite normal, and even exemplary, aside from the absence of Christian wedding rites. As J. Brachtendorf showed, Augustine used Ciceronian Stoic concept of passions, to interpret Paul&#x27;s doctrine of universal sin and redemption.
The view that not only human soul but also senses were influenced by the fall of Adam and Eve was prevalent in Augustine&#x27;s time among the Fathers of the Church. It is clear the reason for Augustine&#x27;s distancing from the affairs of the flesh was different from that of Plotinus, a Neoplatonist who taught that only through disdain for fleshly desire could one reach the ultimate state of mankind. Augustine taught the redemption, i.e. transformation and purification, of the body in the resurrection.

Some authors perceive Augustine&#x27;s doctrine as directed against human sexuality and attribute his insistence on continence and devotion to God as coming from his need to reject his own highly sensual nature as described in the &quot;Confessions&quot;. Augustine taught that human sexuality has been wounded, together with the whole of human nature, and requires redemption of Christ. That healing is a process realized in conjugal acts. The virtue of continence is achieved thanks to the grace of the sacrament of Christian marriage, which becomes therefore a &quot;remedium concupiscentiae&quot; – remedy of concupiscence. The redemption of human sexuality will be, however, fully accomplished only in the resurrection of the body.

The sin of Adam is inherited by all human beings. Already in his pre-Pelagian writings, Augustine taught that Original Sin is transmitted to his descendants by concupiscence, which he regarded as the passion of both soul and body, making humanity a &quot;massa damnata&quot; (mass of perdition, condemned crowd) and much enfeebling, though not destroying, the freedom of the will. Although earlier Christian authors taught the elements of physical death, moral weakness, and a sin propensity within original sin, Augustine was the first to add the concept of inherited guilt (&quot;reatus&quot;) from Adam whereby an infant was eternally damned at birth.

Although Augustine&#x27;s anti-Pelagian defence of original sin was confirmed at numerous councils, i.e. Carthage (418), Ephesus (431), Orange (529), Trent (1546) and by popes, i.e. Pope Innocent I (401–417) and Pope Zosimus (417–418), his inherited guilt eternally damning infants was omitted by these councils and popes. Anselm of Canterbury established in his &quot;Cur Deus Homo&quot; the definition that was followed by the great 13th-century Schoolmen, namely that Original Sin is the &quot;privation of the righteousness which every man ought to possess,&quot; thus separating it from &quot;concupiscence,&quot; with which some of Augustine&#x27;s disciples had identified it, as later did Luther and Calvin. In 1567, Pope Pius V condemned the identification of Original Sin with concupiscence.

==== Predestination ====
Augustine taught that God orders all things while preserving human freedom. Prior to 396, he believed predestination was based on God&#x27;s foreknowledge of whether individuals would believe in Christ, that God&#x27;s grace was &quot;a reward for human assent&quot;. Later, in response to Pelagius, Augustine said that the sin of pride consists in assuming &quot;we are the ones who choose God or that God chooses us (in his foreknowledge) because of something worthy in us&quot;, and argued that God&#x27;s grace causes the individual act of faith.

Scholars are divided over whether Augustine&#x27;s teaching implies double predestination, or the belief God chooses some people for damnation as well as some for salvation. Catholic scholars tend to deny he held such a view while some Protestants and secular scholars have held that Augustine did believe in double predestination. About 412, Augustine became the first Christian to understand predestination as a divine unilateral pre-determination of individuals&#x27; eternal destinies independently of human choice, although his prior Manichaean sect did teach this concept. Some Protestant theologians, such as Justo L. González and Bengt Hägglund, interpret Augustine&#x27;s teaching that grace is irresistible, results in conversion, and leads to perseverance.

In &quot;On Rebuke and Grace&quot; (&quot;De correptione et gratia&quot;), Augustine wrote: &quot;And what is written, that He wills all men to be saved, while yet all men are not saved, may be understood in many ways, some of which I have mentioned in other writings of mine; but here I will say one thing: He wills all men to be saved, is so said that all the predestinated may be understood by it, because every kind of men is among them.&quot;

Speaking of the twins Jacob and Esau, Augustine wrote in his book &quot;On the Gift of Perseverance&quot;, &quot;[I]t ought to be a most certain fact that the former is of the predestinated, the latter is not.&quot;

==== Sacramental theology ====
Also in reaction to the Donatists, Augustine developed a distinction between the &quot;regularity&quot; and &quot;validity&quot; of the sacraments. Regular sacraments are performed by clergy of the Catholic Church, while sacraments performed by schismatics are considered irregular. Nevertheless, the validity of the sacraments does not depend upon the holiness of the priests who perform them (&quot;ex opere operato&quot;); therefore, irregular sacraments are still accepted as valid provided they are done in the name of Christ and in the manner prescribed by the Church. On this point, Augustine departs from the earlier teaching of Cyprian, who taught that converts from schismatic movements must be re-baptised. Augustine taught that sacraments administered outside the Catholic Church, though true sacraments, avail nothing. However, he also stated that baptism, while it does not confer any grace when done outside the Church, does confer grace as soon as one is received into the Catholic Church.

Augustine believed that in a real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, saying that Christ&#x27;s statement, &quot;This is my body&quot; referred to the bread he carried in his hands, and that Christians must have faith the bread and wine are in fact the body and blood of Christ, despite what they see with their eyes. For instance, he stated that &quot;He [Jesus] walked here in the same flesh, and gave us the same flesh to be eaten unto salvation. But no one eats that flesh unless first he adores it; and thus it is discovered how such a footstool of the Lord&#x27;s feet is adored; and not only do we not sin by adoring, we do sin by not adoring.&quot;

Presbyterian professor and author John Riggs argued that Augustine held that Christ is really present in the elements of the Eucharist, but not in a bodily manner, because his body remains in Heaven.

Augustine, in his work &quot;On Christian Doctrine&quot;, referred to the Eucharist as a &quot;figure&quot; and a &quot;sign&quot;.

Against the Pelagians, Augustine strongly stressed the importance of infant baptism. About the question whether baptism is an absolute necessity for salvation, however, Augustine appears to have refined his beliefs during his lifetime, causing some confusion among later theologians about his position. He said in one of his sermons that only the baptized are saved. This belief was shared by many early Christians. However, a passage from his &quot;City of God&quot;, concerning the Apocalypse, may indicate Augustine did believe in an exception for children born to Christian parents.

=== Philosophy ===
==== Astrology ====
Augustine&#x27;s contemporaries often believed astrology to be an exact and genuine science. Its practitioners were regarded as true men of learning and called &quot;mathematici&quot;. Astrology played a prominent part in Manichaean doctrine, and Augustine himself was attracted by their books in his youth, being particularly fascinated by those who claimed to foretell the future. Later, as a bishop, he warned that one should avoid astrologers who combine science and horoscopes. (Augustine&#x27;s term &quot;mathematici&quot;, meaning &quot;astrologers&quot;, is sometimes mistranslated as &quot;mathematicians&quot;.) According to Augustine, they were not genuine students of Hipparchus or Eratosthenes but &quot;common swindlers&quot;.

==== Epistemology ====
Epistemological concerns shaped Augustine&#x27;s intellectual development. His early dialogues &quot;Contra academicos&quot; (386) and &quot;De Magistro&quot; (389), both written shortly after his conversion to Christianity, reflect his engagement with sceptical arguments and show the development of his doctrine of divine illumination. The doctrine of illumination claims God plays an active and regular part in human perception and understanding by illuminating the mind so human beings can recognize intelligible realities God presents (as opposed to God designing the human mind to be reliable consistently, as in, for example, Descartes&#x27;s idea of clear and distinct perceptions). According to Augustine, illumination is obtainable to all rational minds and is different from other forms of sense perception. It is meant to be an explanation of the conditions required for the mind to have a connection with intelligible entities.

Augustine also posed the problem of other minds throughout different works, most famously perhaps in &quot;On the Trinity&quot; (VIII.6.9), and developed what has come to be a standard solution: the argument from analogy to other minds. In contrast to Plato and other earlier philosophers, Augustine recognized the centrality of testimony to human knowledge and argued that what others tell us can provide knowledge even if we do not have independent reasons to believe their testimonial reports.

==== Just war ====

Augustine asserted Christians should be pacifists as a personal, philosophical stance. However, peacefulness in the face of a grave wrong that could only be stopped by violence would be a sin. Defence of one&#x27;s self or others could be a necessity, especially when authorized by a legitimate authority. While not breaking down the conditions necessary for war to be just, Augustine coined the phrase in his work &quot;The City of God&quot;. In essence, the pursuit of peace must include the option of fighting for its long-term preservation. Such a war could not be pre-emptive, but defensive, to restore peace. Thomas Aquinas, centuries later, used the authority of Augustine&#x27;s arguments in an attempt to define the conditions under which a war could be just.

==== Free will ====
Included in Augustine&#x27;s earlier theodicy is the claim God created humans and angels as rational beings possessing free will. Free will was not intended for sin, meaning it is not equally predisposed to both good and evil. A will defiled by sin is not considered as &quot;free&quot; as it once was because it is bound by material things, which could be lost or be difficult to part with, resulting in unhappiness. Sin impairs free will, while grace restores it. Only a will that was once free can be subjected to sin&#x27;s corruption. After 412, Augustine changed his theology, teaching that humanity had no free will to believe in Christ but only a free will to sin: &quot;I in fact strove on behalf of the free choice of the human &#x27;will,&#x27; but God&#x27;s grace conquered&quot; (&quot;Retract&quot;. 2.1).

The early Christians opposed the deterministic views (e.g., fate) of Stoics, Gnostics, and Manichaeans prevalent in the first four centuries. Christians championed the concept of a relational God who interacts with humans rather than a Stoic or Gnostic God who unilaterally foreordained every event (yet Stoics still claimed to teach free will). Patristics scholar Ken Wilson argues that every early Christian author with extant writings who wrote on the topic prior to Augustine of Hippo (412) advanced human free choice rather than a deterministic God. According to Wilson, Augustine taught traditional free choice until 412, when he reverted to his earlier Manichaean and Stoic deterministic training when battling the Pelagians. Only a few Christians accepted Augustine&#x27;s view of free will until the Protestant Reformation when both Luther and Calvin embraced Augustine&#x27;s deterministic teachings wholeheartedly.

The Catholic Church considers Augustine&#x27;s teaching to be consistent with free will. He often said that anyone can be saved if they wish. While God knows who will and will not be saved, with no possibility for the latter to be saved in their lives, this knowledge represents God&#x27;s perfect knowledge of how humans will freely choose their destinies.

=== Sociology, morals and ethics ===
==== Natural law ====
Augustine was among the earliest to examine the legitimacy of the laws of man, and attempt to define the boundaries of what laws and rights occur naturally, instead of being arbitrarily imposed by mortals. All who have wisdom and conscience, he concludes, are able to use reason to recognize the &quot;lex naturalis&quot;, natural law. Mortal law should not attempt to force people to do what is right or avoid what is wrong, but simply to remain just. Therefore &quot;an unjust law is no law at all&quot;. People are not obligated to obey laws that are unjust, those that their conscience and reason tell them violate natural law and rights.

==== Slavery ====
Augustine led many clergy under his authority at Hippo to free their slaves as a &quot;pious and holy&quot; act. He boldly wrote a letter urging the emperor to set up a new law against slave traders and was very much concerned about the sale of children. Christian emperors of his time for 25 years had permitted the sale of children, not because they approved of the practice, but as a way of preventing infanticide when parents were unable to care for a child. Augustine noted that the tenant farmers in particular were driven to hire out or to sell their children as a means of survival.

In his book, &quot;The City of God&quot;, he presents the development of slavery as a product of sin and as contrary to God&#x27;s divine plan. He wrote that God &quot;did not intend that this rational creature, who was made in his image, should have dominion over anything but the irrational creation – not man over man, but man over the beasts&quot;. Thus he wrote that righteous men in primitive times were made shepherds of cattle, not kings over men. &quot;The condition of slavery is the result of sin&quot;, he declared. In &quot;The City of God&quot;, Augustine wrote he felt the existence of slavery was a punishment for the existence of sin, even if an individual enslaved person committed no sin meriting punishment. He wrote: &quot;Slavery is, however, penal, and is appointed by that law which enjoins the preservation of the natural order and forbids its disturbance.&quot; Augustine believed slavery did more harm to the slave owner than the enslaved person himself: &quot;the lowly position does as much good to the servant as the proud position does harm to the master.&quot; Augustine proposes as a solution to sin a type of cognitive reimagining of one&#x27;s situation, where slaves &quot;may themselves make their slavery in some sort free, by serving not in crafty fear, but in faithful love,&quot; until the end of the world eradicated slavery for good: &quot;until all unrighteousness pass away, and all principality and every human power be brought to nothing, and God be all in all.&quot;

==== Jews ====
Against certain Christian movements, some of which rejected the use of Hebrew Scripture, Augustine countered that God had chosen the Jews as a special people, and he considered the scattering of Jewish people by the Roman Empire to be a fulfilment of prophecy. He rejected homicidal attitudes, quoting part of the same prophecy, namely &quot;Slay them not, lest they should at last forget Thy law&quot; (Psalm 59:11). Augustine, who believed Jewish people would be converted to Christianity at &quot;the end of time&quot;, argued God had allowed them to survive their dispersion as a warning to Christians; as such, he argued, they should be permitted to dwell in Christian lands.

The sentiment sometimes attributed to Augustine that Christians should let the Jews &quot;survive but not thrive&quot; (it is repeated by the author James Carroll in his book &quot;Constantine&#x27;s Sword&quot;, for example) is apocryphal and is not found in any of his writings.

==== Sexuality and the sexes ====
For Augustine, the evil of sexual immorality was not in the sexual act itself, but in the emotions that typically accompany it. In &quot;On Christian Doctrine&quot; Augustine contrasts love, which is enjoyment on account of God, and lust, which is not on account of God. Augustine claims that, following the Fall, sexual lust (&quot;concupiscentia&quot;) has become necessary for copulation (as required to stimulate male erection), sexual lust is an evil result of the Fall, and therefore, evil must inevitably accompany sexual intercourse (&quot;On marriage and concupiscence&quot; 1.19). Therefore, following the Fall, even marital sex carried out merely to procreate inevitably perpetuates evil (&quot;On marriage and concupiscence&quot; 1.27; &quot;A Treatise against Two Letters of the Pelagians&quot; 2.27). For Augustine, proper love exercises a denial of selfish pleasure and the subjugation of corporeal desire to God. The only way to avoid evil caused by sexual intercourse is to take the &quot;better&quot; way (&quot;Confessions&quot; 8.2) and abstain from marriage (&quot;On marriage and concupiscence&quot; 1.31). Sex within marriage is not, however, for Augustine a sin, although necessarily produces the evil of sexual lust. Based on the same logic, Augustine also declared the pious virgins raped during the sack of Rome to be innocent because they did not intend to sin nor enjoy the act.

Before the Fall, Augustine believed sex was a passionless affair, &quot;just like many a laborious work accomplished by the compliant operation of our other limbs, without any lascivious heat&quot;, that the seed &quot;might be sown without any shameful lust, the genital members simply obeying the inclination of the will&quot;. After the Fall, by contrast, the penis cannot be controlled by mere will, subject instead to both unwanted impotence and involuntary erections: &quot;Sometimes the urge arises unwanted; sometimes, on the other hand, it forsakes the eager lover, and desire grows cold in the body while burning in the mind... It arouses the mind, but it does not follow through what it has begun and arouse the body also&quot; (&quot;City of God&quot; 14.16).

Augustine censured those who try to prevent the creation of offspring when engaging in sexual relations, saying that though they may be nominally married they are not really, but are using that designation as a cloak for turpitude. When they allow their unwanted children to die of exposure, they unmask their sin. Sometimes they use drugs to produce sterility, or other means to try to destroy the fetus before they are born. Their marriage is not wedlock but debauchery.

Augustine believed Adam and Eve had both already chosen in their hearts to disobey God&#x27;s command not to eat of the Tree of Knowledge before Eve took the fruit, ate it, and gave it to Adam. Accordingly, Augustine did not believe Adam was any less guilty of sin. Augustine praises women and their role in society and in the Church. In his &quot;Tractates on the Gospel of John&quot;, Augustine, commenting on the Samaritan woman from John 4:1–42, uses the woman as a figure of the Church in agreement with the New Testament teaching that the Church is the bride of Christ. &quot;Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.&quot;

Augustine believed that &quot;woman has been made for man&quot; and that &quot;in sex she is physically subject to him in the same way as our natural impulses need to be subjected to the reasoning power of the mind, in order that the actions to which they lead may be inspired by the principles of good conduct&quot;. Women were created as a &quot;helper&quot; to men for Augustine.

==== Pedagogy ====

Augustine is considered an influential figure in the history of education. A work early in Augustine&#x27;s writings is &quot;De Magistro&quot; (On the Teacher), which contains insights into education. His ideas changed as he found better directions or better ways of expressing his ideas. In the last years of his life, Augustine wrote his &quot;Retractationes&quot; (&quot;Retractations&quot;), reviewing his writings and improving specific texts. Henry Chadwick believes an accurate translation of &quot;retractationes&quot; may be &quot;reconsiderations&quot;. Reconsiderations can be seen as an overarching theme of the way Augustine learned. Augustine&#x27;s understanding of the search for understanding, meaning, and truth as a restless journey leaves room for doubt, development, and change.

Augustine was a strong advocate of critical thinking skills. Because written works were limited during this time, spoken communication of knowledge was very important. His emphasis on the importance of community as a means of learning distinguishes his pedagogy from some others. Augustine believed dialectic is the best means for learning and that this method should serve as a model for learning encounters between teachers and students. Augustine&#x27;s dialogue writings model the need for lively interactive dialogue among learners.
He recommended adapting educational practices to fit the students&#x27; educational backgrounds:
* the student who has been well-educated by knowledgeable teachers;
* the student who has had no education; and
* the student who has had a poor education, but believes himself to be well-educated.

If a student has been well educated in a wide variety of subjects, the teacher must be careful not to repeat what they have already learned, but to challenge the student with material they do not yet know thoroughly. With the student who has had no education, the teacher must be patient, willing to repeat things until the student understands, and sympathetic. Perhaps the most difficult student, however, is the one with an inferior education who believes he understands something when he does not. Augustine stressed the importance of showing this type of student the difference between &quot;having words and having understanding&quot; and of helping the student to remain humble with his acquisition of knowledge.

Under the influence of Bede, Alcuin, and Rabanus Maurus, &quot;De catechizandis rudibus&quot; came to exercise an important role in the education of clergy at the monastic schools, especially from the eighth century onwards.

Augustine believed students should be given an opportunity to apply learned theories to practical experience. Yet another of Augustine&#x27;s major contributions to education is his study on the styles of teaching. He claimed there are two basic styles a teacher uses when speaking to the students. The &quot;mixed style&quot; includes complex and sometimes showy language to help students see the beautiful artistry of the subject they are studying. The &quot;grand style&quot; is not quite as elegant as the mixed style, but is exciting and heartfelt, with the purpose of igniting the same passion in the students&#x27; hearts. Augustine balanced his teaching philosophy with the traditional Bible-based practice of strict discipline.

Augustine knew Latin and Ancient Greek. He had a long correspondence with St Jerome regarding the textual differences existing between the Hebrew Bible and the Greek Septuagint, concluding that the original Greek manuscripts were closely similar to the other Hebrew ones, and also that even the differences in the two original versions of the Holy Scripture could enlight its spiritual meaning to have been unitarily inspired by God.

==== Coercion ====
Augustine of Hippo had to deal with issues of violence and coercion throughout his entire career due largely to the Donatist-Catholic conflict. He is one of the very few authors in Antiquity who ever truly theoretically examined the ideas of religious freedom and coercion. Augustine handled the infliction of punishment and the exercise of power over law-breakers by analyzing these issues in ways similar to modern debates on penal reform.

His teaching on coercion has &quot;embarrassed his modern defenders and vexed his modern detractors,&quot; because it is seen as making him appear &quot;to generations of religious liberals as &quot;le prince et patriarche de persecuteurs.&quot;&quot; Yet Brown asserts that, at the same time, Augustine becomes &quot;an eloquent advocate of the ideal of corrective punishment&quot; and reformation of the wrongdoer. Russell says Augustine&#x27;s theory of coercion &quot;was not crafted from dogma, but in response to a unique historical situation&quot; and is, therefore, context-dependent, while others see it as inconsistent with his other teachings.

===== The context =====
During the Great Persecution, &quot;When Roman soldiers came calling, some of the [Catholic] officials handed over the sacred books, vessels, and other church goods rather than risk legal penalties&quot; over a few objects. Maureen Tilley says this was a problem by 305, that became a schism by 311, because many of the North African Christians had a long established tradition of a &quot;physicalist approach to religion.&quot; The sacred scriptures were not simply books to them, but were the Word of God in physical form, therefore they saw handing over the Bible, and handing over a person to be martyred, as &quot;two sides of the same coin.&quot; Those who cooperated with the authorities became known as &quot;traditores.&quot; The term originally meant &quot;one who hands over a physical object&quot;, but it came to mean &quot;traitor&quot;.

According to Tilley, after the persecution ended, those who had apostatized wanted to return to their positions in the church. The North African Christians, (the rigorists who became known as Donatists), refused to accept them. Catholics were more tolerant and wanted to wipe the slate clean. For the next 75 years, both parties existed, often directly alongside each other, with a double line of bishops for the same cities. Competition for the loyalty of the people included multiple new churches and violence. No one is exactly sure when the Circumcellions and the Donatists allied, but for decades, they fomented protests and street violence, accosted travellers and attacked random Catholics without warning, often doing serious and unprovoked bodily harm such as beating people with clubs, cutting off their hands and feet, and gouging out eyes.

Augustine became coadjutor Bishop of Hippo in 395, and since he believed that conversion must be voluntary, his appeals to the Donatists were verbal. For several years, he used popular propaganda, debate, personal appeal, General Councils, appeals to the emperor and political pressure to bring the Donatists back into union with the Catholics, but all attempts failed. The harsh realities Augustine faced can be found in his Letter 28 written to bishop Novatus around 416. Donatists had attacked, cut out the tongue and cut off the hands of a Bishop Rogatus who had recently converted to Catholicism. An unnamed count of Africa had sent his agent with Rogatus, and he too had been attacked; the count was &quot;inclined to pursue the matter.&quot; Russell says Augustine demonstrates a &quot;hands-on&quot; involvement with the details of his bishopric, but at one point in the letter, he confesses he does not know what to do. &quot;All the issues that plague him are there: stubborn Donatists, Circumcellion violence, the vacillating role of secular officials, the imperative to persuade, and his own trepidations.&quot; The empire responded to the civil unrest with the law and its enforcement, and thereafter, Augustine changed his mind about using verbal arguments alone. Instead, he came to support the state&#x27;s use of coercion. Augustine did not believe the empire&#x27;s enforcement would &quot;make the Donatists more virtuous&quot; but he did believe it would make them &quot;less vicious.&quot;

===== The theology =====
The primary &#x27;proof-text&#x27; of what Augustine thought concerning coercion is from Letter 93, written in 408, as a reply to bishop Vincentius, of Cartenna (Mauretania, North Africa). This letter shows that both practical and biblical reasons led Augustine to defend the legitimacy of coercion. He confesses that he changed his mind because of &quot;the ineffectiveness of dialogue and the proven efficacy of laws.&quot; He had been worried about false conversions if force was used, but &quot;now,&quot; he says, &quot;it seems imperial persecution is working.&quot; Many Donatists had converted. &quot;Fear had made them reflect, and made them docile.&quot; Augustine continued to assert that coercion could not directly convert someone, but concluded it could make a person ready to be reasoned with.

According to Mar Marcos, Augustine made use of several biblical examples to legitimize coercion, but the primary analogy in Letter 93 and in Letter 185, is the parable of the Great Feast in Luke 14.15–24 and its statement &quot;compel them to come in.&quot; Russell says, Augustine uses the Latin term &quot;cogo&quot;, instead of the &quot;compello&quot; of the Vulgate, since to Augustine, &quot;cogo&quot; meant to &quot;gather together&quot; or &quot;collect&quot; and was not simply &quot;compel by physical force.&quot;

In 1970, Robert Markus argued that, for Augustine, a degree of external pressure being brought for the purpose of reform was compatible with the exercise of free will. Russell asserts that &quot;Confessions 13&quot; is crucial to understanding Augustine&#x27;s thought on coercion; using Peter Brown&#x27;s explanation of Augustine&#x27;s view of salvation, he explains that Augustine&#x27;s past, his own sufferings and &quot;conversion through God&#x27;s pressures,&quot; along with his biblical hermeneutics, is what led him to see the value in suffering for discerning truth. According to Russell, Augustine saw coercion as one among many conversion strategies for forming &quot;a pathway to the inner person.&quot;

In Augustine&#x27;s view, there is such a thing as just and unjust persecution. Augustine explains that when the purpose of persecution is to lovingly correct and instruct, then it becomes discipline and is just. He said the church would discipline its people out of a loving desire to heal them, and that, &quot;once compelled to come in, heretics would gradually give their voluntary assent to the truth of Christian orthodoxy.&quot; Frederick H. Russell describes this as &quot;a pastoral strategy in which the church did the persecuting with the dutiful assistance of Roman authorities,&quot; adding that it is &quot;a precariously balanced blend of external discipline and inward nurturance.&quot;

Augustine placed limits on the use of coercion, recommending fines, imprisonment, banishment, and moderate floggings, preferring beatings with rods which was a common practice in the ecclesial courts. He opposed severity, maiming, and the execution of heretics. While these limits were mostly ignored by Roman authorities, Michael Lamb says that in doing this, &quot;Augustine appropriates republican principles from his Roman predecessors...&quot; and maintains his commitment to liberty, legitimate authority, and the rule of law as a constraint on arbitrary power. He continues to advocate holding authority accountable to prevent domination but affirms the state&#x27;s right to act.

Herbert A. Deane, on the other hand, says there is a fundamental inconsistency between Augustine&#x27;s political thought and &quot;his final position of approval of the use of political and legal weapons to punish religious dissidence&quot; and others have seconded this view. Brown asserts that Augustine&#x27;s thinking on coercion is more of an attitude than a doctrine since it is &quot;not in a state of rest,&quot; but is instead marked by &quot;a painful and protracted attempt to embrace and resolve tensions.&quot;

According to Russell, it is possible to see how Augustine himself had evolved from his earlier &quot;Confessions&quot; to this teaching on coercion and the latter&#x27;s strong patriarchal nature: &quot;Intellectually, the burden has shifted imperceptibly from discovering the truth to disseminating the truth.&quot; The bishops had become the church&#x27;s elite with their own rationale for acting as &quot;stewards of the truth.&quot; Russell points out that Augustine&#x27;s views are limited to time and place and his own community, but later, others took what he said and applied it outside those parameters in ways Augustine never imagined or intended.

== Works ==
Augustine was one of the most prolific Latin authors in terms of surviving works, and the list of his works consists of more than one hundred separate titles. They include apologetic works against the heresies of the Arians, Donatists, Manichaeans and Pelagians; texts on Christian doctrine, notably (&quot;On Christian Doctrine&quot;); exegetical works such as commentaries on Genesis, the Psalms and Paul&#x27;s Letter to the Romans; many sermons and letters; and the &quot;Retractationes&quot;, a review of his earlier works which he wrote near the end of his life.

Apart from those, Augustine is probably best known for his &quot;Confessions&quot;, which is a personal account of his earlier life, and for &quot;De civitate Dei&quot; (&quot;The City of God&quot;, consisting of 22 books), which he wrote to restore the confidence of his fellow Christians, which was badly shaken by the sack of Rome by the Visigoths in 410. His &quot;On the Trinity&quot;, in which he developed what has become known as the &#x27;psychological analogy&#x27; of the Trinity, is also considered to be among his masterpieces, and arguably of more doctrinal importance than the &quot;Confessions&quot; or the &quot;City of God&quot;. He also wrote &quot;On Free Choice of the Will&quot; (&quot;De libero arbitrio&quot;), addressing why God gives humans free will that can be used for evil.

== Legacy ==
In both his philosophical and theological reasoning, Augustine was greatly influenced by Stoicism, Platonism and Neoplatonism, particularly by the work of Plotinus, author of the &quot;Enneads&quot;, probably through the mediation of Porphyry and Victorinus (as Pierre Hadot has argued). Some Neoplatonic concepts are still visible in Augustine&#x27;s early writings. His early and influential writing on the human will, a central topic in ethics, would become a focus for later philosophers such as Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche. He was also influenced by the works of Virgil (known for his teaching on language), and Cicero (known for his teaching on argument). Augustine, along with Ambrose, Jerome and pope Gregory the Great, is considered one of the four Great Latin Church Fathers.

=== In philosophy ===
Philosopher Bertrand Russell was impressed by Augustine&#x27;s meditation on the nature of time in the &quot;Confessions&quot;, comparing it favourably to Kant&#x27;s version of the view that time is subjective. Catholic theologians generally subscribe to Augustine&#x27;s belief that God exists outside of time in the &quot;eternal present&quot;; that time only exists within the created universe because only in space is time discernible through motion and change. His meditations on the nature of time are closely linked to his consideration of the human ability of memory. Frances Yates in her 1966 study &quot;The Art of Memory&quot; argues that a brief passage of the &quot;Confessions&quot;, 10.8.12, in which Augustine writes of walking up a flight of stairs and entering the vast fields of memory clearly indicates that the ancient Romans were aware of how to use explicit spatial and architectural metaphors as a mnemonic technique for organizing large amounts of information.

Augustine&#x27;s philosophical method, especially demonstrated in his &quot;Confessions&quot;, had a continuing influence on Continental philosophy throughout the 20th century. His descriptive approach to intentionality, memory, and language as these phenomena are experienced within consciousness and time anticipated and inspired the insights of modern phenomenology and hermeneutics. Edmund Husserl writes: &quot;The analysis of time-consciousness is an age-old crux of descriptive psychology and theory of knowledge. The first thinker to be deeply sensitive to the immense difficulties to be found here was Augustine, who laboured almost to despair over this problem.&quot;

Martin Heidegger refers to Augustine&#x27;s descriptive philosophy at several junctures in his influential work &quot;Being and Time&quot;. Hannah Arendt began her philosophical writing with a dissertation on Augustine&#x27;s concept of love, &quot;Der Liebesbegriff bei Augustin&quot; (1929): &quot;The young Arendt attempted to show that the philosophical basis for &quot;vita socialis&quot; in Augustine can be understood as residing in neighbourly love, grounded in his understanding of the common origin of humanity.&quot;

Jean Bethke Elshtain in &quot;Augustine and the Limits of Politics&quot; tried to associate Augustine with Arendt in their concept of evil: &quot;Augustine did not see evil as glamorously demonic but rather as absence of good, something which paradoxically is really nothing. Arendt ... envisioned even the extreme evil which produced the Holocaust as merely banal [in &quot;Eichmann in Jerusalem&quot;].&quot; Augustine&#x27;s philosophical legacy continues to influence contemporary critical theory through the contributions and inheritors of these 20th-century figures. Seen from a historical perspective, there are three main perspectives on the political thought of Augustine: first, political Augustinianism; second, Augustinian political theology; and third, Augustinian political theory.

=== In theology ===

Thomas Aquinas was influenced heavily by Augustine. On the topic of original sin, Aquinas proposed a more optimistic view of man than that of Augustine in that his conception leaves to the reason, will, and passions of fallen man their natural powers even after the Fall, without &quot;supernatural gifts&quot;. While in his pre-Pelagian writings Augustine taught that Adam&#x27;s guilt as transmitted to his descendants much enfeebles, though does not destroy, the freedom of their will, Protestant reformers Martin Luther and John Calvin affirmed that Original Sin completely destroyed liberty (see total depravity).

According to Leo Ruickbie, Augustine&#x27;s arguments against magic, differentiating it from a miracle, were crucial in the early Church&#x27;s fight against paganism and became a central thesis in the later denunciation of witches and witchcraft. According to Professor Deepak Lal, Augustine&#x27;s vision of the heavenly city has influenced the secular projects and traditions of the Enlightenment, Marxism, Freudianism and eco-fundamentalism. Post-Marxist philosophers Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt rely heavily on Augustine&#x27;s thoughts, particularly &quot;The City of God&quot;, in their book of political philosophy &quot;Empire&quot;.

Augustine has influenced many modern-day theologians and authors such as John Piper. Hannah Arendt, an influential 20th-century political theorist, wrote her doctoral dissertation in philosophy on Augustine, and continued to rely on his thought throughout her career. Ludwig Wittgenstein extensively quotes Augustine in &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot; for his approach to language, both admiringly, and as a sparring partner to develop his own ideas, including an extensive opening passage from the &quot;Confessions&quot;. Contemporary linguists have argued that Augustine has significantly influenced the thought of Ferdinand de Saussure, who did not &#x27;invent&#x27; the modern discipline of semiotics, but rather built upon Aristotelian and Neoplatonic knowledge from the Middle Ages, via an Augustinian connection: &quot;as for the constitution of Saussurian semiotic theory, the importance of the Augustinian thought contribution (correlated to the Stoic one) has also been recognized. Saussure did not do anything but reform an ancient theory in Europe, according to the modern conceptual exigencies.&quot;

Pope Francis suggests that Augustine&#x27;s reflections on the relationship between the &quot;beloved disciple&quot; and Jesus (John 13:23: &quot;reclining next to him&quot;) contributed to the development of devotion to the Sacred Heart in the following centuries. In his autobiographical book &quot;Milestones&quot;, Pope Benedict XVI notes that Augustine was one of the deepest influences in his thought.

=== Oratorio, music ===
Marc-Antoine Charpentier, Motet &quot;Pour St Augustin mourant&quot;, H.419, for 2 voices and continuo (1687), and &quot;Pour St Augustin&quot;, H.307, for 2 voices and continuo (1670s).

Much of Augustine&#x27;s conversion is dramatized in the oratorio &quot;La conversione di Sant&#x27;Agostino&quot; (1750) composed by Johann Adolph Hasse. The libretto for this oratorio, written by Duchess Maria Antonia of Bavaria, draws upon the influence of Metastasio (the finished libretto having been edited by him) and is based on an earlier five-act play &quot;Idea perfectae conversionis dive Augustinus&quot; written by the Jesuit priest Franz Neumayr. In the libretto Augustine&#x27;s mother Monica is presented as a prominent character that is worried that Augustine might not convert to Christianity. As Dr. Andrea Palent says: Throughout the oratorio Augustine shows his willingness to turn to God, but the burden of the act of conversion weighs heavily on him. This is displayed by Hasse through extended recitative passages.

=== In popular art ===

In his poem &quot;Confessional&quot;, Frank Bidart compares the relationship between Augustine and his mother, Saint Monica, to the relationship between the poem&#x27;s speaker and his mother.

In the 2010 TV miniseries &quot;Restless Heart: The Confessions of Saint Augustine&quot;, Augustine is played by Matteo Urzia (aged 15), Alessandro Preziosi (aged 25) and Franco Nero (aged 76).

In 1967, American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan released a song entitled &quot;I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine&quot; as part of his album &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot;. The song has been covered by several artists including Joan Baez, Vic Chesnutt, Eric Clapton, John Doe, Thea Gilmore, Adam Selzer and Dirty Projectors.

In 2016, the band The Chairman Dances released &quot;Augustine&quot;, a response song to Bob Dylan’s &quot;I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine&quot;. In it, Augustine says he&#x27;s not sure why Dylan dreams about him.

English pop/rock musician, singer and songwriter Sting wrote a song related to Saint Augustine entitled &quot;Saint Augustine in Hell&quot; which was part of his fourth solo studio album &quot;Ten Summoner&#x27;s Tales&quot; released in March 1993.

<doc id="2032" wikidata="Q222749" url="?curid=2032" title="Acting">
<text>Acting is an activity in which a story is told by means of its enactment by an actor who adopts a character—in theatre, television, film, radio, or any other medium that makes use of the mimetic mode.

Acting involves a broad range of skills, including a well-developed imagination, emotional facility, physical expressivity, vocal projection, clarity of speech, and the ability to interpret drama. Acting also demands an ability to employ dialects, accents, improvisation, observation and emulation, mime, and stage combat. Many actors train at length in specialist programs or colleges to develop these skills. The vast majority of professional actors have gone through extensive training. Actors and actresses will often have many instructors and teachers for a full range of training involving singing, scene-work, audition techniques, and acting for camera.

Most early sources in the West that examine the art of acting (, &quot;hypokrisis&quot;) discuss it as part of rhetoric.

== History ==
One of the first known actors was an ancient Greek called Thespis of Icaria in Athens. Writing two centuries after the event, Aristotle in his &quot;Poetics&quot; () suggests that Thespis stepped out of the dithyrambic chorus and addressed it as a separate character. Before Thespis, the chorus narrated (for example, &quot;Dionysus did this, Dionysus said&quot;). When Thespis stepped out from the chorus, he spoke as if he were the character (for example, &quot;I am Dionysus, I did this&quot;). To distinguish between these different modes of storytelling—enactment and narration—Aristotle uses the terms &quot;mimesis&quot; (via enactment) and &quot;diegesis&quot; (via narration). From the Greek actor Thespis&#x27; name derives the word &quot;thespian&quot;.

==Training==
Conservatories and drama schools typically offer two- to four-year training on all aspects of acting. Universities mostly offer three- to four-year programs, in which a student is often able to choose to focus on acting, whilst continuing to learn about other aspects of theatre. Schools vary in their approach, but in North America the most popular method taught derives from the &#x27;system&#x27; of Konstantin Stanislavski, which was developed and popularised in America as method acting by Lee Strasberg, Stella Adler, Sanford Meisner, and others.

Other approaches may include a more physically based orientation, such as that promoted by theatre practitioners as diverse as Anne Bogart, Jacques Lecoq, Jerzy Grotowski, or Vsevolod Meyerhold. Classes may also include psychotechnique, mask work, physical theatre, improvisation, and acting for camera.

Regardless of a school&#x27;s approach, students should expect intensive training in textual interpretation, voice, and movement. Applications to drama programmes and conservatories usually involve extensive auditions. Anybody over the age of 18 can usually apply. Training may also start at a very young age. Acting classes and professional schools targeted at under-18s are widespread. These classes introduce young actors to different aspects of acting and theatre, including scene study.

Increased training and exposure to public speaking allows people to maintain a calmer and more relaxed physiology. Measuring a public speaker&#x27;s heart rate is perhaps one of the easiest ways to assess changes in stress, as heart rate increases with anxiety. As actors increase their performances, heart rate and other signs of stress may decrease. This is very important in training actors, as adaptive strategies gained from increased exposure to public speaking can regulate implicit and explicit anxiety. By attending an institution that specializes in acting, the increased opportunity to act will lead to a more relaxed physiology and a decrease in stress and its effects on the body. These effects can range from hormonal to cognitive health that can impact quality of life and performance.

==Improvisation==
Some classical forms of acting involve a substantial element of improvised performance. Most notable is its use by the troupes of the &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot;, a form of masked comedy that originated in Italy.

Improvisation as an approach to acting formed an important part of the Russian theatre practitioner Konstantin Stanislavski&#x27;s &#x27;system&#x27; of actor training, which he developed from the 1910s onwards. Late in 1910, the playwright Maxim Gorky invited Stanislavski to join him in Capri, where they discussed training and Stanislavski&#x27;s emerging &quot;grammar&quot; of acting. Inspired by a popular theatre performance in Naples that utilised the techniques of the &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot;, Gorky suggested that they form a company, modelled on the medieval strolling players, in which a playwright and group of young actors would devise new plays together by means of improvisation. Stanislavski would develop this use of improvisation in his work with his First Studio of the Moscow Art Theatre. Stanislavski&#x27;s use was extended further in the approaches to acting developed by his students, Michael Chekhov and Maria Knebel.

In the United Kingdom, the use of improvisation was pioneered by Joan Littlewood from the 1930s onwards and, later, by Keith Johnstone and Clive Barker. In the United States, it was promoted by Viola Spolin, after working with Neva Boyd at a Hull House in Chicago, Illinois (Spolin was Boyd&#x27;s student from 1924 to 1927). Like the British practitioners, Spolin felt that playing games was a useful means of training actors and helped to improve an actor&#x27;s performance. With improvisation, she argued, people may find expressive freedom, since they do not know how an improvised situation will turn out. Improvisation demands an open mind in order to maintain spontaneity, rather than pre-planning a response. A character is created by the actor, often without reference to a dramatic text, and a drama is developed out of the spontaneous interactions with other actors. This approach to creating new drama has been developed most substantially by the British filmmaker Mike Leigh, in films such as &quot;Secrets &amp; Lies&quot; (1996), &quot;Vera Drake&quot; (2004), &quot;Another Year&quot; (2010), and &quot;Mr. Turner&quot; (2014).

Improvisation is also used to cover up if an actor or actress makes a mistake.

==Physiological effects==
Acting in front of an audience many times can cause &quot;stage fright&quot;, a form of stress in which someone becomes anxious in front of an audience. This is common among actors, especially new actors, and can cause symptoms such as increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, and sweating.

In a 2017 study on American university students, actors of various experience levels all showed similarly elevated heart rates throughout their performances; this agrees with previous studies on professional and amateur actors&#x27; heart rates. While all actors experienced stress, causing elevated heart rate, the more experienced actors displayed less heart rate variability than the less experienced actors in the same play. The more experienced actors experienced less stress while performing, and therefore had a smaller degree of variability than the less experienced, more stressed actors. The more experienced an actor is, the more stable their heart rate will be while performing, but will still experience elevated heart rates.

==Semiotics==

The semiotics of acting involves a study of the ways in which aspects of a performance come to operate for its audience as signs. This process largely involves the production of meaning, whereby elements of an actor&#x27;s performance acquire significance, both within the broader context of the dramatic action and in the relations each establishes with the real world.

Following the ideas proposed by the Surrealist theorist Antonin Artaud, however, it may also be possible to understand communication with an audience that occurs &#x27;beneath&#x27; significance and meaning (which the semiotician Félix Guattari described as a process involving the transmission of &quot;a-signifying signs&quot;). In his &quot;The Theatre and its Double&quot; (1938), Artaud compared this interaction to the way in which a snake charmer communicates with a snake, a process which he identified as &quot;mimesis&quot;—the same term that Aristotle in his &quot;Poetics&quot; () used to describe the mode in which drama communicates its story, by virtue of its embodiment by the actor enacting it, as distinct from &quot;diegesis&quot;, or the way in which a narrator may describe it. These &quot;vibrations&quot; passing from the actor to the audience may not necessarily precipitate into significant elements as such (that is, consciously perceived &quot;meanings&quot;), but rather may operate by means of the circulation of &quot;affects&quot;.

The approach to acting adopted by other theatre practitioners involve varying degrees of concern with the semiotics of acting. Konstantin Stanislavski, for example, addresses the ways in which an actor, building on what he calls the &quot;experiencing&quot; of a role, should also shape and adjust a performance in order to support the overall significance of the drama—a process that he calls establishing the &quot;perspective of the role&quot;. The semiotics of acting plays a far more central role in Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s epic theatre, in which an actor is concerned to bring out clearly the socio historical significance of behaviour and action by means of specific performance choices—a process that he describes as establishing the &quot;not/but&quot; element in a performed physical &quot;&quot;gestus&quot; within context of the play&#x27;s overall &quot;Fabel&quot;&quot;. Eugenio Barba argues that actors ought not to concern themselves with the significance of their performance behaviour; this aspect is the responsibility, he claims, of the director, who weaves the signifying elements of an actor&#x27;s performance into the director&#x27;s dramaturgical &quot;montage&quot;.

The theatre semiotician Patrice Pavis, alluding to the contrast between Stanislavski&#x27;s &#x27;system&#x27; and Brecht&#x27;s demonstrating performer—and, beyond that, to Denis Diderot&#x27;s foundational essay on the art of acting, &quot;Paradox of the Actor&quot; (–78)—argues that:
Elements of a semiotics of acting include the actor&#x27;s gestures, facial expressions, intonation and other vocal qualities, rhythm, and the ways in which these aspects of an individual performance relate to the drama and the theatrical event (or film, television programme, or radio broadcast, each of which involves different semiotic systems) considered as a whole. A semiotics of acting recognises that all forms of acting involve conventions and codes by means of which performance behaviour acquires significance—including those approaches, such as Stanislvaski&#x27;s or the closely related method acting developed in the United States, that offer themselves as &quot;a natural kind of acting that can do without conventions and be received as self-evident and universal.&quot; Pavis goes on to argue that:

The conventions that govern acting in general are related to structured forms of play, which involve, in each specific experience, &quot;rules of the game.&quot; This aspect was first explored by Johan Huizinga (in &quot;Homo Ludens&quot;, 1938) and Roger Caillois (in &quot;Man, Play and Games&quot;, 1958). Caillois, for example, distinguishes four aspects of play relevant to acting: &quot;mimesis&quot; (simulation), &quot;agon&quot; (conflict or competition), &quot;alea&quot; (chance), and &quot;ilinx&quot; (vertigo, or &quot;vertiginous psychological situations&quot; involving the spectator&#x27;s identification or catharsis). This connection with play as an activity was first proposed by Aristotle in his &quot;Poetics&quot;, in which he defines the desire to imitate in play as an essential part of being human and our first means of learning as children:

This connection with play also informed the words used in English (as was the analogous case in many other European languages) for drama: the word &quot;play&quot; or &quot;game&quot; (translating the Anglo-Saxon &quot;plèga&quot; or Latin &quot;ludus&quot;) was the standard term used until William Shakespeare&#x27;s time for a dramatic entertainment—just as its creator was a &quot;play-maker&quot; rather than a &quot;dramatist&quot;, the person acting was known as a &quot;player&quot;, and, when in the Elizabethan era specific buildings for acting were built, they were known as &quot;play-houses&quot; rather than &quot;theatres.&quot;

== Resumes and auditions ==
Actors and actresses need to make a resume when applying for roles. The acting resume is very different from a normal resume; it is generally shorter, with lists instead of paragraphs, and it should have a head shot on the back. Sometimes, a resume also contains a short 30-second to 1-minute reel displaying the actor&#x27;s abilities, so that the casting director can see previous performances, if any. An actor&#x27;s resume should list projects they have acted in before, such as plays, movies, or shows, as well as special skills and their contact information.

Auditioning is the act of performing either a monologue or sides (lines for one character) as sent by the casting director. Auditioning entails showing the actor&#x27;s skills to present themselves as a different person; it may be as brief as two minutes. For theater auditions it can be longer than two minutes, or they may perform more than one monologue, as each casting director can have different requirements for actors. Actors should go to auditions dressed for the part, to make it easier for the casting director to visualize them as the character. For television or film they will have to undergo more than one audition. Oftentimes actors are called into another audition at the last minute, and are sent the sides either that morning or the night before. Auditioning can be a stressful part of acting, especially if one has not been trained to audition.

== Rehearsal ==
Rehearsal is a process in which actors prepare and practice a performance together with directors and technical staff. Some actors continue to rehearse a scene throughout the run of a show in order to keep the scene fresh in their minds and exciting for the audience.

== Audience ==
A critical audience with evaluative spectators is known to induce stress on actors during performance. While public performances cause extremely high stress levels in actors (more so amateur ones), the stress actually improves the performance, supporting the idea of &quot;positive stress in challenging situations.&quot;

== Heart rate ==
Depending on what an actor is doing, their heart rate will vary. This is the body&#x27;s way of responding to stress. Prior to a show, one will see an increase in heart rate due to anxiety. While performing an actor has an increased sense of exposure which will increase performance anxiety and the associated physiological arousal, such as heart rate. Heart rates increases more during shows compared to rehearsals because of the increased pressure, which is because a performance has a potentially greater impact on an actor&#x27;s career. After the show a decrease in the heart rate due to the conclusion of the stress inducing activity can be seen. Often the heart rate will return to normal after the show or performance is done; however, during the applause after the performance there is a rapid spike in heart rate. This can be seen not only in actors but also with public speaking and musicians.

=== Stress ===

There is a correlation between heart-rate and stress when actors&#x27; are performing in front of an audience. Actors claim that having an audience has no change in their stress level, but as soon as they come on stage their heart-rate rises quickly before they speak their first lines. A 2017 study measuring actors&#x27; heart-rate during performance showed that individual heart-rates rose right before the performance began. Length of monologues, experience levels, and actions done on stage were important factors in the study. Heart-rate drops significantly at the end of a monologue, big action scene, or performance.

Acting has been shown to be an effective tool for reducing stress created by social anxiety.

<doc id="2037" wikidata="Q193235" url="?curid=2037" title="Delian League">
<text>The Delian League was a confederacy of Greek city-states, numbering between 150 and 330, founded in 478 BC under the leadership (hegemony) of Athens, whose purpose was to continue fighting the Persian Empire after the Greek victory in the Battle of Plataea at the end of the Second Persian invasion of Greece. The League functioned as a dual –offensive and defensive– alliance (&quot;symmachia&quot;) of autonomous states, similar to its rival association, the Peloponnesian League. The League&#x27;s modern name derives from its official meeting place, the island of Delos, where congresses were held within the sanctuary of the Temple of Apollo; contemporary authors referred to the organization simply as &quot;the Athenians and their Allies&quot;.

While Sparta excelled as Greece&#x27;s greatest power on land, Athens turned to the seas becoming the dominant naval power of the Greek world. Following Sparta&#x27;s withdrawal from the conflict with Persia, Athens took the lead of the Hellenic alliance accompanied by several states around the Aegean and the Anatolian coast. The Delian League was formed as an anti-Persian defensive association of equal city-states seeking protection under Athens, as the latter wished to extend its support towards the Ionian Greek colonies of Anatolia. By the mid-fifth century BC, the alliance had developed into a naval imperial power, called the Athenian Empire, where Athens established complete dominion and the allies became increasingly less autonomous. The alliance held an assembly of representatives in order to shape its policy, while the members swore an oath of loyalty to the coalition. The Delian League successfully accomplished its principal strategic goal by decisively expelling the remaining Persian forces from the Aegean. As a result, Persia would cease to pose a major threat to Greece for the following fifty years.

From its inception, Athens became the League&#x27;s biggest source of military power, while more and more allies preferred to pay the dues in cash. Athens began to use the League&#x27;s funds for its own purposes, like the reinforcement of its naval supremacy, which led to conflicts between the city and its less powerful allies, at times culminating in rebellions, like that of Thasos in 465 BC. The League&#x27;s treasury initially stood in Delos until, in a symbolic gesture, Pericles moved it to Athens in 454 BC. By 431 BC, the threat that the League presented to Spartan hegemony combined with Athens&#x27;s heavy-handed control of the Delian League prompted the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War; the League was dissolved upon the war&#x27;s conclusion in 404 BC under the direction of Lysander, the Spartan commander. Witnessing Sparta&#x27;s growing hegemony in the first half of the 4th century BC, Athens went on to partly revive the alliance, this time called the Second Athenian League, reestablishing its naval dominance in the eastern Mediterranean.

==Background==
The Greco-Persian Wars had their roots in the conquest of the Greek cities of Asia Minor, and particularly Ionia, by the Achaemenid Persian Empire of Cyrus the Great shortly after 550 BC. The Persians found the Ionians difficult to rule, eventually settling for sponsoring a tyrant in each Ionian city. While Greek states had in the past often been ruled by tyrants, this form of government was on the decline. By 500 BC, Ionia appears to have been ripe for rebellion against these Persian clients. The simmering tension finally broke into open revolt due to the actions of the tyrant of Miletus, Aristagoras. Attempting to save himself after a disastrous Persian-sponsored expedition in 499 BC, Aristagoras chose to declare Miletus a democracy. This triggered similar revolutions across Ionia, extending to Doris and Aeolis, beginning the Ionian Revolt.
The Greek states of Athens and Eretria allowed themselves to be drawn into this conflict by Aristagoras, and during their only campaigning season (498 BC) they contributed to the capture and burning of the Persian regional capital of Sardis. After this, the Ionian revolt carried on (without further outside aid) for a further five years, until it was finally completely crushed by the Persians. However, in a decision of great historic significance, the Persian king Darius the Great decided that, despite having subdued the revolt, there remained the unfinished business of exacting punishment on Athens and Eretria for supporting the revolt. The Ionian revolt had severely threatened the stability of Darius&#x27;s empire, and the states of mainland Greece would continue to threaten that stability unless dealt with. Darius thus began to contemplate the complete conquest of Greece, beginning with the destruction of Athens and Eretria.

In the next two decades, there would be two Persian invasions of Greece, occasioning, thanks to Greek historians, some of the most famous battles in history. During the first invasion, Thrace, Macedon and the Aegean Islands were added to the Persian Empire, and Eretria was duly destroyed. However, the invasion ended in 490 BC with the decisive Athenian victory at the Battle of Marathon. After this invasion, Darius died, and responsibility for the war passed to his son Xerxes I.

Xerxes then personally led a second Persian invasion of Greece in 480 BC, taking an enormous (although oft-exaggerated) army and navy to Greece. Those Greeks who chose to resist (the &#x27;Allies&#x27;) were defeated in the twin simultaneous battles of Thermopylae on land and Artemisium at sea. All of Greece except the Peloponnesus thus having fallen into Persian hands, the Persians then seeking to destroy the Allied navy once and for all, suffered a decisive defeat at the Battle of Salamis. The following year, 479 BC, the Allies assembled the largest Greek army yet seen and defeated the Persian invasion force at the Battle of Plataea, ending the invasion and the threat to Greece.

The Allied fleet defeated the remnants of the Persian fleet in the Battle of Mycale near the island of Samos—on the same day as Plataea, according to tradition. This action marks the end of the Persian invasion, and the beginning of the next phase in the Greco-Persian wars, the Greek counterattack. After Mycale, the Greek cities of Asia Minor again revolted, with the Persians now powerless to stop them. The Allied fleet then sailed to the Thracian Chersonese, still held by the Persians, and besieged and captured the town of Sestos. The following year, 478 BC, the Allies sent a force to capture the city of Byzantion (modern day Istanbul). The siege was successful, but the behaviour of the Spartan general Pausanias alienated many of the Allies, and resulted in Pausanias&#x27;s recall.

==Formation==

After Byzantion, Sparta was eager to end its involvement in the war. The Spartans greatly feared the rise of the Athenians as a challenge to their power. Additionally, the Spartans were of the view that, with the liberation of mainland Greece, and the Greek cities of Asia Minor, the war&#x27;s purpose had already been achieved. There was also perhaps a feeling that establishing long-term security for the Asian Greeks would prove impossible. In the aftermath of Mycale, the Spartan king Leotychidas had proposed transplanting all the Greeks from Asia Minor to Europe as the only method of permanently freeing them from Persian dominion.

Xanthippus, the Athenian commander at Mycale, had furiously rejected this; the Ionian cities had been Athenian colonies, and the Athenians, if no one else, would protect the Ionians. This marked the point at which the leadership of the Greek alliance effectively passed to the Athenians. With the Spartan withdrawal after Byzantion, the leadership of the Athenians became explicit.

The loose alliance of city states which had fought against Xerxes&#x27;s invasion had been dominated by Sparta and the Peloponnesian league. With the withdrawal of these states, a congress was called on the holy island of Delos to institute a new alliance to continue the fight against the Persians; hence the modern designation &quot;Delian League&quot;. According to Thucydides, the official aim of the League was to &quot;avenge the wrongs they suffered by ravaging the territory of the king.&quot;

In reality, this goal was divided into three main efforts—to prepare for future invasion, to seek revenge against Persia, and to organize a means of dividing spoils of war. The members were given a choice of either offering armed forces or paying a tax to the joint treasury; most states chose the tax. League members swore to have the same friends and enemies, and dropped ingots of iron into the sea to symbolize the permanence of their alliance. The Athenian politician Aristides would spend the rest of his life occupied in the affairs of the alliance, dying (according to Plutarch) a few years later in Pontus, whilst determining what the tax of new members was to be.

==Members==

The Delian League, also known as the Athenian Empire, was a collection of Greek city-states largely based around the Aegean Sea which operated under the hegemony of Athens. This alliance initially served the purpose of coordinating a united Greek front against a perceived looming Persian threat against the Ionian city-states which bordered it. The members of the Delian League were made to swear an oath of loyalty to the league and contributed mostly monetarily but in some instances donated ships or other forces. It was also the case that many democratic members of the League owed their freedom from oligarchic or tyrannical rule to Athens. Because of this, Athens gained an overwhelming advantage in the voting system conducted by relying on the support of democratic city-states Athens had helped into being. By 454 Athens moved the treasury of the Delian League from the Island of Delos to the Parthenon in Athens. Benefitting greatly from the influx of cash coming out of the 150-330 members, Athens used the money to reinforce its own naval supremacy and used the remaining funds to embellish the city with art and architecture. In order to maintain the new synoecism, Athens began using its greatly expanded military to enforce membership in the League. City-states who wished to leave the alliance were punished by Athens with force such as Mytilene and Melos. No longer considered her allies, Athens eventually began to refer to the members of the Delian League as &quot;all the cities Athens rules.&quot; Athens also extended its authority over members of the League through judicial decisions. Synoecism under the Athenian Empire was enforced by resolving matters of and between states in Athens by courts composed of Athenian citizens and enforcing those decisions through the Athenian military.

==Composition and expansion==
In the first ten years of the league&#x27;s existence, Cimon/Kimon forced Karystos in Euboea to join the league, conquered the island of Skyros and sent Athenian colonists there.

Over time, especially with the suppression of rebellions, Athens exercised hegemony over the rest of the league. Thucydides describes how Athens&#x27;s control over the League grew:
 Of all the causes of defection, that connected with arrears of tribute and vessels, and with failure of service, was the chief; for the Athenians were very severe and exacting, and made themselves offensive by applying the screw of necessity to men who were not used to and in fact not disposed for any continuous labor. In some other respects the Athenians were not the old popular rulers they had been at first; and if they had more than their fair share of service, it was correspondingly easy for them to reduce any that tried to leave the confederacy. The Athenians also arranged for the other members of the league to pay its share of the expense in money instead of in ships and men, and for this the subject city-states had themselves to blame, their wish to get out of giving service making most leave their homes. Thus while Athens was increasing her navy with the funds they contributed, a revolt always found itself without enough resources or experienced leaders for war.

==Rebellion==

===Naxos===
The first member of the league to attempt to secede was the island of Naxos in c. 471 BC. After being defeated, Naxos is believed (based on similar, later revolts) to have been forced to tear down its walls along with losing its fleet and vote in the League.

===Thasos===
In 465 BC, Athens founded the colony of Amphipolis on the Strymon river. Thasos, a member of the League, saw her interests in the mines of Mt. Pangaion threatened and defected from the League to Persia. She called to Sparta for assistance but was denied, as Sparta was facing the largest helot revolt in its history.

After more than two years of siege, Thasos surrendered to the Athenian leader Aristides and was forced back into the league. As a result, the fortification walls of Thasos were torn down, and they had to pay yearly tribute and fines. Additionally, their land, naval ships, and the mines of Thasos were confiscated by Athens. The siege of Thasos marks the transformation of the Delian league from an alliance into, in the words of Thucydides, a hegemony.

==Policies of the League==
In 461 BC, Cimon was ostracized and was succeeded in his influence by democrats such as Ephialtes and Pericles. This signaled a complete change in Athenian foreign policy, neglecting the alliance with the Spartans and instead allying with her enemies, Argos and Thessaly. Megara deserted the Spartan-led Peloponnesian League and allied herself with Athens, allowing construction of a double line of walls across the Isthmus of Corinth and protecting Athens from attack from that quarter. Roughly a decade earlier, due to encouragement from influential speaker Themistocles, the Athenians had also constructed the Long Walls connecting their city to the Piraeus, its port, making it effectively invulnerable to attack by land.

In 454 BC, the Athenian general Pericles moved the Delian League&#x27;s treasury from Delos to Athens, allegedly to keep it safe from Persia. However, Plutarch indicates that many of Pericles&#x27;s rivals viewed the transfer to Athens as usurping monetary resources to fund elaborate building projects. Athens also switched from accepting ships, men and weapons as dues from league members, to only accepting money.

The new treasury established in Athens was used for many purposes, not all relating to the defence of members of the league. It was from tribute paid to the league that Pericles set to building the Parthenon on the Acropolis, replacing an older temple, as well as many other non-defense related expenditures. The Delian League was turning from an alliance into an empire.

==Wars against Persia==
War with the Persians continued. In 460 BC, Egypt revolted under local leaders the Hellenes called Inaros and Amyrtaeus, who requested aid from Athens. Pericles led 250 ships, intended to attack Cyprus, to their aid because it would further damage Persia. After four years, however, the Egyptian rebellion was defeated by the Achaemenid general Megabyzus, who captured the greater part of the Athenian forces. In fact, according to Isocrates, the Athenians and their allies lost some 20,000 men in the expedition, while modern estimates place the figure at 50,000 men and 250 ships including reinforcements. The remainder escaped to Cyrene and thence returned home.

This was the Athenians&#x27; main (public) reason for moving the treasury of the League from Delos to Athens, further consolidating their control over the League. The Persians followed up their victory by sending a fleet to re-establish their control over Cyprus, and 200 ships were sent out to counter them under Cimon, who returned from ostracism in 451 BC. He died during the blockade of Citium, though the fleet won a double victory by land and sea over the Persians off Salamis, Cyprus.

This battle was the last major one fought against the Persians. Many writers report that a peace treaty, known as the Peace of Callias, was formalized in 450 BC, but some writers believe that the treaty was a myth created later to inflate the stature of Athens. However, an understanding was definitely reached, enabling the Athenians to focus their attention on events in Greece proper.

==Wars in Greece==

Soon, war with the Peloponnesians broke out. In 458 BC, the Athenians blockaded the island of Aegina, and simultaneously defended Megara from the Corinthians by sending out an army composed of those too young or old for regular military service. The following year, Sparta sent an army into Boeotia, reviving the power of Thebes in order to help hold the Athenians in check. Their return was blocked, and they resolved to march on Athens, where the Long Walls were not yet completed, winning a victory at the Battle of Tanagra. All this accomplished, however, was to allow them to return home via the Megarid. Two months later, the Athenians under Myronides invaded Boeotia, and winning the Battle of Oenophyta gained control of the whole country except Thebes.

Reverses followed peace with Persia in 449 BC. The Battle of Coronea, in 447 BC, led to the abandonment of Boeotia. Euboea and Megara revolted, and while the former was restored to its status as a tributary ally, the latter was a permanent loss. The Delian and Peloponnesian Leagues signed a peace treaty, which was set to endure for thirty years. It only lasted until 431 BC, when the Peloponnesian War broke out.

Those who revolted unsuccessfully during the war saw the example made of the Mytilenians, the principal people on Lesbos. After an unsuccessful revolt, the Athenians ordered the death of the entire male population. After some thought, they rescinded this order, and only put to death the leading 1000 ringleaders of the revolt, and redistributed the land of the entire island to Athenian shareholders, who were sent out to reside on Lesbos.

This type of treatment was not reserved solely for those who revolted. Thucydides documents the example of Melos, a small island, neutral in the war, though founded by Spartans. The Melians were offered a choice to join the Athenians, or be conquered. Choosing to resist, their town was besieged and conquered; the males were put to death and the women sold into slavery (see Melian dialogue).

==Athenian Empire (454–404 BC)==
By 454 BC, the Delian League could be fairly characterised as an Athenian Empire; a key event of 454 BC was the moving of the treasury of the Delian League from Delos to Athens. This is often seen as a key marker of the transition from alliance to empire, but while it is significant, it is important to view the period as a whole when considering the development of Athenian imperialism, and not to focus on a single event as being the main contributor to it. At the start of the Peloponnesian War, only Chios and Lesbos were left to contribute ships, and these states were by now far too weak to secede without support. Lesbos tried to revolt first, and failed completely. Chios, the most powerful of the original members of the Delian League save Athens, was the last to revolt, and in the aftermath of the Syracusan Expedition enjoyed success for several years, inspiring all of Ionia to revolt. Athens was nonetheless eventually able to suppress these revolts.

To further strengthen Athens&#x27;s grip on its empire, Pericles in 450 BC began a policy of establishing &quot;kleruchiai&quot;—quasi-colonies that remained tied to Athens and which served as garrisons to maintain control of the League&#x27;s vast territory. Furthermore, Pericles employed a number of offices to maintain Athens&#x27; empire: &quot;proxenoi&quot;, who fostered good relations between Athens and League members; &quot;episkopoi&quot; and &quot;archontes&quot;, who oversaw the collection of tribute; and &quot;hellenotamiai&quot;, who received the tribute on Athens&#x27; behalf.

Athens&#x27;s empire was not very stable and after 27 years of war, the Spartans, aided by the Persians and Athenian internal strife, were able to defeat it. However, it did not remain defeated for long. The Second Athenian League, a maritime self-defense league, was founded in 377 BC and was led by Athens. The Athenians would never recover the full extent of their power, and their enemies were now far stronger and more varied.

<text>August Horch (12 October 1868 – 3 February 1951) was a German engineer and automobile pioneer, the founder of the manufacturing giant that eventually became Audi.

==Beginnings==
Horch was born in Winningen, Rhenish Prussia. His initial trade was as a blacksmith, and then was educated at (Mittweida Technical College). After receiving a degree in engineering, he worked in shipbuilding. Horch worked for Karl Benz from 1896, before founding &quot;A. Horch &amp; Co.&quot; in November 1899, in Ehrenfeld, Cologne, Germany.

==Manufacturing==
The first Horch automobile was built in 1901. The company moved to Reichenbach in 1902 and Zwickau in 1904. Horch left the company in 1909 after a dispute, and set up in competition in Zwickau. His new firm was initially called &quot;Horch Automobil-Werke GmbH&quot;, but following a legal dispute over the &quot;Horch&quot; name, he decided to make another automobile company. (The court decided that &quot;Horch&quot; was a registered trademark on behalf of August&#x27;s former partners and August was not entitled to use it any more). Consequently, Horch named his new company &quot;Audi Automobilwerke GmbH&quot; in 1910, &quot;Audi&quot; being the Latinization of Horch.

==Post Audi==
Horch left Audi in 1920 and went to Berlin and took various jobs. He published his autobiography, &quot;I Built Cars ()&quot; in 1937. He also served on the board of Auto Union, the successor to Audi Automobilwerke GmbH he had founded. Horch remained an honorary executive at Auto Union during and after its reincorporation in Ingolstadt, Bavaria in the late 1940s until his death in 1951, ultimately not living to see the later resurrection of his Audi brand a decade later under the ownership of Volkswagen.

He was an honorary citizen of Zwickau and had a street named for his Audi cars in both Zwickau and his birthplace Winningen. He was made an honorary professor at Braunschweig University of Technology. There is an &quot;August Horchstrasse&quot; (August Horch Street) at Audi&#x27;s main manufacturing plant in Ingolstadt.

<doc id="2039" wikidata="Q221329" url="?curid=2039" title="Avionics">
<text>Avionics (a portmanteau of &quot;aviation&quot; and &quot;electronics&quot;) are the electronic systems used on aircraft. Avionic systems include communications, navigation, the display and management of multiple systems, and the hundreds of systems that are fitted to aircraft to perform individual functions. These can be as simple as a searchlight for a police helicopter or as complicated as the tactical system for an airborne early warning platform.

==History==
The term &quot;avionics&quot; was coined in 1949 by Philip J. Klass, senior editor at &quot;Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology&quot; magazine as a portmanteau of &quot;aviation electronics&quot;.

Radio communication was first used in aircraft just prior to World War I. The first airborne radios were in zeppelins, but the military sparked development of light radio sets that could be carried by heavier-than-air craft, so that aerial reconnaissance biplanes could report their observations immediately in case they were shot down. The first experimental radio transmission from an airplane was conducted by the U.S. Navy in August 1910. The first aircraft radios transmitted by radiotelegraphy. They required a two-seat aircraft with a second crewman who operated a telegraph key to spell out messages in Morse code. During World War I, AM voice two way radio sets were made possible in 1917 (see TM (triode)) by the development of the triode vacuum tube, which were simple enough that the pilot in a single seat aircraft could use it while flying.

Radar, the central technology used today in aircraft navigation and air traffic control, was developed by several nations, mainly in secret, as an air defense system in the 1930s during the runup to World War II. Many modern avionics have their origins in World War II wartime developments. For example, autopilot systems that are commonplace today began as specialized systems to help bomber planes fly steadily enough to hit precision targets from high altitudes. Britain&#x27;s 1940 decision to share its radar technology with its U.S. ally, particularly the magnetron vacuum tube, in the famous Tizard Mission, significantly shortened the war. Modern avionics is a substantial portion of military aircraft spending. Aircraft like the F-15E and the now retired F-14 have roughly 20 percent of their budget spent on avionics. Most modern helicopters now have budget splits of 60/40 in favour of avionics.

The civilian market has also seen a growth in cost of avionics. Flight control systems (fly-by-wire) and new navigation needs brought on by tighter airspaces, have pushed up development costs. The major change has been the recent boom in consumer flying. As more people begin to use planes as their primary method of transportation, more elaborate methods of controlling aircraft safely in these high restrictive airspaces have been invented.

===Modern avionics===
Avionics plays a heavy role in modernization initiatives like the Federal Aviation Administration&#x27;s (FAA) Next Generation Air Transportation System project in the United States and the Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) initiative in Europe. The Joint Planning and Development Office put forth a roadmap for avionics in six areas:
* Published Routes and Procedures – Improved navigation and routing
* Negotiated Trajectories – Adding data communications to create preferred routes dynamically
* Delegated Separation – Enhanced situational awareness in the air and on the ground
* LowVisibility/CeilingApproach/Departure – Allowing operations with weather constraints with less ground infrastructure
* Surface Operations – To increase safety in approach and departure
* ATM Efficiencies – Improving the air traffic management (ATM) process

===Market===

The Aircraft Electronics Association reports $1.73 billion avionics sales for the first three quarters of 2017 in business and general aviation, a 4.1% yearly improvement: 73.5% came from North America, forward-fit represented 42.3% while 57.7% were retrofits as the U.S. deadline of January 1, 2020 for mandatory ADS-B out approach.

==Aircraft avionics==
The cockpit or, in larger aircraft, under the cockpit of an aircraft or in a movable nosecone, is a typical location for avionic bay equipment, including control, monitoring, communication, navigation, weather, and anti-collision systems. The majority of aircraft power their avionics using 14- or 28‑volt DC electrical systems; however, larger, more sophisticated aircraft (such as airliners or military combat aircraft) have AC systems operating at 115 volts 400 Hz, AC. There are several major vendors of flight avionics, including The Boeing Company, Panasonic Avionics Corporation, Honeywell (which now owns Bendix/King), Universal Avionics Systems Corporation, Rockwell Collins (now Collins Aerospace), Thales Group, GE Aviation Systems, Garmin, Raytheon, Parker Hannifin, UTC Aerospace Systems (now Collins Aerospace), Selex ES (now Leonardo), Shadin Avionics, and Avidyne Corporation.

International standards for avionics equipment are prepared by the Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee (AEEC) and published by ARINC.

=== Avionics Installation ===
Avionics installation is a critical aspect of modern aviation, ensuring that aircraft are equipped with the necessary electronic systems for safe and efficient operation. These systems encompass a wide range of functions, including communication, navigation, monitoring, flight control, and weather detection. Avionics installations are performed on all types of aircraft, from small general aviation planes to large commercial jets and military aircraft.

==== Installation Process ====
The installation of avionics requires a combination of technical expertise, precision, and adherence to stringent regulatory standards. The process typically involves:
# Planning and Design: Before installation, the avionics shop works closely with the aircraft owner to determine the required systems based on the aircraft type, intended use, and regulatory requirements. Custom instrument panels are often designed to accommodate the new systems.
# Wiring and Integration: Avionics systems are integrated into the aircraft’s electrical and control systems, with wiring often requiring laser marking for durability and identification. Shops use detailed schematics to ensure correct installation.
# Testing and Calibration: After installation, each system must be thoroughly tested and calibrated to ensure proper function. This includes ground testing, flight testing, and system alignment with regulatory standards such as those set by the FAA.
# Certification: Once the systems are installed and tested, the avionics shop completes the necessary certifications. In the U.S., this often involves compliance with FAA Part 91.411 and 91.413 for IFR (Instrument Flight Rules) operations, as well as RVSM (Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum) certification.

==== Regulatory Standards ====
Avionics installation is governed by strict regulatory frameworks to ensure the safety and reliability of aircraft systems. In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) sets the standards for avionics installations. These include guidelines for:
* System Performance: Avionics systems must meet performance benchmarks as defined by the FAA, ensuring they function correctly in all phases of flight.
* Certification: Shops performing installations must be FAA-certified, and their technicians often hold certifications such as the General Radiotelephone Operator License (GROL).
* Inspections: Aircraft equipped with newly installed avionics systems must undergo rigorous inspections before being cleared for flight, including both ground and flight tests.

==== Advancements in Avionics Technology ====
The field of avionics has seen rapid technological advancements in recent years, leading to more integrated and automated systems. Key trends include:
* Glass Cockpits: Traditional analog gauges are being replaced by fully integrated glass cockpit displays, providing pilots with a centralized view of all flight parameters.
* NextGen Technologies: ADS-B and satellite-based navigation are part of the FAA’s NextGen initiative, aimed at modernizing air traffic control and improving the efficiency of the national airspace.
* Autonomous Systems: Advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning are paving the way for more autonomous aircraft systems, enhancing safety and reducing pilot workload.

===Communications===

Communications connect the flight deck to the ground and the flight deck to the passengers. On‑board communications are provided by public-address systems and aircraft intercoms.

The VHF aviation communication system works on the airband of 118.000 MHz to 136.975 MHz. Each channel is spaced from the adjacent ones by 8.33 kHz in Europe, 25 kHz elsewhere. VHF is also used for line of sight communication such as aircraft-to-aircraft and aircraft-to-ATC. Amplitude modulation (AM) is used, and the conversation is performed in simplex mode. Aircraft communication can also take place using HF (especially for trans-oceanic flights) or satellite communication.

===Navigation===
Air navigation is the determination of position and direction on or above the surface of the Earth. Avionics can use satellite navigation systems (such as GPS and WAAS), inertial navigation system (INS), ground-based radio navigation systems (such as VOR or LORAN), or any combination thereof. Some navigation systems such as GPS calculate the position automatically and display it to the flight crew on moving map displays. Older ground-based Navigation systems such as VOR or LORAN requires a pilot or navigator to plot the intersection of signals on a paper map to determine an aircraft&#x27;s location; modern systems calculate the position automatically and display it to the flight crew on moving map displays.

===Monitoring===


The first hints of glass cockpits emerged in the 1970s when flight-worthy cathode-ray tube (CRT) screens began to replace electromechanical displays, gauges and instruments. A &quot;glass&quot; cockpit refers to the use of computer monitors instead of gauges and other analog displays. Aircraft were getting progressively more displays, dials and information dashboards that eventually competed for space and pilot attention. In the 1970s, the average aircraft had more than 100 cockpit instruments and controls.
Glass cockpits started to come into being with the Gulfstream G‑IV private jet in 1985. One of the key challenges in glass cockpits is to balance how much control is automated and how much the pilot should do manually. Generally they try to automate flight operations while keeping the pilot constantly informed.

===Aircraft flight-control system===
Aircraft have means of automatically controlling flight. Autopilot was first invented by Lawrence Sperry during World War I to fly bomber planes steady enough to hit accurate targets from 25,000 feet. When it was first adopted by the U.S. military, a Honeywell engineer sat in the back seat with bolt cutters to disconnect the autopilot in case of emergency. Nowadays most commercial planes are equipped with aircraft flight control systems in order to reduce pilot error and workload at landing or takeoff.

The first simple commercial auto-pilots were used to control heading and altitude and had limited authority on things like thrust and flight control surfaces. In helicopters, auto-stabilization was used in a similar way. The first systems were electromechanical. The advent of fly-by-wire and electro-actuated flight surfaces (rather than the traditional hydraulic) has increased safety. As with displays and instruments, critical devices that were electro-mechanical had a finite life. With safety critical systems, the software is very strictly tested.

===Fuel Systems===
Fuel Quantity Indication System (FQIS) monitors the amount of fuel aboard. Using various sensors, such as capacitance tubes, temperature sensors, densitometers &amp; level sensors, the FQIS computer calculates the mass of fuel remaining on board.

Fuel Control and Monitoring System (FCMS) reports fuel remaining on board in a similar manner, but, by controlling pumps &amp; valves, also manages fuel transfers around various tanks.

* Refuelling control to upload to a certain total mass of fuel and distribute it automatically.
* Transfers during flight to the tanks that feed the engines. E.G. from fuselage to wing tanks
* Centre of gravity control transfers from the tail (trim) tanks forward to the wings as fuel is expended
* Maintaining fuel in the wing tips (to alleviate wing bending due to lift in flight) &amp; transferring to the main tanks after landing
* Controlling fuel jettison during an emergency to reduce the aircraft weight.

===Collision-avoidance systems===
To supplement air traffic control, most large transport aircraft and many smaller ones use a traffic alert and collision avoidance system (TCAS), which can detect the location of nearby aircraft, and provide instructions for avoiding a midair collision. Smaller aircraft may use simpler traffic alerting systems such as TPAS, which are passive (they do not actively interrogate the transponders of other aircraft) and do not provide advisories for conflict resolution.

To help avoid controlled flight into terrain (CFIT), aircraft use systems such as ground-proximity warning systems (GPWS), which use radar altimeters as a key element. One of the major weaknesses of GPWS is the lack of &quot;look-ahead&quot; information, because it only provides altitude above terrain &quot;look-down&quot;. In order to overcome this weakness, modern aircraft use a terrain awareness warning system (TAWS).

===Flight recorders===
Commercial aircraft cockpit data recorders, commonly known as &quot;black boxes&quot;, store flight information and audio from the cockpit. They are often recovered from an aircraft after a crash to determine control settings and other parameters during the incident.

===Weather systems===

Weather systems such as weather radar (typically Arinc 708 on commercial aircraft) and lightning detectors are important for aircraft flying at night or in instrument meteorological conditions, where it is not possible for pilots to see the weather ahead. Heavy precipitation (as sensed by radar) or severe turbulence (as sensed by lightning activity) are both indications of strong convective activity and severe turbulence, and weather systems allow pilots to deviate around these areas.

Lightning detectors like the Stormscope or Strikefinder have become inexpensive enough that they are practical for light aircraft. In addition to radar and lightning detection, observations and extended radar pictures (such as NEXRAD) are now available through satellite data connections, allowing pilots to see weather conditions far beyond the range of their own in-flight systems. Modern displays allow weather information to be integrated with moving maps, terrain, and traffic onto a single screen, greatly simplifying navigation.

Modern weather systems also include wind shear and turbulence detection and terrain and traffic warning systems. In‑plane weather avionics are especially popular in Africa, India, and other countries where air-travel is a growing market, but ground support is not as well developed.

===Aircraft management systems===
There has been a progression towards centralized control of the multiple complex systems fitted to aircraft, including engine monitoring and management. Health and usage monitoring systems (HUMS) are integrated with aircraft management computers to give maintainers early warnings of parts that will need replacement.

The integrated modular avionics concept proposes an integrated architecture with application software portable across an assembly of common hardware modules. It has been used in fourth generation jet fighters and the latest generation of airliners.

==Mission or tactical avionics==
Military aircraft have been designed either to deliver a weapon or to be the eyes and ears of other weapon systems. The vast array of sensors available to the military is used for whatever tactical means required. As with aircraft management, the bigger sensor platforms (like the E‑3D, JSTARS, ASTOR, Nimrod MRA4, Merlin HM Mk 1) have mission-management computers.

Police and EMS aircraft also carry sophisticated tactical sensors.

===Military communications===

While aircraft communications provide the backbone for safe flight, the tactical systems are designed to withstand the rigors of the battle field. UHF, VHF Tactical (30–88 MHz) and SatCom systems combined with ECCM methods, and cryptography secure the communications. Data links such as Link 11, 16, 22 and BOWMAN, JTRS and even TETRA provide the means of transmitting data (such as images, targeting information etc.).

===Radar===

Airborne radar was one of the first tactical sensors. The benefit of altitude providing range has meant a significant focus on airborne radar technologies. Radars include airborne early warning (AEW), anti-submarine warfare (ASW), and even weather radar (Arinc 708) and ground tracking/proximity radar.

The military uses radar in fast jets to help pilots fly at low levels. While the civil market has had weather radar for a while, there are strict rules about using it to navigate the aircraft.

===Sonar===

Dipping sonar fitted to a range of military helicopters allows the helicopter to protect shipping assets from submarines or surface threats. Maritime support aircraft can drop active and passive sonar devices (sonobuoys) and these are also used to determine the location of enemy submarines.

===Electro-optics===
Electro-optic systems include devices such as the head-up display (HUD), forward looking infrared (FLIR), infrared search and track and other passive infrared devices (Passive infrared sensor). These are all used to provide imagery and information to the flight crew. This imagery is used for everything from search and rescue to navigational aids and target acquisition.

===ESM/DAS===

Electronic support measures and defensive aids systems are used extensively to gather information about threats or possible threats. They can be used to launch devices (in some cases automatically) to counter direct threats against the aircraft. They are also used to determine the state of a threat and identify it.

===Aircraft networks===
The avionics systems in military, commercial and advanced models of civilian aircraft are interconnected using an avionics databus. Common avionics databus protocols, with their primary application, include:
* Aircraft Data Network (ADN): Ethernet derivative for Commercial Aircraft
* Avionics Full-Duplex Switched Ethernet (AFDX): Specific implementation of ARINC 664 (ADN) for Commercial Aircraft
* ARINC 429: Generic Medium-Speed Data Sharing for Private and Commercial Aircraft

<text>Ares (; , &quot;Árēs&quot; ) is the Greek god of war and courage. He is one of the Twelve Olympians, and the son of Zeus and Hera. The Greeks were ambivalent towards him. He embodies the physical valor necessary for success in war but can also personify sheer brutality and bloodlust, in contrast to his sister Athena, whose martial functions include military strategy and generalship. An association with Ares endows places, objects, and other deities with a savage, dangerous, or militarized quality.

Although Ares&#x27; name shows his origins as Mycenaean, his reputation for savagery was thought by some to reflect his likely origins as a Thracian deity. Some cities in Greece and several in Asia Minor held annual festivals to bind and detain him as their protector. In parts of Asia Minor, he was an oracular deity. Still further away from Greece, the Scythians were said to ritually kill one in a hundred prisoners of war as an offering to their equivalent of Ares. The later belief that ancient Spartans had offered human sacrifice to Ares may owe more to mythical prehistory, misunderstandings, and reputation than to reality.

Although there are many literary allusions to Ares&#x27; love affairs and children, he has a limited role in Greek mythology. When he does appear, he is often humiliated. In the Trojan War, Aphrodite, protector of Troy, persuades Ares to take the Trojans&#x27; side. The Trojans lose, while Ares&#x27; sister Athena helps the Greeks to victory. Most famously, when the craftsman-god Hephaestus discovers his wife Aphrodite is having an affair with Ares, he traps the lovers in a net and exposes them to the ridicule of the other gods.

Ares&#x27; nearest counterpart in Roman religion is Mars, who was given a more important and dignified place in ancient Roman religion as ancestral protector of the Roman people and state. During the Hellenization of Latin literature, the myths of Ares were reinterpreted by Roman writers under the name of Mars, and in later Western art and literature, the mythology of the two figures became virtually indistinguishable.

==Names==
The etymology of the name &quot;Ares&quot; is traditionally connected with the Greek word (&quot;arē&quot;), the Ionic form of the Doric (&quot;ara&quot;), &quot;bane, ruin, curse, imprecation&quot;. Walter Burkert notes that &quot;Ares is apparently an ancient abstract noun meaning throng of battle, war.&quot; R. S. P. Beekes has suggested a Pre-Greek origin of the name. The earliest attested form of the name is the Mycenaean Greek , &quot;a-re&quot;, written in the Linear B syllabic script.

The adjectival epithet, &quot;Areios&quot; (&quot;warlike&quot;) was frequently appended to the names of other gods when they took on a warrior aspect or became involved in warfare: &quot;Zeus Areios&quot;, &quot;Athena Areia&quot;, even Aphrodite Areia (&quot;Aphrodite within Ares&quot; or &quot;feminine Ares&quot;), who was warlike, fully armoured and armed, partnered with Athena in Sparta, and represented at Kythira&#x27;s temple to Aphrodite Urania.
In the &quot;Iliad&quot;, the word &quot;ares&quot; is used as a common noun synonymous with &quot;battle.&quot;

In the Classical period, Ares is given the epithet Enyalios, which seems to appear on the Mycenaean KN V 52 tablet as , &quot;e-nu-wa-ri-jo&quot;. Enyalios was sometimes identified with Ares and sometimes differentiated from him as another war god with separate cult, even in the same town; Burkert describes them as &quot;doubles almost&quot;.

==Cult==

In mainland Greece and the Peloponnese, only a few places are known to have had a formal temple and cult of Ares. Pausanias (2nd century AD) notes an altar to Ares at Olympia, and the moving of a Temple of Ares to the Athenian agora during the reign of Augustus, essentially rededicating it (2 AD) as a Roman temple to the Augustan Mars Ultor. The Areopagus (&quot;mount of Ares&quot;), a natural rock outcrop in Athens, some distance from the Acropolis, was supposedly where Ares was tried and acquitted by the gods for his revenge-killing of Poseidon&#x27;s son, Halirrhothius, who had raped Ares&#x27; daughter Alcippe. Its name was used for the court that met there, mostly to investigate and try potential cases of treason.

Numismatist M. Jessop Price states that Ares &quot;typified the traditional Spartan character&quot;, but had no important cult in Sparta; and he never occurs on Spartan coins. Pausanias gives two examples of his cult, both of them conjointly with or &quot;within&quot; a warlike Aphrodite, on the Spartan acropolis. Gonzalez observes, in his 2005 survey of Ares&#x27; cults in Asia Minor, that cults to Ares on the Greek mainland may have been more common than some sources assert. Wars between Greek states were endemic; war and warriors provided Ares&#x27;s tribute, and fed his insatiable appetite for battle.

Ares&#x27; attributes are instruments of war: a helmet, shield, and sword or spear. Libanius &quot;makes the apple sacred to Ares&quot;, but &quot;offers no further comment&quot;, nor connections to any aetiological myth. Apples are one of Aphrodites&#x27; sacred or symbolic fruits. Littlewood follows Artemidorus claim that to dream of sour apples presages conflict, and lists Ares alongside Eris and the mythological &quot;Apples of Discord&quot;.

===Chained statues===
Gods were immortal but could be bound and restrained, both in mythic narrative and in cult practice. There was an archaic Spartan statue of Ares in chains in the temple of Enyalios (sometimes regarded as the son of Ares, sometimes as Ares himself), which Pausanias claimed meant that the spirit of war and victory was to be kept in the city. The Spartans are known to have ritually bound the images of other deities, including Aphrodite and Artemis (cf Ares and Aphrodite bound by Hephaestus), and in other places there were chained statues of Artemis and Dionysos.

Statues of Ares in chains are described in the instructions given by an oracle of the late Hellenistic era to various cities of Pamphylia (in Anatolia) including Syedra, Lycia and Cilicia, places almost perpetually under threat from pirates. Each was told to set up a statue of &quot;bloody, man-slaying Ares&quot; and provide it with an annual festival in which it was ritually bound with iron fetters (&quot;by Dike and Hermes&quot;) as if a supplicant for justice, put on trial and offered sacrifice. The oracle promises that &quot;thus will he become a peaceful deity for you, once he has driven the enemy horde far from your country, and he will give rise to prosperity much prayed for.&quot; This Ares &quot;karpodotes&quot; (&quot;giver of Fruits&quot;) is well attested in Lycia and Pisidia.

===Sacrifices===
Like most Greek deities, Ares was given animal sacrifice; in Sparta, after battle, he was given an ox for a victory by stratagem, or a rooster for victory through onslaught. The usual recipient of sacrifice before battle was Athena. Reports of historic human sacrifice to Ares in an obscure rite known as the &quot;Hekatomphonia&quot; represent a very long-standing error, repeated through several centuries and well into the modern era. The &quot;hekatomphonia&quot; was an animal sacrifice to Zeus; it could be offered by any warrior who had personally slain one hundred of the enemy. Pausanias reports that in Sparta, each company of youths sacrificed a puppy to Enyalios before engaging in a hand-to-hand &quot;fight without rules&quot; at the Phoebaeum. The chthonic night-time sacrifice of a dog to Enyalios became assimilated to the cult of Ares. Porphyry claims, without detail, that Apollodorus of Athens (circa second century BC) says the Spartans made human sacrifices to Ares, but this may be a reference to mythic pre-history.

===Thrace and Scythia===
A Thracian god identified by Herodotus ( – ) as Ares, through &quot;interpretatio Graeca&quot;, was one of three otherwise unnamed deities that Thracian commoners were said to worship. Herodotus recognises and names the other two as &quot;Dionysus&quot; and &quot;Artemis&quot;, and claims that the Thracian aristocracy exclusively worshiped &quot;Hermes&quot;. In Herodotus&#x27; &quot;Histories&quot;, the Scythians worship an indigenous form of Greek Ares, who is otherwise unnamed, but ranked beneath Tabiti (whom Herodotus claims as a form of Hestia), Api and Papaios in Scythia&#x27;s divine hierarchy. His cult object was an iron sword. The &quot;Scythian Ares&quot; was offered blood-sacrifices (or ritual killings) of cattle, horses and &quot;one in every hundred human war-captives&quot;, whose blood was used to douse the sword. Statues, and complex platform-altars made of heaped brushwood were devoted to him. This sword-cult, or one very similar, is said to have persisted among the Alans. Some have posited that the &quot;Sword of Mars&quot; in later European history alludes to the Huns having adopted Ares.

===Asia Minor===
In some parts of Asia Minor, Ares was a prominent oracular deity, something not found in any Hellennic cult to Ares or Roman cult to Mars. Ares was linked in some regions or polities with a local god or cultic hero, and recognised as a higher, more prestigious deity than in mainland Greece. His cults in southern Asia Minor are attested from the 5th century BC and well into the later Roman Imperial era, at 29 different sites, and on over 70 local coin issues. He is sometimes represented on coinage of the region by the &quot;Helmet of Ares&quot; or carrying a spear and a shield, or as a fully armed warrior, sometimes accompanied by a female deity. In what is now western Turkey, the Hellenistic city of Metropolis built a monumental temple to Ares as the city&#x27;s protector, not before the 3rd century BC. It is now lost, but the names of some of its priests and priestesses survive, along with the temple&#x27;s likely depictions on coins of the province.

===Crete===
A sanctuary of Aphrodite was established at Sta Lenika, on Crete, between the cities of Lato and Olus, possibly during the Geometric period. It was rebuilt in the late 2nd century BC as a double-sanctuary to Ares and Aphrodite. Inscriptions record disputes over the ownership of the sanctuary. The names of Ares and Aphrodite appear as witness to sworn oaths, and there is a Victory thanks-offering to Aphrodite, whom Millington believes had capacity as a &quot;warrior-protector acting in the realm of Ares&quot;. There were cultic links between the Sta Lenika sanctuary, Knossos and other Cretan states, and perhaps with Argos on the mainland. While the Greek literary and artistic record from both the Archaic and Classical eras connects Ares and Aphrodite as complementary companions and ideal though adulterous lovers, their cult pairing and Aphrodite as warrior-protector is localised to Crete.

===Aksum===
In Africa, Maḥrem, the principal god of the kings of Aksum prior to the 4th century AD, was invoked as Ares in Greek inscriptions. The anonymous king who commissioned the Monumentum Adulitanum in the late 2nd or early 3rd century refers to &quot;my greatest god, Ares, who also begat me, through whom I brought under my sway [various peoples]&quot;. The monumental throne celebrating the king&#x27;s conquests was itself dedicated to Ares. In the early 4th century, the last pagan king of Aksum, Ezana, referred to &quot;the one who brought me forth, the invincible Ares&quot;.

==Characterisation==

Ares was one of the Twelve Olympians in the archaic tradition represented by the &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey.&quot; In Greek literature, Ares often represents the physical or violent and untamed aspect of war and is the personification of sheer brutality and bloodlust (&quot;overwhelming, insatiable in battle, destructive, and man-slaughtering&quot;, as Burkert puts it), in contrast to his sister, the armored Athena, whose functions as a goddess of intelligence include military strategy and generalship. An association with Ares endows places and objects with a savage, dangerous, or militarized quality; but when Ares does appear in myths, he typically faces humiliation.

In the Iliad, Zeus expresses a recurring Greek revulsion toward the god when Ares returns wounded and complaining from the battlefield at Troy:
This ambivalence is expressed also in the Greeks&#x27; association of Ares with the Thracians, whom they regarded as a barbarous and warlike people. Thrace was considered to be Ares&#x27;s birthplace and his refuge after the affair with Aphrodite was exposed to the general mockery of the other gods.

A late-6th-century BC funerary inscription from Attica emphasizes the consequences of coming under Ares&#x27;s sway:

== Mythology ==
===Birth===
He is one of the Twelve Olympians, and the son of Zeus and Hera.

===Argonautica===
In the &quot;Argonautica&quot;, the &quot;Golden Fleece&quot; hangs in a grove sacred to Ares, until its theft by Jason. The Birds of Ares (&quot;Ornithes Areioi&quot;) drop feather darts in defense of the Amazons&#x27; shrine to Ares, as father of their queen, on a coastal island in the Black Sea.

===Founding of Thebes===
Ares plays a central role in the founding myth of Thebes, as the progenitor of the water-dragon slain by Cadmus. The dragon&#x27;s teeth were sown into the ground as if a crop and sprang up as the fully armored autochthonic Spartoi. Cadmus placed himself in the god&#x27;s service for eight years to atone for killing the dragon. To further propitiate Ares, Cadmus married Harmonia, a daughter of Ares&#x27;s union with Aphrodite. In this way, Cadmus harmonized all strife and founded the city of Thebes. In reality, Thebes came to dominate Boeotia&#x27;s great and fertile plain, which in both history and myth was a battleground for competing polities. According to Plutarch, the plain was anciently described as &quot;The dancing-floor of Ares&quot;.

===Aphrodite===
In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, in the tale sung by the bard in the hall of Alcinous, the Sun-god Helios once spied Ares and Aphrodite having sex secretly in the hall of Hephaestus, her husband. Helios reported the incident to Hephaestus. Contriving to catch the illicit couple in the act, Hephaestus fashioned a finely-knitted and nearly invisible net with which to snare them. At the appropriate time, this net was sprung, and trapped Ares and Aphrodite locked in very private embrace.

But Hephaestus was not satisfied with his revenge, so he invited the Olympian gods and goddesses to view the unfortunate pair. For the sake of modesty, the goddesses demurred, but the male gods went to witness the sight. Some commented on the beauty of Aphrodite, others remarked that they would eagerly trade places with Ares, but all who were present mocked the two. Once the couple was released, the embarrassed Ares returned to his homeland, Thrace, and Aphrodite went to Paphos.

In a much later interpolated detail, Ares put the young soldier Alectryon, who was Ares companion in drinking and even love-making, by his door to warn them of Helios&#x27;s arrival as Helios would tell Hephaestus of Aphrodite&#x27;s infidelity if the two were discovered, but Alectryon fell asleep on guard duty. Helios discovered the two and alerted Hephaestus. The furious Ares turned the sleepy Alectryon into a rooster which now always announces the arrival of the sun in the morning, as a way of apologizing to Ares.

The Chorus of Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;Suppliants&quot; (written 463 BC) refers to Ares as Aphrodite&#x27;s &quot;mortal-destroying bedfellow&quot;. In the &quot;Illiad&quot;, Ares helps the Trojans because of his affection for their divine protector, Aphrodite; she thus redirects his innate destructive savagery to her own purposes.

===Giants===
In one archaic myth, related only in the &quot;Iliad&quot; by the goddess Dione to her daughter Aphrodite, two chthonic giants, the Aloadae, named Otus and Ephialtes, bound Ares in chains and imprisoned him in a bronze urn, where he remained for thirteen months, a lunar year. &quot;And that would have been the end of Ares and his appetite for war, if the beautiful Eriboea, the young giants&#x27; stepmother, had not told Hermes what they had done,&quot; she related. In this, [Burkert] suspects &quot;a festival of licence which is unleashed in the thirteenth month.&quot; Ares was held screaming and howling in the urn until Hermes rescued him, and Artemis tricked the Aloadae into slaying each other. In Nonnus&#x27;s &quot;Dionysiaca&quot;, in the war between Cronus and Zeus, Ares killed an unnamed giant son of Echidna who was allied with Cronus, and described as spitting &quot;horrible poison&quot; and having &quot;snaky&quot; feet. 

In the 2nd century AD &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; of Antoninus Liberalis, when the monstrous Typhon attacked Olympus the gods transformed into animals and fled to Egypt; Ares changed into a fish, the Lepidotus (sacred to the Egyptian war-god Anhur). Liberalis&#x27;s koine Greek text is a &quot;completely inartistic&quot; epitome of Nicander&#x27;s now lost &quot;Heteroeumena&quot; (2nd century BC).

===&quot;Iliad&quot;===
In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, Ares has no fixed allegiance. He promises Athena and Hera that he will fight for the Achaeans but Aphrodite persuades him to side with the Trojans. During the war, Diomedes fights Hector and sees Ares fighting on the Trojans&#x27; side. Diomedes calls for his soldiers to withdraw. Zeus grants Athena permission to drive Ares from the battlefield. Encouraged by Hera and Athena, Diomedes thrusts with his spear at Ares. Athena drives the spear home, and all sides tremble at Ares&#x27;s cries. Ares flees to Mount Olympus, forcing the Trojans to fall back. Ares overhears that his son Ascalaphus has been killed and wants to change sides again, rejoining the Achaeans for vengeance, disregarding Zeus&#x27;s order that no Olympian should join the battle. Athena stops him. Later, when Zeus allows the gods to fight in the war again, Ares attacks Athena to avenge his previous injury. Athena overpowers him by striking him with a boulder.

===Attendants===
Deimos (&quot;Terror&quot; or &quot;Dread&quot;) and Phobos (&quot;Fear&quot;) are Ares&#x27; companions in war, and according to Hesiod, are also his children by Aphrodite. Eris, the goddess of discord, or Enyo, the goddess of war, bloodshed, and violence, was considered the sister and companion of the violent Ares. In at least one tradition, Enyalius, rather than another name for Ares, was his son by Enyo.

Ares may also be accompanied by Kydoimos, the daemon of the din of battle; the Makhai (&quot;Battles&quot;); the &quot;Hysminai&quot; (&quot;Acts of manslaughter&quot;); Polemos, a minor spirit of war, or only an epithet of Ares, since it has no specific dominion; and Polemos&#x27;s daughter, Alala, the goddess or personification of the Greek war-cry, whose name Ares uses as his own war-cry. Ares&#x27;s sister Hebe (&quot;Youth&quot;) also draws baths for him.

According to Pausanias, local inhabitants of Therapne, Sparta, recognized Thero, &quot;feral, savage,&quot; as a nurse of Ares.

===Offspring and affairs===
Though Ares plays a relatively limited role in Greek mythology as represented in literary narratives, his numerous love affairs and abundant offspring are often alluded to.
The union of Ares and Aphrodite created the gods Eros, Anteros, Phobos, Deimos, and Harmonia. Other versions include Alcippe as one of his daughters.

Cycnus (Κύκνος) of Macedonia was a son of Ares who tried to build a temple to his father with the skulls and bones of guests and travellers. Heracles fought him and, in one account, killed him. In another account, Ares fought his son&#x27;s killer but Zeus parted the combatants with a thunderbolt.

Ares had a romantic liaison with Eos, the goddess of the dawn. Aphrodite discovered them, and in anger she cursed Eos with insatiable lust for men.

By a woman named Teirene he had a daughter named Thrassa, who in turn had a daughter named Polyphonte. Polyphonte was cursed by Aphrodite to love and mate with a bear, producing two sons, Agrius and Oreius, who were hubristic toward the gods and had a habit of eating their guests. Zeus sent Hermes to punish them, and he chose to chop off their hands and feet. Since Polyphonte was descended from him, Ares stopped Hermes, and the two brothers came into an agreement to turn Polyphonte&#x27;s family into birds instead. Oreius became an eagle owl, Agrius a vulture, and Polyphonte a strix, possibly a small owl, certainly a portent of war; Polyphonte&#x27;s servant prayed not to become a bird of evil omen and Ares and Hermes fulfilled her wish by choosing the woodpecker for her, a good omen for hunters.

====List of offspring and their mothers====
Sometimes poets and dramatists recounted ancient traditions, which varied, and sometimes they invented new details; later scholiasts might draw on either or simply guess. Thus while Phobos and Deimos were regularly described as offspring of Ares, others listed here such as Meleager, Sinope and Solymus were sometimes said to be children of Ares and sometimes given other fathers.

The following is a list of Ares&#x27; offspring, by various mothers. Beside each offspring, the earliest source to record the parentage is given, along with the century to which the source dates.


==Mars==
The nearest counterpart of Ares among the Roman gods is Mars, a son of Jupiter and Juno, pre-eminent among the Roman army&#x27;s military gods but originally an agricultural deity. As a father of Romulus, Rome&#x27;s legendary founder, Mars was given an important and dignified place in ancient Roman religion, as a guardian deity of the entire Roman state and its people. Under the influence of Greek culture, Mars was identified with Ares, but the character and dignity of the two deities differed fundamentally. Mars was represented as a means to secure peace, and he was a father &quot;(pater)&quot; of the Roman people. In one tradition, he fathered Romulus and Remus through his rape of Rhea Silvia. In another, his lover, the goddess Venus, gave birth to Aeneas, the Trojan prince and refugee who &quot;founded&quot; Rome several generations before Romulus.

In the Hellenization of Latin literature, the myths of Ares were reinterpreted by Roman writers under the name of Mars. Greek writers under Roman rule also recorded cult practices and beliefs pertaining to Mars under the name of Ares. Thus in the classical tradition of later Western art and literature, the mythology of the two figures later became virtually indistinguishable.

==Renaissance and later depictions==
In Renaissance and Neoclassical works of art, Ares&#x27;s symbols are a spear and helmet, his animal is a dog, and his bird is the vulture. In literary works of these eras, Ares is replaced by the Roman Mars, a romantic emblem of manly valor rather than the cruel and blood-thirsty god of Greek mythology.

<text>Alexander Grothendieck, later Alexandre Grothendieck in French (; ; ; 28 March 1928 – 13 November 2014), was a German-born French mathematician who became the leading figure in the creation of modern algebraic geometry. His research extended the scope of the field and added elements of commutative algebra, homological algebra, sheaf theory, and category theory to its foundations, while his so-called &quot;relative&quot; perspective led to revolutionary advances in many areas of pure mathematics. He is considered by many to be the greatest mathematician of the twentieth century.

Grothendieck began his productive and public career as a mathematician in 1949. In 1958, he was appointed a research professor at the Institut des hautes études scientifiques (IHÉS) and remained there until 1970, when, driven by personal and political convictions, he left following a dispute over military funding. He received the Fields Medal in 1966 for advances in algebraic geometry, homological algebra, and K-theory. He later became professor at the University of Montpellier and, while still producing relevant mathematical work, he withdrew from the mathematical community and devoted himself to political and religious pursuits (first Buddhism and later, a more Catholic Christian vision). In 1991, he moved to the French village of Lasserre in the Pyrenees, where he lived in seclusion, still working on mathematics and his philosophical and religious thoughts until his death in 2014.

== Life ==

=== Family and childhood ===
Grothendieck was born in Berlin to anarchist parents. His father, Alexander &quot;Sascha&quot; Schapiro (also known as Alexander Tanaroff), had Hasidic Jewish roots and had been imprisoned in Russia before moving to Germany in 1922, while his mother, Johanna &quot;Hanka&quot; Grothendieck, came from a Protestant German family in Hamburg and worked as a journalist. As teenagers, both of his parents had broken away from their early backgrounds. At the time of his birth, Grothendieck&#x27;s mother was married to the journalist Johannes Raddatz and initially, his birth name was recorded as &quot;Alexander Raddatz.&quot; That marriage was dissolved in 1929 and Schapiro acknowledged his paternity, but never married Hanka Grothendieck. Grothendieck had a maternal sibling, his half sister Maidi.

Grothendieck lived with his parents in Berlin until the end of 1933, when his father moved to Paris to evade Nazism. His mother followed soon thereafter. Grothendieck was left in the care of Wilhelm Heydorn, a Lutheran pastor and teacher in Hamburg. According to Winfried Scharlau, during this time, his parents took part in the Spanish Civil War as non-combatant auxiliaries. However, others state that Schapiro fought in the anarchist militia.

=== World War II ===
In May 1939, Grothendieck was put on a train in Hamburg for France. Shortly afterward his father was interned in Le Vernet. He and his mother were then interned in various camps from 1940 to 1942 as &quot;undesirable dangerous foreigners.&quot; The first camp was the Rieucros Camp, where his mother contracted the tuberculosis that would eventually cause her death in 1957. While there, Grothendieck managed to attend the local school, at Mendel. Once, he managed to escape from the camp, intending to assassinate Hitler. Later, his mother Hanka was transferred to the Gurs internment camp for the remainder of World War II. Grothendieck was permitted to live separated from his mother.

In the village of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, he was sheltered and hidden in local boarding houses or pensions, although he occasionally had to seek refuge in the woods during Nazi raids, surviving at times without food or water for several days.

His father was arrested under the Vichy anti-Jewish legislation, and sent to the Drancy internment camp, and then handed over by the French Vichy government to the Germans to be sent to be murdered at the Auschwitz concentration camp in 1942.

In Le Chambon, Grothendieck attended the Collège Cévenol (now known as the Le Collège-Lycée Cévenol International), a unique secondary school founded in 1938 by local Protestant pacifists and anti-war activists. Many of the refugee children hidden in Le Chambon attended Collège Cévenol, and it was at this school that Grothendieck apparently first became fascinated with mathematics.

In 1990, for risking their lives to rescue Jews, the entire village was recognized as &quot;Righteous Among the Nations&quot;.

=== Studies and contact with research mathematics ===
After the war, the young Grothendieck studied mathematics in France, initially at the University of Montpellier where at first he did not perform well, failing such classes as astronomy. Working on his own, he rediscovered the Lebesgue measure. After three years of increasingly independent studies there, he went to continue his studies in Paris in 1948.

Initially, Grothendieck attended Henri Cartan&#x27;s Seminar at , but he lacked the necessary background to follow the high-powered seminar. On the advice of Cartan and André Weil, he moved to the University of Nancy where two leading experts were working on Grothendieck&#x27;s area of interest, topological vector spaces: Jean Dieudonné and Laurent Schwartz. The latter had recently won a Fields Medal. Dieudonné and Schwartz showed the new student their latest paper &quot;La dualité dans les espaces () et ()&quot;; it ended with a list of 14 open questions, relevant for locally convex spaces. Grothendieck introduced new mathematical methods that enabled him to solve all of these problems within a few months.

In Nancy, he wrote his dissertation under those two professors on functional analysis, from 1950 to 1953. At this time he was a leading expert in the theory of topological vector spaces. In 1953 he moved to the University of São Paulo in Brazil, where he immigrated by means of a Nansen passport, given that he had refused to take French nationality (as that would have entailed military service against his convictions). He stayed in São Paulo (apart from a lengthy visit in France from October 1953 to March 1954) until the end of 1954. His published work from the time spent in Brazil is still in the theory of topological vector spaces; it is there that he completed his last major work on that topic (on &quot;metric&quot; theory of Banach spaces).

Grothendieck moved to Lawrence, Kansas at the beginning of 1955, and there he set his old subject aside in order to work in algebraic topology and homological algebra, and increasingly in algebraic geometry. It was in Lawrence that Grothendieck developed his theory of abelian categories and the reformulation of sheaf cohomology based on them, leading to the very influential &quot;Tôhoku paper&quot;.

In 1957 he was invited to visit Harvard University by Oscar Zariski, but the offer fell through when he refused to sign a pledge promising not to work to overthrow the United States government—a refusal which, he was warned, threatened to land him in prison. The prospect of prison did not worry him, so long as he could have access to books.

Comparing Grothendieck during his Nancy years to the -trained students at that time (Pierre Samuel, Roger Godement, René Thom, Jacques Dixmier, Jean Cerf, Yvonne Bruhat, Jean-Pierre Serre, and Bernard Malgrange), Leila Schneps said:

 His first works on topological vector spaces in 1953 have been successfully applied to physics and computer science, culminating in a relation between Grothendieck inequality and the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox in quantum physics.

=== IHÉS years ===
In 1958, Grothendieck was installed at the Institut des hautes études scientifiques (IHÉS), a new privately funded research institute that, in effect, had been created for Jean Dieudonné and Grothendieck. Grothendieck attracted attention by an intense and highly productive activity of seminars there (&quot;de facto&quot; working groups drafting into foundational work some of the ablest French and other mathematicians of the younger generation). Grothendieck practically ceased publication of papers through the conventional, learned journal route. However, he was able to play a dominant role in mathematics for approximately a decade, gathering a strong school.

Officially during this time, he had as students Michel Demazure (who worked on SGA3, on group schemes), (relative schemes and classifying topos), Luc Illusie (cotangent complex), Michel Raynaud, Michèle Raynaud, Jean-Louis Verdier (co-founder of the derived category theory), and Pierre Deligne. Collaborators on the SGA projects also included Michael Artin (étale cohomology), Nick Katz (monodromy theory, and Lefschetz pencils). Jean Giraud worked out torsor theory extensions of nonabelian cohomology there as well. Many others such as David Mumford, Robin Hartshorne, Barry Mazur and C.P. Ramanujam were also involved.

=== &quot;Golden Age&quot; ===
Alexander Grothendieck&#x27;s work during what is described as the &quot;Golden Age&quot; period at the IHÉS established several unifying themes in algebraic geometry, number theory, topology, category theory, and complex analysis. His first (pre-IHÉS) discovery in algebraic geometry was the Grothendieck–Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem, a generalisation of the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem proved algebraically; in this context he also introduced K-theory. Then, following the programme he outlined in his talk at the 1958 International Congress of Mathematicians, he introduced the theory of schemes, developing it in detail in his &quot;Éléments de géométrie algébrique&quot; (&quot;EGA&quot;) and providing the new more flexible and general foundations for algebraic geometry that has been adopted in the field since that time. He went on to introduce the étale cohomology theory of schemes, providing the key tools for proving the Weil conjectures, as well as crystalline cohomology and algebraic de Rham cohomology to complement it. Closely linked to these cohomology theories, he originated topos theory as a generalisation of topology (relevant also in categorical logic). He also provided, by means of a categorical Galois theory, an algebraic definition of fundamental groups of schemes giving birth to the now famous étale fundamental group and he then conjectured the existence of a further generalization of it, which is now known as the fundamental group scheme. As a framework for his coherent duality theory, he also introduced derived categories, which were further developed by Verdier.

The results of his work on these and other topics were published in the &quot;EGA&quot; and in less polished form in the notes of the &quot;Séminaire de géométrie algébrique&quot; (&quot;SGA&quot;) that he directed at the IHÉS.

=== Political activism ===
Grothendieck&#x27;s political views were radical and pacifistic. He strongly opposed both United States intervention in Vietnam and Soviet military expansionism. To protest against the Vietnam War, he gave lectures on category theory in the forests surrounding Hanoi while the city was being bombed. In 1966, he had declined to attend the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in Moscow, where he was to receive the Fields Medal. He retired from scientific life around 1970 after he had found out that IHÉS was partly funded by the military. He returned to academia a few years later as a professor at the University of Montpellier.

While the issue of military funding was perhaps the most obvious explanation for Grothendieck&#x27;s departure from the IHÉS, those who knew him say that the causes of the rupture ran more deeply. Pierre Cartier, a &quot;visiteur de longue durée&quot; (&quot;long-term guest&quot;) at the IHÉS, wrote a piece about Grothendieck for a special volume published on the occasion of the IHÉS&#x27;s fortieth anniversary. In that publication, Cartier notes that as the son of an antimilitary anarchist and one who grew up among the disenfranchised, Grothendieck always had a deep compassion for the poor and the downtrodden. As Cartier puts it, Grothendieck came to find Bures-sur-Yvette as &quot;une cage dorée&quot; (&quot;a gilded cage&quot;). While Grothendieck was at the IHÉS, opposition to the Vietnam War was heating up, and Cartier suggests that this also reinforced Grothendieck&#x27;s distaste at having become a mandarin of the scientific world. In addition, after several years at the IHÉS, Grothendieck seemed to cast about for new intellectual interests. By the late 1960s, he had started to become interested in scientific areas outside mathematics. David Ruelle, a physicist who joined the IHÉS faculty in 1964, said that Grothendieck came to talk to him a few times about physics. Biology interested Grothendieck much more than physics, and he organized some seminars on biological topics.

In 1970, Grothendieck, with two other mathematicians, Claude Chevalley and Pierre Samuel, created a political group entitled &quot;Survivre&quot;—the name later changed to &quot;Survivre et vivre&quot;. The group published a bulletin and was dedicated to antimilitary and ecological issues. It also developed strong criticism of the indiscriminate use of science and technology. Grothendieck devoted the next three years to this group and served as the main editor of its bulletin.

Although Grothendieck continued with mathematical enquiries, his standard mathematical career mostly ended when he left the IHÉS. After leaving the IHÉS, Grothendieck became a temporary professor at Collège de France for two years. He then became a professor at the University of Montpellier, where he became increasingly estranged from the mathematical community. He formally retired in 1988, a few years after having accepted a research position at the CNRS.

=== Manuscripts written in the 1980s ===
While not publishing mathematical research in conventional ways during the 1980s, he produced several influential manuscripts with limited distribution, with both mathematical and biographical content.

Produced during 1980 and 1981, &quot;La Longue Marche à travers la théorie de Galois&quot; (&quot;The Long March Through Galois Theory&quot;) is a 1600-page handwritten manuscript containing many of the ideas that led to the &quot;Esquisse d&#x27;un programme&quot;. It also includes a study of Teichmüller theory.

In 1983, stimulated by correspondence with Ronald Brown and Tim Porter at Bangor University, Grothendieck wrote a 600-page manuscript entitled &quot;Pursuing Stacks&quot;. It began with a letter addressed to Daniel Quillen. This letter and successive parts were distributed from Bangor (see External links below). Within these, in an informal, diary-like manner, Grothendieck explained and developed his ideas on the relationship between algebraic homotopy theory and algebraic geometry and prospects for a noncommutative theory of stacks. The manuscript, which is being edited for publication by G. Maltsiniotis, later led to another of his monumental works, &quot;Les Dérivateurs&quot;. Written in 1991, this latter opus of approximately 2000 pages, further developed the homotopical ideas begun in &quot;Pursuing Stacks&quot;. Much of this work anticipated the subsequent development during the mid-1990s of the motivic homotopy theory of Fabien Morel and Vladimir Voevodsky.

In 1984, Grothendieck wrote the proposal &quot;Esquisse d&#x27;un Programme&quot; (&quot;Sketch of a Programme&quot;) for a position at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS). It describes new ideas for studying the moduli space of complex curves. Although Grothendieck never published his work in this area, the proposal inspired other mathematicians to work in the area by becoming the source of dessin d&#x27;enfant theory and anabelian geometry. Later, it was published in two-volumes and entitled &quot;Geometric Galois Actions&quot; (Cambridge University Press, 1997).

During this period, Grothendieck also gave his consent to publishing some of his drafts for EGA on Bertini-type theorems (&quot;EGA&quot; V, published in Ulam Quarterly in 1992–1993 and later made available on the Grothendieck Circle web site in 2004).

In the extensive autobiographical work, &quot;Récoltes et Semailles&quot; (&#x27;Harvests and Sowings&#x27;, 1986), Grothendieck describes his approach to mathematics and his experiences in the mathematical community, a community that initially accepted him in an open and welcoming manner, but which he progressively perceived to be governed by competition and status. He complains about what he saw as the &quot;burial&quot; of his work and betrayal by his former students and colleagues after he had left the community. &quot;Récoltes et Semailles&quot; was finally published in 2022 by Gallimard and, thanks to French science historian Alain Herreman, is also available on the Internet. An English translation by Leila Schneps will be published by MIT Press in 2025. A partial English translation can be found on the Internet. A Japanese translation of the whole book in four volumes was completed by Tsuji Yuichi (1938–2002), a friend of Grothendieck from the &quot;Survivre&quot; period. The first three volumes (corresponding to Parts 0 to III of the book) were published between 1989 and 1993, while the fourth volume (Part IV) was completed and, although unpublished, copies of it as a typed manuscript are circulated. Grothendieck helped with the translation and wrote a preface for it, in which he called Tsuji his &quot;first true collaborator&quot;. Parts of &quot;Récoltes et Semailles&quot; have been translated into Spanish, as well as into a Russian translation that was published in Moscow.

In 1988, Grothendieck declined the Crafoord Prize with an open letter to the media. He wrote that he and other established mathematicians had no need for additional financial support and criticized what he saw as the declining ethics of the scientific community that was characterized by outright scientific theft that he believed had become commonplace and tolerated. The letter also expressed his belief that totally unforeseen events before the end of the century would lead to an unprecedented collapse of civilization. Grothendieck added however that his views were &quot;in no way meant as a criticism of the Royal Academy&#x27;s aims in the administration of its funds&quot; and he added, &quot;I regret the inconvenience that my refusal to accept the Crafoord prize may have caused you and the Royal Academy.&quot;

&quot;La Clef des Songes&quot;, a 315-page manuscript written in 1987, is Grothendieck&#x27;s account of how his consideration of the source of dreams led him to conclude that a deity exists. As part of the notes to this manuscript, Grothendieck described the life and the work of 18 &quot;mutants&quot;, people whom he admired as visionaries far ahead of their time and heralding a new age. The only mathematician on his list was Bernhard Riemann. Influenced by the Catholic mystic Marthe Robin who was claimed to have survived on the Holy Eucharist alone, Grothendieck almost starved himself to death in 1988. His growing preoccupation with spiritual matters was also evident in a letter entitled &quot;Lettre de la Bonne Nouvelle&quot; sent to 250 friends in January 1990. In it, he described his encounters with a deity and announced that a &quot;New Age&quot; would commence on 14 October 1996.

The &quot;Grothendieck Festschrift&quot;, published in 1990, was a three-volume collection of research papers to mark his sixtieth birthday in 1988.

More than 20,000 pages of Grothendieck&#x27;s mathematical and other writings are held at the University of Montpellier and remain unpublished. They have been digitized for preservation and are freely available in open access through the Institut Montpelliérain Alexander Grothendieck portal.

=== Retirement into reclusion and death ===
In 1991, Grothendieck moved to a new address that he did not share with his previous contacts in the mathematical community. Very few people visited him afterward. Local villagers helped sustain him with a more varied diet after he tried to live on a staple of dandelion soup. At some point, Leila Schneps and located him, then carried on a brief correspondence. Thus they became among &quot;the last members of the mathematical establishment to come into contact with him&quot;. After his death, it was revealed that he lived alone in a house in Lasserre, Ariège, a small village at the foot of the Pyrenees.

In January 2010, Grothendieck wrote the letter entitled &quot;Déclaration d&#x27;intention de non-publication&quot; to Luc Illusie, claiming that all materials published in his absence had been published without his permission. He asked that none of his work be reproduced in whole or in part and that copies of this work be removed from libraries. He characterized a website devoted to his work as &quot;an abomination&quot;. His dictate may have been reversed in 2010.

In September 2014, almost totally deaf and blind, he asked a neighbour to buy him a revolver so he could kill himself. On 13 November 2014, aged 86, Grothendieck died in the hospital of Saint-Lizier or Saint-Girons, Ariège.

=== Citizenship ===
Grothendieck was born in Weimar Germany. In 1938, aged ten, he moved to France as a refugee. Records of his nationality were destroyed in the fall of Nazi Germany in 1945 and he did not apply for French citizenship after the war. Thus, he became a stateless person for at least the majority of his working life and he traveled on a Nansen passport. Part of his reluctance to hold French nationality is attributed to not wishing to serve in the French military, particularly due to the Algerian War (1954–62). He eventually applied for French citizenship in the early 1980s, after he was well past the age that would have required him to do military service.

=== Family ===
Grothendieck was very close to his mother, to whom he dedicated his dissertation. She died in 1957 from tuberculosis that she contracted in camps for displaced persons.

He had five children: a son with his landlady during his time in Nancy; three children, Johanna (1959), Alexander (1961), and Mathieu (1965) with his wife Mireille Dufour; and one child with Justine Skalba, with whom he lived in a commune in the early 1970s.

== Mathematical work ==
Grothendieck&#x27;s early mathematical work was in functional analysis. Between 1949 and 1953 he worked on his doctoral thesis in this subject at Nancy, supervised by Jean Dieudonné and Laurent Schwartz. His key contributions include topological tensor products of topological vector spaces, the theory of nuclear spaces as foundational for Schwartz distributions, and the application of Lp spaces in studying linear maps between topological vector spaces. In a few years, he had become a leading authority on this area of functional analysis—to the extent that Dieudonné compares his impact in this field to that of Banach.

It is, however, in algebraic geometry and related fields where Grothendieck did his most important and influential work. From approximately 1955 he started to work on sheaf theory and homological algebra, producing the influential &quot;Tôhoku paper&quot; (&quot;Sur quelques points d&#x27;algèbre homologique&quot;, published in the Tohoku Mathematical Journal in 1957) where he introduced abelian categories and applied their theory to show that sheaf cohomology may be defined as certain derived functors in this context.

Homological methods and sheaf theory had already been introduced in algebraic geometry by Jean-Pierre Serre and others, after sheaves had been defined by Jean Leray. Grothendieck took them to a higher level of abstraction and turned them into a key organising principle of his theory. He shifted attention from the study of individual varieties to his &quot;relative point of view&quot; (pairs of varieties related by a morphism), allowing a broad generalization of many classical theorems. The first major application was the relative version of Serre&#x27;s theorem showing that the cohomology of a coherent sheaf on a complete variety is finite-dimensional; Grothendieck&#x27;s theorem shows that the higher direct images of coherent sheaves under a proper map are coherent; this reduces to Serre&#x27;s theorem over a one-point space.

In 1956, he applied the same thinking to the Riemann–Roch theorem, which recently had been generalized to any dimension by Hirzebruch. The Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem was announced by Grothendieck at the initial Mathematische Arbeitstagung in Bonn, in 1957. It appeared in print in a paper written by Armand Borel with Serre. This result was his first work in algebraic geometry. Grothendieck went on to plan and execute a programme for rebuilding the foundations of algebraic geometry, which at the time were in a state of flux and under discussion in Claude Chevalley&#x27;s seminar. He outlined his programme in his talk at the 1958 International Congress of Mathematicians.

His foundational work on algebraic geometry is at a higher level of abstraction than all prior versions. He adapted the use of non-closed generic points, which led to the theory of schemes. Grothendieck also pioneered the systematic use of nilpotents. As &#x27;functions&#x27; these can take only the value 0, but they carry infinitesimal information, in purely algebraic settings. His &quot;theory of schemes&quot; has become established as the best universal foundation for this field, because of its expressiveness as well as its technical depth. In that setting one can use birational geometry, techniques from number theory, Galois theory, commutative algebra, and close analogues of the methods of algebraic topology, all in an integrated way.

Grothendieck is noted for his mastery of abstract approaches to mathematics and his perfectionism in matters of formulation and presentation. Relatively little of his work after 1960 was published by the conventional route of the learned journal, circulating initially in duplicated volumes of seminar notes; his influence was to a considerable extent personal. His influence spilled over into many other branches of mathematics, for example the contemporary theory of D-modules. Although lauded as &quot;the Einstein of mathematics&quot;, his work also provoked adverse reactions, with many mathematicians seeking out more concrete areas and problems.

===&quot;EGA&quot;, &quot;SGA&quot;, &quot;FGA&quot;===
The bulk of Grothendieck&#x27;s published work is collected in the monumental, yet incomplete, &quot;Éléments de géométrie algébrique&quot; (&quot;EGA&quot;) and &quot;Séminaire de géométrie algébrique&quot; (&quot;SGA&quot;). The collection &quot;Fondements de la Géometrie Algébrique&quot; (&quot;FGA&quot;), which gathers together talks given in the Séminaire Bourbaki, also contains important material.

Grothendieck&#x27;s work includes the invention of the étale and l-adic cohomology theories, which explain an observation made by André Weil that argued for a connection between the topological characteristics of a variety and its diophantine (number theoretic) properties. For example, the number of solutions of an equation over a finite field reflects the topological nature of its solutions over the complex numbers. Weil had realized that to prove such a connection, one needed a new cohomology theory, but neither he nor any other expert saw how to accomplish this until such a theory was expressed by Grothendieck.

This program culminated in the proofs of the Weil conjectures, the last of which was settled by Grothendieck&#x27;s student Pierre Deligne in the early 1970s after Grothendieck had largely withdrawn from mathematics.

=== Major mathematical contributions ===
In Grothendieck&#x27;s retrospective &quot;Récoltes et Semailles&quot;, he identified twelve of his contributions that he believed qualified as &quot;great ideas&quot;. In chronological order, they are:
# Topological tensor products and nuclear spaces
# &quot;Continuous&quot; and &quot;discrete&quot; duality (derived categories, &quot;six operations&quot;)
# Yoga of the Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem K-theory relation with intersection theory
# Schemes
# Topoi
# Étale cohomology and l-adic cohomology
# Motives and the motivic Galois group (Grothendieck ⊗-categories)
# Crystals and crystalline cohomology, yoga of &quot;de Rham coefficients&quot;, &quot;Hodge coefficients&quot;...
# &quot;Topological algebra&quot;: ∞-stacks, derivators; cohomological formalism of topoi as inspiration for a new homotopical algebra
# Tame topology
# Yoga of anabelian algebraic geometry, Galois–Teichmüller theory
# &quot;Schematic&quot; or &quot;arithmetic&quot; point of view for regular polyhedra and regular configurations of all kinds

Here the term &quot;yoga&quot; denotes a kind of &quot;meta-theory&quot; that may be used heuristically; Michel Raynaud writes the other terms &quot;Ariadne&#x27;s thread&quot; and &quot;philosophy&quot; as effective equivalents.

Grothendieck wrote that, of these themes, the largest in scope was topoi, as they synthesized algebraic geometry, topology, and arithmetic. The theme that had been most extensively developed was schemes, which were the framework &quot;par excellence&quot; for eight of the other themes (all but 1, 5, and 12). Grothendieck wrote that the first and last themes, topological tensor products and regular configurations, were of more modest size than the others. Topological tensor products had played the role of a tool rather than of a source of inspiration for further developments; but he expected that regular configurations could not be exhausted within the lifetime of a mathematician who devoted oneself to it. He believed that the deepest themes were motives, anabelian geometry, and Galois–Teichmüller theory.

== Influence ==
Grothendieck is considered by many to be the greatest mathematician of the twentieth century. In an obituary David Mumford and John Tate wrote:
Although mathematics became more and more abstract and general throughout the 20th century, it was Alexander Grothendieck who was the greatest master of this trend. His unique skill was to eliminate all unnecessary hypotheses and burrow into an area so deeply that its inner patterns on the most abstract level revealed themselves–and then, like a magician, show how the solution of old problems fell out in straightforward ways now that their real nature had been revealed.

By the 1970s, Grothendieck&#x27;s work was seen as influential, not only in algebraic geometry and the allied fields of sheaf theory and homological algebra, but influenced logic, in the field of categorical logic.

According to mathematician Ravi Vakil, &quot;Whole fields of mathematics speak the language that he set up. We live in this big structure that he built. We take it for granted—the architect is gone&quot;. In the same article, Colin McLarty said, &quot;Lots of people today live in Grothendieck&#x27;s house, unaware that it&#x27;s Grothendieck&#x27;s house.&quot;

=== Geometry ===
Grothendieck approached algebraic geometry by clarifying the foundations of the field, and by developing mathematical tools intended to prove a number of notable conjectures. Algebraic geometry has traditionally meant the understanding of geometric objects, such as algebraic curves and surfaces, through the study of the algebraic equations for those objects. Properties of algebraic equations are in turn studied using the techniques of ring theory. In this approach, the properties of a geometric object are related to the properties of an associated ring. The space (e.g., real, complex, or projective) in which the object is defined, is extrinsic to the object, while the ring is intrinsic.

Grothendieck laid a new foundation for algebraic geometry by making intrinsic spaces (&quot;spectra&quot;) and associated rings the primary objects of study. To that end, he developed the theory of schemes that informally can be thought of as topological spaces on which a commutative ring is associated to every open subset of the space. Schemes have become the basic objects of study for practitioners of modern algebraic geometry. Their use as a foundation allowed geometry to absorb technical advances from other fields.

His generalization of the classical Riemann–Roch theorem related topological properties of complex algebraic curves to their algebraic structure and now bears his name, being called &quot;the Grothendieck–Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem&quot;. The tools he developed to prove this theorem started the study of algebraic and topological K-theory, which explores the topological properties of objects by associating them with rings. After direct contact with Grothendieck&#x27;s ideas at the Bonn Arbeitstagung, topological K-theory was founded by Michael Atiyah and Friedrich Hirzebruch.

=== Cohomology theories ===
Grothendieck&#x27;s construction of new cohomology theories, which use algebraic techniques to study topological objects, has influenced the development of algebraic number theory, algebraic topology, and representation theory. As part of this project, his creation of topos theory, a category-theoretic generalization of point-set topology, has influenced the fields of set theory and mathematical logic.

The Weil conjectures were formulated in the later 1940s as a set of mathematical problems in arithmetic geometry. They describe properties of analytic invariants, called local zeta functions, of the number of points on an algebraic curve or variety of higher dimension. Grothendieck&#x27;s discovery of the ℓ-adic étale cohomology, the first example of a Weil cohomology theory, opened the way for a proof of the Weil conjectures, ultimately completed in the 1970s by his student Pierre Deligne. Grothendieck&#x27;s large-scale approach has been called a &quot;visionary program&quot;. The ℓ-adic cohomology then became a fundamental tool for number theorists, with applications to the Langlands program.

Grothendieck&#x27;s conjectural theory of motives was intended to be the &quot;ℓ-adic&quot; theory but without the choice of &quot;ℓ&quot;, a prime number. It did not provide the intended route to the Weil conjectures, but has been behind modern developments in algebraic K-theory, motivic homotopy theory, and motivic integration. This theory, Daniel Quillen&#x27;s work, and Grothendieck&#x27;s theory of Chern classes, are considered the background to the theory of algebraic cobordism, another algebraic analogue of topological ideas.

=== Category theory ===
Grothendieck&#x27;s emphasis on the role of universal properties across varied mathematical structures brought category theory into the mainstream as an organizing principle for mathematics in general. Among its uses, category theory creates a common language for describing similar structures and techniques seen in many different mathematical systems. His notion of abelian category is now the basic object of study in homological algebra. The emergence of a separate mathematical discipline of category theory has been attributed to Grothendieck&#x27;s influence, although unintentional.

== In popular culture ==
&quot;Colonel Lágrimas&quot; (&quot;Colonel Tears&quot; in English), a novel by Puerto Rican–Costa Rican writer Carlos Fonseca is about Grothendieck.

The Benjamín Labatut book &quot;When We Cease to Understand the World&quot; dedicates one chapter to the work and life of Grothendieck, introducing his story by reference to the Japanese mathematician Shinichi Mochizuki. The book is a lightly fictionalized account of the world of scientific inquiry and was a finalist for the National Book Award.

In Cormac McCarthy&#x27;s &quot;The Passenger&quot; and its sequel &quot;Stella Maris&quot;, a main character is a student of Grothendieck&#x27;s.

The Istituto Grothendieck has been created in his honor.

<text>Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is a global, peer-led mutual-aid fellowship focused on an abstinence-based recovery model from alcoholism through its spiritually inclined twelve-step program. The organization adheres to Twelve Traditions that emphasize anonymity, the absence of a hierarchical structure, and principles of being free to all, non-promotional, non-professional, unaffiliated, non-denominational, and apolitical. , AA reported a presence in approximately 180 countries with an estimated membership of nearly two million individuals—73% of whom reside in the United States and Canada.

AA traces its origins to a 1935 meeting between Bill Wilson (commonly referred to as Bill W.) and Dr. Bob Smith (Dr. Bob), two individuals seeking to address their shared struggles with alcoholism. Their collaboration, influenced by the Christian revivalist Oxford Group, evolved into a mutual support group that eventually became AA. In 1939, the fellowship published &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism&quot;&quot;,&quot; colloquially known as the &quot;Big Book&quot;. This publication introduced the twelve-step program and provided the basis for the organization&#x27;s name. Later editions of the book expanded its subtitle to reflect the inclusion of &quot;Thousands of Men and Women&quot;.

The Twelve Steps outline a suggested program of ongoing drug rehabilitation and self-improvement. A key component involves seeking alignment or divining with a personally defined concept of &quot;God as we understood Him&quot;. The steps begin with an acknowledgment of powerlessness over alcohol and the unmanageability of life due to alcoholism. Subsequent steps emphasize rigorous honesty, including the completion of a &quot;searching and fearless moral inventory,&quot; acknowledgment of &quot;character defects,&quot; sharing the inventory with a trusted person, making amends to individuals harmed, and engaging in regular prayer or meditation to seek &quot;conscious contact with God&quot; and guidance in following divine will. The final step, the 12th, focuses on maintaining the principles of recovery, sharing the message with other alcoholics, and participating in &quot;12th Step work,&quot; such as peer sponsorship, organizing meetings, and outreach to institutions like hospitals and prisons.

AA meetings differ in format, with variations including personal storytelling, readings from the Big Book, and open discussions. While certain meetings may cater to specific demographic groups, attendance is generally open to anyone with a desire to stop drinking alcohol. The organization is self-supporting through member donations and literature sales. Its operations follow an &quot;inverted pyramid&quot; structure, allowing local groups significant autonomy. AA does not accept external funding or contributions. 

Empirical evidence supports AA&#x27;s efficacy. A 2020 Cochrane review found that manualized AA and Twelve-Step Facilitation (TSF) therapy demonstrated higher rates of continuous abstinence compared to alternative treatments, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, with added healthcare cost savings over time.

Criticism of AA has addressed various aspects of its program and operations. Concerns have been raised about its overall success rate, the perceived religious nature of its approach, and allegations of cult-like elements. Additional critiques include reports of &quot;thirteenth-stepping,&quot; where senior members engage romantically with newer members, and legal challenges related to safety and the religious content of court-mandated participation in AA programs.

==History==
=== Hazard&#x27;s search for treatment, spiritual conversion, &amp; involvement with the Oxford Group ===
Rowland Hazard’s journey from Carl Jung’s psychiatric treatment to spiritual conversion through the Oxford Group played a pivotal role in shaping the foundations of Alcoholics Anonymous, influencing its principles of recovery. In 1926, Hazard went to Zurich, Switzerland, to seek treatment for alcoholism with psychiatrist Carl Jung. When Hazard ended treatment with Jung after about a year, and came back to the US, he soon resumed drinking, and returned to Jung in Zurich for further treatment. Jung told Hazard that his case was nearly hopeless (as with other alcoholics) and that his only hope might be a &quot;spiritual conversion&quot; with a &quot;religious group&quot;.

Back in America, Hazard went to the Oxford Group, whose teachings were eventually the source of such AA concepts as &quot;meetings&quot; and &quot;sharing&quot; (public confession), making &quot;restitution&quot;, &quot;rigorous honesty&quot; and &quot;surrendering one&#x27;s will and life to God&#x27;s care&quot;. He became converted to a lifetime of sobriety while on a train ride from New York to Detroit after reading &quot;For Sinners Only,&quot; by Oxford Group member AJ Russell. Hazard underwent a spiritual conversion&quot; with the help of the Group and began to experience the liberation from drink that he was seeking. Members of the group introduced Hazard to Ebby Thacher, whom Hazard brought to the Calvary Rescue Mission, directed by Oxford Group leader Sam Shoemaker.

=== Bill Wilson &amp; his spiritual awakening ===
In keeping with the Oxford Group teaching that a new convert must win other converts to preserve his own conversion experience, Thacher contacted his old friend Bill Wilson, whom he knew had a drinking problem. Thacher approached Wilson, saying that he had &quot;got religion&quot;, was sober, and that Wilson could do the same if he set aside objections and instead formed a personal idea of God, &quot;another power&quot; or &quot;higher power&quot;.Feeling a &quot;kinship of common suffering&quot;, Wilson attended his first group gathering, although he was drunk. Within days, Wilson admitted himself to the Charles B. Towns Hospital after drinking four beers on the way—the last alcohol he ever drank. Under the care of Dr. William Duncan Silkworth, an early benefactor of AA, Wilson&#x27;s detox included the deliriant belladonna. At the hospital, a despairing Wilson experienced a bright flash of light, which he felt to be God revealing himself.

=== Founding of AA ===

==== Wilson&#x27;s early efforts and influence of the Oxford Group ====
Following his hospital discharge, Wilson joined the Oxford Group and tried to recruit other alcoholics to the group. These early efforts to help others kept him sober, but were ineffective in getting anyone else to join the group. Dr. Silkworth suggested that Wilson place less stress on religion (as required by The Oxford Group) and more on the science of treating alcoholism. Bill W. would later write: &quot;The early AA got its ideas of self-examination, acknowledgment of character defects, restitution for harm done, and working with others straight from the Oxford Group and directly from Sam Shoemaker, their former leader in America, and from nowhere else&quot;. According to Mercadante, however, the AA concept of &quot;powerlessness over alcohol&quot; departs significantly from Oxford Group belief. According to AA, alcoholism cannot be cured, whereas the Oxford Group stressed the possibility of complete victory over sin.

==== Beginnings of AA ====

In 1935, AA began in Akron, Ohio, as the outcome of a meeting between Wilson—who became known as &quot;Bill W.&quot; in AA circles—and Dr. Robert Smith, an Akron surgeon, who would become Wilson&#x27;s first recruitment success. On a business trip by Bill W. to Akron, he was introduced to the surgeon, who despite connections with the Oxford Group, was unable to stay sober. Bill W. explained that alcoholism affects the mind, emotions, and body, a concept he had learned from Dr. Silkworth at Towns Hospital in New York, where he had been a patient multiple times. Convinced by these insights, Dr. Bob took his last alcoholic drink on 10 June 1935 and never drank again, soon achieving sobriety. This date is regarded by AA as its inception. 

Bill W. and Dr. Bob started working with alcoholics at Akron&#x27;s City Hospital. One patient, who soon achieved sobriety, joined them and together, the three men formed the foundation of what would later become known as Alcoholics Anonymous. 

In late 1935, a new group of alcoholics began forming in New York, followed by another in Cleveland in 1939. Over the course of four years, these three initial groups helped around 100 people achieve sobriety. In early 1939, the fellowship published its foundational text, &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot;, which outlined AA’s philosophy; introduced the Twelve Steps; and included the case histories of 30 individuals who had achieved recovery. The Twelve Steps were influenced by the Oxford Group&#x27;s six steps and various readings, including William James&#x27;s &quot;The Varieties of Religious Experience&quot;. This publication marked a significant milestone in AA&#x27;s development.

The first meeting outside the Oxford Group was held at Dr. Bob&#x27;s house with 80 members in attendance. Dr. Bob began the meeting in his dining room by identifying himself as an alcoholic, and placing his foot on the dining room table, read the Sermon on the Mount from the Gospel of Matthew.

The first female member, Florence Rankin, joined AA in March of 1937, and the first non-Protestant member, a Roman Catholic, joined in 1939. The first Black AA group commenced in 1945 in Washington, D.C., founded by Jim S., an African-American physician from Virginia.

=== The Alcoholic Foundation ===

In 1938, Dr. Bob and Bill created The Alcoholic Foundation in New York, bringing in friends of John D. Rockefeller, Jr. as board members. Although they sought to raise significant funds, Rockefeller advised that large contributions might jeopardize the Fellowship. The foundation opened a small office in New York, funded primarily by AA members, to handle inquiries and distribute the Alcoholics Anonymous book. The next year, Rockefeller organized a dinner to promote AA, which further increased the number of inquiries. The office became effective. Each request received a personal reply and a pamphlet, enhancing interest in the book. Consequently, many new AA groups were established, and by the end of 1940, membership had grown to 2,000.

=== Media coverage leads to expansion ===
In 1939, media coverage, particularly from &quot;The Cleveland Plain Dealer&quot;, generated a surge of interest and requests for help. The Cleveland group, although small, successfully assisted many alcoholics, quickly growing from 20 to around 500 members. A subsequent article in &quot;Liberty&quot; magazine resulted in a flood of requests for assistance, further expanding AA&#x27;s reach. In 1941, &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; published an article about AA, sparking a surge in inquires, and AA membership tripled over the next year. AA-related interviews on American radio and favorable articles in US magazines led to increased book sales and membership.

As the growing fellowship faced disputes over structure, purpose, authority, and publicity, Bill W. began promoting the Twelve Traditions. He first introduced his ideas on these in an April 1946 article for &quot;The Grapevine&quot;, titled &quot;Twelve Suggested Points for AA Tradition&quot;, aiming to preserve the organization&#x27;s unity and purpose as AA expanded. He described the input he received as a &quot;welter of exciting and fearsome experience&quot; which greatly influenced the development of the Traditions. From December 1947 to November 1948, &quot;The Grapevine&quot; published the Traditions individually, and in 1950, the First International Convention in Cleveland officially adopted them.

=== Creation of the General Service Conference (GSC) ===
In 1951, AA&#x27;s headquarters in New York expanded its activities, including public relations, support for new groups, services to hospitals and prisons, and cooperation with agencies in the field of alcoholism. It also published standard AA literature and oversaw translations, while the &quot;AA Grapevine&quot; gained substantial circulation. Despite these essential services, they were managed by a disconnected board of trustees, primarily linked to Bill and Dr. Bob.

Recognizing the need for accountability, delegates from across the US and Canada were convened, leading to the first meeting of the AA General Service Conference in 1951. This successful gathering established direct oversight of AA&#x27;s trusteeship by the fellowship itself, ensuring the organization&#x27;s future governance. At the 1955 conference in St. Louis, Missouri, Bill W. relinquished stewardship of AA to the General Service Conference, as AA had grown to millions of members internationally.

=== International expansion ===

The World Service Meeting (WSM), established in 1969, is a biennial international forum at which AA delegates from around the world exchange ideas and experiences about carrying the message of recovery. Held in various cities around the world, the WSM focuses on sharing strategies to help alcoholics in different countries and languages.

Today, AA is present in approximately 180 nations worldwide. By 2018, AA had 2,087,840 members and 120,300 AA groups worldwide. There are AA meetings in Beijing, China.

In July 2024, AA launched its first UK-wide advertising campaign with a unique approach—no logos, phone numbers, or links—focusing on subtle messaging like &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot; and &quot;Alcohol Isn&#x27;t the Answer&quot;. The campaign, created by The Raised Eyebrow Society, aims to attract people struggling with alcohol without violating AA&#x27;s principles of anonymity and non-promotion.

AA will celebrate its 100th anniversary meeting in Indianapolis, Indiana, in 2035. The international convention is anticipated to attract tens of thousands of attendees to the Indiana Convention Center and Lucas Oil Stadium.

==AA literature ==
Alcoholics Anonymous publishes several books, reports, pamphlets, and other media, including a periodical known as the &quot;AA Grapevine&quot;. Two books are used primarily: &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot; (the &quot;Big Book&quot;) and, expounding on the big book in regard to its subject, &quot;Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions.&quot; As with all AA literature, the texts are freely available on AA.org. 

=== The Big Book ===

In 1939, Bill W. and other members wrote the book initially titled &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism&quot;, from which AA drew its name, informally known as the &quot;Big Book&quot;. The second edition of the Big Book was released in 1955, the third in 1976, and the fourth in 2001. The first part of the book, which details the program, has remained largely intact since the 1939 edition, with minor statistical updates and edits. The second part contains personal stories that are updated with every edition to reflect current AA membership, resulting in earlier stories being removed—these were published separately in 2003 in the book &quot;Experience, Strength, and Hope&quot;.

The Big Book suggests a twelve-step program in which members admit that they are powerless over alcohol and need help from a &quot;higher power&quot;. It offers guidance and strength through prayer and meditation from God or a higher power of their own understanding; take a moral inventory with care to include resentments; list and become ready to remove character defects; list and make amends to those harmed; continue to take a moral inventory, pray, meditate, and try to help other alcoholics recover. The second half of the book, &quot;Personal Stories&quot; (subject to additions, removal, and retitling in subsequent editions), is made of AA members&#x27; redemptive autobiographical sketches.

==== Illness and allergy terminology ====
AA&#x27;s Big Book calls alcoholism &quot;an illness which only a spiritual experience will conquer&quot;. Ernest Kurtz says this is &quot;The closest the book Alcoholics Anonymous comes to a definition of alcoholism&quot;. Somewhat divergently in his introduction to The Big Book, non-member and early benefactor William Silkworth said those unable to moderate their drinking suffer from an allergy. In presenting the doctor&#x27;s postulate, AA said &quot;The doctor&#x27;s theory that we have an allergy to alcohol interests us. As laymen, our opinion as to its soundness may, of course, mean little. But as ex-problem drinkers, we can say that his explanation makes good sense. It explains many things for which we cannot otherwise account&quot;. AA later acknowledged that &quot;alcoholism is not a true allergy, the experts now inform us&quot;.

=== &quot;Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions&quot; ===
The &quot;Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions&quot; is a book published in 1953 that serves as a key text for AA. Written by AA co-founder Bill W., it provides detailed explanations of the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions. The book is commonly used in AA meetings and individual study, offering a framework for understanding the organization&#x27;s approach to recovery and community. The story of Eddie Rickenbacker &quot;and his courageous company&quot; appears in the book. It pertains to when his plane crashed in the Pacific and is used in the closing remarks of Tradition One: &quot;Our common welfare should come first; personal recovery depends upon AA unity&quot;.

=== &quot;Grapevine&quot; ===
&quot;The Grapevine&quot;, established in June 1944 by six AA members in New York, became AA&#x27;s national journal by 1945 and later its international journal. Supported by Bill W., the magazine featured first-person stories, AA news, and discussions on key topics like women in AA and veterans returning from war. 

Initially intended as a resource for alcoholics worldwide, the Grapevine evolved into a unifying publication for the AA community, chronicling the Fellowship&#x27;s growth, including the creation of the General Service Structure and publication of later editions of the Big Book. The Twelve Traditions were introduced to AA by Bill W. in April 1946 through an article titled &quot;Twelve Suggested Points for AA Tradition&quot;. The AA Preamble, inspired by the Foreword of the book &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot;, was written by one of the Grapevine&#x27;s early editors Tom. Y. and first appeared in the June 1947 issue. In 1986, it was reaffirmed as AA&#x27;s international journal by the General Service Conference.

==The AA program==
=== Twelve steps ===
AA&#x27;s program extends beyond abstaining from alcohol. Its goal is to effect enough change in the alcoholic&#x27;s thinking &quot;to bring about recovery from alcoholism&quot; through &quot;an entire psychic change,&quot; or spiritual awakening. A spiritual awakening is meant to be achieved by taking the Twelve Steps, and sobriety is furthered by volunteering for AA and regular AA meeting attendance or contact with AA members.

Taking AA&#x27;s 12 steps are a &quot;suggested&quot;, but not required, &quot;program of recovery&quot;—also called a &quot;spiritual solution&quot;. They start with members admitting to being &quot;powerless over alcohol&quot; (which the Big Book calls an &quot;Illness&quot; or &quot;malady&quot;, but never a &quot;disease’’), and out of control—for which on going divining and following the will an unspecified &#x27;higher power&#x27; (&quot;God, as we understood Him&quot;) could restore them to &quot;sanity&quot;. In the steps members acknowledge and make amends and seek to correct personal character defects aided by their higher power for guidance. Those &quot;having achieved a spiritual awakening as a result of these steps&quot; are suggested to carry AA&#x27;s message to other alcoholics. This is often done through meetings of AA groups as well as with members taking on sponsees, although the Big Book makes no mention of the latter term. While taking care to avoid becoming affiliated, some AA members perform outreach to hospitals, treatment centers and correctional facilities. 

==== Sponsorship ====
Members are encouraged to find an experienced fellow alcoholic, called a sponsor, to help them understand and follow the AA program. The sponsor should preferably have experienced all twelve of the steps, be the same sex as the sponsored person, and refrain from imposing personal views on the sponsored person. Following the helper therapy principle, sponsors in AA may benefit from their relationship with their charges, as &quot;helping behaviors&quot; correlate with increased abstinence and lower probabilities of binge drinking.

=== Twelve Traditions ===
The Twelve Traditions provide essential guidelines—not rules—that help AA groups navigate their relationships both internally and with the outside world. These traditions ensure that membership is open to anyone seeking to stop drinking, with no dues or fees required. These Traditions foster an altruistic, unaffiliated, non-coercive, and non-hierarchical organization, limiting AA&#x27;s mission to helping alcoholics at a non-professional level while avoiding publicity. To prioritize recovery, the traditions discourage hierarchies, dogma, public controversies, property acquisition, and outside contributions. Members are advised against using AA for personal gain or public prestige, and anonymity is emphasized, particularly in media, with no prescribed consequences for breaches.

=== Meetings ===

==== Overview ====
AA meetings serve as a space where individuals discuss recovery from alcoholism, with flexibility in how meetings are conducted. While AA offers pamphlets suggesting formats, groups have the autonomy to organize their meetings according to their preferences, as long as their decisions do not impact other groups or AA as a whole. Despite cultural differences influencing certain rituals, many elements of AA meetings remain consistent worldwide.

==== Types ====
AA meetings encompass a variety of formats, each designed to serve different needs. Open meetings are accessible to anyone, including non-alcoholics who can attend as observers. In contrast, closed meetings are reserved for individuals who identify as having a desire to stop drinking, a declaration that cannot be questioned by other members. Speaker meetings feature one or more members who share their personal stories of recovery, fostering connection and understanding among participants.

Big Book meetings focus on reading and discussing passages from AA&#x27;s foundational text, while sharing meetings provide an open platform for members to speak freely and share their experiences, with or without a predetermined topic. AA meetings are gatherings where recovery from alcoholism is discussed. One perspective sees them as &quot;quasi-ritualized therapeutic sessions run by and for, alcoholics&quot;. 

In recent years, online meetings have become popular, allowing members to connect virtually through platforms like Zoom and What&#x27;s App. Offline or in-person meetings, often referred to as &quot;brick and mortar&quot; meetings, take place in physical locations, and some groups even host hybrid meetings, enabling participants to attend either in person or virtually.

==== Inclusivity &amp; language accessibility ====
Inclusivity is a core principle of AA meetings, which welcome all alcoholics, though some are tailored to specific demographics such as gender, age, profession, or cultural background. Since the mid-1970s, several &#x27;agnostic&#x27; or &#x27;no-prayer&#x27; AA groups have begun across the US, Canada, and other parts of the world, which hold meetings that adhere to a tradition allowing alcoholics to freely express their doubts or disbelief that spirituality will help their recovery, and these meetings forgo the use of opening or closing prayers. 

Meetings in the United States are held in a variety of languages including Armenian, English, Farsi, Finnish, French, Japanese, Korean, Russian, and Spanish.

==== Donations and contributions ====
At some point during the meeting a basket is passed around for voluntary contributions. AA&#x27;s 7th tradition requires that groups be &quot;self-supporting, declining outside contributions&quot;.

==== Serenity prayer ====
The Serenity Prayer is commonly used in AA meetings as a tool for reflection and guidance. It was called the AA prayer in the 1940s. Often recited at meetings, it emphasizes the concepts of acceptance, courage, and wisdom, which align with the principles of the AA program. The prayer encourages individuals to accept things they cannot change, to find the courage to make changes where possible, and to seek the wisdom to distinguish between the two. 
=== Sobriety anniversaries and coins ===
Sobriety coins, also known as sobriety chips, are tokens given to members of AA to signify the duration of their sobriety. While the chip system is common, it is not universally adopted across all AA groups. The tradition began with Sister Ignatia in Akron, Ohio who distributed medallions to newly released patients as reminders to avoid drinking. The actual sobriety chip as known today is believed to have originated in 1942 in Indianapolis, gaining popularity as various AA groups adopted the practice. Typically, different colored chips represent milestones of sobriety within the first year, with tokens awarded for 24 hours, 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, and beyond, culminating in a bronze chip for one year of sobriety. 

AA members celebrate Founders Day on the weekend closest to 10 June, marking the anniversary of the organization with thousands of attendees engaging in tours of historical sites, sharing recovery stories, and participating in related activities in Akron, Ohio. 

=== Organization and finances ===

==== Structure and governance ====
AA describes itself as &quot;not organized in the formal or political sense&quot; and has been referred to as a &quot;benign anarchy,&quot; borrowing a phrase from anarchy theorist Peter Kropotkin. The Twelve Traditions guide the functioning of individual AA groups, while the Twelve Concepts for World Service outline how the organization operates on a global scale. Each AA group is self-governing, with AA World Services acting only in an advisory capacity. This &quot;inverted pyramid&quot; style of governance has been key to the organization&#x27;s resilience and adaptability. In Ireland, Shane Butler noted that AA&#x27;s lack of top-level leadership might make it seem unsustainable, but its structure has proven extremely robust since its establishment there in 1946.

AA&#x27;s 21-member Board of Trustees includes seven &quot;nonalcoholic friends of the fellowship,&quot; though the organization is primarily served and run by alcoholics. Members who accept service positions, termed &quot;trusted servants,&quot; hold these roles for limited terms, typically ranging from three months to two years, depending on the position and group vote. This approach ensures regular rotation and participation from a broad spectrum of members, maintaining AA&#x27;s commitment to shared responsibility and leadership.

==== Financial structure ====
AA is entirely self-supporting, relying on voluntary contributions from its members to cover expenses. Contributions to the General Service Office (GSO) are limited to $5,000 per member per year. In addition to these contributions, more than 50% of AA&#x27;s income comes from the sale of AA literature, such as books and pamphlets. This practice aligns with AA&#x27;s Seventh Tradition, which emphasizes financial independence by not accepting donations from outside individuals or organizations. The Central Office is also fully self-supporting through the sale of literature and member contributions.

==== Employment and service roles ====
The Eighth Tradition permits AA to employ &quot;special workers&quot; for roles that require specific expertise or full-time responsibilities, such as administrative tasks. However, these paid roles do not involve working directly with alcoholics in need of help, a function known as the &quot;Twelfth Step&quot;. Calls from alcoholics seeking assistance are always passed on to sober AA members who have volunteered to handle them, ensuring the program remains grounded in its peer-to-peer support model.

==== Organizational operations ====
The AA Central Office coordinates activities such as printing literature, responding to public inquiries, and organizing conferences. It operates independently but ensures alignment with the core principles of the organization. Other International General Service Offices—such as those in Australia, Costa Rica, and Russia—function independently of AA World Services in New York, reflecting AA&#x27;s decentralized and autonomous structure.

=== Hospitals &amp; institutions ===
Many AA meetings take place in treatment facilities. Carrying the message of AA into hospitals was how the co-founders of AA first remained sober. They discovered great value in working with alcoholics who are still suffering, and that even if the alcoholic they were working with did not stay sober, they did. Bill W. wrote, &quot;Practical experience shows that nothing will so much insure immunity from drinking as intensive work with other alcoholics&quot;. Bill Wilson visited Towns Hospital in New York City in an attempt to help the alcoholics who were patients there in 1934. At St. Thomas Hospital in Akron, Ohio, Smith worked with still more alcoholics. In 1939, a New York mental institution, Rockland State Hospital, was one of the first institutions to allow AA hospital groups. Service to corrections and treatment facilities used to be combined until the General Service Conference, in 1977, voted to dissolve its Institutions Committee and form two separate committees, one for treatment facilities, and one for correctional facilities.

In the United States and Canada, AA meetings are held in hundreds of correctional facilities. The AA General Service Office has published a workbook with detailed recommendations for methods of approaching correctional-facility officials with the intent of developing an in-prison AA program. In addition, AA publishes a variety of pamphlets specifically for the incarcerated alcoholic. Additionally, the AA General Service Office provides a pamphlet with guidelines for members working with incarcerated alcoholics.
==Demographics==
=== 2014 membership survey ===
AA&#x27;s New York General Service Office survey of over 6,000 members in Canada and the United States concluded that, in North America, AA members who responded to the survey were 62% male and 38% female. The survey found that 89% of AA members were white. Average member sobriety is slightly under 10 years with 36% sober more than ten years, 13% sober from five to ten years, 24% sober from one to five years, and 27% sober less than one year. Before coming to AA, 63% of members received some type of treatment or counseling, such as medical, psychological, or spiritual. After coming to AA, 59% received outside treatment or counseling. Of those members, 84% said that outside help played an important part in their recovery.

The same survey showed that AA received 32% of its membership from other members, another 32% from treatment facilities, 30% were self-motivated to attend AA, 12% of its membership from court-ordered attendance, and only 1% of AA members decided to join based on information obtained from the Internet. People taking the survey were allowed to select multiple answers for what motivated them to join AA.

=== Diversity ===
A 2024 study found that Black, Hispanic, and younger adults are less likely to attend AA meetings compared to white and older adults, with these disparities remaining consistent over time.

==Effectiveness==

=== Measuring ===
Several metrics are used to evaluate the success of AA including abstinence, reduced drinking intensity, reduced alcohol-related consequences, addiction severity, and healthcare costs. Because of the anonymous and voluntary nature of AA meetings, it has been difficult to perform random trials with them. However, environmental and quasi-experiment studies suggest that AA can help alcoholics make positive changes. Until recently, ethical and operational issues had prevented robust randomized controlled trials from being conducted comparing 12-step programs directly to other approaches. 

=== Reviews and studies ===

==== Long-term recovery effectiveness ====
There have been numerous studies on the effectiveness of AA. A 2006 study by Rudolf H. Moos and Bernice S. Moos saw a 67% success rate 16 years later for the 24.9% of alcoholics who ended up, on their own, undergoing a lot of AA treatment. However, this may be influenced by self-selection bias. Project MATCH, a 1990s multi-site study, found AA to be more effective than no treatment. Other studies link increased AA attendance with higher spirituality and reduced alcohol consumption.

A 2020 Cochrane review concluded that AA is more effective than other treatments, such as MET and CBT, in terms of abstinence rates. It also noted similar success in reducing drinking and alcohol-related problems, though this conclusion was based on moderate-certainty evidence. The review found that AA participation via AA twelve step facilitation (AA/TSF) had sustained remission rates 20-60% above other well-established treatments. Additionally, 4 of the 5 economic studies in the review found that AA/TSF lowered healthcare costs considerably. Nick Heather, an addiction researcher, critiqued the review, arguing it may have a sample bias and that it failed to measure outcomes like quality of life or alcohol dependence, which are important for evaluating recovery.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmidhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16856072/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The authors responded, stating their review showed AA is at least as effective as other treatments and more cost-effective. The authors also noted the lack of quality-of-life measures was due to the limitations of the reviewed studies.

==== Comparative effectiveness and cost effectiveness ====
A 2020 systematic review indicated that manualized AA and Twelve-Step Facilitation (TSF) therapy yields more healthcare cost savings and leads to higher continuous abstinence rates. A longitudinal study suggests that LifeRing and SMART Recovery fared worse than AA across several outcomes, however, the effects are insignificant when controlling for the baseline alcohol goal of total abstinence. More recent studies employing randomized and blinded trials have shown 12-step programs provide similar benefit compared to motivational enhancement therapy (MET) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and were more effective in producing continuous abstinence and remission compared to these approaches.

==== Patterns of engagement and disengagement ====
The 2001–2002 National Epidemiological Survey on Alcoholism and Related Conditions (NESARC) found that 3.4% of respondents had attended a 12-step meeting. Of those, 988 had ceased attending, 348 continued attending, and 105 were newcomers. These figures help to understand engagement and disengagement patterns within AA.

==== Mechanisms of recovery ====
Although AA claims that spirituality is the primary mechanism for achieving change and recovery, there is growing evidence that suggests this is only true for a minority of AA attendees with a high addiction severity. Instead, AA&#x27;s beneficial effects are carried predominantly by social, cognitive and affective mechanisms. However, atheist and agnostic people are less likely to initiate and sustain AA attendance in comparison to spiritual and religious people.

=== Criticism ===
The effectiveness of AA, compared to other methods and treatments, has been challenged over the years. Lance Dodes, in &quot;The Sober Truth&quot;, claims only five to eight percent of the people who go to one or more AA meetings achieve sobriety. Dodes opposes the idea that a social network is needed to overcome substance abuse. Dodes&#x27; assertion that AA is ineffective has been criticized. Some other experts claim that the book&#x27;s conclusion that &quot;[12-step] approaches are almost completely ineffective and even harmful in treating substance use disorders&quot; is wrong. In a 2015 article for &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, Gabrielle Glaser criticized the dominance of AA in the treatment of addiction in the United States, citing Dodes&#x27;s figures and a 2006 Cochrane report, to claim AA had a low success rate. In the past, others have criticized 12-step programs as pseudoscientific Her figures and assertions, however were criticized by other experts.

== Philosophical and sociological dimensions ==
AA shares the view that acceptance of one&#x27;s inherent limitations is critical to finding one&#x27;s proper place among other humans and God. Such ideas are described as &quot;Counter-Enlightenment&quot; because they are contrary to the Enlightenment&#x27;s ideal that humans have the capacity to make their lives and societies a heaven on Earth using their own power and reason. 

After evaluating AA&#x27;s literature and observing AA meetings for sixteen months, sociologists David R. Rudy and Arthur L. Greil found that for an AA member to remain sober, a high level of commitment is necessary. This commitment is facilitated by a change in the member&#x27;s worldview. They argue that to help members stay sober, AA must provide an all-encompassing worldview while creating and sustaining an atmosphere of transcendence in the organization. To be all-encompassing, AA&#x27;s ideology emphasizes tolerance rather than a narrow religious worldview that may make the organization unpalatable to potential members and thereby limit its effectiveness. AA&#x27;s emphasis on the spiritual nature of its program, however, is necessary to institutionalize a feeling of transcendence. A tension results from the risk that the necessity of transcendence, if taken too literally, would compromise AA&#x27;s efforts to maintain a broad appeal. As this tension is an integral part of AA, Rudy and Greil argue that AA is best described as a &quot;quasi-religious organization&quot;.
==Criticism and controversy ==

=== Zoombombing ===
Zoombombing emerged as a significant challenge for AA meetings during the COVID-19 pandemic, when many groups moved online. Disruptive individuals often infiltrated these virtual meetings, harassing participants and sharing inappropriate content. Some AA members experienced racial hatred. This intrusion undermined the safe, supportive environment essential for recovery, raising concerns about privacy and security. In response, AA groups and Zoom implemented stricter access controls and guidelines to protect participants and maintain a welcoming atmosphere for those seeking help.

=== Disease model ===
Though AA usually avoids the term &quot;disease&quot;, 1973 conference-approved literature said &quot;we had the disease of alcoholism&quot;, while &quot;Living Sober&quot;, published in 1975, contains several references to alcoholism as a disease, including a chapter urging the reader to &quot;Remember that alcoholism is an incurable, progressive, fatal disease&quot;. Regardless of official positions, since AA&#x27;s inception, most members have believed alcoholism to be a disease. Its association with AA, as well as a good deal of its broader acceptance, stems from many members propagating it.

Bill Wilson explained in 1960 why AA had refrained from using the term &quot;disease&quot;:

===13th-step and sexual advances ===

&quot;Thirteenth-stepping&quot; is a term used to describe a predatory behavior in AA where some individuals exploit vulnerable members for sexual relationships. This can involve unwanted advances and harassment, often targeting newer members who may be more susceptible due to their recovery status.

In 2003, a study in the &quot;Journal of Addiction Nursing&quot; sampled 55 women in AA and found that 35% of these women had experienced a &quot;pass&quot; and 29% had felt seduced at least once in AA settings. This has also happened with new male members who received guidance from older female AA members pursuing sexual company. The authors suggest that both men and women must be prepared for this behavior or find male or female-only groups. 

==== Response ====
As of 2010, women-only meetings are a very prevalent part of AA culture, and AA has become more welcoming for women. AA&#x27;s pamphlet on sponsorship suggests that men be sponsored by men and women be sponsored by women. AA also has a safety flier which states that &quot;Unwanted sexual advances and predatory behaviors are in conflict with carrying the AA message of recovery&quot;.

===Criticism of culture===
Stanton Peele argued that some AA groups apply the disease model to all problem drinkers, whether or not they are &quot;full-blown&quot; alcoholics. Along with Nancy Shute, Peele has advocated that besides AA, other options should be readily available to those problem drinkers who can manage their drinking with the right treatment. The Big Book says &quot;moderate drinkers&quot; and &quot;a certain type of hard drinker&quot; can stop or moderate their drinking. The Big Book suggests no program for these drinkers, but instead seeks to help drinkers without &quot;power of choice in drink&quot;.

In 1983, a review stated that the AA program&#x27;s focus on admission of having a problem increases deviant stigma and strips members of their previous cultural identity, replacing it with the deviant identity. A 1985 study based on observations of AA meetings warned of detrimental iatrogenic effects of the twelve-step philosophy and concluded that AA uses many methods that are also used by cults. A later review disagreed, stating that AA&#x27;s program bore little resemblance to religious cult practices. In 2014, George Eman Vaillant published a paper making the case that Alcoholics Anonymous is not a cult.

=== Spirituality ===
Some have criticized 12-step programs as &quot;a cult that relies on God as the mechanism of action&quot; and as &quot;overly theistic and outdated&quot;. Others have cited the necessity of a &quot;higher power&quot; (an &quot;HP&quot;) in formal AA as creating dependence on outside factors rather than internal efficacy. Gabrielle Glaser criticized 12-step programs for being &quot;faith-based&quot;, but 12-step programs allow for a very wide diversity of spiritual beliefs, and there are a growing number of secular 12-step meetings.

==== Secular meetings in Toronto controversy ====
Reception to secular 12 step meetings from within AA has been mixed. In 2011, secular meetings in Toronto, where the 12 steps were altered to remove references to God and prayer, were delisted from the Toronto AA online and print directories, effectively removing them from the network of meetings. They appealed this decision, but were rejected, leading to a complaint to the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario. The Toronto co-ordinating body, the Greater Toronto Area Intergroup of Alcoholics Anonymous, argued both that as a special interest group they have the right to restrict its membership, and that a belief in God is a requirement for groups in Toronto. Mediation between the two groups resulted in the delisted groups being listed again, however the secular groups would be required to not alter the 12 steps.

=== Lawsuits and court rulings ===
==== Privileged communication ====
In the Fifth Step, AA members typically reveal their own past misconduct to their sponsors. US courts have not extended the status of privileged communication, such as physician-patient privilege or clergy–penitent privilege, to communications between an AA member and their sponsor.

==== Court rulings on mandatory attendance ====
United States courts have ruled that inmates, parolees, and probationers cannot be ordered to attend AA. Though AA itself was not deemed a religion, it was ruled that it contained &quot;enough&quot; religious components (variously described in &quot;Griffin v. Coughlin&quot; below as, inter alia, &quot;religion&quot;, &quot;religious activity&quot;, &quot;religious exercise&quot;) to make coerced attendance at AA meetings a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the constitution. In 2007, the Ninth Circuit of the US Court of Appeals stated that a parolee who was ordered to attend AA had standing to sue his parole office.

==== Family lawsuit ====
The family of Karla Mendez, who was murdered in 2011 by a man she met at an AA meeting, filed a civil lawsuit in 2012 against AA asserting AA had a &quot;reckless disregard for, and deliberate indifference...to the safety and security of victims attending AA meetings who are repeatedly preyed upon at those meetings by financial, violent, and sexual predators...&quot;. The lawsuit against AA was dismissed in 2016.

==== Big Book manuscript case ====
In May 2017, Alcoholics Anonymous World Services Inc. filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court of the State of New York seeking the return of the original manuscript of the Big Book from its then-owner. AAWS claimed that the manuscript had been given to them as a gift in 1979. This action was criticized by many members of Alcoholics Anonymous since they didn&#x27;t want their parent organization engaged in lawsuits. Alcoholics Anonymous World Services Inc. asked the court to voluntarily discontinue the action in November 2017.

== Notable people who have attended AA ==
While AA emphasizes personal anonymity, many notable individuals have publicly acknowledged their participation in the program for various lengths of time.

Roger Ebert stated he was a member of AA according to a 2009 blog entry he wrote. Eminem has posted pictures of AA Sobriety coins. Anthony Hopkins has credited AA with saving him and marked 48 years of sobriety in 2023. Others who have spoken publicly about their AA attendance include James K. Baxter, Art Carney, Bonnie Raitt, Mychal Judge, Moby, Hank Azaria, Matthew Perry, Jim Irsay, Demi Lovato, Elton John, Tom Waits, Capers Williamson, among others. Some have received pushback, including Brad Pitt recently and criticism from some people in AA regarding its anonymity guidelines.

<doc id="2049" wikidata="Q693457" url="?curid=2049" title="Alpha compositing">
<text>In computer graphics, alpha compositing or alpha blending is the process of combining one image with a background to create the appearance of partial or full transparency. It is often useful to render picture elements (pixels) in separate passes or layers and then combine the resulting 2D images into a single, final image called the composite. Compositing is used extensively in film when combining computer-rendered image elements with live footage. Alpha blending is also used in 2D computer graphics to put rasterized foreground elements over a background.

In order to combine the picture elements of the images correctly, it is necessary to keep an associated &quot;matte&quot; for each element in addition to its color. This matte layer contains the coverage information—the shape of the geometry being drawn—making it possible to distinguish between parts of the image where something was drawn and parts that are empty.

Although the most basic operation of combining two images is to put one over the other, there are many operations, or blend modes, that are used.

== History ==
The concept of an alpha channel was introduced by Alvy Ray Smith and Ed Catmull in the late 1970s at the New York Institute of Technology Computer Graphics Lab. Bruce A. Wallace derived the same straight over operator based on a physical reflectance/transmittance model in 1981. A 1984 paper by Thomas Porter and Tom Duff introduced premultiplied alpha using a geometrical approach.

The use of the term &quot;alpha&quot; is explained by Smith as follows: &quot;We called it that because of the classic linear interpolation formula formula_1 that uses the Greek letter formula_2 (alpha) to control the amount of interpolation between, in this case, two images A and B&quot;. That is, when compositing image A atop image B, the value of formula_2 in the formula is taken directly from A&#x27;s alpha channel.

==Description==
In a 2D image a color combination is stored for each picture element (pixel), often a combination of red, green and blue (RGB). When alpha compositing is in use, each pixel has an additional numeric value stored in its alpha channel, with a value ranging from 0 to 1. A value of 0 means that the pixel is fully transparent and the color in the pixel beneath will show through. A value of 1 means that the pixel is fully opaque.

With the existence of an alpha channel, it is possible to express compositing image operations using a &quot;compositing algebra&quot;. For example, given two images &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, the most common compositing operation is to combine the images so that &quot;A&quot; appears in the foreground and &quot;B&quot; appears in the background. This can be expressed as &quot;A&quot; over &quot;B&quot;. In addition to over, Porter and Duff defined the compositing operators in, held out by (the phrase refers to holdout matting and is usually abbreviated out), atop, and xor (and the reverse operators rover, rin, rout, and ratop) from a consideration of choices in blending the colors of two pixels when their coverage is, conceptually, overlaid orthogonally:

As an example, the over operator can be accomplished by applying the following formula to each pixel:
:formula_4

Here formula_5, formula_6 and formula_7 stand for the color components of the pixels in the result of the &quot;over&quot;, image A, and image B respectively, applied to each color channel (red/green/blue) individually, whereas formula_8, formula_9 and formula_10 are the alpha values of the respective pixels.

The over operator is, in effect, the normal painting operation (see Painter&#x27;s algorithm). The in and out operators are the alpha compositing equivalent of clipping. The two use only the alpha channel of the second image and ignore the color components. In addition, plus defines additive blending.

== Straight versus premultiplied ==
If an alpha channel is used in an image, there are two common representations that are available: straight (unassociated) alpha and premultiplied (associated) alpha.
* With straight alpha, the RGB components represent the color of the object or pixel, disregarding its opacity. This is the method implied by the over operator in the previous section.
* With premultiplied alpha, the RGB components represent the emission of the object or pixel, and the alpha represents the occlusion. The over operator then becomes:
*:formula_11
*:formula_12

=== Comparison ===
The most significant advantage of premultiplied alpha is that it allows for correct blending, interpolation, and filtering. Ordinary interpolation without premultiplied alpha leads to RGB information leaking out of fully transparent (A=0) regions, even though this RGB information is ideally invisible. When interpolating or filtering images with abrupt borders between transparent and opaque regions, this can result in borders of colors that were not visible in the original image. Errors also occur in areas of semitransparency because the RGB components are not correctly weighted, giving incorrectly high weighting to the color of the more transparent (lower alpha) pixels.

Premultiplied alpha may also be used to allow regions of regular alpha blending (e.g. smoke) and regions with additive blending mode (e.g. flame and glitter effects) to be encoded within the same image. This is represented by an RGBA triplet that express emission with no occlusion, such as (0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.0).

Another advantage of premultiplied alpha is performance; in certain situations, it can reduce the number of multiplication operations (e.g. if the image is used many times during later compositing). The Porter–Duff operations have a simple form only in premultiplied alpha. Some rendering pipelines expose a &quot;straight alpha&quot; API surface, but converts them into premultiplied alpha for performance.

One disadvantage of premultiplied alpha is that it can reduce the available relative precision in the RGB values when using integer or fixed-point representation for the color components. This may cause a noticeable loss of quality if the color information is later brightened or if the alpha channel is removed. In practice, this is not usually noticeable because during typical composition operations, such as OVER, the influence of the low-precision color information in low-alpha areas on the final output image (after composition) is correspondingly reduced. This loss of precision also makes premultiplied images easier to compress using certain compression schemes, as they do not record the color variations hidden inside transparent regions, and can allocate fewer bits to encode low-alpha areas. The same “limitations” of lower quantisation bit depths such as 8 bit per channel are also present in imagery without alpha, and this argument is problematic as a result.

=== Examples ===
Assuming that the pixel color is expressed using &quot;straight&quot; (non-premultiplied) RGBA tuples, a pixel value of (0, 0.7, 0, 0.5) implies a pixel that has 70% of the maximum green intensity and 50% opacity. If the color were fully green, its RGBA would be (0, 1, 0, 0.5). However, if this pixel uses premultiplied alpha, all of the RGB values (0, 0.7, 0) are multiplied, or scaled for occlusion, by the alpha value 0.5, which is appended to yield (0, 0.35, 0, 0.5). In this case, the 0.35 value for the G channel actually indicates 70% green emission intensity (with 50% occlusion). A pure green emission would be encoded as (0, 0.5, 0, 0.5). Knowing whether a file uses straight or premultiplied alpha is essential to correctly process or composite it, as a different calculation is required.

Emission with no occlusion cannot be represented in straight alpha. No conversion is available in this case.

== Image formats supporting alpha channels ==
The most popular image formats that support the alpha channel are PNG and TIFF. GIF supports alpha channels, but is considered to be inefficient when it comes to file size. Support for alpha channels is present in some video codecs, such as Animation and Apple ProRes 4444 of the QuickTime format, or in the Techsmith multi-format codec.

The file format BMP generally does not support this channel; however, in different formats such as 32-bit (888–8) or 16-bit (444–4) it is possible to save the alpha channel, although not all systems or programs are able to read it: it is exploited mainly in some video games or particular applications; specific programs have also been created for the creation of these BMPs.

== Gamma correction ==


The RGB values of typical digital images do not directly correspond to the physical light intensities, but are rather compressed by a gamma correction function:

: formula_13

This transformation better utilizes the limited number of bits in the encoded image by choosing formula_14 that better matches the non-linear human perception of luminance.

Accordingly, computer programs that deal with such images must decode the RGB values into a linear space (by undoing the gamma-compression), blend the linear light intensities, and re-apply the gamma compression to the result:

:&quot;formula_15&quot;

When combined with premultiplied alpha, pre-multiplication is done in linear space, prior to gamma compression. This results in the following formula:

:formula_16

Note that the alpha channel may or may not undergo gamma-correction, even when the color channels do.

==Other transparency methods==
Although used for similar purposes, transparent colors and image masks do not permit the smooth blending of the superimposed image pixels with those of the background (only whole image pixels or whole background pixels allowed).

A similar effect can be achieved with a 1-bit alpha channel, as found in the 16-bit RGBA high color mode of the Truevision TGA image file format and related TARGA and AT-Vista/NU-Vista display adapters&#x27; high color graphic mode. This mode devotes 5 bits for every primary RGB color (15-bit RGB) plus a remaining bit as the &quot;alpha channel&quot;.

Dithering can be used to simulate partial occlusion where only 1-bit alpha is available.

For some applications, a single alpha channel is not sufficient: a stained-glass window, for instance, requires a separate transparency channel for each RGB channel to model the red, green and blue transparency separately. More alpha channels can be added for accurate spectral color filtration applications.

Some order-independent transparency methods replace the over operator with a commutative approximation.

<text>In computer science, an array is a data structure consisting of a collection of &quot;elements&quot; (values or variables), of same memory size, each identified by at least one &quot;array index&quot; or &quot;key&quot;. An array is stored such that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula. The simplest type of data structure is a linear array, also called a one-dimensional array.

For example, an array of ten 32-bit (4-byte) integer variables, with indices 0 through 9, may be stored as ten words at memory addresses 2000, 2004, 2008, ..., 2036, (in hexadecimal: codice_1, codice_2, codice_3, ..., codice_4) so that the element with index &quot;i&quot; has the address 2000 + (&quot;i&quot; × 4).
The memory address of the first element of an array is called first address, foundation address, or base address.

Because the mathematical concept of a matrix can be represented as a two-dimensional grid, two-dimensional arrays are also sometimes called &quot;matrices&quot;. In some cases the term &quot;vector&quot; is used in computing to refer to an array, although tuples rather than vectors are the more mathematically correct equivalent. Tables are often implemented in the form of arrays, especially lookup tables; the word &quot;table&quot; is sometimes used as a synonym of array.

Arrays are among the oldest and most important data structures, and are used by almost every program. They are also used to implement many other data structures, such as lists and strings. They effectively exploit the addressing logic of computers. In most modern computers and many external storage devices, the memory is a one-dimensional array of words, whose indices are their addresses. Processors, especially vector processors, are often optimized for array operations.

Arrays are useful mostly because the element indices can be computed at run time. Among other things, this feature allows a single iterative statement to process arbitrarily many elements of an array. For that reason, the elements of an array data structure are required to have the same size and should use the same data representation. The set of valid index tuples and the addresses of the elements (and hence the element addressing formula) are usually, but not always, fixed while the array is in use.

The term &quot;array&quot; may also refer to an array data type, a kind of data type provided by most high-level programming languages that consists of a collection of values or variables that can be selected by one or more indices computed at run-time. Array types are often implemented by array structures; however, in some languages they may be implemented by hash tables, linked lists, search trees, or other data structures.

The term is also used, especially in the description of algorithms, to mean associative array or &quot;abstract array&quot;, a theoretical computer science model (an abstract data type or ADT) intended to capture the essential properties of arrays.

==History==
The first digital computers used machine-language programming to set up and access array structures for data tables, vector and matrix computations, and for many other purposes. John von Neumann wrote the first array-sorting program (merge sort) in 1945, during the building of the first stored-program computer. Array indexing was originally done by self-modifying code, and later using index registers and indirect addressing. Some mainframes designed in the 1960s, such as the Burroughs B5000 and its successors, used memory segmentation to perform index-bounds checking in hardware.

Assembly languages generally have no special support for arrays, other than what the machine itself provides. The earliest high-level programming languages, including FORTRAN (1957), Lisp (1958), COBOL (1960), and ALGOL 60 (1960), had support for multi-dimensional arrays, and so has C (1972). In C++ (1983), class templates exist for multi-dimensional arrays whose dimension is fixed at runtime as well as for runtime-flexible arrays.

==Applications==
Arrays are used to implement mathematical vectors and matrices, as well as other kinds of rectangular tables. Many databases, small and large, consist of (or include) one-dimensional arrays whose elements are records.

Arrays are used to implement other data structures, such as lists, heaps, hash tables, deques, queues, stacks, strings, and VLists. Array-based implementations of other data structures are frequently simple and space-efficient (implicit data structures), requiring little space overhead, but may have poor space complexity, particularly when modified, compared to tree-based data structures (compare a sorted array to a search tree).

One or more large arrays are sometimes used to emulate in-program dynamic memory allocation, particularly memory pool allocation. Historically, this has sometimes been the only way to allocate &quot;dynamic memory&quot; portably.

Arrays can be used to determine partial or complete control flow in programs, as a compact alternative to (otherwise repetitive) multiple codice_5 statements. They are known in this context as control tables and are used in conjunction with a purpose-built interpreter whose control flow is altered according to values contained in the array. The array may contain subroutine pointers (or relative subroutine numbers that can be acted upon by SWITCH statements) that direct the path of the execution.

==Element identifier and addressing formulas==
When data objects are stored in an array, individual objects are selected by an index that is usually a non-negative scalar integer. Indexes are also called subscripts. An index &quot;maps&quot; the array value to a stored object.

There are three ways in which the elements of an array can be indexed:

; 0 (&quot;zero-based indexing&quot;): The first element of the array is indexed by subscript of 0.
; 1 (&quot;one-based indexing&quot;): The first element of the array is indexed by subscript of 1.
; n (&quot;n-based indexing&quot;): The base index of an array can be freely chosen. Usually programming languages allowing &quot;n-based indexing&quot; also allow negative index values and other scalar data types like enumerations, or characters may be used as an array index.

Using zero based indexing is the design choice of many influential programming languages, including C, Java and Lisp. This leads to simpler implementation where the subscript refers to an offset from the starting position of an array, so the first element has an offset of zero.

Arrays can have multiple dimensions, thus it is not uncommon to access an array using multiple indices. For example, a two-dimensional array codice_6 with three rows and four columns might provide access to the element at the 2nd row and 4th column by the expression codice_7 in the case of a zero-based indexing system. Thus two indices are used for a two-dimensional array, three for a three-dimensional array, and &quot;n&quot; for an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional array.

The number of indices needed to specify an element is called the dimension, dimensionality, or rank of the array.

In standard arrays, each index is restricted to a certain range of consecutive integers (or consecutive values of some enumerated type), and the address of an element is computed by a &quot;linear&quot; formula on the indices.

===One-dimensional arrays===

A one-dimensional array (or single dimension array) is a type of linear array. Accessing its elements involves a single subscript which can either represent a row or column index.

As an example consider the C declaration codice_8 which declares a one-dimensional array of ten integers. Here, the array can store ten elements of type codice_9 . This array has indices starting from zero through nine. For example, the expressions codice_10 and codice_11 are the first and last elements respectively.

For a vector with linear addressing, the element with index &quot;i&quot; is located at the address , where &quot;B&quot; is a fixed &quot;base address&quot; and &quot;c&quot; a fixed constant, sometimes called the &quot;address increment&quot; or &quot;stride&quot;.

If the valid element indices begin at 0, the constant &quot;B&quot; is simply the address of the first element of the array. For this reason, the C programming language specifies that array indices always begin at 0; and many programmers will call that element &quot;zeroth&quot; rather than &quot;first&quot;.

However, one can choose the index of the first element by an appropriate choice of the base address &quot;B&quot;. For example, if the array has five elements, indexed 1 through 5, and the base address &quot;B&quot; is replaced by , then the indices of those same elements will be 31 to 35. If the numbering does not start at 0, the constant &quot;B&quot; may not be the address of any element.

===Multidimensional arrays===

For a multidimensional array, the element with indices &quot;i&quot;,&quot;j&quot; would have address &quot;B&quot; + &quot;c&quot; · &quot;i&quot; + &quot;d&quot; · &quot;j&quot;, where the coefficients &quot;c&quot; and &quot;d&quot; are the &quot;row&quot; and &quot;column address increments&quot;, respectively.

More generally, in a &quot;k&quot;-dimensional array, the address of an element with indices &quot;i&quot;1, &quot;i&quot;2, ..., &quot;i&quot;&quot;k&quot; is
: &quot;B&quot; + &quot;c&quot;1 · &quot;i&quot;1 + &quot;c&quot;2 · &quot;i&quot;2 + … + &quot;c&quot;&quot;k&quot; · &quot;i&quot;&quot;k&quot;.

For example: int a[2][3];

This means that array a has 2 rows and 3 columns, and the array is of integer type. Here we can store 6 elements they will be stored linearly but starting from first row linear then continuing with second row. The above array will be stored as a11, a12, a13, a21, a22, a23.

This formula requires only &quot;k&quot; multiplications and &quot;k&quot; additions, for any array that can fit in memory. Moreover, if any coefficient is a fixed power of 2, the multiplication can be replaced by bit shifting.

The coefficients &quot;c&quot;&quot;k&quot; must be chosen so that every valid index tuple maps to the address of a distinct element.

If the minimum legal value for every index is 0, then &quot;B&quot; is the address of the element whose indices are all zero. As in the one-dimensional case, the element indices may be changed by changing the base address &quot;B&quot;. Thus, if a two-dimensional array has rows and columns indexed from 1 to 10 and 1 to 20, respectively, then replacing &quot;B&quot; by will cause them to be renumbered from 0 through 9 and 4 through 23, respectively. Taking advantage of this feature, some languages (like FORTRAN 77) specify that array indices begin at 1, as in mathematical tradition while other languages (like Fortran 90, Pascal and Algol) let the user choose the minimum value for each index.

===Dope vectors===
The addressing formula is completely defined by the dimension &quot;d&quot;, the base address &quot;B&quot;, and the increments &quot;c&quot;1, &quot;c&quot;2, ..., &quot;c&quot;&quot;k&quot;. It is often useful to pack these parameters into a record called the array&#x27;s descriptor, stride vector, or dope vector. The size of each element, and the minimum and maximum values allowed for each index may also be included in the dope vector. The dope vector is a complete handle for the array, and is a convenient way to pass arrays as arguments to procedures. Many useful array slicing operations (such as selecting a sub-array, swapping indices, or reversing the direction of the indices) can be performed very efficiently by manipulating the dope vector.

===Compact layouts===

Often the coefficients are chosen so that the elements occupy a contiguous area of memory. However, that is not necessary. Even if arrays are always created with contiguous elements, some array slicing operations may create non-contiguous sub-arrays from them.
There are two systematic compact layouts for a two-dimensional array. For example, consider the matrix
:formula_1

In the row-major order layout (adopted by C for statically declared arrays), the elements in each row are stored in consecutive positions and all of the elements of a row have a lower address than any of the elements of a consecutive row:

In column-major order (traditionally used by Fortran), the elements in each column are consecutive in memory and all of the elements of a column have a lower address than any of the elements of a consecutive column:

For arrays with three or more indices, &quot;row major order&quot; puts in consecutive positions any two elements whose index tuples differ only by one in the &quot;last&quot; index. &quot;Column major order&quot; is analogous with respect to the &quot;first&quot; index.

In systems which use processor cache or virtual memory, scanning an array is much faster if successive elements are stored in consecutive positions in memory, rather than sparsely scattered. This is known as spatial locality, which is a type of locality of reference. Many algorithms that use multidimensional arrays will scan them in a predictable order. A programmer (or a sophisticated compiler) may use this information to choose between row- or column-major layout for each array. For example, when computing the product &quot;A&quot;·&quot;B&quot; of two matrices, it would be best to have &quot;A&quot; stored in row-major order, and &quot;B&quot; in column-major order.

===Resizing===
Static arrays have a size that is fixed when they are created and consequently do not allow elements to be inserted or removed. However, by allocating a new array and copying the contents of the old array to it, it is possible to effectively implement a &quot;dynamic&quot; version of an array; see dynamic array. If this operation is done infrequently, insertions at the end of the array require only amortized constant time.

Some array data structures do not reallocate storage, but do store a count of the number of elements of the array in use, called the count or size. This effectively makes the array a dynamic array with a fixed maximum size or capacity; Pascal strings are examples of this.

===Non-linear formulas===
More complicated (non-linear) formulas are occasionally used. For a compact two-dimensional triangular array, for instance, the addressing formula is a polynomial of degree 2.

==Efficiency==
Both &quot;store&quot; and &quot;select&quot; take (deterministic worst case) constant time. Arrays take linear (O(&quot;n&quot;)) space in the number of elements &quot;n&quot; that they hold.

In an array with element size &quot;k&quot; and on a machine with a cache line size of B bytes, iterating through an array of &quot;n&quot; elements requires the minimum of ceiling(&quot;nk&quot;/B) cache misses, because its elements occupy contiguous memory locations. This is roughly a factor of B/&quot;k&quot; better than the number of cache misses needed to access &quot;n&quot; elements at random memory locations. As a consequence, sequential iteration over an array is noticeably faster in practice than iteration over many other data structures, a property called locality of reference (this does &quot;not&quot; mean however, that using a perfect hash or trivial hash within the same (local) array, will not be even faster - and achievable in constant time). Libraries provide low-level optimized facilities for copying ranges of memory (such as memcpy) which can be used to move contiguous blocks of array elements significantly faster than can be achieved through individual element access. The speedup of such optimized routines varies by array element size, architecture, and implementation.

Memory-wise, arrays are compact data structures with no per-element overhead. There may be a per-array overhead (e.g., to store index bounds) but this is language-dependent. It can also happen that elements stored in an array require &quot;less&quot; memory than the same elements stored in individual variables, because several array elements can be stored in a single word; such arrays are often called &quot;packed&quot; arrays. An extreme (but commonly used) case is the bit array, where every bit represents a single element. A single octet can thus hold up to 256 different combinations of up to 8 different conditions, in the most compact form.

Array accesses with statically predictable access patterns are a major source of data parallelism.

===Comparison with other data structures===

Dynamic arrays or growable arrays are similar to arrays but add the ability to insert and delete elements; adding and deleting at the end is particularly efficient. However, they reserve linear (Θ(&quot;n&quot;)) additional storage, whereas arrays do not reserve additional storage.

Associative arrays provide a mechanism for array-like functionality without huge storage overheads when the index values are sparse. For example, an array that contains values only at indexes 1 and 2 billion may benefit from using such a structure. Specialized associative arrays with integer keys include Patricia tries, Judy arrays, and van Emde Boas trees.

Balanced trees require O(log &quot;n&quot;) time for indexed access, but also permit inserting or deleting elements in O(log &quot;n&quot;) time, whereas growable arrays require linear (Θ(&quot;n&quot;)) time to insert or delete elements at an arbitrary position.

Linked lists allow constant time removal and insertion in the middle but take linear time for indexed access. Their memory use is typically worse than arrays, but is still linear.
An Iliffe vector is an alternative to a multidimensional array structure. It uses a one-dimensional array of references to arrays of one dimension less. For two dimensions, in particular, this alternative structure would be a vector of pointers to vectors, one for each row(pointer on c or c++). Thus an element in row &quot;i&quot; and column &quot;j&quot; of an array &quot;A&quot; would be accessed by double indexing (&quot;A&quot;[&quot;i&quot;][&quot;j&quot;] in typical notation). This alternative structure allows jagged arrays, where each row may have a different size—or, in general, where the valid range of each index depends on the values of all preceding indices. It also saves one multiplication (by the column address increment) replacing it by a bit shift (to index the vector of row pointers) and one extra memory access (fetching the row address), which may be worthwhile in some architectures.

==Dimension==
The &quot;dimension&quot; of an array is the number of indices needed to select an element. Thus, if the array is seen as a function on a set of possible index combinations, it is the dimension of the space of which its domain is a discrete subset. Thus a one-dimensional array is a list of data, a two-dimensional array is a rectangle of data, a three-dimensional array a block of data, etc.

This should not be confused with the dimension of the set of all matrices with a given domain, that is, the number of elements in the array. For example, an array with 5 rows and 4 columns is two-dimensional, but such matrices form a 20-dimensional space. Similarly, a three-dimensional vector can be represented by a one-dimensional array of size three.

<text>&quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot; is the national anthem of Australia. Written by Scottish-born Australian composer Peter Dodds McCormick, the song was first performed as a patriotic song in Australia in 1878. It replaced &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; as the official national anthem by the Whitlam government in 1974, following an indicative opinion survey. The subsequent Fraser government reinstated &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; as the national anthem in January 1976 alongside three other &quot;national songs&quot;: &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot;, &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot; and &quot;Song of Australia&quot;. Later in 1977 a plebiscite to choose the &quot;national song&quot; preferred &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot;. This was subsequently proclaimed the national anthem in 1984 by the Hawke government. &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; became the royal anthem (later &quot;God Save the King&quot; on the accession of King Charles III), and is used at public engagements attended by the King or members of the royal family.

The lyrics of the 1984 version of &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot; were significantly modified from McCormick&#x27;s original, only retaining a now gender neutral version of the first verse and using a second verse first sung in 1901 at Federation. In January 2021, the official lyrics were changed once again, in recognition of the long habitation of Indigenous Australians. 

==History==
===Origin===

&quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot; was published in early December 1878 by Scottish-born Australian composer Peter Dodds McCormick (1833–1916) under the pen-name &quot;Amicus&quot; (which means in Latin). It was first sung by Andrew Fairfax, accompanied by a concert band conducted by McCormick, at a function of the Highland Society of New South Wales in Sydney on 30 November 1878 (Saint Andrew&#x27;s Day). The song gained in popularity and an amended version was sung by a choir of around 10,000 at the inauguration of the Commonwealth of Australia on 1 January 1901. In 1907, the Australian Government awarded McCormick £100 for his composition.

In a letter to R.B. Fuller dated 1 August 1913, McCormick described the circumstances that inspired him to write &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot; to be sung by a large choir with band accompaniment. McCormick had attended a concert at Sydney&#x27;s Exhibition Building where various national anthems were played.

The earliest known sound recording of &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot; appears in &quot;The Landing of the Australian Troops in Egypt&quot; (), a short commercial recording dramatizing the arrival of Australian troops in Egypt en route to Gallipoli.

Before its adoption as Australia&#x27;s national anthem, &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot; had considerable use elsewhere. For example, Australia&#x27;s national broadcaster, the Australian Broadcasting Commission, used it to announce its radio news bulletins from 1942 to 1952. It was also frequently played at the start or end of official functions. Towards the end of World War II it was one of three songs played in certain picture theatres, along with &quot;God Save the King&quot; and the US national anthem, &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;.

===Adoption by the Whitlam government===

Following the collapse of British power and influence after World War II, Australia was forced to abandon its previous conception of itself as a loyal member of a wider global British community. The impetus for the creation of a new identity was described by Donald Horne as &quot;new nationalism&quot; in 1968. A Gallup poll indicated in 1972 that 72% of Australians now supported a new nationally distinct anthem, up from 38% in 1968. The newly elected Whitlam government of 1972 made central the elevation of distinctively Australian symbols. In this vein, Prime Minister Gough Whitlam announced in his 1973 Australia Day address that

Whitlam also announced that a competition for a new anthem would be held by the Australian Council for the Arts with entrants accepted for both music and lyrics. However, despite around the 2500 entries received for lyrics and 1300 for music, the Council for the Arts could only produce a shortlist of 6 lyrics and no music, reduced from the 12 originally requested. The lyrics selected were &quot;We&#x27;ll Keep the Faith&quot;, &quot;Advance, Australia&quot;, &quot;Song of Australia&quot; and three untitled verses. These were widely denounced by artists and the media, with A D Hope calling them &quot;hopeless&quot;, James McAuley calling them &quot;hopelessly bad&quot; and &quot;The Australian&quot; describing the choices as &quot;between the unbearable and the unforgivable&quot;. One of the judges David Williamson responded to the criticism stating &quot;if you think these are bad, you should have seen the rest of the 2500 or so we rejected&quot;.

Many artists commentated on the difficulty of creating a national anthem in the 1970s, with Richard Meale stating that &quot;we had missed the boat&quot; and writer Bob Ellis stating that &quot;You&#x27;ve got to leave out all the gum trees and wallabies, and you can&#x27;t talk about defending the country against yellow hordes, so there&#x27;s not much to talk about except an independent stance and belated pride in ourselves. Anything else would embarrass the audience.&quot; Ultimately, the government did not include any of the new entries in the final vote, with the poll only including &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot;, &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot; and &quot;The Song of Australia&quot;. This &quot;indicative plebiscite&quot; polled 60,000 people (0.05% of Australians at the time) nationally.

&quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot; was chosen by 51.4% of respondents and, on 9 April 1974, Whitlam announced in parliament that it was the national anthem, to be used on all occasions except those of a specifically regal nature. The choice came under attack almost immediately, with an editorial noting that &quot;For Australians, the only consolation is that there will be very few occasions when the words are sung,&quot; and the Anglican Dean of Sydney commenting &quot;This second-rate secular song is completely inappropriate for use in churches.&quot; Officials in four states said that Advance Australia Fair would not be played at official functions and that &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; would not be replaced, with Sir Harry Budd of New South Wales saying that the lyrics &quot;are foolish and banal and their sentiments ridiculous&quot;.
During the 1975 election campaign following the dismissal of Whitlam by Sir John Kerr, David Combe proposed that the song be played at the start of the Labor Party&#x27;s official campaign launch on 24 November 1975 at Festival Hall, Melbourne. Whitlam&#x27;s speechwriter Graham Freudenberg rejected this idea because, among other reasons, the status of the anthem at that point was still tentative.

=== Reversion by the Fraser government ===
On 22 January 1976 the Fraser government reinstated &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; as the national anthem for use at royal and vice-regal events, but otherwise provided a choice between &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot;, &quot;Song of Australia&quot; or &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot; for civilian functions. The choice of four different national anthems was mocked, with &quot;The Age&quot; declaring the new anthem as &quot;God Save Australia&#x27;s Fair Matilda&quot;. His government made plans to conduct a national poll to find a song for use on ceremonial occasions when it was desired to mark a separate Australian identity, whilst maintaining &quot;God Save The Queen&quot; as the national anthem. This was conducted as a plebiscite to choose the National Song, held as an optional additional question in the 1977 referendum on various issues. Despite both Fraser and Whitlam advocating a vote for &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot;, &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot; was the winner with 43.29% of the vote, defeating the three alternatives, &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot; (28.28%), &quot;The Song of Australia&quot; (9.65%) and the existing national anthem, &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; (18.78%).

=== Re-adoption by the Hawke government ===
&quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot;, with modified lyrics and reduced to two verses (see development of lyrics), was adopted as the Australian national anthem by the Labor government of Bob Hawke, coming into effect on 19 April 1984. At the same time, &quot;God Save the King/Queen&quot; became known as the royal anthem, and continues to be played alongside the Australian national anthem at public engagements in Australia that are attended by the King or any other members of the Royal Family.

Even though any personal copyright of Peter Dodds McCormick&#x27;s original lyrics has expired, as he died in 1916, the Commonwealth of Australia claims copyright on the official lyrics and particular arrangements of music. Non-commercial use of the anthem is permitted without case-by-case permission, but the Commonwealth government requires permission for commercial use.

The orchestral arrangement of &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot; that is now regularly played for Australian victories at international sporting medal ceremonies, and at the openings of major domestic sporting, cultural and community events, is by Tommy Tycho, an immigrant from Hungary. It was commissioned by ABC Music in 1984 and then televised by Channel 10 in 1986 in their Australia Day broadcast, featuring Julie Anthony as the soloist.

==Lyrics==
The lyrics of &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot;, as modified by the National Australia Day Council, were officially adopted in April 1984. The lyrics were updated on 1 January 2021 in an attempt to recognise the legacy of Indigenous Australians, with the word &quot;one&quot; in the second line replacing the previous &quot;young&quot;. The lyrics are now as follows:

&lt;poem style=&quot;float:left; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;I
Australians all let us rejoice,
For we are one and free;
We&#x27;ve golden soil and wealth for toil,
Our home is girt by sea;
Our land abounds in Nature&#x27;s gifts
Of beauty rich and rare;
In history&#x27;s page, let every stage
Advance Australia fair!
In joyful strains then let us sing,
Advance Australia fair!&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem style=&quot;float:left; margin-left: 1em;&gt;II
Beneath our radiant Southern Cross,
We&#x27;ll toil with hearts and hands;
To make this Commonwealth of ours
Renowned of all the lands;
For those who&#x27;ve come across the seas
We&#x27;ve boundless plains to share;
With courage let us all combine
To advance Australia fair.
In joyful strains then let us sing
Advance Australia fair!&lt;/poem&gt;

==Development of lyrics==
Since the original lyrics were written in 1878, there have been several changes, in some cases with the intent of altering the anthem&#x27;s political focus especially in regard to gender neutrality and Indigenous Australians. Some of these have been minor while others have significantly altered the song. The original song was four verses long. For its 1984 adoption as the national anthem, the song was cut from the four verses to two. The first verse was kept largely as the 1878 original, except for the change in the first line from &quot; let us rejoice&quot; to &quot; let us rejoice&quot;. The second, third and fourth verses of the original were dropped, in favour of a modified version of the new third verse which was sung at Federation in 1901.

The lyrics published in the second edition (1879) were as follows:

&lt;poem style=&quot;float:left; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;I
Australia&#x27;s sons let us rejoice,
For we are young and free;
We&#x27;ve golden soil and wealth for toil,
Our home is girt by sea; 
Our land abounds in nature&#x27;s gifts
Of beauty rich and rare;
In history&#x27;s page, let every stage
Advance Australia fair.
In joyful strains let us sing,
Advance, Australia fair.&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem style=&quot;float:left; margin-left: 1em;&gt;II
When gallant Cook from Albion sail&#x27;d,
To trace wide oceans o&#x27;er,
True British courage bore him on,
Til he landed on our shore.
Then here he raised Old England&#x27;s flag,
The standard of the brave;
&quot;With all her faults we love her still&quot;
&quot;Britannia rules the wave.&quot;
In joyful strains then let us sing,
Advance, Australia fair.&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem style=&quot;float:left; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;III
While other nations of the globe
Behold us from afar,
We&#x27;ll rise to high renown and shine
Like our glorious southern star;
From England soil and Fatherland,
Scotia and Erin fair,
Let all combine with heart and hand
To advance Australia fair.
In joyful strains then let us sing
Advance, Australia fair.&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem style=&quot;float:left; margin-left: 1em;&gt;IV
Should foreign foe e&#x27;er sight our coast,
Or dare a foot to land,
We&#x27;ll rouse to arms like sires of yore,
To guard our native strand;
Britannia then shall surely know,
Though oceans roll between,
Her sons in fair Australia&#x27;s land
Still keep their courage green.
In joyful strains then let us sing
Advance Australia fair.&lt;/poem&gt;

The 1901 Federation version of the third verse was originally sung as:

&lt;poem style=&quot;float:left; margin-left: 1em;&gt;III
Beneath our radiant Southern Cross,
We&#x27;ll toil with hearts and hands;
To make our youthful Commonwealth,
Renowned of all the lands;
For loyal sons beyond the seas
We&#x27;ve boundless plains to share;
With courage let us all combine
To advance Australia fair.
In joyful strains then let us sing
Advance Australia fair!&lt;/poem&gt;

The lyrics of &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot;, as modified by the National Australia Day Council and officially adopted on 19 April 1984, were as follows:

&lt;poem style=&quot;float:left; margin-left: 1em;&gt;I
Australians all let us rejoice,
For we are young and free;
We&#x27;ve golden soil and wealth for toil;
Our home is girt by sea;
Our land abounds in nature&#x27;s gifts
Of beauty rich and rare;
In history&#x27;s page, let every stage
Advance Australia Fair.
In joyful strains then let us sing,
Advance Australia Fair.&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem style=&quot;float:left; margin-left: 1em;&gt;II
Beneath our radiant Southern Cross
We&#x27;ll toil with hearts and hands;
To make this Commonwealth of ours
Renowned of all the lands;
For those who&#x27;ve come across the seas
We&#x27;ve boundless plains to share;
With courage let us all combine
To Advance Australia Fair.
In joyful strains then let us sing,
Advance Australia Fair.&lt;/poem&gt;

These lyrics were updated on 1 January 2021 to the current version, in which &quot;young&quot; in the second line is replaced with &quot;one&quot; to reflect the pre-colonial presence of Indigenous Australians, who have lived in Australia much longer than Europeans.

==Criticism==
===General criticism===
In May 1976, after reinstating &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, Fraser advised the Australian Olympic Federation to use &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot; as the national anthem for the forthcoming Montreal Olympic Games. Fraser responded to criticism of &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot; compared with &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot;, and countered, &quot;in the second verse... we find these words, &#x27;Britannia rules the waves&#x27;.&quot; 

The fourth line of the anthem, &quot;our home is girt by sea&quot;, has been criticised for using the so-called archaic word &quot;&quot;. Additionally, the lyrics and melody of the Australian national anthem have been criticised in some quarters as being dull and unendearing to the Australian people. National Party senator Sandy Macdonald said in 2001 that &quot;&#x27;Advance Australia Fair&#x27; is so boring that the nation risks singing itself to sleep, with boring music and words impossible to understand&quot;.

Craig Emerson of the Australian Labor Party has critiqued the anthem, and former MP Peter Slipper has said that Australia should consider another anthem. In 2011, former Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett called for &quot;I Am Australian&quot; to become Australia&#x27;s national anthem, while former Australian Labor Party leader Kim Beazley defended it, stating: the current &quot;National Anthem is not contradictory to an Australian republic&quot;.

===Recognition of Indigenous Australians===
The song has been criticised for failing to represent or acknowledge Australia&#x27;s Indigenous peoples and aspects of the country&#x27;s colonial past, leading to modification. The lyrics have been accused of celebrating British colonisation and perpetuating the concept of &quot;terra nullius;&quot; the now-changed second line of the anthem (&quot;for we are young and free&quot;) was criticised in particular for ignoring the long history of Indigenous Australians. It has also been suggested that the word &quot;fair&quot; celebrates the &quot;civilising&quot; mission of British colonists.

Since about 2015, public debate about the anthem has increased. Boxer Anthony Mundine stated in 2013, 2017 and 2018 that he would not stand for the anthem, prompting organisers not to play it before his fights. In September 2018 a 9-year-old Brisbane girl was disciplined by her school after refusing to stand for the national anthem; her actions were applauded by some public commenters, and criticised by others. In 2019, several National Rugby League football players decided not to sing the anthem before the first match of the State of Origin series and before the Indigenous All-Stars series with New Zealand; NRL coach and celebrated former player Mal Meninga supported the protesting players and called for a referendum on the subject.

Several alternative versions of &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot; have been proposed to address the alleged exclusion of Indigenous Australians. Judith Durham of The Seekers and Mutti Mutti musician Kutcha Edwards released their alternative lyrics in 2009, replacing &quot;for we are young and free&quot; with the opening lines &quot;Australians let us stand as one, upon this sacred land&quot;. In 2015, Aboriginal Australian soprano Deborah Cheetham declined an invitation to sing the anthem at the 2015 AFL grand final after the AFL turned down her request to replace the words &quot;for we are young and free&quot; with &quot;in peace and harmony&quot;. She has advocated for the lyrics being rewritten and endorsed Durham and Edwards&#x27; alternative version.

In 2017 the Recognition in Anthem Project was established and began work on a new version, with lyrics written by poet and former Victorian Supreme Court judge Peter Vickery following consultation with Indigenous communities and others. Vickery&#x27;s proposed lyrics replaced &quot;we are young and free&quot; with &quot;we are one and free&quot; in the first verse, deleted the second and added two new ones; the second verse acknowledging Indigenous history, immigration and calls for unity and respect, and the third adapting lines from the official second verse. It was debuted at the Desert Song Festival in Alice Springs by an Aboriginal choir. Former prime minister Bob Hawke endorsed Vickery&#x27;s alternative lyrics in 2018. In 2017, the federal government under then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull granted permission for Vickery&#x27;s lyrics to be sung at certain occasions as a &quot;patriotic song&quot;, but said that before making any official change to the anthem, &quot;The Government would need to be convinced of a sufficient groundswell of support in the wider community&quot;.

In November 2020, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian proposed changing one word in the opening couplet, from &quot;we are young and free&quot; to &quot;we are one and free&quot;, to acknowledge Australia&#x27;s Indigenous history. The proposal was supported by the federal Minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, and in December 2020 Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that he would be advising the governor-general to proclaim the change, to take effect on 1 January 2021. The new wording was highlighted in the No case of the official referendum pamphlet of the Voice to Parliament referendum to support arguments against purported &quot;divisive&quot; constitutional changes.

==Dharawal lyrics==
Lyrics for the anthem have been written twice in the Dharug language, an Australian Aboriginal language spoken around Sydney by the Dharawal people.

A first version was first performed in July 2010, at a Rugby League State of Origin match in Sydney, though there was some opposition:

In December 2020, another setting, in Dharug, followed by the anthem in English, was sung before a Rugby Union international between Australia and Argentina:

==Other unofficial variants==
In 2011, about fifty different Christian schools from different denominations came under criticism for singing an unofficial version of the song written by the Sri Lankan immigrant Ruth Ponniah in 1988. The song replaced the official second verse of &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot; with lyrics that were Christian in nature.

Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth Peter Garrett and chief executive of the National Australia Day Council Warren Pearson admonished the schools for modifying the lyrics of the anthem, and the Australian Parents Council and the Federation of Parents and Citizens&#x27; Association of NSW called for a ban on the modified song. Stephen O&#x27;Doherty, chief executive of Christian Schools Australia, defended the use of the lyrics in response.

<doc id="2061" wikidata="Q4826583" url="?curid=2061" title="Automatic number announcement circuit">
<text>An automatic number announcement circuit (ANAC) is a component of a central office of a telephone company that provides a service to installation and service technicians to determine the telephone number of a telephone line. The facility has a telephone number that may be called to listen to an automatic announcement that includes the caller&#x27;s telephone number. The ANAC facility is useful primarily during the installation of landline telephones to quickly identify one of multiple wire pairs in a bundle or at a termination point.

== Operation ==
By connecting a test telephone set, a technician calls the local telephone number of the automatic number announcement service. This call is connected to equipment at the central office that uses automatic equipment to announce the telephone number of the line calling in. The main purpose of this system is to allow telephone company technicians to identify the telephone line they are connected to.

Automatic number announcement systems are based on automatic number identification. They are intended for use by phone company technicians, the ANAC system bypasses customer features, such as unlisted numbers, caller ID blocking, and outgoing call blocking. Installers of multi-line business services where outgoing calls from all lines display the company&#x27;s main number on call display can use ANAC to identify a specific line in the system, even if CID displays every line as &quot;line one&quot;.

Most ANAC systems are provider-specific in each wire center, while others are regional or state-/province- or area-code-wide. No official lists of ANAC numbers are published, as telephone companies guard against abuse that would interfere with availability for installers.

==Exchange prefixes for testing==
The North American Numbering Plan reserves the exchange (&quot;central office&quot;) prefixes &quot;958&quot; and &quot;959&quot; for plant testing purposes. Code 959 with three or four additional digits is dedicated for access to office test lines in local exchange carrier and interoffice carrier central offices. The specifications define several test features for line conditions, such as quiet line and busy line, and test tones transmitted to callers. Telephone numbers are assigned for ring back to test the ringer when installing telephone sets, milliwatt tone (a number simply answers with a continuous test tone) and a loop around (which connects a call to another inbound call to the same or another test number).

ANAC services are typically installed in the &quot;958&quot; range, which is intended for communications between central offices. In some area codes, multiple additional prefixes may be reserved for test purposes. Many area codes reserved 999; 320 was also formerly reserved in Bell Canada territory.

Other carrier-specific North American test numbers include 555-XXXX numbers (such as 555–0311 on Rogers Communications in Canada) or vertical service codes, such as *99 on Cablevision/Optimum Voice in the United States. MCI Inc. (United States) provides ANI information by dialing 800-444-4444.

==Telephone numbers==
Plant testing telephone numbers are carrier-specific, there is no comprehensive list of telephone numbers for ANAC services. In some communities, test numbers change relatively often. In others, a major incumbent carrier might assign a single number which provides test functions on its network across an entire numbering plan area, throughout an entire province or state, or system-wide.

Some telecommunication carriers maintain toll-free numbers for ANAC facilities. Some national toll-free numbers provide automatic number identification by speaking the telephone number of the caller, but these are not intended for use in identifying the customer&#x27;s own phone number. They are used for the agent in a call center to confirm the telephone a customer is calling from, so that the customer&#x27;s account information can be displayed as a &quot;screen pop&quot; for the next available customer service representative.

<doc id="2062" wikidata="Q47674" url="?curid=2062" title="Amerigo Vespucci">
<text>Amerigo Vespucci ( , ; 9 March 1454 – 22 February 1512) was an Italian explorer and navigator from the Republic of Florence for whom &quot;America&quot; is named.

Vespucci participated in at least two voyages of the Age of Discovery between 1497 and 1504, first on behalf of Spain (14991500) and then for Portugal (15011502). In 1503 and 1505, two booklets were published under his name containing colourful descriptions of these explorations and other voyages. Both publications were extremely popular and widely read throughout much of Europe. Historians still dispute the authorship and veracity of these accounts, but they were instrumental in raising awareness of the discoveries and enhancing the reputation of Vespucci as an explorer and navigator.

Vespucci claimed to have understood in 1501 that Brazil was part of a fourth continent unknown to Europeans, which he called the &quot;New World&quot;. The claim inspired cartographer Martin Waldseemüller to recognize Vespucci&#x27;s accomplishments in 1507 by applying the Latinized form &quot;America&quot; to a map showing the New World. Other cartographers followed suit, securing the tradition of marking the name &quot;America&quot; on maps of the newly discovered continents.

It is unknown whether Vespucci was ever aware of these honours. In 1505, he was made a subject of Castile by royal decree, and he was appointed to the position of &quot;piloto mayor&quot; (master navigator) for Spain&#x27;s &quot;Casa de Contratación&quot; (House of Trade) in Seville in 1508, a post which he held until his death in 1512.

== Biography ==

Vespucci was born on 9 March 1454 in Florence, a wealthy Italian city-state and a center of Renaissance art and learning, in the suburb of Peretola.

===Family and education===
Amerigo Vespucci was the third son of Nastagio Vespucci, a Florentine notary for the Money-Changers Guild, and Lisa di Giovanni Mini. The family resided in the District of Santa Lucia d&#x27;Ognissanti along with other families of the Vespucci clan. Earlier generations of Vespucci had funded a family chapel in the Ognissanti church, and the nearby Hospital of San Giovanni di Dio was founded by Simone di Piero Vespucci in 1380. Vespucci&#x27;s immediate family was not especially prosperous but they were politically well-connected. Amerigo&#x27;s grandfather, also named Amerigo Vespucci, served a total of 36 years as the chancellor of the Florentine government, known as the &quot;Signoria&quot;; and Nastagio also served in the &quot;Signoria&quot; and in other guild offices. More importantly, the Vespuccis had good relations with Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, the powerful de facto ruler of Florence.

Amerigo&#x27;s two older brothers, Antonio and Girolamo, were sent to the University of Pisa for their education; Antonio followed his father to become a notary, while Girolamo entered the Church and joined the Knights Hospitaller in Rhodes. Amerigo&#x27;s career path seemed less certain; instead of following his brothers to the university, he remained in Florence and was tutored by his uncle, Giorgio Antonio Vespucci, a Dominican friar in the monastery of San Marco. Fortunately for Amerigo, his uncle was one of the most celebrated humanist scholars in Florence at the time and provided him with a broad education in literature, philosophy, rhetoric, and Latin. He was also introduced to geography and astronomy, subjects that played an essential part in his career. Amerigo&#x27;s later writings demonstrated a familiarity with the work of the classic Greek cosmographers, Ptolemy and Strabo, and the more recent work of Florentine astronomer Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli.

===Early career===
In 1478, Guido Antonio Vespucci, Amerigo&#x27;s other uncle, led a Florentine diplomatic mission to Paris and invited his younger cousin, Amerigo Vespucci, to join him. Amerigo&#x27;s role is not clear, but it was likely as an attache or private secretary. Along the way they had business in Bologna, Milan, and Lyon. Their objective in Paris was to obtain French support for Florence&#x27;s war with Naples. Louis XI was noncommittal and the diplomatic mission returned to Florence in 1481 with little to show for their efforts.

After his return from Paris, Amerigo worked for a time with his father and continued his studies in science. In 1482, when his father died, Amerigo went to work for Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de&#x27; Medici, head of a junior branch of the Medici family. Although Amerigo was twelve years older, they had been schoolmates under the tutelage of Giorgio Antonio Vespucci. Amerigo served first as a household manager and then gradually took on increasing responsibilities, handling various business dealings for the family both at home and abroad. Meanwhile, he continued to show an interest in geography, at one point buying an expensive map made by the master cartographer Gabriel de Vallseca.

===Seville===
In 1488, Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco became dissatisfied with his Seville business agent, Tomasso Capponi. He dispatched Vespucci to investigate the situation and provide an assessment of a suggested replacement, Florentine merchant Gianotto Berardi. Vespucci&#x27;s findings have been lost but Capponi returned to Florence around this time and Berardi took over the Medici business in Seville. In addition to managing Medici&#x27;s trade in Seville, Berardi had his own business in African slavery and ship chandlery.

By 1492, Vespucci had settled permanently in Seville. His motivations for leaving Florence are unclear; he continued to transact some business on behalf of his Medici patrons but more and more he became involved with Berardi&#x27;s other activities, most notably his support of Christopher Columbus&#x27;s voyages. Berardi invested half a million &quot;maravedis&quot; in Columbus&#x27;s first voyage, and he won a potentially lucrative contract to provision Columbus&#x27;s large second fleet. However, profits proved to be elusive. In 1495, Berardi signed a contract with the crown to send 12 resupply ships to Hispaniola but then died unexpectedly in December without completing the terms of the contract.

Vespucci was the executor of Berardi&#x27;s will, collecting debts and paying outstanding obligations for the firm. Afterwards he was left owing 140,000 &quot;maravedis&quot;. He continued to provision ships bound for the West Indies, but his opportunities were diminishing; Columbus&#x27;s expeditions were not providing the hoped-for profits, and his patron, Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco Medici, was using other Florentine agents for his business in Seville.

Sometime after he settled in Seville, Vespucci married a Spanish woman, Maria Cerezo. Very little is known about her; Vespucci&#x27;s will refers to her as the daughter of celebrated military leader Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba. Historian Fernández-Armesto speculates that she may have been Gonzalo&#x27;s illegitimate offspring and a connection that would have been very useful to Vespucci. She was an active participant in his business and held power of attorney for Vespucci when he was away.

===Voyages and alleged voyages===
The evidence for Vespucci&#x27;s voyages of exploration consists almost entirely of a handful of letters written by him or attributed to him. Historians have differed sharply on the authorship, accuracy and veracity of these documents. Consequently, opinions also vary widely regarding the number of voyages undertaken, their routes, and Vespucci&#x27;s roles and accomplishments. Starting in the late 1490s Vespucci participated in two voyages to the New World that are relatively well-documented in the historical record. Two others have been alleged but the evidence is more problematic. Traditionally, Vespucci&#x27;s voyages are referred to as the &quot;first&quot; through &quot;fourth&quot;, even by historians who dismiss one or more of the trips.

====Alleged voyage of 14971498====

A letter, addressed to Florentine official Piero Soderini, dated 1504 and published the following year, purports to be an account by Vespucci of a voyage to the New World, departing from Spain on 10 May 1497, and returning on 15 October 1498. This is perhaps the most controversial of Vespucci&#x27;s voyages, as this letter is the only known record of its occurrence, and many historians doubt that it took place as described. Some question the authorship and accuracy of the letter and consider it to be a forgery. Others point to the inconsistencies in the narrative of the voyage, particularly the alleged course, starting near Honduras and proceeding northwest for 870 leagues (about )—a course that would have taken them across Mexico to the Pacific Ocean.

Certain earlier historians, including contemporary Bartolomé de las Casas, suspected that Vespucci incorporated observations from a later voyage into a fictitious account of this supposed first one, so as to gain primacy over Columbus and position himself as the first European explorer to encounter the mainland. Others, including scholar Alberto Magnaghi, have suggested that the Soderini letter was not written by Vespucci at all, but rather by an unknown author who had access to the navigator&#x27;s private letters to Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici about his 1499 and 1501 expeditions to the Americas, which make no mention of a 1497 voyage. The Soderini letter is one of two attributed to Vespucci that were edited and widely circulated during his lifetime.

====Voyage of 14991500====
In 1499, Vespucci joined an expedition licensed by Spain and led by Alonso de Ojeda as fleet commander and Juan de la Cosa as chief navigator. Their intention was to explore the coast of a new landmass found by Columbus on his third voyage and in particular investigate a rich source of pearls that Columbus had reported. Vespucci and his backers financed two of the four ships in the small fleet. His role on the voyage is not clear. Writing later about his experience, Vespucci gave the impression that he had a leadership role, but that is unlikely, due to his inexperience. Instead, he may have served as a commercial representative on behalf of the fleet&#x27;s investors. Years later, Ojeda recalled that &quot;Morigo Vespuche&quot; was one of his pilots on the expedition.

The vessels left Spain on 18 May 1499 and stopped first in the Canary Islands before reaching South America somewhere near present-day Suriname or French Guiana. From there the fleet split up: Ojeda proceeded northwest toward modern Venezuela with two ships, while the other pair headed south with Vespucci aboard. The only record of the southbound journey comes from Vespucci himself. He assumed they were on the coast of Asia and hoped by heading south they would, according to the Greek geographer Ptolemy, round the unidentified &quot;Cape of Cattigara&quot; and reach the Indian Ocean. They passed two huge rivers (the Amazon and the Para) which poured freshwater out to sea. They continued south for another 40 leagues (about ) before encountering a very strong adverse current which they could not overcome. Forced to turn around, the ships headed north, retracing their course to the original landfall. From there Vespucci continued up the South American coast to the Gulf of Paria and along the shore of what is now Venezuela. At some point they may have rejoined Ojeda but the evidence is unclear. In the late summer, they decided to head north for the Spanish colony at Hispaniola in the West Indies to resupply and repair their ships before heading home. After Hispaniola they made a brief slave raid in the Bahamas, capturing 232 Lucayans, and then returned to Spain.

====Voyage of 15011502====
In 1501, Manuel I of Portugal commissioned an expedition to investigate a landmass far to the west in the Atlantic Ocean encountered unexpectedly by a wayward Pedro Álvares Cabral on his voyage around Africa to India. That land would eventually become present-day Brazil. The king wanted to know the extent of this new discovery and determine where it lay in relation to the line established by the Treaty of Tordesillas. Any land that lay to the east of the line could be claimed by Portugal. Vespucci&#x27;s reputation as an explorer and presumed navigator had already reached Portugal, and he was hired by the king to serve as pilot under the command of Gonçalo Coelho.

Coelho&#x27;s fleet of three ships left Lisbon in May 1501. Before crossing the Atlantic they resupplied at Cape Verde, where they encountered Cabral on his way home from his voyage to India. This was the same expedition that had found Brazil on its outward-bound journey the previous year. Coelho left Cape Verde in June, and from this point Vespucci&#x27;s account is the only surviving record of their explorations. On 17 August 1501 the expedition reached Brazil at a latitude of about 6° south. Upon landing it encountered a hostile band of natives who killed and ate one of its crewmen. Sailing south along the coast they found friendlier natives and were able to engage in some minor trading. At 23° S they found a bay which they named Rio de Janeiro because it was 1 January 1502. On 13 February 1502, they left the coast to return home. Vespucci estimated their latitude at 32° S but experts now estimate they were closer to 25° S. Their homeward journey is unclear since Vespucci left a confusing record of astronomical observations and distances travelled.

====Alleged voyage of 15031504====
In 1503, Vespucci may have participated in a second expedition for the Portuguese crown, again exploring the east coast of Brazil. There is evidence that a voyage was led by Coelho at about this time but no independent confirmation that Vespucci took part. The only source for this last voyage is the Soderini letter; but several modern scholars dispute Vespucci&#x27;s authorship of that letter and it is uncertain whether Vespucci undertook this trip. There are also difficulties with the reported dates and details in the account of this voyage.

===Return to Seville===

By early 1505, Vespucci was back in Seville. His reputation as an explorer and navigator continued to grow and his recent service in Portugal did not seem to damage his standing with King Ferdinand. On the contrary, the king was likely interested in learning about the possibility of a western passage to India. In February, he was summoned by the king to consult on matters of navigation. During the next few months he received payments from the crown for his services and in April he was declared by royal proclamation a citizen of Castile and León.

From 1505 until his death in 1512, Vespucci remained in service to the Spanish crown. He continued his work as a chandler, supplying ships bound for the Indies. He was also hired to captain a ship as part of a fleet bound for the &quot;spice islands&quot; but the planned voyage never took place. In March 1508, he was named chief pilot for the &quot;Casa de Contratación&quot; or House of Commerce which served as a central trading house for Spain&#x27;s overseas possessions. He was paid an annual salary of 50,000 &quot;maravedis&quot; with an extra 25,000 for expenses. In his new role, Vespucci was responsible for ensuring that ships&#x27; pilots were adequately trained and licensed before sailing to the New World. He was also charged with compiling a &quot;model map&quot;, the &quot;Padrón Real&quot;, based on input from pilots who were obligated to share what they learned after each voyage.

Vespucci wrote his will in April 1511. He left most of his modest estate, including five household slaves, to his wife. His clothes, books, and navigational equipment were left to his nephew Giovanni Vespucci. He requested to be buried in a Franciscan habit in his wife&#x27;s family tomb. Vespucci died on 22 February 1512.

Upon his death, Vespucci&#x27;s wife was awarded an annual pension of 10,000 &quot;maravedis&quot; to be deducted from the salary of the successor chief pilot. His nephew Giovanni was hired into the &quot;Casa de Contratación&quot; where he spent his subsequent years spying on behalf of the Florentine state.

== Naming of America ==


Vespucci&#x27;s voyages became widely known in Europe after two accounts attributed to him were published between 1503 and 1505. The Soderini letter (1505) came to the attention of a group of humanist scholars studying geography in Saint-Dié, a small French town in the Duchy of Lorraine. Led by Walter Lud, the academy included Matthias Ringmann and Martin Waldseemüller. In 1506, they obtained a French translation of the Soderini letter as well as a Portuguese maritime map that detailed the coast of lands recently discovered in the western Atlantic. They surmised that this was the &quot;new world&quot; or the &quot;antipodes&quot; hypothesized by classical writers. The Soderini letter gave Vespucci credit for discovery of this new continent and implied that the Portuguese map was based on his explorations.

In April 1507, Ringmann and Waldseemüller published their &quot;Introduction to Cosmography&quot; with an accompanying world map. The &quot;Introduction&quot; was written in Latin and included a Latin translation of the Soderini letter. In a preface to the &quot;Letter&quot;, Ringmann wrote 
A thousand copies of the world map were printed with the title &quot;Universal Geography According to the Tradition of Ptolemy and the Contributions of Amerigo Vespucci and Others&quot;. It was decorated with prominent portraits of Ptolemy and Vespucci and, for the first time, the name America was applied to a map of the New World.

The &quot;Introduction&quot; and map were a great success and four editions were printed in the first year alone. The map was widely used in universities and was influential among cartographers who admired the craftsmanship that went into its creation. In the following years, other maps were printed that often incorporated the name America. In 1538, Gerardus Mercator used America to name both the North and South continents on his influential map. By this point the tradition of marking the name &quot;America&quot; on maps of the New World was secure.

In 1513 Waldseemüller published a new map with the New World labelled &quot;Terra Incognita&quot; instead of &quot;America&quot;, and the accompanying text names Columbus as discoverer. Many supporters of Columbus felt that Vespucci had stolen an honour that rightfully belonged to Columbus. Most historians now believe that Vespucci was unaware of Waldseemüller&#x27;s map before his death in 1512 and many assert that he was not even the author of the Soderini letter.

== Vespucci letters ==

Knowledge of Vespucci&#x27;s voyages relies almost entirely on a handful of letters written by him or attributed to him. Two of these letters were published during his lifetime and received widespread attention throughout Europe. Several scholars now believe that Vespucci did not write the two published letters in the form in which they circulated during his lifetime. They suggest that they were fabrications based in part on genuine Vespucci letters.

:&quot;Mundus Novus&quot; (1503) was a letter written to Vespucci&#x27;s former schoolmate and one-time patron, Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de&#x27; Medici. Originally published in Latin, the letter described his voyage to Brazil in 15011502 serving under the Portuguese flag. The document proved to be extremely popular throughout Europe. Within a year of publication, twelve editions were printed including translations into Italian, French, German, Dutch and other languages. By 1550, at least 50 editions had been issued. 

:Letter to Soderini (1505) was a letter ostensibly intended for Piero di Tommaso Soderini, the leader of the Florentine Republic. It was written in Italian and published in Florence around 1505. It is more sensational in tone than the other letters and the only one to assert that Vespucci made four voyages of exploration. The authorship and the veracity of the letter have been widely questioned by modern historians. Nevertheless, this document was the original inspiration for naming the American continent in honour of Amerigo Vespucci.

The remaining documents were unpublished manuscripts; handwritten letters uncovered by researchers more than 250 years after Vespucci&#x27;s death. After years of controversy, the authenticity of the three complete letters was convincingly demonstrated by Alberto Magnaghi in 1924. Most historians now accept them as the work of Vespucci but aspects of the accounts are still disputed.

:Letter from Seville (1500) describes a voyage made in 14991500 while in the service of Spain. It was first published in 1745 by Angelo Maria Bandini.

:Letter from Cape Verde (1501) was written in Cape Verde at the outset of a voyage undertaken for Portugal in 15011502. It was first published by Count Baldelli Boni in 1807. It describes the first leg of the journey from Lisbon to Cape Verde and provides details about Pedro Cabral&#x27;s voyage to India which were obtained when the two fleets met by chance while anchored in the harbour at Cape Verde.

:Letter from Lisbon (1502) is essentially a continuation of the letter started in Cape Verde. It describes the remainder of a voyage made on behalf of Portugal in 15011502. The letter was first published by Francesco Bartolozzi in 1789.

:Ridolfi Fragment (1502) is part of a letter attributed to Vespucci but some of its assertions remain controversial. It was first published in 1937 by Roberto Ridolfi. The letter appears to be an argumentative response to questions or objections raised by the unknown recipient. A reference is made to three voyages made by Vespucci, two on behalf of Spain and one for Portugal.

== Historiography ==

Vespucci has been called &quot;the most enigmatic and controversial figure in early American history&quot;. The debate has become known among historians as the &quot;Vespucci question&quot;. How many voyages did he make? What was his role on the voyages and what did he learn? The evidence relies almost entirely on a handful of letters attributed to him. Many historians have analysed these documents and have arrived at contradictory conclusions.

In 1515, Sebastian Cabot became one of the first to question Vespucci&#x27;s accomplishments and express doubts about his 1497 voyage. Later, Bartolomé de las Casas argued that Vespucci was a liar and stole the credit that was due Columbus. By 1600, most regarded Vespucci as an impostor and not worthy of his honours and fame. In 1839, Alexander von Humboldt after careful consideration asserted the 1497 voyage was impossible but accepted the two Portuguese-sponsored voyages. Humboldt also called into question the assertion that Vespucci recognized that he had encountered a new continent. According to Humboldt, Vespucci (and Columbus) died in the belief that they had reached the eastern edge of Asia. Vespucci&#x27;s reputation was perhaps at its lowest in 1856 when Ralph Waldo Emerson called Vespucci a &quot;thief&quot; and &quot;pickle dealer&quot; from Seville who managed to get &quot;half the world baptized with his dishonest name&quot;.

Opinions began to shift somewhat after 1857 when Brazilian historian Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen wrote that everything in the Soderini letter was true. Other historians followed in support of Vespucci including John Fiske and Henry Harrisse.

In 1924, Alberto Magnaghi published the results of his exhaustive review of Vespucci&#x27;s writings and relevant cartography. He denied Vespucci&#x27;s authorship of the 1503 &quot;Mundus Novus&quot; and the 1505 Letter to Soderini, the only two texts published during his lifetime. He suggested that the Soderini letter was not written by Vespucci, but was cobbled together by unscrupulous Florentine publishers who combined several accounts – some from Vespucci, others from elsewhere. Magnaghi determined that the manuscript letters were authentic and based on them he was the first to propose that only the second and third voyages were true, and the first and fourth voyages (only found in the Soderini letter) were fabrications. While Magnaghi has been one of the chief proponents of a two-voyage narrative, Roberto Levellier was an influential Argentinian historian who endorsed the authenticity of all Vespucci&#x27;s letters and proposed the most extensive itinerary for his four voyages.

Other modern historians and popular writers have taken varying positions on Vespucci&#x27;s letters and voyages, espousing two, three, or four voyages and supporting or denying the authenticity of his two printed letters. Most authors believe that the three manuscript letters are authentic while the first voyage as described in the Soderini letter draws the most criticism and disbelief.

A two-voyage thesis was accepted and popularized by Frederick J. Pohl (1944), and rejected by Germán Arciniegas (1955), who posited that all four voyages were truthful. Luciano Formisiano (1992) also rejects the Magnaghi thesis (acknowledging that publishers probably tampered with Vespucci&#x27;s writings) and declares all four voyages genuine, but differs from Arciniegas in details (particularly the first voyage). Samuel Morison (1974) flatly rejected the first voyage but was noncommittal about the two published letters. Felipe Fernández-Armesto (2007) calls the authenticity question &quot;inconclusive&quot; and hypothesizes that the first voyage was probably another version of the second; the third is unassailable, and the fourth is probably true.

==Legacy==

Vespucci&#x27;s historical importance may rest more with his letters (whether or not he wrote them all) than his discoveries. Burckhardt cites the naming of America after him as an example of the immense role of the Italian literature of the time in determining historical memory. Within a few years of the publication of his two letters, the European public became aware of the newly discovered continents of the Americas. According to Vespucci:

<text>Aristide Joseph Bonaventure Maillol (; December 8, 1861 – September 27, 1944) was a French sculptor, painter, and printmaker.

He began his career as a painter and developed an early interest in the decorative arts. He became primarily interested in sculpture from his early 40s. Maillol was one of the most famous sculptors of his time. His work inspired artists such as Picasso, Henri Matisse and Henry Moore.

==Biography==

Maillol was born in Banyuls-sur-Mer, Roussillon. He decided at an early age to become a painter, and moved to Paris in 1881 to study art. After several applications and several years of living in poverty, his enrollment in the École des Beaux-Arts was accepted in 1885, and he studied there under Jean-Léon Gérôme and Alexandre Cabanel. His early paintings show the influence of his contemporaries Pierre Puvis de Chavannes and Paul Gauguin.

Gauguin encouraged his growing interest in decorative art, an interest that led Maillol to take up tapestry design. In 1893 Maillol opened a tapestry workshop in Banyuls, producing works whose high technical and aesthetic quality gained him recognition for renewing this art form in France. He began making small terracotta sculptures in 1895, and within a few years his concentration on sculpture led to the abandonment of his work in tapestry.

In July 1896, Maillol married Clotilde Narcis, one of his employees at his tapestry workshop. Their only son, Lucian, was born that October.

Maillol&#x27;s first major sculpture, &quot;A Seated Woman&quot;, was modeled after his wife. The first version (in the Museum of Modern Art, New York) was completed in 1902, and renamed &quot;La Méditerranée&quot;. Maillol, believing that &quot;art does not lie in the copying of nature&quot;, produced a second, less naturalistic version in 1905. In 1902, the art dealer Ambroise Vollard provided Maillol with his first exhibition.
The subject of nearly all of Maillol&#x27;s mature work is the female body, treated with a classical emphasis on stable forms. The figurative style of his large bronzes is perceived as an important precursor to the greater simplifications of Henry Moore, and his serene classicism set a standard for European (and American) figure sculpture until the end of World War II.

Josep Pla said of Maillol, &quot;These archaic ideas, Greek, were the great novelty Maillol brought into the tendency of modern sculpture. What you need to love from the ancients is not the antiquity, it is the sense of permanent, renewed novelty, that is due to the nature and reason.&quot;

His important public commissions include a 1912 commission for a monument to Cézanne, as well as numerous war memorials commissioned after World War I.

Maillol served as a juror with Florence Meyer Blumenthal in awarding the Prix Blumenthal (1919–1954) a grant awarded to painters, sculptors, decorators, engravers, writers, and musicians.

He made a series of woodcut illustrations for an edition of Vergil&#x27;s &quot;Eclogues&quot; published by Harry Graf Kessler in 1926–27. He also illustrated &quot;Daphnis and Chloe&quot; by Longus (1937) and &quot;Chansons pour elle&quot; by Paul Verlaine (1939).

He died in Banyuls at the age of eighty-two, in an automobile accident. While driving home during a thunderstorm, the car in which he was a passenger skidded off the road and rolled over. A large collection of Maillol&#x27;s work is maintained at the Musée Maillol in Paris, which was established by Dina Vierny, Maillol&#x27;s model and platonic companion during the last 10 years of his life. His home a few kilometers outside Banyuls, also the site of his final resting place, has been turned into a museum, the Musée Maillol Banyuls-sur-Mer, where a number of his works and sketches are displayed.

Three of his bronzes grace the grand staircase of the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City: &quot;Summer&quot; (1910–11), &quot;Venus Without Arms&quot; (1920), and&quot; Kneeling Woman: Monument to Debussy&quot; (1950–55). The third, the artist&#x27;s only reference to music, is a copy of an original created for the French city of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Claude Debussy&#x27;s birthplace.

== Nazi-looted art ==
During the German occupation of France, dozens of artworks by Maillol were seized by the Nazi looting organization known as the E.R.R. or Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce. The Database of Art Objects at the Jeu de Paume lists thirty artworks by Maillol. The German Lost Art Foundation database lists 33 entries for Maillol. The German Historical Museum&#x27;s database for artworks recovered by the Allies at the Munich Central Collecting Point has 13 items related to Maillol. Maillol&#x27;s sculpture &quot;Head of Flora&quot; was found in the stash of Cornelius Gurlitt, son of Hitler&#x27;s art dealer Hildebrand Gurlitt together with lithographs, drawings and paintings.

A photograph from May 24, 1946, shows &quot;Six men, members of the Monuments, Fine Arts &amp; Archives section of the military, prepare Aristide Maillol&#x27;s sculpture &quot;Baigneuse à la draperie&quot;, looted during World War II for transport to France. Sculpture is labeled with sign: Wiesbaden, no. 31.&quot;

Jewish art collectors whose artworks by Maillol were looted by Nazis include Hugo Simon, Alfred Flechtheim and many others.

== Legacy and Contemporary Influence ==
Aristide Maillol&#x27;s work has had a profound and enduring impact on both modern and contemporary art, particularly within the realms of sculpture, the representation of the human body, and the revival of classical forms in the 20th century. His restrained, monumental approach to the female figure influenced numerous artists, sparking discussions about form, abstraction, and the essence of sculpture itself.

One of Maillol&#x27;s most significant contributions was his rejection of the exaggerated dynamism that characterized much of late 19th-century sculpture, notably the work of his contemporary, Auguste Rodin. Maillol&#x27;s figures, with their serene and stable forms, marked a return to classical simplicity and purity. This approach resonated with artists like Henry Moore, who cited Maillol as an early influence on his own move toward abstraction and monumentality. Moore admired the way Maillol&#x27;s work avoided excessive detail, allowing the essential form of the human body to take precedence. In his 1941 writings, Moore stated, &quot;Maillol&#x27;s influence was important to me because of the calm and permanence that his figures suggest, as well as his return to classical balance and volume.&quot; &lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Hans Arp, a Dadaist and Surrealist artist, found inspiration in Maillol&#x27;s organic forms, which he believed offered a “timeless universality.” Arp&#x27;s abstracted, rounded sculptures share a kinship with Maillol&#x27;s pursuit of essential, elemental forms, though Arp pushed these ideas further into abstraction.

Art historians such as Hilton Kramer and Albert Elsen have extensively discussed Maillol&#x27;s unique place in modern sculpture. Kramer remarked that Maillol&#x27;s works possess an &quot;elemental calm&quot; and reflect an anti-Romantic sentiment, contrasting sharply with the emotional intensity of Rodin. Elsen, in his study of Maillol&#x27;s work, argued that his influence can be seen in the development of modernist sculpture, particularly through his focus on the essential harmony of form and space, a concept that paved the way for mid-century minimalism.

In more recent decades, Maillol&#x27;s sculptures have continued to inspire contemporary artists exploring themes of memory, identity, and the body. The French-Lebanese contemporary artist Oliver Aoun incorporated Maillol&#x27;s sculptures into his project &quot;Lisa Rediviva&quot; (2012), which juxtaposes classical representations of the female form with fragmented images of the Mona Lisa. Aoun&#x27;s work engaged with the legacy of Western iconography, questioning the colonial and patriarchal structures embedded within these revered forms. In reinterpreting Maillol&#x27;s figures, Oliver Aoun critiqued the traditional Western gaze and proposed a more inclusive dialogue around the representation of women in art.

Furthermore, exhibitions such as the 2011 show at the Musée Maillol in Paris, which focused on the dialogue between Maillol and contemporary sculptors, underscore the relevance of his oeuvre in ongoing conversations about the body, space, and abstraction. Artists such as Jean-Michel Othoniel and Louise Bourgeois have also been said to engage with the themes of solidity and fluidity in ways that echo Maillol&#x27;s approach to form.

Maillol&#x27;s influence persists not only in sculpture but also in broader conversations about the role of classical ideals in contemporary art, inviting ongoing re-evaluation and reinterpretation.

<text>Antonio Canova (; 1 November 1757 – 13 October 1822) was an Italian Neoclassical sculptor, famous for his marble sculptures. Often regarded as the greatest of the Neoclassical artists, his sculpture was inspired by the Baroque and the classical revival, and has been characterised as having avoided the melodramatics of the former, and the cold artificiality of the latter.

==Life==

===Possagno===

In 1757, Antonio Canova was born in the Venetian Republic city of Possagno to Pietro Canova, a stonecutter, and Angela Zardo Fantolin. In 1761, his father died. A year later, his mother remarried. As such, in 1762, he was put into the care of his paternal grandfather Pasino Canova, who was a stonemason, owner of a quarry, and was a &quot;sculptor who specialized in altars with statues and low reliefs in late Baroque style&quot;. He led Antonio into the art of sculpting.

Before the age of ten, Canova began making models in clay, and carving marble. Indeed, at the age of nine, he executed two small shrines of Carrara marble, which are still extant. After these works, he appears to have been constantly employed under his grandfather.

===Venice===
In 1770, he was an apprentice for two years to Giuseppe Bernardi, who was also known as &#x27;Torretto&#x27;. Afterwards, he was under the tutelage of Giovanni Ferrari until he began his studies at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia. At the academy, he won several prizes. During this time, he was given his first workshop within a monastery by some local monks.

The Senator Giovanni Falier commissioned Canova to produce statues of Orpheus and Eurydice for his garden – the Villa Falier at Asolo. The statues were begun in 1775, and both were completed by 1777. The pieces exemplify the late Rococo style. On the year of their completion, both works were exhibited for the Feast of the Ascension in Piazza San Marco. Widely praised, the works won Canova his first renown among the Venetian elite. Another Venetian who is said to have commissioned early works from Canova was the abate Filippo Farsetti, whose collection at Ca&#x27; Farsetti on the Grand Canal he frequented.

In 1779, Canova opened his own studio at Calle Del Traghetto at S. Maurizio. At this time, Procurator Pietro Vettor Pisani commissioned Canova&#x27;s first marble statue: a depiction of Daedalus and Icarus. The statue inspired great admiration for his work at the annual art fair; Canova was paid 100 gold zecchini for the completed work. At the base of the statue, Daedalus&#x27; tools are scattered about; these tools are also an allusion to Sculpture, of which the statue is a personification. With such an intention, there is suggestion that Daedalus is a portrait of Canova&#x27;s grandfather Pasino.

===Rome===
Canova arrived in Rome, on 28 December 1780. Prior to his departure, his friends had applied to the Venetian Senate for a pension. Successful in the application, the stipend allotted amounted to three hundred ducats, limited to three years.

While in Rome, Canova spent time studying and sketching the works of Michelangelo.

In 1781, Girolamo Zulian – the Venetian ambassador to Rome – hired Canova to sculpt &quot;Theseus and the Minotaur&quot;. Zulian played a fundamental role in Canova&#x27;s rise to fame, turning some rooms of his palace into a studio for the artist and placing his trust in him despite Canova&#x27;s early critics in Rome. The statue depicts the victorious Theseus seated on the lifeless body of a Minotaur. The initial spectators were certain that the work was a copy of a Greek original, and were shocked to learn it was a contemporary work. The highly regarded work is now in the collection of the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, in London.

Between 1783 and 1785, Canova arranged, composed, and designed a funerary monument dedicated to Clement XIV for the Church of Santi Apostoli. After another two years, the work met completion in 1787. The monument secured Canova&#x27;s reputation as the pre-eminent living artist.

In 1792, he completed another cenotaph, this time commemorating Clement XIII for St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. Canova harmonized its design with the older Baroque funerary monuments in the basilica.

In 1790, he began to work on a funerary monument for Titian, which was eventually abandoned by 1795. During the same year, he increased his activity as a painter. Canova was notoriously disinclined to restore sculptures. However, in 1794 he made an exception for his friend and early patron Zulian, restoring a few sculptures that Zulian had moved from Rome to Venice.

The following decade was extremely productive, beginning works such as &quot;Hercules and Lichas&quot;, &quot;Cupid and Psyche&quot;, &quot;Hebe&quot;, &quot;Tomb of Duchess Maria Christina of Saxony-Teschen&quot;, and &quot;The Penitent Magdalene&quot;.

In 1797, he went to Vienna, but only a year later, in 1798, he returned to Possagno for a year.

===France and England===
By 1800, Canova was the most celebrated artist in Europe. He systematically promoted his reputation by publishing engravings of his works and having marble versions of plaster casts made in his workshop. He became so successful that he had acquired patrons from across Europe including France, England, Russia, Austria and Holland, as well as several members from different royal lineages, and prominent individuals. Among his patrons were Napoleon and his family, for whom Canova produced much work, including several depictions between 1803 and 1809. The most notable representations were that of &quot;Napoleon as Mars the Peacemaker&quot;, and &quot;Venus Victrix&quot; which was portrayal of Pauline Bonaparte.

&quot;Napoleon as Mars the Peacemaker&quot; had its inception after Canova was hired to make a bust of Napoleon in 1802. The statue was begun in 1803, with Napoleon requesting to be shown in a French General&#x27;s uniform, Canova rejected this, insisting on an allusion to Mars, the Roman god of War. It was completed in 1806. In 1811, the statue arrived in Paris, but not installed; neither was its bronze copy in the Foro Napoleonico in Milan. In 1815, the original went to the Duke of Wellington, after his victory at Waterloo against Napoleon.


&quot;Venus Victrix&quot; was originally conceived as a robed and recumbent sculpture of Pauline Borghese in the guise of Diana. Instead, Pauline ordered Canova to make the statue a nude Venus. The work was not intended for public viewing.

Other works for the Napoleon family include, a bust of Napoleon, a statue of Napoleon&#x27;s mother, and Marie Louise as Concordia.

In 1802, Canova was assigned the post of &#x27;Inspector-General of Antiquities and Fine Art of the Papal State&#x27;, a position formerly held by Raphael. One of his activities in this capacity was to pioneer the restoration of the Appian Way by restoring the tomb of Servilius Quartus. In 1808 Canova became an associated member of the Royal Institute of Sciences, Literature and Fine Arts of the Kingdom of Holland.

In 1814, he began his &quot;The Three Graces&quot;.

In 1815, he was named &#x27;Minister Plenipotentiary of the Pope,&#x27; and was tasked by Pope Pius VI with recovering various works of art that were taken to Paris by Napoleon under the terms of the Treaty of Paris (1815). At the Louvre, he faced resistance to restitution from Director Vivant Denon and, due to the works&#x27; large size or unclear location, was forced to leave behind major pieces, such as Paolo Veronese&#x27;s painting &quot;The Wedding at Cana.&quot; 

Also in 1815, he visited London, and met with Benjamin Haydon. It was after the advice of Canova that the Elgin Marbles were acquired by the British Museum, with plaster copies sent to Florence, according to Canova&#x27;s request.

===Returning to Italy===
In 1816, Canova returned to Rome with some of the art Napoleon had taken. He was rewarded with several marks of distinction: he was appointed President of the Accademia di San Luca, inscribed into the &quot;Golden Book of Roman Nobles&quot; by the Pope&#x27;s own hands, and given the title of Marquis of Ischia, alongside an annual pension of 3,000 crowns.

In 1819, he commenced and completed his commissioned work &quot;Venus Italica&quot; as a replacement for the Venus de&#x27; Medici.

After his 1814 proposal to build a personified statue of Religion for St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica was rejected, Canova sought to build his own temple to house it. This project came to be the Tempio Canoviano. Canova designed, financed, and partly built the structure himself. The structure was to be a testament to Canova&#x27;s piety. The building&#x27;s design was inspired by combining the Parthenon and the Pantheon together. On 11 July 1819, Canova laid the foundation stone dressed in red Papal uniform and decorated with all his medals. It first opened in 1830, and was finally completed in 1836. After the foundation-stone of this edifice had been laid, Canova returned to Rome; but every succeeding autumn he continued to visit Possagno to direct the workmen and encourage them with rewards.

During the period that intervened between commencing operations at Possagno and his death, he executed or finished some of his most striking works. Among these were the group &quot;Mars and Venus&quot;, the colossal figure of Pius VI, the Pietà, the &quot;St John&quot;, and a colossal bust of his friend, the Count Leopoldo Cicognara.

In 1820, he made a statue of George Washington for the state of North Carolina. As recommended by Thomas Jefferson, the sculptor used the marble bust of Washington by Giuseppe Ceracchi as a model. It was delivered on 24 December 1821. The statue and the North Carolina State House where it was displayed were later destroyed by fire in 1831. A plaster replica was sent by King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy in 1910, now on view at the North Carolina Museum of History. A marble copy was sculpted by Romano Vio in 1970, now on view in the rotunda of the capitol building.

In 1822, he journeyed to Naples, to superintend the construction of wax moulds for an equestrian statue of Ferdinand VII. The adventure was disastrous to his health, but soon became healthy enough to return to Rome. From there, he voyaged to Venice; however, on 13 October 1822, he died there at the age of 64. As he never married, the name became extinct, except through his stepbrothers&#x27; lineage of Satori-Canova.

On 12 October 1822, Canova instructed his brother to use his entire estate to complete the Tempio in Possagno.

On 25 October 1822, his body was placed in the Tempio Canoviano. His heart was interred at the Basilica di Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari in Venice, and his right hand preserved in a vase at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia.

His memorial service was so grand that it rivaled the ceremony that the city of Florence held for Michelangelo in 1564.

In 1826, Giovanni Battista Sartori sold Canova&#x27;s Roman studio and took every plaster model and sculpture to Possagno, where they were installed in the gypsotheque of the Tempio Canoviano.

==Works==
Among Canova&#x27;s most notable works are:

===&quot;Psyche Revived by Cupid&#x27;s Kiss&quot; (1787)===

&quot;Psyche Revived by Cupid&#x27;s Kiss&quot; was commissioned in 1787 by Colonel John Campbell. It is regarded as a masterpiece of Neoclassical sculpture, but shows the mythological lovers at a moment of great emotion, characteristic of the emerging movement of Romanticism. It represents the god Cupid in the height of love and tenderness, immediately after awakening the lifeless Psyche with a kiss.

===&quot;Napoleon as Mars the Peacemaker&quot; (1802–1806)===
&quot;Napoleon as Mars the Peacemaker&quot; had its inception after Canova was hired to make a bust of Napoleon in 1802. The statue was begun in 1802, with Napoleon requesting to be shown in a French General&#x27;s uniform, Canova rejected this, insisting on an allusion to Mars, the Roman god of War. It was completed in 1806. In 1811, the statue arrived in Paris, but not installed; neither was its bronze copy in the Foro Napoleonico in Milan. In 1815, the original went to the Duke of Wellington, after his victory at Waterloo against Napoleon and is on display at Apsley House.

===&quot;Perseus Triumphant&quot; (1804–1806)===

&quot;Perseus Triumphant&quot;, sometimes called &quot;Perseus with the Head of Medusa&quot;, was a statue commissioned by tribune Onorato Duveyriez. It depicts the Greek hero Perseus after his victory over the Gorgon Medusa.

The statue was based freely on the Apollo Belvedere and the Medusa Rondanini.

Napoleon, after his 1796 Italian Campaign, took the Apollo Belvedere to Paris. In the statue&#x27;s absence, Pope Pius VII acquired Canova&#x27;s &quot;Perseus Triumphant&quot; and placed the work upon the &quot;Apollo&quot;&#x27;s pedestal. The statue was so successful that when the &quot;Apollo&quot; was returned, &quot;Perseus&quot; remained as a companion piece.

One replica of the statue was commissioned from Canova by the Polish countess Waleria Tarnowska; it&#x27;s now displayed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.

Karl Ludwig Fernow said of the statue that &quot;every eye must rest with pleasure on the beautiful surface, even when the mind finds its hopes of high and pure enjoyment disappointed.&quot;

===&quot;Venus Victrix&quot; (1805–1808)===
&quot;Venus Victrix&quot; ranks among the most famous of Canova&#x27;s works. Originally, Canova wished the depiction to be of a robed Diana, but Pauline Borghese insisted to appear as a nude Venus. The work was not intended for public viewing.

===&quot;The Three Graces&quot; (1814–1817)===

John Russell, the 6th Duke of Bedford, commissioned a version of the now famous work. He had previously visited Canova in his studio in Rome in 1814 and had been immensely impressed by a carving of the Graces the sculptor had made for the Empress Joséphine. When the Empress died in May of the same year he immediately offered to purchase the completed piece, but was unsuccessful as Josephine&#x27;s son Eugène de Beauharnais claimed it (his son Maximilian, Duke of Leuchtenberg brought it to St. Petersburg, where it can now be found in the Hermitage Museum). Undeterred, the Duke commissioned another version for himself.

The sculpting process began in 1814 and was completed in 1817. Finally in 1819 it was installed at the Duke&#x27;s residence in Woburn Abbey. Canova even made the trip over to England to supervise its installation, choosing for it to be displayed on a pedestal adapted from a marble plinth with a rotating top. This version is now owned jointly by the Victoria and Albert Museum and the National Galleries of Scotland, and is alternately displayed at each.

==Artistic process==
Canova had a distinct, signature style in which he combined Greek and Roman art practices with early stirrings of romanticism to delve into a new path of Neoclassicism. Canova&#x27;s sculptures fall into three categories: Heroic compositions, compositions of grace, and sepulchral monuments. In each of these, Canova&#x27;s underlying artistic motivations were to challenge, if not compete, with classical statues.

Canova refused to take in pupils and students, but would hire workers to carve the initial figure from the marble. According to art historian Giuseppe Pavanello, &quot;Canova&#x27;s system of work concentrated on the initial idea, and on the final carving of the marble&quot;. He had an elaborate system of comparative pointing so that the workers were able to reproduce the plaster form in the selected block of marble. These workers would leave a thin veil over the entire statue so Canova&#x27;s could focus on the surface of the statue.

While he worked, he had people read to him select literary and historical texts.

===Last touch===
During the last quarter of the eighteenth century, it became fashionable to view art galleries at night by torchlight. Canova was an artist that leapt on the fad and displayed his works of art in his studio by candlelight. As such, Canova would begin to finalize the statue with special tools by candlelight, to soften the transitions between the various parts of the nude. After a little recarving, he began to rub the statue down with pumice stone, sometimes for periods longer than weeks or months. If that was not enough, he would use tripoli (rottenstone) and lead.

He then applied a now unknown chemical-composition of patina onto the flesh of the figure to lighten the skin tone. Importantly, his friends also denied any usage of acids in his process.

==Criticisms==
Conversations revolving around the justification of art as superfluous usually invoked the name of Canova. Karl Ludwig Fernow believed that Canova was not Kantian enough in his aesthetic, because emphasis seemed to have been placed on agreeableness rather than Beauty. Canova was faulted for creating works that were artificial in complexity.

==Legacy==

Although the Romantic period artists buried Canova&#x27;s name soon after he died, he is slowly being rediscovered. Giuseppe Pavanello wrote in 1996 that &quot;the importance and value of Canova&#x27;s art is now recognized as holding in balance the last echo of the Ancients and the first symptom of the restless experimentation of the modern age&quot;.

Canova spent large parts of his fortune helping young students and sending patrons to struggling sculptors, including Sir Richard Westmacott and John Gibson.

He was introduced into various orders of chivalry.

A number of his works, sketches, and writings are collected in the &quot;Sala Canoviana&quot; of the Museo Civico of Bassano del Grappa. Other works, including plaster casts are the Museo Canoviano in Asolo.

In 2018, a crater on Mercury was named in his honor.

==Literary inspirations==

Two of Canova&#x27;s works appear as engravings in &quot;Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book&quot;, 1834, with poetical illustrations by Letitia Elizabeth Landon. These are of &quot;The Dancing Girl&quot; and &quot;Hebe&quot;.

<doc id="2065" wikidata="Q30755" url="?curid=2065" title="Auguste Rodin">
<text>François Auguste René Rodin (; ; 12 November 184017 November 1917) was a French sculptor generally considered the founder of modern sculpture. He was schooled traditionally and took a craftsman-like approach to his work. Rodin possessed a unique ability to model a complex, turbulent, and deeply pocketed surface in clay. He is known for such sculptures as &quot;The Thinker&quot;, &quot;Monument to Balzac&quot;, &quot;The Kiss&quot;, &quot;The Burghers of Calais&quot;, and &quot;The Gates of Hell&quot;.

Many of Rodin&#x27;s most notable sculptures were criticized, as they clashed with predominant figurative sculpture traditions in which works were decorative, formulaic, or highly thematic. Rodin&#x27;s most original work departed from traditional themes of mythology and allegory. He modeled the human body with naturalism, and his sculptures celebrate individual character and physicality. Although Rodin was sensitive to the controversy surrounding his work, he refused to change his style, and his continued output brought increasing favor from the government and the artistic community.

From the unexpected naturalism of Rodin&#x27;s first major figure – inspired by his 1875 trip to Italy – to the unconventional memorials whose commissions he later sought, his reputation grew, and Rodin became the preeminent French sculptor of his time. By 1900, he was a world-renowned artist. Wealthy private clients sought Rodin&#x27;s work after his World&#x27;s Fair exhibit, and he kept company with a variety of high-profile intellectuals and artists. His student, Camille Claudel, became his associate, lover, and creative rival. Rodin&#x27;s other students included Antoine Bourdelle, Constantin Brâncuși, and Charles Despiau. He married his lifelong companion, Rose Beuret, in the last year of both their lives. His sculptures suffered a decline in popularity after his death in 1917, but within a few decades his legacy solidified. Rodin remains one of the few sculptors widely known outside the visual arts community.

==Biography==

===Formative years===
Rodin was born in 1840 into a working-class family in Paris, the second child of Marie Cheffer and Jean-Baptiste Rodin, who was a police department clerk. He was largely self-educated, and began to draw at age 10. Between ages 14 and 17, he attended the &quot;Petite École&quot;, a school specializing in art and mathematics where he studied drawing and painting. His drawing teacher Horace Lecoq de Boisbaudran believed in first developing the personality of his students so that they observed with their own eyes and drew from their recollections, and Rodin expressed appreciation for his teacher much later in life. It was at Petite École that he met Jules Dalou and Alphonse Legros.
In 1857, Rodin submitted a clay model of a companion to the École des Beaux-Arts in an attempt to win entrance; he did not succeed, and two further applications were also denied. Entrance requirements were not particularly high at the &quot;Grande École&quot;, so the rejections were considerable setbacks. Rodin&#x27;s inability to gain entrance may have been due to the judges&#x27; Neoclassical tastes, while Rodin had been schooled in light, 18th-century sculpture. He left the &quot;Petite École&quot; in 1857 and earned a living as a craftsman and ornamenter for most of the next two decades, producing decorative objects and architectural embellishments.

Rodin&#x27;s sister Maria, two years his senior, died of peritonitis in a convent in 1862, and Rodin was anguished with guilt because he had introduced her to an unfaithful suitor. He turned away from art and joined the Catholic order of the Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament as a laybrother. Saint Peter Julian Eymard, founder and head of the congregation, recognized Rodin&#x27;s talent and sensed his lack of suitability for the order, so he encouraged Rodin to continue with his sculpture. Rodin returned to work as a decorator while taking classes with animal sculptor Antoine-Louis Barye. The teacher&#x27;s attention to detail and his finely rendered musculature of animals in motion significantly influenced Rodin.

In 1864, Rodin began to live with a young seamstress named Rose Beuret (born in June 1844), with whom he stayed for the rest of his life, with varying commitment. The couple had a son named Auguste-Eugène Beuret (1866–1934). That year, Rodin offered his first sculpture for exhibition and entered the studio of Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse, a successful mass producer of &quot;objets d&#x27;art&quot;. Rodin worked as Carrier-Belleuse&#x27; chief assistant until 1870, designing roof decorations and staircase and doorway embellishments. With the arrival of the Franco-Prussian War, Rodin was called to serve in the French National Guard, but his service was brief due to his near-sightedness. Decorators&#x27; work had dwindled because of the war, yet Rodin needed to support his family, as poverty was a continual difficulty for him until about the age of 30. Carrier-Belleuse soon asked him to join him in Belgium, where they worked on ornamentation for the Brussels Stock Exchange.

Rodin planned to stay in Belgium a few months, but he spent the next six years outside of France. It was a pivotal time in his life. He had acquired skill and experience as a craftsman, but no one had yet seen his art, which sat in his workshop since he could not afford castings. His relationship with Carrier-Belleuse had deteriorated, but he found other employment in Brussels, displaying some works at salons, and his companion Rose soon joined him there. Having saved enough money to travel, Rodin visited Italy for two months in 1875, where he was drawn to the work of Donatello and Michelangelo. Their work had a profound effect on his artistic direction. Rodin said, &quot;It is Michelangelo who has freed me from academic sculpture.&quot; Returning to Belgium, he began work on &quot;The Age of Bronze&quot;, a life-size male figure whose naturalism brought Rodin attention but led to accusations of sculptural cheatingits naturalism and scale was such that critics alleged he had cast the work from a living model. Much of Rodin&#x27;s later work was explicitly larger or smaller than life, in part to demonstrate the folly of such accusations.

===Artistic independence===
Rose Beuret and Rodin returned to Paris in 1877, moving into a small flat on the Left Bank. Misfortune surrounded Rodin: his mother, who had wanted to see her son marry, was dead, and his father was blind and senile, cared for by Rodin&#x27;s sister-in-law, Aunt Thérèse. Rodin&#x27;s eleven-year-old son Auguste, possibly developmentally delayed, was also in the ever-helpful Thérèse&#x27;s care. Rodin had essentially abandoned his son for six years, and would have a very limited relationship with him throughout his life. Father and son joined the couple in their flat, with Rose as caretaker. Charges of fakery surrounding &quot;The Age of Bronze&quot; continued. Rodin increasingly sought soothing female companionship in Paris, and Rose stayed in the background.

Rodin earned his living collaborating with more established sculptors on public commissions, primarily memorials and neo-baroque architectural pieces in the style of Carpeaux. In competitions for commissions he submitted models of Denis Diderot, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Lazare Carnot, all to no avail. On his own time, he worked on studies leading to the creation of his next important work, &quot;St. John the Baptist Preaching&quot;.

In 1880, Carrier-Belleuse – then art director of the Sèvres national porcelain factory – offered Rodin a part-time position as a designer. The offer was in part a gesture of reconciliation, and Rodin accepted. That part of Rodin which appreciated 18th-century tastes was aroused, and he immersed himself in designs for vases and table ornaments that brought the factory renown across Europe.

The artistic community appreciated his work in this vein, and Rodin was invited to Paris Salons by such friends as writer Léon Cladel. During his early appearances at these social events, Rodin seemed shy; in his later years, as his fame grew, he displayed the loquaciousness and temperament for which he is better known. French statesman Leon Gambetta expressed a desire to meet Rodin, and the sculptor impressed him when they met at a salon. Gambetta spoke of Rodin in turn to several government ministers, likely including , the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Fine Arts, whom Rodin eventually met.

Rodin&#x27;s relationship with Turquet was rewarding. Through Turquet, he won the 1880 commission to create a portal for a planned museum of decorative arts. Rodin dedicated much of the next four decades to his elaborate &quot;Gates of Hell&quot;, an unfinished portal for a museum that was never built. Many of the portal&#x27;s figures became sculptures in themselves, including Rodin&#x27;s most famous, &quot;The Thinker&quot; and &quot;The Kiss&quot;. With the museum commission came a free studio, granting Rodin a new level of artistic freedom. Soon, he stopped working at the porcelain factory in 1882; his income came from private commissions.

In 1883, Rodin agreed to supervise a course for sculptor Alfred Boucher in his absence, where he met the 18-year-old Camille Claudel. The two formed a passionate but stormy relationship and influenced each other artistically. Claudel inspired Rodin as a model for many of his figures, and she was a talented sculptor, assisting him on commissions as well as creating her own works. Her &quot;Bust of Rodin&quot; was displayed to critical acclaim at the 1892 Salon.

Although busy with &quot;The Gates of Hell&quot;, Rodin won other commissions. He pursued an opportunity to create a historical monument for the town of Calais. For a monument to French author Honoré de Balzac, Rodin was chosen in 1891. His execution of both sculptures clashed with traditional tastes and met with varying degrees of disapproval from the organizations that sponsored the commissions. Still, Rodin was gaining support from diverse sources that propelled him toward fame.

In 1889, the Paris Salon invited Rodin to be a judge on its artistic jury. Though Rodin&#x27;s career was on the rise, Claudel and Beuret were becoming increasingly impatient with Rodin&#x27;s &quot;double life&quot;. Claudel and Rodin shared an at a small old castle (the Château de l&#x27;Islette in the Loire), but Rodin refused to relinquish his ties to Beuret, his loyal companion during the lean years, and mother of his son. During one absence, Rodin wrote to Beuret, &quot;I think of how much you must have loved me to put up with my caprices...I remain, in all tenderness, your Rodin.&quot;

Claudel and Rodin parted in 1898. Claudel suffered an alleged nervous breakdown several years later and was confined to an institution for 30 years by her family, until her death in 1943, despite numerous attempts by doctors to explain to her mother and brother that she was sane.

In 1904, Rodin was introduced to the Welsh artist, Gwen John, who modelled for him and became his lover after being introduced by Hilda Flodin. John had a fervent attachment to Rodin and would write to him thousands of times over the next ten years. As their relationship came to a close, despite his genuine feeling for her, Rodin eventually resorted to the use of concièrges and secretaries to keep her at a distance.

==Works==
In 1864, Rodin submitted his first sculpture for exhibition, &quot;The Man with the Broken Nose&quot;, to the Paris Salon. The subject was an elderly neighborhood street porter. The unconventional bronze piece was not a traditional bust, but instead the head was &quot;broken off&quot; at the neck, the nose was flattened and crooked, and the back of the head was absent, having fallen off the clay model in an accident. The work emphasized texture and the emotional state of the subject; it illustrated the &quot;unfinishedness&quot; that would characterize many of Rodin&#x27;s later sculptures. The Salon rejected the piece.

===Early figures: the inspiration of Italy===
In Brussels, Rodin created his first full-scale work, &quot;The Age of Bronze&quot;, having returned from Italy. Modeled after a Belgian soldier, the figure drew inspiration from Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;Dying Slave&quot;, which Rodin had observed at the Louvre. Attempting to combine Michelangelo&#x27;s mastery of the human form with his own sense of human nature, Rodin studied his model from all angles, at rest and in motion; he mounted a ladder for additional perspective, and made clay models, which he studied by candlelight. The result was a life-size, well-proportioned nude figure, posed unconventionally with his right hand atop his head, and his left arm held out at his side, forearm parallel to the body.

In 1877, the work debuted in Brussels and then was shown at the Paris Salon. The statue&#x27;s apparent lack of a theme was troubling to critics – commemorating neither mythology nor a noble historical event – and it is not clear whether Rodin intended a theme. He first titled the work &quot;The Vanquished&quot;, in which form the left hand held a spear, but he removed the spear because it obstructed the torso from certain angles. After two more intermediary titles, Rodin settled on &quot;The Age of Bronze&quot;, suggesting the Bronze Age, and in Rodin&#x27;s words, &quot;man arising from nature&quot;. Later, however, Rodin said that he had had in mind &quot;just a simple piece of sculpture without reference to subject&quot;.

Its mastery of form, light, and shadow made the work look so naturalistic that Rodin was accused of &quot;surmoulage&quot; – having taken a cast from a living model. Rodin vigorously denied the charges, writing to newspapers and having photographs taken of the model to prove how the sculpture differed. He demanded an inquiry and was eventually exonerated by a committee of sculptors. Leaving aside the false charges, the piece polarized critics. It had barely won acceptance for display at the Paris Salon, and criticism likened it to &quot;a statue of a sleepwalker&quot; and called it &quot;an astonishingly accurate copy of a low type&quot;. Others rallied to defend the piece and Rodin&#x27;s integrity. The government minister Turquet admired the piece, and &quot;The Age of Bronze&quot; was purchased by the state for 2,200 francs – what it had cost Rodin to have it cast in bronze.
A second male nude, &quot;St. John the Baptist Preaching&quot;, was completed in 1878. Rodin sought to avoid another charge of &quot;surmoulage&quot; by making the statue larger than life: &quot;St. John&quot; stands almost . While &quot;The Age of Bronze&quot; is statically posed, &quot;St. John&quot; gestures and seems to move toward the viewer. The effect of walking is achieved despite the figure having both feet firmly on the ground – a technical achievement that was lost on most contemporary critics. Rodin chose this contradictory position to, in his words, &quot;display simultaneously...views of an object which in fact can be seen only successively&quot;.

Despite the title, &quot;St. John the Baptist Preaching&quot; did not have an obviously religious theme. The model, an Italian peasant who presented himself at Rodin&#x27;s studio, possessed an idiosyncratic sense of movement that Rodin felt compelled to capture. Rodin thought of John the Baptist and carried that association into the title of the work. In 1880, Rodin submitted the sculpture to the Paris Salon. Critics were still mostly dismissive of his work, but the piece finished third in the Salon&#x27;s sculpture category.

Regardless of the immediate receptions of &quot;St. John&quot; and &quot;The Age of Bronze&quot;, Rodin had achieved a new degree of fame. Students sought him at his studio, praising his work and scorning the charges of &quot;surmoulage&quot;. The artistic community knew his name.

===&quot;The Gates of Hell&quot;===

A commission to create a portal for Paris&#x27; planned Museum of Decorative Arts was awarded to Rodin in 1880. Although the museum was never built, Rodin worked throughout his life on &quot;The Gates of Hell&quot;, a monumental sculptural group depicting scenes from Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot; in high relief. Often lacking a clear conception of his major works, Rodin compensated with hard work and a striving for perfection.

He conceived &quot;The Gates&quot; with the &quot;surmoulage&quot; controversy still in mind: &quot;...I had made the &quot;St. John&quot; to refute [the charges of casting from a model], but it only partially succeeded. To prove completely that I could model from life as well as other sculptors, I determined...to make the sculpture on the door of figures smaller than life.&quot; Laws of composition gave way to the &quot;Gates&quot;&#x27; disordered and untamed depiction of Hell. The figures and groups in this, Rodin&#x27;s meditation on the condition of man, are physically and morally isolated in their torment.

&quot;The Gates of Hell&quot; comprised 186 figures in its final form. Many of Rodin&#x27;s best-known sculptures started as designs of figures for this composition, such as &quot;The Thinker&quot;, &quot;The Three Shades&quot;, and &quot;The Kiss&quot;, and were only later presented as separate and independent works. Other well-known works derived from &quot;The Gates&quot; are &quot;Ugolino&quot;, &quot;Fallen Caryatid Carrying her Stone&quot;, &quot;Fugit Amor&quot;, &quot;She Who Was Once the Helmet-Maker&#x27;s Beautiful Wife&quot;, &quot;The Falling Man&quot;, and &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot;.

===&quot;The Thinker&quot;===
&quot;The Thinker&quot; (originally titled &quot;The Poet&quot;, after Dante) was to become one of the best-known sculptures in the world. The original was a high bronze piece created between 1879 and 1889, designed for the &quot;Gates&quot;&#x27; lintel, from which the figure would gaze down upon Hell. While &quot;The Thinker&quot; most obviously characterizes Dante, aspects of the Biblical Adam, the mythological Prometheus, and Rodin himself have been ascribed to him. Other observers de-emphasize the apparent intellectual theme of &quot;The Thinker&quot;, stressing the figure&#x27;s rough physicality and the emotional tension emanating from it.

===&quot;The Burghers of Calais&quot;===

The town of Calais had contemplated a historical monument for decades when Rodin learned of the project. He pursued the commission, interested in the medieval motif and patriotic theme. The mayor of Calais was tempted to hire Rodin on the spot upon visiting his studio, and soon the memorial was approved, with Rodin as its architect. It would commemorate the six townspeople of Calais who offered their lives to save their fellow citizens.

During the Hundred Years&#x27; War, the army of King Edward III besieged Calais, and Edward ordered that the town&#x27;s population be killed &quot;en masse&quot;. He agreed to spare them if six of the principal citizens would come to him prepared to die, bareheaded and barefooted and with ropes around their necks. When they came, he ordered that they be executed, but pardoned them when his queen, Philippa of Hainault, begged him to spare their lives. &quot;The Burghers of Calais&quot; depicts the men as they are leaving for the king&#x27;s camp, carrying keys to the town&#x27;s gates and citadel.

Rodin began the project in 1884, inspired by the chronicles of the siege by Jean Froissart. Though the town envisioned an allegorical, heroic piece centered on Eustache de Saint-Pierre, the eldest of the six men, Rodin conceived the sculpture as a study in the varied and complex emotions under which all six men were laboring. One year into the commission, the Calais committee was not impressed with Rodin&#x27;s progress. Rodin indicated his willingness to end the project rather than change his design to meet the committee&#x27;s conservative expectations, but Calais said to continue.

In 1889, &quot;The Burghers of Calais&quot; was first displayed to general acclaim. It is a bronze sculpture weighing , and its figures are tall. The six men portrayed do not display a united, heroic front; rather, each is isolated from his brothers, individually deliberating and struggling with his expected fate. Rodin soon proposed that the monument&#x27;s high pedestal be eliminated, wanting to move the sculpture to ground level so that viewers could &quot;penetrate to the heart of the subject&quot;. At ground level, the figures&#x27; positions lead the viewer around the work, and subtly suggest their common movement forward.

The committee was incensed by the untraditional proposal, but Rodin would not yield. In 1895, Calais succeeded in having &quot;Burghers&quot; displayed in their preferred form: the work was placed in front of a public garden on a high platform, surrounded by a cast-iron railing. Rodin had wanted it located near the town hall, where it would engage the public. Only after damage during the First World War, subsequent storage, and Rodin&#x27;s death was the sculpture displayed as he had intended. It is one of Rodin&#x27;s best-known and most acclaimed works.

===Commissions and controversy ===
Commissioned to create a monument to French writer Victor Hugo in 1889, Rodin dealt extensively with the subject of &quot;artist and muse&quot;. Like many of Rodin&#x27;s public commissions, &quot;Monument to Victor Hugo&quot; was met with resistance because it did not fit conventional expectations. Commenting on Rodin&#x27;s monument to Victor Hugo, &quot;The Times&quot; in 1909 expressed that &quot;there is some show of reason in the complaint that [Rodin&#x27;s] conceptions are sometimes unsuited to his medium, and that in such cases they overstrain his vast technical powers&quot;. The 1897 plaster model was not cast in bronze until 1964.

The &quot;Société des Gens des Lettres&quot;, a Parisian organization of writers, planned a monument to French novelist Honoré de Balzac immediately after his death in 1850. The society commissioned Rodin to create the memorial in 1891, and Rodin spent years developing the concept for his sculpture. Challenged in finding an appropriate representation of Balzac given the author&#x27;s rotund physique, Rodin produced many studies: portraits, full-length figures in the nude, wearing a frock coat, or in a robe – a replica of which Rodin had requested. The realized sculpture displays Balzac cloaked in the drapery, looking forcefully into the distance with deeply gouged features. Rodin&#x27;s intent had been to show Balzac at the moment of conceiving a work – to express courage, labor, and struggle.
When &quot;Monument to Balzac&quot; was exhibited in 1898, the negative reaction was not surprising. The &quot;Société&quot; rejected the work, and the press ran parodies. Criticizing the work, Morey (1918) reflected, &quot;there may come a time, and doubtless will come a time, when it will not seem &quot;outre&quot; to represent a great novelist as a huge comic mask crowning a bathrobe, but even at the present day this statue impresses one as slang.&quot; A modern critic, indeed, claims that &quot;Balzac&quot; is one of Rodin&#x27;s masterpieces.

The monument had its supporters in Rodin&#x27;s day; a manifesto defending him was signed by Monet, Debussy, and future Premier Georges Clemenceau, among many others. In the BBC series &quot;Civilisation&quot;, art historian Kenneth Clark praised the monument as &quot;the greatest piece of sculpture of the 19th Century, perhaps, indeed, the greatest since Michelangelo.&quot; Rather than try to convince skeptics of the merit of the monument, Rodin repaid the &quot;Société&quot; his commission and moved the figure to his garden. After this experience, Rodin did not complete another public commission. Only in 1939 was &quot;Monument to Balzac&quot; cast in bronze and placed on the Boulevard du Montparnasse at the intersection with Boulevard Raspail.

===Other works===
The popularity of Rodin&#x27;s most famous sculptures tends to obscure his total creative output. A prolific artist, he created thousands of busts, figures, and sculptural fragments over more than five decades. He painted in oils (especially in his thirties) and in watercolors. The Musée Rodin holds 7,000 of his drawings and prints, in chalk and charcoal, and thirteen vigorous drypoints. He also produced a single lithograph.

Portraiture was an important component of Rodin&#x27;s oeuvre, helping him to win acceptance and financial independence. His first sculpture was a bust of his father in 1860, and he produced at least 56 portraits between 1877 and his death in 1917. Early subjects included fellow sculptor Jules Dalou (1883) and companion Camille Claudel (1884).

Later, with his reputation established, Rodin made busts of prominent contemporaries such as English politician George Wyndham (1905), Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw (1906), socialist (and former mistress of the Prince of Wales who became King Edward VII) Countess of Warwick (1908), Austrian composer Gustav Mahler (1909), former Argentine president Domingo Faustino Sarmiento and French statesman Georges Clemenceau (1911).

His undated drawing &quot;Study of a Woman Nude, Standing, Arms Raised, Hands Crossed Above Head&quot; is one of the works seized in 2012 from the collection of Cornelius Gurlitt.

==Aesthetic==
Rodin was a naturalist, less concerned with monumental expression than with character and emotion. Departing with centuries of tradition, he turned away from the idealism of the Greeks, and the decorative beauty of the Baroque and neo-Baroque movements. His sculpture emphasized the individual and the concreteness of flesh, and suggested emotion through detailed, textured surfaces, and the interplay of light and shadow. To a greater degree than his contemporaries, Rodin believed that an individual&#x27;s character was revealed by his physical features.

Rodin&#x27;s talent for surface modeling allowed him to let every part of the body speak for the whole. The male&#x27;s passion in &quot;The Thinker&quot; is suggested by the grip of his toes on the rock, the rigidness of his back, and the differentiation of his hands. Speaking of &quot;The Thinker&quot;, Rodin illuminated his aesthetic: &quot;What makes my Thinker think is that he thinks not only with his brain, with his knitted brow, his distended nostrils and compressed lips, but with every muscle of his arms, back, and legs, with his clenched fist and gripping toes.&quot;

Sculptural fragments to Rodin were autonomous works, and he considered them the essence of his artistic statement. His fragments – perhaps lacking arms, legs, or a head – took sculpture further from its traditional role of portraying likenesses, and into a realm where forms existed for their own sake. Notable examples are &quot;The Walking Man&quot;, &quot;Meditation without Arms&quot;, and &quot;Iris, Messenger of the Gods&quot;.

Rodin saw suffering and conflict as hallmarks of modern art. &quot;Nothing, really, is more moving than the maddened beast, dying from unfulfilled desire and asking in vain for grace to quell its passion.&quot; Charles Baudelaire echoed those themes and was among Rodin&#x27;s favorite poets. Rodin enjoyed music, especially the opera composer Gluck, and wrote a book about French cathedrals. He owned a work by the as-yet-unrecognized Van Gogh and admired the forgotten El Greco.

===Method===
Instead of copying traditional academic postures, Rodin preferred his models to move naturally around his studio (despite their nakedness). The sculptor often made quick sketches in clay that were later fine-tuned, cast in plaster, and cast in bronze or carved from marble. Rodin&#x27;s focus was on the handling of clay.

George Bernard Shaw sat for a portrait and gave an idea of Rodin&#x27;s technique: &quot;While he worked, he achieved a number of miracles. At the end of the first fifteen minutes, after having given a simple idea of the human form to the block of clay, he produced by the action of his thumb a bust so living that I would have taken it away with me to relieve the sculptor of any further work.&quot;

He described the evolution of his bust over a month, passing through &quot;all the stages of art&#x27;s evolution&quot;: first, a &quot;Byzantine masterpiece&quot;, then &quot;Bernini intermingled&quot;, then an elegant Houdon. &quot;The hand of Rodin worked not as the hand of a sculptor works, but as the work of &quot;Elan Vital&quot;. The &quot;Hand of God&quot; is his own hand.&quot;

After he completed his work in clay, he employed highly skilled assistants to re-sculpt his compositions at larger sizes (including any of his large-scale monuments such as &quot;The Thinker&quot;), to cast the clay compositions into plaster or bronze, and to carve his marbles. Rodin&#x27;s major innovation was to capitalize on such multi-staged processes of 19th century sculpture and their reliance on plaster casting.

Since clay deteriorates rapidly if not kept wet or fired into a terra-cotta, sculptors used plaster casts as a means of securing the composition they would make from the fugitive material that is clay. This was common practice amongst Rodin&#x27;s contemporaries, and sculptors would exhibit plaster casts with the hopes that they would be commissioned to have the works made in a more permanent material. Rodin, however, would have multiple plasters made and treat them as the raw material of sculpture, recombining their parts and figures into new compositions, and new names.

As Rodin&#x27;s practice developed into the 1890s, he became more and more radical in his pursuit of fragmentation, the combination of figures at different scales, and the making of new compositions from his earlier work. A prime example of this is the bold &quot;The Walking Man&quot; (1899–1900), which was exhibited at his major one-person show in 1900. This is composed of two sculptures from the 1870s that Rodin found in his studio – a broken and damaged torso that had fallen into neglect and the lower extremities of a statuette version of his 1878 &quot;St. John the Baptist Preaching&quot; he was having re-sculpted at a reduced scale.

Without finessing the join between upper and lower, between torso and legs, Rodin created a work that many sculptors at the time and subsequently have seen as one of his strongest and most singular works. This is despite the fact that the object conveys two different styles, exhibits two different attitudes toward finish, and lacks any attempt to hide the arbitrary fusion of these two components. It was the freedom and creativity with which Rodin used these practices – along with his activation surfaces of sculptures through traces of his own touch and with his more open attitude toward bodily pose, sensual subject matter, and non-naturalistic surface – that marked Rodin&#x27;s re-making of traditional 19th century sculptural techniques into the prototype for modern sculpture.

==Later years (1900–1917)==
By 1900, Rodin&#x27;s artistic reputation was established. Gaining exposure from a pavilion of his artwork set up near the 1900 World&#x27;s Fair (&quot;Exposition Universelle&quot;) in Paris, he received requests to make busts of prominent people internationally, while his assistants at the atelier produced duplicates of his works. His income from portrait commissions alone totaled probably 200,000 francs a year. As Rodin&#x27;s fame grew, he attracted many followers, including the German poet Rainer Maria Rilke, and authors Octave Mirbeau, Joris-Karl Huysmans, and Oscar Wilde.

Rilke stayed with Rodin in 1905 and 1906 and did administrative work for him; he would later write a laudatory monograph on the sculptor. Rodin and Beuret&#x27;s modest country estate in Meudon, purchased in 1897, was a host to such guests as King Edward, dancer Isadora Duncan, and harpsichordist Wanda Landowska. A British journalist who visited the property noted in 1902 that in its complete isolation, there was &quot;a striking analogy between its situation and the personality of the man who lives in it&quot;. Rodin moved to the city in 1908, renting the main floor of the Hôtel Biron, an 18th-century townhouse. He left Beuret in Meudon and began an affair with the American-born Duchesse de Choiseul. From 1910, he mentored the Russian sculptor, Moissey Kogan.

===United States===
While Rodin was beginning to be accepted in France by the time of &quot;The Burghers of Calais&quot;, he had not yet conquered the American market. Because of his technique and the frankness of some of his work, he did not have an easy time selling his work to American industrialists. However, he came to know Sarah Tyson Hallowell (1846–1924), a curator from Chicago who visited Paris to arrange exhibitions at the large Interstate Expositions of the 1870s and 1880s. Hallowell was not only a curator but an adviser and a facilitator who was trusted by a number of prominent American collectors to suggest works for their collections, the most prominent of these being the Chicago hotelier Potter Palmer and his wife, Bertha Palmer (1849–1918).

The next opportunity for Rodin in America was the 1893 Chicago World&#x27;s Fair. Hallowell wanted to help promote Rodin&#x27;s work and he suggested a solo exhibition, which she wrote him was &quot;beaucoup moins beau que l&#x27;original&quot; but impossible, outside the rules. Instead, she suggested he send a number of works for her loan exhibition of French art from American collections and she told him she would list them as being part of an American collection. Rodin sent Hallowell three works, &quot;Cupid and Psyche&quot;, &quot;Sphinx&quot; and &quot;Andromeda&quot;. All nudes, these works provoked great controversy and were ultimately hidden behind a drape with special permission given for viewers to see them.

&quot;Bust of Dalou&quot; and &quot;Burgher of Calais&quot; were on display in the official French pavilion at the fair and so between the works that were on display and those that were not, he was noticed. However, the works he gave Hallowell to sell found no takers, but she soon brought the controversial Quaker-born financier Charles Yerkes (1837–1905) into the fold and he purchased two large marbles for his Chicago manse; Yerkes was likely the first American to own a Rodin sculpture.

Other collectors soon followed including the tastemaking Potter Palmers of Chicago and Isabella Stewart Gardner (1840–1924) of Boston, all arranged by Sarah Hallowell. In appreciation for her efforts at unlocking the American market, Rodin eventually presented Hallowell with a bronze, a marble and a terra cotta. When Hallowell moved to Paris in 1893, she and Rodin continued their warm friendship and correspondence, which lasted to the end of the sculptor&#x27;s life. After Hallowell&#x27;s death, her niece, the painter Harriet Hallowell, inherited the Rodins and after her death, the American heirs could not manage to match their value in order to export them, so they became the property of the French state.

===Great Britain===
After the start of the 20th century, Rodin was a regular visitor to Great Britain, where he developed a loyal following by the beginning of the First World War. He first visited England in 1881, where his friend, the artist Alphonse Legros, had introduced him to the poet William Ernest Henley. With his personal connections and enthusiasm for Rodin&#x27;s art, Henley was most responsible for Rodin&#x27;s reception in Britain. (Rodin later returned the favor by sculpting a bust of Henley that was used as the frontispiece to Henley&#x27;s collected works and, after his death, on his monument in London.)

Through Henley, Rodin met Robert Louis Stevenson and Robert Browning, in whom he found further support. Encouraged by the enthusiasm of British artists, students, and high society for his art, Rodin donated a selection of his works to the nation in 1914.

After the revitalization of the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts in 1890, Rodin served as the body&#x27;s vice-president. In 1903, Rodin was elected president of the International Society of Painters, Sculptors, and Engravers. He replaced its former president, James Abbott McNeill Whistler, upon Whistler&#x27;s death. His election to the prestigious position was largely due to the efforts of Albert Ludovici, father of English philosopher Anthony Ludovici, who was private secretary to Rodin for several months in 1906, but the two men parted company after Christmas, &quot;to their mutual relief.&quot;

During his later creative years, Rodin&#x27;s work turned increasingly toward the female form, and themes of more overt masculinity and femininity. He concentrated on small dance studies, and produced numerous erotic drawings, sketched in a loose way, without taking his pencil from the paper or his eyes from the model. Rodin met American dancer Isadora Duncan in 1900, attempted to seduce her, and the next year sketched studies of her and her students. In July 1906, Rodin was also enchanted by dancers from the Royal Ballet of Cambodia and produced some of his most famous drawings from the experience.

Fifty-three years into their relationship, Rodin married Rose Beuret. They married on 29 January 1917, and Beuret died two weeks later, on 16 February. Rodin was ill that year; in January, he suffered weakness from influenza, and on 16 November his physician announced that &quot;congestion of the lungs has caused great weakness. The patient&#x27;s condition is grave.&quot; Rodin died the next day, age 77, at his villa in Meudon, Île-de-France, on the outskirts of Paris.

A cast of &quot;The Thinker&quot; was placed next to his tomb in Meudon; it was Rodin&#x27;s wish that the figure served as his headstone and epitaph. In 1923, Marcell Tirel, Rodin&#x27;s secretary, published a book alleging that Rodin&#x27;s death was largely due to cold, and the fact that he had no heat at Meudon. Rodin requested permission to stay in the Hotel Biron, a museum of his works, but the director of the museum refused to let him stay there.

==Legacy==
Rodin willed to the French state his studio and the right to make casts from his plasters. Because he encouraged the edition of his sculpted work, Rodin&#x27;s sculptures are represented in many public and private collections. The Musée Rodin was founded in 1916 and opened in 1919 at the Hôtel Biron, where Rodin had lived, and it holds the largest Rodin collection, with more than 6,000 sculptures and 7,000 works on paper. The French order made him a Commander, and he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford.

During his lifetime, Rodin was compared to Michelangelo, and was widely recognized as the greatest artist of the era. In the three decades following his death, his popularity waned with changing aesthetic values. Since the 1950s, Rodin&#x27;s reputation has re-ascended; he is recognized as the most important sculptor of the modern era, and has been the subject of much scholarly work. The sense of incompletion offered by some of his sculpture, such as &quot;The Walking Man&quot;, influenced the increasingly abstract sculptural forms of the 20th century.

Rodin restored an ancient role of sculpture – to capture the physical and intellectual force of the human subject – and he freed sculpture from the repetition of traditional patterns, providing the foundation for greater experimentation in the 20th century. His popularity is ascribed to his emotion-laden representations of ordinary men and women – to his ability to find the beauty and pathos in the human animal. His most popular works, such as &quot;The Kiss&quot; and &quot;The Thinker&quot;, are widely used outside the fine arts as symbols of human emotion and character. To honor Rodin&#x27;s artistic legacy, the Google search engine homepage displayed a Google Doodle featuring &quot;The Thinker&quot; to celebrate his 172nd birthday on 12 November 2012.

Rodin had enormous artistic influence. A whole generation of sculptors studied in his workshop. These include Gutzon Borglum, Antoine Bourdelle, Constantin Brâncuși, Camille Claudel, Charles Despiau, Malvina Hoffman, Carl Milles, François Pompon, Rodo, Gustav Vigeland, Clara Westhoff and Margaret Winser, even though Brancusi later rejected his legacy. Rodin also promoted the work of other sculptors, including Aristide Maillol and Ivan Meštrović whom Rodin once called &quot;the greatest phenomenon amongst sculptors.&quot; Other sculptors whose work has been described as owing to Rodin include Joseph Csaky, Alexander Archipenko, Joseph Bernard, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, Georg Kolbe, Wilhelm Lehmbruck, Jacques Lipchitz, Pablo Picasso, Adolfo Wildt, and Ossip Zadkine. Henry Moore acknowledged Rodin&#x27;s seminal influence on his work.

Several films have been made featuring Rodin as a prominent character or presence. These include &quot;Camille Claudel&quot;, a 1988 film in which Gérard Depardieu portrays Rodin, &quot;Camille Claudel 1915&quot; from 2013, and &quot;Rodin&quot;, a 2017 film starring Vincent Lindon as Rodin. Furthermore, the Rodin Studios artists&#x27; cooperative housing in New York City, completed in 1917 to designs by Cass Gilbert, was named after Rodin.

===Forgeries===
The relative ease of making reproductions has also encouraged many forgeries: a survey of expert opinion placed Rodin in the top ten most-faked artists. Rodin fought against forgeries of his works as early as 1901, and since his death, many cases of organized, large-scale forgeries have been revealed. A massive forgery was discovered by French authorities in the early 1990s and led to the conviction of art dealer Guy Hain.

To deal with the complexity of bronze reproduction, France has promulgated several laws since 1956 which limit reproduction to twelve casts – the maximum number that can be made from an artist&#x27;s plasters and still be considered his work. As a result of this limit, &quot;The Burghers of Calais&quot;, for example, is found in fourteen cities.

In the market for sculpture, plagued by fakes, the value of a piece increases significantly when its provenance can be established. A Rodin work with a verified history sold for US$4.8 million in 1999, and Rodin&#x27;s bronze &quot;Ève, grand modele – version sans rocher&quot; sold for $18.9 million at a 2008 Christie&#x27;s auction in New York. Art critics concerned about authenticity have argued that taking a cast does not equal reproducing a Rodin sculpture – especially given the importance of surface treatment in Rodin&#x27;s work.

A number of drawings previously attributed to Rodin are now known to have been forged by Ernest Durig.

<text>Ann Arbor is a city in and the seat of government of Washtenaw County, Michigan, United States. The 2020 census recorded its population to be 123,851, making it the fifth-most populous city in Michigan. Located on the Huron River, Ann Arbor is the principal city of its metropolitan area, which encompasses all of Washtenaw County and had 372,258 residents in 2020. Ann Arbor is included in the Detroit-Warren-Ann Arbor combined statistical area and the Great Lakes megalopolis.

Ann Arbor was founded in 1824 by John Allen and Elisha Rumsey. It was named after the wives of the village&#x27;s founders, both named Ann, and the stands of bur oak trees they found at the site of the town. The University of Michigan was established in Ann Arbor in 1837, and the city&#x27;s population grew at a rapid rate in the early to mid-20th century.

A college town, Ann Arbor is currently home to the University of Michigan, which significantly shapes the city&#x27;s economy, employing about 30,000 workers which includes about 12,000 in its medical center. The city&#x27;s economy is also centered on high technology, with several companies drawn to the area by the university&#x27;s research and development infrastructure. The city has been a center for progressive politics as well as several social and religious movements.

==History==
=== Before founding as Ann Arbor ===
The lands of present-day Ann Arbor were part of Massachusetts&#x27;s western claim after the French and Indian War (1754–1763), bounded by the latitudes of Massachusetts Bay Colony&#x27;s original charter, to which it was entitled by its interpretation of its original sea-to-sea grant from the British Crown. Massachusetts ceded the claim to the federal government as part of the Northwest Territory after April 19, 1785.

The region was once inhabited by several Native American tribes, the most prominent being the Anishinaabe people of the Three Fires — the Odawa, Ojibwe, and Potawatomi. The Potawatomi founded two villages in the area of what is now Ann Arbor in about 1774. Other tribes that inhabited the area included the Fox, Wyandots, and Sauk. These peoples established several trails that converged on present-day Ann Arbor. The land that included Washtenaw County was ceded to the U.S. by the Odawa, Ojibwe, Potawatomi, and Wyandot in the Treaty of Detroit of 1807.

=== 19th century ===
Ann Arbor was founded in 1824 by land speculators John Allen and Elisha Walker Rumsey. On May 25, 1824, the town plat was registered with Wayne County as the Village of Annarbour, the earliest known use of the town&#x27;s name. Allen and Rumsey decided to name it for their wives, both named Ann, and for the stands of bur oak in the of land they purchased for $800 from the federal government at $1.25 per acre. The local Ojibwa named the settlement &quot;kaw-goosh-kaw-nick&quot;, after the sound of Allen&#x27;s sawmill.

Ann Arbor became the seat of Washtenaw County in 1827 and was incorporated as a village in 1833. The Ann Arbor Land Company, a group of speculators, set aside of undeveloped land and offered it to the state of Michigan as the site of the state capitol, but lost the bid to Lansing. In 1837, the property was accepted instead as the site of the University of Michigan.


Since the university&#x27;s establishment in the city in 1837, the histories of the University of Michigan and Ann Arbor have been closely linked. The town became a regional transportation hub in 1839 with the arrival of the Michigan Central Railroad, and a north–south railway connecting Ann Arbor to Toledo and other markets to the south was established in 1878. Throughout the 1840s and the 1850s settlers continued to come to Ann Arbor. While the earlier settlers were primarily of British ancestry, the newer settlers also consisted of Germans, Irish, and Black people. In 1851, Ann Arbor was chartered as a city, though the city showed a drop in population during the Depression of 1873. It was not until the early 1880s that Ann Arbor again saw robust growth, with new immigrants from Greece, Italy, Russia, and Poland.

=== 20th century ===
Ann Arbor saw increased growth in manufacturing, particularly in milling. Ann Arbor&#x27;s Jewish community also grew after the turn of the 20th century, and its first and oldest synagogue, Beth Israel Congregation, was established in 1916.

In 1960, Ann Arbor voters approved a $2.3 million bond issue to build the current city hall, which was designed by architect Alden B. Dow. The City Hall opened in 1963. In 1995, the building was renamed the Guy C. Larcom Jr. Municipal Building in honor of the longtime city administrator who championed the building&#x27;s construction.

During the 1960s and 1970s, the city gained a reputation as an important center for liberal politics. Ann Arbor also became a locus for left-wing activism and anti-Vietnam War movement, as well as the student movement. The first major meetings of the national left-wing campus group Students for a Democratic Society took place in Ann Arbor in 1960; in 1965, the city was home to the first U.S. teach-in against the Vietnam War. During the ensuing 15 years, many countercultural and New Left enterprises sprang up and developed large constituencies within the city. These influences washed into municipal politics during the early and mid-1970s when three members of the Human Rights Party (HRP) won city council seats on the strength of the student vote. During their time on the council, HRP representatives fought for measures including pioneering antidiscrimination ordinances, measures decriminalizing marijuana possession, and a rent-control ordinance.

Two religious-conservative institutions were created in Ann Arbor; the Word of God (established in 1967), a charismatic inter-denominational movement; and the Thomas More Law Center (established in 1999). Since 1998, Ann Arbor is also the home office of the Anthroposophical Society in the United States, an organization dedicated to supporting the community of those interested in the inner path of schooling known as anthroposophy, developed by Rudolf Steiner.

Following a 1956 vote, the city of East Ann Arbor merged with Ann Arbor to encompass the eastern sections of the city.

=== 21st century ===
In the past several decades, Ann Arbor has grappled with the effects of sharply rising land values, gentrification, and urban sprawl stretching into outlying countryside. On November 4, 2003, voters approved a greenbelt plan under which the city government bought development rights on agricultural parcels of land adjacent to Ann Arbor to preserve them from sprawling development. Since then, a vociferous local debate has hinged on how and whether to accommodate and guide development within city limits. Ann Arbor consistently ranks in the &quot;top places to live&quot; lists published by various mainstream media outlets every year.

In 2016, the city changed mayoral terms from two years to four. Until 2017, City Council held annual elections in which half of the seats (one from each ward) were elected to 2-year terms. These elections were staggered, with each ward having one of its seats up for election in odd years and its other seat up for election in even years. Beginning in 2018 the city council has had staggered elections to 4-year terms in even years. This means that half of the members (one from each ward) are elected in presidential election years, while the other half are elected in mid-term election years. To facilitate this change in scheduling, the 2017 election elected members to terms that lasted 3-years.

In 2020, partly as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the city government opened several downtown streets to pedestrians, limiting their use by motor vehicles to emergency vehicles during summertime weekends. In addition to providing a large pedestrian mall, these changes allow restaurants to use more of the sidewalks and part of the street for outdoor seating. These changes were popular enough that in 2021 the city council extended the dates from March to November, continuing the schedule of cordoning off cars from Thursday evening until Monday morning.

==Geography==
Ann Arbor is located along the Huron River, which flows southeast through the city on its way to Lake Erie. It is the central core of the Ann Arbor, MI Metropolitan Statistical Area, which consists of the whole of Washtenaw County, but is also a part of the Metro Detroit Combined Statistical Area designated by the U.S. Census Bureau. While it borders only Townships, the built-up nature of the sections of Pittsfield and Ypsilanti townships between Ann Arbor and the city of Ypsilanti make the two effectively a single urban area.

===Landscape===
The landscape of Ann Arbor consists of hills and valleys, with the terrain becoming steeper near the Huron River. The elevation ranges from about along the Huron River to on the city&#x27;s west side, near the intersection of Maple Road and Pauline Blvd. Ann Arbor Municipal Airport, which is south of the city at , has an elevation of . Ann Arbor is nicknamed &quot;Tree Town&quot;, both due to its name and to the dense forestation of its parks and residential areas. The city contains more than 50,000 trees along its streets and an equal number in parks. Into the early 2000s, the emerald ash borer has destroyed many of the city&#x27;s approximately 10,500 ash trees.

The city contains over 160 municipal parks ranging from small neighborhood green spots to large recreation areas such as Buhr Park. Several large city parks and a university park border sections of the Huron River. Fuller Recreation Area, near the University Hospital complex, contains sports fields, pedestrian and bike paths, and swimming pools. Opened in the summer of 2014, the city-funded Ann Arbor Skatepark is a skatepark located within Veterans Memorial Park. The city is also home to the Washtenaw County-owned County Farm Park. The Nichols Arboretum, owned by the University of Michigan, is a arboretum that contains hundreds of plant and tree species. It is on the city&#x27;s east side, near the university&#x27;s Central Campus. Located across the Huron River just beyond the university&#x27;s North Campus is the university&#x27;s Matthaei Botanical Gardens, which contains 300 acres of gardens and a large tropical conservatory. Several other green spaces around Ann Arbor are privately owned or owned by government agencies such as Ann Arbor Public Schools.

===Cityscape===

The cityscape of Ann Arbor is heavily influenced by the University of Michigan, with 22% of downtown and 9.4% of the total land owned by the university. The downtown Central Campus contains some of the oldest extant structures in the city—including the President&#x27;s House, built in 1840—and separates the South University District from the other three downtown commercial districts. These other three districts, Kerrytown, State Street, and Main Street are contiguous near the northwestern corner of the university.

Major landmarks in downtown Ann Arbor include the Michigan Theater, The Diag, and Tower Plaza, a 26-story condominium building that is the city&#x27;s tallest building. Downtown is also home to several Fairy Doors and other public art installations.

Three commercial areas south of downtown include the areas near I-94 and Ann Arbor-Saline Road, Briarwood Mall, and the South Industrial area. Other commercial areas include the Arborland/Washtenaw Avenue and Packard Road merchants on the east side, the Plymouth Road area in the northeast, and the Westgate/West Stadium areas on the west side. Downtown contains a mix of 19th- and early-20th-century structures and modern-style buildings, as well as a farmers&#x27; market in the Kerrytown district. The city&#x27;s commercial districts are composed mostly of two- to four-story structures, although downtown and the area near Briarwood Mall contain a small number of high-rise buildings.

Ann Arbor&#x27;s residential neighborhoods contain architectural styles ranging from classic 19th- and early 20th-century designs to ranch-style houses. Among these homes are a number of kit houses built in the early 20th century. Contemporary-style houses are farther from the downtown district. Surrounding the University of Michigan campus are houses and apartment complexes occupied primarily by student renters. The 19th-century buildings and streetscape of the Old West Side neighborhood have been preserved virtually intact; in 1972, the district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), and it is further protected by city ordinances and a nonprofit preservation group.

===Climate===
Ann Arbor has a typically Midwestern humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfa&quot;), which is influenced by the Great Lakes. There are four distinct seasons: winters are cold and snowy, with average highs around . Summers are warm to hot and humid, with average highs around and with slightly more precipitation. Spring and autumn are transitional between the two. The area experiences lake effect weather, primarily in the form of increased cloudiness during late fall and early winter. The monthly daily average temperature in July is , while the same figure for January is . Temperatures reach or exceed on 10 days, and drop to or below on 4.6 nights. Precipitation tends to be the heaviest during the summer months, but most frequent during winter. Snowfall, which normally occurs from November to April but occasionally starts in October, averages per season. The lowest recorded temperature was on February 11, 1885, and the highest recorded temperature was on July 24, 1934.

==Demographics==

Ann Arbor has seen consistent growth in population between all decennial censuses since 1860 with the exception of the 2010 census which reported almost no growth from the previous census. As of the 2020 U.S. census, there were 123,851 people and 49,337 households residing in the city, with a population density of .

Hispanic or Latino residents of any race made up 5.5% of the population. Ann Arbor has a small population of Arab Americans, including students as well as local Lebanese and Palestinians, and a large community of Japanese nationals.

According to the 2022 American Community Survey estimates, out of 49,337 households, 33.8% were married-couple households, 9.8% were cohabiting couple households, 26.1% had a male householder with no spouse present, and 30.4% had a female householder with no spouse present. 18.4% of the households had individuals under the age of 18 living in them, and 20.1% had individuals over age 65 living in them. The average household size was 2.22 people and the average family size was 2.78 people. The median age was 25.9; 12.2% of the population was under age 18, and 12.3% was age 65 or older. The percentage of city residents age 25 years or older with at least a high school degree was 97.8% while 77.5% had a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher, which is higher than the U.S. national percentage of 89.1% for persons age 25 years or older with at least a high school degree and 34.3% with a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher.

With a violent crime rate of 309.5 per 100,000 people, the city&#x27;s violent crime rate is lower than Michigan&#x27;s rate of 461 per 100,000 people and the U.S. national rate of 380.7 per 100,000 people. However, Ann Arbor&#x27;s property crime rate, at 1726.0 per 100,000 people, is higher than Michigan&#x27;s property crime rate of 1536.8 per 100,000 people and lower than the U.S. national property crime rate of 1954.4 per 100,000 people.

==Economy==
The University of Michigan shapes Ann Arbor&#x27;s economy significantly. It employs about 30,000 workers which includes about 12,000 in the medical center. Other employers are drawn to the area by the university&#x27;s research and development money, and by its graduates. High tech, health services and biotechnology are other major components of the city&#x27;s economy; numerous medical offices, laboratories, and associated companies are located in the city. Automobile manufacturers, such as General Motors and Visteon, also employ residents.

High tech companies have located in the area since the 1930s, when International Radio Corporation introduced the first mass-produced AC/DC radio (the Kadette, in 1931) as well as the first pocket radio (the Kadette Jr., in 1933). Current firms include Arbor Networks (provider of Internet traffic engineering and security systems), Arbortext (provider of XML-based publishing software), JSTOR (the digital scholarly journal archive), Truven Health Analytics, and ProQuest, which includes UMI. Duo Security, a cloud-based access security provider of two-factor authentication, is headquartered in Ann Arbor. It was formerly a unicorn and continues to be headquartered in Ann Arbor after its acquisition by Cisco Systems. In November 2021, semiconductor test equipment company KLA Corporation opened a new North American headquarters in Ann Arbor.
Ann Arbor is the home to Internet2 and the Merit Network, a not-for-profit research and education computer network. Both are located in the South State Commons 2 building on South State Street. The city is also home to a secondary office of Google&#x27;s AdWords program—the company&#x27;s primary revenue stream. As of 2022, Ann Arbor is home to more than twenty video game and XR studios of varying sizes. The city plays host to a regional chapter of the International Game Developers Association (IGDA) which hosts monthly meetups, presentations, and educational events.

The University of Michigan operates the North Campus Research Complex, a former Pfizer pharmaceutical research facility on the northeast side of Ann Arbor. The city is the home of other research and engineering centers, including the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory that is operated by NOAA and the Michigan Tech Research Institute. Other research centers sited in the city are the United States Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory and the Toyota Technical Center. The city is also home to National Sanitation Foundation International (NSF International), the nonprofit non-governmental organization that develops generally accepted standards for a variety of public health related industries and subject areas.
Non-high tech companies in Ann Arbor include Domino&#x27;s Pizza, headquartered on Domino&#x27;s Farms, a Frank Lloyd Wright-inspired complex just northeast of the city. Another Ann Arbor-based company is Zingerman&#x27;s Delicatessen, which serves sandwiches and has developed businesses under a variety of brand names. Avfuel, a global supplier of aviation fuels and services, is headquartered in Ann Arbor as is Pinkerton, a detective and private security firm. Many cooperative enterprises were founded in the city; among those that remain are the People&#x27;s Food Co-op and the Inter-Cooperative Council at the University of Michigan, a student housing cooperative founded in 1937. There are also three cohousing communities—Sunward, Great Oak, and Touchstone—located immediately to the west of the city limits.

==Culture==


Several performing arts groups and facilities are on the University of Michigan&#x27;s campus, as are museums dedicated to art, archaeology, and natural history and sciences. Founded in 1879, the University Musical Society is an independent performing arts organization that presents over 60 events each year, bringing international artists in music, dance, and theater. Since 2001 Shakespeare in the Arb has presented one play by Shakespeare each June, in a large park near downtown. Regional and local performing arts groups not associated with the university include the Ann Arbor Civic Theatre, the Arbor Opera Theater, the Ann Arbor Symphony Orchestra, The Ark, and Performance Network Theatre. State Theatre and the adjacent Michigan Theater are a movie palace and a performing arts center, respectively. Another unique piece of artistic expression in Ann Arbor is the fairy doors. These small portals are examples of installation art and can be found throughout the downtown area.

The Ann Arbor Hands-On Museum, an interactive science center, is located in a renovated and expanded historic downtown fire station. The Ann Arbor Art Center is a nonprofit that organizes art activities and exhibitions. Aside from the Ann Arbor District Library, which maintains four branch outlets in addition to its main downtown building, and being the home to the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library, Ann Arbor ranks first among U.S. cities in the number of booksellers and books sold per capita.
Several annual events—many of them centered on performing and visual arts—draw visitors to Ann Arbor. One such event is the Ann Arbor Art Fairs, a set of four concurrent juried fairs held on downtown streets. Scheduled on Thursday through Sunday of the third week of July, the fairs draw upward of half a million visitors. Another is the Ann Arbor Film Festival, held during the third week of March, which receives more than 2,500 submissions annually from more than 40 countries and serves as one of a handful of Academy Award–qualifying festivals in the United States.

Ann Arbor has a long history of openness to marijuana, given Ann Arbor&#x27;s decriminalization of cannabis, the large number of medical marijuana dispensaries in the city (one dispensary, called People&#x27;s Co-op, was directly across the street from Michigan Stadium until zoning forced it to move one mile to the west), the large number of pro-marijuana residents, and the annual Hash Bash: an event that is held on the first Saturday of April. Until (at least) the successful passage of Michigan&#x27;s medical marijuana law, the event had arguably strayed from its initial intent, although for years, a number of attendees have received serious legal responses due to marijuana use on University of Michigan property, which does not fall under the city&#x27;s progressive and compassionate ticketing program.
A person from Ann Arbor is called an &quot;Ann Arborite&quot;, and many long-time residents call themselves &quot;townies&quot;. The city itself is often called &quot;A²&quot; (&quot;A-squared&quot;) or &quot;A2&quot; (&quot;A two&quot;) or &quot;AA&quot;, &quot;The Deuce&quot; (mainly by Chicagoans), and &quot;Tree Town&quot;. With tongue-in-cheek reference to the city&#x27;s liberal political leanings, some occasionally refer to Ann Arbor as &quot;The People&#x27;s Republic of Ann Arbor&quot; or &quot;25 square miles surrounded by reality.&quot; In &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; broadcast from Ann Arbor, Garrison Keillor described Ann Arbor as &quot;a city where people discuss socialism, but only in the fanciest restaurants.&quot; Ann Arbor sometimes appears on citation indexes as an author, instead of a location, often with the academic degree &quot;MI&quot;, a misunderstanding of the abbreviation for Michigan.

==Sports==
Ann Arbor is a major center for college sports, most notably at the University of Michigan. Several well-known college sports facilities exist in the city, including Michigan Stadium, the largest American football stadium and the third-largest stadium of any kind in the world with a capacity of 107,601. The stadium is colloquially known as &quot;The Big House&quot; due to its status as the largest American football stadium. Crisler Center and Yost Ice Arena play host to the school&#x27;s basketball (both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s) and ice hockey teams, respectively. Concordia University, a member of the NAIA, also fields sports teams.

In semi-professional sports Ann Arbor is represented in the NPSL by AFC Ann Arbor, a soccer club founded in 2014 who call themselves The Mighty Oak.

==Government==
As the county seat of Washtenaw County, the Washtenaw County Trial Court (22nd Circuit Court) is located in Ann Arbor at the Washtenaw County Courthouse on Main Street. Seven judges serve on the court. The 15th Michigan district court, which serves only the city itself, is located within the Ann Arbor Justice Center, immediately next to city hall. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan and Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit are also located in downtown Ann Arbor, at the federal building on Liberty Street.

In the Michigan Legislature, the city is split between Districts 23, 33, 47, and 48 in the Michigan House of Representatives. In the Michigan Senate, Ann Arbor is covered by Districts 14 and 15. Ann Arbor is within the 6th congressional district, currently represented by Debbie Dingell.
Ann Arbor has a council-manager form of government, with 11 voting members: the mayor and 10 city council members. Each of the city&#x27;s five wards are represented by two council members, with the mayor elected at-large during midterm years. Half of the council members are elected in midterm years, with the other in general election years. The mayor is the presiding officer of the city council and has the power to appoint all council committee members as well as board and commission members, with the approval of the city council. The current mayor of Ann Arbor is Christopher Taylor, a Democrat who was elected as mayor in 2014. Day-to-day city operations are managed by a city administrator chosen by the city council. While Democrats, as of 2024, hold the mayorship and all ten council seats, Ann Arbor has two major political factions. A major source of this local divide is differences in views on the city&#x27;s growth.
==Education==
===Primary and secondary education===

Public schools are part of the Ann Arbor Public Schools (AAPS) district. AAPS has one of the country&#x27;s leading music programs. For the 2021–2022 school year, 17,070 students were enrolled in the Ann Arbor Public Schools. Notable schools include Pioneer, Huron, Skyline, Community high schools, Pathways to Success Academic Campus, and Ann Arbor Open School. The district has a preschool center with both free and tuition-based programs for preschoolers in the district. The University High School, a &quot;demonstration school&quot; with teachers drawn from the University of Michigan&#x27;s education program, was part of the school system from 1924 to 1968.

Ann Arbor is home to several private schools, including Emerson School, the Father Gabriel Richard High School, Rudolf Steiner School of Ann Arbor (a PreK–12 Waldorf school), Clonlara School, Michigan Islamic Academy, and Greenhills School, a prep school. The city is also home to several charter schools such as Central Academy (Michigan) (PreK–12) of the Global Educational Excellence (GEE) charter school company, Washtenaw Technical Middle College, and Honey Creek Community School.

===Higher education===
The University of Michigan dominates the city of Ann Arbor, providing the city with its distinctive college-town character. University buildings are located in the center of the city and the campus is directly adjacent to the State Street and South University downtown areas.

Other local colleges and universities include Concordia University Ann Arbor, a Lutheran liberal-arts institution, and Cleary University, a private business school. Washtenaw Community College is located in neighboring Ann Arbor Township. In 2000, the Ave Maria School of Law, a Roman Catholic law school established by Domino&#x27;s Pizza founder Tom Monaghan, opened in northeastern Ann Arbor, but the school moved to Ave Maria, Florida in 2009, and the Thomas M. Cooley Law School acquired the former Ave Maria buildings for use as a branch campus.

==Media==
&quot;The Ann Arbor News&quot;, owned by the Michigan-based Booth Newspapers chain, was the major newspaper serving Ann Arbor and the rest of Washtenaw County. The newspaper ended its 174-year daily print run in 2009 due to economic difficulties, and began producing two printed editions a week under the name AnnArbor.com. Ann Arbor has been said to be the first significant city to lose its only daily paper. The publication resumed using its former name in 2013, and also produces a daily digital edition named MLive.com. Another Ann Arbor-based publication that has ceased production was the &quot;Ann Arbor Paper&quot;, a free monthly. The &quot;Ann Arbor Chronicle&quot;, an online newspaper, covered local news, including meetings of the library board, county commission, and DDA until September 3, 2014.

Current publications in the city include the &quot;Ann Arbor Journal&quot; (&quot;A2 Journal&quot;), a weekly community newspaper; the &quot;Ann Arbor Observer&quot;, a free monthly local magazine; and &quot;Current&quot;, a free entertainment-focused alt-weekly. The &quot;Ann Arbor Business Review&quot; covers local business in the area. &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine and &quot;Automobile Magazine&quot; are also based in Ann Arbor. The University of Michigan is served by many student publications, including the independent &quot;Michigan Daily&quot; student newspaper, which reports on local, state, and regional issues in addition to campus news.

Four major AM radio stations based in or near Ann Arbor are WAAM 1600, a conservative news and talk station; WLBY 1290, a business news and talk station; WDEO 990, Catholic radio; and WTKA 1050, which is primarily a sports station. The city&#x27;s FM stations include NPR affiliate WUOM 91.7; country station WWWW 102.9; and adult-alternative station WQKL 107.1. Freeform station WCBN-FM 88.3 is a local community radio/college radio station operated by the students of the University of Michigan featuring noncommercial, eclectic music and public-affairs programming. The city is also served by public and commercial radio broadcasters in Ypsilanti, the Lansing/Jackson area, Detroit, Windsor, and Toledo.

Ann Arbor is part of the Detroit television market. WPXD channel 31, the owned-and-operated Detroit outlet of the ION Television network, is licensed to the city. Until its sign-off on August 31, 2017, WHTV channel 18, a MyNetworkTV-affiliated station for the Lansing market, was broadcast from a transmitter in Lyndon Township, west of Ann Arbor. Community Television Network (CTN) is a city-provided cable television channel with production facilities open to city residents and nonprofit organizations. Detroit and Toledo-area radio and television stations also serve Ann Arbor, and stations from Lansing and Windsor, Ontario, can be seen in parts of the area.

==Infrastructure==
===Healthcare===

The University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) includes University Hospital, C.S. Mott Children&#x27;s Hospital and Women&#x27;s Hospital in its core complex. UMHS also operates out-patient clinics and facilities throughout the city. The area&#x27;s other major medical centers include a large facility operated by the Department of Veterans Affairs in Ann Arbor, and Saint Joseph Mercy Hospital in nearby Superior Township.

===Utilities===
The city provides sewage disposal and water supply services, with water coming from the Huron River and groundwater sources. There are two water-treatment plants, one main and three outlying reservoirs, four pump stations, and two water towers. These facilities serve the city, which is divided into five water districts. The city&#x27;s water department also operates four dams along the Huron River—Argo, Barton, Geddes, and Superior—of which Barton and Superior provide hydroelectric power.

The city also offers waste management services, with Recycle Ann Arbor handling recycling service. Other utilities are provided by private entities. Electrical power and gas are provided by DTE Energy. AT&amp;T Inc. is the primary wired telephone service provider for the area. Cable TV service is primarily provided by Comcast.

===Transportation===

The streets in downtown Ann Arbor conform to a grid pattern, though this pattern is less common in the surrounding areas. Major roads branch out from the downtown district to the highways surrounding the city. The city is belted by three freeways: I-94, which runs along the southern and western portion of the city; U.S. Highway 23 (US 23), which primarily runs along the eastern edge of Ann Arbor; and M-14, which runs along the northern edge of the city. Other nearby highways include US 12 (Michigan Ave.), M-17 (Washtenaw Ave.), and M-153 (Ford Rd.). Several of the major surface arteries lead to the I-94/M-14 interchange in the west, US 23 in the east, and the city&#x27;s southern areas. The Washtenaw County Border-to-Border Trail connects Ann Arbor to Ypsilanti, mostly along the Huron River, for pedestrians, bicycles and other non-motorized transportation.
The Ann Arbor Area Transportation Authority (AAATA), which brands itself as &quot;TheRide&quot;, operates public bus services throughout the city and nearby Ypsilanti. The AAATA operates the Blake Transit Center on Fourth Ave. in downtown Ann Arbor, and the Ypsilanti Transit Center. A separate zero-fare bus service operates within and between the University of Michigan campuses. In 2019, 36% of trips in Ann Arbor were taken by walking, biking or transit.

Since April 2012, the &quot;AirRide&quot; connects to Detroit Metro Airport a dozen times a day. Greyhound Lines provides intercity bus service. The Michigan Flyer, a service operated by Indian Trails, cooperates with AAATA for their AirRide and additionally offers bus service to East Lansing. Megabus has direct service to Chicago, Illinois, while a bus service is provided by Amtrak Thruway for rail passengers making connections to services in East Lansing and Toledo, Ohio.

Amtrak, which provides service to the city at the Ann Arbor Train Station, operates the &quot;Wolverine&quot; train between Chicago and Pontiac via Detroit. The present-day train station neighbors the city&#x27;s old Michigan Central Depot, which was renovated as a restaurant in 1970. Ann Arbor Municipal Airport is a small, city-run general aviation airport located south of I-94.
