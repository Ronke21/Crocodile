<text>AppleTalk is a discontinued proprietary suite of networking protocols developed by Apple Computer for their Macintosh computers. AppleTalk includes a number of features that allow local area networks to be connected with no prior setup or the need for a centralized router or server of any sort. Connected AppleTalk-equipped systems automatically assign addresses, update the distributed namespace, and configure any required inter-networking routing.

AppleTalk was released in 1985 and was the primary protocol used by Apple devices through the 1980s and 1990s. Versions were also released for the IBM PC and compatibles and the Apple IIGS. AppleTalk support was also available in most networked printers (especially laser printers), some file servers, and a number of routers.

The rise of TCP/IP during the 1990s led to a reimplementation of most of these types of support on that protocol, and AppleTalk became unsupported as of the release of Mac OS X v10.6 in 2009. Many of AppleTalk&#x27;s more advanced autoconfiguration features have since been introduced in Bonjour, while Universal Plug and Play serves similar needs.

==History==

===AppleNet===
After the release of the Apple Lisa computer in January 1983, Apple invested considerable effort in the development of a local area networking (LAN) system for the machines. Known as AppleNet, it was based on the seminal Xerox XNS protocol stack but running on a custom 1 Mbit/s coaxial cable system rather than Xerox&#x27;s 2.94 Mbit/s Ethernet. AppleNet was announced early in 1983 with a full introduction at the target price of $500 for plug-in AppleNet cards for the Lisa and the Apple II.

At that time, early LAN systems were just coming to market, including Ethernet, Token Ring, Econet, and ARCNET. This was a topic of major commercial effort at the time, dominating shows like the National Computer Conference (NCC) in Anaheim in May 1983. All of the systems were jockeying for position in the market, but even at this time, Ethernet&#x27;s widespread acceptance suggested it was to become a &quot;de facto&quot; standard. It was at this show that Steve Jobs asked Gursharan Sidhu a seemingly innocuous question: &quot;Why has networking not caught on?&quot;

Four months later, in October, AppleNet was cancelled. At the time, they announced that &quot;Apple realized that it&#x27;s not in the business to create a networking system. We built and used AppleNet in-house, but we realized that if we had shipped it, we would have seen new standards coming up.&quot; In January, Jobs announced that they would instead be supporting IBM&#x27;s Token Ring, which he expected to come out in a &quot;few months&quot;.

===AppleBus===
Through this period, Apple was deep in development of the Macintosh computer. During development, engineers had made the decision to use the Zilog 8530 serial controller chip (SCC) instead of the lower-cost and more common UART to provide serial port connections. The SCC cost about $5 more than a UART, but offered much higher speeds of up to 250 kilobits per second (or higher with additional hardware) and internally supported a number of basic networking-like protocols like IBM&#x27;s Bisync.

The SCC was chosen because it would allow multiple devices to be attached to the port. Peripherals equipped with similar SCCs could communicate using the built-in protocols, interleaving their data with other peripherals on the same bus. This would eliminate the need for more ports on the back of the machine, and allowed for the elimination of expansion slots for supporting more complex devices. The initial concept was known as AppleBus, envisioning a system controlled by the host Macintosh polling &quot;dumb&quot; devices in a fashion similar to the modern Universal Serial Bus.

===AppleBus networking===
The Macintosh team had already begun work on what would become the LaserWriter and had considered a number of other options to answer the question of how to share these expensive machines and other resources. A series of memos from Bob Belleville clarified these concepts, outlining the Mac, LaserWriter, and a file server system which would become the Macintosh Office. By late 1983 it was clear that IBM&#x27;s Token Ring would not be ready in time for the launch of the Mac, and might miss the launch of these other products as well. In the end, Token Ring would not ship until October 1985.

Jobs&#x27; earlier question to Sidhu had already sparked a number of ideas. When AppleNet was cancelled in October, Sidhu led an effort to develop a new networking system based on the AppleBus hardware. This new system would not have to conform to any existing preconceptions, and was designed to be worthy of the Mac – a system that was user-installable and required no configuration or fixed network addresses – in short, a true plug-and-play network. Considerable effort was needed, but by the time the Mac was released, the basic concepts had been outlined, and some of the low-level protocols were on their way to completion. Sidhu mentioned the work to Belleville only two hours after the Mac was announced.

The &quot;new&quot; AppleBus was announced in early 1984, allowing direct connection from the Mac or Lisa through a small box that is plugged into the serial port and connected via cables to the next computer upstream and downstream. Adaptors for Apple II and Apple III were also announced. Apple also announced that an AppleBus network could be attached to, and would appear to be a single node within, a Token Ring system. Details of how this would work were sketchy.

===AppleTalk Personal Network===
Just prior to its release in early 1985, AppleBus was renamed AppleTalk. Initially marketed as AppleTalk Personal Network, it comprised a family of network protocols and a physical layer.

The physical layer had a number of limitations, including a speed of only 230.4 kbit/s, a maximum distance of from end to end, and only 32 nodes per LAN. But as the basic hardware was built into the Mac, adding nodes only cost about $50 for the adaptor box. In comparison, Ethernet or Token Ring cards cost hundreds or thousands of dollars. Additionally, the entire networking stack required only about 6 kB of RAM, allowing it to run on any Mac.

The relatively slow speed of AppleTalk allowed further reductions in cost. Instead of using RS-422&#x27;s balanced transmit and receive circuits, the AppleTalk cabling used a single common electrical ground, which limited speeds to about 500 kbit/s, but allowed one conductor to be removed. This meant that common three-conductor cables could be used for wiring. Additionally, the adaptors were designed to be &quot;self-terminating&quot;, meaning that nodes at the end of the network could simply leave their last connector unconnected. There was no need for the wires to be connected back together into a loop, nor the need for hubs or other devices.

The system was designed for future expansion; the addressing system allowed for expansion to 255 nodes in a LAN (although only 32 could be used at that time), and by using &quot;bridges&quot; (which came to be known as &quot;routers&quot;, although technically not the same) one could interconnect LANs into larger collections. &quot;Zones&quot; allowed devices to be addressed within a bridge-connected internet. Additionally, AppleTalk was designed from the start to allow use with any potential underlying physical link, and within a few years, the physical layer would be renamed LocalTalk, so as to differentiate it from the AppleTalk protocols.

The main advantage of AppleTalk was that it was completely maintenance-free. To join a device to a network, a user simply plugged the adaptor into the machine, then connected a cable from it to any free port on any other adaptor. The AppleTalk network stack negotiated a network address, assigned the computer a human-readable name, and compiled a list of the names and types of other machines on the network so the user could browse the devices through the Chooser. AppleTalk was so easy to use that ad hoc networks tended to appear whenever multiple Macs were in the same room. Apple would later use this in an advertisement showing a network being created between two seats in an airplane.

===PhoneNet and other adaptors===
A thriving third-party market for AppleTalk devices developed over the next few years. One particularly notable example was an alternate adaptor designed by BMUG and commercialised by Farallon as PhoneNET in 1987. This was essentially a replacement for Apple&#x27;s connector that had conventional phone jacks instead of Apple&#x27;s round connectors. PhoneNet allowed AppleTalk networks to be connected together using normal telephone wires, and with very little extra work, could run analog phones and AppleTalk on a single four-conductor phone cable.

Other companies took advantage of the SCC&#x27;s ability to read external clocks in order to support higher transmission speeds, up to 1 Mbit/s. In these systems, the external adaptor also included its own clock, and used that to signal the SCC&#x27;s clock input pins. The best-known such system was Centram&#x27;s FlashTalk, which ran at 768 kbit/s, and was intended to be used with their TOPS networking system. A similar solution was the 850 kbit/s DaynaTalk, which used a separate box that plugged in between the computer and a normal LocalTalk/PhoneNet box. Dayna also offered a PC expansion card that ran up to 1.7 Mbit/s when talking to other Dayna PC cards. Several other systems also existed with even higher performance, but these often required special cabling that was incompatible with LocalTalk/PhoneNet, and also required patches to the networking stack that often caused problems.

=== AppleTalk over Ethernet ===
As Apple expanded into more commercial and education markets, they needed to integrate AppleTalk into existing network installations. Many of these organisations had already invested in a very expensive Ethernet infrastructure and there was no direct way to connect a Macintosh to Ethernet. AppleTalk included a protocol structure for interconnecting AppleTalk subnets and so as a solution, EtherTalk was initially created to use the Ethernet as a backbone between LocalTalk subnets. To accomplish this, organizations would need to purchase a LocalTalk-to-Ethernet bridge and Apple left it to third parties to produce these products. A number of companies responded, including Hayes and a few newly formed companies like Kinetics.

=== LocalTalk, EtherTalk, TokenTalk, and AppleShare ===
By 1987, Ethernet was clearly winning the standards battle over Token Ring, and in the middle of that year, Apple introduced EtherTalk 1.0, an implementation of the AppleTalk protocol over the Ethernet physical layer. Introduced for the newly released Macintosh II computer, one of Apple&#x27;s first two Macintoshes with expansion slots (the Macintosh SE had one slot of a different type), the operating system included a new Network control panel that allowed the user to select which physical connection to use for networking (from &quot;Built-in&quot; or &quot;EtherTalk&quot;). At introduction, Ethernet interface cards were available from 3Com and Kinetics that plugged into a Nubus slot in the machine. The new networking stack also expanded the system to allow a full 255 nodes per LAN. With EtherTalk&#x27;s release, AppleTalk Personal Network was renamed LocalTalk, the name it would be known under for the bulk of its life. Token Ring would later be supported with a similar TokenTalk product, which used the same Network control panel and underlying software. Over time, many third-party companies would introduce compatible Ethernet and Token Ring cards that used these same drivers.

The appearance of a Macintosh with a direct Ethernet connection also magnified the Ethernet and LocalTalk compatibility problem: Networks with new and old Macs needed some way to communicate with each other. This could be as simple as a network of Ethernet Mac II&#x27;s trying to talk to a LaserWriter that only connected to LocalTalk. Apple initially relied on the aforementioned LocalTalk-to-Ethernet bridge products, but contrary to Apple&#x27;s belief that these would be low-volume products, by the end of 1987, 130,000 such networks were in use. AppleTalk was at that time the most used networking system in the world, with over three times the installations of any other vendor.

1987 also marked the introduction of the AppleShare product, a dedicated file server that ran on any Mac with 512 kB of RAM or more. A common AppleShare machine was the Mac Plus with an external SCSI hard drive. AppleShare was the #3 network operating system in the late 1980s, behind Novell NetWare and Microsoft&#x27;s MS-Net. AppleShare was effectively the replacement for the failed Macintosh Office efforts, which had been based on a dedicated file server device.

===AppleTalk Phase II and other developments===
A significant re-design was released in 1989 as AppleTalk Phase II. In many ways, Phase II can be considered an effort to make the earlier version (never called Phase I) more generic. LANs could now support more than 255 nodes, and zones were no longer associated with physical networks but were entirely virtual constructs used simply to organize nodes. For instance, one could now make a &quot;Printers&quot; zone that would list all the printers in an organization, or one might want to place that same device in the &quot;2nd Floor&quot; zone to indicate its physical location. Phase II also included changes to the underlying inter-networking protocols to make them less &quot;chatty&quot;, which had previously been a serious problem on networks that bridged over wide-area networks.

By this point, Apple had a wide variety of communications products under development, and many of these were announced along with AppleTalk Phase II. These included updates to EtherTalk and TokenTalk, AppleTalk software and LocalTalk hardware for the IBM PC, EtherTalk for Apple&#x27;s A/UX operating system allowing it to use LaserWriters and other network resources, and the Mac X.25 and MacX products.

Ethernet had become almost universal by 1990, and it was time to build Ethernet into Macs direct from the factory. However, the physical wiring used by these networks was not yet completely standardized. Apple solved this problem using a single port on the back of the computer into which the user could plug an adaptor for any given cabling system. This FriendlyNet system was based on the industry-standard Attachment Unit Interface or AUI, but deliberately chose a non-standard connector that was smaller and easier to use, which they called &quot;Apple AUI&quot;, or AAUI. FriendlyNet was first introduced on the Quadra 700 and Quadra 900 computers, and used across much of the Mac line for some time. As with LocalTalk, a number of third-party FriendlyNet adaptors quickly appeared.

As 10BASE-T became the de facto cabling system for Ethernet, second-generation Power Macintosh machines added a 10BASE-T port in addition to AAUI. The PowerBook 3400c and lower-end Power Macs also added 10BASE-T. The Power Macintosh 7300/8600/9600 were the final Macs to include AAUI, and 10BASE-T became universal starting with the Power Macintosh G3 and PowerBook G3.

===The capital-I Internet===
From the beginning of AppleTalk, users wanted to connect the Macintosh to TCP/IP network environments. In 1984, Bill Croft at Stanford University pioneered the development of IP packets encapsulated in DDP as part of the SEAGATE (Stanford Ethernet–AppleTalk Gateway) project. SEAGATE was commercialized by Kinetics in their LocalTalk-to-Ethernet bridge as an additional routing option. A few years later, MacIP was separated from the SEAGATE code and became the de facto method for IP packets to be routed over LocalTalk networks. By 1986, Columbia University released the first version of the Columbia AppleTalk Package (CAP) that allowed higher integration of Unix, TCP/IP, and AppleTalk environments. In 1988, Apple released MacTCP, a system that allowed the Mac to support TCP/IP on machines with suitable Ethernet hardware. However, this left many universities with the problem of supporting IP on their many LocalTalk-equipped Macs. It was soon common to include MacIP support in LocalTalk-to-Ethernet bridges. MacTCP would not become a standard part of the Classic Mac OS until 1994, by which time it also supported SNMP and PPP.

For some time in the early 1990s, the Mac was a primary client on the rapidly expanding Internet. Among the better-known programs in wide use were Fetch, Eudora, eXodus, NewsWatcher, and the NCSA packages, especially NCSA Mosaic and its offspring, Netscape Navigator. Additionally, a number of server products appeared that allowed the Mac to host Internet content. Through this period, Macs had about 2 to 3 times as many clients connected to the Internet as any other platform, despite the relatively small overall microcomputer market share.

As the world quickly moved to IP for both LAN and WAN uses, Apple was faced with maintaining two increasingly outdated code bases on an ever-wider group of machines as well as the introduction of the PowerPC-based machines. This led to the Open Transport efforts, which re-implemented both MacTCP and AppleTalk on an entirely new code base adapted from the Unix standard STREAMS. Early versions had problems and did not become stable for some time. By that point, Apple was deep in their ultimately doomed Copland efforts.

===Legacy and abandonment===
With the purchase of NeXT and subsequent development of Mac OS X, AppleTalk was strictly a legacy system. Support was added to Mac OS X in order to provide support for a large number of existing AppleTalk devices, notably laser printers and file shares, but alternate connection solutions common in this era, notably USB for printers, limited their demand. As Apple abandoned many of these product categories, and all new systems were based on IP, AppleTalk became less and less common. AppleTalk support was finally removed from the macOS line in Mac OS X v10.6 in 2009.

However, the loss of AppleTalk did not reduce the desire for networking solutions that combined its ease of use with IP routing. Apple has led the development of many such efforts, from the introduction of the AirPort router to the development of the zero-configuration networking system and their implementation of it, Rendezvous, later renamed &quot;Bonjour&quot;.

As of 2020, AppleTalk support has been completely removed from legacy support with macOS 11 Big Sur.

== Design ==
The AppleTalk design rigorously followed the OSI model of protocol layering. Unlike most of the early LAN systems, AppleTalk was not built using the archetypal Xerox XNS system. The intended target was not Ethernet, and it did not have 48-bit addresses to route. Nevertheless, many portions of the AppleTalk system have direct analogs in XNS.

One key differentiation for AppleTalk was it contained two protocols aimed at making the system completely self-configuring. The &quot;AppleTalk address resolution protocol&quot; (&quot;AARP&quot;) allowed AppleTalk hosts to automatically generate their own network addresses, and the &quot;Name Binding Protocol&quot; (&quot;NBP&quot;) was a dynamic system for mapping network addresses to user-readable names. Although systems similar to AARP existed in other systems, Banyan VINES for instance. Beginning about 2002 Rendezvous (the combination of DNS-based service discovery, Multicast DNS, and link-local addressing) provided capabilities and usability using IP that were similar to those of AppleTalk.

Both AARP and NBP had defined ways to allow &quot;controller&quot; devices to override the default mechanisms. The concept was to allow routers to provide the information or &quot;hardwire&quot; the system to known addresses and names. On larger networks where AARP could cause problems as new nodes searched for free addresses, the addition of a router could reduce &quot;chattiness.&quot; Together AARP and NBP made AppleTalk an easy-to-use networking system. New machines were added to the network by plugging them in and optionally giving them a name. The NBP lists were examined and displayed by a program known as the &quot;Chooser&quot; which would display a list of machines on the local network, divided into classes such as file-servers and printers.

== Addressing ==
An AppleTalk address was a four-byte quantity. This consisted of a two-byte network number, a one-byte node number, and a one-byte socket number. Of these, only the network number required any configuration, being obtained from a router. Each node dynamically chose its own node number, according to a protocol (originally the LocalTalk Link Access Protocol LLAP and later, for Ethernet/EtherTalk, the AppleTalk Address Resolution Protocol, AARP) which handled contention between different nodes accidentally choosing the same number. For socket numbers, a few well-known numbers were reserved for special purposes specific to the AppleTalk protocol itself. Apart from these, all application-level protocols were expected to use dynamically assigned socket numbers at both the client and server end.

Because of this dynamism, users could not be expected to access services by specifying their address. Instead, all services had &quot;names&quot; which, being chosen by humans, could be expected to be meaningful to users, and also could be sufficiently long to minimize the chance of conflicts.

As NBP names translated to an address, which included a socket number as well as a node number, a name in AppleTalk mapped directly to a &quot;service&quot; being provided by a machine, which was entirely separate from the name of the machine itself. Thus, services could be moved to a different machine and, so long as they kept the same service name, there was no need for users to do anything different in order to continue accessing the service. And the same machine could host any number of instances of services of the same type, without any network connection conflicts.

Contrast this with &quot;A records&quot; in the DNS, in which a name translates to a machine&#x27;s address, not including the port number that might be providing a service. Thus, if people are accustomed to using a particular machine name to access a particular service, their access will break when the service is moved to a different machine. This can be mitigated somewhat by insistence on using &quot;CNAME records&quot; indicating service rather than actual machine names to refer to the service, but there is no way of guaranteeing that users will follow such a convention. Some newer protocols, such as Kerberos and Active Directory use DNS SRV records to identify services by name, which is much closer to the AppleTalk model.

== Protocols ==
=== AppleTalk Address Resolution Protocol ===
The AppleTalk Address Resolution Protocol (AARP) resolves AppleTalk addresses to link layer addresses. It is functionally equivalent to ARP and obtains address resolution by a method very similar to ARP.

AARP is a fairly simple system. When powered on, an AppleTalk machine broadcasts an &quot;AARP probe packet&quot; asking for a network address, intending to hear back from controllers such as routers. If no address is provided, one is picked at random from the &quot;base subnet&quot;, 0. It then broadcasts another packet saying &quot;I am selecting this address&quot;, and then waits to see if anyone else on the network complains. If another machine has that address, the newly connecting machine will pick another address, and keep trying until it finds a free one. On a network with many machines it may take several tries before a free address is found, so for performance purposes the successful address is recorded in NVRAM and used as the default address in the future. This means that in most real-world setups where machines are added a few at a time, only one or two tries are needed before the address effectively becomes constant.

=== AppleTalk Data Stream Protocol ===
The AppleTalk Data Stream Protocol (ADSP) was a comparatively late addition to the AppleTalk protocol suite, done when it became clear that a TCP-style reliable connection-oriented transport was needed. Significant differences from TCP were that:
* A connection attempt could be rejected.
* There were no &quot;half-open&quot; connections; once one end initiated a tear-down of the connection, the whole connection would be closed (&quot;i.e.&quot;, ADSP is full-duplex, not dual simplex).
* AppleTalk had an included attention message system which allowed short messages to be sent which would bypass the normal stream data flow. These were delivered reliably but out of order with respect to the stream. Any attention message would be delivered as soon as possible instead of waiting for the current stream byte sequence point to become current.

=== Apple Filing Protocol ===
The Apple Filing Protocol (AFP), formerly AppleTalk Filing Protocol, is the protocol for communicating with AppleShare file servers. Built on top of AppleTalk Session Protocol (for legacy AFP over DDP) or the Data Stream Interface (for AFP over TCP), it provides services for authenticating users (extensible to different authentication methods including two-way random-number exchange) and for performing operations specific to the Macintosh HFS filesystem. AFP is still in use in macOS, even though most other AppleTalk protocols have been deprecated.

=== AppleTalk Session Protocol ===
The AppleTalk Session Protocol (ASP) was an intermediate protocol, built on top of AppleTalk Transaction Protocol (ATP), which in turn was the foundation of AFP. It provided basic services for requesting responses to arbitrary &quot;commands&quot; and performing out-of-band status queries. It also allowed the server to send asynchronous &quot;attention&quot; messages to the client.

=== AppleTalk Transaction Protocol ===
The AppleTalk Transaction Protocol (ATP) was the original reliable transport-level protocol for AppleTalk, built on top of DDP. At the time it was being developed, a full, reliable connection-oriented protocol like TCP was considered to be too expensive to implement for most of the intended uses of AppleTalk. Thus, ATP was a simple request/response exchange, with no need to set up or tear down connections.

An ATP &quot;request&quot; packet could be answered by up to eight &quot;response&quot; packets. The requestor then sent an &quot;acknowledgement&quot; packet containing a bit mask indicating which of the response packets it received, so the responder could retransmit the remainder.

ATP could operate in either &quot;at-least-once&quot; mode or &quot;exactly-once&quot; mode. Exactly-once mode was essential for operations which were not idempotent; in this mode, the responder kept a copy of the response buffers in memory until successful receipt of a &quot;release&quot; packet from the requestor, or until a timeout elapsed. This way, it could respond to duplicate requests with the same transaction ID by resending the same response data, without performing the actual operation again.

=== Datagram Delivery Protocol ===
The Datagram Delivery Protocol (DDP) was the lowest-level data-link-independent transport protocol. It provided a datagram service with no guarantees of delivery. All application-level protocols, including the infrastructure protocols NBP, RTMP and ZIP, were built on top of DDP. AppleTalk&#x27;s DDP corresponds closely to the Network layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) communication model.

=== Name Binding Protocol ===
The Name Binding Protocol (NBP) was a dynamic, distributed system for managing AppleTalk names. When a service started up on a machine, it registered a name for itself as chosen by a human administrator. At this point, NBP provided a system for checking that no other machine had already registered the same name. Later, when a client wanted to access that service, it used NBP to query machines to find that service. NBP provided browsability (&quot;what are the names of all the services available?&quot;) as well as the ability to find a service with a particular name. Names were human-readable, containing spaces and upper- and lower-case letters, and including support for searching.

===AppleTalk Echo Protocol===
The AppleTalk Echo Protocol (AEP) was a transport layer protocol designed to test the reachability of network nodes. AEP generates packets to be sent to the network node and is identified in the Type field of a packet as an AEP packet. The packet is first passed to the source DDP. After it is identified as an AEP packet, it is forwarded to the node where the packet is examined by the DDP at the destination. After the packet is identified as an AEP packet, the packet is then copied and a field in the packet is altered to create an AEP reply packet, and is then returned to the source node.

=== Printer Access Protocol ===
The Printer Access Protocol (PAP) was the standard way of communicating with PostScript printers. It was built on top of ATP. When a PAP connection was opened, each end sent the other an ATP request which basically meant &quot;send me more data&quot;. The client&#x27;s response to the server was to send a block of PostScript code, while the server could respond with any diagnostic messages that might be generated as a result, after which another &quot;send-more-data&quot; request was sent. This use of ATP provided automatic flow control; each end could only send data to the other end if there was an outstanding ATP request to respond to.

PAP also provided for out-of-band status queries, handled by separate ATP transactions. Even while it was busy servicing a print job from one client, a PAP server could continue to respond to status requests from any number of other clients. This allowed other Macintoshes on the LAN that were waiting to print to display status messages indicating that the printer was busy, and what the job was that it was busy with.

=== Routing Table Maintenance Protocol ===
The Routing Table Maintenance Protocol (RTMP) was the protocol by which routers kept each other informed about the topology of the network. This was the only part of AppleTalk that required periodic unsolicited broadcasts: every 10 seconds, each router had to send out a list of all the network numbers it knew about and how far away it thought they were.

=== Zone Information Protocol ===
The Zone Information Protocol (ZIP) was the protocol by which AppleTalk network numbers were associated with zone names. A &quot;zone&quot; was a subdivision of the network that made sense to humans (for example, &quot;Accounting Department&quot;); but while a network number had to be assigned to a topologically contiguous section of the network, a zone could include several different discontiguous portions of the network.

== Physical implementation ==
The initial default hardware implementation for AppleTalk was a high-speed serial protocol known as &quot;LocalTalk&quot; that used the Macintosh&#x27;s built-in RS-422 ports at 230.4 kbit/s. LocalTalk used a splitter box in the RS-422 port to provide an upstream and downstream cable from a single port. The topology was a bus: cables were daisy-chained from each connected machine to the next, up to the maximum of 32 permitted on any LocalTalk segment. The system was slow by today&#x27;s standards, but at the time the additional cost and complexity of networking on PC machines was such that it was common that Macs were the only networked personal computers in an office. Other larger computers, such as UNIX or VAX workstations, would commonly be networked via Ethernet.

Other physical implementations were also available. A very popular replacement for LocalTalk was &quot;PhoneNET&quot;, a third-party solution from Farallon Computing, Inc. (renamed Netopia, acquired by Motorola in 2007) that also used the RS-422 port and was indistinguishable from LocalTalk as far as Apple&#x27;s LocalTalk port drivers were concerned, but ran over very inexpensive standard phone cabling with four-wire, six-position modular connectors, the same cables used to connect landline telephones. Since it used the second pair of wires, network devices could even be connected through existing telephone jacks if a second line was not present. Foreshadowing today&#x27;s network hubs and switches, Farallon provided solutions for PhoneNet to be used in &quot;star&quot; as well as &quot;bus&quot; configurations, with both &quot;passive&quot; star connections (with the phone wires simply bridged to each other at a central point), and &quot;active&quot; star with &quot;PhoneNet Star Controller&quot; hub hardware. In a star configuration, any wiring issue only affected one device, and problems were easy to pinpoint. PhoneNet&#x27;s low cost, flexibility, and easy troubleshooting resulted in it being the dominant choice for Mac networks into the early 1990s.

AppleTalk protocols also came to run over Ethernet (first coaxial and then twisted pair) and Token Ring physical layers, labeled by Apple as &quot;EtherTalk&quot; and &quot;TokenTalk&quot;, respectively. EtherTalk gradually became the dominant implementation method for AppleTalk as Ethernet became generally popular in the PC industry throughout the 1990s. Besides AppleTalk and TCP/IP, any Ethernet network could also simultaneously carry other protocols such as DECnet and IPX.

== Networking model ==
==Versions==

==Cross-platform solutions==
When AppleTalk was first introduced, the dominant office computing platform was the PC compatible running MS-DOS. Apple introduced the AppleTalk PC Card in early 1987, allowing PCs to join AppleTalk networks and print to LaserWriter printers. A year later AppleShare PC was released, allowing PCs to access AppleShare file servers.

The &quot;TOPS Teleconnector&quot; MS-DOS networking system over AppleTalk system enabled MS-DOS PCs to communicate over AppleTalk network hardware; it comprised an AppleTalk interface card for the PC and a suite of networking software allowing such functions as file, drive and printer sharing. As well as allowing the construction of a PC-only AppleTalk network, it allowed communication between PCs and Macs with TOPS software installed. (Macs without TOPS installed could use the same network but only to communicate with other Apple machines.) The Mac TOPS software did not match the quality of Apple&#x27;s own either in ease of use or in robustness and freedom from crashes, but the DOS software was relatively simple to use in DOS terms, and was robust.

The BSD and Linux operating systems support AppleTalk through an open source project called Netatalk, which implements the complete protocol suite and allows them to both act as native file or print servers for Macintosh computers, and print to LocalTalk printers over the network.

The Windows Server operating systems supported AppleTalk starting with Windows NT and ending after Windows Server 2003. Miramar included AppleTalk in its PC MacLAN product which was discontinued by CA in 2007. GroupLogic continues to bundle its AppleTalk protocol with its ExtremeZ-IP server software for Macintosh-Windows integration which supports Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista as well prior versions. HELIOS Software GmbH offers a proprietary implementation of the AppleTalk protocol stack, as part of their HELIOS UB2 server. This is essentially a File and Print Server suite that runs on a whole range of different platforms.

In addition, Columbia University released the Columbia AppleTalk Package (CAP) which implemented the protocol suite for various Unix flavours including Ultrix, SunOS, BSD and IRIX. This package is no longer actively maintained.

<doc id="2116" wikidata="Q201652" url="?curid=2116" title="Apple II">
<text>Apple II (&quot;apple two&quot;) is a series of microcomputers manufactured by Apple Computer, Inc. from 1977 to 1993. The first Apple II model, which gave the series its name, was designed by Steve Wozniak, and was first sold on June 10, 1977. Its success led to it being followed by the Apple II Plus, Apple IIe, Apple IIc, and Apple IIc Plus, with the 1983 IIe being the most popular. The name is trademarked with square brackets as Apple ][, then, beginning with the IIe, as Apple //.

The Apple II was a major advancement over its predecessor, the Apple I, in terms of ease of use, features, and expandability. It became one of several recognizable and successful computers during the 1980s and early 1990s, although this was mainly limited to the US. It was aggressively marketed through volume discounts and manufacturing arrangements to educational institutions, which made it the first computer in widespread use in American secondary schools, displacing the early leader Commodore PET. The effort to develop educational and business software for the Apple II, including the 1979 release of the popular VisiCalc spreadsheet, made the computer especially popular with business users and families.

The Apple II computers are based on the 6502 8-bit processor and can display text and two resolutions of color graphics. A software-controlled speaker provides one channel of low-fidelity audio. A model with more advanced graphics and sound and a 16-bit processor, the Apple II, was added in 1986. It remained compatible with earlier Apple II models, but the II has more in common with mid-1980s systems like the Atari ST, Amiga, and Acorn Archimedes.

Despite the introduction of the Motorola 68000-based Macintosh in 1984, the Apple II series still reportedly accounted for 85% of the company&#x27;s hardware sales in the first quarter of fiscal 1985. Apple continued to sell Apple II systems alongside the Macintosh until terminating the II in December 1992 and the IIe in November 1993. The last II-series Apple in production, the IIe card for Macintoshes, was discontinued on October 15, 1993; having been one of the longest running mass-produced home computer series, the total Apple II sales of all of its models during its 16-year production run were about 6 million units (including about 1.25 million Apple II models) with the peak occurring in 1983 when 1 million were sold. 

==Hardware==
Unlike preceding home microcomputers, the Apple II was sold as a finished consumer appliance rather than as a kit (unassembled or preassembled). Apple marketed the Apple II as a durable product, including a 1981 ad in which an Apple II survived a fire started when a cat belonging to one early user knocked over a lamp.

All the machines in the series, except the IIc, share similar overall design elements. The plastic case was designed to look more like a home appliance than a piece of electronic equipment, and the case can be opened without the use of tools. All models in the Apple II series have a built-in keyboard, with the exception of the II which has a separate keyboard.

Apple IIs have color and high-resolution graphics modes, sound capabilities and a built-in BASIC programming language. The motherboard holds eight expansion slots and an array of random access memory (RAM) sockets that can hold up to 48 kilobytes. Over the course of the Apple II series&#x27; life, an enormous amount of first- and third-party hardware was made available to extend the capabilities of the machine. The IIc was designed as a compact, portable unit, not intended to be disassembled, and cannot use most of the expansion hardware sold for the other machines in the series.

==Software==
The original Apple II has the operating system in ROM along with a BASIC variant called Integer BASIC. Apple eventually released Applesoft BASIC, a more advanced variant of the language which users can run instead of Integer BASIC. The Apple II series eventually supported over 1,500 software programs.

When the Disk II floppy disk drive was released in 1978, a new operating system, Apple DOS, was commissioned from Shepardson Microsystems and developed by Paul Laughton, adding support for the disk drive. The final and most popular version of this software was Apple DOS 3.3.

Apple DOS was superseded by ProDOS, which supported a hierarchical file system and larger storage devices. With an optional third-party Z80-based expansion card, the Apple II could boot into the CP/M operating system and run WordStar, dBase II, and other CP/M software. With the release of MousePaint in 1984 and the Apple II in 1986, the platform took on the look of the Macintosh user interface, including a mouse.

Much commercial Apple II software shipped on self-booting disks and does not use standard DOS disk formats. This discouraged the copying or modifying of the software on the disks, and improved loading speed.

==Models==
===Apple II===


The first Apple II computers went on sale on June 10, 1977 with a MOS Technology 6502 (later Synertek) microprocessor running at 1.023 MHz, 4 KB of RAM, an audio cassette interface for loading programs and storing data, and the Integer BASIC programming language built into the ROMs. The video controller displayed 40 columns by 24 lines of monochrome, upper-case-only (the original character set matches ASCII characters 0x20 to 0x5F) text on the screen, with NTSC composite video output suitable for display on a TV monitor, or on a regular TV set by way of a separate RF modulator. The original retail price of the computer was (with 4 KB of RAM) and (with the maximum 48 KB of RAM). To reflect the computer&#x27;s color graphics capability, the Apple logo on the casing was represented using rainbow stripes, which remained a part of Apple&#x27;s corporate logo until early 1998. The earliest Apple IIs were assembled in Silicon Valley, and later in Texas; printed circuit boards were manufactured in Ireland and Singapore.

An external -inch floppy disk drive, the Disk II, attached via a controller card that plugged into one of the computer&#x27;s expansion slots (usually slot 6), was used for data storage and retrieval to replace cassettes. The Disk II interface, created by Steve Wozniak, was regarded as an engineering masterpiece for its economy of electronic components.

Rather than having a dedicated sound-synthesis chip, the Apple II had a toggle circuit that could only emit a click through a built-in speaker; all other sounds (including two, three and, eventually, four-voice music and playback of audio samples and speech synthesis) were generated entirely by software that clicked the speaker at just the right times.

The Apple II&#x27;s multiple expansion slots permitted a wide variety of third-party devices, including Apple II peripheral cards such as serial controllers, display controllers, memory boards, hard disks, networking components, and real-time clocks. There were plug-in expansion cards – such as the Z-80 SoftCard – that permitted the Apple to use the Z80 processor and run a multitude of programs developed under the CP/M operating system, including the dBase II database and the WordStar word processor. There was also a third-party 6809 card that would allow OS-9 Level One to be run. Third-party sound cards greatly improved audio capabilities, allowing simple music synthesis and text-to-speech functions. Eventually, Apple II accelerator cards were created to double or quadruple the computer&#x27;s speed.

Rod Holt designed the Apple II&#x27;s power supply. He employed a switched-mode power supply design, which was far smaller and generated less unwanted heat than the linear power supply some other home computers used.

The original Apple II was discontinued at the start of 1981; it was superseded by the Apple II+.

===Apple II Plus===

The Apple II Plus, introduced in June 1979, included the Applesoft BASIC programming language in ROM. This Microsoft-authored dialect of BASIC, which was previously available as an upgrade, supported floating-point arithmetic, and became the standard BASIC dialect on the Apple II series (though it ran at a noticeably slower speed than Steve Wozniak&#x27;s Integer BASIC).

Except for improved graphics and disk-booting support in the ROM, and the removal of the 2k 6502 assembler to make room for the floating point BASIC, the II+ was otherwise identical to the original II in terms of electronic functionality. There were small differences in the physical appearance and keyboard. RAM prices fell during 1980–81 and all II+ machines came from the factory with a full 48 KB of memory already installed.

====Apple II Europlus and J-Plus====

After the success of the first Apple II in the United States, Apple expanded its market to include Europe, Australia and the Far East in 1979, with the Apple II Europlus (Europe, Australia) and the Apple II J-Plus (Japan). In these models, Apple made the necessary hardware, software and firmware changes in order to comply to standards outside of the US.

===Apple IIe===
The Apple II Plus was followed in 1983 by the Apple IIe, a cost-reduced yet more powerful machine that used newer chips to reduce the component count and add new features, such as the display of upper and lowercase letters and a standard 64 KB of RAM.

The IIe RAM was configured as if it were a 48 KB Apple II Plus with a language card. The machine had no slot 0, but instead had an auxiliary slot that could accept a 1 KB memory card to enable the 80-column display. This card contained only RAM; the hardware and firmware for the 80-column display was built into the Apple IIe. An &quot;extended 80-column card&quot; with more memory increased the machine&#x27;s RAM to 128 KB.

The Apple IIe was the most popular machine in the Apple II series. It has the distinction of being the longest-lived Apple computer of all time—it was manufactured and sold with only minor changes for nearly 11 years. The IIe was the last Apple II model to be sold, and was discontinued in November 1993.

During its lifespan two variations were introduced: the Apple IIe Enhanced (four replacement chips to give it some of the features of the later model Apple IIc) and the Apple IIe Platinum (a modernized case color to match other Apple products of the era, along with the addition of a numeric keypad).

Some of the feature of the IIe were carried over from the less successful &quot;Apple III&quot;, among them the ProDOS operating system.

===Apple IIc===

The Apple IIc was released in April 1984, billed as a portable Apple II because it could be easily carried due to its size and carrying handle, which could be flipped down to prop the machine up into a typing position. Unlike modern portables, it lacked a built-in display and battery. It was the first of three Apple II models to be made in the Snow White design language, and the only one that used its unique creamy off-white color.

The Apple IIc was the first Apple II to use the 65C02 low-power variant of the 6502 processor, and featured a built-in 5.25-inch floppy drive and 128 KB RAM, with a built-in disk controller that could control external drives, composite video (NTSC or PAL), serial interfaces for modem and printer, and a port usable by either a joystick or mouse. Unlike previous Apple II models, the IIc had no internal expansion slots at all.

Two different monochrome LC displays were sold for use with the IIc&#x27;s video expansion port, although both were short-lived due to high cost and poor legibility. The IIc had an external power supply that converted AC power to 15 V DC, though the IIc itself will accept between 12 V and 17 V DC, allowing third parties to offer battery packs and automobile power adapters that connected in place of the supplied AC adapter.

===Apple II===

The Apple II, released on September 15, 1986, is the penultimate and most advanced model in the Apple II series, and a radical departure from prior models. It uses a 16-bit microprocessor, the 65C816 operating at 2.8 MHz with 24-bit addressing, allowing expansion up to 8 MB of RAM. The graphics are significantly improved, with 4096 colors and new modes with resolutions of 320×200 and 640×400. The audio capabilities are vastly improved, with a built-in music synthesizer that far exceeded any other home computer. 

The Apple II evolved the platform while still maintaining near-complete backward compatibility. Its Mega II chip contains the functional equivalent of an entire Apple IIe computer (sans processor). This, combined with the 65816&#x27;s ability to execute 65C02 code directly, provides full support for legacy software, while also supporting 16-bit software running under a new OS.

The OS eventually included a Macintosh-like graphical Finder for managing disks and files and opening documents and applications, along with desk accessories. Later, the II gained the ability to read and write Macintosh disks and, through third-party software, a multitasking Unix-like shell and TrueType font support.

The GS includes a 32-voice Ensoniq 5503 DOC sample-based sound synthesizer chip with 64 KB dedicated RAM, 256 KB (or later 1.125 MB) of standard RAM, built-in peripheral ports with just a regular apple software preinstalled. (switchable between IIe-style card slots and IIc-style onboard controllers for disk drives, mouse, RGB video, and serial devices) and, built-in AppleTalk networking.

===Apple IIc Plus===

The final Apple II model was the Apple IIc Plus introduced in 1988. It was the same size and shape as the IIc that came before it, but the 5.25-inch floppy drive had been replaced with a -inch drive, the power supply was moved inside the case, and the processor was a fast 4 MHz 65C02 processor that actually ran 8-bit Apple II software faster than the II.

The IIc Plus also featured a new keyboard layout that matched the Platinum IIe and II. Unlike the IIe IIc and II, the IIc Plus came only in one version (American) and was not officially sold anywhere outside the US. The Apple IIc Plus ceased production in 1990, with its two-year production run being the shortest of all the Apple II computers.

===Apple IIe Card===
Although not an extension of the Apple II line, in 1990 the Apple IIe Card, an expansion card for the Macintosh LC, was released. Essentially a miniaturized Apple IIe computer on a card (using the Mega II chip from the Apple II), it allowed the Macintosh to run 8-bit Apple IIe software through hardware emulation, with an option to run at roughly double the speed of the original IIe (about 1.8 MHz). However, the video output was emulated in software, and, depending on how much of the screen the currently running program was trying to update in a single frame, performance could be much slower compared to a real IIe. This is due to the fact that writes from the 65C02 on the IIe Card to video memory were caught by the additional hardware on the card, so the video emulation software running on the Macintosh side could process that write and update the video display. But, while the Macintosh was processing video updates, execution of Apple II code would be temporarily halted.

With a breakout cable which connected to the back of the card, the user could attach up to two UniDisk or Apple 5.25 Drives, up to one UniDisk 3.5 drive, and a DE-9 Apple II joystick. Many of the LC&#x27;s built-in Macintosh peripherals could also be &quot;borrowed&quot; by the card when in Apple II mode, including extra RAM, the Mac&#x27;s internal 3.5-inch floppy drives, AppleTalk networking, any ProDOS-formatted hard disk partitions, the serial ports, mouse, and real-time clock. The IIe card could not, however, run software intended for the 16-bit Apple II.

==Advertising, marketing, and packaging==

Mike Markkula, a retired Intel marketing manager, provided the early critical funding for Apple Computer. From 1977 to 1981, Apple used the Regis McKenna agency for its advertisements and marketing. In 1981, Chiat-Day acquired Regis McKenna&#x27;s advertising operations and Apple used Chiat-Day. At Regis McKenna Advertising, the team assigned to launch the Apple II consisted of Rob Janoff, art director, Chip Schafer, copywriter and Bill Kelley, account executive. Janoff came up with the Apple logo with a bite out of it. The design was originally an olive green with matching company logotype all in lowercase. Steve Jobs insisted on promoting the color capability of the Apple II by putting rainbow stripes on the Apple logo. In its letterhead and business card implementation, the rounded &quot;a&quot; of the logotype echoed the &quot;bite&quot; in the logo. This logo was developed simultaneously with an advertisement and a brochure; the latter being produced for distribution initially at the first West Coast Computer Faire.

Since the original Apple II, Apple has paid high attention to its quality of packaging, partly because of Steve Jobs&#x27; personal preferences and opinions on packaging and final product appearance. All of Apple&#x27;s packaging for the Apple II series looked similar, featuring much clean white space and showing the Apple rainbow logo prominently. For several years up until the late 1980s, Apple used the Motter Tektura font for packaging, until changing to the Apple Garamond font.

Apple ran the first advertisement for the Apple II, a two-page spread ad titled &quot;Introducing Apple II&quot;, in &quot;BYTE&quot; in July 1977. The first brochure, was entitled &quot;Simplicity&quot; and the copy in both the ad and brochure pioneered &quot;demystifying&quot; language intended to make the new idea of a home computer more &quot;personal.&quot; The Apple II introduction ad was later run in the September 1977 issue of &quot;Scientific American&quot;.

Apple later aired eight television commercials for the Apple II, emphasizing its benefits to education and students, along with some print ads.

==Clones==

The Apple II was frequently cloned, both in the United States and abroad, in a similar way to the IBM PC. According to some sources (see below), more than 190 different models of Apple II clones were manufactured. Most could not be legally imported into the United States. Apple sued and sought criminal charges against clone makers in more than a dozen countries.

==Data storage==
===Cassette===
Originally the Apple II used Compact Cassette tapes for program and data storage. A dedicated tape recorder along the lines of the Commodore Datasette was never produced; Apple recommended using the Panasonic RQ309 in some of its early printed documentation. The uses of common consumer cassette recorders and a standard video monitor or television set (with a third-party RF modulator) made the total cost of owning an Apple II less expensive and helped contribute to the Apple II&#x27;s success.

Cassette storage may have been inexpensive, but it was also slow and unreliable. The Apple II&#x27;s lack of a disk drive was &quot;a glaring weakness&quot; in what was otherwise intended to be a polished, professional product. Recognizing that the II needed a disk drive to be taken seriously, Apple set out to develop a disk drive and a DOS to run it. Wozniak spent the 1977 Christmas holidays designing a disk controller that reduced the number of chips used by a factor of 10 compared to existing controllers. Still lacking a DOS, and with Wozniak inexperienced in operating system design, Jobs approached Shepardson Microsystems with the project. On April 10, 1978, Apple signed a contract for $13,000 with Shepardson to develop the DOS.

Even after disk drives made the cassette tape interfaces obsolete they were still used by enthusiasts as simple one-bit audio input-output ports. Ham radio operators used the cassette input to receive slow scan TV (single frame images). A commercial speech recognition Blackjack program was available, after some user-specific voice training it would recognize simple commands (Hit, stand). Bob Bishop&#x27;s &quot;Music Kaleidoscope&quot; was a simple program that monitored the cassette input port and based on zero-crossings created color patterns on the screen, a predecessor to current audio visualization plug-ins for media players. Music Kaleidoscope was especially popular on projection TV sets in dance halls.

===The OS Disk===
Apple and many third-party developers made software available on tape at first, but after the Disk II became available in 1978, tape-based Apple II software essentially disappeared from the market. The initial price of the Disk II drive and controller was US$595, although a $100 off coupon was available through the Apple newsletter &quot;Contact&quot;. The controller could handle two drives and a second drive (without controller) retailed for $495.

The Disk II single-sided floppy drive used 5.25-inch floppy disks; double-sided disks could be used, one side at a time, by turning them over and notching a hole for the write protect sensor. The first disk operating systems for the were and DOS 3.2, which stored 113.75 KB on each disk, organized into 35 tracks of 13 256-byte sectors each. After about two years, DOS 3.3 was introduced, storing 140 KB thanks to a minor firmware change on the disk controller that allowed it to store 16 sectors per track. (This upgrade was user-installable as two PROMs on older controllers.) After the release of DOS 3.3, the user community discontinued use of except for running legacy software. Programs that required DOS 3.2 were fairly rare; however, as DOS 3.3 was not a major architectural change aside from the number of sectors per track, a program called MUFFIN was provided with DOS 3.3 to allow users to copy files from DOS 3.2 disks to DOS 3.3 disks. It was possible for software developers to create a DOS 3.2 disk which would also boot on a system with firmware.

Later, double-sided drives, with heads to read both sides of the disk, became available from third-party companies. (Apple only produced double-sided 5.25-inch disks for the Lisa 1 computer).

On a DOS 3.x disk, tracks 0, 1, and most of track 2 were reserved to store the operating system. (It was possible, with a special utility, to reclaim most of this space for data if a disk did not need to be bootable.) A short ROM program on the disk controller had the ability to seek to track zero which it did without regard for the read/write head&#x27;s current position, resulting in the characteristic &quot;chattering&quot; sound of a Disk II boot, which was the read/write head hitting the rubber stop block at the end of the rail – and read and execute code from sector 0. The code contained in there would then pull in the rest of the operating system. DOS stored the disk&#x27;s directory on track 17, smack in the middle of the 35-track disks, in order to reduce the average seek time to the frequently used directory track. The directory was fixed in size and could hold a maximum of 105 files. Subdirectories were not supported.

Most game publishers did not include DOS on their floppy disks, since they needed the memory it occupied more than its capabilities; instead, they often wrote their own boot loaders and read-only file systems. This also served to discourage &quot;crackers&quot; from snooping around in the game&#x27;s copy-protection code, since the data on the disk was not in files that could be accessed easily.

Some third-party manufacturers produced floppy drives that could write 40 tracks to most 5.25-inch disks, yielding 160 KB of storage per disk, but the format did not catch on widely, and no known commercial software was published on 40-track media. Most drives, even Disk IIs, could write 36 tracks; a two byte modification to DOS to format the extra track was common.

The Apple Disk II stored 140 KB on single-sided, &quot;single-density&quot; floppy disks, but it was very common for Apple II users to extend the capacity of a single-sided floppy disk to 280 KB by cutting out a second write-protect notch on the side of the disk using a &quot;disk notcher&quot; or hole puncher and inserting the disk flipped over. Double-sided disks, with notches on both sides, were available at a higher price, but in practice the magnetic coating on the reverse of nominally single-sided disks was usually of good enough quality to be used (both sides were coated in the same way to prevent warping, although only one side was certified for use). Early on, diskette manufacturers routinely warned that this technique would damage the read/write head of the drives or wear out the disk faster, and these warnings were frequently repeated in magazines of the day. In practice, however, this method was an inexpensive way to store twice as much data for no extra cost, and was widely used for commercially released floppies as well.

Later, Apple IIs were able to use 3.5-inch disks with a total capacity of 800 KB and hard disks. did not support these drives natively; third-party software was required, and disks larger than about 400 KB had to be split up into multiple &quot;virtual disk volumes.&quot;

DOS 3.3 was succeeded by ProDOS, a 1983 descendant of the Apple ///&#x27;s SOS. It added support for subdirectories and volumes up to 32 MB in size. ProDOS became the DOS of choice; AppleWorks and other newer programs required it.

==Legacy==
The Apple II series of computers had an enormous impact on the technology industry and expanded the role of microcomputers in society. The Apple II was the first personal computer many people ever saw. Its price was within the reach of many middle-class families, and a partnership with MECC helped make the Apple II popular in schools. By the end of 1980 Apple had already sold over 100,000 Apple IIs, and at the introduction of the II, models in the range had been sold. However, in other markets, the range saw rather more limited adoption, with only 120,000 units selling in the UK over this nine-year period.

The Apple II&#x27;s popularity bootstrapped the computer game and educational software markets and began the boom in the word processor and computer printer markets. The first spreadsheet application, VisiCalc, was initially released for the Apple II, and many businesses bought them just to run VisiCalc. Its success drove IBM in part to create the IBM PC, which many businesses purchased to run spreadsheet and word processing software, at first ported from Apple II versions.

The Apple II&#x27;s slots, allowing any peripheral card to take control of the bus and directly access memory, enabled an independent industry of card manufacturers who together created a flood of hardware products that let users build systems that were far more powerful and useful (at a lower cost) than any competing system, most of which were not nearly as expandable and were universally proprietary. The first peripheral card was a blank prototyping card intended for electronics enthusiasts who wanted to design their own peripherals for the Apple II.

Specialty peripherals kept the Apple II in use in industry and education environments for many years after Apple Computer stopped supporting the Apple II. Well into the 1990s every clean-room (the super-clean facility where spacecraft are prepared for flight) at the Kennedy Space Center used an Apple II to monitor the environment and air quality. Most planetariums used Apple IIs to control their projectors and other equipment.

Even the game port was unusually powerful and could be used for digital and analog input and output. The early manuals included instructions for how to build a circuit with only four commonly available components (one transistor and three resistors) and a software routine to drive a common Teletype Model 33 machine. Don Lancaster used the game port I/O to drive a LaserWriter printer.

===Modern use===
Today, emulators for various Apple II models are available to run Apple II software on macOS, Linux, Microsoft Windows, homebrew enabled Nintendo DS and other operating systems. Numerous disk images of Apple II software are available free over the Internet for use with these emulators. AppleWin and MESS are among the best emulators compatible with most Apple II images. The MESS emulator supports recording and playing back of Apple II emulation sessions, as does Home Action Replay Page (a.k.a. HARP).

There is still a small annual convention, KansasFest, dedicated to the platform.

In 2017, the band 8 Bit Weapon released the world&#x27;s first 100% Apple II-based music album entitled, &quot;Class Apples&quot;. The album featured dance-oriented cover versions of classical music by Bach, Beethoven, and Mozart recorded directly off the Apple II motherboard.

<text>The Apple III (styled as apple ///) is a business-oriented personal computer produced by Apple Computer and released in 1980. Running the Apple SOS operating system, it was intended as the successor to the Apple II; however, it was largely considered a failure in the market. It was designed to provide features business users wanted: a true typewriter-style keyboard with upper and lowercase letters (the Apple II only supported uppercase at the time) and an 80-column display.

It had the internal code name of &quot;Sara&quot;, named after Wendell Sander&#x27;s daughter. The system was announced on May 19, 1980, and released in late November that year. Serious stability issues required a design overhaul and a recall of the first 14,000 machines produced. The Apple III was formally reintroduced on November 9, 1981.

Damage to the computer&#x27;s reputation had already been done, however, and it failed to do well commercially. Development stopped, and the Apple III was discontinued on April 24, 1984. Its last successor, the III Plus, was dropped from the Apple product line in September 1985.

An estimated 65,000 to 75,000 Apple III computers were sold. The Apple III Plus brought this up to approximately 120,000. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak stated that the primary reason for the Apple III&#x27;s failure was that the system was designed by Apple&#x27;s marketing department, unlike Apple&#x27;s previous engineering-driven projects. The Apple III&#x27;s failure led Apple to reevaluate its plan to phase out the Apple II, prompting the eventual continuation of development of the older machine. As a result, later Apple II models incorporated some hardware and software technologies of the Apple III.

==Overview==
===Design===
Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs expected hobbyists to purchase the Apple II; however, because of VisiCalc and Disk II, small businesses purchased 90% of the computers. The Apple III was designed to be a business computer and successor. Though the Apple II contributed to the inspirations of several important business products, such as VisiCalc, Multiplan, and Apple Writer, the computer&#x27;s hardware architecture, operating system, and developer environment are limited. Apple management intended to clearly establish market segmentation by designing the Apple III to appeal to the 90% business market, leaving the Apple II to home and education users. Management believed that &quot;once the Apple III was out, the Apple II would stop selling in six months&quot;, Wozniak said.

The Apple III is powered by a 1.8 megahertz Synertek 6502A or 6502B 8-bit CPU and, like some of the later machines in the Apple II family, uses bank switching techniques to address memory beyond the 6502&#x27;s traditional 64 KB limit, up to 256 KB in the III&#x27;s case. Third-party vendors produced memory upgrade kits that allow the Apple III to reach up to 512 KB of random-access memory (RAM). Other Apple III built-in features include an 80-column, 24-line display with upper and lowercase characters, a numeric keypad, dual-speed (pressure-sensitive) cursor control keys, 6-bit (DAC) audio, and a built-in 140-kilobyte 5.25-inch floppy disk drive. Graphics modes include 560x192 in black and white, and 280x192 with 16 colors or shades of gray. Unlike the Apple II, the Disk III controller is part of the logic board.

The Apple III is the first Apple product to allow the user to choose both a screen font and a keyboard layout: either QWERTY or Dvorak. These choices cannot be changed while programs were running. This was unlike the Apple IIc, which has a keyboard switch directly above the keyboard, allowing the user to switch on the fly.

===Software===
The Apple III introduced an advanced operating system called Apple SOS, pronounced &quot;apple sauce&quot;. Its ability to address resources by name allows the Apple III to be more scalable than the Apple II&#x27;s addressing by physical location such as codice_1. Apple SOS allows the full capacity of a storage device to be used as a single volume, such as the Apple ProFile hard disk drive, and it supports a hierarchical file system. Some of the features and code base of Apple SOS were later adopted into the Apple II&#x27;s ProDOS and GS/OS operating systems, as well as Lisa 7/7 and Mac OS.

With a starting price of $4,340 (equivalent to $17,356 as of 2024) and a maximum price of $7,800 (equivalent to $31,194 as of 2024), the Apple III was more expensive than many of the CP/M-based business computers that were available at the time. Few software applications other than VisiCalc are available for the computer; according to a presentation at KansasFest 2012, fewer than 50 Apple III-specific software packages were ever published, most shipping when the III Plus was released. Because Apple did not view the Apple III as suitable for hobbyists, it did not provide much of the technical software information that accompanies the Apple II. Originally intended as a direct replacement to the Apple II, it was designed to be backward compatible with Apple II software. However, since Apple did not want to encourage continued development of the II platform, Apple II compatibility exists only in a special Apple II Mode which is limited in its capabilities to the emulation of a basic Apple II Plus configuration with of RAM. Special chips were intentionally added to prevent access from Apple II Mode to the III&#x27;s advanced features such as its larger amount of memory.

===Peripherals===
The Apple III has four expansion slots, a number that &quot;inCider&quot; in 1986 called &quot;miserly&quot;., also saying Apple II cards are compatible but risk violating government RFI regulations, and require Apple III-specific device drivers; &quot;BYTE&quot; stated that &quot;Apple provides virtually no information on how to write them&quot;. As with software, Apple provided little hardware technical information with the computer but Apple III-specific products became available, such as one that made the computer compatible with the Apple IIe. Several new Apple-produced peripherals were developed for the Apple III. The original Apple III has a built-in real-time clock, which is recognized by Apple SOS. The clock was later removed from the &quot;revised&quot; model, and was instead made available as an add-on.

Along with the built-in floppy drive, the Apple III can also handle up to three additional external Disk III floppy disk drives. The Disk III is only officially compatible with the Apple III. The Apple III Plus requires an adaptor from Apple to use the Disk III with its DB-25 disk port.

With the introduction of the revised Apple III a year after launch, Apple began offering the ProFile external hard disk system. Priced at $3,499 for 5 MB of storage, it also required a peripheral slot for its controller card.

===Backward compatibility===
The Apple III has the built-in hardware capability to run Apple II software. In order to do so, an emulation boot disk is required that functionally turns the machine into a standard 48-kilobyte Apple II Plus, until it is powered off. The keyboard, internal floppy drive (and one external Disk III), display (color is provided through the &#x27;B/W video&#x27; port) and speaker all act as Apple II peripherals. The paddle and serial ports can also function in Apple II mode, however with some limitations and compatibility issues.

Apple engineers added specialized circuitry with the sole purpose of blocking access to its advanced features when running in Apple II emulation mode. This was done primarily to discourage further development and interest in the Apple II line, and to push the Apple III as its successor. For example, no more than of RAM can be accessed, even if the machine has of RAM or higher present. Many Apple II programs require a minimum of of RAM, making them impossible to run on the Apple III. Similarly, access to lowercase support, 80 columns text, or its more advanced graphics and sound are blocked by this hardware circuitry, making it impossible for even skilled software programmers to bypass Apple&#x27;s lockout. A third-party company, Titan Technologies, sold an expansion board called the III Plus II that allows Apple II mode to access more memory, a standard game port, and with a later released companion card, even emulate the Apple IIe.

Certain Apple II slot cards can be installed in the Apple III and used in native III-mode with custom written SOS device drivers, including Grappler Plus and Liron 3.5 Controller.

===Revisions===
After overheating issues were attributed to serious design flaws, a redesigned logic board was introduced in mid-December 1981 – which included a lower power supply requirement, wider circuit traces and better-designed chip sockets. The $3,495 revised model also includes 256 KB of RAM as the standard configuration. The 14,000 units of the original Apple III sold were returned and replaced with the entirely new revised model.

====Apple III Plus====
Apple discontinued the III in October 1983 because it violated FCC regulations, and the FCC required the company to change the redesigned computer&#x27;s name. It introduced the Apple III Plus in December 1983 at a price of US$2,995. This newer version includes a built-in clock, video interlacing, standardized rear port connectors, 55-watt power supply, 256 KB of RAM as standard, and a redesigned, Apple IIe-like keyboard.

Owners of the Apple III could purchase individual III Plus upgrades, like the clock and interlacing feature, and obtain the newer logic board as a service replacement. A keyboard upgrade kit, dubbed &quot;Apple III Plus upgrade kit&quot; was also made available – which included the keyboard, cover, keyboard encoder ROM, and logo replacements. This upgrade had to be installed by an authorized service technician.

==Design flaws==

According to Wozniak, the Apple III &quot;had 100 percent hardware failures&quot;. Former Apple executive Taylor Pohlman stated that:

Jobs insisted on the idea of having no fan or air vents, in order to make the computer run quietly. He would later push this same ideology onto almost all Apple models he had control of, from the Apple Lisa and Macintosh 128K to the iMac. To allow the computer to dissipate heat, the base of the Apple III was made of heavy cast aluminum, which supposedly acts as a heat sink. One advantage to the aluminum case was a reduction in RFI (Radio Frequency Interference), a problem which had plagued the Apple II series throughout its history. Unlike the Apple II, the power supply was mounted – without its own shell – in a compartment separate from the logic board. The decision to use an aluminum shell ultimately led to engineering issues which resulted in the Apple III&#x27;s reliability problems. The lead time for manufacturing the shells was high, and this had to be done before the motherboard was finalized. Later, it was realized that there was not enough room on the motherboard for all of the components unless narrow traces were used.

Many Apple IIIs were thought to have failed due to their inability to properly dissipate heat. &quot;inCider&quot; stated in 1986 that &quot;Heat has always been a formidable enemy of the Apple ///&quot;, and some users reported that their Apple IIIs became so hot that the chips started dislodging from the board, causing the screen to display garbled data or their disk to come out of the slot &quot;melted&quot;. &quot;BYTE&quot; wrote, &quot;the integrated circuits tended to wander out of their sockets&quot;. It has been rumored Apple advised customers to tilt the front of the Apple III six inches above the desk and then drop it to reseat the chips as a temporary solution. Other analyses blame a faulty automatic chip insertion process, not heat.

Case designer Jerry Manock denied the design flaw charges, insisting that tests proved that the unit adequately dissipated the internal heat. The primary cause, he claimed, was a major logic board design problem. The logic board used &quot;fineline&quot; technology that was not fully mature at the time, with narrow, closely spaced traces. When chips were &quot;stuffed&quot; into the board and wave-soldered, solder bridges would form between traces that were not supposed to be connected. This caused numerous short circuits, which required hours of costly diagnosis and hand rework to fix. Apple designed a new circuit board with more layers and normal-width traces. The new logic board was laid out by one designer on a huge drafting board, rather than using the costly CAD-CAM system used for the previous board, and the new design worked.

Earlier Apple III units came with a built-in real time clock. The hardware, however, would fail after prolonged use. Assuming that National Semiconductor would test all parts before shipping them, Apple did not perform this level of testing. Apple was soldering chips directly to boards and could not easily replace a bad chip if one was found. Eventually, Apple solved this problem by removing the real-time clock from the Apple III&#x27;s specification rather than shipping the Apple III with the clock pre-installed, and then sold the peripheral as a level 1 technician add-on.

Microsoft and Apple each developed their own versions of BASIC for the Apple III. Apple III Microsoft BASIC was designed to run on the CP/M platform available for the Apple III. Apple Business BASIC shipped with the Apple III. Donn Denman ported Applesoft BASIC to SOS and reworked it to take advantage of the extended memory of the Apple III.

Both languages introduced a number of new or improved features over Applesoft BASIC. Both languages replaced Applesoft&#x27;s single-precision floating-point variables using 5-byte storage with the somewhat-reduced-precision 4-byte variables, while also adding a larger numerical format. Apple III Microsoft BASIC provides double-precision floating-point variables, taking 8 bytes of storage, while Apple Business BASIC offers an extra-long integer type, also taking 8 bytes for storage. Both languages also retain 2-byte integers, and maximum 255-character strings.

Other new features common to both languages include:
*Incorporation of disk-file commands within the language.
*Operators for MOD and for integer-division.
*An optional ELSE clause in IF...THEN statements.
*HEX$() function for hexadecimal-format output.
*INSTR function for finding a substring within a string.
*PRINT USING statement to control format of output. Apple Business BASIC had an option, in addition to directly specifying the format with a string expression, of giving the line number where an IMAGE statement gave the formatting expression, similar to a FORMAT statement in FORTRAN.

Some features work differently in each language:
===Microsoft BASIC additional features===
* function to replace Applesoft&#x27;s command.
* statement to input an entire line of text, regardless of punctuation, into a single string variable.
* and statements to automatically direct output to paper.
* and statements to left- or right-justify a string expression within a given string variable&#x27;s character length.
* function for output, and &quot;&amp;&quot;- or &quot;&amp;O&quot;-formatted expressions, for manipulating octal notation.
* function for generating blank spaces outside of a statement, and function to do likewise with any character.
*... statements, for loop structures built on general Boolean conditions without an index variable.
*Bitwise Boolean (16-bit) operations (, , ), with additional operators , , .
*Line number specification in the command.
* options of (to skip to the statement after that which caused the error) or a specified line number (which replaces the idea of exiting error-handling by -line, thus avoiding Applesoft II&#x27;s stack error problem).
*Multiple parameters in user-defined () functions.
*A return to the old Applesoft One concept of having multiple functions at different addresses, by establishing ten different functions, numbered to , with separate statements to define the address of each. The argument passed to a function can be of any specific type, including string. The returned value can also be of any type, by default the same type as the argument passed.

There is no support for graphics provided within the language, nor for reading analog controls or buttons; nor is there a means of defining the active window of the text screen.

===Business BASIC additional features===
Apple Business BASIC eliminates all references to absolute memory addresses. Thus, the POKE command and PEEK() function were not included in the language, and new features replaced the CALL statement and USR() function. The functionality of certain features in Applesoft that had been achieved with various PEEK and POKE locations is now provided by:
* BUTTON() function to read game-controller buttons
* WINDOW statement to define the active window of the text screen by its coordinates
* KBD, HPOS, and VPOS system variables

External binary subroutines and functions are loaded into memory by a single INVOKE disk-command that loads separately-assembled code modules. A PERFORM statement is then used to call an INVOKEd procedure by name, with an argument-list. INVOKEd functions would be referenced in expressions by EXFN. (floating-point) or EXFN%. (integer), with the function name appended, plus the argument-list for the function.

Graphics are supported with an INVOKEd module, with features including displaying text within graphics in various fonts, within four different graphics modes available on the Apple III.

==Reception==

Despite devoting the majority of its R&amp;D to the Apple III and so ignoring the II that for a while dealers had difficulty in obtaining the latter, the III&#x27;s technical problems made marketing the computer difficult. Ed Smith, who after designing the APF Imagination Machine worked as a distributor&#x27;s representative, described the III as &quot;a complete disaster&quot;. He recalled that he &quot;was responsible for going to every dealership, setting up the Apple III in their showroom, and then explaining to them the functions of the Apple III, which in many cases didn&#x27;t really work&quot;.

===Sales===
&quot;BYTE&quot; reported in 1982 that Apple had sold only 10,000 of the original Apple III, compared to 350,000 Apple IIs sold by the end of 1981. Pohlman reported that Apple was only selling 500 units a month by late 1981, mostly as replacements. The company was able to eventually raise monthly sales to 5,000, but the IBM PC&#x27;s successful launch had encouraged software companies to develop for it instead, prompting Apple to shift focus to the Lisa and Macintosh. The PC almost ended sales of the Apple III, the most closely comparable Apple computer model. By early 1984, sales were primarily to existing III owners, Apple itself—its 4,500 employees were equipped with some 3,000-4,500 units—and some small businesses. Apple finally discontinued the Apple III series on April 24, 1984, four months after introducing the III Plus, after selling only up to 75,000 units and replacing 14,000 defective units.

Jobs said the company lost &quot;incalculable amounts&quot; of money on the Apple III. Wozniak estimated that Apple had spent $100 million on the III instead of improving the II and better competing against IBM. Pohlman claimed that there was a &quot;stigma&quot; at Apple associated with having contributed to the computer. Most employees who worked on the III reportedly left Apple.

==Legacy==
The file system and some design ideas from Apple SOS, the Apple III&#x27;s operating system, were part of Apple ProDOS and Apple GS/OS, the major operating systems for the Apple II following the demise of the Apple III, as well as the Apple Lisa, which was the de facto business-oriented successor to the Apple III. The hierarchical file system influenced the evolution of the Macintosh: while the original Macintosh File System (MFS) was a flat file system designed for a floppy disk without subdirectories, subsequent file systems were hierarchical. By comparison, the IBM PC&#x27;s first file system (again designed for floppy disks) was also flat and later versions (designed for hard disks) were hierarchical.

===In popular culture===
At the start of the Walt Disney Pictures film &quot;Tron&quot;, lead character Kevin Flynn (played by Jeff Bridges) is seen hacking into the ENCOM mainframe using an Apple III.

<doc id="2118" wikidata="Q300159" url="?curid=2118" title="AVL tree">
<text>In computer science, an AVL tree (named after inventors Adelson-Velsky and Landis) is a self-balancing binary search tree. In an AVL tree, the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one; if at any time they differ by more than one, rebalancing is done to restore this property. Lookup, insertion, and deletion all take time in both the average and worst cases, where formula_1 is the number of nodes in the tree prior to the operation. Insertions and deletions may require the tree to be rebalanced by one or more tree rotations.

The AVL tree is named after its two Soviet inventors, Georgy Adelson-Velsky and Evgenii Landis, who published it in their 1962 paper &quot;An algorithm for the organization of information&quot;. It is the first self-balancing binary search tree data structure to be invented.

AVL trees are often compared with red–black trees because both support the same set of operations and take formula_2 time for the basic operations. For lookup-intensive applications, AVL trees are faster than red–black trees because they are more strictly balanced. Similar to red–black trees, AVL trees are height-balanced. Both are, in general, neither weight-balanced nor formula_3-balanced for any formula_4;

AVL trees are more rigidly balanced than RB trees with an asymptotic relation AVL/RB ≈0.720 of the maximal heights. For insertions and deletions, Ben Pfaff shows in 79 measurements a relation of AVL/RB between 0.677 and 1.077 with median ≈0.947 and geometric mean ≈0.910.

<doc id="2120" wikidata="Q192596" url="?curid=2120" title="Aliphatic compound">
<text>In organic chemistry, hydrocarbons (compounds composed solely of carbon and hydrogen) are divided into two classes: aromatic compounds and aliphatic compounds (; G. &quot;aleiphar&quot;, fat, oil). Aliphatic compounds can be saturated (in which all the C-C bonds are single requiring the structure to be completed, or &#x27;saturated&#x27;, by hydrogen) like hexane, or , like hexene and hexyne. Open-chain compounds, whether straight or branched, and which contain no rings of any type, are always aliphatic. Cyclic compounds can be aliphatic if they are not aromatic.

== Structure ==

Aliphatic compounds can be saturated, joined by single bonds (alkanes), or unsaturated, with double bonds (alkenes) or triple bonds (alkynes). If other elements (heteroatoms) are bound to the carbon chain, the most common being oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and chlorine, it is no longer a hydrocarbon, and therefore no longer an aliphatic compound. However, such compounds may still be referred to as aliphatic if the hydrocarbon portion of the molecule is aliphatic, e.g. aliphatic amines, to differentiate them from aromatic amines.

The least complex aliphatic compound is methane (CH4).

== Properties ==

Most aliphatic compounds are flammable, allowing the use of hydrocarbons as fuel, such as methane in natural gas for stoves or heating; butane in torches and lighters; various aliphatic (as well as aromatic) hydrocarbons in liquid transportation fuels like petrol/gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel; and other uses such as ethyne (acetylene) in welding.

== Examples of aliphatic compounds ==
The most important aliphatic compounds are:

* n-, iso- and cyclo-alkanes (saturated hydrocarbons)
* n-, iso- and cyclo-alkenes and -alkynes (unsaturated hydrocarbons).

Important examples of low-molecular aliphatic compounds can be found in the list below (sorted by the number of carbon-atoms):

<doc id="2122" wikidata="Q34362" url="?curid=2122" title="Astrology">
<text>Astrology is a range of divinatory practices, recognized as pseudoscientific since the 18th century, that propose that information about human affairs and terrestrial events may be discerned by studying the apparent positions of celestial objects. Different cultures have employed forms of astrology since at least the 2nd millennium BCE, these practices having originated in calendrical systems used to predict seasonal shifts and to interpret celestial cycles as signs of divine communications.

Most, if not all, cultures have attached importance to what they observed in the sky, and some—such as the Hindus, Chinese, and the Maya—developed elaborate systems for predicting terrestrial events from celestial observations. Western astrology, one of the oldest astrological systems still in use, can trace its roots to 19th–17th century BCE Mesopotamia, from where it spread to Ancient Greece, Rome, the Islamic world, and eventually Central and Western Europe. Contemporary Western astrology is often associated with systems of horoscopes that purport to explain aspects of a person&#x27;s personality and predict significant events in their lives based on the positions of celestial objects; the majority of professional astrologers rely on such systems.

Throughout its history, astrology has had its detractors, competitors and skeptics who opposed it for moral, religious, political, and empirical reasons. Nonetheless, prior to the Enlightenment, astrology was generally considered a scholarly tradition and was common in learned circles, often in close relation with astronomy, meteorology, medicine, and alchemy. It was present in political circles and is mentioned in various works of literature, from Dante Alighieri and Geoffrey Chaucer to William Shakespeare, Lope de Vega, and Pedro Calderón de la Barca. During the Enlightenment, however, astrology lost its status as an area of legitimate scholarly pursuit.

Following the end of the 19th century and the wide-scale adoption of the scientific method, researchers have successfully challenged astrology on both theoretical and experimental grounds, and have shown it to have no scientific validity or explanatory power. Astrology thus lost its academic and theoretical standing in the western world, and common belief in it largely declined, until a continuing resurgence starting in the 1960s.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;&quot; comes from the early Latin word &quot;&quot;, which derives from the Greek —from &quot;astron&quot; (&quot;star&quot;) and &quot;-logia&quot;, (&quot;study of&quot;—&quot;account of the stars&quot;). The word entered the English language via Latin and medieval French, and its use overlapped considerably with that of &quot;astronomy&quot; (derived from the Latin &quot;&quot;). By the 17th century, &quot;astronomy&quot; became established as the scientific term, with &quot;astrology&quot; referring to divinations and schemes for predicting human affairs.

== History ==


Many cultures have attached importance to astronomical events, and the Indians, Chinese, and Maya developed elaborate systems for predicting terrestrial events from celestial observations. A form of astrology was practised in the Old Babylonian period of Mesopotamia, . &quot;Vedāṅga Jyotiṣa&quot; is one of earliest known Hindu texts on astronomy and astrology (&quot;Jyotisha&quot;). The text is dated between 1400 BCE to final centuries BCE by various scholars according to astronomical and linguistic evidences. Chinese astrology was elaborated in the Zhou dynasty (1046–256 BCE). Hellenistic astrology after 332 BCE mixed Babylonian astrology with Egyptian Decanic astrology in Alexandria, creating horoscopic astrology. Alexander the Great&#x27;s conquest of Asia allowed astrology to spread to Ancient Greece and Rome. In Rome, astrology was associated with &quot;Chaldean wisdom&quot;. After the conquest of Alexandria in the 7th century, astrology was taken up by Islamic scholars, and Hellenistic texts were translated into Arabic and Persian. In the 12th century, Arabic texts were imported to Europe and translated into Latin. Major astronomers including Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler and Galileo practised as court astrologers. Astrological references appear in literature in the works of poets such as Dante Alighieri and Geoffrey Chaucer, and of playwrights such as Christopher Marlowe and William Shakespeare.

Throughout most of its history, astrology was considered a scholarly tradition. It was accepted in political and academic contexts, and was connected with other studies, such as astronomy, alchemy, meteorology, and medicine. At the end of the 17th century, new scientific concepts in astronomy and physics (such as heliocentrism and Newtonian mechanics) called astrology into question. Astrology thus lost its academic and theoretical standing, and common belief in astrology has largely declined.

=== Ancient world ===
Astrology, in its broadest sense, is the search for meaning in the sky. Early evidence for humans making conscious attempts to measure, record, and predict seasonal changes by reference to astronomical cycles, appears as markings on bones and cave walls, which show that lunar cycles were being noted as early as 25,000 years ago. This was a first step towards recording the Moon&#x27;s influence upon tides and rivers, and towards organising a communal calendar. Farmers addressed agricultural needs with increasing knowledge of the constellations that appear in the different seasons—and used the rising of particular star-groups to herald annual floods or seasonal activities. By the 3rd millennium BCE, civilisations had sophisticated awareness of celestial cycles, and may have oriented temples in alignment with heliacal risings of the stars.

Scattered evidence suggests that the oldest known astrological references are copies of texts made in the ancient world. The Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa is thought to have been compiled in Babylon around 1700 BCE. A scroll documenting an early use of electional astrology is doubtfully ascribed to the reign of the Sumerian ruler Gudea of Lagash ( – 2124 BCE). This describes how the gods revealed to him in a dream the constellations that would be most favourable for the planned construction of a temple. However, there is controversy about whether these were genuinely recorded at the time or merely ascribed to ancient rulers by posterity. The oldest undisputed evidence of the use of astrology as an integrated system of knowledge is therefore attributed to the records of the first dynasty of Babylon (1950–1651 BCE). This astrology had some parallels with Hellenistic Greek (western) astrology, including the zodiac, a norming point near 9 degrees in Aries, the trine aspect, planetary exaltations, and the dodekatemoria (the twelve divisions of 30 degrees each). The Babylonians viewed celestial events as possible signs rather than as causes of physical events.

The system of Chinese astrology was elaborated during the Zhou dynasty (1046–256 BCE) and flourished during the Han dynasty (2nd century BCE to 2nd century CE), during which all the familiar elements of traditional Chinese culture – the Yin-Yang philosophy, theory of the five elements, Heaven and Earth, Confucian morality – were brought together to formalise the philosophical principles of Chinese medicine and divination, astrology, and alchemy.

The ancient Arabs that inhabited the Arabian Peninsula before the advent of Islam used to profess a widespread belief in fatalism (&quot;ḳadar&quot;) alongside a fearful consideration for the sky and the stars, which they held to be ultimately responsible for every phenomena that occurs on Earth and for the destiny of humankind. Accordingly, they shaped their entire lives in accordance with their interpretations of astral configurations and phenomena.

==== Ancient objections ====
The Hellenistic schools of philosophical skepticism criticized the rationality of astrology. Criticism of astrology by academic skeptics such as Cicero, Carneades, and Favorinus; and Pyrrhonists such as Sextus Empiricus has been preserved.

Carneades argued that belief in fate denies free will and morality; that people born at different times can all die in the same accident or battle; and that contrary to uniform influences from the stars, tribes and cultures are all different.

Cicero, in &quot;De Divinatione&quot;, leveled a critique of astrology that some modern philosophers consider to be the first working definition of pseudoscience and the answer to the demarcation problem. Philosopher of Science Massimo Pigliucci, building on the work of Historian of Science, Damien Fernandez-Beanato, argues that Cicero outlined a &quot;convincing distinction between astrology and astronomy that remains valid in the twenty-first century.&quot; Cicero stated the twins objection (that with close birth times, personal outcomes can be very different), later developed by Augustine. He argued that since the other planets are much more distant from the Earth than the Moon, they could have only very tiny influence compared to the Moon&#x27;s. He also argued that if astrology explains everything about a person&#x27;s fate, then it wrongly ignores the visible effect of inherited ability and parenting, changes in health worked by medicine, or the effects of the weather on people.

Favorinus argued that it was absurd to imagine that stars and planets would affect human bodies in the same way as they affect the tides, and equally absurd that small motions in the heavens cause large changes in people&#x27;s fates.

Sextus Empiricus argued that it was absurd to link human attributes with myths about the signs of the zodiac, and wrote an entire book, &quot;Against the Astrologers&quot; (Πρὸς ἀστρολόγους, &quot;Pros astrologous&quot;), compiling arguments against astrology. &quot;Against the Astrologers&quot; was the fifth section of a larger work arguing against philosophical and scientific inquiry in general, &quot;Against the Professors&quot; (Πρὸς μαθηματικούς, &quot;Pros mathematikous&quot;).

Plotinus, a neoplatonist, argued that since the fixed stars are much more distant than the planets, it is laughable to imagine the planets&#x27; effect on human affairs should depend on their position with respect to the zodiac. He also argues that the interpretation of the Moon&#x27;s conjunction with a planet as good when the moon is full, but bad when the moon is waning, is clearly wrong, as from the Moon&#x27;s point of view, half of its surface is always in sunlight; and from the planet&#x27;s point of view, waning should be better, as then the planet sees some light from the Moon, but when the Moon is full to us, it is dark, and therefore bad, on the side facing the planet in question.

=== Hellenistic Egypt ===

In 525 BCE, Egypt was conquered by the Persians. The 1st century BCE Egyptian Dendera Zodiac shares two signs – the Balance and the Scorpion – with Mesopotamian astrology.

With the occupation by Alexander the Great in 332 BCE, Egypt became Hellenistic. The city of Alexandria was founded by Alexander after the conquest, becoming the place where Babylonian astrology was mixed with Egyptian Decanic astrology to create Horoscopic astrology. This contained the Babylonian zodiac with its system of planetary exaltations, the triplicities of the signs and the importance of eclipses. It used the Egyptian concept of dividing the zodiac into thirty-six decans of ten degrees each, with an emphasis on the rising decan, and the Greek system of planetary Gods, sign rulership and four elements. 2nd century BCE texts predict positions of planets in zodiac signs at the time of the rising of certain decans, particularly Sothis. The astrologer and astronomer Ptolemy lived in Alexandria. Ptolemy&#x27;s work the &quot;Tetrabiblos&quot; formed the basis of Western astrology, and, &quot;...enjoyed almost the authority of a Bible among the astrological writers of a thousand years or more.&quot;

=== Greece and Rome ===

The conquest of Asia by Alexander the Great exposed the Greeks to ideas from Syria, Babylon, Persia and central Asia. Around 280 BCE, Berossus, a priest of Bel from Babylon, moved to the Greek island of Kos, teaching astrology and Babylonian culture. By the 1st century BCE, there were two varieties of astrology, one using horoscopes to describe the past, present and future; the other, theurgic, emphasising the soul&#x27;s ascent to the stars. Greek influence played a crucial role in the transmission of astrological theory to Rome.

The first definite reference to astrology in Rome comes from the orator Cato, who in 160 BCE warned farm overseers against consulting with Chaldeans, who were described as Babylonian &#x27;star-gazers&#x27;. Among both Greeks and Romans, Babylonia (also known as Chaldea) became so identified with astrology that &#x27;Chaldean wisdom&#x27; became synonymous with divination using planets and stars. The 2nd-century Roman poet and satirist Juvenal complains about the pervasive influence of Chaldeans, saying, &quot;Still more trusted are the Chaldaeans; every word uttered by the astrologer they will believe has come from Hammon&#x27;s fountain.&quot;

One of the first astrologers to bring Hermetic astrology to Rome was Thrasyllus, astrologer to the emperor Tiberius, the first emperor to have had a court astrologer, though his predecessor Augustus had used astrology to help legitimise his Imperial rights.

=== Medieval world ===

==== Hindu ====
The main texts upon which classical Indian astrology is based are early medieval compilations, notably the &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Sārāvalī&quot; by .
The &quot;Horāshastra&quot; is a composite work of 71 chapters, of which the first part (chapters 1–51) dates to the 7th to early 8th centuries and the second part (chapters 52–71) to the later 8th century. The &quot;Sārāvalī&quot; likewise dates to around 800 CE. English translations of these texts were published by N.N. Krishna Rau and V.B. Choudhari in 1963 and 1961, respectively.

==== Islamic ====


Astrology was taken up by Islamic scholars following the collapse of Alexandria to the Arabs in the 7th century, and the founding of the Abbasid empire in the 8th. The second Abbasid caliph, Al Mansur (754–775) founded the city of Baghdad to act as a centre of learning, and included in its design a library-translation centre known as &quot;Bayt al-Hikma&quot; &#x27;House of Wisdom&#x27;, which continued to receive development from his heirs and was to provide a major impetus for Arabic-Persian translations of Hellenistic astrological texts. The early translators included Mashallah, who helped to elect the time for the foundation of Baghdad, and Sahl ibn Bishr, (&quot;a.k.a.&quot; &quot;Zael&quot;), whose texts were directly influential upon later European astrologers such as Guido Bonatti in the 13th century, and William Lilly in the 17th century. Knowledge of Arabic texts started to become imported into Europe during the Latin translations of the 12th century.

==== Europe ====



In the seventh century, Isidore of Seville argued in his &quot;Etymologiae&quot; that astronomy described the movements of the heavens, while astrology had two parts: one was scientific, describing the movements of the Sun, the Moon and the stars, while the other, making predictions, was theologically erroneous.

The first astrological book published in Europe was the &quot;Liber Planetis et Mundi Climatibus&quot; (&quot;Book of the Planets and Regions of the World&quot;), which appeared between 1010 and 1027 AD, and may have been authored by Gerbert of Aurillac. Ptolemy&#x27;s second century AD &quot;Tetrabiblos&quot; was translated into Latin by Plato of Tivoli in 1138. The Dominican theologian Thomas Aquinas followed Aristotle in proposing that the stars ruled the imperfect &#x27;sublunary&#x27; body, while attempting to reconcile astrology with Christianity by stating that God ruled the soul. The thirteenth century mathematician Campanus of Novara is said to have devised a system of astrological houses that divides the prime vertical into &#x27;houses&#x27; of equal 30° arcs, though the system was used earlier in the East. The thirteenth century astronomer Guido Bonatti wrote a textbook, the &quot;Liber Astronomicus&quot;, a copy of which King Henry VII of England owned at the end of the fifteenth century.

In &quot;Paradiso&quot;, the final part of the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, the Italian poet Dante Alighieri referred &quot;in countless details&quot; to the astrological planets, though he adapted traditional astrology to suit his Christian viewpoint, for example using astrological thinking in his prophecies of the reform of Christendom.

John Gower in the fourteenth century defined astrology as essentially limited to the making of predictions. The influence of the stars was in turn divided into natural astrology, with for example effects on tides and the growth of plants, and judicial astrology, with supposedly predictable effects on people. The fourteenth-century sceptic Nicole Oresme however included astronomy as a part of astrology in his &quot;Livre de divinacions&quot;. Oresme argued that current approaches to prediction of events such as plagues, wars, and weather were inappropriate, but that such prediction was a valid field of inquiry. However, he attacked the use of astrology to choose the timing of actions (so-called interrogation and election) as wholly false, and rejected the determination of human action by the stars on grounds of free will. The friar Laurens Pignon (c. 1368–1449) similarly rejected all forms of divination and determinism, including by the stars, in his 1411 &quot;Contre les Devineurs&quot;. This was in opposition to the tradition carried by the Arab astronomer Albumasar (787–886) whose &quot;Introductorium in Astronomiam&quot; and &quot;De Magnis Coniunctionibus&quot; argued the view that both individual actions and larger scale history are determined by the stars.

In the late 15th century, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola forcefully attacked astrology in &quot;Disputationes contra Astrologos&quot;, arguing that the heavens neither caused, nor heralded earthly events. His contemporary, Pietro Pomponazzi, a &quot;rationalistic and critical thinker&quot;, was much more sanguine about astrology and critical of Pico&#x27;s attack.

=== Renaissance and Early Modern ===

Renaissance scholars commonly practised astrology. Gerolamo Cardano cast the horoscope of king Edward VI of England, while John Dee was the personal astrologer to queen Elizabeth I of England. Catherine de Medici paid Michael Nostradamus in 1566 to verify the prediction of the death of her husband, king Henry II of France made by her astrologer Lucus Gauricus. Major astronomers who practised as court astrologers included Tycho Brahe in the royal court of Denmark, Johannes Kepler to the Habsburgs, Galileo Galilei to the Medici, and Giordano Bruno who was burnt at the stake for heresy in Rome in 1600. The distinction between astrology and astronomy was not entirely clear. Advances in astronomy were often motivated by the desire to improve the accuracy of astrology. Kepler, for example, was driven by a belief in harmonies between Earthly and celestial affairs, yet he disparaged the activities of most astrologers as &quot;evil-smelling dung&quot;.

Ephemerides with complex astrological calculations, and almanacs interpreting celestial events for use in medicine and for choosing times to plant crops, were popular in Elizabethan England. In 1597, the English mathematician and physician Thomas Hood made a set of paper instruments that used revolving overlays to help students work out relationships between fixed stars or constellations, the midheaven, and the twelve astrological houses. Hood&#x27;s instruments also illustrated, for pedagogical purposes, the supposed relationships between the signs of the zodiac, the planets, and the parts of the human body adherents believed were governed by the planets and signs. While Hood&#x27;s presentation was innovative, his astrological information was largely standard and was taken from Gerard Mercator&#x27;s astrological disc made in 1551, or a source used by Mercator. Despite its popularity, Renaissance astrology had what historian Gabor Almasi calls &quot;elite debate&quot;, exemplified by the polemical letters of Swiss physician Thomas Erastus who fought against astrology, calling it &quot;vanity&quot; and &quot;superstition.&quot; Then around the time of the new star of 1572 and the comet of 1577 there began what Almasi calls an &quot;extended epistemological reform&quot; which began the process of excluding religion, astrology and anthropocentrism from scientific debate. By 1679, the yearly publication La Connoissance des temps eschewed astrology as a legitimate topic.

=== Enlightenment period and onwards ===

During the Enlightenment, intellectual sympathy for astrology fell away, leaving only a popular following supported by cheap almanacs. One English almanac compiler, Richard Saunders, followed the spirit of the age by printing a derisive &quot;Discourse on the Invalidity of Astrology&quot;, while in France Pierre Bayle&#x27;s &quot;Dictionnaire&quot; of 1697 stated that the subject was puerile. The Anglo-Irish satirist Jonathan Swift ridiculed the Whig political astrologer John Partridge.

In the second half of the 17th century, the Society of Astrologers (1647–1684), a trade, educational, and social organization, sought to unite London&#x27;s often fractious astrologers in the task of revitalizing astrology. Following the template of the popular &quot;Feasts of Mathematicians&quot; they endeavored to defend their art in the face of growing religious criticism. The Society hosted banquets, exchanged &quot;instruments and manuscripts&quot;, proposed research projects, and funded the publication of sermons that depicted astrology as a legitimate biblical pursuit for Christians. They commissioned sermons that argued Astrology was divine, Hebraic, and scripturally supported by Bible passages about the Magi and the sons of Seth. According to historian Michelle Pfeffer, &quot;The society&#x27;s public relations campaign ultimately failed.&quot; Modern historians have mostly neglected the Society of Astrologers in favor of the still extant Royal Society (1660), even though both organizations initially had some of the same members.

Astrology saw a popular revival starting in the 19th century, as part of a general revival of spiritualism and—later, New Age philosophy, and through the influence of mass media such as newspaper horoscopes. Early in the 20th century the psychiatrist Carl Jung developed some concepts concerning astrology, which led to the development of psychological astrology.

== Principles and practice ==
Advocates have defined astrology as a symbolic language, an art form, a science, and a method of divination. Though most cultural astrology systems share common roots in ancient philosophies that influenced each other, many use methods that differ from those in the West. These include Hindu astrology (also known as &quot;Indian astrology&quot; and in modern times referred to as &quot;Vedic astrology&quot;) and Chinese astrology, both of which have influenced the world&#x27;s cultural history.

=== Western ===
Western astrology is a form of divination based on the construction of a horoscope for an exact moment, such as a person&#x27;s birth. It uses the tropical zodiac, which is aligned to the equinoctial points.

Western astrology is founded on the movements and relative positions of celestial bodies such as the Sun, Moon and planets, which are analysed by their movement through signs of the zodiac (twelve spatial divisions of the ecliptic) and by their aspects (based on geometric angles) relative to one another. They are also considered by their placement in houses (twelve spatial divisions of the sky). Astrology&#x27;s modern representation in western popular media is usually reduced to sun sign astrology, which considers only the zodiac sign of the Sun at an individual&#x27;s date of birth, and represents only 1/12 of the total chart.

The horoscope visually expresses the set of relationships for the time and place of the chosen event. These relationships are between the seven &#x27;planets&#x27;, signifying tendencies such as war and love; the twelve signs of the zodiac; and the twelve houses. Each planet is in a particular sign and a particular house at the chosen time, when observed from the chosen place, creating two kinds of relationship. A third kind is the aspect of each planet to every other planet, where for example two planets 120° apart (in &#x27;trine&#x27;) are in a harmonious relationship, but two planets 90° apart (&#x27;square&#x27;) are in a conflicted relationship. Together these relationships and their interpretations are said to form &quot;...the language of the heavens speaking to learned men.&quot;

Along with tarot divination, astrology is one of the core studies of Western esotericism, and as such has influenced systems of magical belief not only among Western esotericists and Hermeticists, but also belief systems such as Wicca, which have borrowed from or been influenced by the Western esoteric tradition. Tanya Luhrmann has said that &quot;all magicians know something about astrology,&quot; and refers to a table of correspondences in Starhawk&#x27;s &quot;The Spiral Dance&quot;, organised by planet, as an example of the astrological lore studied by magicians.

=== Hindu ===


The earliest Vedic text on astronomy is the &quot;Vedanga Jyotisha&quot;; Vedic thought later came to include astrology as well.

Hindu natal astrology originated with Hellenistic astrology by the 3rd century BCE, though incorporating the Hindu lunar mansions. The names of the signs (e.g. Greek &#x27;Krios&#x27; for Aries, Hindi &#x27;Kriya&#x27;), the planets (e.g. Greek &#x27;Helios&#x27; for Sun, astrological Hindi &#x27;Heli&#x27;), and astrological terms (e.g. Greek &#x27;apoklima&#x27; and &#x27;sunaphe&#x27; for declination and planetary conjunction, Hindi &#x27;apoklima&#x27; and &#x27;sunapha&#x27; respectively) in Varaha Mihira&#x27;s texts are considered conclusive evidence of a Greek origin for Hindu astrology. The Indian techniques may also have been augmented with some of the Babylonian techniques.

=== Chinese and East Asian ===

Chinese astrology has a close relation with Chinese philosophy (theory of the three harmonies: heaven, earth and man) and uses concepts such as yin and yang, the Five phases, the 10 Celestial stems, the 12 Earthly Branches, and shichen (時辰 a form of timekeeping used for religious purposes). The early use of Chinese astrology was mainly confined to political astrology, the observation of unusual phenomena, identification of portents and the selection of auspicious days for events and decisions.

The constellations of the Zodiac of western Asia and Europe were not used; instead the sky is divided into Three Enclosures (三垣 sān yuán), and Twenty-Eight Mansions (二十八宿 èrshíbā xiù) in twelve Ci (十二次). The Chinese zodiac of twelve animal signs is said to represent twelve different types of personality. It is based on cycles of years, lunar months, and two-hour periods of the day (the shichen). The zodiac traditionally begins with the sign of the Rat, and the cycle proceeds through 11 other animal signs: the Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Pig. Complex systems of predicting fate and destiny based on one&#x27;s birthday, birth season, and birth hours, such as &quot;ziping&quot; and Zi Wei Dou Shu () are still used regularly in modern-day Chinese astrology. They do not rely on direct observations of the stars.

The Korean zodiac is identical to the Chinese one. The Vietnamese zodiac is almost identical to the Chinese, except for second animal being the &quot;Water Buffalo&quot; instead of the &quot;Ox&quot;, and the fourth animal the &quot;Cat&quot; instead of the &quot;Rabbit&quot;. The Japanese have since 1873 celebrated the beginning of the new year on 1 January as per the Gregorian calendar. The Thai zodiac begins, not at Chinese New Year, but either on the first day of the fifth month in the Thai lunar calendar, or during the Songkran festival (now celebrated every 13–15 April), depending on the purpose of the use.

== Theological viewpoints ==

=== Ancient ===
Augustine (354430) believed that the determinism of astrology conflicted with the Christian doctrines of man&#x27;s free will and responsibility, and God not being the cause of evil, but he also grounded his opposition philosophically, citing the failure of astrology to explain twins who behave differently although conceived at the same moment and born at approximately the same time.

=== Medieval ===

Some of the practices of astrology were contested on theological grounds by medieval Muslim astronomers such as Al-Farabi (Alpharabius), Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) and Avicenna. They said that the methods of astrologers conflicted with orthodox religious views of Islamic scholars, by suggesting that the Will of God can be known and predicted. For example, Avicenna&#x27;s &#x27;Refutation against astrology&#x27;, &quot;Risāla fī ibṭāl aḥkām al-nojūm&quot;, argues against the practice of astrology while supporting the principle that planets may act as agents of divine causation. Avicenna considered that the movement of the planets influenced life on earth in a deterministic way, but argued against the possibility of determining the exact influence of the stars. Essentially, Avicenna did not deny the core dogma of astrology, but denied our ability to understand it to the extent that precise and fatalistic predictions could be made from it. Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya (1292–1350), in his &quot;Miftah Dar al-SaCadah&quot;, also used physical arguments in astronomy to question the practice of judicial astrology. He recognised that the stars are much larger than the planets, and argued: And if you astrologers answer that it is precisely because of this distance and smallness that their influences are negligible, then why is it that you claim a great influence for the smallest heavenly body, Mercury? Why is it that you have given an influence to [the head] and [the tail], which are two imaginary points [ascending and descending nodes]?

=== Modern ===
Martin Luther denounced astrology in his &quot;Table Talk&quot;. He asked why twins like Esau and Jacob had two different natures yet were born at the same time. Luther also compared astrologers to those who say their dice will always land on a certain number. Although the dice may roll on the number a couple of times, the predictor is silent for all the times the dice fails to land on that number.

The Catechism of the Catholic Church maintains that divination, including predictive astrology, is incompatible with modern Catholic beliefs such as free will:

== Scientific analysis and criticism ==


The scientific community rejects astrology as having no explanatory power for describing the universe, and considers it a pseudoscience. Scientific testing of astrology has been conducted, and no evidence has been found to support any of the premises or purported effects outlined in astrological traditions. There is no proposed mechanism of action by which the positions and motions of stars and planets could affect people and events on Earth that does not contradict basic and well understood aspects of biology and physics. Those who have faith in astrology have been characterised by scientists including Bart J. Bok as doing so &quot;...in spite of the fact that there is no verified scientific basis for their beliefs, and indeed that there is strong evidence to the contrary&quot;.

Confirmation bias is a form of cognitive bias, a psychological factor that contributes to belief in astrology. Astrology believers tend to selectively remember predictions that turn out to be true, and do not remember those that turn out false. Another, separate, form of confirmation bias also plays a role, where believers often fail to distinguish between messages that demonstrate special ability and those that do not. Thus there are two distinct forms of confirmation bias that are under study with respect to astrological belief.

=== Demarcation ===

Under the criterion of falsifiability, first proposed by the philosopher of science Karl Popper, astrology is a pseudoscience. Popper regarded astrology as &quot;pseudo-empirical&quot; in that &quot;it appeals to observation and experiment,&quot; but &quot;nevertheless does not come up to scientific standards.&quot; In contrast to scientific disciplines, astrology has not responded to falsification through experiment.

In contrast to Popper, the philosopher Thomas Kuhn argued that it was not lack of falsifiability that makes astrology unscientific, but rather that the process and concepts of astrology are non-empirical. Kuhn thought that, though astrologers had, historically, made predictions that categorically failed, this in itself does not make astrology unscientific, nor do attempts by astrologers to explain away failures by saying that creating a horoscope is very difficult. Rather, in Kuhn&#x27;s eyes, astrology is not science because it was always more akin to medieval medicine; astrologers followed a sequence of rules and guidelines for a seemingly necessary field with known shortcomings, but they did no research because the fields are not amenable to research, and so &quot;they had no puzzles to solve and therefore no science to practise.&quot; While an astronomer could correct for failure, an astrologer could not. An astrologer could only explain away failure but could not revise the astrological hypothesis in a meaningful way. As such, to Kuhn, even if the stars could influence the path of humans through life, astrology is not scientific.

The philosopher Paul Thagard asserts that astrology cannot be regarded as falsified in this sense until it has been replaced with a successor. In the case of predicting behaviour, psychology is the alternative. To Thagard a further criterion of demarcation of science from pseudoscience is that the state-of-the-art must progress and that the community of researchers should be attempting to compare the current theory to alternatives, and not be &quot;selective in considering confirmations and disconfirmations.&quot; Progress is defined here as explaining new phenomena and solving existing problems, yet astrology has failed to progress having only changed little in nearly 2000 years. To Thagard, astrologers are acting as though engaged in normal science believing that the foundations of astrology were well established despite the &quot;many unsolved problems&quot;, and in the face of better alternative theories (psychology). For these reasons Thagard views astrology as pseudoscience.

For the philosopher Edward W. James, astrology is irrational not because of the numerous problems with mechanisms and falsification due to experiments, but because an analysis of the astrological literature shows that it is infused with fallacious logic and poor reasoning.

=== Effectiveness ===

Astrology has not demonstrated its effectiveness in controlled studies and has no scientific validity. Where it has made falsifiable predictions under controlled conditions, they have been falsified. One famous experiment included 28 astrologers who were asked to match over a hundred natal charts to psychological profiles generated by the California Psychological Inventory (CPI) questionnaire. The double-blind experimental protocol used in this study was agreed upon by a group of physicists and a group of astrologers nominated by the National Council for Geocosmic Research, who advised the experimenters, helped ensure that the test was fair and helped draw the central proposition of natal astrology to be tested. They also chose 26 out of the 28 astrologers for the tests (two more volunteered afterwards). The study, published in &quot;Nature&quot; in 1985, found that predictions based on natal astrology were no better than chance, and that the testing &quot;...clearly refutes the astrological hypothesis.&quot;

In 1955, the astrologer and psychologist Michel Gauquelin stated that though he had failed to find evidence that supported indicators like zodiacal signs and planetary aspects in astrology, he did find positive correlations between the diurnal positions of some planets and success in professions that astrology traditionally associates with those planets. The best-known of Gauquelin&#x27;s findings is based on the positions of Mars in the natal charts of successful athletes and became known as the &quot;Mars effect&quot;. A study conducted by seven French scientists attempted to replicate the claim, but found no statistical evidence. They attributed the effect to selective bias on Gauquelin&#x27;s part, accusing him of attempting to persuade them to add or delete names from their study.

Geoffrey Dean has suggested that the effect may be caused by self-reporting of birth dates by parents rather than any issue with the study by Gauquelin. The suggestion is that a small subset of the parents may have had changed birth times to be consistent with better astrological charts for a related profession. The number of births under astrologically undesirable conditions was also lower, indicating that parents choose dates and times to suit their beliefs. The sample group was taken from a time where belief in astrology was more common. Gauquelin had failed to find the Mars effect in more recent populations, where a nurse or doctor recorded the birth information.

Dean, a scientist and former astrologer, and psychologist Ivan Kelly conducted a large scale scientific test that involved more than one hundred cognitive, behavioural, physical, and other variables—but found no support for astrology. Furthermore, a meta-analysis pooled 40 studies that involved 700 astrologers and over 1,000 birth charts. Ten of the tests—which involved 300 participants—had the astrologers pick the correct chart interpretation out of a number of others that were not the astrologically correct chart interpretation (usually three to five others). When date and other obvious clues were removed, no significant results suggested there was any preferred chart.

=== Lack of mechanisms and consistency ===
Testing the validity of astrology can be difficult, because there is no consensus amongst astrologers as to what astrology is or what it can predict. Most professional astrologers are paid to predict the future or describe a person&#x27;s personality and life, but most horoscopes only make vague untestable statements that can apply to almost anyone.

Many astrologers believe that astrology is scientific, while some have proposed conventional causal agents such as electromagnetism and gravity. Scientists reject these mechanisms as implausible since, for example, the magnetic field, when measured from Earth, of a large but distant planet such as Jupiter is far smaller than that produced by ordinary household appliances.

Western astrology has taken the earth&#x27;s axial precession (also called precession of the equinoxes) into account since Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot;, so the &quot;first point of Aries&quot;, the start of the astrological year, continually moves against the background of the stars. The tropical zodiac has no connection to the stars; tropical astrologers distinguish the constellations from their historically associated sign, thereby avoiding complications involving precession. Charpak and Broch, noting this, referred to astrology based on the tropical zodiac as being &quot;...empty boxes that have nothing to do with anything and are devoid of any consistency or correspondence with the stars.&quot; Sole use of the tropical zodiac is inconsistent with references made, by the same astrologers, to the Age of Aquarius, which depends on when the vernal point enters the constellation of Aquarius.

Astrologers usually have only a small knowledge of astronomy, and often do not take into account basic principles—such as the precession of the equinoxes, which changes the position of the sun with time. They commented on the example of Élizabeth Teissier, who wrote that, &quot;The sun ends up in the same place in the sky on the same date each year&quot;, as the basis for the idea that two people with the same birthday, but a number of years apart, should be under the same planetary influence. Charpak and Broch noted that, &quot;There is a difference of about twenty-two thousand miles between Earth&#x27;s location on any specific date in two successive years&quot;, and that thus they should not be under the same influence according to astrology. Over a 40-year period there would be a difference greater than 780,000 miles.

=== Reception in the social sciences ===

The general consensus of astronomers and other natural scientists is that astrology is a pseudoscience which carries no predictive capability, with many philosophers of science considering it a &quot;paradigm or prime example of pseudoscience.&quot; Some scholars in the social sciences have cautioned against categorizing astrology, especially ancient astrology, as &quot;just&quot; a pseudoscience or projecting the distinction backwards into the past. Thagard, while demarcating it as a pseudoscience, notes that astrology &quot;should be judged as not pseudoscientific in classical or Renaissance times...Only when the historical and social aspects of science are neglected does it become plausible that pseudoscience is an unchanging category.&quot; Historians of science such as Tamsyn Barton, Roger Beck, Francesca Rochberg, and Wouter J. Hanegraaff argue that such a wholesale description is anachronistic when applied to historical contexts, stressing that astrology was not pseudoscience before the 18th century and the importance of the discipline to the development of medieval science. R. J. Hakinson writes in the context of Hellenistic astrology that &quot;the belief in the possibility of [astrology] was, at least some of the time, the result of careful reflection on the nature and structure of the universe.&quot;

Nicholas Campion, both an astrologer and academic historian of astrology, argues that Indigenous astronomy is largely used as a synonym for astrology in academia, and that modern Indian and Western astrology are better understood as modes of cultural astronomy or ethnoastronomy. Roy Willis and Patrick Curry draw a distinction between propositional &quot;&quot; and metaphoric &quot;&quot; in the ancient world, identifying astrology with the latter and noting that the central concern of astrology &quot;is not knowledge (factual, let alone scientific) but (ethical, spiritual and pragmatic)&quot;. Similarly, historian of science Justin Niermeier-Dohoney writes that astrology was &quot;more than simply a science of prediction using the stars and comprised a vast body of beliefs, knowledge, and practices with the overarching theme of understanding the relationship between humanity and the rest of the cosmos through an interpretation of stellar, solar, lunar, and planetary movement.&quot; Scholars such as Assyriologist Matthew Rutz have begun using the term &quot;astral knowledge&quot; rather than astrology &quot;to better describe a category of beliefs and practices much broader than the term &#x27;astrology&#x27; can capture.&quot;

== Cultural impact ==

=== Western politics and society ===

In the West, political leaders have sometimes consulted astrologers. For example, the British intelligence agency MI5 employed Louis de Wohl as an astrologer after it was reported that Adolf Hitler used astrology to time his actions. The War Office was &quot;...interested to know what Hitler&#x27;s own astrologers would be telling him from week to week.&quot; In fact, de Wohl&#x27;s predictions were so inaccurate that he was soon labelled a &quot;complete charlatan&quot;, and later evidence showed that Hitler considered astrology &quot;complete nonsense&quot;. After John Hinckley&#x27;s attempted assassination of US President Ronald Reagan, first lady Nancy Reagan commissioned astrologer Joan Quigley to act as the secret White House astrologer. However, Quigley&#x27;s role ended in 1988 when it became public through the memoirs of former chief of staff, Donald Regan.

There was a boom in interest in astrology in the late 1960s. The sociologist Marcello Truzzi described three levels of involvement of &quot;Astrology-believers&quot; to account for its revived popularity in the face of scientific discrediting. He found that most astrology-believers did not think that it was a scientific explanation with predictive power. Instead, those superficially involved, knowing &quot;next to nothing&quot; about astrology&#x27;s &#x27;mechanics&#x27;, read newspaper astrology columns, and could benefit from &quot;tension-management of anxieties&quot; and &quot;a cognitive belief-system that transcends science.&quot; Those at the second level usually had their horoscopes cast and sought advice and predictions. They were much younger than those at the first level, and could benefit from knowledge of the language of astrology and the resulting ability to belong to a coherent and exclusive group. Those at the third level were highly involved and usually cast horoscopes for themselves. Astrology provided this small minority of astrology-believers with a &quot;&quot;meaningful&quot; view of their universe and [gave] them an &quot;understanding&quot; of their place in it.&quot; This third group took astrology seriously, possibly as an overarching religious worldview (a &quot;sacred canopy&quot;, in Peter L. Berger&#x27;s phrase), whereas the other two groups took it playfully and irreverently.

In 1953, the sociologist Theodor W. Adorno conducted a study of the astrology column of a Los Angeles newspaper as part of a project examining mass culture in capitalist society. Adorno believed that popular astrology, as a device, invariably leads to statements that encouraged conformity—and that astrologers who go against conformity, by discouraging performance at work etc., risk losing their jobs. Adorno concluded that astrology is a large-scale manifestation of systematic irrationalism, where individuals are subtly led—through flattery and vague generalisations—to believe that the author of the column is addressing them directly. Adorno drew a parallel with the phrase opium of the people, by Karl Marx, by commenting, &quot;occultism is the metaphysic of the dopes.&quot;

A 2005 Gallup poll and a 2009 survey by the Pew Research Center reported that 25% of US adults believe in astrology, while a 2018 Pew survey found a figure of 29%. According to data released in the National Science Foundation&#x27;s 2014 &quot;Science and Engineering Indicators&quot; study, &quot;Fewer Americans rejected astrology in 2012 than in recent years.&quot; The NSF study noted that in 2012, &quot;slightly more than half of Americans said that astrology was &#x27;not at all scientific,&#x27; whereas nearly two-thirds gave this response in 2010. The comparable percentage has not been this low since 1983.&quot; Astrology apps became popular in the late 2010s, some receiving millions of dollars in Silicon Valley venture capital.

=== India and Japan ===

In India, there is a long-established and widespread belief in astrology. It is commonly used for daily life, particularly in matters concerning marriage and career, and makes extensive use of electional, horary and karmic astrology. Indian politics have also been influenced by astrology. It is still considered a branch of the Vedanga. In 2001, Indian scientists and politicians debated and critiqued a proposal to use state money to fund research into astrology, resulting in permission for Indian universities to offer courses in Vedic astrology.

In February 2011, the Bombay High Court reaffirmed astrology&#x27;s standing in India when it dismissed a case that challenged its status as a science.

In Japan, strong belief in astrology has led to dramatic changes in the fertility rate and the number of abortions in the years of Fire Horse. Adherents believe that women born in &quot;hinoeuma&quot; years are unmarriageable and bring bad luck to their father or husband. In 1966, the number of babies born in Japan dropped by over 25% as parents tried to avoid the stigma of having a daughter born in the hinoeuma year.

=== Literature and music ===
The fourteenth-century English poets John Gower and Geoffrey Chaucer both referred to astrology in their works, including Gower&#x27;s &quot;Confessio Amantis&quot; and Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;. Chaucer commented explicitly on astrology in his &quot;Treatise on the Astrolabe&quot;, demonstrating personal knowledge of one area, judicial astrology, with an account of how to find the ascendant or rising sign.

In the fifteenth century, references to astrology, such as with similes, became &quot;a matter of course&quot; in English literature.

In the sixteenth century, John Lyly&#x27;s 1597 play, &quot;The Woman in the Moon&quot;, is wholly motivated by astrology, while Christopher Marlowe makes astrological references in his plays &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot; and &quot;Tamburlaine&quot; (both c. 1590), and Sir Philip Sidney refers to astrology at least four times in his romance &quot;The Countess of Pembroke&#x27;s Arcadia&quot; (c. 1580). Edmund Spenser uses astrology both decoratively and causally in his poetry, revealing &quot;...unmistakably an abiding interest in the art, an interest shared by a large number of his contemporaries.&quot; George Chapman&#x27;s play, &quot;Byron&#x27;s Conspiracy&quot; (1608), similarly uses astrology as a causal mechanism in the drama. William Shakespeare&#x27;s attitude towards astrology is unclear, with contradictory references in plays including &quot;King Lear&quot;, &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, and &quot;Richard II&quot;. Shakespeare was familiar with astrology and made use of his knowledge of astrology in nearly every play he wrote, assuming a basic familiarity with the subject in his commercial audience. Outside theatre, the physician and mystic Robert Fludd practised astrology, as did the quack doctor Simon Forman. In Elizabethan England, &quot;The usual feeling about astrology ... [was] that it is the most useful of the sciences.&quot;

In seventeenth century Spain, Lope de Vega, with a detailed knowledge of astronomy, wrote plays that ridicule astrology. In his pastoral romance &quot;La Arcadia&quot; (1598), it leads to absurdity; in his novela &quot;Guzman el Bravo&quot; (1624), he concludes that the stars were made for man, not man for the stars. Calderón de la Barca wrote the 1641 comedy &quot;Astrologo Fingido&quot; (The Pretended Astrologer); the plot was borrowed by the French playwright Thomas Corneille for his 1651 comedy &quot;Feint Astrologue&quot;.
The most famous piece of music influenced by astrology is the orchestral suite &quot;The Planets&quot;. Written by the British composer Gustav Holst (1874–1934), and first performed in 1918, the framework of &quot;The Planets&quot; is based upon the astrological symbolism of the planets. Each of the seven movements of the suite is based upon a different planet, though the movements are not in the order of the planets from the Sun. The composer Colin Matthews wrote an eighth movement entitled &quot;Pluto, the Renewer&quot;, first performed in 2000, as the suite was written prior to Pluto&#x27;s discovery. In 1937, another British composer, Constant Lambert, wrote a ballet on astrological themes, called &quot;Horoscope&quot;. In 1974, the New Zealand composer Edwin Carr wrote &quot;The Twelve Signs: An Astrological Entertainment&quot; for orchestra without strings. Camille Paglia acknowledges astrology as an influence on her work of literary criticism &quot;Sexual Personae&quot; (1990). The American comedian Harvey Sid Fisher is best known for his comedic songs about astrology.

Astrology features strongly in Eleanor Catton&#x27;s &quot;The Luminaries&quot;, recipient of the 2013 Man Booker Prize.

<text>In mathematics, an algebraic extension is a field extension such that every element of the larger field is algebraic over the smaller field ; that is, every element of is a root of a non-zero polynomial with coefficients in . A field extension that is not algebraic, is said to be transcendental, and must contain transcendental elements, that is, elements that are not algebraic.

The algebraic extensions of the field formula_1 of the rational numbers are called algebraic number fields and are the main objects of study of algebraic number theory. Another example of a common algebraic extension is the extension formula_2 of the real numbers by the complex numbers.

==Some properties==
All transcendental extensions are of infinite degree. This in turn implies that all finite extensions are algebraic. The converse is not true however: there are infinite extensions which are algebraic. For instance, the field of all algebraic numbers is an infinite algebraic extension of the rational numbers.

Let be an extension field of , and . The smallest subfield of that contains and is commonly denoted formula_3 If is algebraic over , then the elements of can be expressed as polynomials in with coefficients in &quot;K&quot;; that is, formula_4, the smallest ring containing and . In this case, formula_5 is a finite extension of and all its elements are algebraic over . In particular, formula_5 is a -vector space with basis formula_7, where &quot;d&quot; is the degree of the minimal polynomial of . These properties do not hold if is not algebraic. For example, formula_8 and they are both infinite dimensional vector spaces over formula_9

An algebraically closed field &quot;F&quot; has no proper algebraic extensions, that is, no algebraic extensions &quot;E&quot; with &quot;F&quot; &lt; &quot;E&quot;. An example is the field of complex numbers. Every field has an algebraic extension which is algebraically closed (called its algebraic closure), but proving this in general requires some form of the axiom of choice.

An extension &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot; is algebraic if and only if every sub &quot;K&quot;-algebra of &quot;L&quot; is a field.

==Properties==
The following three properties hold:
# If &quot;E&quot; is an algebraic extension of &quot;F&quot; and &quot;F&quot; is an algebraic extension of &quot;K&quot; then &quot;E&quot; is an algebraic extension of &quot;K&quot;.
# If &quot;E&quot; and &quot;F&quot; are algebraic extensions of &quot;K&quot; in a common overfield &quot;C&quot;, then the compositum &quot;EF&quot; is an algebraic extension of &quot;K&quot;.
# If &quot;E&quot; is an algebraic extension of &quot;F&quot; and &quot;E&quot; &gt; &quot;K&quot; &gt; &quot;F&quot; then &quot;E&quot; is an algebraic extension of &quot;K&quot;.

These finitary results can be generalized using transfinite induction:

This fact, together with Zorn&#x27;s lemma (applied to an appropriately chosen poset), establishes the existence of algebraic closures.

==Generalizations==

Model theory generalizes the notion of algebraic extension to arbitrary theories: an embedding of &quot;M&quot; into &quot;N&quot; is called an algebraic extension if for every &quot;x&quot; in &quot;N&quot; there is a formula &quot;p&quot; with parameters in &quot;M&quot;, such that &quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is true and the set

:formula_10

is finite. It turns out that applying this definition to the theory of fields gives the usual definition of algebraic extension. The Galois group of &quot;N&quot; over &quot;M&quot; can again be defined as the group of automorphisms, and it turns out that most of the theory of Galois groups can be developed for the general case.

== Relative algebraic closures ==
Given a field &quot;k&quot; and a field &quot;K&quot; containing &quot;k&quot;, one defines the relative algebraic closure of &quot;k&quot; in &quot;K&quot; to be the subfield of &quot;K&quot; consisting of all elements of &quot;K&quot; that are algebraic over &quot;k&quot;, that is all elements of &quot;K&quot; that are a root of some nonzero polynomial with coefficients in &quot;k&quot;.

<text>Angela Maria &quot;Ani&quot; DiFranco (; born September 23, 1970) is an American-Canadian singer-songwriter. She has released more than 20 albums. DiFranco&#x27;s music has been classified as folk rock and alternative rock, although it has additional influences from punk, funk, hip hop and jazz. She has released all her albums on her own record label, Righteous Babe.

DiFranco supports many social and political movements by performing benefit concerts, appearing on benefit albums and speaking at rallies. Through the Righteous Babe Foundation, DiFranco has backed grassroots cultural and political organizations supporting causes including abortion rights and LGBT visibility. She counts American folk singer and songwriter Pete Seeger among her mentors.

DiFranco released a memoir, &quot;No Walls and the Recurring Dream&quot;, on May 7, 2019, via Viking Books and made &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

On February 9, 2024, DiFranco made her Broadway debut in &quot;Hadestown&quot; as Persephone, reprising the role she played in the concept album of the same name.

==Early life and education==
DiFranco was born in Buffalo, New York, on September 23, 1970, the daughter of Elizabeth (Ross) and Dante Americo DiFranco, who had met while attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Her father was of Italian descent, and her mother was from Montreal. DiFranco started playing Beatles covers at local bars and busking with her guitar teacher, Michael Meldrum, at the age of nine. By 14 she was writing her own songs. She played them at bars and coffee houses throughout her teens. DiFranco graduated from the Buffalo Academy for Visual and Performing Arts high school at 16 and began attending classes at Buffalo State College. She was living by herself, having moved out of her mother&#x27;s apartment after she became an emancipated minor when she was 15.

==Career==
DiFranco started her own record company, Righteous Babe Records, in 1989 at age 19. She released her self-titled debut album in the winter of 1990, shortly after relocating to New York City. There, she took poetry classes at The New School, where she met poet Sekou Sundiata, who was to become a friend and mentor. She toured steadily for the next 15 years, pausing only to record albums. Appearances at Canadian folk festivals and increasingly larger venues in the U.S. reflected her increasing popularity on the North American folk and roots scene. Throughout the early and mid-1990s DiFranco toured solo and also as a duo with Canadian drummer Andy Stochansky.

In September 1995, DiFranco participated in a concert at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland Ohio, inaugurating the opening of the Woody Guthrie Archives in New York City. She later released a CD on Righteous Babe of the concert &quot;Til We Outnumber Em&quot; featuring artists such as DiFranco, Billy Bragg, Ramblin&#x27; Jack Elliott, Arlo Guthrie, Indigo Girls, Dave Pirner, Tim Robbins, and Bruce Springsteen with 100 percent of proceeds going to the Woody Guthrie Foundation and Archives and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum educational department.

In 1996, bassist Sara Lee joined the touring group, whose live rapport is showcased on the 1997 album &quot;Living in Clip&quot;. DiFranco would later release Lee&#x27;s solo album &quot;Make It Beautiful&quot; on Righteous Babe. In 1998, Stochansky left to pursue a solo career as a singer-songwriter. A new touring ensemble consisting of Jason Mercer on bass, Julie Wolf on keyboards, and Daren Hahn on drums, augmented at times by a horn section, accompanied DiFranco on tour between 1998 and 2002.

The 1990s were a period of heightened exposure for DiFranco, as she continued playing ever larger venues around the world and attracted international attention of the press, including cover stories in &quot;Spin&quot;, &quot;Ms.&quot;, and &quot;Magnet&quot;, among others, as well as appearances on MTV and VH1. Her playfully ironic cover of the Bacharach/David song &quot;Wishin&#x27; and Hopin&#x27;&quot; appeared under the opening titles of the film &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Wedding&quot;.
She guest starred on a 1998 episode of the Fox sitcom &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, as the voice of Peggy&#x27;s feminist guitar teacher, Emily.
Beginning in 1999, Righteous Babe Records began releasing albums by other artists including Sara Lee, Sekou Sundiata, Arto Lindsay, Bitch and Animal, That One Guy, Utah Phillips, Hamell on Trial, Andrew Bird, Kurt Swinghammer, Buddy Wakefield, Anaïs Mitchell and Nona Hendryx.

On September 11, 2001, DiFranco was in Manhattan and later penned the poem &quot;Self Evident&quot; about the experience. The poem was featured in the book &quot;It&#x27;s a Free Country: Personal Freedom in America After September 11&quot;. The poem&#x27;s title also became the name of DiFranco&#x27;s first book of poetry released exclusively in Italy by Minimum Fax. It was later also featured in &quot;Verses&quot;, a book of her poetry published in the U.S. by Seven Stories press. DiFranco has written and performed many spoken-word pieces throughout her career and was showcased as a poet on the HBO series &quot;Def Poetry&quot; in 2005.

Since her 2005 release &quot;Knuckle Down&quot; (co-produced by Joe Henry) DiFranco&#x27;s touring band and recordings have featured bass player Todd Sickafoose and in turns other musicians such as Allison Miller, Andy Borger, Herlin Riley, and Terence Higgins on drums and Mike Dillon on percussion and vibes.

On September 11, 2007, she released the first retrospective of her career, a two-disc compilation entitled &quot;Canon&quot; and simultaneously a retrospective collection of poetry book &quot;Verses&quot;. On September 30, 2008, she released &quot;Red Letter Year&quot;.
In 2009, DiFranco appeared at Pete Seeger&#x27;s 90th birthday celebration at Madison Square Garden, debuting her revamped version of the 1930s labor anthem &quot;Which Side Are You On?&quot; in a duet with Bruce Cockburn and also duetting with Kris Kristofferson on the folk classic &quot;There&#x27;s a Hole in the Bucket&quot;.

DiFranco released an album on January 17, 2012, &quot;¿Which Side Are You On?&quot;. It includes collaborations with Pete Seeger, Ivan Neville, Cyril Neville, Skerik, Adam Levy, Righteous Babe recording artist Anaïs Mitchell, CC Adcock, and a host of New Orleans–based horn players known for their work in such outfits as Galactic, Bonerama, and Rebirth Brass Band.

In 2014, she released her eighteenth album, &quot;Allergic to Water&quot;. In 2017, she released her nineteenth, &quot;Binary&quot;.

On May 7, 2019, DiFranco released a memoir, &quot;No Walls and the Recurring Dream&quot;, via Viking Books. It is described as a &quot;coming-of-age story&quot;.

In 2021, DiFranco released the album &quot;Revolutionary Love&quot; which was largely inspired by Valarie Kaur&#x27;s book &quot;See No Stranger.&quot;

DiFranco signed the October 2023 Artists4Ceasefire open letter to Joe Biden calling for a ceasefire during the Israeli bombardment of Gaza.

==Personal life==
DiFranco came out as bisexual in her twenties, and has written songs about love and sex with women and men. She addressed the controversy about her sexuality in the song &quot;In or Out&quot; on the album &quot;Imperfectly&quot; (1992). However, in 2015 she told the blog GoPride.com that she was &quot;not so queer anymore, but definitely a woman-centered woman and just a human rights-centered artist.&quot; In a 2019 interview with &quot;Jezebel&quot;, she stated that she preferred the term &quot;queer&quot; because &quot;bisexual&quot; &quot;always sounded very medical, like something you do to a frog in 9th grade science or something&quot;, and further added that &quot;the irony is I&#x27;m pretty fuckin&#x27; hetero, which is unfortunate for me because many of my deepest connections are with women. But, naw, I just like what&#x27;s in boys&#x27; pants better.&quot; In 1998, she married her sound engineer Andrew Gilchrist in a Unitarian Universalist service in Canada. DiFranco and Gilchrist divorced in 2003.

In 1990, she wrote &quot;Lost Woman Song&quot;, which was inspired by abortions she had at ages eighteen and twenty.

DiFranco&#x27;s father died in the summer of 2004. In July 2005, DiFranco developed tendinitis and took a nine-month hiatus from touring. In January 2007 DiFranco gave birth to her first child, a daughter, at her Buffalo home. She married the child&#x27;s father, Mike Napolitano, also her regular producer, in 2009. In an interview on September 13, 2012, DiFranco mentioned that she was pregnant with her second child. In April 2013, she gave birth to her second child, a son.

DiFranco has resided in the Bywater, New Orleans, neighborhood since 2008.

DiFranco has described herself as an atheist. On the subject of religion, DiFranco has stated:

DiFranco has spoken critically of cancel culture, saying it is &quot;just gonna get us nowhere&quot; and &quot;The human family can&#x27;t divorce each other&quot;. DiFranco herself has received criticism for planning a 2013 songwriting retreat at Nottoway, a former slave plantation. She cancelled the retreat three days after the news broke, writing on her website, &quot;I needed a wake-up call and you gave it to me.&quot; In a 2019 interview, she said of her choices at the time, &quot;I should have found the ultimate humility to put down my own hurt, and all of the misconceptions or mis-truths out there. You have to make yourself accountable. There&#x27;s a greater pain that&#x27;s bigger than me, and it&#x27;s more important.&quot;

DiFranco wrote in her memoir that she &quot;[sympathized] with both sides&quot; regarding the controversial trans-exclusionary policies of the Michigan Womyn&#x27;s Music Festival. In a 2019 interview, she elaborated on this statement, discussing her perception that cisgender women were being &quot;asked again ... to move over and make room for somebody else,&quot; and later expressed that she understood the difficulty &quot;for anybody outside of a very specific group to experience it the way that group does,&quot; saying that &quot;maybe [women&#x27;s spaces] should be a little more [inclusive]&quot;.

==Critical reception==
DiFranco has been a critical success for much of her career, with a career album average of 55 on Metacritic. &quot;Living in Clip&quot;, DiFranco&#x27;s 1998 double live album, is the only one to achieve gold record status to date. DiFranco was praised by &quot;The Buffalo News&quot; in 2006 as &quot;Buffalo&#x27;s leading lady of rock music&quot;.

Starting in 2003, DiFranco was nominated four consecutive times for Best Recording Package at the Grammy Awards, winning in 2004 for &quot;Evolve&quot;.

On July 21, 2006, DiFranco received the Woman of Courage Award at the National Organization for Women (NOW) Conference and Young Feminist Summit in Albany, New York. DiFranco was one of the first musicians to receive the award, given each year to a woman who has set herself apart by her contributions to the feminist movement.

In 2009, DiFranco received the Woody Guthrie Award for being a voice of positive social change.

==Music==
===Style===
DiFranco&#x27;s guitar playing is often characterized by a signature staccato style, rapid fingerpicking and many alternate tunings. She delivers many of her lines in a speaking style notable for its rhythmic variation. Her lyrics, which often include alliteration, metaphor, word play and a more or less gentle irony, have also received praise for their sophistication.
Although DiFranco&#x27;s music has been classified as both folk rock and alternative rock, she has reached across genres since her earliest albums incorporating first punk, then funk, hiphop, and jazz influences.

While primarily an acoustic guitarist she has used a variety of instruments and styles: brass instrumentation was prevalent in 1998&#x27;s &quot;Little Plastic Castle&quot;; a simple walking bass in her 1997 cover of Hal David and Burt Bacharach&#x27;s &quot;Wishin&#x27; and Hopin&#x27;; strings on the 1997 live album &quot;Living in Clip&quot; and 2004&#x27;s &quot;Knuckle Down&quot;; and electronics and synthesizers in 1999&#x27;s &quot;To the Teeth&quot; and 2006&#x27;s &quot;Reprieve&quot;.

DiFranco has stated that &quot;folk music is not an acoustic guitar – that&#x27;s not where the heart of it is. I use the word &#x27;folk&#x27; in reference to punk music and rap music. It&#x27;s an attitude, it&#x27;s an awareness of one&#x27;s heritage, and it&#x27;s a community. It&#x27;s subcorporate music that gives voice to different communities and their struggle against authority.&quot;

===Musical collaborations, cover versions, and samples===
DiFranco has collaborated with a wide range of artists. In 1997, she appeared on Canadian songwriter Bruce Cockburn&#x27;s &quot;Charity of Night&quot; album. In 1998, she produced fellow folksinger Dan Bern&#x27;s album &quot;Fifty Eggs&quot;.

She developed a deep association with folksinger and social activist Utah Phillips throughout the mid-1990s, sharing her stage and her audience with the older musician until his death in 2008 and resulting in two collaborative albums: &quot;The Past Didn&#x27;t Go Anywhere&quot; (1996) and &quot;Fellow Workers&quot; (1999, with liner notes by Howard Zinn). &quot;The Past&quot; is built around Phillips&#x27;s storytelling, an important part of his art that had not previously been documented on recordings; on the album, DiFranco provides musical settings for his speaking voice. The followup, &quot;Fellow Workers&quot;, was recorded live in Daniel Lanois&#x27;s Kingsway Studio in New Orleans and features Phillips fronting DiFranco&#x27;s touring band for a collection of songs and stories.

Prince recorded two songs with DiFranco in 1999, &quot;Providence&quot; on her &quot;To the Teeth&quot; album, and &quot;Eye Love U, But Eye Don&#x27;t Trust U Anymore&quot; on Prince&#x27;s &quot;Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic&quot; album. Funk and soul jazz musician Maceo Parker and rapper Corey Parker have both appeared on DiFranco&#x27;s albums and featured appearances by her on theirs. Parker and DiFranco toured together in 1999.

She has appeared on several compilations of the songs of Pete Seeger and frequented his Hudson Clearwater Revival Festival. In 2001, she appeared on Brazilian artist Lenine&#x27;s album &quot;Falange Canibal&quot;. In 2002, her rendition of Greg Brown&#x27;s &quot;The Poet Game&quot; appeared on &quot;Going Driftless: An Artist&#x27;s Tribute to Greg Brown&quot;. Also in 2002 she recorded a duet with Jackie Chan of the Irving Gordon song &quot;Unforgettable&quot; for a record of unlikely collaborations, &quot;When Pigs Fly: Songs You Never Thought You&#x27;d Hear&quot;.

In 2005, she appeared on Dar Williams&#x27; record &quot;My Better Self&quot;, duetting on William&#x27;s cover of Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;. She performed with Cyndi Lauper on &quot;Sisters of Avalon&quot; a track from Lauper&#x27;s 2005 &quot;The Body Acoustic&quot; album. In 2006, she produced Hamell on Trial&#x27;s album &quot;Songs for Parents Who Enjoy Drugs&quot;. In 2008, she appeared on Todd Sickafoose&#x27;s album &quot;Tiny Resisters&quot;. In 2010, she co-produced a track with Margaret Cho called &quot;Captain Cameltoe&quot; for the comedian&#x27;s &quot;Cho Dependant&quot; album. In 2011, she appeared on Rob Wasserman&#x27;s album &quot;Note of Hope&quot;, an exploration of the writings of Woody Guthrie with musical accompaniment, though the track in which she appeared, &quot;Voice&quot;, was actually recorded 13 years earlier. Also in 2011 she duetted with Greg Dulli on the Twilight Singers record &quot;Dynamite Steps&quot;.

Other artists have covered and sampled DiFranco&#x27;s work throughout the years. Her spoken word poem &quot;Self Evident&quot; was covered by Public Enemy founder Chuck D&#x27;s group called Impossebulls. Alana Davis had some commercial success with DiFranco&#x27;s song &quot;32 Flavors&quot;.

Samples from the track &quot;Coming Up&quot; were used by DJ Spooky in his album &quot;Live Without Dead Time&quot;, produced for AdBusters Magazine in 2003.

In 2010, DiFranco played Persephone on Anaïs Mitchell&#x27;s album Hadestown.

DiFranco was approached by Zoe Boekbinder to work on their &quot;Prison Music Project&quot;, an album of collaborations between incarcerated and formerly incarcerated writers and musicians on the outside. DiFranco co-produced the project with Boekbinder and co-wrote and performed &quot;Nowhere but Barstow and Prison.&quot; The album &quot;Long Time Gone&quot; was released on Righteous Babe Records in 2020 after ten years in the making.

===Lyrical content===
Although much of DiFranco&#x27;s material is autobiographical, it is often also strongly political. Many of her songs are concerned with contemporary social issues such as racism, sexism, sexual abuse, homophobia, reproductive rights, poverty, and war. In 2008, she donated a song to Aid Still Required&#x27;s CD to assist with the restoration of the devastation done to Southeast Asia from the 2004 tsunami.
The combination of personal and political is partially responsible for DiFranco&#x27;s early popularity among politically active college students, particularly those of the left wing, some of whom set up fan pages on the web to document DiFranco&#x27;s career as early as 1994. DiFranco&#x27;s rapid rise in popularity in the mid-1990s was fueled mostly by personal contact and word of mouth rather than mainstream media.

===Label independence===
DiFranco cites her anti-corporate ethos for the main reason she decided to start her own label. This has allowed her a considerable degree of creative freedom over the years, including, for example, providing all instrumentals and vocals and recording the album herself at her home on an analog 8-track reel to reel, and handling much of the artwork and packaging design for her 2004 album &quot;Educated Guess&quot;. She has referenced this independence from major labels in song more than once, including &quot;The Million You Never Made&quot; (&quot;Not a Pretty Girl&quot;), which discusses the act of turning down a lucrative contract, &quot;The Next Big Thing&quot; (&quot;Not So Soft&quot;), which describes an imagined meeting with a label head-hunter who evaluates the singer based on her looks, and &quot;Napoleon&quot; (&quot;Dilate&quot;), which sympathizes sarcastically with an unnamed friend who did sign with a label.

The business grew organically starting in 1990 with the first cassette tape. Connections were made when women in colleges started duplicating and sharing tapes. Offers to play at colleges started coming in and her popularity grew largely by word of mouth and through women&#x27;s groups or organizations. Zango and Goldenrod, two music distributors specializing in women&#x27;s music, started carrying DiFranco&#x27;s music. In general they sold music to independent music stores and women&#x27;s book stores. In 1995, Righteous Babe Records signed with Koch International for DiFranco&#x27;s release of &quot;Not a Pretty Girl&quot;. Her records could then be found in large and small record stores alike.

DiFranco has occasionally joined with Prince in discussing publicly the problems associated with major record companies. Righteous Babe Records employs a number of people in her hometown of Buffalo. In a 1997 open letter to &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine she expressed displeasure that what she considers a way to ensure her own artistic freedom was seen by others solely in terms of its financial success.

==Activism==
From the earliest days of her career, DiFranco has lent her voice and her name to a broad range of social movements, performing benefit concerts, appearing on benefit albums, speaking at rallies, and offering info table space to organizations at her concerts and the virtual equivalent on her website, among other methods and actions. In 1999, she created her own not-for-profit organization; as the Buffalo News has reported, &quot;Through the Righteous Babe Foundation, DiFranco has backed various grassroots cultural and political organizations, supporting causes ranging from abortion rights to gay visibility.&quot;

During the first Gulf War, DiFranco participated in the anti-war movement. In early 1993 she played Pete Seeger&#x27;s Clearwater Folk Festival for the first time. In 1998, she was a featured performer in the Dead Man Walking benefit concert series raising money for Sister Helen Prejean&#x27;s &quot;Not in Our Name&quot; anti-death penalty organization. DiFranco&#x27;s commitment to opposing the death penalty is longstanding; she has also been a long time supporter of the Southern Center for Human Rights.

During the 2000 U.S. presidential election, she actively supported and voted for Green Party candidate Ralph Nader, though in an open letter she made clear that if she lived in a swing state, she would vote for Al Gore to prevent George W. Bush from being elected.

In 2004, DiFranco visited Burma in order to learn about the Burmese resistance movement and the country&#x27;s fight for democracy. During her travels she met with then-detained resistance leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Her song &quot;In The Way&quot; was later featured on &quot;For the Lady&quot;, a benefit CD that donated all proceeds to the United States Campaign for Burma.

During the 2004 presidential primaries, she supported liberal, anti-war Democrat Dennis Kucinich, who appeared on stage with her during several of her concerts. After the primary season ended, and John Kerry was the clear Democratic candidate, DiFranco launched a &quot;Vote Dammit!&quot; tour of swing states encouraging audience members to vote. In 2005, she lobbied Congress against the proliferation of nuclear power in general and the placement of nuclear waste dumps on Indian land in particular. In 2008, she again backed Kucinich in his bid for the presidency.

In 2002, Righteous Babe Records established the &quot;Aiding Buffalo&#x27;s Children&quot; program in conjunction with members of the local community to raise funds for Buffalo&#x27;s public school system. To kick off the program, DiFranco donated &quot;a day&#x27;s pay&quot;—the performance fee from her concert that year at Shea&#x27;s Performing Arts Center— to ABC and challenged her fans to do the same. Aiding Buffalo&#x27;s Children has since been folded into the Community Foundation of Greater Buffalo, contributing to a variety of charitable funds.

In 2005, when Hurricane Katrina devastated DiFranco&#x27;s newly adopted home town of New Orleans, she collected donations from fans around the world through The Righteous Babe Store website for the Katrina Piano Fund, helping musicians replace instruments lost in the hurricane, raising over $47,500 for the cause.

In 2010, after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, she performed at the &quot;For Our Coast&quot; benefit concert joining Marianne Faithfull, C. C. Adcock and others at the Acadiana Center for the Arts Theater in Lafayette, raising money for Gulf Aid Acadiana, and the Gulf Aid show with Lenny Kravitz, Mos Def, and others at Mardi Gras World River City in New Orleans, both shows raising money to help protect the wetlands, clean up the coast and to assist the fishermen and their families affected by the spill.

DiFranco also sits on the board for The Roots of Music, founded by Rebirth Brass Band drummer Derrick Tabb. The organization provides free marching band instruction to children in the New Orleans area in addition to academic tutoring and mentoring.

DiFranco joined about 500,000 people at the March for Women&#x27;s Lives in DC in April 2004. As an honored guest she marched in the front row for the three-mile route, along with Margaret Cho, Janeane Garofalo, Whoopi Goldberg, Gloria Steinem and others. Later in the day, DiFranco played a few songs on the main stage in front of the Capitol, including &quot;Your Next Bold Move&quot;.

Scot Fisher, formerly Righteous Babe label president and DiFranco&#x27;s manager for many years, has been a longtime advocate of the preservation movement in Buffalo. In 1999, he and DiFranco purchased a decaying church on the verge of demolition in downtown Buffalo and began the lengthy process of restoring it. In 2006, the building opened its doors again, first briefly as &quot;The Church&quot; and then as &quot;Babeville,&quot; housing two concert venues, the record label&#x27;s business office, and Hallwalls Contemporary Arts Center.

DiFranco is also a member of the Toronto-based charity Artists Against Racism for which she participated in a radio PSA.

In October 2023, DiFranco signed an open letter to Joe Biden, President of the United States, of artists calling for a ceasefire of the Israeli bombardment of Gaza.

<doc id="2129" wikidata="Q670376" url="?curid=2129" title="Arizona Diamondbacks">
<text>The Arizona Diamondbacks are an American professional baseball team based in Phoenix, Arizona. The Diamondbacks compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) West Division. The franchise was established on March 9, 1995, and began play in 1998 as an expansion team. The team plays its home games at Chase Field. Along with the Tampa Bay Rays, the Diamondbacks are one of the newest teams in the MLB and are the youngest team to win a World Series.

After a fifth-place finish in their inaugural season, the Diamondbacks made several off-season acquisitions, including future Hall of Fame pitcher Randy Johnson, who won four consecutive Cy Young Awards in his first four seasons with the team. In 1999, Arizona won 100 games and their first division championship. In 2001, they won the World Series over the three-time defending champion New York Yankees, becoming the fastest expansion team in major league history to win the World Series and the first and only men&#x27;s major professional sports team in the State of Arizona to win a championship. 22 years later, they would return to the World Series, only to lose to the Texas Rangers in five games, thus earning the Diamondbacks their first World Series loss in team history.

From 1998 to 2024, the Diamondbacks had an overall record of ().

==History==

On March 9, 1995, Phoenix was awarded an expansion franchise to begin play for the season. A $130 million franchise fee was paid to Major League Baseball and on January 16, 1997, the Diamondbacks were voted into the National League. The Diamondbacks&#x27; first major league game was played against the Colorado Rockies on March 31, 1998, at Bank One Ballpark. The ballpark was renamed Chase Field in 2005, as a result of Bank One Corporation&#x27;s merger with JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

Since their debut, the Diamondbacks have won two Wild Card Series, five NL West division titles, two NL pennants, and the 2001 World Series.

They later became the fastest expansion franchise in baseball history to win a World Series. The Diamondbacks defeated the Yankees in Game 7 during the 2001 postseason. 

After beating the Philadelphia Phillies 4–2 in Game 7 of the 2023 NLCS at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, the Arizona Diamondbacks returned to the World Series for the first time since 2001 – against the Texas Rangers on October 27, 2023.
They lost the series 4–1 at home in Arizona on November 1, 2023.

==Logos and uniforms==

===1998–2006===

The Diamondbacks&#x27; original colors were purple, black, teal and copper. Their logo was an italicized block letter &quot;A&quot; with a diamond pattern, with the crossbar represented by a snake&#x27;s tongue. This period saw the Diamondbacks wear several uniform combinations.

At home, the Diamondbacks wore cream uniforms with purple pinstripes. The primary sleeved uniform, worn from 1998 to 2000, featured the full team name (&quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Backs&quot; stacked together) in front and chest numbers. The alternate sleeveless version contained the &quot;A&quot; logo on the right chest, and was paired with purple undershirts. Before the 2001 season, the sleeved uniform was changed to feature the &quot;A&quot; logo. In all three uniforms, player names were teal with purple trim, and numbers were purple with white with teal trim.

The Diamondbacks&#x27; primary road gray uniform also had purple pinstripes. The first version featured &quot;Arizona&quot; in purple with white and teal trim along with black drop shadows, with chest numbers added. Player names were in purple with white trim, and numbers were teal with white and purple trim. In 2001, the uniform became sleeveless with black undershirts, and the lettering scheme was changed to purple with white, copper and black accents.

The alternate home purple uniform featured &quot;Arizona&quot; in teal with white and copper trim and black drop shadows. The letters were rendered in teal with copper and white trim, but were changed to copper with teal and white trim after only one season. This set was worn until 2002.

The alternate road black uniform featured the &quot;A&quot; logo on the right chest, while letters were purple with white trim and numbers were teal with white and purple trim. A zigzag pattern of teal, copper and purple was featured on the sleeves. In 2001, the uniform was changed to feature &quot;Arizona&quot; in front. The letters became purple with white and copper trim.

The Diamondbacks initially wore four different cap versions. The primary home cap is all-purple, while the road cap is black with a teal brim. They also wore a cream cap with purple brim, and a teal cap with purple brim. All designs featured the primary &quot;A&quot; logo. In 1999, the road cap became all-black and contained the alternate &quot;D-snake&quot; logo rendered in copper. Also, the teal and cream alternate caps were dropped.

The left sleeve of all four uniforms contained the snake logo with the full team name until the 2004 season, when it became exclusive to the road black uniform.

===2007–2015===
The franchise unveiled new uniforms and colors of Sedona red, Sonoran sand and black on November 8, 2006. The red shade is named for the sandstone canyon at Red Rock State Park near Sedona, while the beige (sand) shade is named for the Sonoran Desert. A sleeve patch was added featuring a lowercase &quot;d&quot; and &quot;b&quot; configured to look like a snake&#x27;s head. The team also kept the &quot;D&quot; logo, which was slightly altered and put on an all-red cap to be used as their game cap. They kept the &quot;A&quot; logo with the new colors applied to it, with a solid black cap used as the alternate cap. Arizona&#x27;s updated color scheme bore a striking resemblance to the Houston Astros&#x27; color scheme (brick red, sand and black) that the Astros used until 2012, as well as the NHL&#x27;s Phoenix Coyotes, whose adoption of those colors predated the Diamondbacks by four years.

The white home uniform featured &quot;D-Backs&quot; in red with sand and black trim. The road gray uniform featured &quot;Arizona&quot; in red with sand and black trim. Player names were red with black trim while numbers were black with red trim.

The alternate red uniform contained &quot;D-Backs&quot; in sand with red and black trim, with player names in sand with black trim and numbers in black with sand trim.

There were two versions of the alternate black uniform. One design has the alternate &quot;A&quot; logo on the right chest, while the other has &quot;Arizona&quot; written in red with black and sand trim. The latter was introduced in 2013 as a tribute to the victims of the Yarnell Hill Fire. On both uniforms, player names were sand with red trim, and numbers in red with sand trim.

===2016–2023===

Before the 2016 season, the Diamondbacks reincorporated teal into its color scheme while keeping Sedona Red, Sonoran Sand and black. They also unveiled eight different uniform combinations, including two separate home white and away grey uniforms. One major difference between the two sets is that the non-teal uniforms feature a snakeskin pattern on the shoulders, while the teal-trimmed uniforms include a charcoal/grey snakeskin pattern on the back. Arizona also kept the throwback pinstriped sleeveless uniforms from their 2001 championship season for use during Thursday home games.

Starting with the 2020 season, the Diamondbacks made slight redesigns to their uniforms. The snakeskin patterns were removed while the teal-trimmed grey uniforms were retired. The team also reverted to a standard grey uniform after wearing a darker shade on the previous set. Two home white uniforms remain in use: the primary Sedona Red and the alternate teal. They would also wear two black uniforms: one with the primary &quot;A&quot; logo on the left chest and the other with &quot;Los D-Backs&quot; trimmed in teal. Three cap designs were also unveiled, all with a black base: the primary &quot;A&quot; cap, the teal-trimmed &quot;snake&quot; cap (paired exclusively on the teal alternates), and the sand-trimmed &quot;snake&quot; cap with red brim (paired exclusively on the Sedona Red alternates). The Nike swoosh logo is also placed on the right chest near the shoulder. In 2022, the Diamondbacks introduced a red &quot;A&quot; cap with black brim.

In 2021, the Diamondbacks were one of seven teams to wear Nike &quot;City Connect&quot; uniforms. The design is primarily sand and has &quot;Serpientes&quot; in black script lettering emblazoned in front. The first &quot;S&quot; in &quot;Serpientes&quot; was shaped to resemble a rattlesnake. The right sleeve has the flag of Arizona patch recolored to the Diamondbacks&#x27; red, sand and black scheme, and the left sleeve has the &quot;A&quot; logo recolored to black and sand. Numerals are in red. The cap is primarily sand with black brim and has the &quot;A&quot; logo in black and sand; the regular batting helmet is used with the uniform. Initially, the Diamondbacks wore white pants with this uniform, but has since switched to sand pants.

Before the 2023 season, the Diamondbacks promoted the alternate white uniform with teal accents to its primary home uniform and retired the previous Sedona Red white uniform. This is due to a new Nike rule that limits teams to four regular uniforms plus the &quot;City Connect&quot; uniform.

===Since 2024===
Coming off their second World Series appearance in , the Diamondbacks unveiled refreshed uniform designs starting in 2024. Turquoise returned full-time as an accent color on all uniforms along with Sedona red and black, but sand was removed except on the &quot;City Connect&quot; uniform. The home uniform is now a cream base with black piping, featuring the &quot;A&quot; logo on the left chest. The road grey uniform with black piping featured &quot;Arizona&quot; in Sedona red with teal and black outlines. The alternate black uniform with teal piping shared the same features as the home uniform. The alternate Sedona red uniform incorporated the full &quot;Diamondbacks&quot; wordmark in black with teal and Sedona red outlines, along with teal numbers trimmed in black on the left chest. All uniforms featured the snake head alternate logo on either sleeve, with the sponsor logo (Avnet since 2023) on the other sleeve. The home cap is Sedona red with black brim and featured the &quot;A&quot; logo, and its all-black counterpart is worn with both the home and black alternate uniform. The road cap is black with Sedona red trim and featured the return of the &quot;D-snake&quot; logo and is worn with both the road and alternate Sedona red uniform. The all-Sedona red alternate cap shared the same features as the road cap and is worn with the Sedona red uniform.

==Regular season home attendance==

==Radio and television==
On July 18, 2023, a federal bankruptcy court granted Bally Sports&#x27; parent company Diamond Sports Group a motion to decline its contract with the Diamondbacks as part of its chapter 11 bankruptcy. As a result, Major League Baseball&#x27;s local media division assumed production of the Diamondbacks&#x27; regional telecasts (maintaining staff such as commentators) and distributed them via local television providers and MLB.tv. As of 2024, these games are branded as DBacks.TV. Games air on the following cable providers and networks:

*Cox (Phoenix) (CH. 34)
*Cox (Tucson) (CH. 26)
*Cox (Las Vegas) (YurView Las Vegas)
*DirecTV/DirecTV Stream (CH. 686)
*Charter (CH. 304 or CH. 444)
*Xfinity/Comcast (CH. 1261)
*FuboTV

The primary television play-by-play voice for the team&#x27;s first nine seasons of play was Thom Brennaman, who also broadcast baseball and college football games nationally for Fox Television. Brennaman was the TV announcer for the Chicago Cubs and Cincinnati Reds (along with his father Marty Brennaman) before being hired by Diamondbacks founder Jerry Colangelo in 1996, two years before the team would begin play.

In October 2006, Brennaman left the Diamondbacks to call games with his father for the Reds beginning in 2007, signing a four-year deal.

On November 1, 2006, the team announced that the TV voice of the Milwaukee Brewers since 2002, Daron Sutton, would be hired as the Diamondbacks primary TV play-by-play voice. Sutton was signed to a five-year contract with a team option for three more years. Sutton&#x27;s signature chants included &quot;let&#x27;s get some runs&quot; when the D-backs trail in late innings.

Former Diamondbacks and Chicago Cubs first baseman Mark Grace and knuckleballer Tom Candiotti were the Diamondbacks primary color analysts for the 2006 and 2007 seasons. Former Diamondbacks third baseman Matt Williams also did color commentary on occasion, as did Cardinals and NBC broadcast legend Joe Garagiola, a longtime Phoenix-area resident and father of Joe Garagiola Jr., the first GM of the Diamondbacks.

The Diamondbacks announced in July 2007 that for the 2008 season, all regionally broadcast Diamondbacks TV games would be shown exclusively on Fox Sports Arizona (now Bally Sports Arizona) and a few could possibly be shown on the national &quot;MLB on Fox&quot; telecasts. Bally Sports Arizona is seen in 2.8 million households in Arizona and New Mexico. The previous flagship station since the inaugural 1998 season was KTVK (Channel 3), a popular over-the-air independent station (and former longtime ABC affiliate) in Phoenix.

From 2009 to 2012, Grace and Sutton were tagged as the main broadcasters of the Diamondbacks with pre-game and postgame shows on Fox Sports Arizona, being hosted by Joe Borowski.

On June 21, 2012, Sutton was suspended indefinitely amid rumors of insubordination. On August 24, the team announced that Grace had requested an indefinite leave of absence after being arrested for his second DUI in less than two years. Grace was later indicted on four DUI counts.) For the remainder of the 2012 season, Sutton was replaced by Greg Schulte (Jeff Munn replaced Schulte on the radio broadcast) and Grace was replaced by Luis Gonzalez. At the end of the 2012 season, the team announced that neither Sutton nor Grace would return for the 2013 season.

On October 18, 2012, the team announced that Bob Brenly would return as a broadcaster to replace Grace and that he would be joined by then-ESPN personality Steve Berthiaume.

The English language flagship radio station is KTAR. Greg Schulte was the regular radio play-by-play voice, a 25-year veteran of sports radio in the Phoenix market, also well known for his previous work on Phoenix Suns, Arizona Cardinals and Arizona State University (ASU) broadcasts. It was announced in February 2023 that he would be retiring after the 2023 MLB season. He would call games with analyst Tom Candiotti.

Jeff Munn served as a backup radio play-by-play announcer until 2016; he served as the regular public address announcer at Chase Field in the early days of the franchise. He previously served as the public address announcer for the Suns in the 1990s at what became Footprint Center. He is also the play-by-play radio voice for ASU women&#x27;s basketball. Mike Ferrin served in the same role for six years before parting ways with the team, and he was replaced by Chris Garagiola in December 2021.

===Spanish broadcasts===
The flagship Spanish language radio station is KHOV-FM 105.1 with Oscar Soria, Rodrigo López, and Richard Saenz.

Games were televised in Spanish on KPHE-LP—with Oscar Soria and Jerry Romo as the announcers, but this arrangement ended prior to the 2009 season due to the team switching fully to Fox Sports Arizona and the lack of carriage of KPHE-LP on the Cox cable system.

===Season record===
==Roster==
==Rivalry with the Los Angeles Dodgers==
The rivalry between the Diamondbacks and the Los Angeles Dodgers has been one of the fiercest divisional matchups for several years. Animosity between the two teams began to escalate during the 2010s in multiple incidents involving either team throwing pitches at one another or instigating into large-scale brawls between both benches. After eliminating the Diamondbacks and clinching the division on September 19, 2013, multiple Dodgers players celebrated the win by jumping into the pool at Chase Field. The two sides met during the 2017 National League Division Series as the Diamondbacks were swept 3–0 by the Dodgers en route to their appearance in the World Series that season. The Dodgers led the series 257–191 with a 3–0 lead in the postseason. After clinching the 2023 NL Wild Card berth and defeating the Milwaukee Brewers in the National League Wild Card Series, the Diamondbacks played the Dodgers again in the 2023 NLDS. There, the Diamondbacks emphatically swept the Dodgers to even the all-time postseason record between the two clubs at 3–3.

<text>Aesthetics (also spelled esthetics) is the branch of philosophy concerned with the nature of beauty and the nature of taste and, in a broad sense, incorporates the philosophy of art. Aesthetics examines the philosophy of aesthetic value, which is determined by critical judgments of artistic taste; thus, the function of aesthetics is the &quot;critical reflection on art, culture and nature&quot;.

Aesthetics studies natural and artificial sources of experiences and how people form a judgment about those sources of experience. It considers what happens in our minds when we engage with objects or environments such as viewing visual art, listening to music, reading poetry, experiencing a play, watching a fashion show, movie, sports or exploring various aspects of nature.

The philosophy of art specifically studies how artists imagine, create, and perform works of art, as well as how people use, enjoy, and criticize art. Aesthetics considers why people like some works of art and not others, as well as how art can affect our moods and our beliefs. Both aesthetics and the philosophy of art try to find answers to what exactly is art and what makes good art.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;aesthetic&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek (&#x27;, &quot;perceptive, sensitive, pertaining to sensory perception&quot;), which in turn comes from (&#x27;, &quot;I perceive, sense, learn&quot;) and is related to (&quot;&quot;, &quot;perception, sensation&quot;). Aesthetics in this central sense has been said to start with the series of articles on &quot;The Pleasures of the Imagination&quot;, which the journalist Joseph Addison wrote in the early issues of the magazine &quot;The Spectator&quot; in 1712.

The term &quot;aesthetics&quot; was appropriated and coined with new meaning by the German philosopher Alexander Baumgarten in his dissertation &quot;Meditationes philosophicae de nonnullis ad poema pertinentibus&quot; () in 1735; Baumgarten chose &quot;aesthetics&quot; because he wished to emphasize the experience of art as a means of knowing. Baumgarten&#x27;s definition of aesthetics in the fragment &quot;Aesthetica&quot; (1750) is occasionally considered the first definition of modern aesthetics.

The term was introduced into the English language by Thomas Carlyle in his &quot;Life of Friedrich Schiller&quot; (1825).

==History of aesthetics==

The history of the philosophy of art as aesthetics covering the visual arts, the literary arts, the musical arts and other artists forms of expression can be dated back at least to Aristotle and the ancient Greeks. Aristotle writing of the literary arts in his &quot;Poetics&quot; stated that epic poetry, tragedy, comedy, dithyrambic poetry, painting, sculpture, music, and dance are all fundamentally acts of mimesis, each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner. Aristotle applies the term &quot;mimesis&quot; both as a property of a work of art and also as the product of the artist&#x27;s intention and contends that the audience&#x27;s realisation of the &quot;mimesis&quot; is vital to understanding the work itself.

Aristotle states that &quot;mimesis&quot; is a natural instinct of humanity that separates humans from animals and that all human artistry &quot;follows the pattern of nature&quot;. Because of this, Aristotle believed that each of the mimetic arts possesses what Stephen Halliwell calls &quot;highly structured procedures for the achievement of their purposes.&quot; For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language.

The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation – through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama. Erich Auerbach has extended the discussion of history of aesthetics in his book titled &quot;Mimesis&quot;.

==Aesthetics and the philosophy of art==

Some writers distinguish aesthetics from the philosophy of art, claiming that the former is the study of beauty and taste while the latter is the study of works of art. Slater holds that the &quot;full field&quot; of aesthetics is broad, but in a narrow sense it can be limited to the theory of beauty, excluding the philosophy of art. Aesthetics typically considers questions of beauty as well as of art. It examines topics such as art works, aesthetic experience, and aesthetic judgment.

Aesthetic experience refers to the sensory contemplation or appreciation of an object (not necessarily a work of art), while artistic judgment refers to the recognition, appreciation or criticism of art in general or a specific work of art. In the words of one philosopher, &quot;Philosophy of art is about art. Aesthetics is about many things—including art. But it is also about our experience of breathtaking landscapes or the pattern of shadows on the wall opposite your office.

Philosophers of art weigh a culturally contingent conception of art versus one that is purely theoretical. They study the varieties of art in relation to their physical, social, and cultural environments. Aesthetic philosophers sometimes also refer to psychological studies to help understand how people see, hear, imagine, think, learn, and act in relation to the materials and problems of art. Aesthetic psychology studies the creative process and the aesthetic experience.

==Aesthetic judgment, universals, and ethics==
===Aesthetic judgment===
Aesthetics examines affective domain response to an object or phenomenon. Judgements of aesthetic value rely on the ability to discriminate at a sensory level. However, aesthetic judgments usually go beyond sensory discrimination.

For David Hume, delicacy of taste is not merely &quot;the ability to detect all the ingredients in a composition&quot;, but also the sensitivity &quot;to pains as well as pleasures, which escape the rest of mankind.&quot; Thus, sensory discrimination is linked to capacity for pleasure.

For Immanuel Kant (&quot;Critique of Judgment&quot;, 1790), &quot;enjoyment&quot; is the result when pleasure arises from sensation, but judging something to be &quot;beautiful&quot; has a third requirement: sensation must give rise to pleasure by engaging reflective contemplation. Judgements of beauty are sensory, emotional and intellectual all at once. Kant observed of a man &quot;if he says that &#x27;Canary wine is pleasant,&#x27; he is quite content if someone else corrects his expression and remind him that he ought to say instead: &#x27;It is pleasant &quot;to me&quot;,&#x27;&quot; because &quot;every one has his own [sense of] taste&quot;. The case of &quot;beauty&quot; is different from mere &quot;pleasantness&quot; because &quot;if he gives out anything as beautiful, he supposes in others the same satisfaction—he judges not merely for himself, but for every one, and speaks of beauty as if it were a property of things.&quot;

Viewer interpretations of beauty may on occasion be observed to possess two concepts of value: aesthetics and taste. Aesthetics is the philosophical notion of beauty. Taste is a result of an education process and awareness of elite cultural values learned through exposure to mass culture. Bourdieu examined how the elite in society define the aesthetic values like taste and how varying levels of exposure to these values can result in variations by class, cultural background, and education. According to Kant, beauty is subjective and universal; thus certain things are beautiful to everyone. In the opinion of Władysław Tatarkiewicz, there are six conditions for the presentation of art: beauty, form, representation, reproduction of reality, artistic expression and innovation. However, one may not be able to pin down these qualities in a work of art.

The question of whether there are facts about aesthetic judgments belongs to the branch of metaphilosophy known as meta-aesthetics.

====Factors involved in aesthetic judgment====
Aesthetic judgment is closely tied to disgust. Responses like disgust show that sensory detection is linked in instinctual ways to facial expressions including physiological responses like the gag reflex. Disgust is triggered largely by dissonance; as Darwin pointed out, seeing a stripe of soup in a man&#x27;s beard is disgusting even though neither soup nor beards are themselves disgusting. Aesthetic judgments may be linked to emotions or, like emotions, partially embodied in physical reactions. For example, the awe inspired by a sublime landscape might physically manifest with an increased heart-rate or pupil dilation.

As seen, emotions are conformed to &#x27;cultural&#x27; reactions, therefore aesthetics is always characterized by &#x27;regional responses&#x27;, as Francis Grose was the first to affirm in his &quot;Rules for Drawing Caricaturas: With an Essay on Comic Painting&quot; (1788), published in W. Hogarth, The Analysis of Beauty, Bagster, London s.d. (1791? [1753]), pp. 1–24. Francis Grose can therefore be claimed to be the first critical &#x27;aesthetic regionalist&#x27; in proclaiming the anti-universality of aesthetics in contrast to the perilous and always resurgent dictatorship of beauty. &#x27;Aesthetic Regionalism&#x27; can thus be seen as a political statement and stance which vies against any universal notion of beauty to safeguard the counter-tradition of aesthetics related to what has been considered and dubbed un-beautiful just because one&#x27;s culture does not contemplate it, e.g. Edmund Burke&#x27;s sublime, what is usually defined as &#x27;primitive&#x27; art, or un-harmonious, non-cathartic art, camp art, which &#x27;beauty&#x27; posits and creates, dichotomously, as its opposite, without even the need of formal statements, but which will be &#x27;perceived&#x27; as ugly.

Likewise, aesthetic judgments may be culturally conditioned to some extent. Victorians in Britain often saw African sculpture as ugly, but just a few decades later, Edwardian audiences saw the same sculptures as beautiful. Evaluations of beauty may well be linked to desirability, perhaps even to sexual desirability. Thus, judgments of aesthetic value can become linked to judgments of economic, political, or moral value. In a current context, a Lamborghini might be judged to be beautiful partly because it is desirable as a status symbol, or it may be judged to be repulsive partly because it signifies over-consumption and offends political or moral values.

The context of its presentation also affects the perception of artwork; artworks presented in a classical museum context are liked more and rated more interesting than when presented in a sterile laboratory context. While specific results depend heavily on the style of the presented artwork, overall, the effect of context proved to be more important for the perception of artwork than the effect of genuineness (whether the artwork was being presented as original or as a facsimile/copy).

Aesthetic judgments can often be very fine-grained and internally contradictory. Likewise aesthetic judgments seem often to be at least partly intellectual and interpretative. What a thing means or symbolizes is often what is being judged. Modern aestheticians have asserted that will and desire were almost dormant in aesthetic experience, yet preference and choice have seemed important aesthetics to some 20th-century thinkers. The point is already made by Hume, but see Mary Mothersill, &quot;Beauty and the Critic&#x27;s Judgment&quot;, in &quot;The Blackwell Guide to Aesthetics&quot;, 2004. Thus aesthetic judgments might be seen to be based on the senses, emotions, intellectual opinions, will, desires, culture, preferences, values, subconscious behaviour, conscious decision, training, instinct, sociological institutions, or some complex combination of these, depending on exactly which theory is employed.

A third major topic in the study of aesthetic judgments is how they are unified across art forms. For instance, the source of a painting&#x27;s beauty has a different character to that of beautiful music, suggesting their aesthetics differ in kind. The distinct inability of language to express aesthetic judgment and the role of social construction further cloud this issue.

===Aesthetic universals===
The philosopher Denis Dutton identified six universal signatures in human aesthetics:

# Expertise or virtuosity. Humans cultivate, recognize, and admire technical artistic skills.
# Nonutilitarian pleasure. People enjoy art for art&#x27;s sake, and do not demand that it keep them warm or put food on the table.
# Style. Artistic objects and performances satisfy rules of composition that place them in a recognizable style.
# Criticism. People make a point of judging, appreciating, and interpreting works of art.
# Imitation. With a few important exceptions like abstract painting, works of art simulate experiences of the world.
# Special focus. Art is set aside from ordinary life and made a dramatic focus of experience.

Artists such as Thomas Hirschhorn have indicated that there are too many exceptions to Dutton&#x27;s categories. For example, Hirschhorn&#x27;s installations deliberately eschew technical virtuosity. People can appreciate a Renaissance Madonna for aesthetic reasons, but such objects often had (and sometimes still have) specific devotional functions. &quot;Rules of composition&quot; that might be read into Duchamp&#x27;s &quot;Fountain&quot; or John Cage&#x27;s &quot;4′33″&quot; do not locate the works in a recognizable style (or certainly not a style recognizable at the time of the works&#x27; realization). Moreover, some of Dutton&#x27;s categories seem too broad: a physicist might entertain hypothetical worlds in his/her imagination in the course of formulating a theory. Another problem is that Dutton&#x27;s categories seek to universalize traditional European notions of aesthetics and art forgetting that, as André Malraux and others have pointed out, there have been large numbers of cultures in which such ideas (including the idea &quot;art&quot; itself) were non-existent.

===Aesthetic ethics===
Aesthetic ethics refers to the idea that human conduct and behaviour ought to be governed by that which is beautiful and attractive. John Dewey has pointed out that the unity of aesthetics and ethics is in fact reflected in our understanding of behaviour being &quot;fair&quot;—the word having a double meaning of attractive and morally acceptable. More recently, James Page has suggested that aesthetic ethics might be taken to form a philosophical rationale for peace education.

== Beauty ==

Beauty is one of the main subjects of aesthetics, together with art and taste. Many of its definitions include the idea that an object is beautiful if perceiving it is accompanied by aesthetic pleasure. Among the examples of beautiful objects are landscapes, sunsets, humans and works of art. Beauty is a positive aesthetic value that contrasts with ugliness as its negative counterpart.

Different intuitions commonly associated with beauty and its nature are in conflict with each other, which poses certain difficulties for understanding it. On the one hand, beauty is ascribed to things as an objective, public feature. On the other hand, it seems to depend on the subjective, emotional response of the observer. It is said, for example, that &quot;beauty is in the eye of the beholder&quot;. It may be possible to reconcile these intuitions by affirming that it depends both on the objective features of the beautiful thing and the subjective response of the observer. One way to achieve this is to hold that an object is beautiful if it has the power to bring about certain aesthetic experiences in the perceiving subject. This is often combined with the view that the subject needs to have the ability to correctly perceive and judge beauty, sometimes referred to as &quot;sense of taste&quot;. Various conceptions of how to define and understand beauty have been suggested. &quot;Classical conceptions&quot; emphasize the objective side of beauty by defining it in terms of the relation between the beautiful object as a whole and its parts: the parts should stand in the right proportion to each other and thus compose an integrated harmonious whole. &quot;Hedonist conceptions&quot;, on the other hand, focus more on the subjective side by drawing a necessary connection between pleasure and beauty, e.g. that for an object to be beautiful is for it to cause disinterested pleasure. Other conceptions include defining beautiful objects in terms of their value, of a loving attitude towards them or of their function.

==New Criticism and &quot;The Intentional Fallacy&quot;==
During the first half of the twentieth century, a significant shift to general aesthetic theory took place which attempted to apply aesthetic theory between various forms of art, including the literary arts and the visual arts, to each other. This resulted in the rise of the New Criticism school and debate concerning &quot;the intentional fallacy&quot;. At issue was the question of whether the aesthetic intentions of the artist in creating the work of art, whatever its specific form, should be associated with the criticism and evaluation of the final product of the work of art, or, if the work of art should be evaluated on its own merits independent of the intentions of the artist.

In 1946, William K. Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley published a classic and controversial New Critical essay entitled &quot;The Intentional Fallacy&quot;, in which they argued strongly against the relevance of an author&#x27;s intention, or &quot;intended meaning&quot; in the analysis of a literary work. For Wimsatt and Beardsley, the words on the page were all that mattered; importation of meanings from outside the text was considered irrelevant, and potentially distracting.

In another essay, &quot;The Affective Fallacy,&quot; which served as a kind of sister essay to &quot;The Intentional Fallacy&quot;, Wimsatt and Beardsley also discounted the reader&#x27;s personal/emotional reaction to a literary work as a valid means of analyzing a text. This fallacy would later be repudiated by theorists from the reader-response school of literary theory. One of the leading theorists from this school, Stanley Fish, was himself trained by New Critics. Fish criticizes Wimsatt and Beardsley in his essay &quot;Literature in the Reader&quot; (1970).

As summarized by Berys Gaut and Livingston in their essay &quot;The Creation of Art&quot;: &quot;Structuralist and post-structuralists theorists and critics were sharply critical of many aspects of New Criticism, beginning with the emphasis on aesthetic appreciation and the so-called autonomy of art, but they reiterated the attack on biographical criticisms&#x27; assumption that the artist&#x27;s activities and experience were a privileged critical topic.&quot; These authors contend that: &quot;Anti-intentionalists, such as formalists, hold that the intentions involved in the making of art are irrelevant or peripheral to correctly interpreting art. So details of the act of creating a work, though possibly of interest in themselves, have no bearing on the correct interpretation of the work.&quot;

Gaut and Livingston define the intentionalists as distinct from formalists stating that: &quot;Intentionalists, unlike formalists, hold that reference to intentions is essential in fixing the correct interpretation of works.&quot; They quote Richard Wollheim as stating that, &quot;The task of criticism is the reconstruction of the creative process, where the creative process must in turn be thought of as something not stopping short of, but terminating on, the work of art itself.&quot;

==Derivative forms of aesthetics==
A large number of derivative forms of aesthetics have developed as contemporary and transitory forms of inquiry associated with the field of aesthetics which include the post-modern, psychoanalytic, scientific, and mathematical among others.

===Post-modern aesthetics and psychoanalysis===
Early-twentieth-century artists, poets and composers challenged existing notions of beauty, broadening the scope of art and aesthetics. In 1941, Eli Siegel, American philosopher and poet, founded Aesthetic Realism, the philosophy that reality itself is aesthetic, and that &quot;The world, art, and self explain each other: each is the aesthetic oneness of opposites.&quot;

Various attempts have been made to define Post-Modern Aesthetics. The challenge to the assumption that beauty was central to art and aesthetics, thought to be original, is actually continuous with older aesthetic theory; Aristotle was the first in the Western tradition to classify &quot;beauty&quot; into types as in his theory of drama, and Kant made a distinction between beauty and the sublime. What was new was a refusal to credit the higher status of certain types, where the taxonomy implied a preference for tragedy and the sublime to comedy and the Rococo.

Croce suggested that &quot;expression&quot; is central in the way that beauty was once thought to be central. George Dickie suggested that the sociological institutions of the art world were the glue binding art and sensibility into unities. Marshall McLuhan suggested that art always functions as a &quot;counter-environment&quot; designed to make visible what is usually invisible about a society. Theodor Adorno felt that aesthetics could not proceed without confronting the role of the culture industry in the commodification of art and aesthetic experience. Hal Foster attempted to portray the reaction against beauty and Modernist art in &quot;The Anti-Aesthetic: Essays on Postmodern Culture&quot;. Arthur Danto has described this reaction as &quot;kalliphobia&quot; (after the Greek word for beauty, κάλλος &quot;kallos&quot;). André Malraux explains that the notion of beauty was connected to a particular conception of art that arose with the Renaissance and was still dominant in the eighteenth century (but was supplanted later). The discipline of aesthetics, which originated in the eighteenth century, mistook this transient state of affairs for a revelation of the permanent nature of art. Brian Massumi suggests to reconsider beauty following the aesthetical thought in the philosophy of Deleuze and Guattari. Walter Benjamin echoed Malraux in believing aesthetics was a comparatively recent invention, a view proven wrong in the late 1970s, when Abraham Moles and Frieder Nake analyzed links between beauty, information processing, and information theory. Denis Dutton in &quot;The Art Instinct&quot; also proposed that an aesthetic sense was a vital evolutionary factor.

Jean-François Lyotard re-invokes the Kantian distinction between taste and the sublime. Sublime painting, unlike kitsch realism, &quot;... will enable us to see only by making it impossible to see; it will please only by causing pain.&quot;

Sigmund Freud inaugurated aesthetical thinking in Psychoanalysis mainly via the &quot;Uncanny&quot; as aesthetical affect. Following Freud and Merleau-Ponty, Jacques Lacan theorized aesthetics in terms of sublimation and the Thing.

The relation of Marxist aesthetics to post-modern aesthetics is still a contentious area of debate.

===Aesthetics and science===
The field of experimental aesthetics was founded by Gustav Theodor Fechner in the 19th century. Experimental aesthetics in these times had been characterized by a subject-based, inductive approach. The analysis of individual experience and behaviour based on experimental methods is a central part of experimental aesthetics. In particular, the perception of works of art, music, sound, or modern items such as websites or other IT products is studied. Experimental aesthetics is strongly oriented towards the natural sciences. Modern approaches mostly come from the fields of cognitive psychology (aesthetic cognitivism) or neuroscience (neuroaesthetics).

===Truth in beauty and mathematics===
Mathematical considerations, such as symmetry and complexity, are used for analysis in theoretical aesthetics. This is different from the aesthetic considerations of applied aesthetics used in the study of mathematical beauty. Aesthetic considerations such as symmetry and simplicity are used in areas of philosophy, such as ethics and theoretical physics and cosmology to define truth, outside of empirical considerations. Beauty and Truth have been argued to be nearly synonymous, as reflected in the statement &quot;Beauty is truth, truth beauty&quot; in the poem &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot; by John Keats, or by the Hindu motto &quot;Satyam Shivam Sundaram&quot; (Satya (Truth) is Shiva (God), and Shiva is Sundaram (Beautiful)). The fact that judgments of beauty and judgments of truth both are influenced by processing fluency, which is the ease with which information can be processed, has been presented as an explanation for why beauty is sometimes equated with truth. Recent research found that people use beauty as an indication for truth in mathematical pattern tasks. However, scientists including the mathematician David Orrell and physicist Marcelo Gleiser have argued that the emphasis on aesthetic criteria such as symmetry is equally capable of leading scientists astray.

===Computational approaches===

Computational approaches to aesthetics emerged amid efforts to use computer science methods &quot;to predict, convey, and evoke emotional response to a piece of art. In this field, aesthetics is not considered to be dependent on taste but is a matter of cognition, and, consequently, learning. In 1928, the mathematician George David Birkhoff created an aesthetic measure formula_1 as the ratio of order to complexity.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Max Bense, Abraham Moles and Frieder Nake were among the first to analyze links between aesthetics, information processing, and information theory. Max Bense, for example, built on Birkhoff&#x27;s aesthetic measure and proposed a similar information theoretic measure formula_2, where formula_3 is the redundancy and formula_4 the entropy, which assigns higher value to simpler artworks.

In the 1990s, Jürgen Schmidhuber described an algorithmic theory of beauty. This theory takes the subjectivity of the observer into account and postulates that among several observations classified as comparable by a given subjective observer, the most aesthetically pleasing is the one that is encoded by the shortest description, following the direction of previous approaches. Schmidhuber&#x27;s theory explicitly distinguishes between that which is beautiful and that which is interesting, stating that interestingness corresponds to the first derivative of subjectively perceived beauty. He supposes that every observer continually tries to improve the predictability and compressibility of their observations by identifying regularities like repetition, symmetry, and fractal self-similarity.

Since about 2005, computer scientists have attempted to develop automated methods to infer aesthetic quality of images. Typically, these approaches follow a machine learning approach, where large numbers of manually rated photographs are used to &quot;teach&quot; a computer about what visual properties are of relevance to aesthetic quality. A study by Y. Li and C. J. Hu employed Birkhoff&#x27;s measurement in their statistical learning approach where order and complexity of an image determined aesthetic value. The image complexity was computed using information theory while the order was determined using fractal compression. There is also the case of the Acquine engine, developed at Penn State University, that rates natural photographs uploaded by users.

There have also been relatively successful attempts with regard to chess and music. Computational approaches have also been attempted in film making as demonstrated by a software model developed by Chitra Dorai and a group of researchers at the IBM T. J. Watson Research Center. The tool predicted aesthetics based on the values of narrative elements. A relation between Max Bense&#x27;s mathematical formulation of aesthetics in terms of &quot;redundancy&quot; and &quot;complexity&quot; and theories of musical anticipation was offered using the notion of Information Rate.

===Evolutionary aesthetics===

Evolutionary aesthetics refers to evolutionary psychology theories in which the basic aesthetic preferences of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; are argued to have evolved in order to enhance survival and reproductive success. One example being that humans are argued to find beautiful and prefer landscapes which were good habitats in the ancestral environment. Another example is that body symmetry and proportion are important aspects of physical attractiveness which may be due to this indicating good health during body growth. Evolutionary explanations for aesthetical preferences are important parts of evolutionary musicology, Darwinian literary studies, and the study of the evolution of emotion.

===Applied aesthetics===
As well as being applied to art, aesthetics can also be applied to cultural objects, such as crosses or tools. For example, aesthetic coupling between art-objects and medical topics was made by speakers working for the US Information Agency. Art slides were linked to slides of pharmacological data, which improved attention and retention by simultaneous activation of intuitive right brain with rational left. It can also be used in topics as diverse as cartography, mathematics, gastronomy, fashion and website design.

===Other approaches===
Guy Sircello has pioneered efforts in analytic philosophy to develop a rigorous theory of aesthetics, focusing on the concepts of beauty, love and sublimity. In contrast to romantic theorists, Sircello argued for the objectivity of beauty and formulated a theory of love on that basis.

British philosopher and theorist of conceptual art aesthetics, Peter Osborne, makes the point that &quot;&#x27;post-conceptual art&#x27; aesthetic does not concern a particular type of contemporary art so much as the historical-ontological condition for the production of contemporary art in general ...&quot;. Osborne noted that contemporary art is &#x27;post-conceptual&#x27; in a public lecture delivered in 2010.

Gary Tedman has put forward a theory of a subjectless aesthetics derived from Karl Marx&#x27;s concept of alienation, and Louis Althusser&#x27;s antihumanism, using elements of Freud&#x27;s group psychology, defining a concept of the &#x27;aesthetic level of practice&#x27;.

Gregory Loewen has suggested that the subject is key in the interaction with the aesthetic object. The work of art serves as a vehicle for the projection of the individual&#x27;s identity into the world of objects, as well as being the irruptive source of much of what is uncanny in modern life. As well, art is used to memorialize individuated biographies in a manner that allows persons to imagine that they are part of something greater than themselves.

==Criticism==
The philosophy of aesthetics as a practice has been criticized by some sociologists and writers of art and society. Raymond Williams, for example, argues that there is no unique and or individual aesthetic object which can be extrapolated from the art world, but rather that there is a continuum of cultural forms and experience of which ordinary speech and experiences may signal as art. By &quot;art&quot; we may frame several artistic &quot;works&quot; or &quot;creations&quot; as so though this reference remains within the institution or special event which creates it and this leaves some works or other possible &quot;art&quot; outside of the frame work, or other interpretations such as other phenomenon which may not be considered as &quot;art&quot;.

Pierre Bourdieu disagrees with Kant&#x27;s idea of the &quot;aesthetic&quot;. He argues that Kant&#x27;s &quot;aesthetic&quot; merely represents an experience that is the product of an elevated class habitus and scholarly leisure as opposed to other possible and equally valid &quot;aesthetic&quot; experiences which lay outside Kant&#x27;s narrow definition.

Timothy Laurie argues that theories of musical aesthetics &quot;framed entirely in terms of appreciation, contemplation or reflection risk idealizing an implausibly unmotivated listener defined solely through musical objects, rather than seeing them as a person for whom complex intentions and motivations produce variable attractions to cultural objects and practices&quot;.

<text>The Ark of the Covenant, also known as the Ark of the Testimony or the Ark of God, is a purported religious storage and relic held to be the most sacred object by the Israelites.

Religious tradition describes it as a wooden storage chest decorated in solid gold accompanied by an ornamental lid known as the Seat of Mercy. According to the Book of Exodus and First Book of Kings in the Hebrew Bible and the Old Testament, the Ark contained the Tablets of the Law, by which God delivered the Ten Commandments to Moses at Mount Sinai. According to the Book of Exodus, the Book of Numbers, and the Epistle to the Hebrews in the New Testament, it also contained Aaron&#x27;s rod and a pot of manna.

The biblical account relates that approximately one year after the Israelites&#x27; exodus from Egypt, the Ark was created according to the pattern that God gave to Moses when the Israelites were encamped at the foot of Mount Sinai. Thereafter, the gold-plated acacia chest&#x27;s staves were lifted and carried by the Levites approximately 2,000 cubits () in advance of the people while they marched. God spoke with Moses &quot;from between the two cherubim&quot; on the Ark&#x27;s cover.

There are ongoing academic discussions about whether there were multiple arks, whether the original Ark contained a statue of Yahweh, and about the implications of a recent excavation at Kiriath Jearim for the historical reconstruction of the Ark. There is additional scholarly debate over possible historical influences that led to the creation of the Ark. Thomas Römer sees Bedouin influence, while Scott Noegel sees Egyptian influence.

==Biblical account==
===Construction and description===

According to the Book of Exodus, God instructed Moses to build the Ark during his 40-day stay upon Mount Sinai. He was shown the pattern for the tabernacle and furnishings of the Ark, and told that it would be made of shittim wood (also known as acacia wood) to house the Tablets of Stone. Moses instructed Bezalel and Aholiab to construct the Ark.

The Book of Exodus gives detailed instructions on how the Ark is to be constructed. It is to be cubits in length, cubits breadth, and cubits height (approximately ) of acacia wood. Then it is to be gilded entirely with gold, and a crown or molding of gold is to be put around it. Four rings of gold are to be attached to its four corners, two on each side—and through these rings staves of shittim wood overlaid with gold for carrying the Ark are to be inserted; and these are not to be removed.

===Mobile vanguard===
The biblical account continues that, after its creation by Moses, the Ark was carried by the Israelites during their 40 years of wandering in the desert. Whenever the Israelites camped, the Ark was placed in the tent of meeting, inside the Tabernacle.

When the Israelites, led by Joshua toward the Promised Land, arrived at the banks of the River Jordan, the Ark was carried in the lead, preceding the people, and was the signal for their advance. During the crossing, the river grew dry as soon as the feet of the priests carrying the Ark touched its waters, and remained so until the priests—with the Ark—left the river after the people had passed over. As memorials, twelve stones were taken from the Jordan at the place where the priests had stood.

During the Battle of Jericho, the Ark was carried around the city once a day for six days, preceded by the armed men and seven priests sounding seven trumpets of rams&#x27; horns. On the seventh day, the seven priests sounding the seven trumpets of rams&#x27; horns before the Ark compassed the city seven times, and, with a great shout, Jericho&#x27;s wall fell down flat and the people took the city.

After the defeat at Ai, Joshua lamented before the Ark. When Joshua read the Law to the people between Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal, they stood on each side of the Ark. The Ark was then kept at Shiloh after the Israelites finished their conquest of Canaan. We next hear of the Ark in Bethel, where it was being cared for by the priest Phinehas, the grandson of Aaron. According to this verse, it was consulted by the people of Israel when they were planning to attack the Benjaminites at the Battle of Gibeah. Later the Ark was kept at Shiloh again, where it was cared for by Hophni and Phinehas, two sons of Eli.

===Capture by the Philistines===
According to the biblical narrative, a few years later the elders of Israel decided to take the Ark onto the battlefield to assist them against the Philistines, having recently been defeated at the battle of Eben-Ezer. They were again heavily defeated, with the loss of 30,000 men. The Ark was captured by the Philistines, and Hophni and Phinehas were killed. The news of its capture was at once taken to Shiloh by a messenger &quot;with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head&quot;. The old priest, Eli, fell dead when he heard it, and his daughter-in-law, bearing a son at the time the news of the Ark&#x27;s capture was received, named him Ichabod—explained as &quot;The glory has departed Israel&quot; in reference to the loss of the Ark. Ichabod&#x27;s mother died at his birth.

The Philistines took the Ark to several places in their country, and at each place misfortune befell them. At Ashdod it was placed in the temple of Dagon. The next morning Dagon was found prostrate, bowed down, before it; and on being restored to his place, he was on the following morning again found prostrate and broken. The people of Ashdod were smitten with tumors; a plague of rodents was sent over the land. This may have been the bubonic plague. The affliction of tumours was also visited upon the people of Gath and of Ekron, whither the Ark was successively removed.

===Return of the Ark to the Israelites===

After the Ark had been among them for seven months, the Philistines, on the advice of their diviners, returned it to the Israelites, accompanying its return with an offering consisting of golden images of the tumors and mice wherewith they had been afflicted. The Ark was set up in the field of Joshua of Beit Shemesh, and the people of Beit Shemesh offered sacrifices and burnt offerings according to the first five verses of 1 Samuel 6. In verse 9, 1 Samuel 6 states that out of curiosity, the people of Beit Shemesh gazed at the Ark, and as a punishment, God struck down seventy of them (fifty thousand and seventy in some translations). The men of Beit Shemesh sent to Qiryath Ye&#x27;arim to have the Ark removed in verse 21, and it was taken to the house of Abinadab, whose son Eleazar was sanctified to keep it. Qiryath Ye&#x27;arim remained the abode of the Ark for twenty years, according to 1 Samuel 7.

Under Saul, the Ark was with the army before he first met the Philistines, but the king was too impatient to consult it before engaging in battle. In 1 Chronicles 13:3, it is stated that the people were not accustomed to consulting the Ark in the days of Saul.

===During the reign of King David===

In the biblical narrative, at the beginning of his reign over the United Monarchy, King David removed the Ark from Kirjath-jearim amid great rejoicing. On the way to Zion, Uzzah, one of the drivers of the cart that carried the Ark, put out his hand to steady the Ark, and was struck dead by God for touching it. The place was subsequently named &quot;Perez-Uzzah&quot;, literally , as a result. David, in fear, carried the Ark aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite, instead of carrying it on to Zion, and it stayed there for three months.

On hearing that God had blessed Obed-edom because of the presence of the Ark in his house, David had the Ark brought to Zion by the Levites, while he himself, &quot;girded with a linen ephod[...] danced before the Lord with all his might&quot; and in the sight of all the public gathered in Jerusalem, a performance which caused him to be scornfully rebuked by his first wife, Saul&#x27;s daughter Michal. In Zion, David put the Ark in the tent he had prepared for it, offered sacrifices, distributed food, and blessed the people and his own household. David used the tent as a personal place of prayer.

The Levites were appointed to minister before the Ark. David&#x27;s plan of building a temple for the Ark was stopped on the advice of the prophet Nathan. The Ark was with the army during the siege of Rabbah; and when David fled from Jerusalem at the time of Absalom&#x27;s conspiracy, the Ark was carried along with him until he ordered Zadok the priest to return it to Jerusalem.

===The Temple of King Solomon===

According to the Biblical narrative, when Abiathar was dismissed from the priesthood by King Solomon for having taken part in Adonijah&#x27;s conspiracy against David, his life was spared because he had formerly borne the Ark. Solomon worshipped before the Ark after his dream in which God promised him wisdom.

During the construction of Solomon&#x27;s Temple, a special inner room, named (&#x27;Holy of Holies&#x27;), was prepared to receive and house the Ark; and when the Temple was dedicated, the Ark—containing the original tablets of the Ten Commandments—was placed therein. When the priests emerged from the holy place after placing the Ark there, the Temple was filled with a cloud, &quot;for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord&quot;.

When Solomon married Pharaoh&#x27;s daughter, he caused her to dwell in a house outside Zion, as Zion was consecrated because it contained the Ark. King Josiah also had the Ark returned to the Temple, from which it appears to have been removed by one of his predecessors (cf. 2 Chronicles 33–34 and 2 Kings 21–23).

===During the reign of King Hezekiah===

Prior to king Josiah who is the last biblical figure mentioned as having seen the Ark, king Hezekiah had seen the Ark. Hezekiah is also known for protecting Jerusalem against the Assyrian Empire by improving the city walls and diverting the waters of the Gihon Spring through a tunnel known today as Hezekiah&#x27;s Tunnel, which channeled the water inside the city walls to the Pool of Siloam.

In a noncanonical text known as the Treatise of the Vessels, Hezekiah is identified as one of the kings who had the Ark and the other treasures of Solomon&#x27;s Temple hidden during a time of crisis. This text lists the following hiding places, which it says were recorded on a bronze tablet: (1) a spring named Kohel or Kahal with pure water in a valley with a stopped-up gate; (2) a spring named Kotel (or &quot;wall&quot; in Hebrew); (3) a spring named Zedekiah; (4) an unidentified cistern; (5) Mount Carmel; and (6) locations in Babylon.

To many scholars, Hezekiah is also credited as having written all or some of the Book of Kohelet (Ecclesiastes in the Christian tradition), in particular the famously enigmatic epilogue. Notably, the epilogue appears to refer to the Ark story with references to almond blossoms (i.e., Aaron&#x27;s rod), locusts, silver, and gold. The epilogue then cryptically refers to a pitcher broken at a fountain and a wheel broken at a cistern.

Although scholars disagree on whether the Pool of Siloam&#x27;s pure spring waters were used by pilgrims for ritual purification, many scholars agree that a stepped pilgrimage road between the pool and the Temple had been built in the first century CE. This roadway has been partially excavated, but the west side of the Pool of Siloam remains unexcavated.

===The invasion of the Kingdom of Babylon===
In 587 BC, when the Babylonians destroyed Jerusalem, an ancient Greek version of the biblical third Book of Ezra, 1 Esdras, suggests that Babylonians took away the vessels of the ark of God, but does not mention taking away the Ark:

In Rabbinic literature, the final disposition of the Ark is disputed. Some rabbis hold that it must have been carried off to Babylon, while others hold that it must have been hidden lest it be carried off into Babylon and never brought back. A late 2nd-century rabbinic work known as the states the opinions of these rabbis that Josiah, the king of Judah, stored away the Ark, along with the jar of manna, and a jar containing the holy anointing oil, the rod of Aaron which budded and a chest given to Israel by the Philistines.

===Service of the Kohathites===

The Kohathites were one of the Levite houses from the Book of Numbers. Theirs was the responsibility to care for &quot;the most holy things&quot; in the tabernacle. When the camp, then wandering the Wilderness, set out the Kohathites would enter the tabernacle with Aaron and cover the ark with the screening curtain and &quot;then they shall put on it a covering of fine leather, and spread over that a cloth all of blue, and shall put its poles in place.&quot; The ark was one of the items of the tent of meeting that the Kohathites were responsible for carrying.

==Jewish tradition on location today==

The Talmud in Yoma suggests that the Ark was removed from the Temple towards the end of the era of the First Temple and the Second Temple never housed it. According to one view, it was taken to Babylon when Nebuchadnezzar conquered Jerusalem in 587 BCE, exiling King Jeconiah along with the upper classes.

Another perspective proposes that Josiah, king of Judah, hid the Ark in anticipation of the Temple&#x27;s destruction. Where it was hidden remains uncertain. One account in the Talmud mentions a priest&#x27;s suspicion of a tampered stone in a chamber designated for wood storage, hinting at the Ark&#x27;s concealment.

Alternatively, it&#x27;s suggested that the Ark remained underground in the Holy of Holies. Some of the Chazal, including the Radak and Maimonides, propose that Solomon designed tunnels beneath the Temple to safeguard the Ark that Josiah later used. Attempts to excavate this area have yielded little due to political sensitivities.

An opinion found in the II Maccabees 2:4-10, asserts that Jeremiah hid the Ark and other sacred items in a cave on Mount Nebo (now in Jordan), anticipating the Neo-Babylonian invasion.

==Archaeology and historical context==

Archaeological evidence shows strong cultic activity at Kiriath-Jearim in the 8th and 7th centuries BC, well after the ark was supposedly removed from there to Jerusalem. In particular, archaeologists found a large elevated podium, associated with the Northern Kingdom and not the Southern Kingdom, which may have been a shrine. Thomas Römer suggests that this may indicate that the ark was not moved to Jerusalem until much later, possibly during the reign of King Josiah (reigned ). He notes that this might explain why the ark featured prominently in the history before Solomon, but not after. Additionally, 2 Chronicles 35:3 indicates that it was moved during King Josiah&#x27;s reign. However, Yigal Levin argues that there is no evidence that Kiriath-Jearim was a cultic center in the monarchical era or that it ever housed any &quot;temple of the Ark&quot;.

Some scholars believe the story of the Ark was written independently around the 8th century BC in a text referred to as the &quot;Ark Narrative&quot; and then incorporated into the main biblical narrative just before the Babylonian exile.

Römer also suggests that the ark may have originally carried sacred stones &quot;of the kind found in the chests of pre-Islamic Bedouins&quot; and speculates that these may have been either a statue of Yahweh or a pair of statues depicting both Yahweh and his companion goddess Asherah. In contrast, Scott Noegel has argued that the parallels between the ark and these practices &quot;remain unconvincing&quot; in part because the Bedouin objects lack the ark&#x27;s distinctive structure, function, and mode of transportation. Specifically, unlike the ark, the Bedouin chests &quot;contained no box, no lid, and no poles,&quot; they did not serve as the throne or footstool of a god, they were not overlaid with gold, did not have kerubim figures upon them, there were no restrictions on who could touch them, and they were transported on horses or camels.

Noegel suggests that the ancient Egyptian Solar barque is a more plausible model for the Israelite ark, since Egyptian barques had all the features just mentioned. Noegel adds that the Egyptians also were known to place written covenants beneath the feet of statues, proving a further parallel to the placement of the covenantal tablets inside the ark.

Yigal Levin holds that some biblical texts suggest that the Ark of the Covenant was only one among many other different arks at regional shrines prior to the centralization of worship in Jerusalem, although other scholars disagree. While one author has questioned whether the Ark ever existed, other scholars have defended its historicity and antiquity based on significant parallels with similar artifacts from New Kingdom Egypt.

==References in Abrahamic religions==

===Tanakh===

The Ark is first mentioned in the Book of Exodus and then numerous times in Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, I Samuel, II Samuel, I Kings, I Chronicles, II Chronicles, Psalms, and Jeremiah.

In the Book of Jeremiah, it is referenced by Jeremiah, who, speaking in the days of Josiah, prophesied a future time, possibly the end of days, when the Ark will no longer be talked about or be made use of again:

Rashi comments on this verse that &quot;The entire people will be so imbued with the spirit of sanctity that God&#x27;s Presence will rest upon them collectively, as if the congregation itself was the Ark of the Covenant.&quot;

===Second Book of Maccabees===

According to Second Maccabees, at the beginning of chapter 2:

The &quot;mountain from the top of which Moses saw God&#x27;s promised land&quot; would be Mount Nebo, located in what is now Jordan.

===Samaritan tradition===
Samaritan tradition claims that the Ark of the Covenant had been kept at a sanctuary on Mt. Gerizim.

===New Testament===
====The physical ark of the Old Testament====
In the New Testament, the Ark is mentioned in the Letter to the Hebrews and the Revelation to St. John. Hebrews 9:4 states that the Ark contained &quot;the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron&#x27;s rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant.&quot; says the prophet saw God&#x27;s temple in heaven opened, &quot;and the ark of his covenant was seen within his temple.&quot;

====The Blessed Virgin Mary as the “New Ark”====
In the Gospel of Luke, the author&#x27;s accounts of the Annunciation and Visitation are constructed using eight points of literary parallelism to compare Mary to the Ark.

The contents of the ark are seen by theologians such as the Church Fathers and Thomas Aquinas as personified by Jesus Christ: the manna as the Holy Eucharist; Aaron&#x27;s rod as Jesus&#x27; eternal priestly authority; and the tablets of the Law, as the Lawgiver himself.

Catholic scholars connect the pregnant, birthing Woman of the Apocalypse from Revelation 12:1-2, with the Blessed Virgin Mary, whom they identify as the &quot;Ark of the New Covenant.&quot; Carrying the saviour of mankind within her, she herself became the Holy of Holies. This is the interpretation given in the third century by Gregory Thaumaturgus, and in the fourth century by Saint Ambrose, Saint Ephraem of Syria and Saint Augustine. The Catechism of the Catholic Church teaches that Mary is a metaphorical version of the ark: &quot;Mary, in whom the Lord himself has just made his dwelling, is the daughter of Zion in person, the ark of the covenant, the place where the glory of the Lord dwells. She is &#x27;the dwelling of God[...] with men.&quot;

Saint Athanasius, the bishop of Alexandria, is credited with writing about the connections between the Ark and the Virgin Mary: &quot;O noble Virgin, truly you are greater than any other greatness. For who is your equal in greatness, O dwelling place of God the Word? To whom among all creatures shall I compare you, O Virgin? You are greater than them all O (Ark of the) Covenant, clothed with purity instead of gold! You are the Ark in which is found the golden vessel containing the true manna, that is, the flesh in which Divinity resides&quot; (&quot;Homily of the Papyrus of Turin&quot;).

===Quran===
The Ark is referred to in the Quran (Surah Al-Baqara: 248):
===The Ark in other faiths ===
According to Uri Rubin, the Ark of the Covenant has a religious basis in Islam (and the Baháʼí Faith), which gives it special significance.

==Claims of current status==

===According to the Book of Maccabees===
The Book of 2 Maccabees 2:4–10, written around 100 B.C. claims that the prophet Jeremiah, following “being warned by God&quot; before the Babylonian invasion, took the Ark, the Tabernacle, and the Altar of Incense, and buried them in a cave, informing those of his followers who wished to find the place that it should remain unknown &quot;until the time that God should gather His people again together, and receive them unto mercy.&quot;

===Ethiopia===

The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church claims to possess the Ark of the Covenant in Axum. The Ark is kept under guard in a treasury near the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion. Replicas of the tablets within the Ark, or &quot;tabots&quot;, are kept in every Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. Each tabot is kept in its own holy of holies, each with its own dedication to a particular saint; the most popular of these include Saint Mary, Saint George and Saint Michael.

The &quot;Kebra Nagast&quot; is often said to have been composed to legitimise the Solomonic dynasty, which ruled the Ethiopian Empire following its establishment in 1270, but this is not the case. It was originally composed in some other language (Coptic or Greek), then translated into Arabic, and translated into Geʽez in 1321. It narrates how the Ark of the Covenant was brought to Ethiopia by Menelik I with divine assistance, while a forgery was left in the Temple in Jerusalem. Although the &quot;Kebra Nagast&quot; is the best-known account of this belief, the belief predates the document. Abu al-Makarim, writing in the last quarter of the twelfth century, makes one early reference to this belief that they possessed the Ark. &quot;The Abyssinians possess also the Ark of the Covenant&quot;, he wrote, and, after a description of the object, describes how the liturgy is celebrated upon the Ark four times a year, &quot;on the feast of the great nativity, on the feast of the glorious Baptism, on the feast of the holy Resurrection, and on the feast of the illuminating Cross.&quot;

In his controversial 1992 book &quot;The Sign and the Seal&quot;, British writer Graham Hancock reports on the Ethiopian belief that the ark spent several years in Egypt before it came to Ethiopia via the Nile River, where it was kept on the islands of Lake Tana for about four hundred years and finally taken to Axum. Archaeologist John Holladay of the University of Toronto called Hancock&#x27;s theory &quot;garbage and hogwash&quot;; Edward Ullendorff, a former professor of Ethiopian Studies at the University of London, said he &quot;wasted a lot of time reading it.&quot; In a 1992 interview, Ullendorff says that he examined the ark held in the church in Axum in 1941. Describing the ark there, he says, &quot;They have a wooden box, but it&#x27;s empty. Middle- to late-medieval construction, when these were fabricated ad hoc.&quot;

On 25 June 2009, the patriarch of the Orthodox Church of Ethiopia, Abune Paulos, said he would announce to the world the next day the unveiling of the Ark of the Covenant, which he said had been kept safe and secure in a church in Axum. The following day, he announced that he would not unveil the Ark after all, but that instead he could attest to its current status.

===Southern Africa===
The Lemba people of South Africa and Zimbabwe have claimed that their ancestors carried the Ark south, calling it the &quot;ngoma lungundu&quot; &quot;voice of God&quot;, eventually hiding it in a deep cave in the Dumghe mountains, their spiritual home.

On 14 April 2008, in a UK Channel 4 documentary, Tudor Parfitt, taking a literalist approach to the Biblical story, described his research into this claim. He says that the object described by the Lemba has attributes similar to the Ark. It was of similar size, was carried on poles by priests, was not allowed to touch the ground, was revered as a voice of their God, and was used as a weapon of great power, sweeping enemies aside.

In his book &quot;The Lost Ark of the Covenant&quot; (2008), Parfitt also suggests that the Ark was taken to Arabia following the events depicted in the Second Book of Maccabees, and cites Arabic sources which maintain it was brought in distant times to Yemen. Genetic Y-DNA analyses in the 2000s have established a partially Middle-Eastern origin for a portion of the male Lemba population but no specific Jewish connection. Lemba tradition maintains that the Ark spent some time in a place called Sena, which might be Sena, Yemen. Later, it was taken across the sea to East Africa and may have been taken inland at the time of Great Zimbabwe. According to their oral traditions, it self-destructed sometime after the Lemba&#x27;s arrival with the Ark. Using a core from the original, the Lemba priests constructed a new one. This replica was discovered in a cave by a Swedish-German missionary named Harald Philip Hans von Sicard in the 1940s and eventually found its way to the Museum of Human Science in Harare.

===Europe===

====Rome====
The 2nd century Rabbi Eliezer ben José claimed that he saw somewhere in Rome the mercy-seat lid of the ark. According to his account, a bloodstain was present and was told that it was a stain from the blood which the Jewish high priest sprinkled thereon on the Day of Atonement.&quot;

Accordingly, another tale claims that the Ark was kept within the Basilica of Saint John Lateran, surviving the pillages of Rome by King of the Visigoths Alaric I and King of the Vandals Gaiseric but was eventually lost when the basilica burned in the fifth century.

====Ireland====
Between 1899 and 1902, the British-Israel Association of London carried out limited excavations of the Hill of Tara in Ireland looking for the Ark of the Covenant. The Irish nationalists including Maud Gonne and the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland (RSAI) campaigned successfully to have them stopped before they destroyed the hill. A non-invasive survey by archaeologist Conor Newman carried out from 1992 until 1995 found no evidence of the Ark.

The British Israelites believed that the Ark was located at the grave of the Egyptian princess Tea Tephi, who according to Irish legend came to Ireland in the 6th century BC and married Irish King Érimón. Because of the historical importance of Tara, Irish nationalists like Douglas Hyde and W. B. Yeats voiced their protests in newspapers and in 1902 Maud Gonne led a protest against the excavations at the site.

==In literature and the arts==
Philip Kaufman conceived of the Ark of the Covenant as the main plot device of Steven Spielberg&#x27;s 1981 adventure film &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, where it is found by Indiana Jones in the Egyptian city of Tanis in 1936. In early 2020, a prop version made for the film (which does not actually appear onscreen) was featured on television series &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot;.

In the Danish family film &quot;The Lost Treasure of the Knights Templar&quot; from 2006, the main part of the treasure found in the end is the Ark of the Covenant. The power of the Ark comes from static electricity stored in separated metal plates like a giant Leyden jar.

In Harry Turtledove&#x27;s novel &quot;Alpha and Omega&quot; (2019) the ark is found by archeologists, and the characters have to deal with the proven existence of God.

The Ark has been depicted many times in art for two thousand years, some examples are in the article above, a few more are here.
==Yom HaAliyah==
Yom HaAliyah (Aliyah Day) () is an Israeli national holiday celebrated annually on the tenth of the Hebrew month of Nisan to commemorate the Israelites crossing the Jordan River into the Land of Israel while carrying the Ark of the Covenant.

<doc id="2136" wikidata="Q104238" url="?curid=2136" title="Angles (tribe)">
<text>The Angles were one of the main Germanic peoples who settled in Great Britain in the post-Roman period. They founded several kingdoms of the Heptarchy in Anglo-Saxon England. Their name, which probably derives from the Angeln peninsula, is the root of the name &quot;England&quot; (&quot;Engla land&quot; or &quot;Ængla land&quot;), as well as ultimately the word &quot;English&quot; for its people and language. According to Tacitus, writing around 100 AD, a people known as Angles (Anglii) lived beyond (apparently northeast of) the Lombards and Semnones, who lived near the River Elbe.

==Etymology==
The name of the Angles may have been first recorded in Latinised form, as &quot;Anglii&quot;, in the &quot;Germania&quot; of Tacitus. It is thought to derive from the name of the area they originally inhabited, the Angeln peninsula, which is on the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein. 

Two related theories have been advanced, which attempt to give the name a Germanic etymology:
# It originated from the Germanic root for &quot;narrow&quot; (compare German and Dutch &quot;eng&quot; = &quot;narrow&quot;), meaning &quot;the Narrow [Water]&quot;, i.e., the Schlei estuary; the root would be &quot;*h₂enǵʰ&quot;, &quot;tight&quot;. 
# The name derives from &quot;hook&quot; (as in angling for fish), in reference to the shape of the peninsula where they lived; Indo-European linguist Julius Pokorny derives it from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*h₂enk-&quot;, &quot;bend&quot; (see ankle). Alternatively, the Angles may have been called such because they were a fishing people or were originally descended from such.

According to , Dan and Angul were made rulers by the consent of their people because of their bravery. The Danes and Angles are respectively named from them.

==Greco-Roman historiography==

===Tacitus===

The earliest surviving mention of the Angles is in chapter 40 of Tacitus&#x27;s &quot;Germania&quot; written around AD 98. Tacitus describes the &quot;Anglii&quot; as one of the more remote Suebic tribes compared to the Semnones and Langobardi, who lived near the Elbe and were better known to the Romans. He grouped the Angles with several other tribes in that region, the Reudigni, Aviones, Varini, Eudoses, Suarines, and Nuithones. According to Tacitus, they were all living behind ramparts of rivers and woods, and therefore inaccessible to attack.

He gives no precise indication of their geographical situation but states that, together with the six other tribes, they worshipped Nerthus, or Mother Earth, whose sanctuary was located on &quot;an island in the Ocean&quot;. The Eudoses are generally considered to be the Jutes and these names have been associated with localities in Jutland or on the Baltic coast. The coast contains sufficient estuaries, inlets, rivers, islands, swamps, and marshes to have been inaccessible to those not familiar with the terrain, such as the Romans, who considered it unknown and inaccessible.

The majority of scholars believe that the Anglii lived on the coasts of the Baltic Sea, probably in the southern part of the Jutland peninsula. This view is based partly on Old English and Danish traditions regarding persons and events of the fourth century, and partly because striking affinities to the cult of Nerthus as described by Tacitus are to be found in pre-Christian Scandinavian religion.

===Ptolemy===
Surviving versions of the work of Ptolemy, who wrote around AD 150, in his &quot;Geography&quot; (2.10), describes the Angles in a confusing manner. In one passage, the &quot;Sueboi Angeilloi&quot; (or &quot;Suevi Angili&quot;), are described as living inland between the northern Rhine and central Elbe, but apparently not touching either river, with the Suebic Langobardi on the Rhine to their west, and the Suebic Semnones on the Elbe stretching to their east, forming a band of Suebic peoples. This is unexpected. Owing to the uncertainty of this passage, much speculation exists regarding the original home of the Anglii. However, as pointed out by Gudmund Schütte, the neighbouring Langobards appear in two places, and the ones near the Rhine appears to be there by mistake. Schütte, in his analysis, believes that the Angles are placed correctly relative to the Langobardi to their west, but that these have been positioned in the wrong place. The Langobardi also appear in the expected position on the lower Elbe, and the Angles would be expected to their northwest, based upon Tacitus.

Another theory is that all or part of the Angles dwelt or moved among other coastal people, perhaps confederated up to the basin of the Saale (in the neighbourhood of the ancient canton of Engilin) on the Unstrut valleys below the Kyffhäuserkreis, from which region the &quot;Lex Anglorum et Werinorum hoc est Thuringorum&quot; is believed by many to have come. The ethnic names of Frisians and Warines are also attested in these Saxon districts.

===Procopius===
An especially early reference to the Angli in Britain is the 6th-century Byzantine historian Procopius who however expressed doubts about the stories he had heard about events in the west, which he apparently heard through Frankish diplomats. He never mentions the Saxons, but he states that an island called Brittia (which he believed to be distinct from Britain itself), was settled by three nations: the Angili, Frissones, and Brittones, each ruled by its own king. Each nation was so prolific that it sent large numbers of individuals every year to the Franks, who &quot;allow them to settle in the part of their land which appears to be more deserted, and by this means they say they are winning over the island. Thus it actually happened that not long ago the king of the Franks, in sending some of his intimates on an embassy to the Emperor Justinian in Byzantium, sent with them some of the Angili, thus seeking to establish his claim that this island was ruled by him.&quot; Procopius claimed that the Angles had recently sent a large army of 400 ships to Europe, from Brittia to the Rhine, to enforce a marriage agreement with the Warini who he lived north of the Franks at that time.

==Medieval historiography==
Bede (died 735) stated that the Anglii, before coming to Great Britain, dwelt in a land called Angulus, &quot;which lies between the province of the Jutes and the Saxons, and remains unpopulated to this day.&quot; Similar evidence is given by the 9th-century &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;. King Alfred the Great and the chronicler Æthelweard identified this place with Angeln, in the province of Schleswig (though it may then have been of greater extent), and this identification agrees with the indications given by Bede.

In the Norwegian seafarer Ohthere of Hålogaland&#x27;s account of a two-day voyage from the Oslo fjord to Schleswig, he reported the lands on his starboard bow, and Alfred appended the note &quot;on these islands dwelt the &quot;Engle&quot; before they came hither&quot;. Confirmation is afforded by English and Danish traditions relating to two kings named Wermund and Offa of Angel, from whom the Mercian royal family claimed descent and whose exploits are connected with Angeln, Schleswig, and Rendsburg.

Danish tradition has preserved record of two governors of Schleswig, father and son, in their service, Frowinus (Freawine) and Wigo (Wig), from whom the royal family of Wessex claimed descent. During the fifth century, the Anglii invaded Great Britain, after which time their name does not recur on the continent except in the title of the legal code issued to the Thuringians: &quot;Lex Angliorum et Werinorum hoc est Thuringorum&quot;.

The Angles are the subject of a legend about Pope Gregory I, who happened to see a group of Angle children from Deira for sale as slaves in the Roman market. As the story was told by Bede, Gregory was struck by the unusual appearance of the slaves and asked about their background. When told they were called &quot;Anglii&quot; (Angles), he replied with a Latin pun that translates well into English: &quot;Bene, nam et angelicam habent faciem, et tales angelorum in caelis decet esse coheredes&quot; (It is well, for they have an angelic face, and such people ought to be co-heirs of the angels in heaven). Supposedly, this encounter inspired the pope to launch a mission to bring Christianity to their countrymen.

==Archaeology==
The province of Schleswig has proved rich in prehistoric antiquities that date apparently from the fourth and fifth centuries. A large cremation cemetery has been found at Borgstedt, between Rendsburg and Eckernförde, and it has yielded many urns and brooches closely resembling those found in pagan graves in England. Of still greater importance are the great deposits at Thorsberg moor (in Angeln) and Nydam, which contained large quantities of arms, ornaments, articles of clothing, agricultural implements, etc., and in Nydam, even ships. By the help of these discoveries, Angle culture in the age preceding the invasion of Britannia can be pieced together.

==Anglian kingdoms in England==
According to sources such as the &quot;History&quot; of Bede, after the invasion of Britannia, the Angles split up and founded the kingdoms of Northumbria, East Anglia, and Mercia. H. R. Loyn has observed in this context that &quot;a sea voyage is perilous to tribal institutions&quot;, and the apparently tribe-based kingdoms were formed in England. Early times had two northern kingdoms (Bernicia and Deira) and two midland ones (Middle Anglia and Mercia), which had by the seventh century resolved themselves into two Angle kingdoms, viz., Northumbria and Mercia.

Northumbria held suzerainty amidst the Germanic presence in the British Isles in the 7th century, but was eclipsed by the rise of Mercia in the 8th century. Both kingdoms fell in the great assaults of the Danish Viking armies in the 9th century. Their royal houses were effectively destroyed in the fighting, and their Angle populations came under the Danelaw. Further south, the Saxon kings of Wessex withstood the Danish assaults. Then in the late 9th and early 10th centuries, the kings of Wessex defeated the Danes and liberated the Angles from the Danelaw.

They united their house in marriage with the surviving Angle royalty, and were accepted by the Angles as their kings. This marked the passing of the old Anglo-Saxon world and the dawn of the &quot;English&quot; as a new people. The regions of East Anglia and Northumbria are still known by their original titles. Northumbria once stretched as far north as what is now southeast Scotland, including Edinburgh, and as far south as the Humber estuary and even the river Witham.

The rest of that people stayed at the centre of the Angle homeland in the northeastern portion of the modern German &quot;Bundesland&quot; of Schleswig-Holstein, on the Jutland Peninsula. There, a small peninsular area is still called Angeln today and is formed as a triangle drawn roughly from modern Flensburg on the Flensburger Fjord to the City of Schleswig and then to Maasholm, on the Schlei inlet.

<text>The Aster CT-80 is a 1982 personal computer developed by the small Dutch company MCP (later renamed to Aster Computers), was sold in its first incarnation as a kit for hobbyists. Later it was sold ready to use. It consisted of several Eurocard PCB&#x27;s with DIN 41612 connectors, and a backplane all based on a 19-inch rack configuration. It was the first commercially available Dutch personal/home computer. The Aster computer could use the software written for the popular Tandy TRS-80 computer while fixing many of the problems of that computer, but it could also run CP/M software, with a large amount of free memory Transient Program Area, (TPA) and a full 80×25 display, and it could be used as a Videotext terminal. Although the Aster was a clone of the TRS-80 Model I it was in fact more compatible with the TRS-80 Model III and ran all the software of these systems including games. It also had a built-in speaker which was compatible with such games software.

==Models==
Three models were sold. The first model (launched June 1982) looked like the IBM PC, a rectangular base unit with two floppy drives on the front, and a monitor on top with a separate detachable keyboard. The second incarnation was a much smaller unit the width of two 5&quot; floppy drives stacked on top of each other, and the third incarnation looked like a flattened Apple with a built-in keyboard.

All units ran much faster than the original TRS-80, at 4 MHz, (with a software selectable throttle to the original speed for compatibility purposes) and the display supported upper and lower case, hardware snow suppression (video ram bus arbitration logic), and an improved character font set. The floppy disk interface supported dual density, and disk capacities up to 800 KB, more than four times the capacity of the original TRS-80. A special version of NewDos/80, (an improved TRS-DOS compatible Disk operating system) was used to support these disk capacities when using the TRS-80 compatibility mode.

For the educational market a version of the first model was produced with a new plastic enclosure (the First Asters had an all-metal enclosure) that also had an opening on the top in which a cassette recorder could be placed. This model was used in a cluster with one Aster (with disk drives) for the teacher, and eight disk less versions for the pupils. The pupils could download software from the teachers computer through a network based on a fast serial connection, as well as sending back their work to the teachers computer. There was also hardware in place through which the teacher could see the display of each pupils screen on his own monitor.

==Working modes==
The Aster used 64 KB of RAM and had the unique feature of supporting two fundamentally different internal architectures: when turned on without a boot floppy or with a TRS-DOS floppy, the Aster would be fully TRS-80 compatible, with 48 KB of RAM. When the boot loader detected a CP/M floppy, the Aster would reconfigure its internal memory architecture on the fly to optimally support CP/M with 60 KB free RAM for programs (TPA) and an 80 x 25 display. This dual-architecture capability only existed on one other TRS-80 clone, the LOBO Max-80.

With a special configuration tool, the CT-80 could reconfigure its floppy drivers to read and write the floppies of about 80 other CP/M systems.

A third mode was entered with a special boot floppy which turned the Aster into a Videotex terminal with a 40x25 display and a Videotex character set, The software used the built in RS-232 interface of the Aster to control a modem through which it could contact a Prestel service provider.

==Sales==

Most Aster CT-80&#x27;s (about 10 thousand of them) were sold to schools for computer education, in a project first known as the &quot;honderd scholen project&quot; (one hundred schools project), but which later involved many more than just one hundred schools. MCP received this order from the Dutch government because their computer met all the technical and other demands, including the demand that the computers should be of Dutch origin and should be built in the Netherlands. Another important demand was that the computers could be used in a network (Aster developed special software and hardware for that). Later however the Government turned around and gave 50% of the order to Philips and their P2000 homecomputer even though the P2000 did not meet all the technical demands, was made in Austria and did not have network hardware nor software.

==Company==

Aster computers was based in the small town of Arkel near the town of Gorinchem.
Initially Aster computer b.v. was called MCP (Music print Computer Product), because it was specialized in producing computer assisted printing of sheet music. The director of the company was interested in Microprocessor technology and noticed there was a market for selling kits to computer building amateurs, so they started selling electronic kits to hobbyists, and employed four persons at that time . They also assembled kits for people without soldering skills, especially the &quot;junior Computer&quot; from Elektor (a copy of the KIM-1), and the ZX80 from Sinclair. Among the kits sold there were also alternative floppy disk drives for TRS-80 computers. But these needed the infamous TRS-80 expansion interface, which was very expensive, and had a very unreliable floppy disk controller because it used the WD1771 floppy disk controller chip without an external &quot;data separator&quot;. To fix this problem MCP developed a small plugin board which could be plugged into the socket for the WD1771, and which contained a data separator, and a socket for the WD1791 to support dual-density operation. Still, the expansion interface was expensive and due to its design it was also unreliable. So they decided to also develop their own alternative in the form of an improved floppy disk controller and printer interface that could be built right into a floppy disk enclosure. The lack of RAM expansion offered by this solution was solved by a service in which the 16 KB RAM chips inside the base unit would be replaced by 64 KB RAM chips.
While this went on MCP renamed itself to &quot;MCP CHIP&quot; but ran into problems with the German computer magazine &quot;CHIP&quot;, and had to return to its former name. At that time MCP did also sell imported home computers like the TRS-80, the Video Genie (another TRS-80 clone), the Luxor ABC 80 and the Apple II.
They also sold the exotic Olivetti M20, a very early 16-bit personal computer that was one of the very few systems to use a Z8000 CPU.

After designing their own fully functional replacement for the TRS-80 expansion interface (which was never commercialized) the company realized that they could do better than just re-designing the expansion interface. They observed that the TRS-80 was a great computer but it lacked in several areas. The display logic and resulting display &#x27;snow&#x27; was irritating, as was the missing lower case support, the CPU speed could be improved, the quality and layout of the keyboard was bothersome, and the floppy disk capacity and reliability was low. Also the more interesting software offered for CP/M systems could not run well on a TRS-80. So they decided to design a TRS-80 and CP/M software-compatible computer system, which (following the lead of Apple Computer) they decided to name after a &quot;typical Dutch flower&quot;. So they called it the Aster CT-80 (CP/M/Tandy-1980). Why they went with Aster, and not the more well known Tulip is unknown, perhaps they thought it would be to presumptuous, or perhaps the fact that &quot;Aster&quot; is also a Dutch girls&#x27; name has something to do with it. Remarkably &quot;Aster&quot; was also the name given to a Dutch Supercomputer much later, in 2002.

The first version of the Aster consisted of four &quot;Eurocards&quot;, one Z80 CPU card with 64 KB memory, one Motorola MC6845-based video card, one double density floppy disk controller card and one &quot;keyboard/RS-232/cassette interface&quot; card. Plus a &quot;backplane card&quot;, (which connected all the other cards) and a keyboard. And was intended for hobbyists, to be sold as a kit consisting of the parts and the PCB&#x27;s for the computer and attached keyboard. After selling a few kits, MCP became convinced there was a much bigger market for an improved model sold as a completed working system. However the original kit version lacked many features that prevented its use as a serious computer system. Because the original designer had left the company another employee completely redesigned most of the system, (adding a display snow remover circuit, true 80/64 column text mode support, (with different size letters for TRS-80 and CP/M mode, so that in TRS-80 mode the full screen was also used, not just a 64×16 portion of the 80×25 screen) with an improved font set (adding &quot;gray scale&quot; version of the TRS-80 mozaik graphics and many special PETSCII like characters), and a more flexible and reliable floppy disk controller and keyboard interface plus many other small improvements), also an enclosure was developed for the main computer system, (in the form of a 19-inch rack for the Eurocards) and for two floppy disk drives and the power supply. A software engineer was hired to write the special &quot;dual boot mode&quot; BIOS and the special CP/M BIOS. The &quot;dual boot mode&quot; BIOS actually discovered whether a TRS-DOS, or Aster CP/M disk was placed in the drive, and would, depending on the type of disk, reorganise the internal memory architecture of the system, to either be 100% TRS-80 compatible or optimally support CP/M, with as much &quot;workspace&quot; as possible, and the 80×25 video mode. It also was responsible for switching to ROM BASIC when the system was turned on with the break key pressed, and later supported a primitive LAN system, using the RS-232 port with modified cabling. The very first of the ready made computers were sold with the &quot;kit&quot; versions of the euro cards, the version with redesigned cards came a month or so later.

Soon the little shop became much too small and they moved to a much larger factory building nearby (formerly a window glass factory), and started mass-producing the Aster for a period of a few years, in which time its staff grew twentyfold.

After the Aster having been a few years on the Market Tandy released its own improved model, the TRS-80 Model III computer which solved many of the same problems that the Aster also had solved, but the model 3 still did not fully support CP/M as the Aster did. In the meantime IBM had released its original IBM PC, which incidentally looked remarkably like the Asters base with floppy drives + separate keyboard set-up.

The Aster was chosen for Dutch schools by the Dutch ministry of education, in a set-up with eight disk-less Asters, and one Aster with high-capacity floppy drives all connected by a LAN based on the Aster&#x27;s high-speed serial port hardware, and special cables that permitted that any single computer on the LAN could broadcast to all other computers. The floppy based system was operated by the teacher who could send programs from his floppy disk, and data, to the student&#x27;s disk-less systems thanks to the special BIOS in those systems. The students could send programs and data back to the teacher through the same LAN, or could save to a cassette recorder built into the disk-less units. Through a special &quot;video-switch&quot; the teacher was also able to see a copy of each student&#x27;s display on his own screen. About a thousand of such systems were sold for many hundreds of Dutch schools.

Because of cash flow problems (resulting from growing too fast, insufficient financial backing, technical problems, and a sudden problem with Z80 processor deliveries) the company suddenly folded even before it came to full fruition.

Perhaps the Aster computer inspired another Dutch computer firm to name their computer after another typical Dutch flower—the Tulip&#x27;s Tulip System-1 which appeared about the same time Aster folded.

Most of the engineers who designed the hardware and software of the Aster went on to design hardware and software for the (then new) MSX system for a company called &quot;Micro Technology b.v.&quot;.

==Unreleased add ons==
To enhance and modernize the Aster CT-80 the company also designed three alternative video display adapters to supplement or replace the TRS-80 compatible video card, (due to the modular nature of the Aster it was simply a matter of changing the video card, and/or CPU card to upgrade the system):
* A very High resolution monochrome video card with blitter and hardware text line and arc drawing capability, was designed for CAD applications, based on the NEC μPD7220 chip designed for graphic terminals, but was also used by some personal computers like the DEC Rainbow, and notably also for the Tulip System I.
* A colour video card with sprite capability based on the same TMS9918 video chip as the TI-99/4 and MSX computers, designed for gaming, and more creative and colorful educational software. A working prototype of this card was finished.
* A replacement card for the original TRS-80 compatible video card, software compatible to the original one, but with added color and very high resolution capabilities. was also on the drawing board. Based on a newer, slightly more flexible, version of the Asters original Motorola MC6845 video chip, the Rockwell 6545, it worked by adding a new video mode, one with the ability to reprogram an extended, (2048 characters instead of 256 characters) version of the character set, supported by an extended character memory of the video card that did not use one (8 bit) byte per character, but an 11 bit &quot;word&quot;, so it could address each one of the available 2048 unique programmable characters. This meant it could provide a separate programmable character for all of the 1024 (64x16) or 2000 (80x25) characters on the screen. By filling the character pointer memory with values from zero to 1999 this essentially turned the text mode display into a very high resolution graphics mode, with the &quot;font memory&quot;, acting as the high resolution Raster graphics video memory. Because the characters were 8 x 12 pixels this meant that video resolutions of 512 x 192 pixels (in 64x16 character mode), or 640 x 300 pixels (in 80x25 character mode) were created, which was quite high for the time. The &quot;double width&quot; mode of the TRS-80 was also supported, so 256 x 192 pixels (in 32x16 character mode), or 320 x 300 pixels (in 40x25 character mode) were also possible. The video card also supported 16 foreground and 16 background colors per character, by providing one byte per character position (2K) of &quot;color ram&quot;. One nibble of such a byte then controlled the foreground color, and the other nibble controlled the background color, a system very similar to the ZX Spectrum, in fact in the 256x192 mode the display mode was virtually identical to the video of the ZX Spectrum. The color memory was also available in the &quot;normal&quot; TRS-80 and CP/M text modes, which meant that existing TRS-80 and CP/M software could be easily modified to add color. This video card would also support fast scrolling of high resolution color screens for games, because it had the indirection of the character pointers, so it was possible to quickly scroll the high resolution display, (or use other effects) by simply manipulating the 1920/1024 bytes of text video instead of the 24,576 bytes of high-resolution video memory.

A hard disk interface was also in the works, which would, add a SCSI interface, and the necessary software. A working prototype was developed that added a 40MB hard disk.

On the software front, work was being done to implement the replacement for the aging &quot;user interface&quot; of CP/M, (the Command Console Processor CCP) with the more modern ZCPR.

Finally a replacement for the aging Z80 processor was being developed in the form of an Intel 8086 board, and additional 512K 16 bit memory boards. Such replacements of CPU and memory system components were possible because the Aster CT-80 was designed to use a backplane that was designed to support both 8 and 16 bit processors, and used a modular Eurocard based design with slots to spare for expansion. In theory the system could support the Z80 and the 8086 simultaneously. Plans were formulated to support CP/M-86 and even MS-DOS.

None of these extensions to the system became available because the company folded before any of them could be released.

<doc id="2140" wikidata="Q461595" url="?curid=2140" title="Atlanta Braves">
<text>The Atlanta Braves are an American professional baseball team based in the Atlanta metropolitan area. The Braves compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) East Division. The club was founded in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1871 as the Boston Red Stockings. The Braves are one of two remaining National League charter franchises that debuted in 1876 and are the oldest continuously operating professional sports franchise in North America. The franchise was known by various names until it adopted the Boston Braves name in 1912.

After 81 seasons and one World Series title in Boston, the club moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1953. With a roster of star players such as Hank Aaron, Eddie Mathews, and Warren Spahn, the Milwaukee Braves won the World Series in 1957. Despite the team&#x27;s success, fan attendance declined. The club&#x27;s owners moved the team to Atlanta, Georgia, in 1966.

The Braves did not find much success in Atlanta until 1991. From 1991 to 2005, the Braves were one of the most successful teams in baseball, winning an unprecedented 14 consecutive division titles, making an MLB record eight consecutive National League Championship Series appearances, and producing one of the greatest pitching rotations in the history of baseball including Hall of Famers Greg Maddux, John Smoltz, and Tom Glavine.

The club has won an MLB record 23 divisional titles, 18 National League pennants, and four World Series championships. The Braves are the only Major League Baseball franchise to have won the World Series in three different home cities. At the end of the 2024 season, the Braves&#x27; overall win–loss record is (). Since moving to Atlanta in 1966, the Braves have an overall win–loss record of () through the end of 2024.

==History==
===Boston (1871–1952)===
====1871–1913====
The Cincinnati Red Stockings, formed in 1869, were the first openly all-professional baseball team but disbanded after the 1870 season. Manager Harry Wright and players moved to Boston, forming the &quot;Boston Red Stockings&quot;, a charter team in the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NAPBBP). Led by the Wright brothers, Ross Barnes, and Al Spalding, they dominated the National Association, winning four of five championships. The original Boston Red Stockings team and its successors can lay claim to being the oldest continuously playing franchise in American professional sports.

The club was known as the Boston Red Caps when they played the first National League game in 1876, winning against the Philadelphia Athletics. Despite a weaker roster in the league&#x27;s first year, they rebounded to secure the 1877 and 1878 pennants. Managed by Frank Selee, they were a dominant force in the 19th century, winning eight pennants. By 1898, the team was known as the Beaneaters and they won 102 games that season, with stars like Hugh Duffy, Tommy McCarthy, and &quot;Slidin&#x27;&quot; Billy Hamilton.

In 1901, the American League was introduced, causing many Beaneaters players including stars Duffy and Jimmy Collins to leave for clubs of the rival league. The team struggled, having only one winning season from 1900 to 1913. In 1907, they temporarily dropped the red color from their stockings due to infection concerns.

The club underwent various nickname changes until becoming the Braves before the 1912 season. The president of the club, John M. Ward named the club after the owner, James Gaffney. Gaffney was called one of the &quot;braves&quot; of New York City&#x27;s political machine, Tammany Hall, which used a Native American chief as their symbol.

====1914: Miracle====

In 1914, the Boston Braves experienced a remarkable turnaround in what would become one of the most memorable seasons in baseball history. Starting with a dismal 4–18 record, the Braves found themselves in last place, trailing the league-leading New York Giants by 15 games after losing a doubleheader to the Brooklyn Robins on July 4. However, the team rebounded with an incredible hot streak, going 41–12 from July 6 to September 5. On August 3, Joseph Lannin the president of the Red Sox, offered Fenway Park to the Braves free of charge for the remainder of the season since their usual home, the South End Grounds, was too small. On September 7 and 8, they defeated the Giants in two out of three games, propelling them into first place. Despite being in last place as late as July 18, the Braves secured the pennant, becoming the only team under the old eight-team league format to achieve this after being in last place on the Fourth of July. They were in last place as late as July 18, but were close to the pack, moving into fourth on July 21 and second place on August 12.

The Braves entered the 1914 World Series led by captain and National League Most Valuable Player, Johnny Evers. The Boston club were slight underdogs against Connie Mack&#x27;s Philadelphia A&#x27;s. However, they swept the Athletics and won the world championship. Inspired by their success, owner Gaffney constructed a modern park, Braves Field, which opened in August 1915 and was the largest park in the majors at the time, boasting 40,000 seats and convenient public transportation access.

====1915–1952====

From 1917 to 1933, the Boston Braves struggled. After a series of different owners, Emil Fuchs bought the team in 1923. Fuchs brought his longtime friend, pitching great Christy Mathewson, as part of the syndicate that bought the club. However, the death of pitching legend in 1925 left Fuchs in control. Despite Fuchs&#x27; commitment to success, the team faced challenges overcoming the damage from previous years. It wasn&#x27;t until 1933 and 1934, under manager Bill McKechnie, that the Braves became competitive, but it did little to help the club&#x27;s finances.

In an effort to boost fan attendance and finances, Fuchs orchestrated a deal with the New York Yankees to acquire Babe Ruth in 1935. Ruth was appointed team vice president with promises of profit shares and managerial prospects. Initially, Ruth seemed to provide a spark on opening day, but his declining skills became evident. Ruth&#x27;s inability to run and poor fielding led to internal strife, and it became clear that his titles were symbolic. Ruth retired on June 1, 1935, shortly after hitting his last three home runs. The Braves finished the season with a dismal 38–115 record, marking the franchise&#x27;s worst season.

Fuchs lost control of the team in August 1935, leading to a rebranding attempt as the Boston Bees, but it did little to alter the team&#x27;s fortune. Construction magnate Lou Perini took over, eventually restoring the Braves&#x27; name. Despite World War II causing a brief setback, the team, led by pitcher Warren Spahn, enjoyed impressive seasons in 1946 and 1947 under Perini&#x27;s ownership.
In 1948, the team won the pennant, behind the pitching of Spahn and Johnny Sain. The remainder of the rotation was so thin that in September, &quot;Boston Post&quot; writer Gerald Hern wrote this poem about the pair:

:&quot;First we&#x27;ll use Spahn&quot;
:&quot;then we&#x27;ll use Sain&quot;
:&quot;Then an off day&quot;
:&quot;followed by rain&quot;
:&quot;Back will come Spahn&quot;
:&quot;followed by Sain&quot;
:&quot;And followed&quot;
:&quot;we hope&quot;
:&quot;by two days of rain.&quot;

The poem received such a wide audience that the sentiment, usually now paraphrased as &quot;Spahn and Sain and pray for rain&quot;, entered the baseball vocabulary.

The 1948 World Series, which the Braves lost in six games to the Indians, turned out to be the Braves&#x27; last hurrah in Boston. On March 13, 1953, Perini announced he was moving the club to Milwaukee. Perini cited advent of television and the lack of enthusiasm for the Braves in Boston as the key factors in deciding to move the franchise.

===Milwaukee (1953–1965)===

The Milwaukee Braves&#x27; move to Wisconsin for the 1953 season was an immediate success, as they drew a National League-record 1.8 million fans and finished the season second in the league. Manager Charlie Grimm was named NL Manager of the Year.

Throughout the 1950s, the Braves were a National League power; driven by sluggers Eddie Mathews and Hank Aaron, the team won two pennants and finished second twice between 1956 and 1959. In 1957, Aaron&#x27;s MVP season led the Braves to their first pennant in nine years, then a World Series victory against the formidable New York Yankees. Despite a strong start in the World Series rematch the following season, the Braves ultimately lost the last three games and the World Series. The 1959 season ended in a tie with the Los Angeles Dodgers, who defeated the Braves in a playoff. The ensuing years saw fluctuating success, including the Braves finishing fifth in 1963, their first time in the &quot;second division&quot;.

In 1962, team owner Louis Perini sold the Braves to a Chicago-based group led by William Bartholomay. Bartholomay intended to move the team to Atlanta in 1965, but legal hurdles kept them in Milwaukee for an extra season.

===Atlanta (1966–present)===

====1966–1974====

After arriving in Atlanta in 1966, the Braves found success in 1969, with the onset of divisional play by winning the first National League West Division title. In the National League Championship Series the Braves were swept by the &quot;Miracle Mets&quot;. They would post only two winning seasons between 1970 and 1981. Fans in Atlanta had to be satisfied with the achievements of Hank Aaron, who by the end of the 1973 season, had hit 713 home runs, one short of Ruth&#x27;s record. On April 4, opening day of the next season, he hit No. 714 in Cincinnati, and on April 8, in front of his home fans and a national television audience, he finally beat Ruth&#x27;s mark with a home run to left-center field off left-hander Al Downing of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Aaron spent most of his career as a Milwaukee and Atlanta Brave before being traded to the Milwaukee Brewers on November 2, 1974.

====Ted Turner and Time Warner era====

=====1976–1977: Ted Turner buys the team=====
In 1976, the team was purchased by media magnate Ted Turner, owner of superstation WTBS, as a means to keep the team (and one of his main programming staples) in Atlanta. Turner used the Braves as a major programming draw for his fledgling cable network, making the Braves the first franchise to have a nationwide audience and fan base. WTBS marketed the team as &quot;The Atlanta Braves: America&#x27;s Team&quot;, a nickname that still sticks in some areas of the country, especially the South. The financially strapped Turner used money already paid to the team for their broadcast rights as a down-payment. Turner quickly gained a reputation as a quirky, hands-on baseball owner. On May 11, 1977, Turner appointed himself manager, but because MLB passed a rule in the 1950s barring managers from holding a financial stake in their teams, Turner was ordered to relinquish that position after one game (the Braves lost 2–1 to the Pittsburgh Pirates to bring their losing streak to 17 games).

=====1978–1990=====
The Braves didn&#x27;t enjoy much success between 1978 and 1990, however, in the 1982 season, led by manager Joe Torre, the Braves secured their first divisional title since 1969. The team was led by standout performances from key players like Dale Murphy, Bob Horner, Chris Chambliss, Phil Niekro, and Gene Garber. The Braves were swept in the NLCS in three games by the Cardinals. Murphy won the Most Valuable Player award for the National League in 1982 and 1983.

=====1991–2005: 14 consecutive division titles=====
From 1991 to 2005, the Atlanta Braves enjoyed a remarkable era of success in baseball, marked by a record-setting 14 consecutive division titles, five National League pennants, and a World Series championship in 1995. Bobby Cox returned as manager in 1990, leading the team&#x27;s turnaround after finishing the previous season with the worst record in baseball. Notable developments included the drafting of Chipper Jones in 1990 and the hiring of general manager John Schuerholz from the Kansas City Royals.

The Braves&#x27; remarkable journey began in 1991, known as the &quot;Worst to First&quot; season. Overcoming a shaky start, the Braves bounced back led by young pitchers Tom Glavine and John Smoltz. The team secured the NL pennant in a memorable playoff race, ultimately losing a closely contested World Series to the Minnesota Twins. The following year, the Braves won the NLCS in dramatic fashion against the Pirates but fell short in the World Series against the Toronto Blue Jays.

In 1993, the Braves strengthened their pitching staff with the addition of Cy Young Award winner Greg Maddux in free agency. Despite posting a franchise-best 104 wins, they lost in the NLCS to the Philadelphia Phillies. The team moved to the Eastern Division in 1994, sparking a heated rivalry with the New York Mets.

The player&#x27;s strike cut short the 1994 season just before the division championships, but the Braves rebounded in 1995, defeating the Cleveland Indians to win the World Series. With this World Series victory, the Braves became the first team in Major League Baseball to win world championships in three different cities. The Braves reached the World Series in 1996 and 1999 but were defeated both times by the New York Yankees.

In 1996, Time Warner acquired Ted Turner&#x27;s Turner Broadcasting System, including the Braves. Despite their continued success with a ninth consecutive division title in 2000, the Braves faced postseason disappointment with a sweep by the St. Louis Cardinals in the NLDS. The team won division titles from 2002 to 2004 but experienced early exits in the NLDS each year.

====Liberty Media era====

=====Liberty Media buys the team=====

In December 2005, Time Warner, put the club up for sale, leading to negotiations with Liberty Media. After over a year of talks, a deal was reached in February 2007 for Liberty Media to acquire the Braves for $450 million, a magazine publishing company, and $980 million in cash. The sale, valued at approximately $1.48 billion, was contingent on approval from 75 percent of MLB owners and Commissioner Bud Selig.

===== Bobby Cox and Chipper Jones retire =====
Bobby Cox&#x27;s final year as manager in 2010 saw the Braves return to the postseason for the first time since 2005. The team secured the NL Wild Card but fell to the San Francisco Giants in the National League Division Series in four closely contested games, marking the conclusion of Bobby Cox&#x27;s managerial career. The following season the Braves suffered a historic September collapse to miss the postseason. The club bounced back in 2012 and returned to the postseason in Chipper Jones&#x27; final season. The Braves won 94 games in 2012, but that wasn&#x27;t enough to win the NL East, so they faced the St. Louis Cardinals in the inaugural Wild Card Game. Chipper Jones last game was a memorable one: the Braves lost the one game playoff 6–3, but the game would be remembered for a controversial infield fly call that helped end a Braves rally in the 8th inning.

=====Truist Park and return to the World Series=====
In 2017, the Atlanta Braves began playing at Truist Park, replacing Turner Field as their home stadium. Following an MLB investigation into international signing rule violations, general manager John Coppolella resigned and faced a baseball ban. Alex Anthopoulos took over as the new general manager. The team&#x27;s chairman, Terry McGuirk, apologized for the scandal and expressed confidence in Anthopoulos&#x27; integrity. A new on field mascot named Blooper was introduced at a fan event before the 2017 season. Under Anthopoulos, the Braves made the playoffs in six of his first seven seasons. In 2020 the Braves reached the National League Championship Series, but ultimately lost to the Dodgers after leading 3–1.
In the 2021 season, the Braves won the National League East with an 88–73 record. In the postseason, they quickly defeated the Milwaukee Brewers in the NL Division Series 3–1. The Braves again faced the Dodgers in the 2021 NLCS, and won in six games to take Atlanta&#x27;s first National League pennant since 1999. The Braves advanced to the World Series. They defeated the Houston Astros in six games to win their fourth World Series title.

===Logos and uniforms ===
The Braves logos have evolved over the years, featuring a Native American warrior from 1945 to 1955, followed by a laughing Native American with a mohawk and a feather from 1956 to 1965. The modern logo, introduced in 1987, includes the cursive word &quot;Braves&quot; with a tomahawk below it.
Uniform changes occurred in 1987, with the team adopting uniforms reminiscent of their 1950s classic look. For the 2023 season, the Braves had four uniform combinations, including the classic white home and gray road uniforms, a navy blue road jersey for alternate games, and two alternate uniforms for home games - a Friday night red uniform and a City Connect uniform worn on Saturdays, paying tribute to Hank Aaron. The City Connect uniform features &quot;The A&quot; across the chest, accompanied by a cap with the &quot;A&quot; logo and 1974 uniform colors.

==World Series championships==
Over the 120 years since the inception of the World Series (119 total World Series played), the Braves franchise has won a total of four World Series Championships. The Braves are the only franchise to have won a World Series in three different cities.

==Ballparks==

===Former parks===

The Boston Braves played at the South End Grounds from their inception. After a fire destroyed the park in 1894, the club temporarily played at the Congress Street Grounds until the South End Grounds could be rebuilt. During the 1914 season, it became evident that the South End Grounds was too small to accommodate larger crowds, prompting the team to play some games at Fenway Park. To address the need for a larger venue, Braves Field was built in 1915.

Braves Field remained the club&#x27;s home in Boston until the team relocated to Milwaukee. Milwaukee County Stadium was constructed in 1950 to attract a Major League Baseball team and became the Braves&#x27; new home in 1953. The team played there until moving to Atlanta in 1966.

The city of Atlanta constructed Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium in 1965 after reaching an agreement with the Braves to relocate from Milwaukee. The Braves played at Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium until 1997, when they moved to Turner Field. Originally built as Centennial Olympic Stadium for the 1996 Summer Olympics, the venue was later converted into a ballpark for the Braves. Turner Field served as the Braves&#x27; home ballpark through the 2016 season.

===Current parks===

====Truist Park====

The Atlanta Braves home ballpark has been Truist Park since 2017. Truist Park is located approximately 10 miles (16 km) northwest of downtown Atlanta in the unincorporated community of Cumberland, in Cobb County, Georgia. The Braves opened Truist Park on April 14, 2017, with a four-game sweep of the San Diego Padres. The park received positive reviews. Woody Studenmund of the Hardball Times called the park a &quot;gem&quot; saying that he was impressed with &quot;the compact beauty of the stadium and its exciting approach to combining baseball, business and social activities.&quot; J.J. Cooper of Baseball America praised the &quot;excellent sight lines for pretty much every seat.&quot;

====CoolToday Park====

Since 2019, the Braves have played spring training games at CoolToday Park in North Port, Florida. The ballpark opened on March 24, 2019, with the Braves&#x27; 4–2 win over the Tampa Bay Rays. The Braves left Champion Stadium, their previous Spring Training home near Orlando to reduce travel times and to get closer to other teams&#x27; facilities. CoolToday Park also serves as the Braves&#x27; year round rehabilitation facility.

===Attendance===

(*) – There were no fans allowed in any MLB stadium in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Major rivalry==

===New York Mets===
Although their first major confrontation occurred when the Mets swept the Braves in the 1969 NLCS, the rivalry did not become especially heated until the 1994 season when division realignment put both the Mets and the Braves in the National League East division.

The Braves faced the Mets in the 1999 National League Championship Series. The Braves initially took a 3–0 series lead, seemingly on the verge of a sweep, but the Mets rallied in Game 4 and Game 5. Despite the Mets&#x27; resilience, the Braves eventually won the series in Game 6 with Andruw Jones securing a dramatic walk-off walk, earning their 5th National League pennant of the decade. In 2022, the Braves and Mets, both finished with 101 wins. The National League East title and a first-round bye came down to a crucial three-game series at Truist Park from September 30 to October 2. The Mets entered with a slight lead but faltered as the Braves swept the series. Atlanta claimed the NL East division title and first-round bye, by winning the season series against the Mets.

Since the Mets joined the league, both teams have won two World Series titles. The Braves have captured six NL pennants, while the Mets have won five. The Braves hold the advantage in the all-time head-to-head record between the two teams at 516–425. However, the Mets have the upper hand in playoff matchups with a 5–4 record.

==Nationwide fanbase==
In addition to having strong fan support in the Metro Atlanta area and the state of Georgia, the Braves are often referred to as &quot;America&#x27;s Team&quot; in reference to the team&#x27;s games being broadcast nationally on TBS from the 1970s until 2007, giving the team a nationwide fan base.

The Braves boast heavy support within the Southeastern United States particularly in states such as Mississippi, Alabama, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee and Florida.

==Tomahawk chop==

In 1991, fans of the Atlanta Braves popularized the &quot;tomahawk chop&quot; during games. The use of foam tomahawks faced criticism from Native American groups, who regarded it as demeaning. Despite protests, the Braves&#x27; public relations director defended it as a &quot;proud expression of unification and family.&quot; The controversy resurfaced in 2019 when Cherokee Nation member and St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Ryan Helsley found the chop insulting, prompting the Braves to modify their in-game experience. During the off-season, discussions ensued with Native American representatives, and amid pressure in 2020 to change their name, the Braves announced ongoing talks about the chop but insisted the team name would remain unchanged.

The debate over the tomahawk chop continued into 2021. While some Native American leaders, like Richard Sneed, the Principal Chief of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, expressed personal indifference or tolerance, acknowledging it as an acknowledgment of Native American strength, others vehemently opposed it. Sneed emphasized larger issues facing Native American communities and questioned the focus on the chop. The Eastern Cherokee Band of Indians and the Braves initiated efforts to incorporate Cherokee language and culture into the team&#x27;s activities, stadium, and merchandise, aiming for greater cultural sensitivity despite differing opinions within the Native American community.

==Achievements==

===Awards===
Braves players have won seven Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards, with Dale Murphy notably earning the honor in back-to-back years, 1982 and 1983. Five Braves pitchers have received the Cy Young Award, given to the league&#x27;s best pitcher, including Greg Maddux, who won it three consecutive times in 1993, 1994, and 1995.

Two Braves managers have been named Manager of the Year, with Bobby Cox winning the award three times, in 1991, 2004, and 2005. Additionally, seven Braves players have been honored with the Rookie of the Year awards.

===Team records===
===Retired numbers===
The Braves have retired eleven numbers in the history of the franchise. Most recently, Andruw Jones&#x27; number 25 was retired in 2023. Other retired numbers include Chipper Jones&#x27; number 10, John Smoltz&#x27;s number 29, Bobby Cox&#x27;s number 6, Tom Glavine&#x27;s number 47, and Greg Maddux&#x27;s number 31. Additionally, the Braves have retired Hank Aaron&#x27;s number 44, Dale Murphy&#x27;s number 3, Phil Niekro&#x27;s number 35, Eddie Mathews&#x27; number 41, and Warren Spahn&#x27;s number 21. Jackie Robinson&#x27;s number 42 is also retired across all of Major League Baseball, with the exception of Jackie Robinson Day.

Six of the eleven numbers (Cox, Jones, Jones, Smoltz, Maddux and Glavine) were on the Braves at the same time. Of the eleven Braves whose numbers have been retired, all who are eligible for the National Baseball Hall of Fame have been elected with the exceptions of Dale Murphy and Andruw Jones. The color and design of the retired numbers on commemorative markers and other in-stadium signage reflect the primary uniform design at the time the player was on the team.

<text>Atari ST is a line of personal computers from Atari Corporation and the successor to the company&#x27;s 8-bit home computers. The initial model, the Atari 520ST, had limited release in April–June 1985, and was widely available in July. It was the first personal computer with a bitmapped color graphical user interface, using a version of Digital Research&#x27;s GEM environment from February 1985. The Atari 1040ST, released in 1986 with 1 MB of memory, was the first home computer with a cost per kilobyte of RAM under US$1/KB.

After Jack Tramiel purchased the assets of the Atari, Inc. consumer division in 1984 to create Atari Corporation, the 520ST was designed in five months by a small team led by Shiraz Shivji. Alongside the Macintosh, Amiga, Apple IIGS and Acorn Archimedes, the ST is part of a mid-1980s generation of computers with 16 or 16/32-bit processors, 256 KB or more of RAM, and mouse-controlled graphical user interfaces. &quot;ST&quot; officially stands for &quot;Sixteen/Thirty-two&quot;, referring to the Motorola 68000&#x27;s 16-bit external bus and 32-bit internals.

The ST was sold with either Atari&#x27;s color monitor or less expensive monochrome monitor. Color graphics modes are available only on the former while the highest-resolution mode requires the monochrome monitor. Some models can display the color modes on a TV. In Germany and some other markets, the ST gained a foothold for CAD and desktop publishing. With built-in MIDI ports, it was popular for music sequencing and as a controller of musical instruments among amateur and professional musicians. The Atari ST&#x27;s primary competitor was the Amiga from Commodore. 

The 520ST and 1040ST were followed by the Mega series, the STE, and the portable STacy. In the early 1990s, Atari released three final evolutions of the ST with significant technical differences from the original models: TT030 (1990), Mega STE (1991), and Falcon (1992). Atari discontinued the entire ST computer line in 1993, shifting the company&#x27;s focus to the Jaguar video game console.

== Development ==
The Atari ST was born from the rivalry between home computer makers Atari, Inc. and Commodore International. Jay Miner, one of the designers of the custom chips in the Atari 2600 and Atari 8-bit computers, tried to convince Atari management to create a new chipset for a video game console and computer. When his idea was rejected, he left Atari to form a small think tank called Hi-Toro in 1982 and began designing the new &quot;Lorraine&quot; chipset.

Hi-Toro, by then renamed Amiga, ran out of capital to complete Lorraine&#x27;s development, and Atari, now owned by Warner Communications, paid Amiga to continue its work. In return, Atari received exclusive use of the Lorraine design for one year as a video game console. After that time, Atari had the right to add a keyboard and market the complete computer, designated the 1850XLD.

=== Tramel Technology ===
After leaving Commodore International in January 1984, Jack Tramiel formed Tramel (without an &quot;i&quot;) Technology, Ltd. with his sons and other ex-Commodore employees and, in April, began planning a new computer. Interested in Atari&#x27;s overseas manufacturing and worldwide distribution network, Tramiel negotiated with Warner in May and June 1984. He secured funding and bought Atari&#x27;s consumer division, which included the console and home computer departments, in July. As executives and engineers left Commodore to join Tramel Technology, Commodore responded by filing lawsuits against four former engineers for infringement of trade secrets. The Tramiels did not purchase the employee contracts with the assets of Atari, Inc. and re-hired approximately 100 of the 900 former employees. Tramel Technology soon changed its name to Atari Corporation.

=== Commodore and Amiga ===
Amid rumors that Tramiel was negotiating to buy Atari, Amiga Corp. entered discussions with Commodore. This led to Commodore wanting to purchase Amiga Corporation outright, which Commodore believed would cancel any outstanding contracts, including Atari&#x27;s. Instead of Amiga Corp. delivering Lorraine to Atari, Commodore delivered a check of $500,000 on Amiga&#x27;s behalf, in effect returning the funds Atari invested in Amiga for the chipset. Tramiel countered by suing Amiga Corp. on August 13, 1984, seeking damages and an injunction to bar Amiga (and effectively Commodore) from producing anything with its technology.

The lawsuit left the Amiga team in limbo during mid-1984. Commodore eventually moved forward, with plans to improve the chipset and develop an operating system. Commodore announced the Amiga 1000 with the Lorraine chipset in July 1985, but it wasn&#x27;t available in quantity until 1986. The delay gave Atari time to deliver the Atari 520ST in June 1985. In March 1987, the two companies settled the dispute out of court in a closed decision.

=== ST hardware ===
The lead architect of the new computer project at Tramel Technology and Atari Corporation was ex-Commodore employee Shiraz Shivji, who previously worked on the Commodore 64&#x27;s development. Different CPUs were investigated, including the 32-bit National Semiconductor NS32000, but engineers were disappointed with its performance, and they moved to the Motorola 68000. The Atari ST design was completed in five months in 1984, concluding with it being shown at the January 1985 Consumer Electronics Show.

A custom sound processor called AMY had been in development at Atari, Inc. and was considered for the new ST computer design. The chip needed more time to complete, so AMY was dropped in favor of a commodity Yamaha YM2149F variant of the General Instrument AY-3-8910.

=== Operating system ===
Soon after the Atari buyout, Microsoft suggested to Tramiel that it could port Windows to the platform, but the delivery date was out by two years. Another possibility was Digital Research, which was working on a new GUI-based system then known as Crystal, soon to become GEM. Another option was to write a new operating system, but this was rejected as Atari management was unsure whether the company had the required expertise.

Digital Research was fully committed to the Intel platform, so a team from Atari was sent to the Digital Research headquarters to work with the &quot;Monterey Team&quot;, which comprised a mixture of Atari and Digital Research engineers. Atari&#x27;s Leonard Tramiel oversaw &quot;Project Jason&quot; (also known as The Operating System) for the ST series, named for designer and developer Jason Loveman.

GEM is based on CP/M-68K, a direct port of CP/M to the 68000. By 1985, CP/M was becoming increasingly outdated; it did not support subdirectories, for example. Digital Research was also in the process of building GEMDOS, a disk operating system for GEM, and debated whether a port of it could be completed in time for product delivery in June. The decision was eventually taken to port it, resulting in a GEMDOS file system which became part of Atari TOS (for &quot;The Operating System&quot;, colloquially known as the &quot;Tramiel Operating System&quot;). This gave the ST a fast, hierarchical file system, essential for hard drives, and provided programmers with function calls similar to MS-DOS. The Atari ST character set is based on codepage 437.

== Release ==
After six months of intensive effort following Tramiel&#x27;s takeover, Atari announced the 520ST at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January 1985. &quot;InfoWorld&quot; assessed the prototypes shown at computer shows as follows:Pilot production models of the Atari machine are much slicker than the hand-built models shown at earlier computer fairs; it doesn&#x27;t look like a typical Commodore 64-style, corner-cutting, low-cost Jack Tramiel product of the past.Atari unexpectedly displayed the ST at Atlanta COMDEX in May. Similarities to the original Macintosh and Tramiel&#x27;s role in its development resulted in it being nicknamed Jackintosh. Atari&#x27;s rapid development of the ST amazed many, but others were skeptical, citing its &quot;cheap&quot; appearance, Atari&#x27;s uncertain financial health, and poor relations between Tramiel-led Commodore and software developers.

Atari ST print advertisements stated, &quot;America, We Built It For You&quot;, and quoted Atari president Sam Tramiel: &quot;We promised. We delivered. With pride, determination, and good old ATARI know how&quot;. But Jack Tramiel admitted that sales of its earlier 8-bit systems were &quot;very, very slow&quot;, Atari was out of cash, and employees feared that he would shut the company down.

In early 1985, the 520ST shipped to the press, developers, and user groups, and in early July 1985 for general retail sales. It saved the company. By November, Atari stated that more than 50,000 520STs had been sold, &quot;with U.S. sales alone well into five figures&quot;. The machine had gone from concept to store shelves in a little under one year.

Atari had intended to release the 130ST with 128 KB of RAM and the 260ST with 256 KB. However, the ST initially shipped without TOS in ROM and required booting TOS from floppy, taking 206 KB RAM away from applications. The 260ST was launched in Europe on a limited basis. Early models have six ROM sockets for easy upgrades to TOS. New ROMs were released a few months later and were included in new machines and as an upgrade for older machines.

Atari originally intended to include GEM&#x27;s Graphical Device Operating System (GDOS), which allows programs to send GEM VDI (Virtual Device Interface) commands to drivers loaded by GDOS. This allows developers to send VDI instructions to other devices simply by pointing to it. However, GDOS was not ready at the time the ST started shipping and was included in software packages and with later ST machines. Later versions of GDOS support vector fonts.

A limited set of GEM fonts were included in the ROMs, including the ST&#x27;s standard 8x8 pixel graphical character set. It contains four characters which can be placed together in a square, forming the face of J. R. &quot;Bob&quot; Dobbs (the figurehead of the Church of the SubGenius).

The ST was less expensive than most contemporaries, including the Macintosh Plus, and is faster than many. Largely as a result of its price and performance factor, the ST became fairly popular, especially in Europe where foreign-exchange rates amplified prices. The company&#x27;s English advertising slogan of the era was &quot;Power Without the Price&quot;. An Atari ST and terminal emulation software was much cheaper than a Digital VT220 terminal, commonly needed by offices with central computers.

By late 1985, the 520STM added an RF modulator for TV display.

=== Industry reaction ===
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; stated that Tramiel&#x27;s poor pre-Atari reputation would likely make computer stores reluctant to deal with the company, hurting its distribution of the ST. One retailer said, &quot;If you can believe Lucy when she holds the football for Charlie Brown, you can believe Jack Tramiel&quot;; another said that because of its experience with Tramiel, &quot;our interest in Atari is zero, zilch&quot;. Neither Atari nor Commodore could persuade large chains like ComputerLand or BusinessLand to sell its products. Observers criticized Atari&#x27;s erratic discussion of its stated plans for the new computer, as it shifted between using mass merchandisers, specialty computer stores, and both. When asked at COMDEX, Atari executives could not name any computer stores that would carry the ST. After a meeting with Atari, one analyst said, &quot;We&#x27;ve seen marketing strategies changed before our eyes&quot;.

Tramiel&#x27;s poor reputation influenced potential software developers. One said, &quot;Dealing with Commodore is like dealing with Attila the Hun. I don&#x27;t know if Tramiel will be following his old habits ... I don&#x27;t see a lot of people rushing to get software on the machine.&quot; Large business-software companies like Lotus, Ashton-Tate, and Microsoft did not promise software for either the ST or Amiga, and the majority of software companies were hesitant to support another platform beyond the IBM PC, Apple, and Commodore 64. Philippe Kahn of Borland said, &quot;These days, if I were a consumer, I&#x27;d stick with companies [such as Apple and IBM] I know will be around&quot;.

At Las Vegas COMDEX in November 1985, the industry was surprised by more than 30 companies exhibiting ST software while the Amiga had almost none. After Atlanta COMDEX, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;more than 100 software titles will be available for the [ST], most written by small software houses that desperately need work&quot;, and contrasted the &quot;small, little-known companies&quot; at Las Vegas with the larger ones like Electronic Arts and Activision, which planned Amiga applications.

Trip Hawkins of Electronic Arts said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think Atari understands the software business. I&#x27;m still skeptical about its resources and its credibility.&quot; Although Michael Berlyn of Infocom promised that his company would quickly publish all of its games for the new computer, he doubted many others would soon do so. Spinnaker and Lifetree were more positive, both promising to release ST software. Spinnaker said that &quot;Atari has a vastly improved attitude toward software developers. They are eager to give us technical support and machines&quot;. Lifetree said, &quot;We are giving Atari high priority&quot;. Some, such as Software Publishing Corporation, were unsure of whether to develop for the ST or the Amiga. John C. Dvorak wrote that the public saw both Commodore and Atari as selling &quot;cheap disposable&quot; game machines, in part because of their computers&#x27; sophisticated graphics.

== Design ==
The original 520ST case design was created by Ira Velinsky, Atari&#x27;s chief Industrial Designer. It is wedge-shaped, with bold angular lines and a series of grilles cut into the rear for airflow. The keyboard has soft tactile feedback and rhomboid-shaped function keys across the top. It is an all-in-one unit, similar to earlier home computers like the Commodore 64, but with a larger keyboard with cursor keys and a numeric keypad. The original has an external floppy drive (SF354) and AC adapter. Starting with the 1040ST, the floppy drive and power supply are integrated into the base unit.

=== Ports ===

The ports on the 520ST remained largely unchanged over its history.

* Centronics printer port (DB25 female, officially compliant only with the most basic unidirectional standard with a single, &quot;Busy&quot; input line; unofficially offering some bidirectional capabilities)
* Atari joystick ports (DE-9 male) for the mouse and game controllers
* 2 MIDI ports (5-pin DIN, &quot;IN&quot; and &quot;OUT&quot;)

Because of its bi-directional design, the Centronics printer port can be used for joystick input, and several games used available adaptors that used the printer socket, providing two additional 9-pin joystick ports.

==== ST-specific ====
* Monitor port (custom 13-pin DIN, 12 of the pins in a rectangular pattern, carrying signals for both RGB and monochrome monitors, monophonic audio and, in later models, composite video)
* ACSI (similar to SCSI) DMA port (custom-sized 19-pin D-sub, for hard disks and laser printers, capable of up to 2 MB/s with efficient programming)
* Floppy port (14-pin DIN, listed as operating at 250 kbit/s)
* ST cartridge port (double-sided 40-contact edge connector socket, for 128 KB ROM cartridges)

=== Monitor ===
The ST supports a monochrome or colour monitor. The colour hardware supports two resolutions: 320 × 200 pixels, with 16 of 512 colours; and 640 × 200, with 4 of 512 colours. The monochrome monitor was less expensive and has a single resolution of 640 × 400 at 71.25 Hz. The attached monitor determines available resolutions, so each application either supports both types of monitors or only one. Most ST games require colour with productivity software favouring the monochrome. The Philips CM8833-II was a popular color monitor for the Atari ST.

=== Floppy drive ===

Atari initially used single-sided 3.5 inch floppy disk drives that could store up to 360 KB. Later drives were double-sided and stored 720 KB. Some commercial software, particularly games, shipped by default on single-sided disks, even supplying two 360 KB floppies instead of a single double-sided one, to avoid alienating early adopters. 

Some software uses formats which allow the full disk to be read by double-sided drives but still lets single-sided drives access side A of the disk. Many magazine coverdisks (such as the first 30 issues of &quot;ST Format&quot;) were designed this way, as were a few games. The music in &quot;Carrier Command&quot; and the intro sequence in &quot;Populous&quot; are not accessible to single-sided drives, for example. 

STs with double-sided drives can read disks formatted by MS-DOS, but IBM PC compatibles can not read Atari disks because of differences in the layout of data on track 0.

== Later systems ==
=== 1040ST ===
Atari upgraded the basic design in 1986 with the 1040STF, stylized as 1040STF: essentially a 520ST with twice the RAM and with the power supply and a double-sided floppy drive with twice the capacity, and built-in instead of external. This adds to the size of the machine, but reduces cable clutter. The joystick and mouse ports, formerly on the right side of the machine, are in a recess underneath the keyboard. An &quot;FM&quot; variant includes an RF modulator allowing a television to be used instead of a monitor.

The trailing &quot;F&quot; and &quot;FM&quot; were often dropped in common usage. In &quot;BYTE&quot; magazine&#x27;s March 1986 cover photo of the system, the name plate reads 1040STFM but in the headline and article it&#x27;s simply &quot;1040ST&quot;. 
The 1040ST is one of the earliest personal computers shipped with a base RAM configuration of 1 MB. With a list price of in the US, &quot;BYTE&quot; hailed it as the first computer to break the $1000 per megabyte price barrier. &quot;Compute!&quot; noted that the 1040ST is the first computer with one megabyte of RAM to sell for less than $2,500.

A limited number of 1040STFs shipped with a single-sided floppy drive of 360KB storage capacity verses 720KB in the double sided version.

=== Mega ===
Initial sales were strong, especially in Europe, where Atari sold 75% of its computers. West Germany became Atari&#x27;s strongest market, with small business owners using them for desktop publishing and CAD.

To address this growing market segment, Atari introduced the ST1 at Comdex in 1986. Renamed to Mega, it includes a high-quality detached keyboard, a stronger case to support the weight of a monitor, and an internal bus expansion connector. An optional 20 MB hard drive can be placed below or above the main case. Initially equipped with 2 or 4 MB of RAM (a 1 MB version, the Mega 1, followed), the Mega machines can be combined with Atari&#x27;s laser printer for a low-cost desktop publishing package.

A custom blitter coprocessor improved some graphics performance, but was not included in all models. Developers wanting to use it had to detect its presence in their programs. Properly written applications using the GEM API automatically make use of the blitter.

=== STE ===
In late 1989, Atari Corporation released the 520STE and 1040STE (also written STE), enhanced version of the ST with improvements to the multimedia hardware and operating system. It features an increased color palette of 4,096 colors from the ST&#x27;s 512 (though the maximum displayable palette without programming tricks is still limited to 16 in the lowest 320 × 200 resolution, and even fewer in higher resolutions), genlock support, and a blitter coprocessor (stylized as &quot;BLiTTER&quot;) which can quickly move large blocks of data (particularly, graphics data) around in RAM. The STE is the first Atari with PCM audio; using a new chip, it added the ability to play back 8-bit (signed) samples at 6258 Hz, 12,517 Hz, 25,033 Hz, and even 50,066 Hz, via direct memory access (DMA). The channels are arranged as either a mono track or a track of LRLRLRLR... bytes. RAM is now much more simply upgradable via SIMMs.

Two enhanced joystick ports were added (two normal joysticks can be plugged into each port with an adapter), with the new connectors placed in more easily accessed locations on the side of the case. The enhanced joystick ports were re-used in the Atari Jaguar console and are compatible.

The STE models initially had software and hardware conflicts resulting in some applications and video games written for the ST line being unstable or even completely unusable, primarily caused by programming direct hardware calls which bypassed the operating system. Furthermore, even having a joystick plugged in would sometimes cause strange behavior with a few applications (such as the WYSIWYG word-processor application 1st Word Plus). Sleepwalker was the only STE-only game from a major publisher, but there were STe enhancements in games such as Another World, Zool and The Chaos Engine, as well as exclusives from smaller companies.

The last STE machine, the Mega STE, is an STE in a grey Atari TT case that had a switchable 16 MHz, dual-bus design (16-bit external, 32-bit internal), optional Motorola 68881 FPU, built-in 1.44 MB &quot;HD&quot; 3-inch floppy disk drive, VME expansion slot, a network port (very similar to that used by Apple&#x27;s LocalTalk) and an optional built-in 3&quot; hard drive. It also shipped with TOS 2.00 (better support for hard drives, enhanced desktop interface, memory test, 1.44 MB floppy support, bug fixes). It was marketed as more affordable than a TT but more powerful than an ordinary ST.

=== Atari TT ===

In 1990, Atari released the high-end workstation-oriented Atari TT030, based on a 32 MHz Motorola 68030 processor. The &quot;TT&quot; name (&quot;Thirty-two/Thirty-two&quot;) continued the nomenclature because the 68030 chip has 32-bit buses both internally and externally. Originally planned with a 68020 CPU, the TT has improved graphics and more powerful support chips. The case has a new design with an integrated hard-drive enclosure.

=== Falcon ===
The final model of ST computer is the Falcon030. Like the TT, it is 68030-based, at 16 MHz, but with improved video modes and an on-board Motorola 56001 audio digital signal processor. Like the Atari STE, it supports sampling frequencies above 44.1 kHz; the sampling master clock is 98340 Hz (which can be divided by a number between 2 and 16 to get the actual sampling frequencies). It can play the STE sample frequencies (up to 50066 Hz) in 8 or 16 bit, mono or stereo, all by using the same DMA interface as the STE, with a few additions. It can both play back and record samples, with 8 mono channels and 4 stereo channels, allowing musicians to use it for recording to hard drive. Although the 68030 microprocessor can use 32-bit memory, the Falcon uses a 16-bit bus, which reduces performance and cost. In another cost-reduction measure, Atari shipped the Falcon in an inexpensive case much like that of the STF and STE. Aftermarket upgrade kits allow it to be put in a desktop or rack-mount case, with the keyboard separate.

Released in 1992, the Falcon was discontinued by Atari the following year. In Europe, C-Lab licensed the Falcon design from Atari and released the C-Lab Falcon Mk I, identical to Atari&#x27;s Falcon except for slight modifications to the audio circuitry. The Mk II added an internal 500 MB SCSI hard disk; and the Mk X further added a desktop case. C-Lab Falcons were also imported to the US by some Atari dealers.

== Software ==
As with the Atari 8-bit computers, software publishers attributed their reluctance to produce Atari ST products in part to—as &quot;Compute!&quot; reported in 1988—the belief in the existence of a &quot;higher-than-normal amount of software piracy&quot;. That year, WordPerfect threatened to discontinue the Atari ST version of its word processor because the company discovered that pirate bulletin board systems (BBSs) were distributing it, causing &quot;ST-Log&quot; to warn that &quot;we had better put a stop to piracy &quot;now&quot; ... it can have harmful effects on the longevity and health of your computer&quot;. In 1989, magazines published a letter by Gilman Louie, head of Spectrum HoloByte. He stated that he had been warned by competitors that releasing a game like &quot;Falcon&quot; on the ST would fail because BBSs would widely disseminate it. Within 30 days of releasing the non-copy protected ST version, the game was available on BBSs with maps and code wheels. Because the ST market was smaller than that for the IBM PC, it was more vulnerable to piracy which, Louie said, seemed to be better organized and more widely accepted for the ST. He reported that the Amiga version sold in six weeks twice as much as the ST version in nine weeks, and that the Mac and PC versions had four times the sales. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; stated &quot;This is certainly the clearest exposition ... we have seen to date&quot; of why software companies produced less software for the ST than for other computers.

Several third-party OSes were developed for, or ported to, the Atari ST. Unix clones include Idris, Minix, and the MiNT OS which was developed specifically for the Atari ST.

===Audio===
Plenty of professional quality MIDI-related software was released. The popular Windows and Macintosh applications Cubase and Logic Pro originated on the Atari ST (the latter as Creator, Notator, Notator-SL, and Notator Logic). Another popular and powerful ST music sequencer application, KCS, contains a &quot;Multi-Program Environment&quot; that allows ST users to run other applications, such as the synthesizer patch editing software XoR (now known as Unisyn on the Macintosh), from within the sequencer application.

Music tracker software became popular on the ST, such as the TCB Tracker, aiding the production of quality music from the Yamaha synthesizer, now called chiptunes.

Due to the ST having comparatively large amounts of memory for the time, sound sampling packages became feasible. Replay Professional features a sound sampler using the ST cartridge port to read in parallel from the cartridge port from the ADC. For output of digital sound, it uses the on-board frequency output, sets it to 128 kHz (inaudible) and then modulates the amplitude of that.

MasterTracks Pro originated on Macintosh, then ST, then IBM PC version. It continued on Windows and macOS, along with the original company&#x27;s notation applications Encore.

===Applications===

Professional desktop publishing software includes Timeworks Publisher, PageStream and Calamus. Word processors include WordPerfect, Microsoft Write, AtariWorks, Signum, Script and First Word (bundled with the machine). Spreadsheets include 3D-Calc, and databases include Zoomracks. Graphics applications include NEOchrome, DEGAS &amp; DEGAS Elite, Deluxe Paint, STAD, and Cyber Paint (which author Jim Kent would later evolve into Autodesk Animator) with advanced features such as 3D design and animation. The Spectrum 512 paint program uses rapid palette switching to expand the on-screen color palette to 512 (up to 46 colors per scan line).

3D computer graphics applications (like Cyber Studio CAD-3D, which author Tom Hudson later developed into Autodesk 3D Studio), brought 3D modelling, sculpting, scripting, and computer animation to the desktop. Video capture and editing applications use dongles connected to the cartridge port for low frame rate, mainly silent and monochrome, but progressed to sound and basic color in still frames. At the end, Spectrum 512 and CAD-3D teamed up to produce realistic 512-color textured 3D renderings, but processing was slow, and Atari&#x27;s failure to deliver a machine with a math coprocessor had Hudson and Yost looking towards the PC as the future before a finished product could be delivered to the consumer.

Garry Kasparov became the first chess player to register a copy of ChessBase, a popular commercial database program for storing and searching records of chess games. The first version was built for Atari ST with his collaboration in January 1987. In his autobiography &quot;Child of Change&quot;, he regards this facility as &quot;the most important development in chess research since printing&quot;.

Graphical touchscreen point of sale software for restaurants was originally developed for Atari ST by Gene Mosher under the ViewTouch copyright and trademark. Instead of using GEM, he developed a GUI and widget framework for the application using the NEOchrome paint program.

===Software development===
The 520ST was bundled with both Digital Research Logo and Atari ST BASIC. Third-party BASIC systems with better performance were eventually released: HiSoft BASIC, GFA BASIC, FaST BASIC, DBASIC, LDW BASIC, Omikron BASIC, BASIC 1000D and STOS. In the later years of the Atari ST, Omikron Basic was bundled with it in Germany.

Atari&#x27;s initial development kit from Atari is a computer and manuals. The cost discouraged development. The later Atari Developer&#x27;s Kit consists of software and manuals for . It includes a resource kit, C compiler (first Alcyon C, then Mark Williams C), debugger, 68000 assembler, and non-disclosure agreement. The third-party Megamax C development package was .

Other development tools include 68000 assemblers (MadMac from Atari, HiSoft Systems&#x27;s Devpac, TurboAss, GFA-Assembler), Pascal (OSS Personal Pascal, Maxon Pascal, PurePascal), Modula-2, C compilers (Lattice C, Pure C, Megamax C, GNU C, Aztec C, AHCC), LISP, and Prolog.

===Games===

The ST had success in gaming due to the low cost, fast performance, and colorful graphics compared to contemporary PCs or 8-bit systems. ST game developers include Peter Molyneux, Doug Bell, Jeff Minter, Éric Chahi, Jez San, and David Braben.

The realtime pseudo-3D role-playing video game &quot;Dungeon Master&quot;, was developed and released first on the ST, and is considered to be the best-selling software ever produced for the platform. Simulation games like &quot;Falcon&quot; and &quot;Flight Simulator II&quot; use the ST&#x27;s graphics hardware, as do many arcade ports. The 1987 first-person shooter, &quot;MIDI Maze&quot;, uses the MIDI ports to connect up to 16 machines for networked deathmatch play. The critically acclaimed &quot;Another World&quot; was originally released for ST and Amiga in 1991 with its engine developed on the ST and the rotoscoped animation created on the Amiga. While American developers stopped making ST games around 1991 (The Secret of Monkey Island was the last major American-coded title) it remained popular with many European developers (primarily in France and Britain) until 1993. Games like &quot;Substation&quot; in 1995 attempted to compete with titles for newer systems.

The ST&#x27;s lack of hardware scrolling meant that many games used smaller screen windows, or flick-screen gameplay instead of scrolling. Combined with sound hardware that was not considered the equal of the Amiga or Commodore 64, the machine&#x27;s performance for 2D arcade games was seen as its weakest point. Games simultaneously released on the Amiga that do not use the Amiga&#x27;s superior graphics and sound capabilities were often accused by video game magazines of simply being ST ports.. While the ST was often the lead machine, or jointly with the Amiga version, for the 68000 coded versions, later titles such as Lemmings, Cannon Fodder, Turrican II, Sensible Soccer, The Chaos Engine and Civilization were usually coded for the Amiga in 32 colors first and later converted down to the ST in 16 colors.

=== Emulators ===
Spectre GCR emulates the Macintosh. MS-DOS emulators were released in the late 1980s. PC-Ditto has a software-only version, and a hardware version that plugs into the cartridge slot or kludges internally. After running the software, an MS-DOS boot disk is required to load the system. Both run MS-DOS programs in CGA mode, though much more slowly than on an IBM PC. Other options are the PC-Speed (NEC V30), AT-Spee (Intel 80286), and ATonce-386SX (Intel 80386SX) hardware emulator boards.

== Music industry==
The ST&#x27;s low cost, built-in MIDI ports, and fast, low-latency response times made it a favorite with musicians.

* Dario G used the Atari ST to produce the dance track &quot;Sunchyme&quot; which reached No. 2 in the UK charts.

== Technical specifications ==
All STs are made up of both custom and commercial chips.
* Custom chips:
** ST Shifter &quot;Video shift register chip&quot;: Enables bitmap graphics using 32 KB of contiguous memory for all resolutions. Screen address has to be a multiple of 256.
** ST GLU &quot;Generalized Logic Unit&quot;: Control logic for the system used to connect the ST&#x27;s chips. Not part of the data path, but needed to bridge chips with each other.
** ST MMU &quot;Memory Management Unit&quot;: Provides signals needed for CPU/blitter/DMA and Shifter to access dynamic RAM. Even memory accesses are given to CPU/blitter/DMA while odd cycles are reserved for DRAM refresh or used by Shifter for displaying contents of the frame buffer.
** ST DMA &quot;Direct Memory Access&quot;: Used for floppy and hard drive data transfers. Can directly access main memory in the ST.
* Support chips:

=== ST/STF/STM/STFM ===
As originally released in the 520ST:

* CPU: Motorola 68000 16-/32-bit CPU&lt;ref &quot;16/32&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; @ 8 MHz. 16-bit data/32-bit internal/24-bit address.
* RAM: 512 KB or 1 MB
* Display modes (60 Hz NTSC, 50 Hz PAL, 71.2 Hz monochrome):
** Low resolution: 320 × 200 (16 color), palette of 512 colors
** Medium resolution: 640 × 200 (4 color), palette of 512 colors
** High resolution: 640 × 400, monochrome
* Sound: Yamaha YM2149 3-voice square wave plus 1-voice white noise mono Programmable Sound Generator
* Drive: Single-sided 3&quot; floppy disk drive, 360 KB capacity when formatted to standard 9 sector, 80 track layout.
* Ports: TV out (on ST-M and ST-FM models, NTSC or PAL standard RF-modulated), MIDI in/out (with &#x27;out-thru&#x27;), RS-232 serial, Centronics parallel (printer), monitor (RGB or Composite Video color and mono, 13-pin DIN), extra disk drive port (14-pin DIN), DMA port (ACSI port, Atari Computer System Interface) for hard disks and Atari Laser Printer (sharing RAM with computer system), joystick and mouse ports (9-pin MSX standard)
* Operating System: TOS v1.00 with Graphics Environment Manager (GEM)

Very early machines have the OS on a floppy disk before a final version was burned into ROM. This version of TOS was bootstrapped from a small core boot ROM.

In 1986, most production models became STFs, with an integrated single- (520STF) or double-sided (1040STF) double density floppy disk drive built-in, but no other changes. Also in 1986, the &quot;520STM&quot; (or &quot;520STM&quot;) added an RF modulator for allowing the low and medium resolution color modes when connected to a TV. Later &quot;F&quot; and &quot;FM&quot; models of the 520 had a built-in double-sided disk drive instead of a single-sided one.

=== STE ===
As originally released in the 520STE/1040STE:

* All of the features of the 520STFM/1040STFM
* Extended palette of 4,096 available colors to choose from
* Blitter chip (stylized as BLiTTER) to copy/fill/clear large data blocks with a max write rate of 4 Mbytes/s
* Hardware support for horizontal and vertical fine scrolling and split screen (using the Shifter video chip)
* DMA sound chip with 2-channels stereo 8-bit PCM sound at 6.25/12.5/25/50 kHz and stereo RCA audio-out jacks (using enhancements to the Shifter video chip to support audio shifting)
* National LMC 1992 audio controller chip, allowing adjustable left/right/master volume and bass and treble EQ via a Microwire interface
* Memory: 30-pin SIMM memory slots (SIPP packages in earliest versions) allowing upgrades up to 4 MB Allowable memory sizes including only 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 2.5 and 4.0 MB due to configuration restraints (however, 2.5 MB is not officially supported and has compatibility problems). Later third-party upgrade kits allow a maximum of 14 MB w/Magnum-ST, bypassing the stock MMU with a replacement unit and the additional chips on a separate board fitting over it.
* Ability to synchronize the video timings with an external device so that a video Genlock device can be used without having to make any modifications to computer&#x27;s hardware
* Analogue joypad ports (2), with support for devices such as paddles and light pens in addition to joysticks/joypads. The Atari Jaguar joypads and Power Pad joypads (gray version of Jaguar joypads marketed for the STE and Falcon) can be used without an adapter. Two standard Atari-style digital joysticks could be plugged into each analogue port with an adapter.
* TOS 1.06 (also known as TOS 1.6) or TOS 1.62 (which fixed some major backwards-compatibility bugs in TOS 1.6) in two socketed 128 KB ROM chips.
* Socketed PLCC 68000 CPU

== Models ==
The members of the ST family are listed below, in roughly chronological order:

; 520ST: original model with 512 KB RAM, external power supply, no floppy disk drive. The early models had only a bootstrap ROM and TOS had to be loaded from disk.
; 520ST+: same as the original model 520ST, but with 1 MB of RAM,
; 260ST: originally intended to be a 256 KB variant, but actually sold in small quantities in Europe with 512 KB. Used after the release of the 520ST+ to differentiate the cheaper 512 KB models from the 1  MB models. Because the early 520STs were sold with TOS on disk, which used up 192 KB of RAM, the machine only had around 256 KB left.
; 520STM: a 520ST with a built-in modulator for TV output and 512 KB RAM.
; 520STFM: a 520STM with a redesigned motherboard in a larger case with a built-in floppy disk drive (in some cases a single-sided drive only), and 512 KB RAM.
; 520STF: a 520STFM without RF modulator
; 1040STF: a 520STFM with 1 MB of RAM and a built-in double-sided floppy disk drive, but without RF modulator
; 1040STFM: a 520STFM with 1 MB of RAM and a built-in double-sided floppy disk drive with RF modulator
; Mega ST (MEGA 1, MEGA 2, MEGA 4): redesigned motherboard with 1, 2 or 4 MB of RAM, respectively, in a much improved &quot;pizza box&quot; case with a detached keyboard. All MEGA mainboards have a PLCC socket for the BLiTTER chip and some early models did not include the BLiTTER chip. They also included a real-time clock and internal expansion connector. Some early MEGA 2 had a MEGA 4 mainboard with half of the memory chip places unpopulated and the MEGA 2 can be upgraded by adding the additional DRAM chips and some resistors for the control lines. The MEGA 1 mainboards had a redesigned memory chip area and could not be upgraded in this way as there are only places for the 1 MB DRAM chips.
; 520STE and 1040STE: a 520STFM/1040STFM with enhanced sound, a BLiTTER chip, and a 4096-color palette, in the older 1040-style all-in-one case
; Mega STE: same hardware as 1040STE except for a faster 16 MHz processor with 16K cache, an onboard SCSI controller, additional faster RS232 port, VME expansion port, in an ST gray version of the TT case
; STacy: a portable (but definitely not laptop) version of the ST with the complete ST keyboard, an LCD screen simulating 640x400 hi-res, and a mini-trackball intended mostly for travelers and musicians because of the backlit screen and its built-in midi ports. Originally designed to operate on 12 standard C cell flashlight batteries for portability, when Atari finally realized how quickly the machine would use up a set of batteries (especially when rechargeable batteries of the time supplied insufficient power compared to the intended alkalines), they simply glued the lid of the battery compartment shut.
; ST BOOK: a later portable ST, more portable than the STacy, but sacrificing several features in order to achieve this, notably the backlight and internal floppy disk drive. Files were meant to be stored on a small amount (one megabyte) of internal flash memory &#x27;on the road&#x27; and transferred using serial or parallel links, memory flashcards or external (and externally powered) floppy disk to a desktop ST once back indoors. The screen is highly reflective for the time, but still hard to use indoors or in low light, it is fixed to the 640 × 400 1-bit mono mode, and no external video port was provided. Despite its limitations, it gained some popularity, particularly amongst musicians.

=== Unreleased ===
The 130ST was intended to be a 128 KB variant. It was announced at the 1985 CES alongside the 520ST but never produced. The 4160STE was a 1040STE, but with 4 MB of RAM. A small quantity of development units were produced, but the system was never officially released. Atari did produce a quantity of 4160STE metallic case badges which found their way to dealers, so it&#x27;s not uncommon to find one attached to systems which were originally 520/1040STE. No such labels were produced for the base of the systems.

<text>The following is a list of current and past, non-classified notable artificial intelligence projects.
==Specialized projects==

===Brain-inspired===
* Blue Brain Project, an attempt to create a synthetic brain by reverse-engineering the mammalian brain down to the molecular level.
* Google Brain, a deep learning project part of Google X attempting to have intelligence similar or equal to human-level.
* Human Brain Project, ten-year scientific research project, based on exascale supercomputers.

===Cognitive architectures===

* 4CAPS, developed at Carnegie Mellon University under Marcel A. Just
* ACT-R, developed at Carnegie Mellon University under John R. Anderson.
* AIXI, Universal Artificial Intelligence developed by Marcus Hutter at IDSIA and ANU.
* CALO, a DARPA-funded, 25-institution effort to integrate many artificial intelligence approaches (natural language processing, speech recognition, machine vision, probabilistic logic, planning, reasoning, many forms of machine learning) into an AI assistant that learns to help manage your office environment.
* CHREST, developed under Fernand Gobet at Brunel University and Peter C. Lane at the University of Hertfordshire.
* CLARION, developed under Ron Sun at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and University of Missouri.
* CoJACK, an ACT-R inspired extension to the JACK multi-agent system that adds a cognitive architecture to the agents for eliciting more realistic (human-like) behaviors in virtual environments.
* Copycat, by Douglas Hofstadter and Melanie Mitchell at the Indiana University.
* DUAL, developed at the New Bulgarian University under Boicho Kokinov.
* FORR developed by Susan L. Epstein at The City University of New York.
* IDA and LIDA, implementing Global Workspace Theory, developed under Stan Franklin at the University of Memphis.
* OpenCog Prime, developed using the OpenCog Framework.
* Procedural Reasoning System (PRS), developed by Michael Georgeff and Amy L. Lansky at SRI International.
* Psi-Theory developed under Dietrich Dörner at the Otto-Friedrich University in Bamberg, Germany.
* Soar, developed under Allen Newell and John Laird at Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Michigan.
* &quot;Society of Mind&quot; and its successor &quot;The Emotion Machine&quot; proposed by Marvin Minsky.
* Subsumption architectures, developed e.g. by Rodney Brooks (though it could be argued whether they are &quot;cognitive&quot;).

===Games===
* AlphaGo, software developed by Google that plays the Chinese board game Go.

<text>Aaliyah Dana Haughton ( ; January 16, 1979 – August 25, 2001) was an American singer, actress, dancer, and model. She has been credited with helping to redefine contemporary R&amp;B, pop, and hip hop, earning her the nicknames the &quot;Princess of R&amp;B&quot; and &quot;Queen of Urban Pop&quot;.

Born in Brooklyn and raised in Detroit, she first gained recognition at the age of 10, when she appeared on the television show &quot;Star Search&quot; and performed in concert alongside Gladys Knight. At the age of 12, Aaliyah signed with Jive Records and her uncle Barry Hankerson&#x27;s Blackground Records. Hankerson introduced her to R. Kelly, who became her mentor, as well as lead songwriter and producer of her debut album, &quot;Age Ain&#x27;t Nothing but a Number&quot; (1994). The album sold three million copies in the United States and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). After allegations of an illegal marriage with Kelly, Aaliyah ended her contract with Jive and signed with Atlantic Records.

Aaliyah worked with record producers Timbaland and Missy Elliott for her second album, &quot;One in a Million&quot; (1996), which sold three million copies in the United States and more than eight million copies worldwide. In 2000, Aaliyah made her acting debut in the action film &quot;Romeo Must Die&quot;, alongside Jet Li. She contributed to the film&#x27;s soundtrack, which was supported by her single &quot;Try Again&quot;. The song topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 solely through airplay, becoming the first in the chart&#x27;s history to do so. After completing the film, Aaliyah subsequently filmed her starring role in &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot; (which was released posthumously), and in July 2001, released her eponymous third album, which topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album spawned the singles &quot;We Need a Resolution&quot;, &quot;Rock the Boat&quot; and &quot;More Than a Woman&quot;.

On August 25, 2001, at the age of 22, Aaliyah was killed in the Marsh Harbour Cessna 402 crash along with eight other people on board, when the overloaded aircraft she was traveling in crashed shortly after takeoff. The pilot was later found to have traces of cocaine and alcohol in his body and was not qualified to fly the aircraft designated for the flight. Aaliyah&#x27;s family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the aircraft&#x27;s operator, which was settled out of court. In the decades following her death, Aaliyah&#x27;s music has continued to achieve commercial success, aided by several posthumous releases. She has sold 8.1 million albums in the US and an estimated 24 to 32 million albums worldwide. &quot;Billboard&quot; lists her as the tenth most successful female R&amp;B artist of the past 25 years, and the 27th most successful in history. Her accolades include three American Music Awards and two MTV VMAs, along with five Grammy Award nominations.

==Early life==
Aaliyah Dana Haughton was born on January 16, 1979, in Brooklyn, New York City, the younger child of Diane and Michael &quot;Miguel&quot; Haughton, a warehouse worker. She was of African-American, Jamaican and Native American descent. Her name is the feminine form of the Arabic &quot;Ali&quot;, meaning &quot;highest, most exalted one, the best.&quot; Aaliyah was fond of her name, calling it &quot;beautiful&quot; and saying she was &quot;very proud of it&quot; and strove to live up to her name every day. When she was five years old, her family moved to Detroit, Michigan, where she was raised along with her older brother, Rashad. In Detroit, her father began working in the warehouse business, one of his brother-in-law Barry Hankerson&#x27;s widening interests. Her mother stayed home and raised her and her brother. Her mother enrolled her in voice lessons at an early age. Eventually, she started performing at weddings, church choir, and charity events. Aaliyah attended a Catholic school, Gesu Elementary, where in first grade she was cast in the stage play &quot;Annie&quot; which inspired her to become an entertainer.

Aaliyah&#x27;s mother was a vocalist, and her uncle Hankerson was an entertainment lawyer who had been married to Gladys Knight. As a child, Aaliyah traveled with Knight and worked with an agent in New York City to audition for commercials and television programs, including &quot;Family Matters&quot;. After failing to land a role on the show she continued her acting through the Gesu Players. In 1989 at age ten she appeared on &quot;Star Search&quot;, where she performed &quot;My Funny Valentine&quot;. Aaliyah chose to begin auditioning. Her mother made the decision to drop her surname. She auditioned for several record labels and at age 11 appeared in concerts alongside Knight. After attending a Gladys Knight concert with music executive Suge Knight, and seeing Aaliyah perform on stage, rapper Tupac Shakur wanted to sign her to a record deal. During her childhood, she had several pet animals including ducks, snakes and iguanas. Her cousin Jomo had a pet alligator, which Aaliyah felt was too much, remarking, &quot;that was something I wasn&#x27;t going to stroke.&quot;

Aaliyah attended Detroit schools and believed she was well-liked, but she was teased for her short stature. By age 15, however, she came to love her height. Her mother told her to be happy she was small and complimented her. Although some children disliked Aaliyah, she determined, &quot;You always have to deal with people who are jealous, but there were so few it didn&#x27;t even matter. The majority of kids supported me, which was wonderful.&quot; Even in her adult life, she considered herself small. She had &quot;learned to accept and love&quot; herself and added: &quot;the most important thing is to think highly of yourself because if you don&#x27;t, no one else will&quot;.

During her audition for acceptance to the Detroit High School for the Fine and Performing Arts, Aaliyah sang &quot;Ave Maria&quot; in Latin. Aaliyah held a 4.0 grade-point average when graduating from high school. She reflected: &quot;I wanted to keep that 4.0. Being in the industry, you know, I don&#x27;t want kids to think, &#x27;I can just sing and forget about school.&#x27; I think it&#x27;s very important to have an education, and even more important to have something to fall back on.&quot; She considered a future career teaching music, music history or drama if she did not make a living as a recording artist because, as she reasoned, &quot;when you pick a career it has to be something you love&quot;.

==Career==
===1991–1995: &quot;Age Ain&#x27;t Nothing but a Number&quot;===
After Hankerson signed a distribution deal with Jive Records, he signed Aaliyah to his Blackground Records label at the age of 12. Hankerson later introduced her to recording artist and producer R. Kelly, who became Aaliyah&#x27;s mentor, as well as lead songwriter and producer of her first album, recorded when she was 14. Aaliyah&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Age Ain&#x27;t Nothing but a Number&quot;, was released under her mononym &quot;Aaliyah&quot;, by Jive and Blackground Records on May 24, 1994; it debuted at number 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, selling 38,000 copies in its first week. It peaked at number 18 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and it was certified two times Platinum by the RIAA. To date the album has sold over 3 million copies in the US. In Canada, the album was certified gold by Music Canada for 50,000 copies in shipments. In 2014, &quot;Vibe&quot; magazine estimated that the album had sold six million copies globally.

Upon its release, &quot;Age Ain&#x27;t Nothing But a Number&quot; received generally favorable reviews from music critics. Some writers noted that Aaliyah&#x27;s &quot;silky vocals&quot; and &quot;sultry voice&quot; blended with Kelly&#x27;s new jack swing helped define R&amp;B in the 1990s. Her sound was also compared to that of female quartet En Vogue. Christopher John Farley of &quot;Time&quot; magazine called the album a &quot;beautifully restrained work&quot;, noting that Aaliyah&#x27;s &quot;girlish, breathy vocals rode calmly on R. Kelly&#x27;s rough beats&quot;. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic felt that the album had its &quot;share of filler&quot;, but described the singles as &quot;slyly seductive&quot;. He also wrote that the songs on the album were &quot;frequently better&quot; than that of Kelly&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;12 Play&quot;. The single &quot;At Your Best (You Are Love)&quot; was criticized by &quot;Billboard&quot; for being out of place on the album and for its length.

Aaliyah&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Back &amp; Forth&quot;, peaked at number 5 on the Hot 100 and topped the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart for three weeks. Two more singles charted: a cover of the Isley Brothers&#x27; &quot;At Your Best (You Are Love)&quot; peaked at number 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and the album&#x27;s title track, &quot;Age Ain&#x27;t Nothing but a Number&quot;, peaked at number 75. Additionally, she released &quot;The Thing I Like&quot; as part of the soundtrack to the 1994 film &quot;A Low Down Dirty Shame&quot;.

===1996–2000: &quot;One in a Million&quot; and &quot;Romeo Must Die&quot;===
In 1996, Aaliyah left Jive Records and signed with Atlantic Records. She worked with record producers Timbaland and Missy Elliott, who contributed to her second studio album, &quot;One in a Million&quot;. Elliott recalled Timbaland and herself being nervous to work with Aaliyah, since Aaliyah had already released her successful debut album while Elliott and Timbaland were just starting out. Elliott also feared she would be a diva, but reflected that Aaliyah &quot;came in and was so warming; she made us immediately feel like family.&quot; The album yielded the lead single &quot;If Your Girl Only Knew&quot;, which peaked at number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs for two weeks. It also generated the singles &quot;Hot Like Fire&quot; and &quot;4 Page Letter&quot;. &quot;One in a Million&quot; peaked at number 18 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and was certified double platinum by the RIAA on June 16, 1997, denoting shipments of two million copies. The album went on to sell 3 million copies in the US and over eight million copies worldwide. The year after her album was released, Aaliyah was featured on Timbaland &amp; Magoo&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Up Jumps da Boogie&quot;.

In 1997 Aaliyah graduated with a 4.0 GPA from the Detroit High School for the Fine and Performing Arts, where she majored in drama. The same year, she began her acting career, playing herself in the police drama television series &quot;New York Undercover&quot;. During this time, Aaliyah participated in the Children&#x27;s Benefit Concert, a charity concert at the Beacon Theatre in New York. She also became the spokesperson for the Tommy Hilfiger Corporation. During her campaign with Tommy Hilfiger, the company sold over 2,400 pairs of the red, white and blue baggy jeans she wore in their advertisements. In December 1997, she performed the Christmas carol &quot;What Child Is This?&quot; at the annual Christmas in Washington television special. She also contributed to the soundtrack album for the animated film &quot;Anastasia&quot;, performing a cover version of &quot;Journey to the Past&quot; that earned songwriters Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. Aaliyah performed the song at the 1998 Academy Awards ceremony, becoming the youngest singer to perform at the event. Also in 1998, she released the song &quot;Are You That Somebody?&quot; which was featured on the &quot;Dr. Dolittle&quot; soundtrack. The song peaked at number 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and earned Aaliyah her first Grammy Award nomination.

In 1999, Aaliyah landed her first big-screen acting role in &quot;Romeo Must Die&quot;. She starred opposite martial artist Jet Li, playing a couple who fall in love amid their warring families. Released on March 24, 2000, the movie grossed US$18.6 million in its first weekend, ranking number two at the box office. Aaliyah purposely stayed away from reviews of the film to &quot;make it easier on&quot; herself, but she heard &quot;that people were able to get into me, which is what I wanted.&quot; In contrast, some critics felt there was no chemistry between her and Jet Li, as well as viewing the film as too simplistic. This was echoed by Elvis Mitchell of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, who wrote that while Aaliyah was &quot;a natural&quot; and the film was conceived as a spotlight for both her and Li, &quot;they have so little chemistry together you&#x27;d think they&#x27;re putting out a fire instead of shooting off sparks.
In addition to acting, Aaliyah served as an executive producer of the film&#x27;s soundtrack, for which she contributed four songs. &quot;Try Again&quot; was released as a single from the soundtrack; the song topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, making Aaliyah the first artist to top the chart based solely on airplay; this led the song to be released in a 12-inch vinyl and 7-inch single. The music video won the Best Female Video and Best Video from a Film awards at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards. It also earned her a Grammy Award nomination for Best Female R&amp;B Vocalist. The soundtrack went on to sell 1.5 million copies in the United States.

===2001: &quot;Aaliyah&quot; and &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot;===

After completing &quot;Romeo Must Die&quot;, Aaliyah began to work on her second film, &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot;. She played the role of an ancient vampire, Queen Akasha, which she described as a &quot;manipulative, crazy, sexual being&quot;. Filming both Romeo Must Die and &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot; delayed the release of the album. Aaliyah had not intended for her albums to have such a gap between them. &quot;I wanted to take a break after &quot;One in a Million&quot; to just relax, think about how I wanted to approach the next album. Then, when I was ready to start back up, &quot;Romeo&quot; happened, and so I had to take another break and do that film and then do the soundtrack, then promote it. The break turned into a longer break than I anticipated.&quot; Ultimately, she filmed &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot; and recorded her third album at the same time so that it could be released in 2001. Aaliyah enjoyed balancing her singing and acting careers. Though she called music a &quot;first&quot; for her, she also had been acting since she was young and had wanted to begin acting &quot;at some point in my career&quot;, but &quot;wanted it to be the right time and the right vehicle&quot; and felt &quot;Romeo Must Die&quot; &quot;was it&quot;. Connie Johnson of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; argued that Aaliyah having to focus on her film career may have caused her to not give the album &quot;the attention it merited.&quot;

During the recording stages for the album, Aaliyah&#x27;s publicist disclosed that the album&#x27;s release date was most likely in October 2000. Eventually, she finished recording the album in March 2001; after a year of recording tracks that began in March of the previous year.
&quot;Aaliyah&quot; was released five years after &quot;One in a Million&quot; on July 17, 2001, and it debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 187,000 copies in its first week. The first single from the album, &quot;We Need a Resolution&quot;, peaked at number 59 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The week after Aaliyah&#x27;s death, her third album rose from number 19 to number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Rock the Boat&quot; was released as a posthumous single. The music video premiered on BET&#x27;s &quot;Access Granted&quot;, and it became the most viewed and highest rated episode in the history of the show. The song peaked at number 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Promotional posters for &quot;Aaliyah&quot; that had been put up in major cities such as New York and Los Angeles became makeshift memorials for grieving fans. In February 2002, the album was certified double Platinum by the RIAA.

&quot;More than a Woman&quot; and &quot;I Care 4 U&quot; were released as posthumous singles and peaked within the top 25 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;More than a Woman&quot; reached number one on the UK singles chart making Aaliyah the first female deceased artist to reach number one on the UK singles chart. &quot;More than a Woman&quot; was replaced by George Harrison&#x27;s &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; which is the only time in the UK singles chart&#x27;s history when a dead artist has replaced another dead artist at number one.

Aaliyah was signed to appear in several future films, including a romantic film titled &quot;Some Kind of Blue&quot;, and a Whitney Houston–produced remake of the 1976 film &quot;Sparkle&quot;. Houston recalled Aaliyah being &quot;so enthusiastic&quot; about the film; the project was shelved after she died. Before her death, Aaliyah filmed some scenes for the sequels of &quot;The Matrix&quot; as the character Zee. A portion of her role in &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; was filmed; these unused scenes were included in the tribute section of the &quot;Matrix Ultimate Collection&quot; series.

==Artistry==
===Voice===

Aaliyah had the vocal range of a soprano, and with the release of her debut album &quot;Age Ain&#x27;t Nothing but a Number&quot;, writer Dimitri Ehrlich of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; compared her style and sound to R&amp;B group En Vogue. Ehrlich also expressed that Aaliyah&#x27;s &quot;silky vocals are more agile than those of self-proclaimed queen of hip-hop soul Mary J. Blige.&quot; In her review for Aaliyah&#x27;s second studio album &quot;One in a Million&quot; &quot;Vibe&quot; magazine, music critic Dream Hampton said that Aaliyah&#x27;s &quot;deliciously feline&quot; voice has the same &quot;pop appeal&quot; as Janet Jackson&#x27;s. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; &quot;the most remarkable thing about Aaliyah&#x27;s voice, besides its flexibility and crisp range, was its almost preternatural poise — she always seemed to be holding her power in reserve, to know every side of the scenarios she described&quot;. While, Siân Pattenden from &quot;Mixmag&quot; stated that, &quot;She doesn&#x27;t try to toss the caber with vocal athleticism. There&#x27;s no shouting, screeching, wailing or jazz-style noodling. Everything is underplayed: Ms Haughton&#x27;s range is displayed by the slightest high-octave backing and tiniest harmonies&quot;.

Aaliyah herself said her vocal styling consisted of her singing softly while utilizing her falsetto. She further explained saying, &quot;My signature style is breathy, tone-y, airy. It&#x27;s simple but I can ride a crazy track.&quot; Although she frequently sang in a softer tone, there were moments when she utilized other facets of her voice. &quot;Never Givin&#x27; Up&quot; (1996) and &quot;The One I Gave My Heart To&quot; (1997) are a few stand-out vocal highlights. Daryl Simmons the producer of &quot;The One I Gave My Heart To&quot;, recalled Aaliyah doing opera vocal warm-up exercises in preparation for the songs recording. While commenting on her doing opera vocal warm ups Simmons mentioned, &quot;It was the furthest thing I would have ever thought that she could do. It just blew my mind.&quot; The song&#x27;s writer, Diane Warren praised her vocals on the song, saying: &quot;It showed her vocal range, and I know a couple of people thought she wouldn&#x27;t be able to do that song. I thought, &#x27;No, she&#x27;ll be able to do that.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; echoed a similar sentiment as Warren, saying &quot;The One I Gave My Heart To&quot; &quot;showcased Aaliyah&#x27;s ability to hit higher notes.&quot; Discussing her approach on &quot;Never Givin&#x27; Up&quot; producer Craig King said, &quot;lyrically and vocally she just took you to places that you didn&#x27;t know she could go&quot;.

===Musical style===
From the very beginning, she opted &quot;for an edgier, more mature sound&quot;, and her songs were often uptempo and at the same time often dark, revolving around &quot;matters of the heart&quot;. She &quot;easily straddled the hip-hop and pop worlds, never projecting the frilliness of her ingénue peers&quot;. After her R. Kelly–produced debut album, Aaliyah worked with Timbaland and Missy Elliott, whose productions were more electronic. The duo &quot;mixed choppy, nervous rhythms over loops of computer-generated backing tracks, and incorporating harmonies which – within the genre&#x27;s limited horizons – seemed daring&quot;. They also created, the &quot;Freeze-and-stop style of singing on top of bass-heavy instrumentals&quot; which became Aaliyah&#x27;s signature style. In 2001, Aaliyah called her sound &quot;street but sweet&quot;, pairing feminine vocals with a gritty urban rhythm track. In another interview she further spoke about her artistry, saying, &quot;I love to fuse other types of music with my own&quot;. She explored a wide range of genres such as R&amp;B, pop, hip hop, funk, soul, and dance-pop. Altogether, Aaliyah&#x27;s music can be described as alternative R&amp;B, progressive soul, and neo soul, according to &quot;Time&quot; Farley.

Aaliyah released &quot;musically risky singles into a notoriously fickle pop market&quot;, without being &quot;concerned about conforming to the stereotypes of the marketplace&quot;. Her songs &quot;gracefully walk a line between commerciality and experimentation&quot;. Aaliyah&#x27;s records tend to have a &quot;crisp production&quot; and &quot;staccato arrangements&quot; that &quot;extend genre boundaries&quot; while containing &quot;old-school&quot; soul music. Kelefah Sanneh of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called her &quot;a digital diva who wove a spell with ones and zeroes&quot;, and writes that her songs comprised &quot;simple vocal riffs, repeated and refracted to echo the manipulated loops that create digital rhythm&quot;, as Timbaland&#x27;s &quot;computer-programmed beats fitted perfectly with her cool, breathy voice to create a new kind of electronic music.&quot; 

In &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), Keith Harris said of her lyrical content that &quot;When it came to sexual availability, she was between En Vogue maliciously taunting &#x27;You&#x27;re never gonna get it&#x27; and Tweet blankly cooing &#x27;Oops, there goes my shirt.&#x27;&quot; Lyrically, &quot;Her first two albums carefully toed the line between adolescence and adulthood, displaying a woman exploring the terrain of love, trust, and lust; one who exuded a playful innocence while hinting at a more sultry side.&quot; Aaliyah did not usually write her own lyrics. The only time she had a hand in writing is on the song &quot;Death of a Playa&quot; from the &quot;Hot Like Fire&quot; single (1997). She co-wrote that song with her brother Rashad Haughton, and &quot;it reflects Aaliyah&#x27;s dark perspective on romance&quot;. Of her role in crafting her music, Aaliyah said, &quot;I like to have the final say but I was trained as a singer, actress and dancer, the interpreter, bringing other people&#x27;s words to life. I need the songs to reflect me in one way or another&quot;. 

As her albums progressed, writers felt that Aaliyah matured, calling her progress a &quot;near-flawless declaration of strength and independence&quot;. ABC News noted that her music was &quot;evolving from the punchy pop-influenced hip hop and R&amp;B to a more mature, introspective sound&quot;, on her third album. &quot;NME&quot; called her third album &quot;radical&quot; and said that it was &quot;intended to consolidate her position as U.S. R&amp;B&#x27;s most experimental artist&quot;. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described her album &quot;Aaliyah&quot; as &quot;a statement of maturity and a stunning artistic leap forward&quot;, and called it one of the strongest urban soul records of its time. She portrayed &quot;unfamiliar sounds, styles and emotions&quot;, but managed to please critics with the contemporary sound it contained. Ernest Hardy of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; felt that Aaliyah was displaying stronger technique, giving her best vocal performances on the album.

===Influences===
As an artist, Aaliyah said she was inspired by a number of performers. These include Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Sade, Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, Korn, Donnie Hathaway, Johnny Mathis, Janet Jackson, Whitney Houston, and Barbra Streisand. Aaliyah said that Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot; was her &quot;favorite album&quot; and that &quot;nothing will ever top &quot;Thriller&quot;.&quot; She said she had always wanted to work with Janet Jackson, to whom she had often been compared, saying, &quot;I admire her a great deal. She&#x27;s a total performer ... I&#x27;d love to do a duet with Janet Jackson.&quot; Jackson reciprocated Aaliyah&#x27;s affection, saying, &quot;I&#x27;ve loved her from the beginning because she always comes out and does something different, musically.&quot; Jackson also said she would have enjoyed collaborating with Aaliyah.

===Music videos===
According to director Paul Hunter from day one, &quot;Aaliyah wanted her videos to stand out from clips by other R&amp;B singers&quot;. He stated, &quot;You can watch programming all day and see a certain type of video by female artists, &quot;Then when one of hers comes on it&#x27;s something special, something different to look at. That&#x27;s what she was about.&quot; Christopher John Farley from &quot;Time&quot; stated that Aaliyah&#x27;s &quot;videos, for the most part, are about mood, not about storylines... Her videos are usually lushly shot and infused with sexual tension, though not in overt and obvious ways&quot;.

Alisha Acquaye from &quot;Teen Vogue&quot; felt that, &quot;There&#x27;s much to gather while watching an Aaliyah music video&quot; in fact, she thinks that watching them is &quot;actually an understatement&quot;. Acquaye further explained, &quot;There&#x27;s a state of hypnosis you submit to as she envelops you through sight and sound, tugging at your heartstrings. Between a sequence of sensual, strong movements, infectious instrumentals, and intuitive lyrics that spark emotions of desire, sex, and empowerment, you are enraptured in Aaliyah&#x27;s physical presence&quot;.

Most of Aaliyah&#x27;s videos included dance routines. While discussing her video choreography &quot;Billboard&quot; mentioned that she &quot;coined the smooth choreography and tomboyish style that would inspire [R&amp;B]&#x27;s future generations for years to come&quot;. &quot;Vibe&quot; praised several videos saying, &quot;Looking back on her videos like &quot;Try Again&quot; and &quot;Are You That Somebody,&quot; Aaliyah&#x27;s talent in all of those techniques of dancing are apparent, as she&#x27;s able to hit every syncopated word and beat with ease as if she&#x27;s moving on air&quot;. Kyann-Sian Williams from &quot;NME&quot; named &quot;Are You That Somebody?&quot; as a visual that, &quot;pushed the boundaries when it came to dance breaks in music videos&quot;. Williams declared, &quot;Until that time, dance breaks were usually reserved for boybands like *NSync and the Backstreet Boys, but Aaliyah claimed it for R&amp;B stars too&quot;.

==Public image==
Aaliyah focused on her public image while protecting her private life. She felt that it was &quot;important ... to differentiate yourself from the rest of the pack&quot;. &quot;USA Today&quot; said, &quot;Her slinky vocal style and eye-popping videos made her a crossover star, while her persistent protection of her privacy added an air of intrigue about her&quot;. According to Aaliyah, &quot;I put a lot of pressure on myself to be true to myself and not let anything else influence me to do what someone else is doing. Being a little edgy and sexy is me. My image isn&#x27;t a put-on. I&#x27;m happy to put over that dark edge in my videos, because it&#x27;s always been there. I used to wear my sunglasses or have my hair over one eye a lot more when I was younger. [Now] I&#x27;m happy with all aspects of myself.&quot;

She often wore baggy clothes and sunglasses, stating that she wanted to be herself. Aaliyah also wore black clothing, starting a trend for similar fashion among women in United States and Japan. In 1998, she hired a personal trainer to keep in shape, and exercised five days a week and ate diet foods. As her career progressed, &quot;she went through so many fashion revamps&quot;. For example, When she changed her hairstyle, Aaliyah took her mother&#x27;s advice and covered her left eye, much like Veronica Lake. The look has become known as her signature and been referred to as fusion of &quot;unnerving emotional honesty&quot; and &quot;a sense of mystique&quot;. In regards to her fashion choices, writer Jeff Lorez described her as a &quot;model of understatement&quot;. According to Lorez, &quot;She&#x27;s beautiful, but hardly in a high-gloss, supermodel way—more like a really good-looking girl next door. And rather than bling-blinging her ice in a ghetto-fabulous manner befitting her Trumped-up surroundings, she blings on the down-low: A subtle bracelet here, a winking pendant there, offset by her simple black jeans and matching sweater. Trés cool&quot;. Former TRL host Carson Daly said that she was &quot;cutting edge, always one step ahead of the curve and that the TRL audience looks to her to figure out what&#x27;s hot and what&#x27;s new&quot;.

Aaliyah was often praised for her &quot;clean-cut image&quot; and &quot;moral values&quot;. Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; wrote of Aaliyah&#x27;s artistry and image, &quot;she was lithe and dulcet in a way that signified neither jailbait nor hottie—an ingenue whose selling point was sincerity, not innocence and the obverse it implies.&quot; Emil Wilbekin, told CNN: &quot;Aaliyah is an excellent role model because she started her career in the public eye at age 15 with a gold album,&quot; Age Ain&#x27;t Nothing but a Number&quot;. And then her second album, &quot;One in a Million&quot; went double platinum. She had the leading role in &quot;Romeo Must Die&quot;, which was a box office success. She&#x27;s won numerous awards, several MTV music video awards, and aside from her professional successes, many of her lyrics are very inspirational and uplifting. She also carried herself in a very professional manner. She was well-spoken. She was beautiful, but she didn&#x27;t use her beauty to sell her music. She used her talent. Many young hip-hop fans greatly admire her.&quot;

She was also seen by others as a sex symbol and did not have a problem with being considered one. &quot;I know that people think I&#x27;m sexy and I am looked at as that, and it is cool with me,&quot; she stated. &quot;It&#x27;s wonderful to have sex appeal. If you embrace it, it can be a very beautiful thing. I am totally cool with that. Definitely. I see myself as sexy. If you are comfortable with it, it can be very classy and it can be very appealing.&quot; Aaliyah also felt though her image was &quot;risque and sexy&quot;, it was important to remain respectable because she wanted to make songs that everyone could relate to without it being vulgar. When she participated in fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger&#x27;s All America Tour Tommy Jean ads, she wore boxer shorts, baggy jeans and a tube top. Hilfiger&#x27;s brother, Andy, called it &quot;a whole new look&quot; that was &quot;classy but sexy&quot;. The single &quot;We Need a Resolution&quot; was argued to have transformed &quot;the once tomboy into a sexy grown woman&quot;.

==Personal life==
In an 1995 interview with &quot;Honey&quot;, Aaliyah stated that she was Catholic and she attended church whenever she was at home. In 2001, she told &quot;Vibe&quot; magazine that she was mostly a homebody and liked &quot;the simple things in life.&quot;

===Family===
Aaliyah&#x27;s family played a major role in the course of her career. Beginning in 1995, Aaliyah&#x27;s father Michael Haughton served as her personal manager, and her mother assisted him. Aaliyah&#x27;s brother Rashad Haughton and her cousin Jomo Hankerson were with her when she worked. After her father became ill, her brother Rashad became her manager.

Aaliyah was known to have usually been accompanied by members of her family. Her brother Rashad stated that the filming of &quot;Rock the Boat&quot; was the only time her family was not present during a video shoot. In October 2001, Rashad said: &quot;It really boggles everyone [that] from Day One, every single video she ever shot there&#x27;s always been myself or my mother or my father there. The circumstances surrounding this last video were really strange because my mother had eye surgery and couldn&#x27;t fly. That really bothered her because she always traveled. My dad had to take care of my mom at that time. And I went to Australia to visit some friends. We really couldn&#x27;t understand why we weren&#x27;t there. You ask yourself maybe we could have stopped it. But you can&#x27;t really answer the question. There&#x27;s always gonna be that question of why.&quot; Her friend Kidada Jones said in the last year of Aaliyah&#x27;s life, her parents had given her more freedom and she had spoken about wanting a family.

===Illegal marriage===
Aaliyah reportedly developed an intimate relationship with Kelly during the recording of her debut album. She told &quot;Vibe&quot; magazine in 1994 that she and Kelly would &quot;go watch a movie&quot; and &quot;go eat&quot; when she got tired and would then &quot;come back and work&quot;. She described the relationship between her and Kelly as &quot;rather close.&quot; In December 1994, Aaliyah told the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; that whenever she was asked about being married to Kelly, she urged them not to believe &quot;all that mess&quot; and that she and Kelly were &quot;close&quot; and &quot;people took it the wrong way&quot;.

With the release of &quot;Age Ain&#x27;t Nothing but a Number&quot;, rumors circulated about a relationship between Aaliyah and R. Kelly, including the allegation that they had secretly married without her parents&#x27; knowledge. &quot;Vibe&quot; magazine later revealed a marriage certificate that listed the couple married on August 31, 1994, in Sheraton Gateway Suites in Rosemont, Illinois. Aaliyah, who was 15 at the time, was listed as 18 on the certificate; R. Kelly was 27. The marriage was annulled by her parents in February 1995, but the pair denied the allegations, saying that neither was married and that the certificate was a forgery.

Jamie Foster Brown in the 1994 issue of &quot;Sister 2 Sister&quot; wrote that &quot;R. Kelly told me that he and Aaliyah got together, and it was just magic.&quot; Brown also reported hearing about a sexual relationship between them. &quot;I&#x27;ve been hearing about Robert and Aaliyah for a while—that she was pregnant. Or that she was coming and going in and out of his house. People would see her walking his dog, 12 Play, with her basketball cap and sunglasses on. Every time I asked the label, they said it was platonic. But I kept hearing complaints from people about her being in the studio with all those men.&quot; Brown later added &quot;at 15, you have all those hormones and no brains attached to them&quot;.

In his 2011 book &quot;The Man Behind the Man: Looking from the Inside Out&quot;, Demetrius Smith Sr., Kelly&#x27;s former tour manager, revealed that Kelly married Aaliyah after she told him that she was pregnant. In the 2019 documentary &quot;Surviving R. Kelly&quot;, Smith described how he helped Aaliyah forge the necessary documents to show she was 18 to marry Kelly. Smith also said he was &quot;not proud&quot; of his role in facilitating their marriage. Additionally, the documentary revealed that Jovante Cunningham, a former backup dancer, claimed to have witnessed Kelly having sex with Aaliyah on his tour bus.

Aaliyah admitted in court documents that she had lied about her age. In May 1997, she filed suit in Cook County seeking to have all records of the marriage expunged because she was not old enough under state law to get married without her parents&#x27; consent. It was reported that she cut off all professional and personal ties with Kelly after the marriage was annulled and ceased contact with him. In a 2014 interview, Aaliyah&#x27;s cousin Jomo Hankerson said that she &quot;got villainized&quot; for her relationship with Kelly and the scandal over the marriage made it difficult to find producers for her second album. &quot;We were coming off of a multi-platinum debut album and except for a couple of relationships with Jermaine Dupri and Puffy, it was hard for us to get producers on the album.&quot; Hankerson also expressed confusion over why &quot;they were upset&quot; with Aaliyah given her age at the time.

Aaliyah was known to avoid answering questions about Kelly after the professional split. During an interview with Christopher John Farley, she was asked whether she was still in contact with him and would ever work with him again. Farley said Aaliyah responded with a &quot;firm, frosty &#x27;no to both questions. &quot;Vibe&quot; magazine said Aaliyah changed the subject anytime &quot;you bring up the marriage with her&quot;. A spokeswoman for Aaliyah said in 2000 that when &quot;R. Kelly comes up, she doesn&#x27;t even speak his name, and nobody&#x27;s allowed to ask about it at all.&quot; Kelly later said that Aaliyah had opportunities to address their relationship after they separated professionally but chose not to. In 2019, Damon Dash revealed to &quot;Hip Hop Motivation&quot; that Aaliyah did not even speak of her relationship with Kelly in private; he tried multiple times to discuss it with her, but she would only say that Kelly was a &quot;bad man&quot;. Dash said he was unable to watch &quot;Surviving R. Kelly&quot; because its interviews with visibly traumatized girls struggling to discuss their encounters with Kelly reminded him of how Aaliyah behaved when trying to recount her relationship with Kelly. Dash later appeared in &quot;Surviving R. Kelly, Part II&quot; in 2020.

Other allegations were made about Kelly regarding underage girls in the years after Aaliyah&#x27;s death, and their marriage was used as an example of his involvement with them. He has refused to discuss his relationship with her, citing her death. &quot;Out of respect for her, and her mom and her dad, I will not discuss Aaliyah. That was a whole other situation, a whole other time, it was a whole other thing, and I&#x27;m sure that people also know that.&quot; In 2016, Kelly said that he was as in love with Aaliyah as he was with &quot;anybody else.&quot; Aaliyah&#x27;s mother, Diane Haughton, reflected that everything &quot;that went wrong in her life&quot; began with her relationship with Kelly.

After the documentary &quot;Surviving R. Kelly&quot; aired in January 2019, pressure from the public using the Mute R. Kelly hashtag escalated and RCA Records dropped Kelly from the label. In February 2019, Kelly was indicted on ten counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse. In July 2019, he was arrested on federal charges of sex crimes, human trafficking, child pornography, racketeering, and obstruction of justice. When his trial began in August 2021, Kelly faced 22 federal criminal charges that involved allegedly abusing 11 girls and women between 1994 and 2018. Aaliyah&#x27;s illegal marriage to Kelly was heavily featured in the court case. On September 27, 2021, a federal court jury found Kelly guilty of nine counts including racketeering, sexual exploitation of a child, kidnapping, bribery, sex trafficking, and a violation of the Mann Act. The judge ordered that Kelly remain in custody pending sentencing, which was set for May 4, 2022. On June 29, 2022, Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison.

===Relationship with Damon Dash===
Aaliyah was dating the co-founder of Roc-A-Fella Records, Damon Dash, at the time of her death. Although they were not formally engaged, Dash claimed the couple had planned to marry in interviews given after Aaliyah&#x27;s death. In the summer of 2000, Aaliyah was introduced to Dash by his accountant and they formed a friendship. Aaliyah never publicly addressed their relationship as anything but platonic. Due to their hectic work schedules, Aaliyah and Dash were separated for long periods of time. Jay-Z mentioned Aaliyah and Dash in the remix of her song &quot;Miss You&quot;, released in 2003. In August 2021, Dash told &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; Kevin Frazier, &quot;I was reflecting [that] there hasn&#x27;t been one day since she&#x27;s passed, not one in the 20 years, that I haven&#x27;t either heard her name, heard her record, or seen a picture of her ... Every single day she&#x27;s present in my life and I feel lucky for that.&quot;

==Death==

On August 25, 2001, at 6:50 p.m. (EDT), Aaliyah and some employees of her record company boarded a twin-engine Cessna 402 light aircraft at the Marsh Harbour Airport in Abaco Islands, the Bahamas, to travel to Opa-Locka Airport in Florida after they completed filming the video for &quot;Rock the Boat&quot;. They had a flight scheduled the next day, but with filming finishing early, Aaliyah and her entourage were eager to return to the US and decided to leave immediately. The designated airplane was smaller than the Cessna 404 on which they had originally arrived, but the whole party and all the equipment were accommodated on board. The plane crashed and caught fire shortly after takeoff, about from the end of the runway.

Aaliyah and the eight others on board—pilot Luis Morales III, hair stylist Eric Forman, Anthony Dodd, security guard Scott Gallin, family friend Keith Wallace, make-up stylist Christopher Maldonado, and Blackground Records employees Douglas Kratz and Gina Smith—were killed.

The passengers had grown impatient because the Cessna was supposed to arrive at 4:30 pm. EDT, but did not arrive until 6:15 pm. Another charter pilot, Lewis Key, said he overheard passengers arguing with their pilot, Luis Morales, before takeoff, adding that Morales warned them that there was too much weight for a &quot;safe flight&quot;. Key added: &quot;He tried to convince them the plane was overloaded, but they insisted they had chartered the plane and they had to be in Miami Saturday night.&quot; Key indicated that Morales gave in to the passengers and that he had trouble starting one of the engines.

According to findings from an inquest conducted by the coroner&#x27;s office in the Bahamas, Aaliyah had &quot;severe burns and a blow to the head&quot; in addition to severe shock and a weak heart. The coroner theorized that she went into such a state of shock that even if she had survived the crash, her recovery would have been nearly impossible given the severity of her injuries. The bodies were taken to the morgue at Princess Margaret Hospital in Nassau, where they were kept for relatives to help identify them. Some of them were badly burned.

As the subsequent investigation determined, the aircraft was overloaded by when it attempted to take off, and was carrying one more passenger than it was certified for. The National Transportation Safety Board reported, &quot;The airplane was seen lifting off the runway, and then nose down, impacting in a marsh on the south side of the departure end of runway 27.&quot; The report indicated that the pilot was not approved to fly the plane. Morales falsely obtained his FAA license by showing hundreds of hours never flown, and he may also have falsified how many hours he had flown to get a job with his employer, Blackhawk International Airways. Additionally, toxicology tests performed on Morales revealed traces of cocaine and alcohol in his system.

===Funeral===

Aaliyah&#x27;s private funeral Mass was held on August 31, 2001, at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola in Manhattan, following a procession from the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel. Her body was set in a silver-plated copper-deposit casket, which was carried in a horse-drawn, glass hearse. An estimated 800 mourners attended the procession.

Among those in attendance at the private ceremony were Missy Elliott, Timbaland, Gladys Knight, Lil&#x27; Kim, and Sean Combs. After the service, 22 white doves were released to symbolize each year of her life.

Aaliyah&#x27;s brother Rashad delivered the eulogy and described his sister as giving him strength: &quot;Aaliyah, you left, but I&#x27;ll see you always next to me and I can see you smiling through the sunshine. When our life is over, our book is done. I hope God keeps me strong until I see her again.&quot; He read the names of the other victims of the crash and concluded by asking mourners to pray for them as well. As Diane Haughton and the mourners left, they sang Aaliyah&#x27;s song &quot;One in a Million&quot;.

==Posthumous releases==
===2001–2014: &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot;, compilations, and single releases===
Immediately after Aaliyah&#x27;s death, there was uncertainty over whether the music video for &quot;Rock the Boat&quot; would ever air. It made its world premiere on BET&#x27;s &quot;Access Granted&quot; on October 9, 2001. She won two posthumous awards at the American Music Awards of 2002; Favorite Female R&amp;B Artist and Favorite R&amp;B/Soul Album for &quot;Aaliyah&quot;. Her second and final film, &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot;, was released in February 2002. Before its release, Aaliyah&#x27;s brother, Rashad, re-dubbed some of her lines during post-production. It grossed US$15.2 million in its first weekend, ranking number one at the box office. On the first anniversary of Aaliyah&#x27;s death, a candlelight vigil was held in Times Square; millions of fans observed a moment of silence; and throughout the United States, radio stations played her music in remembrance. In December 2002, a collection of both previously unreleased and released material was issued as Aaliyah&#x27;s first posthumous album, &quot;I Care 4 U&quot;. A portion of the proceeds was donated to the Aaliyah Memorial Fund, a program that benefits the Revlon UCLA Women&#x27;s Cancer Research Program and Harlem&#x27;s Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. It debuted at number three on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 280,000 copies in its first week. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Miss You&quot;, peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and topped the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart for three weeks. In August of the following year, luxury fashion house Dior donated profits from sales in honor of Aaliyah.

In April 2005, Aaliyah&#x27;s second posthumous album, a double CD+DVD box set titled &quot;Ultimate Aaliyah&quot;, was released in the United Kingdom by Blackground Records. A documentary movie &quot;Aaliyah Live in Amsterdam&quot; was released in 2011, shortly before the tenth anniversary of Aaliyah&#x27;s death. The documentary, by Pogus Caesar, contained previously unseen footage shot of her career beginnings in 1995 when she was appearing in the Netherlands.

In March 2012, music producer Jeffrey &quot;J-Dub&quot; Walker announced that the song &quot;Steady Ground&quot;, which he produced for Aaliyah&#x27;s third album, would be included in a posthumous Aaliyah album. Aaliyah&#x27;s brother Rashad denied Walker&#x27;s claim. On August 5, 2012, Blackground Records released the track &quot;Enough Said&quot; which was produced by Noah &quot;40&quot; Shebib and features Canadian rapper Drake. Four days later, Jomo Hankerson claimed a posthumous album was being produced that would feature new production by Timbaland and Missy Elliot, who both later denied being involved with the project. The album was scheduled to be released by the end of 2012 by Blackground Records, but its release was shelved. In June 2013, Aaliyah was featured on the track &quot;Don&#x27;t Think They Know&quot; by Chris Brown, which appears on Brown&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;X&quot;. Timbaland voiced his disapproval for &quot;Enough Said&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Think They Know&quot; in July 2013, but later apologized to Chris Brown, explaining that Aaliyah and her death were a &quot;very sensitive subject&quot;.

===2015–present: Merchandise, catalog rerelease, and &quot;Unstoppable&quot;===
In May 2015, Aaliyah was featured on the Tink track &quot;Million&quot;, which contained samples from her song &quot;One in a Million&quot;. In September 2015, &quot;Aaliyah by Xyrena&quot;, an official tribute fragrance, was announced. On December 25, 2015, Timbaland released the mixtape &quot;Kings Stay Kings&quot; which includes the unreleased Aaliyah song &quot;Shakin&quot; featuring rapper Strado. In June 2018, MAC Cosmetics released a cosmetics collection inspired by Aaliyah, The Aaliyah for Mac collection which was priced at $250 and sold out within minutes. MAC and i-D Magazine partnered up to release a short film titled &quot;A-Z of Aaliyah&quot; which coincided with the launch. On August 21, 2019, the Madame Tussauds museum unveiled a wax figure of Aaliyah at their Las Vegas location, modeled on her appearance in the &quot;Try Again&quot; music video. Four days later, Aaliyah&#x27;s family announced that they were in talks with record companies to discuss the future of her discography.

In March 2021, Funko Pop! released an Aaliyah figurine. In August 2021, Blackground Records announced that Aaliyah&#x27;s recorded works would be re-released on physical, digital, and streaming services in a deal between the label and Empire Distribution. Aaliyah&#x27;s estate issued a statement in response to the announcement, denouncing the &quot;unscrupulous endeavor to release Aaliyah&#x27;s music without any transparency or full accounting to the estate&quot;. &quot;One in a Million&quot; was reissued on August 20. After the album&#x27;s re-release, &quot;One in a Million&quot; re-entered the UK Official Hip Hop and R&amp;B Albums Chart Top 40 at number eight. In the US, the album reached the top ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for the first time at number ten, selling 26,000 album-equivalent units in the week ending of August 26. &quot;Aaliyah&quot; was reissued September 10, 2021. After the album&#x27;s re-release, &quot;Aaliyah&quot; re-entered the UK Official Hip Hop and R&amp;B Albums Chart Top 40 at number seven and re-entered the US Billboard 200 chart at number 13. In celebration of the reissue, Blackground released an animated commercial titled &quot;It&#x27;s Been A Long Time&quot; (in a similar style to the album&#x27;s original 2001 commercial), directed by Takahiro Tanaka, showing Aaliyah resurrecting her music from out of a large underground vault. Compilation albums &quot;I Care 4 U&quot; and &quot;Ultimate Aaliyah&quot; were reissued October 8, 2021. &quot;Ultimate Aaliyah&quot; peaked at number 8 on the UK R&amp;B Albums Chart Top 40 and charted for the first time in the US at number 41 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

On August 25, 2021, Barry Hankerson revealed in an interview with Big Tigger for WVEE that a posthumous album titled &quot;Unstoppable&quot; would be released in &quot;a matter of weeks&quot;. The album was said to feature Drake, Snoop Dogg, Ne-Yo, Chris Brown, Future and use previously unreleased vocals from before Aaliyah&#x27;s passing. On December 17, 2021, Background Records released the posthumous Aaliyah single &quot;Poison&quot; featuring The Weeknd. On January 4, 2022, Hankerson claimed that &quot;Unstoppable&quot; would be released later that month, however, it did not see a release and there was no related announcement from the label. In January 2024, Blackground Records hinted in an Instagram post that the release was &quot;coming&quot;. 

On January 16, 2025, Mattel released an Aaliyah Barbie Doll modeled on her appearance in the &quot;One in a Million&quot; music video.

==Legacy==
Aaliyah has been credited for helping redefine R&amp;B, pop and hip hop in the 1990s, &quot;leaving an indelible imprint on the music industry as a whole.&quot; According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, she revolutionized R&amp;B with her sultry mix of pop, soul and hip hop. Peter Piatkowski from &quot;PopMatters&quot;, stated, &quot;Much like Janet Jackson&#x27;s Control set a template of sorts for dance-pop divas in the 1980s, Aaliyah&#x27;s patented brand of Black pop, which was a mélange of hip-hop, electropop, and soul, set a standard against which other young urban-pop singers were judged&quot;. In a 2001 review of her third album, Ernest Hardy from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; professed that Aaliyah&#x27;s impact on R&amp;B and pop has been enormous. Steve Huey of AllMusic wrote Aaliyah ranks among the &quot;elite&quot; artists of the R&amp;B genre, as she &quot;played a major role in popularizing the stuttering, futuristic production style that consumed hip-hop and urban soul in the late 1990s.&quot; Critic Bruce Britt stated that by combining &quot;schoolgirl charm with urban grit, Aaliyah helped define the teen-oriented sound that has resulted in contemporary pop phenom&#x27;s like Brandy, Christina Aguilera and Destiny&#x27;s Child&quot;.

Described as one of &quot;R&amp;B&#x27;s most important artists&quot; during the 1990s, her second studio album, &quot;One in a Million&quot;, became one of the most influential R&amp;B albums of the decade. Music critic Simon Reynolds cited &quot;Are You That Somebody?&quot; as &quot;the most radical pop single&quot; of 1998. Kelefah Sanneh of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that rather than being the song&#x27;s focal point, Aaliyah &quot;knew how to disappear into the music, how to match her voice to the bass line&quot;, and consequently &quot;helped change the way popular music sounds; the twitchy, beat-driven songs of Destiny&#x27;s Child owe a clear debt to &#x27;Are You That Somebody&#x27;.&quot; Sanneh asserted that by the time of her death in 2001, Aaliyah &quot;had recorded some of the most innovative and influential pop songs of the last five years.&quot; Music publication &quot;Popdust&quot; called Aaliyah an unlikely queen of the underground for her influence on the underground alternative music scene. The publication also mentioned that the forward-thinking music Aaliyah made with Timbaland and the experimental music being made by many underground alternative artists are &quot;somewhat cut from the same cloth&quot;. While compiling a list of artists that take cues from Aaliyah, MTV Hive stated that it&#x27;s easy to spot her influence on underground movements like dubstep, strains of indie pop, and lo-fi R&amp;B movements. Erika Ramirez, an associate editor of &quot;Billboard&quot;, said at the time of Aaliyah&#x27;s career &quot;there weren&#x27;t many artists using the kind of soft vocals the ways she was using it, and now you see a lot of artists doing that and finding success&quot;. Ramirez argued that Aaliyah&#x27;s second album &quot;One in a Million&quot; was &quot;very much ahead of its time, with the bass and electro kind of R&amp;B sounds that they produced&quot;, and that the sound, &quot;really stood out&quot; at its time, was being replicated.

There has been continuing belief that Aaliyah would have achieved greater career success had it not been for her death. Emil Wilbekin mentioned the deaths of The Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac Shakur in conjunction with hers and added: &quot;Her just-released third album and scheduled role in a sequel to &quot;The Matrix&quot; could have made her another Janet Jackson or Whitney Houston&quot;. Director of &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot; Michael Rymer said of Aaliyah, &quot;God, that girl could have gone so far&quot; and spoke of her having &quot;such a clarity about what she wanted. Nothing was gonna step in her way. No ego, no nervousness, no manipulation. There was nothing to stop her.&quot; On July 18, 2014, it was announced that Alexandra Shipp replaced Zendaya for the role of Aaliyah for the Lifetime TV biopic movie &quot;&quot;, which premiered on November 15, 2014. Zendaya drew criticism because people felt that she was too light skinned and did not greatly resemble Aaliyah. She voiced her strong respect for Aaliyah before dropping out of the project. She explained her choice to withdraw from the film in videos on Instagram. Aaliyah&#x27;s family has been vocal in their disapproving of the film. Her cousin Jomo Hankerson stated the family would prefer a &quot;major studio release along the lines&quot; of &quot;What&#x27;s Love Got to Do with It&quot;, the biopic based on the life of Tina Turner. Aaliyah&#x27;s family has consulted a lawyer to stop Lifetime from using &quot;any of the music, or any of the photographs and videos&quot; they own and Jomo Hankerson claimed the TV network &quot;didn&#x27;t reach out.&quot; On August 9, 2014, it was announced that Chattrisse Dolabaille and Izaak Smith had been cast as Aaliyah&#x27;s collaborators Missy Elliott and Timbaland. Dolabaille and Smith both received criticism for their appearances in comparison with that of Missy Elliot and Timbaland. Despite negative reviews, the film&#x27;s premiere drew 3.2 million viewers, becoming the second highest rated television movie of 2014.

On August 17, 2021, Atria Books (an imprint of Simon &amp; Schuster) published Kathy Iandoli&#x27;s &quot;Baby Girl: Better Known as Aaliyah&quot;, a biography that draws on interviews with Aaliyah&#x27;s friends, mentors and family, and document how her career influenced a new generation of artists. It has not been authorized by the Haughton family. On August 5, 2022, Beyoncé released &quot;The Queens Remix&quot; to her single &quot;Break My Soul&quot;, in which she name-drops Aaliyah, along with other cultural icons. On June 14, 2023, Aaliyah was the subject of the documentary &quot;Superstar: Aaliyah&quot;, which was broadcast on ABC. The documentary included interviews with Damon Dash, Barry Hankerson, Sevyn Streeter, Will.i.am, Justine Skye, and author Kathy Iandoli, and discussed Aaliyah&#x27;s life, career and legacy.

==Achievements==

Aaliyah has sold 8.1 million albums in the United States and an estimated 24 to 32 million albums worldwide. Throughout the years, she has earned several honorific nicknames, including &quot;Princess of R&amp;B&quot;, &quot;Pop Princess&quot;, and &quot;Queen of Urban Pop&quot;, 
as she &quot;proved she was a muse in her own right&quot;. While Ernest Hardy of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; dubbed her the &quot;undisputed queen of the midtempo come-on&quot;. She also has been referred to as a pop and R&amp;B icon for her impact on those genres.

At the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards, Aaliyah was honored by Janet Jackson, Missy Elliott, Timbaland, Ginuwine and her brother, Rashad, who all paid tribute to her. Also during 2001, the United States Social Security Administration ranked the name Aaliyah as one of the 100 most popular names for newborn girls. In 2003, Aaliyah was ranked as one of &quot;The Top 40 Women of the Video Era&quot; in VH1&#x27;s &quot;The Greatest&quot; series.

In 2008, she was ranked at number 18 on BET&#x27;s &quot;Top 25 Dancers of All Time&quot;. In December 2009, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked Aaliyah at number 70 on its Top Artists of the Decade, while her album &quot;Aaliyah&quot; was ranked at number 181 on the magazine&#x27;s Top 200 Albums of the Decade. In 2010, &quot;Billboard&quot; listed her as the tenth most successful female R&amp;B artist of the past 25 years, and 27th most successful R&amp;B artist overall. In 2011, Essence ranked her at number 14 on its 50 Most Influential R&amp;B Starts list. In 2012, VH1 ranked her number 48 on their &quot;Greatest Women in Music&quot;. In 2014, &quot;NME&quot; ranked her at number 18 on its 100 most influential artist list. In August 2018, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked Aaliyah at number 47 on their Top 60 Female Artists of All-Time list. In 2020, the publication included her on its list of the 100 Greatest Music Video Artists of All Time. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked her at number 40 on their 200 Best Singers of All Time list. In September 2023, she was inducted into the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame.

<text>Armour (Commonwealth English) or armor (American English; see spelling differences) is a covering used to protect an object, individual, or vehicle from physical injury or damage, especially direct contact weapons or projectiles during combat, or from a potentially dangerous environment or activity (e.g. cycling, construction sites, etc.). Personal armour is used to protect soldiers and war animals. Vehicle armour is used on warships, armoured fighting vehicles, and some combat aircraft, mostly ground attack aircraft.

A second use of the term &quot;armour&quot; describes armoured forces, armoured weapons, and their role in combat. After the development of armoured warfare, tanks and mechanised infantry and their combat formations came to be referred to collectively as &quot;armour&quot;.

== Etymology ==

The word &quot;armour&quot; began to appear in the Middle Ages as a derivative of Old French. It is dated from 1297 as a &quot;mail, defensive covering worn in combat&quot;. The word originates from the Old French , itself derived from the Latin meaning &quot;arms and/or equipment&quot;, with the root meaning &quot;arms or gear&quot;.

== Personal ==

Armour has been used throughout recorded history. It has been made from a variety of materials, beginning with the use of leathers or fabrics as protection and evolving through chain mail and metal plate into today&#x27;s modern composites. For much of military history the manufacture of metal personal armour has dominated the technology and employment of armour.

Armour drove the development of many important technologies of the Ancient World, including wood lamination, mining, metal refining, vehicle manufacture, leather processing, and later decorative metal working. Its production was influential in the Industrial Revolution, and furthered commercial development of metallurgy and engineering. Armour was also an important factor in the development of firearms, which in turn revolutionised warfare.

=== History ===

Significant factors in the development of armour include the economic and technological necessities of its production. For instance, plate armour first appeared in Medieval Europe when water-powered trip hammers made the formation of plates faster and cheaper. At times the development of armour has paralleled the development of increasingly effective weaponry on the battlefield, with armourers seeking to create better protection without sacrificing mobility.

Well-known armour types in European history include the lorica hamata, lorica squamata, and the lorica segmentata of the Roman legions, the mail hauberk of the early medieval age, and the full steel plate harness worn by later medieval and renaissance knights, and breast and back plates worn by heavy cavalry in several European countries until the first year of World War I (1914–1915). The samurai warriors of Feudal Japan utilised many types of armour for hundreds of years up to the 19th century.

==== Early ====

The first record of body armor in history was found on the Stele of Vultures in ancient Sumer in today&#x27;s south Iraq, and various forms of scale mail can be seen in surviving records from the New Kingdom of Egypt, Zhou dynasty China, and dynastic India. Cuirasses and helmets were manufactured in Japan as early as the 4th century. &quot;Tankō&quot;, worn by foot soldiers and &quot;keikō&quot;, worn by horsemen were both pre-samurai types of early Japanese armour constructed from iron plates connected together by leather thongs. Japanese lamellar armour (&quot;keiko&quot;) passed through Korea and reached Japan around the 5th century. These early Japanese lamellar armours took the form of a sleeveless jacket, leggings and a helmet.

Armour did not always cover all of the body; sometimes no more than a helmet and leg plates were worn. The rest of the body was generally protected by means of a large shield. An example of armies equipping their troops in this fashion were the Aztecs (13th to 15th century CE).

In East Asia, many types of armour were commonly used at different times by various cultures, including scale armour, lamellar armour, laminar armour, plated mail, mail, plate armour, and brigandine. Around the dynastic Tang, Song, and early Ming Period, cuirasses and plates (mingguangjia) were also used, with more elaborate versions for officers in war. The Chinese, during that time used partial plates for &quot;important&quot; body parts instead of covering their whole body since too much plate armour hinders their martial arts movement. The other body parts were covered in cloth, leather, lamellar, or mountain pattern armor. In pre-Qin dynasty times, leather armour was made out of various animals, with more exotic ones such as the rhinoceros.

Mail, sometimes called &quot;chainmail&quot;, made of interlocking iron rings is believed to have first appeared some time after 300 BC. Its invention is credited to the Celts; the Romans are thought to have adopted their design.

Gradually, small additional plates or discs of iron were added to the mail to protect vulnerable areas. Hardened leather and splinted construction were used for arm and leg pieces. The coat of plates was developed, an armour made of large plates sewn inside a textile or leather coat.

==== 13th to 18th century Europe ====
Early plate in Italy, and elsewhere in the 13th–15th century, were made of iron. Iron armour could be carburised or case hardened to give a surface of harder steel. Plate armour became cheaper than mail by the 15th century as it required much less labour and labour had become much more expensive after the Black Death, though it did require larger furnaces to produce larger blooms. Mail continued to be used to protect those joints which could not be adequately protected by plate, such as the armpit, crook of the elbow and groin. Another advantage of plate was that a lance rest could be fitted to the breast plate.

The small skull cap evolved into a bigger true helmet, the bascinet, as it was lengthened downward to protect the back of the neck and the sides of the head. Additionally, several new forms of fully enclosed helmets were introduced in the late 14th century.
Probably the most recognised style of armour in the world became the plate armour associated with the knights of the European Late Middle Ages, but continuing to the early 17th century Age of Enlightenment in all European countries.

By 1400, the full harness of plate armour had been developed in armouries of Lombardy. Heavy cavalry dominated the battlefield for centuries in part because of their armour.

In the early 15th century, advances in weaponry allowed infantry to defeat armoured knights on the battlefield. The quality of the metal used in armour deteriorated as armies became bigger and armour was made thicker, necessitating breeding of larger cavalry horses. If during the 14–15th centuries armour seldom weighed more than 15 kg, then by the late 16th century it weighed 25 kg. The increasing weight and thickness of late 16th century armour therefore gave substantial resistance.

In the early years of low velocity firearms, full suits of armour, or breast plates actually stopped bullets fired from a modest distance. Crossbow bolts, if still in use, would seldom penetrate good plate, nor would any bullet unless fired from close range. In effect, rather than making plate armour obsolete, the use of firearms stimulated the development of plate armour into its later stages. For most of that period, it allowed horsemen to fight while being the targets of defending arquebusiers without being easily killed. Full suits of armour were actually worn by generals and princely commanders right up to the second decade of the 18th century. It was the only way they could be mounted and survey the overall battlefield with safety from distant musket fire.

The horse was afforded protection from lances and infantry weapons by steel plate barding. This gave the horse protection and enhanced the visual impression of a mounted knight. Late in the era, elaborate barding was used in parade armour.

==== Later ====

Gradually, starting in the mid-16th century, one plate element after another was discarded to save weight for foot soldiers.

Back and breast plates continued to be used throughout the entire period of the 18th century and through Napoleonic times, in many European heavy cavalry units, until the early 20th century. From their introduction, muskets could pierce plate armour, so cavalry had to be far more mindful of the fire. In Japan, armour continued to be used until the late 19th century, with the last major fighting in which armour was used, this occurred in 1868. Samurai armour had one last short lived use in 1877 during the Satsuma Rebellion.

Though the age of the knight was over, armour continued to be used in many capacities. Soldiers in the American Civil War bought iron and steel vests from peddlers (both sides had considered but rejected body armour for standard issue). The effectiveness of the vests varied widely, some successfully deflected bullets and saved lives, but others were poorly made and resulted in tragedy for the soldiers. In any case the vests were abandoned by many soldiers due to their increased weight on long marches, as well as the stigma they got for being cowards from their fellow troops.

At the start of World War I, thousands of the French Cuirassiers rode out to engage the German Cavalry. By that period, the shiny metallic cuirass was covered in a dark paint and a canvas wrap covered their elaborate Napoleonic style helmets, to help mitigate the sunlight being reflected off the surfaces, thereby alerting the enemy of their location. Their armour was only meant for protection against edged weapons such as bayonets, sabres, and lances. Cavalry had to be wary of repeating rifles, machine guns, and artillery, unlike the foot soldiers, who at least had a trench to give them some protection.

=== Present ===
Today, ballistic vests, also known as flak jackets, made of ballistic cloth (e.g. kevlar, dyneema, twaron, spectra etc.) and ceramic or metal plates are common among police officers, security guards, corrections officers and some branches of the military.

The US Army has adopted Interceptor body armour, which uses Enhanced Small Arms Protective Inserts (ESAPIs) in the chest, sides, and back of the armour. Each plate is rated to stop a range of ammunition including 3 hits from a 7.62×51 NATO AP round at a range of . Dragon Skin is another ballistic vest which is currently in testing with mixed results. As of 2019, it has been deemed too heavy, expensive, and unreliable, in comparison to more traditional plates, and it is outdated in protection compared to modern US IOTV armour, and even in testing was deemed a downgrade from the IBA.

The British Armed Forces also have their own armour, known as Osprey. It is rated to the same general equivalent standard as the US counterpart, the Improved Outer Tactical Vest, and now the Soldier Plate Carrier System and Modular Tactical Vest.

The Russian Armed Forces also have armour, known as the 6B43, all the way to 6B45, depending on variant. Their armour runs on the GOST system, which, due to regional conditions, has resulted in a technically higher protective level overall.

== Vehicle ==
The first modern production technology for armour plating was used by navies in the construction of the ironclad warship, reaching its pinnacle of development with the battleship. The first tanks were produced during World War I. Aerial armour has been used to protect pilots and aircraft systems since the First World War.

In modern ground forces&#x27; usage, the meaning of armour has expanded to include the role of troops in combat. After the evolution of armoured warfare, mechanised infantry were mounted in armoured fighting vehicles and replaced light infantry in many situations. In modern armoured warfare, armoured units equipped with tanks and infantry fighting vehicles serve the historic role of heavy cavalry, light cavalry, and dragoons, and belong to the armoured branch of warfare.

=== History ===

==== Ships ====

The first ironclad battleship, with iron armour over a wooden hull, , was launched by the French Navy in 1859 prompting the British Royal Navy to build a counter. The following year they launched , which was twice the size and had iron armour over an iron hull. After the first battle between two ironclads took place in 1862 during the American Civil War, it became clear that the ironclad had replaced the unarmoured line-of-battle ship as the most powerful warship afloat.

Ironclads were designed for several roles, including as high seas battleships, coastal defence ships, and long-range cruisers. The rapid evolution of warship design in the late 19th century transformed the ironclad from a wooden-hulled vessel which carried sails to supplement its steam engines into the steel-built, turreted battleships and cruisers familiar in the 20th century. This change was pushed forward by the development of heavier naval guns (the ironclads of the 1880s carried some of the heaviest guns ever mounted at sea), more sophisticated steam engines, and advances in metallurgy which made steel shipbuilding possible.

The rapid pace of change in the ironclad period meant that many ships were obsolete as soon as they were complete, and that naval tactics were in a state of flux. Many ironclads were built to make use of the ram or the torpedo, which a number of naval designers considered the crucial weapons of naval combat. There is no clear end to the ironclad period, but towards the end of the 1890s the term &quot;ironclad&quot; dropped out of use. New ships were increasingly constructed to a standard pattern and designated battleships or armoured cruisers.

==== Trains ====
Armoured trains saw use from the mid-19th to the mid-20th century, including the American Civil War (1861–1865), the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871), the First and Second Boer Wars (1880–81 and 1899–1902), the Polish–Soviet War (1919–1921), the First (1914–1918) and Second World Wars (1939–1945) and the First Indochina War (1946–1954). The most intensive use of armoured trains was during the Russian Civil War (1918–1920).

==== Armoured fighting vehicles ====
Ancient siege engines were usually protected by wooden armour, often covered with wet hides or thin metal to prevent being easily burned.

Medieval war wagons were horse-drawn wagons that were similarly armoured. These contained guns or crossbowmen that could fire through gun-slits.

The first modern armoured fighting vehicles were armoured cars, developed . These started as ordinary wheeled motor-cars protected by iron shields, typically mounting a machine gun.

During the First World War, the stalemate of trench warfare during on the Western Front spurred the development of the tank. It was envisioned as an armoured machine that could advance under fire from enemy rifles and machine guns, and respond with its own heavy guns. It used caterpillar tracks to cross ground broken up by shellfire and trenches.

==== Aircraft ====
With the development of effective anti-aircraft artillery in the period before the Second World War, military pilots, once the &quot;knights of the air&quot; during the First World War, became far more vulnerable to ground fire. As a response, armour plating was added to aircraft to protect aircrew and vulnerable areas such as engines and fuel tanks. Self-sealing fuel tanks functioned like armour in that they added protection but also increased weight and cost.

=== Present ===
Tank armour has progressed from the Second World War armour forms, now incorporating not only harder composites, but also reactive armour designed to defeat shaped charges. As a result of this, the main battle tank (MBT) conceived in the Cold War era can survive multiple rocket-propelled grenade strikes with minimal effect on the crew or the operation of the vehicle. The light tanks that were the last descendants of the light cavalry during the Second World War have almost completely disappeared from the world&#x27;s militaries due to increased lethality of the weapons available to the vehicle-mounted infantry.

The armoured personnel carrier (APC) was devised during the First World War. It allows the safe and rapid movement of infantry in a combat zone, minimising casualties and maximising mobility. APCs are fundamentally different from the previously used armoured half-tracks in that they offer a higher level of protection from artillery burst fragments, and greater mobility in more terrain types. The basic APC design was substantially expanded to an infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) when properties of an APC and a light tank were combined in one vehicle.

Naval armour has fundamentally changed from the Second World War doctrine of thicker plating to defend against shells, bombs and torpedoes. Passive defence naval armour is limited to kevlar or steel (either single layer or as spaced armour) protecting particularly vital areas from the effects of nearby impacts. Since ships cannot carry enough armour to completely protect against anti-ship missiles, they depend more on defensive weapons destroying incoming missiles, or causing them to miss by confusing their guidance systems with electronic warfare.

Although the role of the ground attack aircraft significantly diminished after the Korean War, it re-emerged during the Vietnam War, and in the recognition of this, the US Air Force authorised the design and production of what became the A-10 dedicated anti-armour and ground-attack aircraft that first saw action in the Gulf War.

High-voltage transformer fire barriers are often required to defeat ballistics from small arms as well as projectiles from transformer bushings and lightning arresters, which form part of large electrical transformers, per NFPA 850. Such fire barriers may be designed to inherently function as armour, or may be passive fire protection materials &quot;augmented by armour&quot;, where care must be taken to ensure that the armour&#x27;s reaction to fire does not cause issues with regards to the fire barrier being armoured to defeat explosions and projectiles in addition to fire, especially since both functions must be provided simultaneously, meaning they must be fire-tested together to provide realistic evidence of fitness for purpose.

Combat drones use little to no vehicular armour as they are not crewed vessels, this results in them being lightweight and small in size.

== Animal armour ==

=== Horse armour ===

Body armour for war horses has been used since at least 2000 BC. Cloth, leather, and metal protection covered cavalry horses in ancient civilisations, including ancient Egypt, Assyria, Persia, and Rome. Some formed heavy cavalry units of armoured horses and riders used to attack infantry and mounted archers. Armour for horses is called &quot;barding&quot; (also spelled &quot;bard&quot; or &quot;barb&quot;) especially when used by European knights.

During the late Middle Ages as armour protection for knights became more effective, their mounts became targets. This vulnerability was exploited by the Scots at the Battle of Bannockburn in the 14th century, when horses were killed by the infantry, and for the English at the Battle of Crécy in the same century where longbowmen shot horses and the then dismounted French knights were killed by heavy infantry. Barding developed as a response to such events.

Examples of armour for horses could be found as far back as classical antiquity. Cataphracts, with scale armour for both rider and horse, are believed by many historians to have influenced the later European knights, via contact with the Byzantine Empire.

Surviving period examples of barding are rare; however, complete sets are on display at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Wallace Collection in London, the Royal Armouries in Leeds, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Horse armour could be made in whole or in part of cuir bouilli (hardened leather), but surviving examples of this are especially rare.

=== Elephant armour ===

War elephants were first used in ancient times without armour, but armour was introduced because elephants injured by enemy weapons would often flee the battlefield. Elephant armour was often made from hardened leather, which was fitted onto an individual elephant while moist, then dried to create a hardened shell. Alternatively, metal armour pieces were sometimes sewn into heavy cloth. Later lamellar armour (small overlapping metal plates) was introduced. Full plate armour was not typically used due to its expense and the danger of the animal overheating.

<text>An armoured fighting vehicle (British English) or armored fighting vehicle (American English) (AFV) is an armed combat vehicle protected by armour, generally combining operational mobility with offensive and defensive capabilities. AFVs can be wheeled or tracked. Examples of AFVs are tanks, armoured cars, assault guns, self-propelled artilleries, infantry fighting vehicles (IFV), and armoured personnel carriers (APC).

Armoured fighting vehicles are classified according to their characteristics and intended role on the battlefield. The classifications are not absolute; two countries may classify the same vehicle differently, and the criteria change over time. For example, relatively lightly armed armoured personnel carriers were largely superseded by infantry fighting vehicles with much heavier armament in a similar role.

Successful designs are often adapted to a wide variety of applications. For example, the MOWAG Piranha, originally designed as an APC, has been adapted to fill numerous roles such as a mortar carrier, infantry fighting vehicle, and assault gun.

Armoured fighting vehicles began to appear in use in World War I with the armoured car, the tank, the self-propelled gun, and the personnel carrier seeing use. By World War II, armies had large numbers of AFVs, together with other vehicles to carry troops this permitted highly mobile manoeuvre warfare.

== Evolution ==
The concept of a highly mobile and protected fighting unit has been around for centuries; from Hannibal&#x27;s war elephants to Leonardo&#x27;s contraptions, military strategists endeavoured to maximize the mobility and survivability of their soldiers.

Armoured fighting vehicles were not possible until internal combustion engines of sufficient power became available at the start of the 20th century.

=== History ===
====Pre-modern====

Modern armoured fighting vehicles represent the realization of an ancient concept – that of providing troops with mobile protection and firepower. Armies have deployed war machines and cavalries with rudimentary armour in battle for millennia. Use of these animals and engineering designs sought to achieve a balance between the conflicting paradoxical needs of mobility, firepower and protection.

===== Siege machine =====

Siege engines, such as battering rams and siege towers, would often be armoured in order to protect their crews from enemy action. Polyidus of Thessaly developed a very large movable siege tower, the &quot;helepolis&quot;, as early as 340 BC, and Greek forces used such structures in the Siege of Rhodes (305 BC).

The idea of a protected fighting vehicle has been known since antiquity. Frequently cited is Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s 15th-century sketch of a mobile, protected gun-platform; the drawings show a conical, wooden shelter with apertures for cannons around the circumference. The machine was to be mounted on four wheels which would be turned by the crew through a system of hand cranks and cage (or &quot;lantern&quot;) gears. Leonardo claimed: &quot;I will build armoured wagons which will be safe and invulnerable to enemy attacks. There will be no obstacle which it cannot overcome.&quot; Modern replicas have demonstrated that the human crew would have been able to move it over only short distances.

===== War wagon =====
Hussite forces in Bohemia developed war wagons – medieval horse-drawn wagons that doubled as wagon forts – around 1420 during the Hussite Wars. These heavy wagons were given protective sides with firing slits; their heavy firepower came from either a cannon or from a force of hand-gunners and crossbowmen, supported by light cavalry and infantry using pikes and flails. Heavy arquebuses mounted on wagons were called &quot;arquebus à croc&quot;. These carried a ball of about . 

====Modern====
By the end of World War II, most modern armies had vehicles to carry infantry, artillery and anti-aircraft weaponry. Most modern AFVs are superficially similar in design to their World War II counterparts, but with significantly better armour, weapons, engines, electronics, and suspension. The increase in the capacity of transport aircraft makes possible and practicable the transport of AFVs by air. Many armies are replacing some or all of their traditional heavy vehicles with lighter airmobile versions, often with wheels instead of tracks.

===== Armed and armoured car =====
The first modern AFVs were armed cars, dating back virtually to the invention of the motor car. The British inventor F. R. Simms designed and built the Motor Scout in 1898. It was the first armed, petrol-engine powered vehicle ever built. It consisted of a De Dion-Bouton quadracycle with a Maxim machine gun mounted on the front bar. An iron shield offered some protection for the driver from the front, but it lacked all-around protective armour.

The armoured car was the first modern fully armoured fighting vehicle. The first of these was the Simms&#x27;s Motor War Car, also designed by Simms and built by Vickers, Sons &amp; Maxim in 1899. The vehicle had Vickers armour 6 mm thick and was powered by a four-cylinder 3.3-litre 16 hp Cannstatt Daimler engine giving it a maximum speed of around . The armament, consisting of two Maxim guns, was carried in two turrets with 360° traverse.
Another early armoured car of the period was the French Charron, Girardot et Voigt 1902, presented at the &quot;Salon de l&#x27;Automobile et du cycle&quot; in Brussels, on 8 March 1902. The vehicle was equipped with a Hotchkiss machine gun, and with 7 mm armour for the gunner. Armoured cars were first used in large numbers on both sides during World War I as scouting vehicles.

===== Tank =====

In 1903, H. G. Wells published the short story &quot;The Land Ironclads,&quot; positing indomitable war machines that would bring a new age of land warfare, the way steam-powered ironclad warships had ended the age of sail.

Wells&#x27;s literary vision was realized in 1916, when, amidst the pyrrhic standstill of the Great War, the British Landship Committee deployed revolutionary armoured vehicles to break the stalemate. The tank was envisioned as an armoured machine that could cross ground under fire from machine guns and reply with its own mounted machine guns and naval artillery. These first British tanks of World War I moved on caterpillar tracks that had substantially lower ground pressure than wheeled vehicles, enabling them to pass the muddy, pocked terrain and slit trenches of the Battle of the Somme.

===== Troop transport =====

The tank eventually proved highly successful and, as technology improved, it became a weapon that could cross large distances at much higher speeds than supporting infantry and artillery. The need to provide the units that would fight alongside the tank led to the development of a wide range of specialised AFVs, especially during the Second World War (1939–1945).

The armoured personnel carrier, designed to transport infantry troops to the frontline, emerged towards the end of World War I. During the first actions with tanks, it had become clear that close contact with infantry was essential in order to secure ground won by the tanks. Troops on foot were vulnerable to enemy fire, but they could not be transported in the tank because of the intense heat and noxious atmosphere. In 1917, Lieutenant G. J. Rackham was ordered to design an armoured vehicle that could fight and carry troops or supplies. The Mark IX tank was built by Armstrong, Whitworth &amp; Co., although just three vehicles had been finished at the time of the Armistice in November 1918, and only 34 were built in total.

===== Tankette =====

Different tank classifications emerged in the interwar period. The tankette was conceived as a mobile, two-man model, mainly intended for reconnaissance. In 1925, Sir John Carden and Vivian Loyd produced the first such design to be adopted – the Carden Loyd tankette. Tankettes saw use in the Royal Italian Army during the Italian invasion of Ethiopia (1935–1936), the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), and during World War II. The Imperial Japanese Army used tankettes in China for infantry support, reconnaissance and later for jungle warfare.

===== Self-propelled artillery =====

The British Gun Carrier Mark I, the first Self-propelled artillery, was fielded in 1917. It was based on the first tank, the British Mark I, and carried a heavy field-gun. The next major advance was the Birch gun (1925), developed for the British motorised warfare experimental brigade (the Experimental Mechanized Force). This mounted a field gun, capable of the usual artillery trajectories and even anti-aircraft use, on a tank chassis.

During World War II, most major military powers developed self-propelled artillery vehicles. These had guns mounted on a tracked chassis (often that of an obsolete or superseded tank) and provided an armoured superstructure to protect the gun and its crew. The first British design, &quot;Bishop&quot;, carried the 25 pdr gun-howitzer in an extemporised mounting on a tank chassis that severely limited the gun&#x27;s performance. It was replaced by the more effective Sexton. The Germans built many lightly armoured self-propelled anti-tank guns using captured French equipment (for example Marder I), their own obsolete light tank chassis (Marder II), or ex-Czech chassis (Marder III). These led to better-protected tank destroyers, built on a medium-tank chassis such as the Jagdpanzer IV or the Jagdpanther.

===== Anti-aircraft vehicle =====
The Self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon debuted in WWI. The German 88 mm anti-aircraft gun was truck-mounted and used to great effect against British tanks, and the British QF 3-inch 20 cwt was mounted on trucks for use on the Western Front. Although the Birch gun was a general purpose artillery piece on an armoured tracked chassis, it was capable of elevation for anti-aircraft use. Vickers Armstrong developed one of the first SPAAGs based on the chassis of the Mk.E 6-ton light tank/Dragon Medium Mark IV tractor, mounting a Vickers QF-1 &quot;Pom-Pom&quot; gun of 40 mm. The Germans fielded the Sd.Kfz. 10/4 and 6/2, cargo halftracks mounting single 20 mm or 37 mm AA guns (respectively) by the start of the war.

===== Self-propelled multiple rocket-launcher =====
Rocket launchers such as the Soviet Katyusha originated in the late 1930s. The Wehrmacht fielded self-propelled rocket artillery in World War II – the Panzerwerfer and Wurfrahmen 40 equipped half-track armoured fighting vehicles. Many modern multiple rocket launchers are self propelled by either truck or tank chassis.

=== Design ===
==== Survivability ====
The level of armour protection between AFVs varies greatly – a main battle tank will normally be designed to take hits from other tank guns and anti-tank missiles, whilst light reconnaissance vehicles are often only armoured &quot;just in case&quot;. Whilst heavier armour provides better protection, it makes vehicles less mobile (for a given engine power), limits its air-transportability, increases cost, uses more fuel and may limit the places it can go – for example, many bridges may be unable to support the weight of a main battle tank. A trend toward composite armour is taking the place of steel – composites are stronger for a given weight, allowing the tank to be lighter for the same protection as steel armour, or better protected for the same weight. Armour is being supplemented with active protection systems on a number of vehicles, allowing the AFV to protect itself from incoming projectiles.
The level of protection also usually varies considerably throughout the individual vehicle too, depending on the role of the vehicle and the likely direction of attack. For example, a main battle tank will usually have the heaviest armour on the hull front and the turret, lighter armour on the sides of the hull and the thinnest armour on the top and bottom of the tank. Other vehicles – such as the MRAP family – may be primarily armoured against the threat from IEDs and so will have heavy, sloped armour on the bottom of the hull.

==== Firepower ====
Weaponry varies by a very wide degree between AFVs – lighter vehicles for infantry carrying, reconnaissance or specialist roles may have only a autocannon or machine gun (or no armament at all), whereas heavy self-propelled artillery will carry howitzers, mortars or rocket launchers. These weapons may be mounted on a pintle, affixed directly to the vehicle or placed in a turret or cupola.

The greater the recoil of the weapon on an AFV, the larger the turret ring needs to be. A larger turret ring necessitates a larger vehicle. To avoid listing to the side, turrets on amphibious vehicles are usually located at the centre of the vehicle.

Grenade launchers provide a versatile launch platform for a plethora of munitions including, smoke, phosphorus, tear gas, illumination, anti-personnel, infrared and radar-jamming rounds.

Turret stabilization is an important capability because it enables firing on the move and prevents crew fatigue.

==== Maneuverability ====

Modern AFVs have primarily used either petrol (gasoline) or diesel piston engines. More recently, gas turbines have been used. Most early AFVs used petrol engines, as they offer a good power-to-weight ratio. However, they fell out of favour during World War II due to the flammability of the fuel.

Most current AFVs are powered by a diesel engine; modern technology, including the use of turbo-charging, helps to overcome the lower power-to-weight ratio of diesel engines compared to petrol.

Gas turbine (turboshaft) engines offer a very high power-to-weight ratio and were starting to find favour in the late 20th century – however, they offer very poor fuel consumption and as such some armies are switching from gas turbines back to diesel engines (i.e. the Russian T-80 used a gas turbine engine, whereas the later T-90 does not). The US M1 Abrams is a notable example of a gas turbine powered tank.

== Modern classification by type and role ==
Notable armoured fighting vehicles extending from post-World War I to today.

=== Tank ===

The tank is an all terrain AFV incorporating artillery which is designed to fill almost all battlefield roles and to engage enemy forces by the use of direct fire in the frontal assault role. Though several configurations have been tried, particularly in the early experimental &quot;golden days&quot; of tank development, a standard, mature design configuration has since emerged to a generally accepted pattern. This features a main tank gun or artillery gun, mounted in a fully rotating turret atop a tracked automotive hull, with various additional secondary weapon systems throughout.

Philosophically, the tank is, by its very nature, an offensive weapon. Being a protective encasement with at least one gun position, it is essentially a pillbox or small fortress (though these are static fortifications of a purely defensive nature) that can move toward the enemy – hence its offensive utility. Psychologically, the tank is a force multiplier that has a positive morale effect on the infantry it accompanies. It also instills fear in the opposing force who can often hear and even feel their arrival.

==== Tank classifications ====
Tanks were classified either by size or by role.
Classification by relative size was common, as this also tended to influence the tanks&#x27; role.
* Light tanks are smaller tanks with thinner armour and lower-powered guns, allowing for better tactical mobility and ease of strategic transport. These are intended for armoured reconnaissance, skirmishing, artillery observation, expeditionary warfare and supplementing airborne or naval landings. Light tanks are typically cheaper to build and maintain, but fare poorly against heavier tanks. They may be held in reserve for exploiting any breakthroughs in enemy lines, with the goal of disrupting communications and supply lines.
* Medium tanks are mid-sized tanks with adequate armour and guns, and fair mobility, allowing for a balance of fighting abilities, mobility, cost-effectiveness, and transportability. Medium tanks are effective in groups when used against enemy tanks.
* Heavy tanks are larger tanks with thick armour and more powerful guns, but less mobile and more difficult to transport. They were intended to be more than a match for typical enemy medium tanks, easily penetrating their armour while being much less susceptible to their attacks. Heavy tanks cost more to both build and maintain, and their heavy armour proved most effective when deployed in support infantry assaulting entrenched fortifications.

Over time, tanks tended to be designed with heavier armour and weapons, increasing the weight of all tanks, so these classifications are relative to the average for the nation&#x27;s tanks for any given period. An older tank design might be reclassified over time, such as a tank being first deployed as a medium tank, but in later years relegated to light tank roles.

Tanks were also classified by roles that were independent of size, such as cavalry tank, cruiser tank, fast tank, infantry tank, &quot;assault&quot; tank, or &quot;breakthrough&quot; tank. Military theorists initially tended to assign tanks to traditional military infantry, cavalry, and artillery roles, but later developed more specialized roles unique to tanks.

In modern use, the heavy tank has fallen out of favour, being supplanted by more heavily armed and armoured descendant of the medium tanks – the universal main battle tank. The light tank has, in many armies, lost favour to cheaper, faster, lighter armoured cars; however, light tanks (or similar vehicles with other names) are still in service with a number of forces as reconnaissance vehicles, most notably the Russian Marines with the PT-76, the British Army with the Scimitar, and the Chinese Army with the Type 63.
==== Main battle tank ====


Modern main battle tanks or &quot;universal tanks&quot; incorporate recent advances in automotive, artillery, armour, and electronic technology to combine the best characteristics of the historic medium and heavy tanks into a single, all-around type. They are also the most expensive to mass-produce. A main battle tank is distinguished by its high level of firepower, mobility and armour protection relative to other vehicles of its era. It can cross comparatively rough terrain at high speeds, but its heavy dependency on fuel, maintenance, and ammunition makes it logistically demanding. It has the heaviest armour of any AFVs on the battlefield, and carries a powerful precision-guided munition weapon systems that may be able to engage a wide variety of both ground targets and air targets. Despite significant advances in anti-tank warfare, it still remains the most versatile and fearsome land-based weapon-systems of the 21st-century, valued for its shock action and high survivability.
==== Tankette ====

A tankette is a tracked armed and armoured vehicle resembling a small &quot;ultra-light tank&quot; or &quot;super-light tank&quot; roughly the size of a car, mainly intended for light infantry support or scouting. Tankettes were introduced in the mid-1920s as a reconnaissance vehicle and a mobile machine gun position They were one or two-man vehicles armed with a machine gun. Colloquially it may also simply mean a &quot;small tank&quot;.

Tankettes were designed and built by several nations between the 1920s and 1940s following the British Carden Loyd tankette which was a successful implementation of &quot;one man tank&quot; ideas from Giffard Le Quesne Martel, a British Army engineer. They were very popular with smaller countries. Some saw some combat (with limited success) in World War II. However, the vulnerability of their light armour eventually caused the concept to be abandoned. However, the German Army uses a modern design of air-transportable armoured weapons carriers, the Wiesel AWC, which resembles the concept of a tankette.

==== &quot;Super&quot;-heavy tank ====

The term &quot;super-heavy tank&quot; has been used to describe armoured fighting vehicles of extreme size, generally over 75 tonnes. Programs have been initiated on several occasions with the aim of creating an invincible siegeworks/breakthrough vehicle for penetrating enemy formations and fortifications without fear of being destroyed in combat. Examples were designed in World War I and World War II (such as the Panzer VIII Maus), along with a few in the Cold War. However, few working prototypes were built and there is no clear evidence any of these vehicles saw combat, as their immense size would have made most designs impractical.

==== Missile tank ====

A missile tank is a tank fulfilling the role of a main battle tank, but using only anti-tank surface-to-surface missiles for main armament. Several nations have experimented with prototypes, notably the Soviet Union during the tenure of Nikita Khrushchev (projects Object 167, Object 137Ml, Object 155Ml, Object 287, Object 775),
==== Flame tank ====
A flame tank is an otherwise-standard tank equipped with a flamethrower, most commonly used to supplement combined arms attacks against fortifications, confined spaces, or other obstacles. The type only reached significant use in the Second World War, during which the United States, Soviet Union, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom (including members of the British Commonwealth) all produced flamethrower-equipped tanks. Usually, the flame projector replaced one of the tank&#x27;s machineguns, however, some flame projectors replaced the tank&#x27;s main gun. Fuel for the flame weapon was generally carried inside the tank, although a few designs mounted the fuel externally, such as the armoured trailer used on the Churchill Crocodile.

Flame tanks have been superseded by thermobaric weapons such as the Russian TOS-1.
==== Infantry tank ====
The idea for this tank was developed during World War I by British and French. The infantry tank was designed to work in concert with infantry in the assault, moving mostly at a walking pace, and carrying heavy armour to survive defensive fire. Its main purpose was to suppress enemy fire, crush obstacles such as barbed-wire entanglements, and protect the infantry on their advance into and through enemy lines by giving mobile overwatch and cover. The French Renault FT was the first iteration of this concept.

The British and French retained the concept between the wars and into the Second World War era. Because infantry tanks did not need to be fast, they could carry heavy armour. One of the best-known infantry tanks was the Matilda II of World War II. Other examples include the French R-35, the British Valentine, and the British Churchill.

==== Cruiser tank ====
A cruiser tank, or cavalry tank, was designed to move fast and exploit penetrations of the enemy front. The idea originated in &quot;Plan 1919&quot;, a British plan to break the trench deadlock of World War I in part via the use of high-speed tanks. The first cruiser tank was the British Whippet.

Between the wars, this concept was implemented in the &quot;fast tanks&quot; pioneered by J. Walter Christie. These led to the Soviet BT tank series and the British cruiser tank series.

During World War II, British cruiser tanks were designed to complement infantry tanks, exploiting gains made by the latter to attack and disrupt the enemy rear areas. In order to give them the required speed, cruiser designs sacrificed armour and armament compared to the infantry tanks. Pure British cruisers were generally replaced by more capable medium tanks such as the US Sherman and, to a lesser extent, the Cromwell by 1943.

The Soviet fast tank (&quot;bistrokhodniy tank&quot;, or BT tank) classification also came out of the infantry/cavalry concept of armoured warfare and formed the basis for the British cruisers after 1936. The T-34 was a development of this line of tanks as well, though their armament, armour, and all-round capability places them firmly in the medium tank category.
=== Armoured car ===

The armoured car is a wheeled, often lightly armoured, vehicle adapted as a fighting machine. Its earliest form consisted of a motorised ironside chassis fitted with firing ports. By World War I, this had evolved into a mobile fortress equipped with command equipment, searchlights, and machine guns for self-defence. It was soon proposed that the requirements for the armament and layout of armoured cars be somewhat similar to those on naval craft, resulting in turreted vehicles. The first example carried a single revolving cupola with a Vickers gun; modern armoured cars may boast heavier armament – ranging from twin machine guns to large calibre cannon.

Some multi-axled wheeled fighting vehicles can be quite heavy, and superior to older or smaller tanks in terms of armour and armament. Others are often used in military marches and processions, or for the escorting of important figures. Under peacetime conditions, they form an essential part of most standing armies. Armoured car units can move without the assistance of transporters and cover great distances with fewer logistical problems than tracked vehicles.

During World War II, armoured cars were used for reconnaissance alongside scout cars. Their guns were suitable for some defence if they encountered enemy armoured fighting vehicles, but they were not intended to engage enemy tanks. Armoured cars have since been used in the offensive role against tanks with varying degrees of success, most notably during the South African Border War, Toyota War, the Invasion of Kuwait, and other lower-intensity conflicts.

==== Aerosledge ====
An &quot;aerosledge&quot; is a type of propeller-driven snowmobile, running on skis, used for communications, mail deliveries, medical aid, emergency recovery and border patrolling in northern Russia, as well as for recreation. Aerosledges were used by the Soviet Red Army during the Winter War and World War II.

Some early aerosledges were built by young Igor Sikorsky in 1909–10, before he built multi-engine airplanes and helicopters. They were very light plywood vehicles on skis, propelled by old airplane engines and propellers.
==== Scout car ====

A &quot;scout car&quot; is a military armoured reconnaissance vehicle, capable of off-road mobility and often carrying mounted weapons such as machine guns for offensive capabilities and crew protection. They often only carry an operational crew aboard, which differentiates them from wheeled armoured personnel carriers (APCs) and infantry mobility vehicles (IMVs), but early scout cars, such as the open-topped US M3 scout car could carry a crew of seven. The term is often used synonymously with the more general term armoured car, which also includes armoured civilian vehicles. They are also differentiated by being designed and built for purpose, as opposed to improvised &quot;technicals&quot; which might serve in the same role.

==== Reconnaissance vehicle ====
A &quot;reconnaissance vehicle&quot;, also known as a &quot;scout vehicle&quot;, is a military vehicle used for forward reconnaissance. Both tracked and wheeled reconnaissance vehicles are in service. In some countries, light tanks such as the M551 Sheridan and AMX-13 are also used by scout platoons. Reconnaissance vehicles are usually designed with a low profile or small size and are lightly armoured, relying on speed and cover to escape detection. Their armament ranges from a medium machine gun to an autocannon. Modern examples are often fitted with ATGMs and a wide range of sensors.
Armoured reconnaissance is the combination of terrestrial reconnaissance with armoured warfare by using tanks and wheeled or tracked armoured reconnaissance vehicles. While the mission of reconnaissance is to gather intelligence about the enemy with the use of reconnaissance vehicles, armoured reconnaissance adds the ability to fight for information, and to have an effect on and to shape the enemy through the performance of traditional armoured tasks. Some armoured personnel carriers and infantry mobility vehicle, such as the M113, TPz Fuchs, and Cadillac Gage Commando double in the reconnaissance role.
==== Internal security vehicle ====

An internal security vehicle (ISV), also known as an armoured security vehicle (ASV), is a combat vehicle used for suppressing civilian unrest. Security vehicles are typically armed with a turreted heavy machine gun and auxiliary medium machine gun. The vehicle is designed to minimize firepower dead space. Non-lethal water cannons and tear gas cannons can provide suppressive fire in lieu of unnecessary deadly fire.

The vehicle must be protected against weapons typical of riots. Protection from improvised incendiary devices is achieved though coverage of the air intake and exhaust ports as well as a strong locking mechanism on the fuel opening. Turret and door locks prevent access to the interior of the vehicle by rioters. Vision blocks, ballistic glass and window shutters and outside surveillance cameras allow protected observation from within the vehicle. Wheeled 4x4 and 6x6 configurations are typical of security vehicles. Tracked security vehicles are often cumbersome and leave negative political connotations for being perceived as an imperial invading force.
==== Military light utility vehicle ====

Military light utility vehicles are the lightest weight class of military vehicles. It refers to light 4x4 military vehicles with light or no armour and all-terrain mobility. This type of vehicle originated in the first half of the 20th century when horses and other draft animals were replaced with mechanization. Light utility vehicles such as the Willys Jeep were frequently mounted with .50-calibre machineguns and other small weapons for hit-and-run tactics in World War II, especially by the British Special Air Service who used Jeeps to raid Axis airfields during the North Africa campaign. After the war, vehicles like the Toyota Mega Cruiser and Humvee filled this role. In the 21st century, improvised explosive devices continue to pose threat to mobile infantry resulting in light utility vehicles being made heavier and with more armour.

==== Improvised fighting vehicle ====

An improvised fighting vehicle is a combat vehicle resulting from modifications to a civilian or military non-combat vehicle in order to give it a fighting capability. Such modifications usually consist of the grafting of armour plating and weapon systems. Various militaries have procured such vehicles, ever since the introduction of the first automobiles into military service.

During the early days, the absence of a doctrine for the military use of automobiles or of an industry dedicated to producing them, lead to much improvisation in the creation of early armoured cars, and other such vehicles. Later, despite the advent of arms industries in many countries, several armies still resorted to using ad hoc contraptions, often in response to unexpected military situations, or as a result of the development of new tactics for which no available vehicle was suitable. The construction of improvised fighting vehicles may also reflect a lack of means for the force that uses them. This is especially true in underdeveloped countries and even in developing countries, where various armies and guerrilla forces have used them, as they are more affordable than military-grade combat vehicles.

Modern examples include military gun truck used by units of regular armies or other official government armed forces, based on a conventional military cargo truck, that is able to carry a large weight of weapons and armour. They have mainly been used by regular armies to escort military convoys in regions subject to ambush by guerrilla forces. &quot;Narco tanks&quot;, used by Mexican drug cartels in the Mexican drug war, are built from such trucks, which combines operational mobility, tactical offensive, and defensive capabilities.

=== Troop carriers ===
Troop-carrying AFVs are divided into three main types – armoured personnel carriers (APCs), infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs) and infantry mobility vehicles (IMV). The main difference between the three is their intended role – the APC is designed purely to transport troops and is armed for self-defence only – whereas the IFV is designed to provide close-quarters and anti-armour fire support to the infantry it carries. IMV is a wheeled armoured personnel carrier serving as a military patrol, reconnaissance or security vehicle.

==== Armoured personnel carrier ====

Armoured personnel carriers (APCs) are intended to carry infantry quickly and relatively safely to the point where they are deployed. In the Battle of Amiens, 8 August 1918, the British Mk V* tank (a lengthened Mark V) carried a small number of machine gunners as an experiment, but the men were debilitated by the conditions inside the vehicle. Later that year the first purpose-built APC, the British Mk IX tank (Mark Nine), appeared. In 1944, the Canadian general Guy Simonds ordered the conversion of redundant armoured vehicles to carry troops (generically named &quot;Kangaroos&quot;). This proved highly successful, even without training, and the concept was widely used in the 21st Army Group. Post-war, specialised designs were built, such as the Soviet BTR-60 and US M113.

==== Infantry fighting vehicle ====

An &quot;infantry fighting vehicle&quot; (&quot;IFV&quot;), also known as a &quot;mechanized infantry combat vehicle&quot; (&quot;MICV&quot;), is a type of armoured fighting vehicle used to carry infantry into battle and provide direct fire support. The first example of an IFV was the West German Schützenpanzer Lang HS.30 which served in the Bundeswehr from 1958 until the early 1980s.

IFVs are similar to armoured personnel carriers (APCs) and infantry carrier vehicles (ICVs), designed to transport a section or squad of infantry (generally between five and ten men) and their equipment. They are differentiated from APCswhich are purely &quot;troop-transport&quot; vehicles armed only for self-defencebecause they are designed to give direct fire support to the dismounted infantry and so usually have significantly enhanced armament. IFVs also often have improved armour and some have firing ports (allowing the infantry to fire personal weapons while mounted).

They are typically armed with an autocannon of 20 to 57 mm calibre, 7.62mm machine guns, anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) and/or surface-to-air missiles (SAMs). IFVs are usually tracked, but some wheeled vehicles fall into this category. IFVs are generally less heavily armed and armoured than main battle tanks. They sometimes carry anti-tank missiles to protect and support infantry against armoured threats, such as the NATO TOW missile and Soviet Bastion, which offer a significant threat to tanks. Specially equipped IFVs have taken on some of the roles of light tanks; they are used by reconnaissance organizations, and light IFVs are used by airborne units which must be able to fight without the heavy firepower of tanks.

==== Infantry mobility vehicle ====
An &quot;infantry mobility vehicle&quot; (&quot;IMV&quot;) or &quot;protected patrol vehicle&quot; (&quot;PPV&quot;) is a wheeled armoured personnel carrier (APC) serving as a military patrol, reconnaissance or security vehicle. Examples include the ATF Dingo, AMZ Dzik, AMZ Tur, Mungo ESK, and Bushmaster IMV. This term also applies to the vehicles currently being fielded as part of the MRAP program.

IMVs were developed in response to the threats of modern counterinsurgency warfare, with an emphasis on Ambush Protection and Mine-Resistance. Similar vehicles existed long before the term IMV was coined, such as the French VAB and South African Buffel. The term is coming more into use to differentiate light 4x4 wheeled APCs from the traditional 8x8 wheeled APCs. It is a neologism for what might have been classified in the past as an armoured scout car, such as the BRDM, but the IMV is distinguished by having a requirement to carry dismountable infantry. The up-armoured M1114 Humvee variant can be seen as an adaptation of the unarmoured Humvee to serve in the IMV role.


=== Amphibious vehicles ===

Many modern military vehicles, ranging from light wheeled command and reconnaissance, through armoured personnel carriers and tanks, are manufactured with amphibious capabilities. Contemporary wheeled armoured amphibians include the French Véhicule de l&#x27;Avant Blindé and Véhicule Blindé Léger. The latter is a small, lightly armoured 4×4 all-terrain vehicle that is fully amphibious and can swim at 5.4 km/h. The VAB (&quot;Véhicule de l&#x27;Avant Blindé&quot; – &#x27;armoured vanguard vehicle&#x27;) is a fully amphibious armoured personnel carrier powered in the water by two water jets, that entered service in 1976 and produced in numerous configurations, ranging from basic personnel carrier, anti-tank missile platform.

During the Cold War the Soviet bloc states developed a number of amphibious APCs, fighting vehicles and tanks, both wheeled and tracked. Most of the vehicles the Soviets designed were amphibious, or could ford deep water. Wheeled examples are the BRDM-1 and BRDM-2 4x4 armoured scout cars, as well as the BTR-60, BTR-70, BTR-80, BTR-94 and BTR-90 8x8 armoured personnel carriers.
During the 1930s and 1940s, Japan produced a number of amphibious tank designs, including prototypes such as the Sumida amphibious armored car (AMP), SR I-Go, SR II Ro-Go, SR III Ha-Go, Type 1 Mi-Sha (a/k/a Type 1 Ka-Mi) and Type 5 To-Ku. Production amphibious tanks during World War II included the Type 2 Ka-Mi, and Type 3 Ka-Chi; production amphibious transports included the F B swamp vehicle and Type 4 Ka-Tsu APC. All production units were for use by the Japanese Special Naval Landing Forces in campaigns in the Pacific with amphibious operations.

The United States started developing a long line of Landing Vehicle Tracked (LVT) designs from . The US Marine Corps currently uses the AAV7-A1 Assault Amphibious Vehicle, which was to be succeeded by the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle, which was capable of planing on water and can achieve water speeds of 37–46 km/h. The EFV project has been cancelled.

A significant number of tracked armoured vehicles that are primarily intended for land-use, have some amphibious capability, tactically useful inland, reducing dependence on bridges. They use their tracks, sometimes with added propeller or water jets for propulsion. As long as the banks have a shallow enough slopes to enter or leave the water they can cross rivers and water obstacles.

Some heavy tanks can operate amphibiously with a fabric skirt to add buoyancy. The Sherman DD tank used in the Normandy landings had this setup. When in water the waterproof float screen was raised and propellers deployed. Some modern vehicles use a similar skirt.

=== Airborne vehicles ===
Lightweight armoured fighting vehicles designed or modified to be carried by aircraft and delivered by air drop, helicopter lift, glider, or air landing with infantry to provide heavier tactical firepower and mobility. The air-equivalent to amphibious vehicles, the main advantage of airborne forces is their ability to be deployed into combat zones without land passage, as long as the airspace is accessible. Airborne vehicles are limited only by the tonnage capacity of their transport aircraft. Airborne vehicles typically lack the armour and supplies necessary for prolonged combat, so they are utilized for establishing an airhead to bring in larger forces before carrying out other combat objectives. One modern example is the German Wiesel AWC. The USA also created the M22 Locust as a way to aid paratroopers/ being paradropped in as it was very lightly armoured and very small.

=== Armoured engineering vehicle ===
Modern engineering AFV&#x27;s utilize chassis based on main battle tank platforms: these vehicles are as well armoured and protected as tanks, designed to keep up with tanks, breach obstacles to help tanks get to wherever it needs to be, perform utility functions necessary to expedite mission objectives of tanks, and to conduct other earth-moving and engineering work on the battlefield. These vehicles go by different names depending upon the country of use or manufacture. In the United States the term &quot;combat engineer vehicle (CEV)&quot; is used, in the United Kingdom the term &quot;Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers (AVRE)&quot; is used, while in Canada and other commonwealth nations the term &quot;armoured engineer vehicle (AEV)&quot; is used. There is no set template for what such a vehicle will look like, yet likely features include a large dozer blade or mine ploughs, a large calibre demolition cannon, augers, winches, excavator arms and cranes, or lifting booms.

Although the term &quot;armoured engineer vehicle&quot; is used specifically to describe these multi-purpose tank-based engineering vehicles, that term is also used more generically in British and Commonwealth militaries to describe all heavy tank-based engineering vehicles used in the support of mechanized forces. Thus, &quot;armoured engineer vehicle&quot; used generically would refer to AEV, AVLB, Assault Breachers, and so on. Good examples of this type of vehicle include the UK Trojan AVRE, the Russian IMR, and the US M728 Combat Engineer Vehicle.

==== Breaching vehicle ====

A breaching vehicle is especially designed to clear pathways for troops and other vehicles through minefields and along roadside bombs and other improvised explosive devices. These vehicles are equipped with mechanical or other means for the breaching of man-made obstacles. Common types of breaching vehicles include mechanical flails, mine plough vehicles, and mine roller vehicles.
==== Armoured bulldozer ====
The armoured bulldozer is a basic tool of combat engineering. These combat engineering vehicles combine the earth moving capabilities of the bulldozer with armour which protects the vehicle and its operator in or near combat. Most are civilian bulldozers modified by addition of vehicle armour/military equipment, but some are tanks stripped of armament and fitted with a dozer blade. Some tanks have bulldozer blades while retaining their armament, but this does not make them armoured bulldozers as such, because combat remains the primary role – earth moving is a secondary task.
==== Armoured recovery vehicle ====

An &quot;armoured recovery vehicle&quot; (&quot;ARV&quot;) is a type of vehicle recovery armoured fighting vehicle used to repair battle- or mine-damaged as well as broken-down armoured vehicles during combat, or to tow them out of the danger zone for more extensive repairs. To this end the term &quot;armoured repair and recovery vehicle&quot; (&quot;ARRV&quot;) is also used.

ARVs are normally built on the chassis of a main battle tank (MBT), but some are also constructed on the basis of other armoured fighting vehicles, mostly armoured personnel carriers (APCs). ARVs are usually built on the basis of a vehicle in the same class as they are supposed to recover; a tank-based ARV is used to recover tanks, while an APC-based one recovers APCs, but does not have the power to tow a much heavier tank.
==== Armoured vehicle-launched bridge ====

An &quot;armoured vehicle-launched bridge&quot; (&quot;AVLB&quot;) is a combat support vehicle, sometimes regarded as a subtype of combat engineering vehicle, designed to assist militaries in rapidly deploying tanks and other armoured fighting vehicles across rivers. The AVLB is usually a tracked vehicle converted from a tank chassis to carry a folding metal bridge instead of weapons. The AVLB&#x27;s job is to allow armoured or infantry units to cross water, when a river too deep for vehicles to wade through is reached, and no bridge is conveniently located (or sufficiently sturdy, a substantial concern when moving 60-ton tanks).

The bridge layer unfolds and launches its cargo, providing a ready-made bridge across the obstacle in only minutes. Once the span has been put in place, the AVLB vehicle detaches from the bridge, and moves aside to allow traffic to pass. Once all of the vehicles have crossed, it crosses the bridge itself and reattaches to the bridge on the other side. It then retracts the span ready to move off again. A similar procedure can be employed to allow crossings of small chasms or similar obstructions. AVLBs can carry bridges of or greater in length. By using a tank chassis, the bridge layer is able to cover the same terrain as main battle tanks, and the provision of armour allows them to operate even in the face of enemy fire. However, this is not a universal attribute: some exceptionally sturdy 6x6 or 8x8 truck chassis have lent themselves to bridge-layer applications.
==== Combat engineer section carriers ====
&quot;Combat engineer section carriers&quot; are used to transport sappers (combat engineers) and can be fitted with bulldozers&#x27; blades and other mine-breaching devices. They are often used as APCs because of their carrying ability and heavy protection. They are usually armed with machine guns and grenade launchers and usually tracked to provide enough tractive force to push blades and rakes. Some examples are the U.S. M113 APC, IDF Puma, Nagmachon, Husky, and U.S. M1132 ESV (a Stryker variant).


=== Air defence vehicles ===
An anti-aircraft vehicle, also known as a self-propelled anti-aircraft gun (SPAAG) or self-propelled air defense system (SPAD), is a mobile vehicle with a dedicated anti-aircraft capability.
Specific weapon systems used include machine guns, anti-aircraft autocannons, larger anti-air guns, or surface-to-air-missiles, and some mount both guns and longer-ranged missiles (e.g. the Pantsir-S1). Platforms used include both trucks and heavier combat vehicles such as armored personnel carriers and tanks, which add protection from aircraft, artillery, and small arms fire for front line deployment.
Anti-aircraft guns are usually mounted in a quickly-traversing turret with a high rate of elevation, for tracking fast-moving aircraft. They are often in dual or quadruple mounts, allowing a high rate of fire. In addition, most anti-aircraft guns can be used in a direct-fire role against surface targets to great effect. In the early 21st century, missiles (generally mounted on similar turrets) largely supplanted anti-aircraft guns, though guns have recently shown revived utility against slow, low-flying drones.

=== Self-propelled artillery ===

Self-propelled artillery vehicles give mobility to artillery. Within the term are covered self-propelled guns (or howitzers) and rocket artillery. They are highly mobile, usually based on tracked chassis carrying either a large howitzer or other field gun or alternatively a mortar or some form of rocket or missile launcher. They are usually used for long-range indirect bombardment support on the battlefield.

In the past, self-propelled artillery has included direct-fire &quot;Gun Motor Carriage&quot; vehicles, such as assault guns and tank destroyers (also known as self-propelled anti-tank guns). These have been heavily armoured vehicles, the former providing danger-close fire-support for infantry and the latter acting as specialized anti-tank vehicles.

Modern self-propelled artillery vehicles may superficially resemble tanks, but they are generally lightly armoured, too lightly to survive in direct-fire combat. However, they protect their crews against shrapnel and small arms and are therefore usually included as armoured fighting vehicles. Many are equipped with machine guns for defence against enemy infantry.

The key advantage of self-propelled over towed artillery is that it can be brought into action much faster. Before towed artillery can be used, it has to stop, unlimber and the guns set up. To move position, the guns must be limbered up again and brought – usually towed – to the new location. By comparison, self-propelled artillery in combination with modern communications, can stop at a chosen location and begin firing almost immediately, then quickly move on to a new position. This ability is very useful in a mobile conflict and particularly on the advance.

Conversely, towed artillery was and remains cheaper to build and maintain. It is also lighter and can be taken to places that self-propelled guns cannot reach, so despite the advantages of the self-propelled artillery, towed guns remain in the arsenals of many modern armies.

==== Assault gun ====

An assault gun is a gun or howitzer mounted on a motor vehicle or armoured chassis, designed for use in the direct fire role in support of infantry when attacking other infantry or fortified positions.

Historically, the custom-built fully armoured assault guns usually mounted the gun or howitzer in a fully enclosed casemate on a tank chassis. The use of a casemate instead of a gun turret limited these weapons&#x27; field of fire, but allowed a larger gun to be fitted relative to the chassis, more armour to be fitted for the same weight, and provided a cheaper construction. In most cases, these turretless vehicles also presented a lower profile as a target for the enemy.

==== Self-propelled siege gun ====
Self-Propelled siege guns often carry cannons or mortars in excess of 400mm. The carrying platform could be multiple vehicles, built for use on train rails, or a purpose-built chassis.
==== Mortar carrier ====

A mortar carrier, or self-propelled mortar, is a self-propelled artillery vehicle carrying one or more mortar as its primary weapon. Mortar carriers cannot be fired while on the move and some must be dismounted to fire. In U.S. Army doctrine, mortar carriers provide close and immediate indirect fire support for maneuver units while allowing for rapid displacement and quick reaction to the tactical situation. The ability to relocate not only allows fire support to be provided where it is needed faster, but also allows these units to avoid counter-battery fire. Mortar carriers have traditionally avoided direct contact with the enemy. Many units report never using secondary weapons in combat.

Prior to the Iraq War, American 120 mm mortar platoons reorganized from six M1064 mortar carriers and two M577 fire direction centres (FDC) to four M1064 and one FDC. The urban environment of Iraq made it difficult to utilize mortars. New technologies such as mortar ballistic computers and communication equipment and are being integrated. Modern era combat is becoming more reliant on direct fire support from mortar carrier machine guns.

==== Multiple rocket launcher ====

A multiple rocket launcher is a type of unguided rocket artillery system. Like other rocket artillery, multiple rocket launchers are less accurate and have a much lower (sustained) rate of fire than batteries of traditional artillery guns. However, they have the capability of simultaneously dropping many hundreds of kilograms of explosive, with devastating effect.

The Korean Hwacha is an example of an early weapon system with a resemblance to the modern-day multiple rocket launcher. The first self-propelled multiple rocket launchers – and arguably the most famous – were the Soviet BM-13 Katyushas, first used during World War II and exported to Soviet allies afterwards. They were simple systems in which a rack of launch rails was mounted on the back of a truck. This set the template for modern multiple rocket launchers. The first modern multiple rocket launcher was the German &quot;15 cm Nebelwerfer 41&quot; of the 1930s, a small towed artillery piece. Only later in World War II did the British deploy similar weapons in the form of the Land Mattress.The Americans mounted tubular launchers atop M4 Sherman tanks to create the T34 Calliope rocket launching tank, only used in small numbers, as their closest equivalent to the Katyusha.

==== Missile vehicle ====
Missile vehicles are trucks or tractor units designed to carry rockets or missiles. The missile vehicle may be a self-propelled unit, or the missile holder/launcher may be on a trailer towed by a prime mover. They are used in the military forces of a number of countries in the world. Long missiles are commonly transported parallel to the ground on these vehicles, but elevated into an inclined or vertical position for launching.
* A Transporter erector launcher (TEL) is a missile vehicle with an integrated prime mover (tractor unit) that can carry, elevate to firing position and launch one or more missiles. Such vehicles exist for both surface-to-air missiles and surface-to-surface missiles.
==== Tank destroyer ====
Tank destroyers and tank hunters are armed with an anti-tank gun or anti-tank missile launcher, and are designed specifically to engage enemy armoured vehicles. Many have been based on a tracked tank chassis, while others are wheeled. Since World War II, main battle tanks have largely replaced gun-armed tank destroyers; although lightly armoured anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) carriers are commonly used for supplementary long-range anti-tank engagements.

In post-Cold War conflict, the resurgence of expeditionary warfare has seen the emergence of gun-armed wheeled vehicles, sometimes called &quot;protected gun systems&quot;, which may bear a superficial resemblance to tank destroyers, but are employed as direct fire support units typically providing support in low intensity operations such as Iraq and Afghanistan. These have the advantage of easier deployment, as only the largest air transports can carry a main battle tank, and their smaller size makes them more effective in urban combat.

Many forces&#x27; IFVs carry anti-tank missiles in every infantry platoon, and attack helicopters have also added anti-tank capability to the modern battlefield. But there are still dedicated anti-tank vehicles with very heavy long-range missiles, or intended for airborne use. There have also been dedicated anti-tank vehicles built on ordinary armoured personnel carrier or armoured car chassis. Examples include the U.S. M901 ITV (Improved TOW Vehicle) and the Norwegian NM142, both on an M113 chassis, several Soviet ATGM launchers based on the BRDM scout car, the British FV438 Swingfire and FV102 Striker and the German &quot;Raketenjagdpanzer&quot; series built on the chassis of the HS 30 and Mardar IFVs.

=== Armoured train ===

An &quot;armoured train&quot; is a railway train protected with armour. They are usually equipped with rail cars armed with artillery, autocannons, machine guns, tank turrets and anti-aircraft guns. They were mostly used during the late 19th to mid-20th century, when they offered an innovative way to quickly move large amounts of firepower. Their use was discontinued in most countries when road vehicles became much more powerful and offered more flexibility, and because armoured trains were too vulnerable to track sabotage and attacks from the air. However, the Russian Federation used improvised armoured trains in the Second Chechen War in the late 1990s and 2000s. Armoured trains carrying ballistic missiles have also been used.

The rail cars on an armoured train were designed for many tasks, such as carrying artillery and machine guns, infantry units, anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns. During World War II, the Germans would sometimes put a &quot;Fremdgerät&quot; (captured AFVs such as the French Somua S-35 or Czech PzKpfw 38(t)), or obsolescent Panzer II light tanks on a flatbed rail car, which could quickly be offloaded by means of a ramp and used away from the railway line to chase down enemy partisans.

Different types of armour were used to protect armoured trains from attack. In addition to various metal plates, concrete and sandbags were used in some cases on armoured trains.

Armoured trains were sometimes escorted by a kind of rail-tank called a draisine. One such example was the Italian &#x27;Littorina&#x27; armoured trolley, which had a cab in the front and rear, each with a control set so it could be driven down the tracks in either direction. Littorina mounted two dual 7.92mm MG13 machine gun turrets from Panzer I light tanks.

A missile vehicle, also known as a missile carrier, missile truck, or (if capable of launching) missile launcher vehicle, is a military vehicle that is purpose-built and designed to carry missiles, either for safe transportation or for launching missiles in combat. Missile vehicles include transporter erector launchers (TEL) and multiple rocket launchers (MRL).

<doc id="2151" wikidata="Q76989" url="?curid=2151" title="Anton Drexler">
<text>Anton Drexler (13 June 1884 – 24 February 1942) was a German far-right political agitator for the &quot;Völkisch&quot; movement in the 1920s. He founded the German Workers&#x27; Party (DAP), the pan-German and anti-Semitic antecedent of the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Drexler mentored his successor in the NSDAP, Adolf Hitler, during his early years in politics.

==Early life==
Born in Munich, Drexler was a machine-fitter before becoming a railway toolmaker and locksmith in Berlin. He is believed to have been disappointed with his income, and to have played the zither in restaurants to supplement his earnings. Drexler did not serve in the armed forces during World War I because he was deemed physically unfit for service.

==Politics==

During World War I, Drexler joined the German Fatherland Party, a short-lived far-right party active during the last phase of the war, which played a significant role in the emergence of the stab-in-the-back myth and the defamation of certain politicians as the &quot;November Criminals&quot;.

In March 1918, Drexler founded a branch of the Free Workers&#x27; Committee for a Good Peace (&quot;Der Freie Arbeiterausschuss für einen guten Frieden&quot;) league. Karl Harrer, a journalist and member of the Thule Society, convinced Drexler and several others to form the Political Workers&#x27; Circle (&quot;Politischer Arbeiter-Zirkel&quot;) in 1918. The members met periodically for discussions about nationalism and antisemitism.

===German Workers&#x27; Party===
Together with Harrer, Drexler founded the German Workers&#x27; Party (DAP) in Munich on 5 January 1919. At a DAP meeting in Munich on 12 September 1919, the main speaker was Gottfried Feder, who held a lecture on the subject of &#x27;the breaking of interest slavery&#x27;. When Feder&#x27;s lecture concluded, Adolf Hitler – who attended the meeting as part of his assignment from the German Army to watch political agitators – got involved in a heated political argument with a visitor, Professor Adalbert Baumann, who questioned the soundness of Feder&#x27;s arguments and in turn spoke in favour of Bavarian separatism. In vehemently attacking the man&#x27;s arguments, Hitler made an impression on the other party members with his oratorical abilities, and according to him, the professor left the hall defeated. Drexler approached Hitler and gave him a copy of his pamphlet &quot;My Political Awakening&quot;. Hitler later claimed the literature reflected the ideals he already held since his own &quot;political awakening&quot;. Impressed with Hitler, Drexler encouraged him to join the DAP. On the orders of his army superiors, Hitler applied to join the party.

Once accepted, Hitler began to make the party more public by drawing people in with his speaking abilities, leading up to his organizing the party&#x27;s biggest meeting yet, which attracted 2,000 people to the Hofbräuhaus in Munich on 24 February 1920. It was in this speech that Hitler, for the first time, enunciated the twenty-five points of the German Worker&#x27;s Party&#x27;s manifesto that he had authored with Drexler and Feder. Through these points, he gave the organisation a foreign policy, including the abrogation of the Treaty of Versailles, a Greater Germany, Eastern expansion, and exclusion of Jews from citizenship. On the same day the party was renamed the National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party (&quot;Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei&quot;, NSDAP).

Following an intraparty dispute, Hitler angrily tendered his resignation on 11 July 1921. However, Drexler and the party&#x27;s governing committee members realised that the resignation of their leading public figure and speaker would mean the end of the party. So Dietrich Eckart was asked by the Party leadership to speak with Hitler and relay the conditions in which he would agree to return. Hitler announced he would rejoin the party on the condition that he would replace Drexler as party chairman, with dictatorial powers and the title of &quot;Führer&quot;, and that the party headquarters would remain in Munich. The committee agreed and he rejoined the party as member 3,680. Drexler was thereafter moved to the purely symbolic position of honorary president.

Drexler was also a member of a &quot;völkisch&quot; political club for affluent members of Munich society known as the Thule Society. His membership in the Nazi Party ended when it was temporarily outlawed in 1923 following the Beer Hall Putsch, although Drexler had not taken part in the coup attempt. In 1924, he was elected to the Bavarian state parliament for the Völkisch-Social Bloc party (VSB), in which he served as vice president until 1928. He played no role in the Nazi Party&#x27;s re-founding in February 1925 and rejoined only after Hitler ascended to national power in 1933. In May 1925, he founded a group with other VSB deputies, the &quot;Nationalsozialer Volksbund&quot; (National Social People&#x27;s League), but it was dissolved in 1927–1928. Drexler received the Nazi Party&#x27;s Blood Order in 1934, and was still occasionally used as a propaganda tool until about 1937, but was never allowed any power within the party.

==Death==
Drexler died in Munich in February 1942 after a lengthy illness due to alcoholism.

<text>All Quiet on the Western Front () is a semi-autobiographical novel by Erich Maria Remarque, a German veteran of World War I. The book describes the German soldiers&#x27; extreme physical and mental trauma during the war as well as the detachment from civilian life felt by many upon returning home from the war. It is billed by some as &quot;the greatest war novel of all time&quot;.

The novel was first published in November and December 1928 in the German newspaper and in book form in late January 1929. The book and its sequel, &quot;The Road Back&quot; (1931), were among the books banned and burned in Nazi Germany. &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; sold 2.5 million copies in 22 languages in its first 18 months in print.

Three film adaptations of the book have been made, each of which was lauded. The 1930 American adaptation, directed by Lewis Milestone, won two Academy Awards. The 1979 British-American adaptation, a television film by Delbert Mann, won a Golden Globe Award and an Emmy Award. The 2022 German adaptation, directed by Edward Berger, won four Academy Awards.

The original book and its first English translation entered the public domain in the United States in 2024 and 2025, respectively; the 1930 film adaptation is set to do so in 2026.

==Title and translation==
The 1929 English translation by Arthur Wesley Wheen gives the title as&quot; All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;. The literal translation of &quot;&quot; is &quot;Nothing New in the West,&quot; with &quot;West&quot; being the Western Front; the phrase refers to the content of an official communiqué at the end of the novel.

Brian Murdoch&#x27;s 1993 translation rendered the phrase as &quot;there was nothing new to report on the Western Front&quot; within the narrative. However, in the foreword, he explains his retention of the original book title:
Although it does not match the German exactly, Wheen&#x27;s title has justly become part of the English language and is retained here with gratitude.
The phrase &quot;&quot; has become a colloquial expression meaning stagnation, or lack of visible change, in any context.

Murdoch also explains how, owing to the time it was published, Wheen&#x27;s translation was obliged to Anglicise some lesser-known German references and lessen the impact of certain passages while omitting others entirely. Murdoch&#x27;s translation is more accurate to the original text and completely unexpurgated.

==Plot summary==
The book centers on Paul Bäumer, a German soldier on the Western Front during World War I. Before the war, Paul lived with his parents and sister in a charming German village. He attended school, where the patriotic speeches of his teacher Kantorek led the whole class to volunteer for the Imperial German Army shortly after the start of the Great War. At the training camp, where they meet Himmelstoß, his class is scattered over the platoons amongst Frisian fishermen, peasants and labourers, with whom they soon become friends. Bäumer arrives at the Western Front with his friends and schoolmates (Albert, Kemmerich, Leer, Müller, and a number of other characters). There they meet Stanislaus Katczinsky, an older recalled reservist, nicknamed Kat, who becomes Paul&#x27;s mentor.
While fighting at the front, Bäumer and his comrades engage in frequent battles and endure the treacherous and filthy conditions of trench warfare. The battles fought here have no names and only meager pieces of land are gained, which are often lost again later. Remarque often refers to the living soldiers as old and dead, emotionally drained and shaken.

Paul visits home, and the contrast with civilian life highlights the cost of the war on his psyche. The town has not changed since he went off to war, but he has: he finds that he does &quot;not belong here any more, it is a foreign world&quot;. Paul recovers the books and writings he had left in his childhood room, but finds his passion for literature to have been completely erased by the trauma of war. He feels disconnected from most of the townspeople, who ask him &quot;stupid and distressing&quot; questions about his experiences or lecture him about strategy and advancing to Paris while insisting that Paul and his friends know only their &quot;own little sector&quot; but nothing of the big picture. Indeed, the only person he remains connected to is his dying mother, with whom he shares a tender yet restrained relationship. In the end, he concludes that he &quot;ought never to have come [home] on leave&quot;.

Paul is glad to return and reunite with his comrades. Soon after, he volunteers to go on a patrol and kills a Frenchman in hand-to-hand combat for the first time. He watches the man die slowly in agony for hours. He is remorseful and devastated, asking for forgiveness from the man&#x27;s corpse. He later confesses to Kat and Albert, who try to comfort him and reassure him that it is only part of the war. Paul and his company receive a temporary reprieve from the horrid rations and living conditions of the trenches when they are instead sent to a supply depot in an occupied French town. They enjoy food and luxuries taken from the depot or looted from the town but continue to lose men to Allied shelling, culminating in Paul and Albert being wounded while evacuating civilians and needing to be diverted to a Catholic hospital far behind the lines. Albert eventually has his leg amputated, whilst Paul is deemed fit for service and returned to the front.

By the closing months of the war, German morale is almost nonexistent as the men realize they are only fighting to delay an armistice. The Americans have recently joined the war as both they and the English begin outperforming the far more poorly equipped Germans. In despair Paul watches as his friends fall one by one. Kat&#x27;s death is the last straw that finally causes Paul to lose his will to live. In the final chapter he comments that peace is coming soon but he does not see the future as bright and shining with hope. Paul feels that he has no aims left in life and that their generation will be different and misunderstood.

In October 1918 Paul is finally killed on a remarkably peaceful day. The situation report from the frontline states a simple phrase: &quot;All quiet on the Western Front.&quot; Paul&#x27;s corpse displays a calm expression on its face, &quot;as though almost glad the end had come.&quot;

==Themes==
At the beginning of the book, Remarque writes, &quot;This book is to be neither an accusation nor a confession, and least of all an adventure, for death is not an adventure to those who stand face to face with it. It will try simply to tell of a generation of men who, even though they may have escaped (its) shells, were destroyed by the war.&quot; The book does not focus on heroic stories of bravery, but rather gives a view of the conditions in which the soldiers find themselves. The monotony between battles, the constant threat of artillery fire and bombardments, the struggle to find food, the lack of training of young recruits (meaning lower chances of survival), and the overarching role of random chance in the lives and deaths of the soldiers are described in detail.

Another major theme is the concept of blind nationalism. Remarque often emphasizes that the boys were not forced to join the war effort against their will, but rather by a sense of patriotism and pride. Kantorek called Paul&#x27;s platoon the &quot;Iron Youth&quot;, teaching his students a romanticized version of warfare with glory and duty to the Fatherland. It is only when the boys go to war and have to live and fight in dirty, cramped trenches with little protection from enemy bullets and shells while contending with hunger and sickness that they realize just how dispiriting it is to actually serve in the army.

==Characters==
*Paul Bäumer: The narrator and protagonist of the story, Paul is a thoughtful and sensitive young man who serves as the reader&#x27;s guide through the horrors of war. He is nineteen years old and joined the army straight out of school along with his classmates. Paul undergoes a profound transformation as he experiences the dehumanizing effects of war and grapples with the trauma of killing. His internal monologues reveal his growing disillusionment, his longing for peace, and his struggle to retain his humanity. 
*Albert Kropp: Kropp is in Paul&#x27;s class at school and is described as the clearest thinker of the group as well as the smallest. Kropp is wounded towards the end of the novel and undergoes a leg amputation. Both he and Bäumer end up spending time in a Catholic hospital together, Bäumer suffering from shrapnel wounds to the leg and arm.
*Haie Westhus: Haie is tall and strong with a good sense of humor, and a peat-digger by profession. His size and behavior make him seem older than Paul, yet he is the same age as Paul and his school-friends, who are roughly 19 at the start of the book. During combat, he is fatally injured in his back (Chapter 6).
*Friedrich Müller: Müller is one of Bäumer&#x27;s classmates, and is 19 when he also volunteers to join the German army. He is killed later after being shot point-blank in the stomach with a flare gun.
*Stanislaus &quot;Kat&quot; Katczinsky: Katczinsky, a recalled reserve militiaman, was a cobbler in civilian life. He is older than Paul Bäumer and his comrades, about 40 years old, and serves as their leadership figure.
*Tjaden: One of Bäumer&#x27;s non-schoolmate friends. Before the war, Tjaden was a locksmith and a big eater with a grudge against the former postman-turned-corporal Himmelstoß.
*Himmelstoß: Sergeant der Reserve Himmelstoß was a village postman before being mobilised for the war and securing a position as a Sergeant in the Landwehr (Reserves of persons 28–39). Himmelstoß is a power-hungry martinet with a special contempt for Paul and his friends, because they knew him as their local postman.

===Secondary characters===

* Franz Kemmerich had enlisted with his best friend and classmate, Bäumer, at only 19 years. Kemmerich is shot in the leg early in the story; his injured leg has to be amputated, and he dies shortly after. In anticipation of Kemmerich&#x27;s imminent death, Müller was eager to get his boots. Paul later visits Kemmerich&#x27;s mother while on leave, and lies to her that Franz died instantly and painlessly.
* Behm was a youthful and overweight student and the only one in Paul&#x27;s class that was not quickly influenced by Kantorek&#x27;s patriotism to join the war, but is pressured into volunteering alongside his friends. He is the first of Paul&#x27;s friends to die. He is blinded in no man&#x27;s land and believed to be dead by his friends. The next day, when he is seen walking blindly around no man&#x27;s land, it is discovered that he was only unconscious, but he is killed before he can be rescued.
* Kantorek is the schoolmaster of Paul and his friends, including Kropp, Leer, Müller, and Behm. Behaving &quot;in a way that cost [him] nothing,&quot; Kantorek is a strong supporter of the war and encourages Bäumer and other students in his class to join the war effort.
* Mittelstädt is another of Paul&#x27;s school friends who is promoted to training reservists behind the front, where in a twist of fate he ends up with Kantorek in his unit after the schoolmaster is drafted himself.
* Leer is an intelligent soldier in Bäumer&#x27;s company, and one of his classmates, and an &quot;old hand&quot; at womanizing and seduction.
* Lieutenant Bertinck is the leader of Bäumer&#x27;s company. He is shot towards the end of the war while defending his men from a flamethrower team, losing his chin in the same explosion that wounds Leer.
* Detering is a farmer who longs to return to his wife and farm. He is fond of horses and is angered when he sees them used in combat.
* Hamacher is a patient at the Catholic hospital where Paul and Albert Kropp are temporarily stationed.

==Publication and reception==

From November 10 to December 9, 1928, &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; was published in serial form in &quot;Vossische Zeitung&quot; magazine. It was released in book form the following year to great success, selling one and a half million copies that same year. Although publishers had worried that interest in World War I had waned more than 10 years after the armistice, Remarque&#x27;s realistic depiction of trench warfare from the perspective of young soldiers struck a chord with the war&#x27;s survivors—veterans and civilians alike—and provoked strong reactions, both positive and negative, around the world.

With &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;, Remarque emerged as an eloquent spokesman for a generation that had been, in his own words, &quot;destroyed by war, even though it might have escaped its shells.&quot; Remarque&#x27;s harshest critics, in turn, were his countrymen, many of whom felt the book denigrated the German war effort, and that Remarque had exaggerated the horrors of war to further his pacifist agenda. The strongest voices against Remarque came from the emerging Nazi Party and its ideological allies. In 1933, when the Nazis rose to power, &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; became one of the first degenerate books to be publicly burnt; in 1930, screenings of the Academy Award-winning film based on the book were met with Nazi-organized protests and mob attacks on both movie theatres and audience members.

Objections to Remarque&#x27;s portrayal of the World War I German soldiers were not limited to those of the Nazis in 1933. Dr. was concerned about Remarque&#x27;s depiction of the medical personnel as being inattentive, uncaring, or absent from frontline action. Kroner was specifically worried that the book would perpetuate German stereotypes abroad that had subsided since the First World War. He offered the following clarification: &quot;People abroad will draw the following conclusions: if German doctors deal with their own fellow countrymen in this manner, what acts of inhumanity will they not perpetuate against helpless prisoners delivered up into their hands or against the populations of occupied territory?&quot;

A fellow patient of Remarque&#x27;s in the military hospital in Duisburg objected to the negative depictions of the nuns and patients and to the general portrayal of soldiers: &quot;There were soldiers to whom the protection of homeland, protection of house and homestead, protection of family were the highest objective, and to whom this will to protect their homeland gave the strength to endure any extremities.&quot;

These criticisms suggest that experiences of the war and the personal reactions of individual soldiers to their experiences may be more diverse than Remarque portrays them; however, it is beyond question that Remarque gives voice to a side of the war and its experience that was overlooked or suppressed at the time. This perspective is crucial to understanding the true effects of World War I. The evidence can be seen in the lingering depression that Remarque and many of his friends and acquaintances were suffering a decade later.

The book was also banned in other European countries on the grounds that it was considered anti-war propaganda; Austrian soldiers were forbidden from reading the book in 1929, and Czechoslovakia banned it from its military libraries. The Italian translation was also banned in 1933. When the Nazis were re-militarizing Germany, the book was banned as it was deemed counterproductive to German rearmament. In contrast, &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; was trumpeted by pacifists as an anti-war book.

Remarque makes a point in the opening statement that the novel does not advocate any political position, but is merely an attempt to describe the experiences of the soldier.

Much of the literary criticism came from Salomo Friedlaender, who wrote a book &quot;Hat Erich Maria Remarque wirklich gelebt?&quot; &quot;Did Erich Maria Remarque really live?&quot; (under the pen name Mynona), which was, in its turn, criticized in: &quot;Hat Mynona wirklich gelebt?&quot; &quot;Did Mynona really live?&quot; by Kurt Tucholsky. Friedlaender&#x27;s criticism was mainly personal in nature—he attacked Remarque as being egocentric and greedy. Remarque publicly stated that he wrote &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; for personal reasons, not for profit, as Friedlaender had charged.

&quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; was followed in 1931 by &quot;The Road Back&quot;, which follows the surviving characters after the Treaty of Versailles, and the two are considered part of a trilogy alongside the narratively unrelated &quot;Three Comrades&quot;, released in 1936 and set well into the post-war era.
