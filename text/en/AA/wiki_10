<text>Anxiety is an emotion characterised by an unpleasant state of inner and includes feelings of dread over anticipated events. Anxiety is different from fear in that fear is defined as the emotional response to a present threat, whereas anxiety is the anticipation of a future one. It is often accompanied by nervous behavior such as pacing back and forth, somatic complaints, and rumination.

Anxiety is a feeling of uneasiness and worry, usually generalized and unfocused as an overreaction to a situation that is only subjectively seen as menacing. It is often accompanied by muscular tension, restlessness, fatigue, inability to catch one&#x27;s breath, tightness in the abdominal region, nausea, and problems in concentration. Anxiety is closely related to fear, which is a response to a real or perceived immediate threat (fight-or-flight response); anxiety involves the expectation of a future threat including dread. People facing anxiety may withdraw from situations which have provoked anxiety in the past.

The emotion of anxiety can persist beyond the developmentally appropriate time-periods in response to specific events, and thus turning into one of the multiple anxiety disorders (e.g. generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder). The difference between &quot;anxiety disorder&quot; (as mental disorder) and &quot;anxiety&quot; (as normal emotion), is that people with an anxiety disorder experience anxiety excessively or persistently during approximately 6 months, or even during shorter time-periods in children. Anxiety disorders are among the most persistent mental problems and often last decades. Anxiety can also be experienced within other mental disorders, e.g., obsessive–compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder.

==Anxiety vs. fear==
Anxiety is distinguished from fear, which is an appropriate cognitive and emotional response to a perceived threat. Anxiety is related to the specific behaviors of fight-or-flight responses, defensive behavior or escape. There is a false presumption that often circulates that anxiety only occurs in situations perceived as uncontrollable or unavoidable, but this is not always so. David Barlow defines anxiety as &quot;a future-oriented mood state in which one is not ready or prepared to attempt to cope with upcoming negative events,&quot; and that it is a distinction between future and present dangers which divides anxiety and fear. Another description of anxiety is agony, dread, terror, or even apprehension. In positive psychology, anxiety is described as the mental state that results from a difficult challenge for which the subject has insufficient coping skills.

Fear and anxiety can be differentiated into four domains: (1) duration of emotional experience, (2) temporal focus, (3) specificity of the threat, and (4) motivated direction. Fear is short-lived, present-focused, geared towards a specific threat, and facilitating escape from threat. On the other hand, anxiety is long-acting, future-focused, broadly focused towards a diffuse threat, and promoting excessive caution while approaching a potential threat and interferes with constructive coping.

Joseph E. LeDoux and Lisa Feldman Barrett have both sought to separate automatic threat responses from additional associated cognitive activity within anxiety.

==Symptoms==
Anxiety can be experienced with long, drawn-out daily symptoms that reduce quality of life, known as chronic (or generalized) anxiety, or it can be experienced in short spurts with sporadic, stressful panic attacks, known as acute anxiety. Symptoms of anxiety can range in number, intensity, and frequency, depending on the person. However, most people do not suffer from chronic anxiety.

Anxiety can induce several psychological pains (e.g. depression) or mental disorders, and may lead to self-harm or suicide.

The behavioral effects of anxiety may include withdrawal from situations which have provoked anxiety or negative feelings in the past. Other effects may include changes in sleeping patterns, changes in habits, increase or decrease in food intake, and increased motor tension (such as foot tapping).

The emotional effects of anxiety may include feelings of apprehension or dread, trouble concentrating, feeling tense or jumpy, anticipating the worst, irritability, restlessness, watching for signs of danger, and a feeling of empty mindedness. as well as &quot;nightmares/bad dreams, obsessions about sensations, déjà vu, a trapped-in-your-mind feeling, and feeling like everything is scary.&quot; It may include a vague experience and feeling of helplessness.

The cognitive effects of anxiety may include thoughts about suspected dangers, such as an irrational fear of dying or having a heart attack, when in reality all one is experiencing is mild chest pain, for example.

The physiological symptoms of anxiety may include:
*Neurological, as headache, paresthesias, fasciculations, vertigo, or presyncope.
*Digestive, as abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, indigestion, dry mouth, or bolus. Stress hormones released in an anxious state have an impact on bowel function and can manifest physical symptoms that may contribute to or exacerbate IBS.
*Respiratory, as shortness of breath or sighing breathing.
*Cardiac, as palpitations, tachycardia, or chest pain.
*Muscular, as fatigue, tremors, or tetany.
*Cutaneous, as perspiration, or itchy skin.
*Uro-genital, as frequent urination, urinary urgency, dyspareunia, or impotence, chronic pelvic pain syndrome.

==Types==
There are various types of anxiety. Existential anxiety can occur when a person faces angst, an existential crisis, or nihilistic feelings. People can also face mathematical anxiety, somatic anxiety, stage fright, or test anxiety. Social anxiety refers to a fear of rejection and negative evaluation (being judged) by other people.

===Existential===

The philosopher Søren Kierkegaard, in &quot;The Concept of Anxiety&quot; (1844), described anxiety or dread associated with the &quot;dizziness of freedom&quot; and suggested the possibility for positive resolution of anxiety through the self-conscious exercise of responsibility and choosing. In &quot;Art and Artist&quot; (1932), the psychologist Otto Rank wrote that the psychological trauma of birth was the pre-eminent human symbol of existential anxiety and encompasses the creative person&#x27;s simultaneous fear of – and desire for – separation, individuation, and differentiation.

The theologian Paul Tillich characterized existential anxiety as &quot;the state in which a being is aware of its possible nonbeing&quot; and he listed three categories for the nonbeing and resulting anxiety: ontic (fate and death), moral (guilt and condemnation), and spiritual (emptiness and meaninglessness). According to Tillich, the last of these three types of existential anxiety, i.e. spiritual anxiety, is predominant in modern times while the others were predominant in earlier periods. Tillich argues that this anxiety can be accepted as part of the human condition or it can be resisted but with negative consequences. In its pathological form, spiritual anxiety may tend to &quot;drive the person toward the creation of certitude in systems of meaning which are supported by tradition and authority&quot; even though such &quot;undoubted certitude is not built on the rock of reality&quot;.

According to Viktor Frankl, the author of &quot;Man&#x27;s Search for Meaning&quot;, when a person is faced with extreme mortal dangers, the most basic of all human wishes is to find a meaning of life to combat the &quot;trauma of nonbeing&quot; as death is near.

Depending on the source of the threat, psychoanalytic theory distinguishes three types of anxiety: realistic, neurotic and moral.

===Test, performance, and competitive===
==== Test ====

According to Yerkes-Dodson law, an optimal level of arousal is necessary to best complete a task such as an exam, performance, or competitive event. However, when the anxiety or level of arousal exceeds that optimum, the result is a decline in performance.

Test anxiety is the uneasiness, apprehension, or nervousness felt by students who have a fear of failing an exam. Students who have test anxiety may experience any of the following: the association of grades with personal worth; fear of embarrassment by a teacher; fear of alienation from parents or friends; time pressures; or feeling a loss of control. Sweating, dizziness, headaches, racing heartbeats, nausea, fidgeting, uncontrollable crying or laughing and drumming on a desk are all common. Because test anxiety hinges on fear of negative evaluation, debate exists as to whether test anxiety is itself a unique anxiety disorder or whether it is a specific type of social phobia. The DSM-IV classifies test anxiety as a type of social phobia.

Research indicates that test anxiety among U.S. high-school and college students has been rising since the late 1950s. Test anxiety remains a challenge for students, regardless of age, and has considerable physiological and psychological impacts. Management of test anxiety focuses on achieving relaxation and developing mechanisms to manage anxiety. The routine practice of slow, Device-Guided Breathing (DGB) is a
major component of behavioral treatments for anxiety conditions.

==== Performance and competitive ====

Performance anxiety and competitive anxiety () happen when an individual&#x27;s performance is measured against others. An important distinction between competitive and non-competitive anxiety is that competitive anxiety makes people view their performance as a threat. As a result, they experience a drop in their ordinary ability, whether physical or mental, due to that perceived stress.

Competitive anxiety is caused by a range of internal factors including high expectations, outside pressure, lack of experience, and external factors like the location of a competition. It commonly occurs in those participating in high pressure activities like sports and debates. Some common symptoms of competitive anxiety include muscle tension, fatigue, weakness, sense of panic, apprehensiveness, and panic attacks.

There are 4 major theories of how anxiety affects performance: Drive theory, Inverted U theory, Reversal theory, and The Zone of Optimal Functioning theory.

&quot;Drive theory&quot; believes that anxiety is positive and performance improves proportionally to the level of anxiety. This theory is not well accepted.

The &quot;Inverted U theory&quot; is based on the idea that performance peaks at a moderate stress level. It is called Inverted U theory because the graph that plots performance against anxiety looks like an inverted &quot;U&quot;.

&quot;Reversal theory&quot; suggests that performance increases in relation to the individual&#x27;s interpretation of their arousal levels. If they believed their physical arousal level would help them, their performance would increase, if they didn&#x27;t, their performance would decrease. For example: Athletes were shown to worry more when focusing on results and perfection rather than the effort and growth involved.

The &quot;Zone of Optimal Functioning theory&quot; proposes that there is a zone where positive and negative emotions are in a balance which lead to feelings of dissociation and intense concentration, optimizing the individual&#x27;s performance levels.

===Stranger, social, and intergroup anxiety===
Humans generally require social acceptance and thus sometimes dread the disapproval of others. Apprehension of being judged by others may cause anxiety in social environments.

Anxiety during social interactions, particularly between strangers, is common among young people. It may persist into adulthood and become social anxiety or social phobia. &quot;Stranger anxiety&quot; in small children is not considered a phobia. In adults, an excessive fear of other people is not a developmentally common stage; it is called social anxiety. According to Cutting, social phobics do not fear the crowd but the fact that they may be judged negatively.

Social anxiety varies in degree and severity. For some people, it is characterized by experiencing discomfort or awkwardness during physical social contact (e.g. embracing, shaking hands, etc.), while in other cases it can lead to a fear of interacting with unfamiliar people altogether. Those with this condition may restrict their lifestyles to accommodate the anxiety, minimizing social interaction whenever possible. Social anxiety also forms a core aspect of certain personality disorders, including avoidant personality disorder.

To the extent that a person is fearful of social encounters with unfamiliar others, some people may experience anxiety particularly during interactions with outgroup members, or people who share different group memberships (i.e., by race, ethnicity, class, gender, etc.). Depending on the nature of the antecedent relations, cognitions, and situational factors, intergroup contact may be stressful and lead to feelings of anxiety. This apprehension or fear of contact with outgroup members is often called interracial or intergroup anxiety.

As is the case with the more generalized forms of social anxiety, intergroup anxiety has behavioral, cognitive, and affective effects. For instance, increases in schematic processing and simplified information processing can occur when anxiety is high. Indeed, such is consistent with related work on attentional bias in implicit memory. Additionally recent research has found that implicit racial evaluations (i.e. automatic prejudiced attitudes) can be amplified during intergroup interaction. Negative experiences have been illustrated in producing not only negative expectations, but also avoidant, or antagonistic, behavior such as hostility. Furthermore, when compared to anxiety levels and cognitive effort (e.g., impression management and self-presentation) in intragroup contexts, levels and depletion of resources may be exacerbated in the intergroup situation.

===Trait===
Anxiety can be either a short-term &quot;state&quot; or a long-term &quot;personality trait&quot;. Trait anxiety reflects a stable tendency across the lifespan of responding with acute, state anxiety in the anticipation of threatening situations (whether they are actually deemed threatening or not). A meta-analysis showed that a high level of neuroticism is a risk factor for development of anxiety symptoms and disorders. Such anxiety may be conscious or unconscious.

Personality can also be a trait leading to anxiety and depression and their persistence. Through experience, many find it difficult to collect themselves due to their own personal nature.

=== Choice or decision ===
Anxiety induced by the need to choose between similar options is recognized as a problem for some individuals and for organizations. In 2004, Capgemini wrote: &quot;Today we&#x27;re all faced with greater choice, more competition and less time to consider our options or seek out the right advice.&quot; Overthinking a choice is called analysis paralysis.

In a decision context, unpredictability or uncertainty may trigger emotional responses in anxious individuals that systematically alter decision-making. There are primarily two forms of this anxiety type. The first form refers to a choice in which there are multiple potential outcomes with known or calculable probabilities. The second form refers to the uncertainty and ambiguity related to a decision context in which there are multiple possible outcomes with unknown probabilities.

===Panic disorder===
Panic disorder may share symptoms of stress and anxiety, but it is actually very different. Panic disorder is an anxiety disorder that occurs without any triggers. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, this disorder can be distinguished by unexpected and repeated episodes of intense fear. Someone with panic disorder will eventually develop constant fear of another attack and as this progresses it will begin to affect daily functioning and an individual&#x27;s general quality of life. It is reported by the Cleveland Clinic that panic disorder affects 2 to 3 percent of adult Americans and can begin around the time of the teenage and early adult years. Some symptoms include: difficulty breathing, chest pain, dizziness, trembling or shaking, feeling faint, nausea, fear that you are losing control or are about to die. Even though they have these symptoms during an attack, the main symptom is the persistent fear of having future panic attacks.

== Anxiety disorders ==
Anxiety disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by exaggerated feelings of anxiety and fear responses. Anxiety is a worry about future events and fear is a reaction to current events. These feelings may cause physical symptoms, such as a fast heart rate and shakiness. There are a number of anxiety disorders: including generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, panic disorder, and selective mutism. The disorder differs by what results in the symptoms. People often have more than one anxiety disorder.
Anxiety disorders are caused by a complex combination of genetic and environmental factors. To be diagnosed, symptoms typically need to be present for at least six months, be more than would be expected for the situation, and decrease a person&#x27;s ability to function in their daily lives. Other problems that may result in similar symptoms include hyperthyroidism, heart disease, caffeine, alcohol, or cannabis use, and withdrawal from certain drugs, among others.
Without treatment, anxiety disorders tend to remain. Treatment may include lifestyle changes, counselling, and medications. Counselling is typically with a type of cognitive behavioral therapy. Medications, such as antidepressants or beta blockers, may improve symptoms. A 2023 review found that regular physical activity is effective for reducing anxiety.
About 12% of people are affected by an anxiety disorder in a given year and between 12% and 30% are affected at some point in their life. They occur about twice as often in women than they do in men, and generally begin before the age of 25. The most common anxiety disorders are specific phobias, which affect nearly 12% of people, and social anxiety disorder, which affects 10% of people at some point in their life. They affect those between the ages of 15 and 35 the most and become less common after the age of 55. Rates appear to be higher in the United States and Europe.

===Short- and long-term anxiety===
Anxiety can be either a short-term &quot;state&quot; or a long-term &quot;trait&quot;. Whereas trait anxiety represents worrying about future events, anxiety disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by feelings of anxiety and fears.

===Four ways to be anxious===
In his book &quot;Anxious: The Modern Mind in the Age of Anxiety&quot; Joseph LeDoux examines four experiences of anxiety through a brain-based lens:

# In the presence of an existing or imminent external threat, you worry about the event and its implications for your physical and/or psychological well-being. When a threat signal occurs, it signifies either that danger is present or near in space and time or that it might be coming in the future. Nonconscious threats processing by the brain activates defensive survival circuits, resulting in changes in information processing in the brain, controlled in part by increases in arousal and behavioral and physiological responses in the body that then produce signals that feed back to the brain and complement the physiological changes there, intensifying them and extending their duration.
# When you notice body sensations, you worry about what they might mean for your physical and/or psychological well-being. The trigger stimulus does not have to be an external stimulus but can be an internal one, as some people are particularly sensitive to body signals.
# Thoughts and memories may lead to you to worry about your physical and/or psychological well-being. We do not need to be in the presence of an external or internal stimulus to be anxious. An episodic memory of a past trauma or of a panic attack in the past is sufficient to activate the defence circuits.
# Thoughts and memories may result in existential dread, such as worry about leading a meaningful life or the eventuality of death. Examples are contemplations of whether one&#x27;s life has been meaningful, the inevitability of death, or the difficulty of making decisions that have a moral value. These do not necessarily activate defensive systems; they are more or less pure forms of cognitive anxiety.

==Co-morbidity==
Anxiety disorders often occur with other mental health disorders, particularly major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, eating disorders, or certain personality disorders. It also commonly occurs with personality traits such as neuroticism. This observed co-occurrence is partly due to genetic and environmental influences shared between these traits and anxiety.

It is common for those with obsessive–compulsive disorder to experience anxiety. Anxiety is also commonly found in those who experience panic disorders, phobic anxiety disorders, severe stress, dissociative disorders, somatoform disorders, and some neurotic disorders.
Anxiety has also been linked to the experience of intrusive thoughts. Studies have revealed that individuals who experience high levels of anxiety (also known as clinical anxiety) are highly vulnerable to the experience of intense intrusive thoughts or psychological disorders that are characterised by intrusive thoughts.

==Risk factors==

Anxiety disorders are partly genetic, with twin studies suggesting 30-40% genetic influence on individual differences in anxiety. Environmental factors are also important. Twin studies show that individual-specific environments have a large influence on anxiety, whereas shared environmental influences (environments that affect twins in the same way) operate during childhood but decline through adolescence. Specific measured &#x27;environments&#x27; that have been associated with anxiety include child abuse, family history of mental health disorders, and poverty. Anxiety is also associated with drug use, including alcohol, caffeine, and benzodiazepines, which are often prescribed to treat anxiety.

===Neuroanatomy===
Neural circuitry involving the amygdala, which regulates emotions like anxiety and fear, stimulating the HPA axis and sympathetic nervous system, and hippocampus, which is implicated in emotional memory along with the amygdala, is thought to underlie anxiety. People who have anxiety tend to show high activity in response to emotional stimuli in the amygdala. Some writers believe that excessive anxiety can lead to an overpotentiation of the limbic system (which includes the amygdala and nucleus accumbens), giving increased future anxiety, but this does not appear to have been proven.

Research upon adolescents who as infants had been highly apprehensive, vigilant, and fearful finds that their nucleus accumbens is more sensitive than that in other people when deciding to make an action that determined whether they received a reward. This suggests a link between circuits responsible for fear and also reward in anxious people. As researchers note, &quot;a sense of &#x27;responsibility&#x27;, or self-agency, in a context of uncertainty (probabilistic outcomes) drives the neural system underlying appetitive motivation (i.e., nucleus accumbens) more strongly in temperamentally inhibited than noninhibited adolescents&quot;.

==== The gut-brain axis ====
The microbes of the gut can connect with the brain to affect anxiety. There are various pathways along which this communication can take place. One is through the major neurotransmitters. The gut microbes such as &quot;Bifidobacterium&quot; and &quot;Bacillus&quot; produce the neurotransmitters GABA and dopamine, respectively. The neurotransmitters signal to the nervous system of the gastrointestinal tract, and those signals will be carried to the brain through the vagus nerve or the spinal system. This is demonstrated by the fact that altering the microbiome has shown anxiety- and depression-reducing effects in mice, but not in subjects without vagus nerves.

Another key pathway is the HPA axis, as mentioned above. The microbes can control the levels of cytokines in the body, and altering cytokine levels creates direct effects on areas of the brain such as the hypothalamus, the area that triggers HPA axis activity. The HPA axis regulates production of cortisol, a hormone that takes part in the body&#x27;s stress response. When HPA activity spikes, cortisol levels increase, processing and reducing anxiety in stressful situations. These pathways, as well as the specific effects of individual taxa of microbes, are not yet completely clear, but the communication between the gut microbiome and the brain is undeniable, as is the ability of these pathways to alter anxiety levels.

With this communication comes the potential to treat. Prebiotics and probiotics have been shown to reduce anxiety. For example, experiments in which mice were given fructo- and galacto-oligosaccharide prebiotics and &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; probiotics have both demonstrated a capability to reduce anxiety. In humans, results are not as concrete, but promising.

===Genetics===
Genetics and family history (e.g. parental anxiety) may put an individual at increased risk of an anxiety disorder, but generally external stimuli will trigger its onset or exacerbation. Estimates of genetic influence on anxiety, based on studies of twins, range from 25 to 40% depending on the specific type and age-group under study. For example, genetic differences account for about 43% of variance in panic disorder and 28% in generalized anxiety disorder. Longitudinal twin studies have shown the moderate stability of anxiety from childhood through to adulthood is mainly influenced by stability in genetic influence. When investigating how anxiety is passed on from parents to children, it is important to account for sharing of genes as well as environments, for example using the intergenerational children-of-twins design.

Many studies in the past used a candidate gene approach to test whether single genes were associated with anxiety. These investigations were based on hypotheses about how certain known genes influence neurotransmitters (such as serotonin and norepinephrine) and hormones (such as cortisol) that are implicated in anxiety. None of these findings are well replicated, with the possible exception of TMEM132D, COMT and MAO-A. The epigenetic signature of &quot;BDNF&quot;, a gene that codes for a protein called &quot;brain derived neurotrophic factor&quot; that is found in the brain, has also been associated with anxiety and specific patterns of neural activity. and a receptor gene for &quot;BDNF&quot; called &quot;NTRK2&quot; was associated with anxiety in a large genome-wide investigation. The reason that most candidate gene findings have not replicated is that anxiety is a complex trait that is influenced by many genomic variants, each of which has a small effect on its own. Increasingly, studies of anxiety are using a hypothesis-free approach to look for parts of the genome that are implicated in anxiety using big enough samples to find associations with variants that have small effects. The largest explorations of the common genetic architecture of anxiety have been facilitated by the UK Biobank, the ANGST consortium and the CRC Fear, Anxiety and Anxiety Disorders.

====Epigenetics====
===Medical conditions===
Many medical conditions can cause anxiety. This includes conditions that affect the ability to breathe, like COPD and asthma, and the difficulty in breathing that often occurs near death. Conditions that cause abdominal pain or chest pain can cause anxiety and may in some cases be a somatization of anxiety; the same is true for some sexual dysfunctions. Conditions that affect the face or the skin can cause social anxiety especially among adolescents, and developmental disabilities often lead to social anxiety for children as well. Life-threatening conditions like cancer also cause anxiety.

Furthermore, certain organic diseases may present with anxiety or symptoms that mimic anxiety. These disorders include certain endocrine diseases (hypo- and hyperthyroidism, hyperprolactinemia), metabolic disorders (diabetes), deficiency states (low levels of vitamin D, B2, B12, folic acid), gastrointestinal diseases (celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, inflammatory bowel disease), heart diseases, blood diseases (anemia), cerebral vascular accidents (transient ischemic attack, stroke), and brain degenerative diseases (Parkinson&#x27;s disease, dementia, multiple sclerosis, Huntington&#x27;s disease), among others.

===Substance-induced===
Several drugs can cause or worsen anxiety, whether in intoxication, withdrawal or as side effect. These include alcohol, tobacco, sedatives (including prescription benzodiazepines), opioids (including prescription pain killers and illicit drugs like heroin), stimulants (such as caffeine, cocaine and amphetamines), hallucinogens, and inhalants.

While many often report self-medicating anxiety with these substances, improvements in anxiety from drugs are usually short-lived (with worsening of anxiety in the long term, sometimes with acute anxiety as soon as the drug effects wear off) and tend to be exaggerated. Acute exposure to toxic levels of benzene may cause euphoria, anxiety, and irritability lasting up to 2 weeks after the exposure.

===Psychological===

Poor coping skills (e.g., rigidity/inflexible problem solving, denial, avoidance, impulsivity, extreme self-expectation, negative thoughts, affective instability, and inability to focus on problems) are associated with anxiety. Anxiety is also linked and perpetuated by the person&#x27;s own pessimistic outcome expectancy and how they cope with feedback negativity. Temperament (e.g., neuroticism) and attitudes (e.g. pessimism) have been found to be risk factors for anxiety.

Cognitive distortions such as overgeneralizing, catastrophizing, mind reading, emotional reasoning, binocular trick, and mental filter can result in anxiety. For example, an overgeneralized belief that something bad &quot;always&quot; happens may lead someone to have excessive fears of even minimally risky situations and to avoid benign social situations due to anticipatory anxiety of embarrassment. In addition, those who have high anxiety can also create future stressful life events. Together, these findings suggest that anxious thoughts can lead to anticipatory anxiety as well as stressful events, which in turn cause more anxiety. Such unhealthy thoughts can be targets for successful treatment with cognitive therapy.

Psychodynamic theory posits that anxiety is often the result of opposing unconscious wishes or fears that manifest via maladaptive defense mechanisms (such as suppression, repression, anticipation, regression, somatization, passive aggression, dissociation) that develop to adapt to problems with early objects (e.g., caregivers) and empathic failures in childhood. For example, persistent parental discouragement of anger may result in repression/suppression of angry feelings which manifests as gastrointestinal distress (somatization) when provoked by another while the anger remains unconscious and outside the individual&#x27;s awareness. Such conflicts can be targets for successful treatment with psychodynamic therapy. While psychodynamic therapy tends to explore the underlying roots of anxiety, cognitive behavioral therapy has also been shown to be a successful treatment for anxiety by altering irrational thoughts and unwanted behaviors.

====Evolutionary psychology====
An evolutionary psychology explanation is that increased anxiety serves the purpose of increased vigilance regarding potential threats in the environment as well as increased tendency to take proactive actions regarding such possible threats. This may cause false positive reactions but an individual with anxiety may also avoid real threats. This may explain why anxious people are less likely to die due to accidents. There is ample empirical evidence that anxiety can have adaptive value. Within a school, timid fish are more likely than bold fish to survive a predator.

When people are confronted with unpleasant and potentially harmful stimuli such as foul odors or tastes, PET-scans show increased blood flow in the amygdala. In these studies, the participants also reported moderate anxiety. This might indicate that anxiety is a protective mechanism designed to prevent the organism from engaging in potentially harmful behaviors.

===Social===
Social risk factors for anxiety include a history of trauma (e.g., physical, sexual or emotional abuse or assault), bullying, early life experiences and parenting factors (e.g., rejection, lack of warmth, high hostility, harsh discipline, high parental negative affect, anxious childrearing, modelling of dysfunctional and drug-abusing behaviour, discouragement of emotions, poor socialization, poor attachment, and child abuse and neglect), cultural factors (e.g., stoic families/cultures, persecuted minorities including those with disabilities), and socioeconomics (e.g., uneducated, unemployed, impoverished although developed countries have higher rates of anxiety disorders than developing countries). 
A 2019 comprehensive systematic review of over 50 studies showed that food insecurity in the United States is strongly associated with depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders. Food-insecure individuals had an almost 3 fold risk increase of testing positive for anxiety when compared to food-secure individuals.

====Gender socialization====
Contextual factors that are thought to contribute to anxiety include gender socialization and learning experiences. In particular, learning mastery (the degree to which people perceive their lives to be under their own control) and instrumentality, which includes such traits as self-confidence, self-efficacy, independence, and competitiveness fully mediate the relation between gender and anxiety. That is, though gender differences in anxiety exist, with higher levels of anxiety in women compared to men, gender socialization and learning mastery explain these gender differences.

==Treatment==

The first step in the management of a person with anxiety symptoms involves evaluating the possible presence of an underlying medical cause, the recognition of which is essential in order to decide the correct treatment. Anxiety symptoms may mask an organic disease, or appear associated with or as a result of a medical disorder.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective for anxiety disorders and is a first line treatment. CBT appears to be equally effective when carried out via the internet. While evidence for mental health apps is promising, it is preliminary.

Anxiety often affects relationships, and interpersonal psychotherapy addresses these issues by improving communication and relationship skills.

Psychopharmacological treatment can be used in parallel to CBT or can be used alone. As a general rule, most anxiety disorders respond well to first-line agents. Such drugs, also used as anti-depressants, are the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, that work by blocking the reuptake of specific neurotransmitters and resulting in the increase in availability of these neurotransmitters. Additionally, benzodiazepines are often prescribed to individuals with anxiety disorder. Benzodiazepines produce an anxiolytic response by modulating GABA and increasing its receptor binding. A third common treatment involves a category of drug known as serotonin agonists. This category of drug works by initiating a physiological response at 5-HT1A receptor by increasing the action of serotonin at this receptor. Other treatment options include pregabalin, tricyclic antidepressants, and moclobemide, among others.

Anxiety is considered to be a serious psychiatric illness that has an unknown true pervasiveness due to affected individuals not asking for proper treatment or aid, and due to professionals missing the diagnosis.

==Prevention==
The above risk factors give natural avenues for prevention. A 2017 review found that psychological or educational interventions have a small yet statistically significant benefit for the prevention of anxiety in varied population types.

==Pathophysiology==
Anxiety disorder appears to be a genetically inherited neurochemical dysfunction that may involve autonomic imbalance; decreased GABA-ergic tone; allelic polymorphism of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene; increased adenosine receptor function; increased cortisol.

In the central nervous system (CNS), the major mediators of the symptoms of anxiety disorders appear to be norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Other neurotransmitters and peptides, such as corticotropin-releasing factor, may be involved. Peripherally, the autonomic nervous system, especially the sympathetic nervous system, mediates many of the symptoms. Increased flow in the right parahippocampal region and reduced serotonin type 1A receptor binding in the anterior and posterior cingulate and raphe of patients are the diagnostic factors for prevalence of anxiety disorder.

The amygdala is central to the processing of fear and anxiety, and its function may be disrupted in anxiety disorders. Anxiety processing in the basolateral amygdala has been implicated with expansion of dendritic arborization of the amygdaloid neurons. SK2 potassium channels mediate inhibitory influence on action potentials and reduce arborization.

<doc id="924" wikidata="Q207036" url="?curid=924" title="A. A. Milne">
<text>Alan Alexander Milne (; 18 January 1882 – 31 January 1956) was an English writer best known for his books about the teddy bear Winnie-the-Pooh, as well as children&#x27;s poetry. Milne was primarily a playwright before the huge success of Winnie-the-Pooh overshadowed his previous work. He served as a lieutenant in the Royal Warwickshire Regiment in the First World War and as a captain in the Home Guard in the Second World War.

Milne was the father of bookseller Christopher Robin Milne, upon whom the character Christopher Robin is based. It was during a visit to London Zoo, where Christopher became enamoured with the tame and amiable bear Winnipeg, that Milne was inspired to write the story of Winnie-the-Pooh for his son. Milne bequeathed the original manuscripts of the Winnie-the-Pooh stories to the Wren Library at Trinity College, Cambridge, his alma mater.

==Early life and military career==

Alan Alexander Milne was born in Kilburn, London, to John Vine Milne, who was born in Jamaica, and Sarah Marie Milne (née Heginbotham), on 18 January 1882. He grew up at Henley House School, 6/7 Mortimer Road (now Crescent), Kilburn, a small independent school run by his father. He taught himself to read at the age of two. One of his teachers was H. G. Wells, who taught there in 1889–90. Milne attended Westminster School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied on a mathematics scholarship, graduating with a B.A. in Mathematics in 1903, though he was always interested in writing. He edited and wrote for &quot;Granta&quot;, a student magazine. He collaborated with his brother Kenneth and their articles appeared over the initials AKM. Milne&#x27;s work came to the attention of the leading British humour magazine &quot;Punch&quot;, where Milne was to become a contributor and later an assistant editor. Considered a talented cricket fielder, Milne played for two amateur teams that were largely composed of British writers: the Allahakbarries and the Authors XI. His teammates included fellow writers J. M. Barrie, Arthur Conan Doyle and P. G. Wodehouse.

Milne joined the British Army during World War I and served as an officer in the Royal Warwickshire Regiment. He was commissioned into the 4th Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment, on 1 February 1915 as a second lieutenant (on probation). His commission was confirmed on 20 December 1915. He served on the Somme as a signals officer from July–November 1916, but caught trench fever and was invalided back to England. Having recuperated, he worked as a signals instructor, before being recruited into military intelligence to write propaganda articles for MI7 (b) between 1917 and 1918. He was discharged on 14 February 1919, and settled in Mallord Street, Chelsea. He relinquished his commission on 19 February 1920, retaining the rank of lieutenant.
After the war, he wrote a denunciation of war titled &quot;Peace with Honour&quot; (1934), which he retracted somewhat with 1940&#x27;s &quot;War with Honour&quot;. During World War II, Milne was one of the most prominent critics of fellow English writer (and Authors XI cricket teammate) P. G. Wodehouse, who was captured at his country home in France by the Nazis and imprisoned for a year. Wodehouse made radio broadcasts about his internment, which were broadcast from Berlin. Although the light-hearted broadcasts made fun of the Germans, Milne accused Wodehouse of committing an act of near treason by cooperating with his country&#x27;s enemy. Wodehouse got some revenge on his former friend (e.g. in &quot;The Mating Season&quot;) by creating fatuous parodies of the Christopher Robin poems in some of his later stories, and claiming that Milne &quot;was probably jealous of all other writers... But I loved his stuff.&quot;

Milne married Dorothy &quot;Daphne&quot; de Sélincourt (1890–1971) in 1913 and their son Christopher Robin Milne was born in 1920. In 1925, Milne bought a country home, Cotchford Farm, in Hartfield, East Sussex.

During World War II, Milne was a captain in the British Home Guard in Hartfield &amp; Forest Row, insisting on being plain &quot;Mr. Milne&quot; to the members of his platoon. He retired to the farm after a stroke and brain surgery in 1952 left him an invalid; and by August 1953, &quot;he seemed very old and disenchanted.&quot; Milne died in January 1956, aged 74.

== Literary career ==
===1903 to 1925===

After graduating from Cambridge University in 1903, A. A. Milne contributed humorous verse and whimsical essays to &quot;Punch&quot;, joining the staff in 1906 and becoming an assistant editor.

During this period he published 18 plays and three novels, including the murder mystery &quot;The Red House Mystery&quot; (1922). His son was born in August 1920 and in 1924 Milne produced a collection of children&#x27;s poems, &quot;When We Were Very Young&quot;, which were illustrated by &quot;Punch&quot; staff cartoonist E. H. Shepard. A collection of short stories for children &quot;A Gallery of Children&quot;, and other stories that became part of the Winnie-the-Pooh books, were first published in 1925.

Milne was an early screenwriter for the nascent British film industry, writing four stories filmed in 1920 for the company Minerva Films (founded in 1920 by the actor Leslie Howard and his friend and story editor Adrian Brunel). These were &quot;The Bump&quot;, starring Aubrey Smith; &quot;Twice Two&quot;; &quot;Five Pound Reward&quot;; and &quot;Bookworms&quot;. Some of these films survive in the archives of the British Film Institute. Milne had met Howard when the actor starred in Milne&#x27;s play &quot;Mr Pim Passes By&quot; in London.

Looking back on this period (in 1926), Milne observed that when he told his agent that he was going to write a detective story, he was told that what the country wanted from a &quot;&quot;Punch&quot; humorist&quot; was a humorous story; when two years later he said he was writing nursery rhymes, his agent and publisher were convinced he should write another detective story; and after another two years, he was being told that writing a detective story would be in the worst of taste given the demand for children&#x27;s books. He concluded that &quot;the only excuse which I have yet discovered for writing anything is that I want to write it; and I should be as proud to be delivered of a Telephone Directory &quot;con amore&quot; as I should be ashamed to create a Blank Verse Tragedy at the bidding of others.&quot;

===1926 to 1928===

Milne is most famous for his two &quot;Pooh&quot; books about a boy named Christopher Robin after his son, Christopher Robin Milne (1920–1996), and various characters inspired by his son&#x27;s stuffed animals, most notably the bear named Winnie-the-Pooh. Christopher Robin Milne&#x27;s stuffed bear, originally named Edward, was renamed Winnie after a Canadian black bear named Winnie (after Winnipeg), which was used as a military mascot in World War I, and left to London Zoo during the war. &quot;The Pooh&quot; comes from a swan the young Milne named &quot;Pooh&quot;. E. H. Shepard illustrated the original Pooh books, using his own son&#x27;s teddy Growler (&quot;a magnificent bear&quot;) as the model. The rest of Christopher Robin Milne&#x27;s toys, Piglet, Eeyore, Kanga, Roo and Tigger, were incorporated into A. A. Milne&#x27;s stories, and two more characters – Rabbit and Owl – were created by Milne&#x27;s imagination. Christopher Robin Milne&#x27;s own toys are now on display in New York where 750,000 people visit them every year.
The fictional Hundred Acre Wood of the Pooh stories derives from Five Hundred Acre Wood in Ashdown Forest in East Sussex, South East England, where the Pooh stories were set. Milne lived on the northern edge of the forest at Cotchford Farm, , and took his son on walking trips there. E. H. Shepard drew on the landscapes of Ashdown Forest as inspiration for many of the illustrations he provided for the Pooh books. The adult Christopher Robin commented: &quot;Pooh&#x27;s Forest and Ashdown Forest are identical.&quot; Popular tourist locations at Ashdown Forest include: &quot;Galleon&#x27;s Lap&quot;, &quot;The Enchanted Place&quot;, the &quot;Heffalump Trap&quot; and &quot;Lone Pine&quot;, &quot;Eeyore&#x27;s Sad and Gloomy Place&quot;, and the wooden &quot;Pooh Bridge&quot; where Pooh and Piglet invented Poohsticks.

Not yet known as Pooh, he made his first appearance in a poem, &quot;Teddy Bear&quot;, published in &quot;Punch&quot; magazine in February 1924 and republished that year in &quot;When We Were Very Young&quot;. Pooh first appeared in the &quot;London Evening News&quot; on Christmas Eve, 1925, in a story called &quot;The Wrong Sort of Bees&quot;. &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; was published in 1926, followed by &quot;The House at Pooh Corner&quot; in 1928. A second collection of nursery rhymes, &quot;Now We Are Six&quot;, was published in 1927. All four books were illustrated by E. H. Shepard. Milne also published four plays in this period. He also &quot;gallantly stepped forward&quot; to contribute a quarter of the costs of dramatising P. G. Wodehouse&#x27;s &quot;A Damsel in Distress&quot;. &quot;The World of Pooh&quot; won the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award in 1958.

===1929 onward===
The success of his children&#x27;s books was to become a source of considerable annoyance to Milne, whose self-avowed aim was to write whatever he pleased and who had, until then, found a ready audience for each change of direction: he had freed pre-war &quot;Punch&quot; from its ponderous facetiousness; he had made a considerable reputation as a playwright (like his idol J. M. Barrie) on both sides of the Atlantic; he had produced a witty piece of detective writing in &quot;The Red House Mystery&quot; (although this was severely criticised by Raymond Chandler for the implausibility of its plot in his essay &quot;The Simple Art of Murder&quot; in the eponymous collection that appeared in 1950). But once Milne had, in his own words, &quot;said goodbye to all that in 70,000 words&quot; (the approximate length of his four principal children&#x27;s books), he had no intention of producing any reworkings lacking in originality, given that one of the sources of inspiration, his son, was growing older.

Another reason Milne stopped writing children&#x27;s books, and especially about Winnie-the-Pooh, was that he felt &quot;amazement and disgust&quot; over the immense fame his son was exposed to, and said that &quot;I feel that the legal Christopher Robin has already had more publicity than I want for him. I do not want CR Milne to ever wish that his name were Charles Robert.&quot;

In his literary home, &quot;Punch&quot;, where the &quot;When We Were Very Young&quot; verses had first appeared, Methuen continued to publish whatever Milne wrote, including the long poem &quot;The Norman Church&quot; and an assembly of articles entitled &quot;Year In, Year Out&quot; (which Milne likened to a benefit night for the author).

In 1929, Milne adapted Kenneth Grahame&#x27;s novel &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; for the stage as &quot;Toad of Toad Hall&quot;. The title was an implicit admission that such chapters as Chapter 7, &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,&quot; could not survive translation to the theatre. A special introduction written by Milne is included in some editions of Grahame&#x27;s novel. It was first performed at the Playhouse Theatre, Liverpool, on 21 December 1929 before it made its West End debut the following year at the Lyric Theatre on 17 December 1930. The play was revived in the West End from 1931 to 1935, and since the 1960s there have been West End revivals during the Christmas season; actors who have performed in the play include Judi Dench and Ian McKellen.

Milne and his wife became estranged from their son, who came to resent what he saw as his father&#x27;s exploitation of his childhood and came to hate the books that had thrust him into the public eye. Christopher&#x27;s marriage to his first cousin, Lesley de Sélincourt, distanced him still further from his parents – Lesley&#x27;s father and Christopher&#x27;s mother had not spoken to each other for 30 years.

==Death and legacy==
=== Commemoration ===
A. A. Milne died at his home in Hartfield, Sussex, on 31 January 1956, aged 74. A memorial service took place on 10 February at All Hallows-by-the-Tower church in London.

The rights to A. A. Milne&#x27;s Pooh books were left to four beneficiaries: his family, the Royal Literary Fund, Westminster School and the Garrick Club. After Milne&#x27;s death in 1956, his widow sold her rights to the Pooh characters to Stephen Slesinger, whose widow sold the rights after Slesinger&#x27;s death to Walt Disney Productions, which has made many Pooh cartoon movies, a Disney Channel television show, as well as Pooh-related merchandise. In 2001, the other beneficiaries sold their interest in the estate to the Disney Corporation for $350m. Previously Disney had been paying twice-yearly royalties to these beneficiaries. The estate of E. H. Shepard also received a sum in the deal. The UK copyright on the text of the original Winnie the Pooh books expires on 1 January 2027; at the beginning of the year after the 70th anniversary of the author&#x27;s death (PMA-70), and has already expired in those countries with a PMA-50 rule. This applies to all of Milne&#x27;s works except those first published posthumously. The illustrations in the Pooh books will remain under copyright until the same amount of time after the illustrator&#x27;s death has passed; in the UK, this will be 1 January 2047.

In the US, copyright on the four children&#x27;s books (including the illustrations) expired 95 years after publication of each of the books. Specifically: copyright on the book &quot;When We Were Very Young&quot; expired in 2020; copyright on the book &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; expired in 2022; copyright on the book &quot;Now We Are Six&quot; expired in 2023; and copyright on the book &quot;The House at Pooh Corner&quot; expired in 2024.

In 2008, a collection of original illustrations featuring Winnie-the-Pooh and his animal friends sold for more than £1.2 million at auction at Sotheby&#x27;s, London. &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine ranked Winnie the Pooh the most valuable fictional character in 2002; Winnie the Pooh merchandising products alone had annual sales of more than $5.9 billion. In 2005, Winnie the Pooh generated $6 billion, a figure surpassed only by Mickey Mouse.

A memorial plaque in Ashdown Forest, unveiled by Christopher Robin in 1979, commemorates the work of A. A. Milne and Shepard in creating the world of Pooh. The inscription states they &quot;captured the magic of Ashdown Forest, and gave it to the world&quot;. Milne once wrote of Ashdown Forest: &quot;In that enchanted place on the top of the forest a little boy and his bear will always be playing.&quot;

In 2003, &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; was ranked number 7 on the BBC&#x27;s The Big Read poll which determined the UK&#x27;s &quot;best-loved novels&quot;. In 2006, Winnie-the-Pooh received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, marking the 80th birthday of Milne&#x27;s creation.

Marking the 90th anniversary of Milne&#x27;s creation of the character, and the 90th birthday of Queen Elizabeth II, &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh Meets the Queen&quot; (2016) sees Pooh meet the Queen at Buckingham Palace. The illustrated and audio adventure is narrated by the actor Jim Broadbent. Also in 2016, a new character, a Penguin, was unveiled in &quot;The Best Bear in All the World&quot;, which was inspired by a long-lost photograph of Milne and his son Christopher with a toy penguin.

An exhibition entitled &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh: Exploring a Classic&quot; appeared at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London from 9 December 2017 to 8 April 2018.

The composer Harold Fraser-Simson, a near neighbour, produced six books of Milne songs between 1924 and 1932. The poems have been parodied many times, including in the books &quot;When We Were Rather Older&quot; and &quot;Now We Are Sixty&quot;. The 1963 film &quot;The King&#x27;s Breakfast&quot; was based on Milne&#x27;s poem of the same name.

Milne has been portrayed in television and film. Domhnall Gleeson plays him in &quot;Goodbye Christopher Robin&quot;, a 2017 biographical drama film. In the 2018 fantasy film &quot;Christopher Robin&quot;, an extension of the Disney Winnie the Pooh franchise, Tristan Sturrock plays Milne, and filming took place at Ashdown Forest.

An elementary school in Houston, Texas, operated by the Houston Independent School District (HISD), is named after Milne. The school, A. A. Milne Elementary School in Brays Oaks, opened in 1991.

== Archive ==
The original manuscripts for &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; and &quot;The House at Pooh Corner&quot; are archived at Trinity College Library, Cambridge.

The bulk of A. A. Milne&#x27;s papers are housed at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin. The collection, established at the centre in 1964, consists of manuscript drafts and fragments for over 150 of Milne&#x27;s works, as well as correspondence, legal documents, genealogical records, and some personal effects. The library division holds several books formerly belonging to Milne and his wife Dorothy. The center also has small collections of correspondence from Christopher Robin Milne and Milne&#x27;s frequent illustrator E. H. Shepard.

==Religious views==
Milne did not speak out much on the subject of religion, although he used religious terms to explain his decision, while remaining a pacifist, to join the British Home Guard. He wrote: &quot;In fighting Hitler we are truly fighting the Devil, the Anti-Christ ... Hitler was a crusader against God.&quot;

His best known comment on the subject was recalled on his death:
He wrote in the poem &quot;Explained&quot;:

He also wrote in the poem &quot;Vespers&quot;:

<text>Asociación Alumni, usually just Alumni, is an Argentine rugby union club located in Tortuguitas, Greater Buenos Aires. The senior squad currently competes at Top 12, the first division of the Unión de Rugby de Buenos Aires league system.

The club has ties with former football club Alumni because both were established by Buenos Aires English High School students.

==History==
===Background===

The first club with the name &quot;Alumni&quot; played association football, having been found in 1898 by students of Buenos Aires English High School (BAEHS) along with director Alexander Watson Hutton. Originally under the name &quot;English High School A.C.&quot;, the team would be later obliged by the Association to change its name, therefore &quot;Alumni&quot; was chosen, following a proposal by Carlos Bowers, a former student of the school.

Alumni was the most successful team during the first years of Argentine football, winning 10 of 14 league championships contested. Alumni is still considered the first great football team in the country. Alumni was reorganised in 1908, &quot;in order to encourage people to practise all kinds of sports, specially football&quot;. This was the last try to develop itself as a sports club rather than just as a football team, as Lomas, Belgrano and Quilmes had successfully done in the past, but the efforts were not enough. Alumni played its last game in 1911 and was definitely dissolved on April 24, 1913.

===Rebirth through rugby===
In 1951, two guards of the BAEHS, Daniel Ginhson (also a former player of Buenos Aires F.C.) and Guillermo Cubelli, supported by the school&#x27;s alumni and fathers of the students, decided to establish a club focused on rugby union exclusively. Former players of Alumni football club and descendants of other players already dead gave their permission to use the name &quot;Alumni&quot;.
On December 13, in a meeting presided by Carlos Bowers himself (who had proposed the name &quot;Alumni&quot; to the original football team 50 years before), the club was officially established under the name &quot;Asociación Juvenil Alumni&quot;, also adopting the same colors as its predecessor.

The team achieved good results and in 1960 the club presented a team that won the third division of the Buenos Aires league, reaching the second division. Since then, Alumni has played at the highest level of Argentine rugby and its rivalry with Belgrano Athletic Club is one of the fiercest local derbies in Buenos Aires. Alumni would later climb up to the first division winning 5 titles: 4 consecutive between 1989 and 1992, and the other in 2001.

In 2002, Alumni won its first Nacional de Clubes title, defeating Jockey Club de Rosario 23–21 in the final.

<text>An axiom, postulate, or assumption is a statement that is taken to be true, to serve as a premise or starting point for further reasoning and arguments. The word comes from the Ancient Greek word (), meaning &#x27;that which is thought worthy or fit&#x27; or &#x27;that which commends itself as evident&#x27;.

The precise definition varies across fields of study. In classic philosophy, an axiom is a statement that is so evident or well-established, that it is accepted without controversy or question. In modern logic, an axiom is a premise or starting point for reasoning.

In mathematics, an &quot;axiom&quot; may be a &quot;logical axiom&quot; or a &quot;non-logical axiom&quot;. Logical axioms are taken to be true within the system of logic they define and are often shown in symbolic form (e.g., (&quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;) implies &quot;A&quot;), while non-logical axioms are substantive assertions about the elements of the domain of a specific mathematical theory, for example &quot;a&quot; + 0 = &quot;a&quot; in integer arithmetic.

Non-logical axioms may also be called &quot;postulates&quot;, &quot;assumptions&quot; or &quot;proper axioms&quot;. In most cases, a non-logical axiom is simply a formal logical expression used in deduction to build a mathematical theory, and might or might not be self-evident in nature (e.g., the parallel postulate in Euclidean geometry). To axiomatize a system of knowledge is to show that its claims can be derived from a small, well-understood set of sentences (the axioms), and there are typically many ways to axiomatize a given mathematical domain.

Any axiom is a statement that serves as a starting point from which other statements are logically derived. Whether it is meaningful (and, if so, what it means) for an axiom to be &quot;true&quot; is a subject of debate in the philosophy of mathematics.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;axiom&quot; comes from the Greek word (&quot;axíōma&quot;), a verbal noun from the verb (&quot;axioein&quot;), meaning &quot;to deem worthy&quot;, but also &quot;to require&quot;, which in turn comes from (&quot;áxios&quot;), meaning &quot;being in balance&quot;, and hence &quot;having (the same) value (as)&quot;, &quot;worthy&quot;, &quot;proper&quot;. Among the ancient Greek philosophers and mathematicians, axioms were taken to be immediately evident propositions, foundational and common to many fields of investigation, and self-evidently true without any further argument or proof.

The root meaning of the word &quot;postulate&quot; is to &quot;demand&quot;; for instance, Euclid demands that one agree that some things can be done (e.g., any two points can be joined by a straight line).

Ancient geometers maintained some distinction between axioms and postulates. While commenting on Euclid&#x27;s books, Proclus remarks that &quot;Geminus held that this [4th] Postulate should not be classed as a postulate but as an axiom, since it does not, like the first three Postulates, assert the possibility of some construction but expresses an essential property.&quot; Boethius translated &#x27;postulate&#x27; as &quot;petitio&quot; and called the axioms &quot;notiones communes&quot; but in later manuscripts this usage was not always strictly kept.

==Historical development==

===Early Greeks===
The logico-deductive method whereby conclusions (new knowledge) follow from premises (old knowledge) through the application of sound arguments (syllogisms, rules of inference) was developed by the ancient Greeks, and has become the core principle of modern mathematics. Tautologies excluded, nothing can be deduced if nothing is assumed. Axioms and postulates are thus the basic assumptions underlying a given body of deductive knowledge. They are accepted without demonstration. All other assertions (theorems, in the case of mathematics) must be proven with the aid of these basic assumptions. However, the interpretation of mathematical knowledge has changed from ancient times to the modern, and consequently the terms &quot;axiom&quot; and &quot;postulate&quot; hold a slightly different meaning for the present day mathematician, than they did for Aristotle and Euclid.

The ancient Greeks considered geometry as just one of several sciences, and held the theorems of geometry on par with scientific facts. As such, they developed and used the logico-deductive method as a means of avoiding error, and for structuring and communicating knowledge. Aristotle&#x27;s posterior analytics is a definitive exposition of the classical view.

An &quot;axiom&quot;, in classical terminology, referred to a self-evident assumption common to many branches of science. A good example would be the assertion that:
When an equal amount is taken from equals, an equal amount results.

At the foundation of the various sciences lay certain additional hypotheses that were accepted without proof. Such a hypothesis was termed a &quot;postulate&quot;. While the axioms were common to many sciences, the postulates of each particular science were different. Their validity had to be established by means of real-world experience. Aristotle warns that the content of a science cannot be successfully communicated if the learner is in doubt about the truth of the postulates.

The classical approach is well-illustrated by Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;, where a list of postulates is given (common-sensical geometric facts drawn from our experience), followed by a list of &quot;common notions&quot; (very basic, self-evident assertions).

:;Postulates
:# It is possible to draw a straight line from any point to any other point.
:# It is possible to extend a line segment continuously in both directions.
:# It is possible to describe a circle with any center and any radius.
:# It is true that all right angles are equal to one another.
:# (&quot;Parallel postulate&quot;) It is true that, if a straight line falling on two straight lines make the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, intersect on that side on which are the angles less than the two right angles.

:;Common notions:
:# Things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another.
:# If equals are added to equals, the wholes are equal.
:# If equals are subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal.
:# Things which coincide with one another are equal to one another.
:# The whole is greater than the part.

===Modern development===
A lesson learned by mathematics in the last 150 years is that it is useful to strip the meaning away from the mathematical assertions (axioms, postulates, propositions, theorems) and definitions. One must concede the need for primitive notions, or undefined terms or concepts, in any study. Such abstraction or formalization makes mathematical knowledge more general, capable of multiple different meanings, and therefore useful in multiple contexts. Alessandro Padoa, Mario Pieri, and Giuseppe Peano were pioneers in this movement.

Structuralist mathematics goes further, and develops theories and axioms (e.g. field theory, group theory, topology, vector spaces) without &quot;any&quot; particular application in mind. The distinction between an &quot;axiom&quot; and a &quot;postulate&quot; disappears. The postulates of Euclid are profitably motivated by saying that they lead to a great wealth of geometric facts. The truth of these complicated facts rests on the acceptance of the basic hypotheses. However, by throwing out Euclid&#x27;s fifth postulate, one can get theories that have meaning in wider contexts (e.g., hyperbolic geometry). As such, one must simply be prepared to use labels such as &quot;line&quot; and &quot;parallel&quot; with greater flexibility. The development of hyperbolic geometry taught mathematicians that it is useful to regard postulates as purely formal statements, and not as facts based on experience.

When mathematicians employ the field axioms, the intentions are even more abstract. The propositions of field theory do not concern any one particular application; the mathematician now works in complete abstraction. There are many examples of fields; field theory gives correct knowledge about them all.

It is not correct to say that the axioms of field theory are &quot;propositions that are regarded as true without proof.&quot; Rather, the field axioms are a set of constraints. If any given system of addition and multiplication satisfies these constraints, then one is in a position to instantly know a great deal of extra information about this system.

Modern mathematics formalizes its foundations to such an extent that mathematical theories can be regarded as mathematical objects, and mathematics itself can be regarded as a branch of logic. Frege, Russell, Poincaré, Hilbert, and Gödel are some of the key figures in this development.

Another lesson learned in modern mathematics is to examine purported proofs carefully for hidden assumptions.

In the modern understanding, a set of axioms is any collection of formally stated assertions from which other formally stated assertions follow – by the application of certain well-defined rules. In this view, logic becomes just another formal system. A set of axioms should be consistent; it should be impossible to derive a contradiction from the axioms. A set of axioms should also be non-redundant; an assertion that can be deduced from other axioms need not be regarded as an axiom.

It was the early hope of modern logicians that various branches of mathematics, perhaps all of mathematics, could be derived from a consistent collection of basic axioms. An early success of the formalist program was Hilbert&#x27;s formalization of Euclidean geometry, and the related demonstration of the consistency of those axioms.

In a wider context, there was an attempt to base all of mathematics on Cantor&#x27;s set theory. Here, the emergence of Russell&#x27;s paradox and similar antinomies of naïve set theory raised the possibility that any such system could turn out to be inconsistent.

The formalist project suffered a setback a century ago, when Gödel showed that it is possible, for any sufficiently large set of axioms (Peano&#x27;s axioms, for example) to construct a statement whose truth is independent of that set of axioms. As a corollary, Gödel proved that the consistency of a theory like Peano arithmetic is an unprovable assertion within the scope of that theory.

It is reasonable to believe in the consistency of Peano arithmetic because it is satisfied by the system of natural numbers, an infinite but intuitively accessible formal system. However, at present, there is no known way of demonstrating the consistency of the modern Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms for set theory. Furthermore, using techniques of forcing (Cohen) one can show that the continuum hypothesis (Cantor) is independent of the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms. Thus, even this very general set of axioms cannot be regarded as the definitive foundation for mathematics.

===Other sciences===
Experimental sciences - as opposed to mathematics and logic - also have general founding assertions from which a deductive reasoning can be built so as to express propositions that predict properties - either still general or much more specialized to a specific experimental context. For instance, Newton&#x27;s laws in classical mechanics, Maxwell&#x27;s equations in classical electromagnetism, Einstein&#x27;s equation in general relativity, Mendel&#x27;s laws of genetics, Darwin&#x27;s Natural selection law, etc. These founding assertions are usually called &quot;principles&quot; or &quot;postulates&quot; so as to distinguish from mathematical &quot;axioms&quot;.

As a matter of facts, the role of axioms in mathematics and postulates in experimental sciences is different. In mathematics one neither &quot;proves&quot; nor &quot;disproves&quot; an axiom. A set of mathematical axioms gives a set of rules that fix a conceptual realm, in which the theorems logically follow. In contrast, in experimental sciences, a set of postulates shall allow deducing results that match or do not match experimental results. If postulates do not allow deducing experimental predictions, they do not set a scientific conceptual framework and have to be completed or made more accurate. If the postulates allow deducing predictions of experimental results, the comparison with experiments allows falsifying (falsified) the theory that the postulates install. A theory is considered valid as long as it has not been falsified.

Now, the transition between the mathematical axioms and scientific postulates is always slightly blurred, especially in physics. This is due to the heavy use of mathematical tools to support the physical theories. For instance, the introduction of Newton&#x27;s laws rarely establishes as a prerequisite neither Euclidean geometry or differential calculus that they imply. It became more apparent when Albert Einstein first introduced special relativity where the invariant quantity is no more the Euclidean length formula_1 (defined as formula_2) &gt; but the Minkowski spacetime interval formula_3 (defined as formula_4), and then general relativity where flat Minkowskian geometry is replaced with pseudo-Riemannian geometry on curved manifolds.

In quantum physics, two sets of postulates have coexisted for some time, which provide a very nice example of falsification. The &#x27;Copenhagen school&#x27; (Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, Max Born) developed an operational approach with a complete mathematical formalism that involves the description of quantum system by vectors (&#x27;states&#x27;) in a separable Hilbert space, and physical quantities as linear operators that act in this Hilbert space. This approach is fully falsifiable and has so far produced the most accurate predictions in physics. But it has the unsatisfactory aspect of not allowing answers to questions one would naturally ask. For this reason, another &#x27;hidden variables&#x27; approach was developed for some time by Albert Einstein, Erwin Schrödinger, David Bohm. It was created so as to try to give deterministic explanation to phenomena such as entanglement. This approach assumed that the Copenhagen school description was not complete, and postulated that some yet unknown variable was to be added to the theory so as to allow answering some of the questions it does not answer (the founding elements of which were discussed as the EPR paradox in 1935). Taking this idea seriously, John Bell derived in 1964 a prediction that would lead to different experimental results (Bell&#x27;s inequalities) in the Copenhagen and the Hidden variable case. The experiment was conducted first by Alain Aspect in the early 1980s, and the result excluded the simple hidden variable approach (sophisticated hidden variables could still exist but their properties would still be more disturbing than the problems they try to solve). This does not mean that the conceptual framework of quantum physics can be considered as complete now, since some open questions still exist (the limit between the quantum and classical realms, what happens during a quantum measurement, what happens in a completely closed quantum system such as the universe itself, etc.).

==Mathematical logic==
In the field of mathematical logic, a clear distinction is made between two notions of axioms: &quot;logical&quot; and &quot;non-logical&quot; (somewhat similar to the ancient distinction between &quot;axioms&quot; and &quot;postulates&quot; respectively).

===Logical axioms===
These are certain formulas in a formal language that are universally valid, that is, formulas that are satisfied by every assignment of values. Usually one takes as logical axioms &quot;at least&quot; some minimal set of tautologies that is sufficient for proving all tautologies in the language; in the case of predicate logic more logical axioms than that are required, in order to prove logical truths that are not tautologies in the strict sense.

====Examples====

=====Propositional logic=====
In propositional logic, it is common to take as logical axioms all formulae of the following forms, where formula_5, formula_6, and formula_7 can be any formulae of the language and where the included primitive connectives are only &quot;formula_8&quot; for negation of the immediately following proposition and &quot;formula_9&quot; for implication from antecedent to consequent propositions:

# formula_10
# formula_11
# formula_12

Each of these patterns is an &quot;axiom schema&quot;, a rule for generating an infinite number of axioms. For example, if formula_13, formula_14, and formula_15 are propositional variables, then formula_16 and formula_17 are both instances of axiom schema 1, and hence are axioms. It can be shown that with only these three axiom schemata and &quot;modus ponens&quot;, one can prove all tautologies of the propositional calculus. It can also be shown that no pair of these schemata is sufficient for proving all tautologies with &quot;modus ponens&quot;.

Other axiom schemata involving the same or different sets of primitive connectives can be alternatively constructed.

These axiom schemata are also used in the predicate calculus, but additional logical axioms are needed to include a quantifier in the calculus.

=====First-order logic=====

Axiom of Equality.&lt;br&gt;Let formula_18 be a first-order language. For each variable formula_19, the below formula is universally valid.
formula_20

This means that, for any variable symbol formula_19, the formula formula_20 can be regarded as an axiom. Additionally, in this example, for this not to fall into vagueness and a never-ending series of &quot;primitive notions&quot;, either a precise notion of what we mean by formula_20 (or, for that matter, &quot;to be equal&quot;) has to be well established first, or a purely formal and syntactical usage of the symbol formula_24 has to be enforced, only regarding it as a string and only a string of symbols, and mathematical logic does indeed do that.

Another, more interesting example axiom scheme, is that which provides us with what is known as Universal Instantiation:
Axiom scheme for Universal Instantiation.&lt;br&gt;Given a formula formula_5 in a first-order language formula_18, a variable formula_19 and a term formula_28 that is substitutable for formula_19 in formula_5, the below formula is universally valid.
formula_31

Where the symbol formula_32 stands for the formula formula_5 with the term formula_28 substituted for formula_19. (See Substitution of variables.) In informal terms, this example allows us to state that, if we know that a certain property formula_36 holds for every formula_19 and that formula_28 stands for a particular object in our structure, then we should be able to claim formula_39. Again, &quot;we are claiming that the formula&quot; formula_40 &quot;is valid&quot;, that is, we must be able to give a &quot;proof&quot; of this fact, or more properly speaking, a &quot;metaproof&quot;. These examples are &quot;metatheorems&quot; of our theory of mathematical logic since we are dealing with the very concept of &quot;proof&quot; itself. Aside from this, we can also have Existential Generalization:
Axiom scheme for Existential Generalization. Given a formula formula_5 in a first-order language formula_18, a variable formula_19 and a term formula_28 that is substitutable for formula_19 in formula_5, the below formula is universally valid.
formula_47

===Non-logical axioms===
Non-logical axioms are formulas that play the role of theory-specific assumptions. Reasoning about two different structures, for example, the natural numbers and the integers, may involve the same logical axioms; the non-logical axioms aim to capture what is special about a particular structure (or set of structures, such as groups). Thus non-logical axioms, unlike logical axioms, are not &quot;tautologies&quot;. Another name for a non-logical axiom is &quot;postulate&quot;.

Almost every modern mathematical theory starts from a given set of non-logical axioms, and it was thought that, in principle, every theory could be axiomatized in this way and formalized down to the bare language of logical formulas.

Non-logical axioms are often simply referred to as &quot;axioms&quot; in mathematical discourse. This does not mean that it is claimed that they are true in some absolute sense. For instance, in some groups, the group operation is commutative, and this can be asserted with the introduction of an additional axiom, but without this axiom, we can do quite well developing (the more general) group theory, and we can even take its negation as an axiom for the study of non-commutative groups.

====Examples====
This section gives examples of mathematical theories that are developed entirely from a set of non-logical axioms (axioms, henceforth). A rigorous treatment of any of these topics begins with a specification of these axioms.

Basic theories, such as arithmetic, real analysis and complex analysis are often introduced non-axiomatically, but implicitly or explicitly there is generally an assumption that the axioms being used are the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with choice, abbreviated ZFC, or some very similar system of axiomatic set theory like Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory, a conservative extension of ZFC. Sometimes slightly stronger theories such as Morse–Kelley set theory or set theory with a strongly inaccessible cardinal allowing the use of a Grothendieck universe is used, but in fact, most mathematicians can actually prove all they need in systems weaker than ZFC, such as second-order arithmetic.

The study of topology in mathematics extends all over through point set topology, algebraic topology, differential topology, and all the related paraphernalia, such as homology theory, homotopy theory. The development of &quot;abstract algebra&quot; brought with itself group theory, rings, fields, and Galois theory.

This list could be expanded to include most fields of mathematics, including measure theory, ergodic theory, probability, representation theory, and differential geometry.

=====Arithmetic=====
The Peano axioms are the most widely used &quot;axiomatization&quot; of first-order arithmetic. They are a set of axioms strong enough to prove many important facts about number theory and they allowed Gödel to establish his famous second incompleteness theorem.

We have a language formula_48 where formula_49 is a constant symbol and formula_50 is a unary function and the following axioms:

# formula_51
# formula_52
# formula_53 for any formula_54 formula formula_5 with one free variable.

The standard structure is formula_56 where formula_57 is the set of natural numbers, formula_50 is the successor function and formula_49 is naturally interpreted as the number 0.

=====Euclidean geometry=====
Probably the oldest, and most famous, list of axioms are the 4 + 1 Euclid&#x27;s postulates of plane geometry. The axioms are referred to as &quot;4 + 1&quot; because for nearly two millennia the fifth (parallel) postulate (&quot;through a point outside a line there is exactly one parallel&quot;) was suspected of being derivable from the first four. Ultimately, the fifth postulate was found to be independent of the first four. One can assume that exactly one parallel through a point outside a line exists, or that infinitely many exist. This choice gives us two alternative forms of geometry in which the interior angles of a triangle add up to exactly 180 degrees or less, respectively, and are known as Euclidean and hyperbolic geometries. If one also removes the second postulate (&quot;a line can be extended indefinitely&quot;) then elliptic geometry arises, where there is no parallel through a point outside a line, and in which the interior angles of a triangle add up to more than 180 degrees.

=====Real analysis=====
The objectives of the study are within the domain of real numbers. The real numbers are uniquely picked out (up to isomorphism) by the properties of a &quot;Dedekind complete ordered field&quot;, meaning that any nonempty set of real numbers with an upper bound has a least upper bound. However, expressing these properties as axioms requires the use of second-order logic. The Löwenheim–Skolem theorems tell us that if we restrict ourselves to first-order logic, any axiom system for the reals admits other models, including both models that are smaller than the reals and models that are larger. Some of the latter are studied in non-standard analysis.

===Role in mathematical logic===

====Deductive systems and completeness====
A deductive system consists of a set formula_60 of logical axioms, a set formula_61 of non-logical axioms, and a set formula_62 of &quot;rules of inference&quot;. A desirable property of a deductive system is that it be complete. A system is said to be complete if, for all formulas formula_5,

formula_64
that is, for any statement that is a &quot;logical consequence&quot; of formula_61 there actually exists a &quot;deduction&quot; of the statement from formula_61. This is sometimes expressed as &quot;everything that is true is provable&quot;, but it must be understood that &quot;true&quot; here means &quot;made true by the set of axioms&quot;, and not, for example, &quot;true in the intended interpretation&quot;. Gödel&#x27;s completeness theorem establishes the completeness of a certain commonly used type of deductive system.

Note that &quot;completeness&quot; has a different meaning here than it does in the context of Gödel&#x27;s first incompleteness theorem, which states that no &quot;recursive&quot;, &quot;consistent&quot; set of non-logical axioms formula_61 of the Theory of Arithmetic is &quot;complete&quot;, in the sense that there will always exist an arithmetic statement formula_5 such that neither formula_5 nor formula_70 can be proved from the given set of axioms.

There is thus, on the one hand, the notion of &quot;completeness of a deductive system&quot; and on the other hand that of &quot;completeness of a set of non-logical axioms&quot;. The completeness theorem and the incompleteness theorem, despite their names, do not contradict one another.

===Further discussion===
Early mathematicians regarded axiomatic geometry as a model of physical space, implying, there could ultimately only be one such model. The idea that alternative mathematical systems might exist was very troubling to mathematicians of the 19th century and the developers of systems such as Boolean algebra made elaborate efforts to derive them from traditional arithmetic. Galois showed just before his untimely death that these efforts were largely wasted. Ultimately, the abstract parallels between algebraic systems were seen to be more important than the details, and modern algebra was born. In the modern view, axioms may be any set of formulas, as long as they are not known to be inconsistent.

<text>Alpha (uppercase , lowercase ) is the first letter of the Greek alphabet. In the system of Greek numerals, it has a value of one. Alpha is derived from the Phoenician letter aleph , which is the West Semitic word for &quot;ox&quot;. Letters that arose from alpha include the Latin letter A and the Cyrillic letter А.

==Uses==

===Greek===
In Ancient Greek, alpha was pronounced and could be either phonemically long ([aː]) or short ([a]). Where there is ambiguity, long and short alpha are sometimes written with a macron and breve today: .
* = &quot;&quot; &quot;a time&quot;
* = &quot;&quot; &quot;tongue&quot;

In Modern Greek, vowel length has been lost, and all instances of alpha simply represent the open front unrounded vowel .

In the polytonic orthography of Greek, alpha, like other vowel letters, can occur with several diacritic marks: any of three accent symbols (), and either of two breathing marks (), as well as combinations of these. It can also combine with the iota subscript ().

====Greek grammar====
In the Attic–Ionic dialect of Ancient Greek, long alpha fronted to (eta). In Ionic, the shift took place in all positions. In Attic, the shift did not take place after epsilon, iota, and rho (; ). In Doric and Aeolic, long alpha is preserved in all positions.
*Doric, Aeolic, Attic &#x27; – Ionic &#x27;, &quot;country&quot;
*Doric, Aeolic &#x27; – Attic, Ionic &#x27;, &quot;report&quot;

Privative a is the Ancient Greek prefix or , added to words to negate them. It originates from the Proto-Indo-European (syllabic nasal) and is cognate with English &quot;un-&quot;.

Copulative a is the Greek prefix or . It comes from Proto-Indo-European .

===Mathematics and science===

The letter alpha represents various concepts in physics and chemistry, including alpha radiation, angular acceleration, alpha particles, alpha carbon and strength of electromagnetic interaction (as fine-structure constant). Alpha also stands for thermal expansion coefficient of a compound in physical chemistry. In ethology, it is used to name the dominant individual in a group of animals. In aerodynamics, the letter is used as a symbol for the angle of attack of an aircraft and the word &quot;alpha&quot; is used as a synonym for this property.

In astronomy, α is often used to designate the brightest star in a constellation.

In mathematics, the letter alpha is used to denote the area underneath a normal curve in statistics to denote significance level when proving null and alternative hypotheses. It is also commonly used in algebraic solutions representing quantities such as angles. In mathematical logic, α is sometimes used as a placeholder for ordinal numbers. It is used for Stoneham numbers.

Most occurrences of alpha in science are the lowercase alpha. The uppercase letter alpha is not generally used as a symbol because it tends to be rendered identically to the uppercase Latin A.

The proportionality operator &quot;∝&quot; (in Unicode: U+221D) is sometimes mistaken for alpha.

===International Phonetic Alphabet===
In the International Phonetic Alphabet, the letter ɑ, which looks similar to the lower-case alpha, represents the open back unrounded vowel.

==History and symbolism==

===Origin===
The Phoenician alphabet was adopted for Greek in the early 8th century BC, perhaps in Euboea. 
The majority of the letters of the Phoenician alphabet were adopted into Greek with much the same sounds as they had had in Phoenician, but &quot;ʼāleph&quot;, the Phoenician letter representing the glottal stop ,
was adopted as representing the vowel ; similarly, &quot;hē&quot; and &quot;ʽayin&quot; are Phoenician consonants that became Greek vowels, epsilon and omicron , respectively.

===Plutarch===
Plutarch, in &quot;Moralia&quot;, presents a discussion on why the letter alpha stands first in the alphabet. Ammonius asks Plutarch what he, being a Boeotian, has to say for Cadmus, the Phoenician who reputedly settled in Thebes and introduced the alphabet to Greece, placing &quot;alpha&quot; first because it is the Phoenician name for ox—which, unlike Hesiod, the Phoenicians considered not the second or third, but the first of all necessities. &quot;Nothing at all,&quot; Plutarch replied. He then added that he would rather be assisted by Lamprias, his own grandfather, than by Dionysus&#x27; grandfather, i.e. Cadmus. For Lamprias had said that the first articulate sound made is &quot;alpha&quot;, because it is very plain and simple—the air coming off the mouth does not require any motion of the tongue—and therefore this is the first sound that children make.

According to Plutarch&#x27;s natural order of attribution of the vowels to the planets, alpha was connected with the Moon.

===Alpha and Omega===

As the first letter of the alphabet, Alpha as a Greek numeral came to represent the number 1.
Therefore, Alpha, both as a symbol and term, is used to refer to the &quot;first&quot;, or &quot;primary&quot;, or &quot;principal&quot; (most significant) occurrence or status of a thing.
The New Testament has God declaring himself to be the &quot;Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.&quot; (Revelation 22:13, KJV, and see also 1:8).

Consequently, the term &quot;alpha&quot; has also come to be used to denote &quot;primary&quot; position in social hierarchy, examples being the concept of dominant &quot;alpha&quot; members in groups of animals.

<doc id="930" wikidata="Q297425" url="?curid=930" title="Alvin Toffler">
<text>Alvin Eugene Toffler (October 4, 1928 – June 27, 2016) was an American writer, futurist, and businessman known for his works discussing modern technologies, including the digital revolution and the communication revolution, with emphasis on their effects on cultures worldwide. He is regarded as one of the world&#x27;s outstanding futurists.

Toffler was an associate editor of &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine. In his early works he focused on technology and its impact, which he termed &quot;information overload&quot;. In 1970, his first major book about the future, &quot;Future Shock&quot;, became a worldwide best-seller and has sold over 6 million copies.

He and his wife Heidi Toffler (1929–2019), who collaborated with him for most of his writings, moved on to examining the reaction to changes in society with another best-selling book, &quot;The Third Wave&quot;, in 1980. In it, he foresaw such technological advances as cloning, personal computers, the Internet, cable television and mobile communication. His later focus, via their other best-seller, &quot;Powershift&quot;, (1990), was on the increasing power of 21st-century military hardware and the proliferation of new technologies.

He founded Toffler Associates, a management consulting company, and was a visiting scholar at the Russell Sage Foundation, visiting professor at Cornell University, faculty member of the New School for Social Research, a White House correspondent, and a business consultant. Toffler&#x27;s ideas and writings were a significant influence on the thinking of business and government leaders worldwide, including China&#x27;s Zhao Ziyang, and AOL founder Steve Case.

==Early life==
Alvin Toffler was born on October 4, 1928, in New York City, and raised in Brooklyn. He was the son of Rose (Albaum) and Sam Toffler, a furrier, both Polish Jews who had migrated to America. He had one younger sister. He was inspired to become a writer at the age of 7 by his aunt and uncle, who lived with the Tofflers. &quot;They were Depression-era literary intellectuals,&quot; Toffler said, &quot;and they always talked about exciting ideas.&quot;

Toffler graduated from New York University in 1950 as an English major, though by his own account he was more focused on political activism than grades. He met his future wife, Adelaide Elizabeth Farrell (nicknamed &quot;Heidi&quot;), when she was starting a graduate course in linguistics. Being radical students, they decided against further graduate work and moved to Cleveland, Ohio, where they married on April 29, 1950.

== Career==
Seeking experiences to write about, Alvin and Heidi Toffler spent the next five years as blue collar workers on assembly lines while studying industrial mass production in their daily work. He compared his own desire for experience to other writers, such as Jack London, who in his quest for subjects to write about sailed the seas, and John Steinbeck, who went to pick grapes with migrant workers. In their first factory jobs, Heidi became a union shop steward in the aluminum foundry where she worked. Alvin became a millwright and welder. In the evenings Alvin would write poetry and fiction, but discovered he was proficient at neither.

His hands-on practical labor experience helped Alvin Toffler land a position at a union-backed newspaper, a transfer to its Washington bureau in 1957, then three years as a White House correspondent, covering Congress and the White House for a Pennsylvania daily newspaper.

They returned to New York City in 1959 when &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine invited Alvin to become its labor columnist, later having him write about business and management. After leaving &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine in 1962, Toffler began a freelance career, writing long form articles for scholarly journals and magazines. His 1964 &quot;Playboy interviews&quot; with Russian novelist Vladimir Nabokov and Ayn Rand were considered among the magazine&#x27;s best. His interview with Rand was the first time the magazine had given such a platform to a female intellectual, which as one commentator said, &quot;the real bird of paradise Toffler captured for Playboy in 1964 was Ayn Rand.&quot;

Toffler was hired by IBM to conduct research and write a paper on the social and organizational impact of computers, leading to his contact with the earliest computer &quot;gurus&quot; and artificial intelligence researchers and proponents. Xerox invited him to write about its research laboratory and AT&amp;T consulted him for strategic advice. This AT&amp;T work led to a study of telecommunications, which advised the company&#x27;s top management to break up the company more than a decade before the government forced AT&amp;T to break up.

In the mid-1960s, the Tofflers began five years of research on what would become &quot;Future Shock&quot;, published in 1970. It has sold over 6 million copies worldwide, according to the &quot;New York Times,&quot; or over 15 million copies according to the Tofflers&#x27; Web site. Toffler coined the term &quot;future shock&quot; to refer to what happens to a society when change happens too fast, which results in social confusion and normal decision-making processes breaking down. The book has never been out of print and has been translated into dozens of languages.

He continued the theme in &quot;The Third Wave&quot; in 1980. While he describes the first and second waves as the agricultural and industrial revolutions, the &quot;third wave,&quot; a phrase he coined, represents the current information, computer-based revolution. He forecast the spread of the Internet and email, interactive media, cable television, cloning, and other digital advancements. He claimed that one of the side effects of the digital age has been &quot;information overload,&quot; another term he coined. In 1990, he wrote &quot;Powershift&quot;, also with the help of his wife, Heidi.

In 1996, with American business consultant Tom Johnson, they co-founded Toffler Associates, an advisory firm designed to implement many of the ideas the Tofflers had written on. The firm worked with businesses, NGOs, and governments in the United States, South Korea, Mexico, Brazil, Singapore, Australia, and other countries. During this period in his career, Toffler lectured worldwide, taught at several schools and met world leaders, such as Mikhail Gorbachev, along with key executives and military officials.

===Ideas and opinions===
Toffler stated many of his ideas during an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in 1998. &quot;Society needs people who take care of the elderly and who know how to be compassionate and honest,&quot; he said. &quot;Society needs people who work in hospitals. Society needs all kinds of skills that are not just cognitive; they&#x27;re emotional, they&#x27;re affectional. You can&#x27;t run the society on data and computers alone.&quot;

His opinions about the future of education, many of which were in &quot;Future Shock&quot;, have often been quoted. An often misattributed quote, however, is that of psychologist Herbert Gerjuoy: &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s illiterate will not be the man who can&#x27;t read; he will be the man who has not learned how to learn.&quot;

Early in his career, after traveling to other countries, he became aware of the new and myriad inputs that visitors received from these other cultures. He explained during an interview that some visitors would become &quot;truly disoriented and upset&quot; by the strange environment, which he described as a reaction to culture shock. From that issue, he foresaw another problem for the future, when a culturally &quot;new environment comes to you ... and comes to you rapidly.&quot; That kind of sudden cultural change within one&#x27;s own country, which he felt many would not understand, would lead to a similar reaction, one of &quot;future shock&quot;, which he wrote about in his book by that title. Toffler writes:
In &quot;The Third Wave&quot;, Toffler describes three types of societies, based on the concept of &quot;waves&quot;—each wave pushes the older societies and cultures aside. He describes the &quot;First Wave&quot; as the society after agrarian revolution and replaced the first hunter-gatherer cultures. The &quot;Second Wave,&quot; he labels society during the Industrial Revolution (ca. late 17th century through the mid-20th century). That period saw the increase of urban industrial populations which had undermined the traditional nuclear family, and initiated a factory-like education system, and the growth of the corporation. Toffler said:

The &quot;Third Wave&quot; was a term he coined to describe the post-industrial society, which began in the late 1950s. His description of this period dovetails with other futurist writers, who also wrote about the Information Age, Space Age, Electronic Era, Global Village, terms which highlighted a scientific-technological revolution. The Tofflers claimed to have predicted a number of geopolitical events, such as the collapse of the Soviet Union, the fall of the Berlin Wall and the future economic growth in the Asia-Pacific region.

==Influences and popular culture==

Toffler often visited with dignitaries in Asia, including China&#x27;s Zhao Ziyang, Singapore&#x27;s Lee Kuan Yew and South Korea&#x27;s Kim Dae Jung, all of whom were influenced by his views as Asia&#x27;s emerging markets increased in global significance during the 1980s and 1990s. Although they had originally censored some of his books and ideas, China&#x27;s government cited him along with Franklin Roosevelt and Bill Gates as being among the Westerners who had most influenced their country. &quot;The Third Wave&quot; along with a video documentary based on it became best-sellers in China and were widely distributed to schools. The video&#x27;s success inspired the marketing of videos on related themes in the late 1990s by Infowars, whose name is derived from the term coined by Toffler in the book. Toffler&#x27;s influence on Asian thinkers was summed up in an article in &quot;Daedalus&quot;, published by the American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences:
U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich publicly lauded his ideas about the future, and urged members of Congress to read Toffler&#x27;s book, &quot;Creating a New Civilization&quot; (1995). Others, such as AOL founder Steve Case, cited Toffler&#x27;s &quot;The Third Wave&quot; as a formative influence on his thinking, which inspired him to write &quot;The Third Wave: An Entrepreneur&#x27;s Vision of the Future&quot; in 2016. Case said that Toffler was a &quot;real pioneer in helping people, companies and even countries lean into the future.&quot;

In 1980, Ted Turner founded CNN, which he said was inspired by Toffler&#x27;s forecasting the end of the dominance of the three main television networks. Turner&#x27;s company, Turner Broadcasting, published Toffler&#x27;s &quot;Creating a New Civilization&quot; in 1995. Shortly after the book was released, the former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev hosted the Global Governance Conference in San Francisco with the theme, &quot;Toward a New Civilization&quot;, which was attended by dozens of world figures, including the Tofflers, George H. W. Bush, Margaret Thatcher, Carl Sagan, Abba Eban and Turner with his then-wife, actress Jane Fonda.

Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim was influenced by his works, and became a friend of the writer. Global marketer J.D. Power also said he was inspired by Toffler&#x27;s works.

Since the 1960s, people had tried to make sense out of the effect of new technologies and social change, a problem which made Toffler&#x27;s writings widely influential beyond the confines of scientific, economic, and public policy. His works and ideas have been subject to various criticisms, usually with the same argumentation used against futurology: that foreseeing the future is nigh impossible.

Techno music pioneer Juan Atkins cites Toffler&#x27;s phrase &quot;techno rebels&quot; in &quot;The Third Wave&quot; as inspiring him to use the word &quot;techno&quot; to describe the musical style he helped to create

Musician Curtis Mayfield released a disco song called &quot;Future Shock,&quot; later covered in an electro version by Herbie Hancock. Science fiction author John Brunner wrote &quot;The Shockwave Rider,&quot; from the concept of &quot;future shock.&quot;

The nightclub Toffler, in Rotterdam, is named after him.

In the song &quot;Victoria&quot; by The Exponents, the protagonist&#x27;s daily routine and cultural interests are described: &quot;She&#x27;s up in time to watch the soap operas, reads Cosmopolitan and Alvin Toffler&quot;.

==Critical assessment ==

Accenture, the management consultancy firm, identified Toffler in 2002 as being among the most influential voices in business leaders, along with Bill Gates and Peter Drucker. Toffler has also been described in a &quot;Financial Times&quot; interview as the &quot;world&#x27;s most famous futurologist&quot;. In 2006, the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; classed him among the 50 foreigners who shaped modern China, which one U.S. newspaper notes made him a &quot;guru of sorts to world statesmen.&quot; Chinese Premier and General Secretary Zhao Ziyang was greatly influenced by Toffler. He convened conferences to discuss &quot;The Third Wave&quot; in the early 1980s, and in 1985 the book was the No. 2 best seller in China.

Author Mark Satin characterizes Toffler as an important early influence on radical centrist political thought.

Newt Gingrich became close to the Tofflers in the 1970s and said &quot;The Third Wave&quot; had immensely influenced his own thinking and was &quot;one of the great seminal works of our time.&quot;

==Selected awards==
Toffler has received several prestigious prizes and awards, including the McKinsey Foundation Book Award for Contributions to Management Literature, Officier de L&#x27;Ordre des Arts et Lettres, and appointments, including Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the International Institute for Strategic Studies.

In 2006, Alvin and Heidi Toffler were recipients of Brown University&#x27;s Independent Award.

==Personal life==
Toffler was married to Heidi Toffler (born Adelaide Elizabeth Farrell), also a writer and futurist. They lived in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles, California, and previously lived in Redding, Connecticut.

The couple&#x27;s only child, Karen Toffler (1954–2000), died at age 46 after more than a decade suffering from Guillain–Barré syndrome.

Alvin Toffler died in his sleep on June 27, 2016, at his home in Los Angeles. No cause of death was given. He is buried at Westwood Memorial Park.

<doc id="931" wikidata="Q944598" url="?curid=931" title="The Amazing Spider-Man">
<text>The Amazing Spider-Man is an ongoing American superhero comic book series featuring the Marvel Comics superhero Spider-Man as its title character and main protagonist. Being in the mainstream continuity of the franchise, it was the character&#x27;s first title, launching seven months after his introduction in the final issue of &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot;. The series began publication with a March 1963 cover date and has been published nearly continuously to date over six volumes with only one significant interruption. Issues of the title currently feature an issue number within its sixth volume, as well as a &quot;legacy&quot; number reflecting the issue&#x27;s overall number across all &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; volumes. The title reached 900 issues in 2022.

The series began as a bimonthly periodical before being increased to monthly after four issues. It was the character&#x27;s sole monthly headlining title until &quot;Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man&quot; would launch in 1976. After 441 issues, &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; was restarted in 1999 as issue No. 1 of Volume 2. It ran for 58 issues before reverting to the title&#x27;s overall issue number with #500 in 2003. The series ran essentially continuously over the first two volumes from 1963 until its landmark 700th issue at the end of 2012 when it was replaced by &quot;The Superior Spider-Man&quot; as part of the Marvel NOW! relaunch of Marvel&#x27;s comic lines. The title was occasionally published biweekly during the first two volumes, and was published three times a month from 2008 to 2010. After the relaunch of &quot;Action Comics&quot; and &quot;Detective Comics&quot;, &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; briefly became the highest-numbered active American comic book.

&quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; returned with volume 3 in April 2014 following the conclusion of &quot;The Superior Spider-Man&quot; story arc after 31 issues. In late 2015, the series was relaunched with a fourth volume following the 2015 &quot;Secret Wars&quot; event. After 45 years, the volume was once again relaunched as part of &quot;Marvel Legacy&quot;, returning to the overall &quot;legacy&quot; numbering with issue No. 789 in late 2017. Less than a year later, the series was relaunched again with a fifth volume as part of Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Fresh Start&quot;. For the first time, although the issue numbers were again restarted from #1, the issues also bore the overall &quot;legacy&quot; issue number. A sixth volume commenced in April 2022 to celebrate Spider-Man&#x27;s 60th anniversary. Since the second volume, the title has had various release schedules, including monthly and bi-weekly, among others.

==Publication history==
Writer-editor Stan Lee and artist/co-plotter Steve Ditko created the character of Spider-Man, and the pair produced 38 issues from March 1963 to July 1966. Ditko left after the 38th issue, while Lee remained as writer until issue 100. Since then, many writers and artists have taken over the monthly comic through the years, chronicling the adventures of Marvel&#x27;s most identifiable hero.

&quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; has been the character&#x27;s flagship series for his first fifty years in publication, and was the only monthly series to star Spider-Man until &quot;Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot;, in 1976, although 1972 saw the debut of &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot;, with the vast majority of issues featuring Spider-Man along with a rotating cast of other Marvel characters. Most of the major characters and villains of the Spider-Man saga have been introduced in &quot;Amazing&quot;, and with few exceptions, it is where most key events in the character&#x27;s history have occurred. The title was published continuously until No. 441 (Nov. 1998) when Marvel Comics relaunched it as vol. 2 No. 1 (Jan. 1999), but on Spider-Man&#x27;s 40th anniversary, this new title reverted to using the numbering of the original series, beginning again with issue No. 500 (Dec. 2003) and lasting until the final issue, No. 700 (Feb. 2013).
===1960s===
Due to strong sales on the character&#x27;s first appearance in &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot; No. 15, Spider-Man was given his own ongoing series in March 1963. The initial years of the series, under Lee and Ditko, chronicled Spider-Man&#x27;s nascent career as a masked super-human vigilante with his civilian life as hard-luck yet perpetually good-humored and well-meaning teenager Peter Parker. Peter balanced his career as Spider-Man with his job as a freelance photographer for &quot;The Daily Bugle&quot; under the bombastic editor-publisher J. Jonah Jameson to support himself and his frail Aunt May. At the same time, Peter dealt with public hostility towards Spider-Man and the antagonism of his classmates Flash Thompson and Liz Allan at Midtown High School, while embarking on a tentative, ill-fated romance with Jameson&#x27;s secretary, Betty Brant.

By focusing on Parker&#x27;s everyday problems, Lee and Ditko created a groundbreakingly flawed, self-doubting superhero, and the first major teenaged superhero to be a protagonist and not a sidekick. Ditko&#x27;s quirky art provided a stark contrast to the more cleanly dynamic stylings of Marvel&#x27;s most prominent artist, Jack Kirby, and combined with the humor and pathos of Lee&#x27;s writing to lay the foundation for what became an enduring mythos.

Most of Spider-Man&#x27;s key villains and supporting characters were introduced during this time. Issue No. 1 (Mar. 1963) featured the first appearances of J. Jonah Jameson and his astronaut son John Jameson, and the supervillain the Chameleon. It included the hero&#x27;s first encounter with the superhero team the Fantastic Four. Issue No. 2 (May 1963) featured the first appearance of the Vulture and the Tinkerer as well as the beginning of Parker&#x27;s freelance photography career at the newspaper &quot;The Daily Bugle&quot;.

The Lee-Ditko era continued to usher in a significant number of villains and supporting characters, including Doctor Octopus in No. 3 (July 1963); the Sandman and Betty Brant in No. 4 (Sept. 1963); the Lizard in No. 6 (Nov. 1963); Living Brain in No. 8 (Jan. 1964); Electro in No. 9 (Mar. 1964); Mysterio in No. 13 (June 1964); the Green Goblin in No. 14 (July 1964); Kraven The Hunter in No. 15 (Aug. 1964); reporter Ned Leeds in No. 18 (Nov. 1964); and the Scorpion in No. 20 (Jan. 1965). The Molten Man was introduced in No. 28 (Sept. 1965) which also featured Parker&#x27;s graduation from high school. Peter began attending Empire State University in No. 31 (Dec. 1965), which featured the first appearances of friends and classmates Gwen Stacy and Harry Osborn. Harry&#x27;s father, Norman Osborn first appeared in No. 23 (April 1965) as a member of Jameson&#x27;s country club but was not named nor revealed as Harry&#x27;s father until No. 37 (June 1966).

One of the most celebrated issues of the Lee-Ditko run is No. 33 (Feb. 1966), the third part of the story arc &quot;If This Be My Destiny...!&quot;, which features the dramatic scene of Spider-Man, through force of will and thoughts of family, escaping from being pinned by heavy machinery. Comics historian Les Daniels noted that &quot;Steve Ditko squeezes every ounce of anguish out of Spider-Man&#x27;s predicament, complete with visions of the uncle he failed and the aunt he has sworn to save.&quot; Peter David observed that &quot;After his origin, this two-page sequence from &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; No. 33 is perhaps the best-loved sequence from the Stan Lee/Steve Ditko era.&quot; Steve Saffel stated the &quot;full page Ditko image from &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; No. 33 is one of the most powerful ever to appear in the series and influenced writers and artists for many years to come.&quot; and Matthew K. Manning wrote that &quot;Ditko&#x27;s illustrations for the first few pages of this Lee story included what would become one of the most iconic scenes in Spider-Man&#x27;s history.&quot; The story was chosen as No. 15 in the 100 Greatest Marvels of All Time poll of Marvel&#x27;s readers in 2001. Editor Robert Greenberger wrote in his introduction to the story that &quot;These first five pages are a modern-day equivalent to Shakespeare as Parker&#x27;s soliloquy sets the stage for his next action. And with dramatic pacing and storytelling, Ditko delivers one of the great sequences in all comics.&quot;

Although credited only as artist for most of his run, Ditko would eventually plot the stories as well as draw them, leaving Lee to script the dialogue. A rift between Ditko and Lee developed, and the two men were not on speaking terms long before Ditko completed his last issue, &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; No. 38 (July 1966). The exact reasons for the Ditko-Lee split have never been fully explained. Spider-Man successor artist John Romita Sr., in a 2010 deposition, recalled that Lee and Ditko &quot;ended up not being able to work together because they disagreed on almost everything, cultural, social, historically, everything, they disagreed on characters...&quot;

In successor penciler Romita Sr.&#x27;s first issue, No. 39 (Aug. 1966), nemesis the Green Goblin discovers Spider-Man&#x27;s secret identity and reveals his own to the captive hero. Romita&#x27;s Spider-Man – more polished and heroic-looking than Ditko&#x27;s – became the model for two decades. The Lee-Romita era saw the introduction of such characters as &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; managing editor Robbie Robertson in No. 52 (Sept. 1967) and NYPD Captain George Stacy, father of Parker&#x27;s girlfriend Gwen Stacy, in No. 56 (Jan. 1968). The most important supporting character to be introduced during the Romita era was Mary Jane Watson, who made her first full appearance in No. 42 (Nov. 1966), although she first appeared in No. 25 (June 1965) with her face obscured and had been mentioned since No. 15 (Aug. 1964). Peter David wrote in 2010 that Romita &quot;made the definitive statement of his arrival by pulling Mary Jane out from behind the oversized potted plant [that blocked the reader&#x27;s view of her face in issue no. 25] and placing her on panel in what would instantly become an iconic moment.&quot; Romita has stated that in designing Mary Jane, he &quot;used Ann-Margret from the movie &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot; as a guide, using her coloring, the shape of her face, her red hair and her form-fitting short skirts.&quot;

Lee and Romita toned down the prevalent sense of antagonism in Parker&#x27;s world by improving Parker&#x27;s relationship with the supporting characters and having stories focused as much on the social and college lives of the characters as they did on Spider-Man&#x27;s adventures. The stories became more topical, addressing issues such as civil rights, racism, prisoners&#x27; rights, the Vietnam War, and political elections.

Issue No. 50 (June 1967) introduced the highly enduring criminal mastermind the Kingpin, who would become a major force as well in the superhero series &quot;Daredevil&quot;. Other notable first appearances in the Lee-Romita era include the Rhino in No. 41 (Oct. 1966), the Shocker in No. 46 (Mar. 1967), the Prowler in No. 78 (Nov. 1969), and the Kingpin&#x27;s son, Richard Fisk, in No. 83 (Apr. 1970).

===1970s===

Several spin-off series debuted in the 1970s: &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; in 1972, and &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot; in 1976. A short-lived series titled &quot;Giant-Size Spider-Man&quot; began in July 1974 and ran six issues through 1975. &quot;Spidey Super Stories&quot;, a series aimed at children ages 6–10, ran for 57 issues from October 1974 through 1982.
The flagship title&#x27;s second decade took a grim turn with a story in #89-90 (Oct.-Nov. 1970) featuring the death of Captain George Stacy. This was the first Spider-Man story to be penciled by Gil Kane, who would alternate drawing duties with Romita for the next year-and-a-half and would draw several landmark issues.

One such story took place in the controversial issues #96–98 (May–July 1971). Writer-editor Lee defied the Comics Code Authority with this story, in which Parker&#x27;s friend Harry Osborn, was hospitalized after over-dosing on pills. Lee wrote this story upon a request from the U. S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare for a story about the dangers of drugs. Citing its dictum against depicting drug use, even in an anti-drug context, the CCA refused to put its seal on these issues. With the approval of Marvel publisher Martin Goodman, Lee had the comics published without the seal. The comics sold well and Marvel won praise for its socially conscious efforts. The CCA subsequently loosened the Code to permit negative depictions of drugs, among other new freedoms.

&quot;The Six Arms Saga&quot; of #100–102 (Sept.–Nov. 1971) introduced Morbius, the Living Vampire. The second installment was the first &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; story not written by co-creator Lee, with Roy Thomas taking over writing the book for several months before Lee returned to write #105–110 (Feb.-July 1972). Lee, who was going on to become Marvel Comics&#x27; publisher, with Thomas becoming editor-in-chief, then turned writing duties over to 19-year-old Gerry Conway, who scripted the series through 1975. Romita penciled Conway&#x27;s first half-dozen issues, which introduced the gangster Hammerhead in No. 113 (Oct. 1972). Kane then succeeded Romita as penciler, although Romita would continue inking Kane for a time.

Issue 121 (June 1973 by Conway-Kane-Romita) featured the death of Gwen Stacy at the hands of the Green Goblin in &quot;The Night Gwen Stacy Died.&quot; Her demise and the Goblin&#x27;s apparent death one issue later formed a story arc widely considered as the most defining in the history of Spider-Man. The aftermath of the story deepened both the characterization of Mary Jane Watson and her relationship with Parker.

In 1973 Gil Kane was succeeded by Ross Andru, whose run lasted from issue #125 (Oct. 1973) to #185 (Oct. 1978). Issue#129 (Feb. 1974) introduced the Punisher, who would become one of Marvel Comics&#x27; most popular characters. The Conway-Andru era featured the first appearances of the Man-Wolf in #124–125 (Sept.-Oct. 1973); the near-marriage of Doctor Octopus and Aunt May in #131 (Apr. 1974); Harry Osborn stepping into his father&#x27;s role as the Green Goblin in #135–137 (Aug.-Oct.1974); and the original &quot;Clone Saga&quot;, containing the introduction of Spider-Man&#x27;s clone, in #147–149 (Aug.-Oct. 1975).

Archie Goodwin and Gil Kane produced the title&#x27;s 150th issue (Nov. 1975) before Len Wein became writer with issue No. 151. During Wein&#x27;s tenure, Harry Osborn and Liz Allen dated and became engaged; J. Jonah Jameson was introduced to his eventual second wife, Marla Madison; and Aunt May suffered a heart attack. Wein&#x27;s last story on &quot;Amazing&quot; was a five-issue arc in #176–180 (Jan.-May 1978) featuring a third Green Goblin (Harry Osborn&#x27;s psychiatrist, Bart Hamilton).

Marv Wolfman, Marvel&#x27;s editor-in-chief from 1975 to 1976, succeeded Wein as writer and, in his first issue, #182 (July 1978), had Parker propose marriage to Watson, who refused in the following issue. Keith Pollard succeeded Andru as artist shortly afterward and, with Wolfman, introduced the likable rogue the Black Cat (Felicia Hardy) in #194 (July 1979). As a love interest for Spider-Man, the Black Cat would go on to be an important supporting character for the better part of the next decade and remain a friend and occasional lover into the 2010s.

===1980s===

&quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #200 (Jan. 1980) featured the return and death of the burglar who killed Spider-Man&#x27;s Uncle Ben. Writer Marv Wolfman and penciler Keith Pollard both left the title by mid-year, succeeded by Dennis O&#x27;Neil, a writer known for groundbreaking 1970s work at rival DC Comics, and penciler John Romita Jr. O&#x27;Neil wrote two issues of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man Annual&quot; which were both drawn by Frank Miller. The 1980 &quot;Annual&quot; featured a team-up with Doctor Strange while the 1981 &quot;Annual&quot; showcased a meeting with the Punisher. Roger Stern, who had written nearly 20 issues of sister title &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot;, took over &quot;Amazing&quot; with #224 (Jan. 1982). During his two years on the title, Stern augmented the backgrounds of long-established Spider-Man villains and, with Romita Jr., created the mysterious supervillain the Hobgoblin in #238–239 (Mar.–Apr. 1983). Fans engaged with the mystery of the Hobgoblin&#x27;s secret identity, which continued throughout #244–245 and 249–251 (Sept.-Oct. 1983 and Feb.-April 1984). One lasting change was the reintroduction of Mary Jane Watson as a more serious, mature woman who becomes Peter&#x27;s confidante after she reveals that she knows his secret identity. Stern also wrote &quot;The Kid Who Collects Spider-Man&quot; in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #248 (Jan. 1984), a story which ranks among his most popular.

By mid-1984, Tom DeFalco and Ron Frenz took over scripting and penciling. DeFalco helped establish Parker and Watson&#x27;s mature relationship, laying the foundation for the characters&#x27; wedding in 1987. Notably, in #257 (Oct. 1984), Watson tells Parker that she knows he is Spider-Man, and in #259 (Dec. 1984), she reveals to Parker the extent of her troubled childhood. Other notable issues of the DeFalco-Frenz era include #252 (May 1984), the first appearance of Spider-Man&#x27;s black costume, which the hero would wear almost exclusively for the next four years&#x27; worth of comics; the debut of criminal mastermind the Rose in #253 (June 1984); the revelation in #258 (Nov. 1984) that the black costume is a living being, a symbiote; and the introduction of the female mercenary Silver Sable in #265 (June 1985).

DeFalco and Frenz were both removed from &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; in 1986 by editor Jim Owsley under acrimonious circumstances. A succession of artists including Alan Kupperberg, John Romita Jr., and Alex Saviuk penciled the series from 1987 to 1988, and Owsley wrote the book for the first half of 1987, scripting the five-part &quot;Gang War&quot; story (#284–288) that DeFalco plotted. Former &quot;Spectacular Spider-Man&quot; writer Peter David scripted #289 (June 1987), which revealed Ned Leeds as being the Hobgoblin although this was retconned in 1996 by Roger Stern into Leeds not being the original Hobgoblin after all.

David Michelinie took over as writer in the next issue, for a story arc in #290–292 (July–Sept. 1987) that led to the marriage of Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson in &quot;Amazing Spider-Man Annual&quot; No. 21. The &quot;Kraven&#x27;s Last Hunt&quot; storyline by writer J.M. DeMatteis and artists Mike Zeck and Bob McLeod crossed over into &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #293 and 294. Issue No.298 (Mar. 1988) was the first Spider-Man comic to be drawn by future industry star Todd McFarlane, the first regular artist on &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; since Frenz&#x27;s departure. McFarlane revolutionized Spider-Man&#x27;s look. His depiction – &quot;Ditko-esque&quot; poses, large eyes; wiry, contorted limbs; and messy, knotted, convoluted webbing – influenced the way virtually all subsequent artists would draw the character. McFarlane&#x27;s other significant contribution to the Spider-Man canon was the design for what would become one of Spider-Man&#x27;s most wildly popular antagonists, the supervillain Venom. Issue No. 299 (Apr. 1988) featured Venom&#x27;s first appearance (a last-page cameo) before his first full appearance in #300 (May 1988). The latter issue featured Spider-Man reverting to his original red-and-blue costume.

Other notable issues of the Michelinie-McFarlane era include #312 (Feb. 1989), featuring the Green Goblin vs. the Hobgoblin; and #315–317 (May–July 1989), with the return of Venom. In July 2012, Todd McFarlane&#x27;s original cover art for &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; No. 328 sold for a bid of $657,250, making it the most expensive American comic book art ever sold at auction.

===1990s===
With a civilian life as a married man, the Spider-Man of the 1990s was different from the superhero of the previous three decades. McFarlane left the title in 1990 to write and draw a new series titled simply &quot;Spider-Man&quot;. His successor, Erik Larsen, penciled the book from early 1990 to mid-1991. After issue No. 350, Larsen was succeeded by Mark Bagley, who had won the 1986 Marvel Tryout Contest and was assigned a number of low-profile penciling jobs followed by a run on &quot;New Warriors&quot; in 1990. Bagley penciled the flagship Spider-Man title from 1991 to 1996. During that time, Bagley&#x27;s rendition of Spider-Man was used extensively for licensed material and merchandise.

Issues #361–363 (April–June 1992) introduced Carnage, a second symbiote nemesis for Spider-Man. The series&#x27; 30th-anniversary issue, No. 365 (Aug. 1992), was a double-sized, hologram-cover issue with the cliffhanger ending of Peter Parker&#x27;s parents, long thought dead, reappearing alive. It would be close to two years before they were revealed to be impostors, who are killed in No. 388 (April 1994), scripter Michelinie&#x27;s last issue. His 1987–1994 stint gave him the second-longest run as writer on the title, behind Stan Lee.

Issue No. 375 was released with a gold foil cover. There was an error affecting some issues, which caused them to be missing the majority of the foil.

With No. 389, writer J. M. DeMatteis, whose Spider-Man credits included the 1987 &quot;Kraven&#x27;s Last Hunt&quot; story arc and a 1991–1993 run on &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot;, took over the title. From October 1994 to June 1996, &quot;Amazing&quot; stopped running stories exclusive to it, and ran installments of multi-part stories that crossed over into all the Spider-Man books. One of the few self-contained stories during this period was in No. 400 (April 1995), which featured the death of Aunt May – later revealed to have been faked (although the death still stands in the MC2 continuity). The &quot;Clone Saga&quot; culminated with the revelation that the Spider-Man who had appeared in the previous 20 years of comics was a clone of the real Spider-Man. This plot twist was massively unpopular with many readers, and was later reversed in the &quot;Revelations&quot; story arc that crossed over the Spider-Man books in late 1996.

The Clone Saga tied into a publishing gap after No. 406 (Oct. 1995), when the title was temporarily replaced by &quot;The Amazing Scarlet Spider&quot; #1–2 (Nov.-Dec. 1995), featuring Ben Reilly. The series picked up again with No. 407 (Jan. 1996), with Tom DeFalco returning as writer. Bagley completed his 5½-year run by September 1996. A succession of artists, including Ron Garney, Steve Skroce, Joe Bennett, Rafael Kayanan and John Byrne penciled the book until the final issue, No. 441 (Nov. 1998), after which Marvel rebooted the title with vol. 2, No. 1 (Jan. 1999).

===Relaunch and the 2000s===
Marvel began &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; relaunching the &#x27;Amazing&#x27; comic book series with (vol. 2) #1 (Jan. 1999). Howard Mackie wrote the first 29 issues. The relaunch included the Sandman being regressed to his criminal ways and the &quot;death&quot; of Mary Jane, which was ultimately reversed. Other elements included the introduction of a new Spider-Woman (who was spun off into her own short-lived series) and references to John Byrne&#x27;s miniseries &quot;Spider-Man: Chapter One&quot;, which was launched at the same time as the reboot. Byrne also penciled issues #1–18 (from 1999 to 2000) and wrote #13–14, John Romita Jr. took his place soon after in October 2000. Mackie&#x27;s run ended with &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man Annual 2001&quot;, which saw the return of Mary Jane, who then left Parker upon reuniting with him.

With issue No. 30 (June 2001), J. Michael Straczynski took over as writer and oversaw additional storylines – most notably his lengthy &quot;Spider-Totem&quot; arc, which raised the issue of whether Spider-Man&#x27;s powers were magic-based, rather than as the result of a radioactive spider&#x27;s bite. Additionally, Straczynski resurrected the plot point of Aunt May discovering her nephew was Spider-Man, and returned Mary Jane, with the couple reuniting in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; (vol. 2) #50. Straczynski gave Spider-Man a new profession, having Parker teach at his former high school.

Issue No. 30 began a dual numbering system, with the original series numbering (#471) returned and placed alongside the volume two number on the cover. Other longtime, rebooted Marvel Comics titles, including &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, likewise were given the dual numbering around this time. After (vol. 2) #58 (Nov. 2003), the title reverted completely to its original numbering for issue No. 500 (Dec. 2003). Mike Deodato Jr. penciled the series from mid-2004 until 2006.

That year Peter Parker revealed his Spider-Man identity on live television in the company-crossover storyline &quot;Civil War&quot;, in which the superhero community is split over whether to conform to the federal government&#x27;s new Superhuman Registration Act. This knowledge was erased from the world with the event of the four-part, crossover story arc, &quot;One More Day&quot;, written partially by J. Michael Straczynski and illustrated by Joe Quesada, running through &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #544–545 (Nov.-Dec. 2007), &quot;Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man&quot; No. 24 (Nov. 2007) and &quot;The Sensational Spider-Man&quot; No. 41 (Dec. 2007), the final issues of those two titles. Here, the demon Mephisto makes a Faustian bargain with Parker and Mary Jane, offering to save Parker&#x27;s dying Aunt May if the couple will allow their marriage to have never existed, rewriting that portion of their pasts. This story arc marked the end of Straczynski&#x27;s work on the title.

Following this, Marvel made &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; the company&#x27;s sole Spider-Man title, increasing its frequency of publication to three issues monthly, and inaugurating the series with a sequence of &quot;back to basics&quot; story arcs under the banner of &quot;Brand New Day&quot;. Parker now exists in a changed world where he and Mary Jane had never married, and Parker has no memory of being married to her, with domino effect differences in their immediate world. The most notable of these revisions to Spider-Man continuity are the return of Harry Osborn, whose death in &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot; No. 200 (May 1993) is erased; and the reestablishment of Spider-Man&#x27;s secret identity, with no one except Mary Jane able to recall that Parker is Spider-Man (although he soon reveals his secret identity to the New Avengers and the Fantastic Four). Under the banner of &quot;Brand New Day&quot;, Marvel tried to only use newly created villains instead of relying on older ones. Characters like Mister Negative and Overdrive both in Free Comic Book Day 2007 Spider-Man (July 2007), Menace in No. 549 (March 2008), Ana and Sasha Kravinoff in No. 565 (September 2008) and No. 567 (October 2008) respectively, and several more were introduced. The alternating regular writers were initially Dan Slott, Bob Gale, Marc Guggenheim, and Zeb Wells, joined by a rotation of artists that included Steve McNiven, Salvador Larroca, Phil Jimenez, Barry Kitson, Chris Bachalo, Mike McKone, Marcos Martín, and John Romita Jr. Joe Kelly, Mark Waid, Fred Van Lente and Roger Stern later joined the writing team and Paolo Rivera, Lee Weeks and Marco Checchetto the artist roster. Waid&#x27;s work on the series included a meeting between Spider-Man and Stephen Colbert in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; No. 573 (Dec. 2008).
Issue No. 583 (March 2009) included a back-up story in which Spider-Man meets President Barack Obama.

===2010s and temporary end of publication===
Mark Waid scripted the opening of &quot;The Gauntlet&quot; storyline in issue No. 612 (Jan. 2010). The &quot;Gauntlet&quot; story was concluded by &quot;Grim Hunt&quot; (No. 634–637) which saw the resurrection of long-dead Spider-Man villain, Kraven the Hunter. The series became a twice-monthly title with Dan Slott as sole writer at issue No. 648 (Jan. 2011), launching the &quot;Big Time&quot; storyline. Eight additional pages were added per issue. &quot;Big Time&quot; saw major changes in Spider-Man/Peter Parker&#x27;s life, Peter would start working at Horizon Labs and begin a relationship with Carlie Cooper (his first serious relationship since his marriage to Mary Jane), Mac Gargan returned as Scorpion after spending the past few years as Venom, Phil Urich would take up the mantle of Hobgoblin, and the death of J. Jonah Jameson&#x27;s wife, Marla Jameson. Issues 654 and 654.1 saw the birth of Agent Venom, Flash Thompson bonded with the Venom symbiote, which would lead to Venom getting his own series &quot;Venom (volume 2)&quot;. Starting in No. 659 and going to No. 665, the series built-up to the &quot;Spider-Island&quot; event which officially started in No. 666 and ended in No. 673. &quot;Ends of the Earth&quot; was the next event that ran from No. 682 through No. 687. This publishing format lasted until issue No. 700, which concluded the &quot;Dying Wish&quot; storyline, in which Parker and Doctor Octopus swapped bodies, and the latter taking on the mantle of Spider-Man when Parker apparently died in Doctor Octopus&#x27; body. &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; ended with this issue, with the story continuing in the new series &quot;The Superior Spider-Man&quot;. Despite &quot;The Superior Spider-Man&quot; being considered a different series to &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, the first 33 issue run goes towards the legacy numbering of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; acting as issues 701–733. In December 2013, the series returned for five issues, numbered 700.1 through 700.5, with the first two written by David Morrell and drawn by Klaus Janson.

===2014 relaunch===
In January 2014, Marvel confirmed that &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; would be relaunched on April 30, 2014, starting from issue No. 1, with Peter Parker as Spider-Man once again.
The first issue of this new version of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; was, according to Diamond Comics Distributors, the &quot;best-selling comic book... in over a decade.&quot;
Issues #1–6 were a story arc called &quot;Lucky to be Alive&quot;, taking place immediately after &quot;Goblin Nation&quot;, with issues No. 4 and No. 5 being a crossover with the &quot;Original Sin&quot; storyline. Issue No. 4 introduced Silk, a new heroine who was bitten by the same spider as Peter Parker. Issues #7–8 featured a team-up between Ms. Marvel and Spider-Man, and had backup stories that tied into &quot;Edge of Spider-Verse&quot;. The next major plot arc, titled &quot;Spider-Verse&quot;, began in Issue No. 9 and ended in No. 15, features every Spider-Man from across the dimensions being hunted by Morlun, and a team-up to stop him, with Peter Parker of Earth-616 in command of the Spider-Men&#x27;s Alliance. &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man Annual&quot; No. 1 of the relaunched series was released in December 2014, featuring stories unrelated to &quot;Spider-Verse&quot;.

===The Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows===
In 2015, Marvel started the universe wide Secret Wars event where the core and several other Marvel universes were combined into one big planet called Battleworld. Battleworld was divided into sections with most of them being self-contained universes. Marvel announced that several of these self-contained universes would get their own tie in series and one of them was &quot;Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows&quot;, an alternate universe where Peter Parker and Mary Jane are still married and give birth to their child Annie May Parker, written by Dan Slott. Despite the series being considered separate from the main &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; series, the original 5 issue run is counted towards its legacy numbering acting as No. 752-756.

===2015 relaunch===
Following the 2015 &quot;Secret Wars&quot; event, a number of Spider-Man-related titles were either relaunched or created as part of the &quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel&quot; event. Among them, &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; was relaunched as well and primarily focused on Peter Parker continuing to run Parker Industries and becoming a successful businessman operating worldwide. It also tied with &quot;Civil War II&quot; (involving an Inhuman named Ulysses Cain who can predict possible futures), &quot;Dead No More&quot; (where Ben Reilly [the original Scarlet Spider] revealed to be revived and as one of the antagonists instead), and &quot;Secret Empire&quot; (during Hydra&#x27;s reign led by a Hydra influenced Captain America/Steve Rogers, and the dismissal of Parker Industries by Peter Parker to stop Otto Octavius). Starting in September 2017, Marvel started the Marvel Legacy event which renumbered several Marvel series to their original numbering. The &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; was put back to its original numbering for #789. Issues #789 through 791 focused on the aftermath of Peter destroying Parker Industries and his fall from grace. Issues #792 and 793 were part of the &quot;Venom Inc.&quot; story. &quot;Threat Level: Red&quot; was the story for the next three issues which saw Norman Osborn obtain and bond with the Carnage symbiote. &quot;Go Down Swinging&quot; saw the results of the combination of Osborn&#x27;s goblin serum and Carnage symbiote creating the Red Goblin. Issue No. 801 was Dan Slott&#x27;s goodbye issue.

===2018 relaunch===
In March 2018, it was announced that writer Nick Spencer would be writing the main semi-monthly &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; series beginning with a new No. 1, replacing long-time writer Dan Slott, as part of the Fresh Start relaunch that July.
The first five-issue story arc was titled &#x27;Back to Basics.&#x27; During the &quot;Back to Basics&quot; story, Kindred, a mysterious villain with some relation to Peter&#x27;s past, was introduced, and Peter resumed his romantic relationship with Mary Jane once more. The first major story under Spencer was &quot;Hunted&quot; which ran through issues 16 through 23, the story also included four &quot;.HU&quot; issues for issues 16, 18, 19, and 20. The end of the story saw the death of long-running Spider-Man villain Kraven the Hunter, being replaced by his clone son, The Last Son of Kraven.

===2020s===

Issue 45 kicked off the &quot;Sins Rising&quot; story which saw the resurrected Sin-Eater carry out the plans of Kindred to cleanse the world of sin, particularly that of Norman Osborn. The story concluded with issue 49, issue 850 in legacy numbering, seeing Spider-Man and Green Goblin team up to defeat Sin-Eater. &quot;Last Remains&quot; started in issue 50 and concluded in issue 55, the story saw Kindred&#x27;s plans come to fruition as he tormented Spider-Man. The story has also seen five &quot;.LR&quot; for issues 50, 51, 52, 53, and 54 which focused on The Order of the Web, a new faction of Spider-People consisting of Julia Carpenter (Madame Web), Miles Morales (Spider-Man), Gwen Stacy (Ghost-Spider), Cindy Moon (Silk), Jessica Drew (Spider-Woman), and Anya Corazon (Spider-Girl) . The story also revealed that Kindred is Harry Osborn. &quot;Last Remains&quot; also received two fallout issues called &quot;Last Remains Post-Mortem&quot;.

Nick Spencer concluded his run with the &quot;Sinister War&quot; story which wrapped up in No. 74 (legacy numbering 875). The story saw several retcons to the Spider-Man mythos including that Kindred was Gabriel and Sarah Stacy all along, the fact that the Stacy twins were actually genetically engineered beings using Norman Osborn and Gwen Stacy&#x27;s DNA, that the Harry Osborn that returned in &quot;Brand New Day&quot; was actually a clone, and that Norman had made a deal with Mephisto where he sold Harry&#x27;s soul to the demon. The story ended with the deaths of the Harry clone, Gabriel, and Sarah and the real Harry&#x27;s soul being freed from Mephisto&#x27;s grasp.

After Spencer left the book, Marvel announced the &quot;Beyond&quot; era of Spider-Man would start in #75. The book would be moving back to the format it had during &quot;Brand New Day&quot; where it would have a rotating cast of writers including Kelly Thompson, Saladin Ahmed, Cody Ziglar, Patrick Gleason, and Zeb Wells. The book would also be released three times a month. &quot;Beyond&quot; would focus on Ben Reilly taking up the mantle of Spider-Man once again but backed by the Beyond corporation. Peter also falls ill and cannot be Spider-Man so he gives Ben his blessing to carry on as the main Spider-Man. However, following the conclusion of the storyline in #93, Peter has resumed active duties as Spider-Man, while Ben suffers a mental breakdown after losing his memories and becomes the villain Chasm.

===2022 relaunch===
In January 2022, it was announced that writer Zeb Wells and John Romita Jr. would be working on a relaunched &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, bringing the number of volumes for the title to its sixth, with the series beginning in April 2022 as a semi-monthly publication. The relaunch encompasses both a legacy numbering of #900 as well as the 60th anniversary for the character. The relaunch took place months after a mysterious event that left Peter on bad terms with the superhero community and ended his relationship with Mary Jane. He ends up taking a job at Oscorp and begins working closely with Norman Osborn (who becomes the heroic Gold Goblin) and starts dating Black Cat. The volume&#x27;s first crossover event was entitled &quot;Dark Web&quot;, with Chasm having teamed up with Madelyne Pryor to bring limbo to Earth.

It&#x27;s later revealed that Benjamin Rabin, the emissary of the Mayan god of mischief Wayeb&#x27;, sent Peter and Mary Jane to an alternate dimension to conduct a ceremony that would allow Wayeb to control the Earth. Peter was sent back to his Earth, while due to the alternative passage of time, Mary Jane and Paul, Rabin&#x27;s son in that dimension, spent four years in the realm together and adopted two children. When Peter eventually rescued them, Mary Jane refused to part with her new family. Rabin then planned to sacrifice Mary Jane to resurrect Wayeb, but is ultimately stopped by Ms. Marvel sacrificing herself, but not before Rabin reveals that Paul and Mary Jane&#x27;s kids were illusions created by him and ceased their existence. Mary Jane becomes the superheroine Jackpot using the bracelet acquired from the other dimension as Black Cat breaks up with Peter shortly before Janice Lincoln and Randy Robertson&#x27;s wedding. 

The second crossover event was entitled &quot;Gang War&quot;, where Peter led a team of street-level superheroes to stop a massive war between New York&#x27;s gangs led by Madam Masque, Tombstone, and Beetle. During an encounter with Kraven the Hunter, Peter temporarily becomes infected by Norman Osborn&#x27;s sins and becomes the villainous Spider-Goblin. Eventually, Norman&#x27;s sins return to him and he resumes being the Green Goblin. While fighting Spider-Man, the goblin reveals that he implanted a trigger phrase within Peters&#x27;s mind that would bring forth the Spider-Goblin persona. Norman then sends Spider-Goblin to attack the Sinister Six, who he brutally defeats, but is stopped from killing them due to the intervention of Chasm. With help from the Living Brain and his allies, Peter is able to purge himself and Norman of the Goblin for good. Wells&#x27; run ended in June 2024 with a climactic showdown between Spider-Man and Tombstone, where the former stops the latter from killing his daughter to establish his dominance over New York&#x27;s gangs. Peter also begins to date Shay Marken, a nurse at the Ravencroft Institute.

=== &quot;The 8 Deaths of Spider-Man&quot; ===
In July 2024, it was announced that following the conclusion of Wells&#x27; run, a 10-issue event would begin publication in the Fall called &quot;The 8 Deaths of Spider-Man&quot;. The series will be written by Joe Kelly and Justina Ireland and illustrated by Ed McGuinness and Gleb Melnikov. The event featured the recently crowned Sorcerer Supreme Doctor Doom designating Spider-Man as Earth&#x27;s champion to take on Doctor Strange&#x27;s annual task of facing the Scions of Cyttorak, giving him an arcane armor and eight reeds that could revive him if he got killed. After being killed several times and being forced to endure Cyra&#x27;s challenge of enduring the future deaths of his loved ones and millions of others, Peter became disillusioned and gave up until his inactivity nearly costs the lives of Aunt May and his friends. He uses his remaining reeds to resurrect them before teaming up with Juggernaut and the X-Men to take on Callix, who had killed his siblings.

=== 2025 relaunch ===
In December 2024, it was announced that Kelly would become the writer of a new volume of ASM that will launch after &quot;8 Deaths of Spider-Man&quot; in April 2025, with John Romita Jr. and Pepe Larraz providing the work on the art.

<text>Antigua and Barbuda is a sovereign archipelagic country composed of Antigua, Barbuda, and numerous other small islands. Antigua and Barbuda has a total area of 440 km2 (170 sq mi), making it one of the smallest countries in the Caribbean. The country is mostly flat, with the highest points on Antigua being in the Shekerley Mountains and on Barbuda the Highlands. The country has a tropical savanna climate, with pockets of tropical monsoon in Antigua&#x27;s southwest. Its largest city is St. John&#x27;s.
Hunter-gatherers settled the islands starting around 3,000 BC, likely arriving on canoes from Central and South America. They were followed by the Arawaks of Venezuela during the Ceramic Period. In 1493, Christopher Columbus surveyed the island of Antigua, which resulted in an attempt at Spanish settlement in 1520. Antigua remained uncolonised until 1632 when Edward Warner and his small party created the first successful British colony. Barbuda was under the control of the Codrington family until the 1860s. Antiguan independence was first proposed by Prince Klaas in 1728, who attempted to make the island an independent kingdom. After emancipation in 1834, Antigua&#x27;s autonomy slowly increased, while Barbuda was slowly integrated into Antigua. The first democratic elections were held in 1951, and by 1981, Antigua and Barbuda was independent. From 1960 until 2004, the Bird family dominated the archipelago&#x27;s politics with only one interruption, which ended with the election of Baldwin Spencer to the premiership.
Since 2014, the Labour Party has dominated national politics. Antigua and Barbuda is a member of the Commonwealth and a Commonwealth realm, being a constitutional monarchy with Charles III as its head of state. Barbuda has been governed by the Barbuda Council since 1976, the country being a unitary state. Antigua is also divided into six parishes. Antigua and Barbuda has a proportionally high foreign-born population, in addition to having the second highest Human Development Index in the Caribbean. Most people are of African descent, with significant populations of Europeans, Hispanics, and Indians. The country is also majority Christian, with most being Protestant. The most spoken language in the country is Antiguan and Barbudan Creole. Compared to neighboring countries, Antigua and Barbuda ranks highly in most economic indicators, although it ranks about average in political freedoms.

Antigua and Barbuda is a high-income country. It is a member of the United Nations, the OECS, the Regional Security System, CARICOM, and the World Trade Organisation. Antigua and Barbuda is one of the only countries in the Caribbean to maintain an air force, and has a significant aviation industry in conjunction with its tourism-based economy.

== Etymology ==
 is Spanish for &#x27;ancient&#x27; and is Spanish for &#x27;bearded&#x27;. The island of Antigua was originally called by the Arawaks and is locally known by that name today; the Caribs possibly called Barbuda . Christopher Columbus, while sailing by in 1493, may have named it , after an icon in the Spanish Seville Cathedral. The &quot;bearded&quot; of Barbuda is thought to refer either to the male inhabitants of the island, or the bearded fig trees present there.

==History==
===Pre-colonial period===

Antigua was first settled by archaic age Indigenous hunter-gatherers called the Ciboney. Carbon dating has established the earliest settlements started around 3100 BC. They were succeeded by the ceramic age pre-Columbian Arawak-speaking Saladoid people who migrated from the lower Orinoco River. They introduced agriculture, raising, among other crops, the famous Antigua Black Pineapple (&quot;Ananas comosus&quot;), corn, sweet potatoes, chiles, guava, tobacco, and cotton. Later on the Caribs settled the island.

===European arrival and slavery===
Christopher Columbus was the first European to sight the islands in 1493. The Spanish did not colonise Antigua until after a combination of European and African diseases, malnutrition, and slavery eventually extirpated most of the native population; smallpox was probably the greatest killer.

The English settled on Antigua in 1632; Christopher Codrington settled on Barbuda in 1685. Tobacco and then sugar was grown, worked by a large population of slaves transported from West Africa, who soon came to vastly outnumber the European settlers.

===Colonial era===
The English maintained control of the islands, repulsing an attempted French attack in 1666. The brutal conditions endured by the slaves led to revolts in 1701 and 1729 and a planned revolt in 1736, the last led by Prince Klaas, though it was discovered before it began and the ringleaders were executed. Slavery was abolished in the British Empire in 1833, affecting the economy. This was exacerbated by natural disasters such as the 1843 earthquake and the 1847 hurricane. Mining occurred on the isle of Redonda, however, this ceased in 1929 and the island has since remained uninhabited.

Part of the Leeward Islands colony, Antigua and Barbuda became part of the short-lived West Indies Federation from 1958 to 1962. Antigua and Barbuda subsequently became an associated state of the United Kingdom with full internal autonomy on 27 February 1967. The 1970s were dominated by discussions as to the islands&#x27; future and the rivalry between Vere Bird of the Antigua and Barbuda Labour Party (ABLP) (Premier from 1967 to 1971 and 1976 to 1981) and the Progressive Labour Movement (PLM) of George Walter (Premier 1971–1976). Eventually, Antigua and Barbuda gained full independence on 1 November 1981; Vere Bird became prime minister of the new country. The country opted to remain within the Commonwealth, retaining Elizabeth II () as head of state, with the first governor, Sir Wilfred Jacobs, as governor-general. Succeeding Wilfred Jacobs were James Carlisle (1993–2007), Louise Lake-Tack (2007–2014), and the present since 2014 being Rodney Williams.

===Independence era===
The first two decades of Antigua&#x27;s independence were dominated politically by the Bird family and the ABLP, with Vere Bird ruling from 1981 to 1994, followed by his son Lester Bird from 1994 to 2004. Though providing a degree of political stability, and boosting tourism to the country, the Bird governments were frequently accused of corruption, cronyism and financial malfeasance. Vere Bird Jr., the elder son, was forced to leave the cabinet in 1990 following a scandal in which he was accused of smuggling Israeli weapons to Colombian drug-traffickers. Another son, Ivor Bird, was convicted of selling cocaine in 1995.

In 1995, Hurricane Luis caused severe damage on Barbuda.

The ABLP&#x27;s dominance of Antiguan politics ended with the 2004 Antiguan general election, which was won by Winston Baldwin Spencer&#x27;s United Progressive Party (UPP). Winston Baldwin Spencer was Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda from 2004 to 2014. However the UPP lost the 2014 Antiguan general election, with the ABLP returning to power under Gaston Browne. ABLP won 15 of the 17 seats in the 2018 snap election under the leadership of incumbent Prime Minister Gaston Browne.

In 2016, Nelson&#x27;s Dockyard was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Most of Barbuda was devastated in early September 2017 by Hurricane Irma, which brought winds with speeds reaching 295 km/h (185 mph). The storm damaged or destroyed 95% of the island&#x27;s buildings and infrastructure, leaving Barbuda &quot;barely habitable&quot; according to Prime Minister Gaston Browne. Nearly everyone on the island was evacuated to Antigua.
Amidst the following rebuilding efforts on Barbuda that were estimated to cost at least $100 million, the government announced plans to revoke a century-old law of communal land ownership by allowing residents to buy land; a move that has been criticised as promoting &quot;disaster capitalism&quot;.

==Geography==
Limestone formations, rather than volcanic activity, have had the most impact on the topography of both Antigua and Barbuda, which are both relatively low-lying islands. Boggy Peak, also known as Mt. Obama from 2008 to 2016, is the highest point on both Antigua and Barbuda. It is the remnant of a volcanic crater and rises a total of 402 meters. Boggy Peak is located in the southwest of Antigua (1,319 feet).

Both of these islands have very irregularly shaped coastlines that are dotted with beaches, lagoons, and natural harbours. There are reefs and shoals that surround the islands on all sides. Because of the low amount of rainfall, there are not many streams. On neither of these islands can sufficient quantities of fresh groundwater be found.

Redonda is a small, uninhabited island located about 40 kilometres (25 miles) to the south-west of Antigua. Redonda is a rocky island.

In Antigua and Barbuda forest cover is about 18% of the total land area, equivalent to 8,120 ha of forests in 2020, down from 10,110 ha in 1990.

=== Cities and villages ===

The most populous cities in Antigua and Barbuda are mostly on Antigua, being Saint John&#x27;s, All Saints, Piggotts, and Liberta. The most populous city on Barbuda is Codrington. It is estimated that 25% of the population lives in an urban area, which is much lower than the international average of 55%.

===Islands===
Antigua and Barbuda consists mostly of its two namesake islands, Antigua, and Barbuda. Other than that, Antigua and Barbuda&#x27;s biggest islands are Guiana Island and Long Island off the coast of Antigua, and Redonda island, which is far from both of the main islands.

=== Climate ===
Rainfall averages per year, with the amount varying widely from season to season. In general the wettest period is between September and November. The islands generally experience low humidity and recurrent droughts. Temperatures average , with a range from to in the winter to from to in the summer and autumn. The coolest period is between December and February.

Hurricanes strike on an average of once a year, including the powerful Category 5 Hurricane Irma, on 6 September 2017, which damaged 95% of the structures on Barbuda. Some 1,800 people were evacuated to Antigua.

Officials quoted by &quot;Time&quot; indicated that over $100 million would be required to rebuild homes and infrastructure. Philmore Mullin, Director of Barbuda&#x27;s National Office of Disaster Services, said that &quot;all critical infrastructure and utilities are non-existent – food supply, medicine, shelter, electricity, water, communications, waste management&quot;. He summarised the situation as follows: &quot;Public utilities need to be rebuilt in their entirety... It is optimistic to think anything can be rebuilt in six months ... In my 25 years in disaster management, I have never seen something like this.&quot;

=== Environmental issues ===
==Demographics==

===Ethnic groups===

Antigua has a population of , mostly made up of people of West African, British, and Portuguese descent. The ethnic distribution consists of 91% Black, 4.4% mixed race, 1.7% White, and 2.9% other (primarily East Indian). Most Whites are of British descent. Christian Levantine Arabs and a small number of East Asians and Sephardic Jews make up the remainder of the population.

An increasingly large percentage of the population lives abroad, most notably in the United Kingdom (Antiguan Britons), the United States and Canada. A minority of Antiguan residents are immigrants from other countries, particularly from Dominica, Guyana and Jamaica, and, increasingly, from the Dominican Republic, St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Nigeria. An estimated 4,500 American citizens also make their home in Antigua and Barbuda, making their numbers one of the largest American populations in the English-speaking Eastern Caribbean. 68.47% of the population was born in Antigua and Barbuda.

===Languages===

The language most commonly used in business is English. There is a noticeable distinction between the Antiguan accent and the Barbudan one.

When compared to Antiguan Creole, Standard English was the language of choice in the years leading up to Antigua and Barbuda&#x27;s attainment of their independence. The Antiguan Creole language is looked down upon by the upper and middle classes in general. The Antiguan Creole language is discouraged from use in the educational system, and instruction is carried out in Standard (British) English instead.

A significant number of the words that are used in the Antiguan dialect are derived from both the British and African languages. This is readily apparent in phrases such as &quot;Innit?&quot; which literally translates to &quot;Isn&#x27;t it?&quot; Many common island proverbs can be traced back to Africa, such as the pidgin language.

Approximately 10,000 people are able to speak in Spanish.

=== Education ===
===Religion===
A majority (77%) of Antiguans are Christians, with the Anglicans (17.6%) being the largest single denomination. Other Christian denominations present are Seventh-day Adventist Church (12.4%), Pentecostalism (12.2%), Moravian Church (8.3%), Roman Catholics
(8.2%), Methodist Church (5.6%), Wesleyan Holiness Church (4.5%), Church of God (4.1%), Baptists (3.6%), Mormonism (&lt;1.0%), as well as Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses.

== Government and politics ==
=== Government ===

Antigua and Barbuda is a unitary parliamentary democracy under a constitutional monarchy. The current Constitution of Antigua and Barbuda was adopted upon independence on 1 November 1981. This replaced the pre-independence constitution of the Associated State of Antigua, which did not thoroughly define the relationship between the two islands. The island of Barbuda maintains much autonomy, while the island of Antigua is directly governed by the national government.

The executive branch has two primary leaders. The Governor-General, currently Rodney Williams, exercises the functions of the Monarch of Antigua and Barbuda, in whom executive power is vested in. The Governor-General serves at the pleasure of the Monarch, and usually serves a similar term to that of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister, currently , is the head of government, and is appointed by the Governor-General. The Prime Minister must be a member of the House of Representatives, and must be the member of the House of Representatives who is most likely to command the support of the majority of members. The Governor-General has the ability to dissolve Parliament on the advice of the Prime Minister, or when the majority of the members of the House of Representatives pass a motion of no confidence, and the Prime Minister does not within seven days resign or advise the Governor-General to dissolve Parliament.

The legislative power of Antigua and Barbuda is vested in Parliament, which is composed of the Monarch, the Senate, and the House of Representatives. The Senate is composed of seventeen members, who are appointed by the Governor-General. Ten of the members are appointed on the advice of the Prime Minister, these members being known as government senators. An eleventh government senator is also appointed on the advice of the Prime Minister, who must be an inhabitant of Barbuda. Four of the members are appointed on the advice of the Leader of the Opposition, these senators being known as opposition senators. One of the members is appointed on the advice of the Barbuda Council, and an independent senator is appointed under the discretion of the Governor-General himself. The House of Representatives is currently composed of seventeen elected members, as well as the Speaker of the House, who is elected by the members of the House itself. The Attorney General, while currently an elected member of Parliament, Steadroy Benjamin, may also be appointed to the House of Representatives as an &quot;ex officio&quot; member. The Attorney-General also attends sittings of the Senate. Any bill except money bills may be introduced in either chamber: money bills may only be introduced in the House. Parliament may not amend the Barbuda Local Government Act without the consent of the Barbuda Council.

The judiciary of Antigua and Barbuda is composed of the magistrates&#x27; courts, the Supreme Court including the High Court and the Court of Appeal, and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, the country&#x27;s final court. Antiguan and Barbudan voters rejected a proposal to make the Caribbean Court of Justice the final court in 2018. Antigua and Barbuda is composed of three magistrates&#x27; courts districts, and is part of the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court system. The acting chief justice of the Supreme Court is Mario Michel, serving since 5 May 2024.

Since the 1990s, the two major parties in Antigua have been the centre-right (formerly left-wing) Antigua and Barbuda Labour Party, and the left-wing social democratic United Progressive Party. The Labour Party and its predecessors have traditionally been the dominant party on the national level since the 1946 general elections, with brief pauses during the Progressive Labour Movement government (predecessor of the UPP) from 1971 to 1976, and the United Progressive Party government from 2004 until 2014. On Barbuda, dominant party is traditionally the Barbuda People&#x27;s Movement, being the only political grouping in the Barbuda Council since 2021.

=== Administrative divisions ===
Antigua and Barbuda is composed of six parishes and two dependencies. Saint John is the most populous parish, home to well over half of Antigua and Barbuda&#x27;s population. During colonial times, the parishes were governed by parish vestries, however, the parishes now lack any sort of government. Since the 2023 general elections, various proposals have been made to establish parish councils, however, as of January 2025, none have been established. The dependency of Redonda is part of the parish of Saint John under the Redonda Annexation Act, in Magistrates&#x27; District &quot;A&quot;.

Local government in Antigua and Barbuda is completely inactive, except for the Barbuda Council which is enshrined in the Constitution. Antigua historically had a system of village councils in the 1940s (although the legislation was never repealed), however, the Gaston Browne administration has expressed opposition to all forms of local governance. St. John&#x27;s also historically had a city council during the late 1800s and early 1900s, however the St. John&#x27;s Development Corporation has since consumed most of its functions.

=== Foreign relations ===

The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Barbuda Affairs is responsible for overseeing the foreign relations of Antigua and Barbuda. The current minister is Paul Chet Greene. Antigua and Barbuda is a founding member of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States, as well as a member of the United Nations, the Caribbean Community, the Alliance of Small Island States, and the World Trade Organisation.

Antigua and Barbuda&#x27;s foreign policy has been described by Gaston Browne as &quot;we are friends of all; enemies of none&quot;. Antigua and Barbuda has rejected the notion that it is in any country&#x27;s &quot;backyard&quot;. Antigua and Barbuda usually maintains close relations with other Small Island Developing States, and has hosted various summits on that subject. The United Nations has also praised Antigua and Barbuda for its &quot;United Nations-based multilateralism&quot; efforts. Antigua and Barbuda also has close relations with many Caribbean countries and territories, especially Montserrat, which Antigua and Barbuda accepted 3,000 refugees from in 1997 after the Soufrière Hills eruption. Many policies adopted by the Antiguan and Barbudan government have also often had an impact on Montserrat, due to Antigua and Barbuda hosting the only air and transportation links into the territory.

=== Defence and national security ===
The Minister of Finance, Corporate Governance and Public Private Partnerships is responsible for the Antigua and Barbuda Defence Force, the country&#x27;s military. The Minister of Legal Affairs, Public Safety, Immigration and Labour is responsible for the national security of Antigua and Barbuda. The Defence Force consists of the Regiment (army), the Air Wing, the Coast Guard, and the Service and Support Unit. The Defence Force is led by the Chief of Defence Staff, who is subject to the orders of the Governor-General. The Defence Force is headquartered at Camp Blizzard.

The National Security Council is responsible for the coordination of Antigua and Barbuda&#x27;s national security. The National Security Adviser is a member of the council and is responsible for the gathering of intelligence and information on national security matters.

The Royal Police Force of Antigua and Barbuda is the national police department. The Special Service Unit is Antigua and Barbuda&#x27;s police tactical unit. The Police Force is composed of four lettered regional divisions, and subordinated service districts.

===Human rights===

Same-sex sexual activity has been legal in Antigua and Barbuda since July 2022.

==Economy==
Tourism dominates the economy, accounting for more than half of the gross domestic product (GDP). As a destination for the most affluent travelers, Antigua is well known for its extensive collection of five-star resorts. However, weaker tourist activity in lower and middle market segments since the beginning of the year 2000 has slowed the economy and put the government into a tight fiscal corner. Antigua and Barbuda has enacted policies to attract high-net-worth citizens and residents, such as enacting a 0% personal income tax rate in 2019.

The provision of investment banking and financial services also constitutes a significant portion of the economy. Major international financial institutions such as the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Scotiabank both maintain offices in Antigua. PriceWaterhouseCoopers, Pannell Kerr Forster, and KPMG are some of the other companies in the financial services industry that have offices in Antigua. In February 2009 the United States Securities and Exchange Commission leveled allegations against the Antigua-based Stanford International Bank, part of the Stanford Financial Group, which was owned by Texas billionaire Allen Stanford, of orchestrating a massive fraud that resulted in the theft of approximately $8 billion from investors. He was charged and arrested later that year. In March 2012 he was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.

The nation, which consists of two islands, directs the majority of its agricultural production toward the markets that are found within the nation. This is done despite the fact that the nation has a limited water supply and a shortage of laborers as a result of the higher wages offered in the tourism and construction industries.

Manufacturing comprises 2% of GDP and is made up of enclave-type assembly for export, the major products being bedding, handicrafts, and electronic components. Prospects for economic growth in the medium term will continue to depend on income growth in the industrialised world, especially in the United States, from which about one-third to one-half of all tourists come.

Access to biocapacity is lower than world average. In 2016, Antigua and Barbuda had 0.8 global hectares of biocapacity per person within its territory, much less than the world average of 1.6 global hectares per person. In 2016, Antigua and Barbuda used 4.3 global hectares of biocapacity per person – their ecological footprint of consumption. This means they use more biocapacity than Antigua and Barbuda contains. As a result, Antigua and Barbuda are running a biocapacity deficit.

The Citizenship by Investment Unit (CIU) is the government authority responsible for processing all applications for Agent&#x27;s Licenses as well as all applications for Citizenship by Investment made by applicants and their family members. This unit was established by the Prime Minister and is known as the Citizenship by Investment Unit.

== Culture ==


The music of Antigua and Barbuda has some African characteristics, with minimal influence from European music, but the music is distinct. The first known records of music in Antigua and Barbuda dates back to Christopher Columbus&#x27; discovery of the island nation in 1493, when it was still home to Arawak and Carib people. Still, very little research has been done on early music from the islands. African labourers are documented in history to have danced outside in the 1780s to the toombah (later tum tum), a drum adorned with tin and shell jingles, and the banjar (later bangoe, maybe related to the European banjo). Antigua&#x27;s indigenous music, known as Benna, came into being after slavery was abolished. Benna uses a call-and-response format, and its audience is typically interested in obscene gossip and rumours. Benna was widely utilised as a popular communication tool by the beginning of the 20th century, disseminating information around the island.
Benna has long been eclipsed by Calypso and increasingly Soca, which includes South Asian rhythms.

The art of Antigua and Barbuda began with the Arawak people. Their artwork included pictographs and petroglyphs. These geometric shapes, animals, and plant artworks are said to have been used for ceremonial or religious purposes. Painting, sculpture, and ceramics were among the artistic traditions that European settlers brought to Antigua and Barbuda. Local painters used European art forms to produce Antiguan and Barbudan art in their own unique styles. Social issues, nature, and Caribbean identity were the subjects of this artwork. Traditional crafts from Antigua and Barbuda include scrimshaw, pottery, sculptures, ethnic dolls, and photography.

Every year, on the island of Antigua, people celebrate their freedom from slavery with the Antigua Carnival modelled after European pre-Lent Carnival. Over thirteen days, there are brightly coloured costumes, talent events, beauty pageants and music. The celebration runs from late July to Carnival Tuesday, the first Tuesday in August. On the island, Carnival Tuesday and Monday are both observed as public holidays. In an effort to boost travel to Antigua and Barbuda, the Old Time Christmas Festival was replaced in 1957 by the Antiguan Carnival. Another annual festival held in Antigua is Antigua Sailing Week. Sailing Week is a week-long yacht regatta held in the waters of English Harbour. Sailing Week was founded in 1967 and is known for being one of the top regattas in the world. The main festival held in Barbuda is Caribana. Caribana takes place every year during Whit Monday weekend and features various pageants, calypso competitions, and weekend beach parties.

Antigua and Barbuda has eleven public holidays. On the advice of the Cabinet, the Governor-General may also proclaim other holidays. Historically, about three weeks before Christmas Day, carol singers would roam the various villages, carrying carol trees and lanterns. &quot;John Bulls&quot; are replicas of &quot;masked African witch doctors&quot;, that often dominated the country&#x27;s Christmas festivities. Jazz bands were also common sights, dressed in red and green clown costumes.

=== Cuisine ===
 The islands&#x27; cuisine is mostly of European origin (UK and Portugal) with regional ingredients. Fungee (pronounced &quot;foon-jee&quot;) and pepperpot are the national dishes. Fungee is a cornmeal-based dish that resembles polenta Other national foods include saltfish (cod), lobster (from Barbuda), ducana (a sweet dumpling made from sweet potatoes amd coconut), and seasoned rice, similar to palau or arroz con pollo. Additionally, there are confections such as peanut brittle, sugar cake (made from coconut and sugar), fudge, and raspberry (local) and tamarind stew (sauce). The Antigua black pineapple is prized for its juicy, sweet flesh. It is a well-liked fruit in the area and is included in many regional specialties and sweets. It is said to be the sweetest variety of pineapple.

An important part of the Antiguan and Barbudan breakfast is Antigua Sunday bread. It is sold in many bakeries on both islands, and instead of being made with butter, it is made with lard. There are often decorative twists on the crust of the bread. Antiguan raisin buns, often called &quot;bun and cheese&quot;, is another traditional bread, which is sweet and most popular during Easter. It is sometimes made with spices such as nutmeg.

=== Sport ===

Cricket is the most popular sport within the islands. With Sir Isaac Vivian Alexander Richards who represented the West Indies cricket team between 1974 and 1991, Antigua had one of the world&#x27;s most famous batsmen ever. The Antigua and Barbuda national cricket team represented the country at the 1998 Commonwealth Games, but Antiguan cricketers otherwise play for the Leeward Islands cricket team in domestic matches and the West Indies cricket team internationally. Teams from the various villages and parishes compete in the Parish League.

Association football is the second most popular sport in the country, with the Antigua and Barbuda national football team being founded in 1928.

<doc id="953" wikidata="Q238339" url="?curid=953" title="Azincourt">
<text>Azincourt ( ; ) is a commune in the Pas-de-Calais department in northern France. It is situated north-west of Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise on the D71 road between Hesdin and Fruges. 

The Late Medieval Battle of Agincourt between the English and the French took place in the commune in 1415.

==Toponym==
The name is attested as &quot;Aisincurt&quot; in 1175, derived from a Germanic masculine name Aizo, Aizino and the early Northern French word &quot;curt&quot; (which meant a farm with a courtyard; derived from the Late Latin &quot;cortem&quot;). It is often known as Agincourt in English. There is a village that is named &quot;Agincourt&quot;, located in the Meurthe-et-Moselle department in Eastern France. The name has no etymological link with Azincourt, and is derived separately from another Germanic male name &quot;*Ingin-&quot;.

==History==
Azincourt is known for being near the site of the battle fought on 25 October 1415 in which the army led by King Henry V of England defeated the forces led by Charles d&#x27;Albret on behalf of Charles VI of France, which has gone down in history as the Battle of Agincourt. According to M. Forrest, the French knights were so encumbered by their armour that they were exhausted even before the start of the battle.

After he became king in 1509, Henry VIII is purported to have commissioned an English translation of a Life of Henry V so that he could emulate him, on the grounds that he thought that launching a campaign against France would help him to impose himself on the European stage. In 1513, Henry VIII crossed the English Channel, stopping by at Azincourt.

The battle, as was the tradition, was named after a nearby castle called Azincourt. The castle has since disappeared and the settlement now known as Azincourt adopted the name in the seventeenth century.

John Cassell wrote in 1857 that &quot;the village of Azincourt itself is now a group of dirty farmhouses and wretched cottages, but where the hottest of the battle raged, between that village and the commune of Tramecourt, there still remains a wood precisely corresponding with the one in which Henry placed his ambush; and there are yet existing the foundations of the castle of Azincourt, from which the king named the field.&quot;

==Population==
==Sights==
The original battlefield museum in the village featured model knights made out of Action Man figures. This has now been replaced by the Centre historique médiéval d&#x27;Azincourt (CHM)—a more professional museum, conference centre and exhibition space incorporating laser, video, slide shows, audio commentaries, and some interactive elements. The museum building is shaped like a longbow similar to those used at the battle by archers under King Henry.

Since 2004 a large medieval festival organised by the local community, the CHM, The Azincourt Alliance, and various other UK societies commemorating the battle, local history and medieval life, arts and crafts has been held in the village. Prior to this date the festival was held in October, but due to the inclement weather and local heavy clay soil (like the battle) making the festival difficult, it was moved to the last Sunday in July.

==International relations==
Azincourt is twinned with Middleham, United Kingdom.

<text>Berthold Konrad Hermann Albert Speer (; ; 19 March 1905 – 1 September 1981) was a German architect who served as the Minister of Armaments and War Production in Nazi Germany during most of World War II. A close ally of Adolf Hitler, he was convicted at the Nuremberg trials and sentenced to 20 years in prison.

An architect by training, Speer joined the Nazi Party in 1931. His architectural skills made him increasingly prominent within the Party, and he became a member of Hitler&#x27;s inner circle. Hitler commissioned him to design and construct structures, including the Reich Chancellery and the Nazi Party rally grounds in Nuremberg. In 1937, Hitler appointed Speer as General Building Inspector for Berlin. In this capacity he was responsible for the Central Department for Resettlement that evicted Jewish tenants from their homes in Berlin. In February 1942, Speer was appointed as Reich Minister of Armaments and War Production. Using misleading statistics, he promoted himself as having performed an armaments miracle that was widely credited with keeping Germany in the war. In 1944, Speer established a task force to increase production of fighter aircraft. It became instrumental in exploiting slave labor for the benefit of the German war effort.

After the war, Albert Speer was among the 24 &quot;major war criminals&quot; charged by the International Military Tribunal for Nazi atrocities. He was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity, principally for the use of slave labor, narrowly avoiding a death sentence. Having served his full term, Speer was released in 1966. He used his writings from the time of imprisonment as the basis for two autobiographical books, &quot;Inside the Third Reich&quot; and &quot;&quot;. Speer&#x27;s books were a success; the public was fascinated by the inside view of the Third Reich he provided. He died of a stroke in 1981.

Through his autobiographies and interviews, Speer carefully constructed an image of himself as a man who deeply regretted having failed to discover the crimes of the Third Reich. He continued to deny explicit knowledge of, and responsibility for, the Holocaust. This image dominated his historiography in the decades following the war, giving rise to the &quot;Speer myth&quot;: the perception of him as an apolitical technocrat responsible for revolutionizing the German war machine. The myth began to fall apart in the 1980s, when the armaments miracle was attributed to Nazi propaganda. Twenty-five years after Speer&#x27;s death, Adam Tooze wrote in &quot;The Wages of Destruction&quot; that the idea that Speer was an apolitical technocrat was &quot;absurd&quot;. Martin Kitchen, writing in &quot;&quot;, stated that much of the increase in Germany&#x27;s arms production was actually due to systems instituted by Speer&#x27;s predecessor (Fritz Todt) and that Speer was intimately aware of and involved in the &quot;Final Solution&quot;; evidence of which has been conclusively shown in the decades following the Nuremberg trials. 
==Early years and personal life==
Speer was born in Mannheim, into an upper-middle-class family. He was the second of three sons of Luise Máthilde Wilhelmine (Hommel) and Albert Friedrich Speer. In 1918, the family leased their Mannheim residence and moved to a home they had in Heidelberg. Henry T. King, deputy prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials who later wrote a book about Speer said, &quot;Love and warmth were lacking in the household of Speer&#x27;s youth.&quot; His brothers, Ernst and Hermann, bullied him throughout his childhood. Speer was active in sports, taking up skiing and mountaineering. He followed in the footsteps of his father and grandfather and studied architecture.

Speer began his architectural studies at the University of Karlsruhe instead of a more highly acclaimed institution because the hyperinflation crisis of 1923 limited his parents&#x27; income. In 1924, when the crisis had abated, he transferred to the &quot;much more reputable&quot; Technische Hochschule München (now Technical University of Munich). In 1925, he transferred again, this time to the Technische Hochschule Berlin-Chalottenburg (now Technische Universität Berlin) where he studied under Heinrich Tessenow, whom Speer greatly admired. After passing his exams in 1927, Speer became Tessenow&#x27;s assistant, a high honor for a man of 22. As such, Speer taught some of his classes while continuing his own postgraduate studies. In Munich Speer began a close friendship, ultimately spanning over 50 years, with Rudolf Wolters, who also studied under Tessenow.

In mid-1922, Speer began courting Margarete (Margret) Weber (1905–1987), the daughter of a successful craftsman who employed 50 workers. The relationship was frowned upon by Speer&#x27;s class-conscious mother, who felt the Webers were socially inferior. Despite this opposition, the two married in Berlin on 28 August 1928; seven years elapsed before Margarete was invited to stay at her in-laws&#x27; home. The couple would have six children together, but Albert Speer grew increasingly distant from his family after 1933. He remained so even after his release from imprisonment in 1966, despite their efforts to forge closer bonds.

==Party architect and government functionary==
===Joining the Nazis (1931–1934)===
In January 1931, Speer applied for Nazi Party membership, and on 1 March 1931, he became member number 474,481. The same year, with stipends shrinking amid the Depression, Speer surrendered his position as Tessenow&#x27;s assistant and moved to Mannheim, hoping to make a living as an architect. After he failed to do so, his father gave him a part-time job as manager of his properties. In July 1932, the Speers visited Berlin to help out the Party before the &quot;Reichstag&quot; elections. While they were there his friend, Nazi Party official Karl Hanke recommended the young architect to Joseph Goebbels to help renovate the Party&#x27;s Berlin headquarters. When the commission was completed, Speer returned to Mannheim and remained there as Hitler took office in January 1933.

The organizers of the 1933 Nuremberg Rally asked Speer to submit designs for the rally, bringing him into contact with Hitler for the first time. Neither the organizers nor Rudolf Hess were willing to decide whether to approve the plans, and Hess sent Speer to Hitler&#x27;s Munich apartment to seek his approval. This work won Speer his first national post, as Nazi Party &quot;Commissioner for the Artistic and Technical Presentation of Party Rallies and Demonstrations&quot;.

Shortly after Hitler came into power, he began to make plans to rebuild the chancellery. At the end of 1933, he contracted Paul Troost to renovate the entire building. Hitler appointed Speer, whose work for Goebbels had impressed him, to manage the building site for Troost. As Chancellor, Hitler had a residence in the building and came by every day to be briefed by Speer and the building supervisor on the progress of the renovations. After one of these briefings, Hitler invited Speer to lunch, to the architect&#x27;s great excitement. Speer quickly became part of Hitler&#x27;s inner circle; he was expected to call on him in the morning for a walk or chat, to provide consultation on architectural matters, and to discuss Hitler&#x27;s ideas. Most days he was invited to dinner.

In the English version of his memoirs, Speer says that his political commitment merely consisted of paying his &quot;monthly dues&quot;. He assumed his German readers would not be so gullible and told them the Nazi Party offered a &quot;new mission&quot;. He was more forthright in an interview with William Hamsher in which he said he joined the party in order to save &quot;Germany from Communism&quot;. After the war, he claimed to have had little interest in politics at all and had joined almost by chance. Like many of those in power in the Third Reich, he was not an ideologue, &quot;nor was he anything more than an instinctive anti-Semite.&quot; Historian Magnus Brechtken, discussing Speer, said he did not give anti-Jewish public speeches and that his anti-Semitism can best be understood through his actions—which were anti-Semitic. Brechtken added that, throughout Speer&#x27;s life, his central motives were to gain power, rule, and acquire wealth.

===Nazi architect (1934–1937)===
When Troost died on 21 January 1934, Speer effectively replaced him as the Party&#x27;s chief architect. Hitler appointed Speer as head of the Chief Office for Construction, which placed him nominally on Hess&#x27; staff.

One of Speer&#x27;s first commissions after Troost&#x27;s death was the &quot;Zeppelinfeld&quot; stadium in Nuremberg. It was used for Nazi propaganda rallies and can be seen in Leni Riefenstahl&#x27;s propaganda film &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot;. The building was able to hold 340,000 people. Speer insisted that as many events as possible be held at night, both to give greater prominence to his lighting effects and to hide the overweight Nazis. Nuremberg was the site of many official Nazi buildings. Many more buildings were planned. If built, the German Stadium in Nuremberg would have accommodated 400,000 spectators. Speer modified Werner March&#x27;s design for the Olympic Stadium being built for the 1936 Summer Olympics. He added a stone exterior that pleased Hitler. Speer designed the German Pavilion for the 1937 international exposition in Paris.
===Berlin&#x27;s General Building Inspector (1937–1942)===
On 30 January 1937, Hitler appointed Speer as General Building Inspector for the Reich Capital. This carried with it the rank of State Secretary in the Reich government and gave him extraordinary powers over the Berlin city government. He was to report directly to Hitler, and was independent of both the mayor and the Gauleiter of Berlin. Hitler ordered Speer to develop plans to rebuild Berlin. These centered on a three-mile-long grand boulevard running from north to south, which Speer called the &quot;Prachtstrasse&quot;, or Street of Magnificence; he also referred to it as the &quot;North–South Axis&quot;. At the northern end of the boulevard, Speer planned to build the &quot;Volkshalle&quot;, a huge domed assembly hall over high, with floor space for 180,000 people. At the southern end of the avenue, a great triumphal arch, almost high and able to fit the Arc de Triomphe inside its opening, was planned. The existing Berlin railroad termini were to be dismantled, and two large new stations built. Speer hired Wolters as part of his design team, with special responsibility for the &quot;Prachtstrasse&quot;. The outbreak of World War II in 1939 led to the postponement, and later the abandonment, of these plans, which, after Nazi capitulation, Speer himself considered as “awful”.

Plans to build a new Reich Chancellery had been underway since 1934. Land had been purchased by the end of 1934 and starting in March 1936 the first buildings were demolished to create space at Voßstraße. Speer was involved virtually from the beginning. In the aftermath of the Night of the Long Knives, he had been commissioned to renovate the Borsig Palace on the corner of Voßstraße and Wilhelmstraße as headquarters of the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA). He completed the preliminary work for the new chancellery by May 1936. In June 1936 he charged a personal honorarium of 30,000 Reichsmark and estimated the chancellery would be completed within three to four years. Detailed plans were completed in July 1937 and the first shell of the new chancellery was complete on 1 January 1938. On 27 January 1938, Speer received plenipotentiary powers from Hitler to finish the new chancellery by 1 January 1939. For propaganda Hitler claimed during the topping-out ceremony on 2 August 1938, that he had ordered Speer to complete the new chancellery that year. Shortages of labor meant the construction workers had to work in ten-to-twelve-hour shifts. The &quot;SS&quot; built two concentration camps in 1938 and used the inmates to quarry stone for its construction. A brick factory was built near the Oranienburg concentration camp at Speer&#x27;s behest; when someone commented on the poor conditions there, Speer stated, &quot;The Yids got used to making bricks while in Egyptian captivity&quot;. The chancellery was completed in early January 1939. The building itself was hailed by Hitler as the &quot;crowning glory of the greater German political empire&quot;.
During the Chancellery project, the pogrom of &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; took place. Speer made no mention of it in the first draft of &quot;Inside the Third Reich&quot;. It was only on the urgent advice of his publisher that he added a mention of seeing the ruins of the Central Synagogue in Berlin from his car. &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; accelerated Speer&#x27;s ongoing efforts to dispossess Berlin&#x27;s Jews from their homes. From 1939 on, Speer&#x27;s Department used the Nuremberg Laws to evict Jewish tenants of non-Jewish landlords in Berlin, to make way for non-Jewish tenants displaced by redevelopment or bombing. Eventually, 75,000 Jews were displaced by these measures. Speer denied he knew they were being put on Holocaust trains and claimed that those displaced were, &quot;Completely free and their families were still in their apartments&quot;. He also said: &quot; ... en route to my ministry on the city highway, I could see ... crowds of people on the platform of nearby Nikolassee Railroad Station. I knew that these must be Berlin Jews who were being evacuated. I am sure that an oppressive feeling struck me as I drove past. I presumably had a sense of somber events.&quot; Matthias Schmidt said Speer had personally inspected concentration camps and described his comments as an &quot;outright farce&quot;. Martin Kitchen described Speer&#x27;s often repeated line that he knew nothing of the &quot;dreadful things&quot; as hollow—not only was he fully aware of the fate of the Jews, he actively participated in their persecution.

As Germany started World War II in Europe, Speer instituted quick-reaction squads to construct roads or clear away debris; before long, these units would be used to clear bomb sites. Speer used forced Jewish labor on these projects, in addition to regular German workers. Construction stopped on the Berlin and Nüremberg plans at the outbreak of war. Though stockpiling of materials and other work continued, this slowed to a halt as more resources were needed for the armament industry. Speer&#x27;s offices undertook building work for each branch of the military, and for the SS, using slave labor. Speer&#x27;s building work made him among the wealthiest of the Nazi elite.

==Minister of Armaments==
===Appointment and increasing power===

As one of the younger and more ambitious men in Hitler&#x27;s inner circle, Speer was approaching the height of his power. In 1938, Prussian Minister President Hermann Göring had appointed him to the Prussian State Council. In 1941, he was elected to the &quot;Reichstag&quot; from electoral constituency 2 (Berlin–West). On 8 February 1942, Reich Minister of Armaments and Munitions Fritz Todt died in a plane crash shortly after taking off from Hitler&#x27;s eastern headquarters at Rastenburg. Speer arrived there the previous evening and accepted Todt&#x27;s offer to fly with him to Berlin. Speer cancelled some hours before take-off because the previous night he had been up late in a meeting with Hitler. Hitler appointed Speer in Todt&#x27;s place. Martin Kitchen, a British historian, says that the choice was not surprising. Speer was loyal to Hitler, and his experience building prisoner of war camps and other structures for the military qualified him for the job. Speer succeeded Todt not only as Reich Minister but in all his other powerful positions, including Inspector General of German Roadways, Inspector General for Water and Energy and Head of the Nazi Party&#x27;s Office of Technology. At the same time, Hitler also appointed Speer as head of the Organisation Todt, a massive, government-controlled construction company. Characteristically Hitler did not give Speer any clear remit; he was left to fight his contemporaries in the regime for power and control. As an example, he wanted to be given power over all armaments issues under Göring&#x27;s Four Year Plan. Göring was reluctant to grant this. However Speer secured Hitler&#x27;s support, and on 1 March 1942, Göring signed a decree naming Speer &quot;General Plenipotentiary for Armament Tasks&quot; in the Four Year Plan. Speer proved to be ambitious, unrelenting and ruthless. Speer set out to gain control not just of armaments production in the army, but in the whole armed forces. It did not immediately dawn on his political rivals that his calls for rationalization and reorganization were hiding his desire to sideline them and take control. By April 1942, Speer had persuaded Göring to create a three-member Central Planning Board within the Four Year Plan, which he used to obtain supreme authority over procurement and allocation of raw materials and scheduling of production in order to consolidate German war production in a single agency. 

Speer was fêted at the time, and in the post-war era, for performing an &quot;armaments miracle&quot; in which German war production dramatically increased. This miracle was brought to a halt in the summer of 1943 by, among other factors, the first sustained Allied bombing. Other factors probably contributed to the increase more than Speer himself. Germany&#x27;s armaments production had already begun to result in increases under his predecessor, Todt. Naval armaments were not under Speer&#x27;s supervision until October 1943, nor the Luftwaffe&#x27;s armaments until June of the following year. Yet each showed comparable increases in production despite not being under Speer&#x27;s control. Another factor that produced the boom in ammunition was the policy of allocating more coal to the steel industry. Production of every type of weapon peaked in June and July 1944, but there was now a severe shortage of fuel. After August 1944, oil from the Romanian fields was no longer available. Oil production became so low that any possibility of offensive action became impossible and weaponry lay idle.

As Minister of Armaments, Speer was responsible for supplying weapons to the army. With Hitler&#x27;s full agreement, he decided to prioritize tank production, and he was given unrivaled power to ensure success. Hitler was closely involved with the design of the tanks, but kept changing his mind about the specifications. This delayed the program, and Speer was unable to remedy the situation. In consequence, despite tank production having the highest priority, relatively little of the armaments budget was spent on it. This led to a significant German Army failure at the Battle of Prokhorovka, a major turning point on the Eastern Front against the Soviet Red Army.

As head of Organisation Todt, Speer was directly involved in the construction and alteration of concentration camps. He agreed to expand Auschwitz and some other camps, allocating 13.7 million Reichsmarks for the work to be carried out. This allowed an extra 300 huts to be built at Auschwitz, increasing the total human capacity to 132,000. Included in the building works was material to build gas chambers, crematoria and morgues. The SS called this &quot;Professor Speer&#x27;s Special Programme&quot;.

Speer realized that with six million workers drafted into the armed forces, there was a labor shortage in the war economy, and not enough workers for his factories. In response, Hitler appointed Fritz Sauckel as a &quot;manpower dictator&quot; to obtain new workers. Speer and Sauckel cooperated closely to meet Speer&#x27;s labor demands. Hitler gave Sauckel a free hand to obtain labor, something that delighted Speer, who had requested 1,000,000 &quot;voluntary&quot; laborers to meet the need for armament workers. Sauckel had whole villages in France, Holland and Belgium forcibly rounded up and shipped to Speer&#x27;s factories. Sauckel obtained new workers often using the most brutal methods. In occupied areas of the Soviet Union, that had been subject to partisan action, civilian men and women were rounded up en masse and sent to work forcibly in Germany. By April 1943, Sauckel had supplied 1,568,801 &quot;voluntary&quot; laborers, forced laborers, prisoners of war and concentration camp prisoners to Speer for use in his armaments factories. It was for the maltreatment of these people, that Speer was principally convicted at the Nuremberg trials.

===Consolidation of arms production===

Following his appointment as Minister of Armaments, Speer was in control of armaments production solely for the Army. He coveted control of the production of armaments for the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; and &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; as well. He set about extending his power and influence with unexpected ambition. His close relationship with Hitler provided him with political protection, and he was able to outwit and outmaneuver his rivals in the regime. Hitler&#x27;s cabinet was dismayed at his tactics, but, regardless, he was able to accumulate new responsibilities and more power. By July 1943, he had gained control of armaments production for the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; and &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;. In August 1943, he took control of most of the Ministry of Economics, to become, in Admiral Dönitz&#x27;s words, &quot;Europe&#x27;s economic dictator&quot;. His formal title was changed on 2 September 1943, to &quot;Reich Minister for Armaments and War Production&quot;. He had become one of the most powerful people in Nazi Germany.

Speer and his hand-picked director of submarine construction believed that the shipbuilding industry was being held back by outdated methods, and revolutionary new approaches imposed by outsiders would dramatically improve output. This belief proved incorrect, and Speer and Merker&#x27;s attempt to build the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;″s new generation of submarines, the Type XXI and Type XXIII, as prefabricated sections at different facilities rather than at single dockyards contributed to the failure of this strategically important program. The designs were rushed into production, but the completed submarines were crippled by construction flaws. While dozens of submarines were built, few ever entered service.

In December 1943, Speer visited Organisation Todt workers in Lapland, where he seriously damaged his knee and was incapacitated for several months. He was under the dubious care of Professor Karl Gebhardt at a medical clinic called Hohenlychen where patients &quot;mysteriously failed to survive&quot;. In mid-January 1944, Speer had a lung embolism and fell seriously ill. Concerned about retaining power, he did not appoint a deputy and continued to direct work of the Armaments Ministry from his bedside. Speer&#x27;s illness coincided with the Allied &quot;Big Week&quot;, a series of bombing raids on the German aircraft factories that were a devastating blow to aircraft production. His political rivals used the opportunity to undermine his authority and damage his reputation with Hitler. He lost Hitler&#x27;s unconditional support and began to lose power.
In response to the Allied Big Week, Adolf Hitler authorized the creation of a Fighter Staff committee. Its aim was to ensure the preservation and growth of fighter aircraft production. The task force was established by 1 March 1944, orders of Speer, with support from Erhard Milch of the Reich Aviation Ministry. Production of German fighter aircraft more than doubled between 1943 and 1944. The growth, however, consisted in large part of models that were becoming obsolescent and proved easy prey for Allied aircraft. On 1 August 1944, Speer merged the Fighter Staff into a newly formed Armament Staff committee.

The Fighter Staff committee was instrumental in bringing about the increased exploitation of slave labor in the war economy. The SS provided 64,000 prisoners for 20 separate projects from various concentration camps including Mittelbau-Dora. Prisoners worked for Junkers, Messerschmitt, Henschel and BMW, among others. To increase production, Speer introduced a system of punishments for his workforce. Those who feigned illness, slacked off, sabotaged production or tried to escape were denied food or sent to concentration camps. In 1944, this became endemic; over half a million workers were arrested. By this time, 140,000 people were working in Speer&#x27;s underground factories. These factories were death-traps; discipline was brutal, with regular executions. There were so many corpses at the Dora underground factory, for example, that the crematorium was overwhelmed. Speer&#x27;s own staff described the conditions there as &quot;hell&quot;.

The largest technological advance under Speer&#x27;s command came through the rocket program. It began in 1932 but had not supplied any weaponry. Speer enthusiastically supported the program and in March 1942 made an order for A4 rockets, the predecessor of the world&#x27;s first ballistic missile, the V-2 rocket. The rockets were researched at a facility in Peenemünde along with the V-1 flying bomb. The V-2&#x27;s first target was Paris on 8 September 1944. The program while advanced proved to be an impediment to the war economy. The large capital investment was not repaid in military effectiveness. The rockets were built at an underground factory at Mittelwerk. Labor to build the A4 rockets came from the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp. Of the 60,000 people who ended up at the camp 20,000 died, due to the appalling conditions.

On 14 April 1944, Speer lost control of Organisation Todt to his deputy, Franz Xaver Dorsch. He opposed the assassination attempt against Hitler on 20 July 1944. He was not involved in the plot, and played a minor role in the regime&#x27;s efforts to regain control over Berlin after Hitler survived. After the plot Speer&#x27;s rivals attacked some of his closest allies and his management system fell out of favor with radicals in the party. He lost yet more authority.

===Defeat of Nazi Germany===

Losses of territory and a dramatic expansion of the Allied strategic bombing campaign caused the collapse of the German economy from late 1944. Air attacks on the transport network were particularly effective, as they cut the main centres of production off from essential coal supplies. In January 1945, Speer told Goebbels that armaments production could be sustained for at least a year. However, he concluded that the war was lost after Soviet forces captured the important Silesian industrial region later that month. Nevertheless, Speer believed that Germany should continue the war for as long as possible with the goal of winning better conditions from the Allies than the unconditional surrender they insisted upon. During January and February, Speer claimed that his ministry would deliver &quot;decisive weapons&quot; and a large increase in armaments production which would &quot;bring about a dramatic change on the battlefield&quot;. Speer gained control over the railways in February, and asked Heinrich Himmler to supply concentration camp prisoners to work on their repair.

By mid-March, Speer had accepted that Germany&#x27;s economy would collapse within the next eight weeks. While he sought to frustrate directives to destroy industrial facilities in areas at risk of capture, so that they could be used after the war, he still supported the war&#x27;s continuation. Speer provided Hitler with a memorandum on 15 March, which detailed Germany&#x27;s dire economic situation and sought approval to cease demolitions of infrastructure. Three days later, he also proposed to Hitler that Germany&#x27;s remaining military resources be concentrated along the Rhine and Vistula rivers in an attempt to prolong the fighting. This ignored military realities, as the German armed forces were unable to match the Allies&#x27; firepower and were facing total defeat. Hitler rejected Speer&#x27;s proposal to cease demolitions. Instead, he issued the &quot;Nero Decree&quot; on 19 March, which called for the destruction of all infrastructure as the army retreated. Speer was appalled by this order, and persuaded several key military and political leaders to ignore it. During a meeting with Speer on 28/29 March, Hitler rescinded the decree and gave him authority over demolitions. Speer ended them, though the army continued to blow up bridges.

By April, little was left of the armaments industry, and Speer had few official duties. Speer visited the &quot;Führerbunker&quot; on 22 April for the last time. He met Hitler and toured the damaged Chancellery before leaving Berlin to return to Hamburg. Speer would later claim in his memoirs that during this visit he &quot;confessed to Hitler [...] that he was disobeying his &#x27;scorched-earth&#x27; policy&quot;, an assertion which has been described as &quot;pure invention&quot; by historian Richard J. Evans. On 29 April, the day before committing suicide, Hitler dictated a final political testament which dropped Speer from the successor government. Speer was to be replaced by his subordinate, Karl-Otto Saur. Speer was disappointed that Hitler had not selected him as his successor. After Hitler&#x27;s death, Speer offered his services to Hitler&#x27;s successor, Karl Dönitz. On 2 May, Dönitz asked Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk to form a new government, and discussions went on about the formation of the administration for the next few days. On May 5, Schwerin von Krosigk presented his cabinet (known as the Flensburg government) and Speer was named as Minister of Industry and Production. Speer provided information to the Allies, regarding the effects of the air war, and on a broad range of subjects, beginning on 10 May. On 23 May, two weeks after the surrender of German forces, British troops arrested the members of the Flensburg Government and brought Nazi Germany to a formal end.

==Post-war==
===Nuremberg trial===
Speer was taken to several internment centres for Nazi officials and interrogated. In September 1945, he was told that he would be tried for war crimes, and several days later, he was moved to Nuremberg and incarcerated there. Speer was indicted on four counts: participating in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of crime against peace; planning, initiating and waging wars of aggression and other crimes against peace; war crimes; and crimes against humanity.

The chief United States prosecutor, Robert H. Jackson, of the U.S. Supreme Court said, &quot;Speer joined in planning and executing the program to dragoon prisoners of war and foreign workers into German war industries, which waxed in output while the workers waned in starvation.&quot; Speer&#x27;s attorney, Hans Flächsner, successfully contrasted Speer from other defendants and portrayed him as an artist thrust into political life who had always remained a non-ideologue.

Speer was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity, principally for the use of slave labor and forced labor. He was acquitted on the other two counts. He had claimed that he was unaware of Nazi extermination plans, and the Allies had no proof that he was aware. His claim was revealed to be false in a private correspondence written in 1971 and publicly disclosed in 2007. On 1 October 1946, he was sentenced to 20 years&#x27; imprisonment. While three of the eight judges (two Soviet and American Francis Biddle) advocated the death penalty for Speer, the other judges did not, and a compromise sentence was reached after two days of discussions.

===Imprisonment===
On 18 July 1947, Speer was transferred to Spandau Prison in Berlin to serve his prison term. There he was known as Prisoner Number Five. Speer&#x27;s parents died while he was incarcerated. His father, who died in 1947, despised the Nazis and was silent upon meeting Hitler. His mother died in 1952. As a Nazi Party member, she had greatly enjoyed dining with Hitler. Wolters and longtime Speer secretary Annemarie Kempf, while not permitted direct communication with Speer in Spandau, did what they could to help his family and carry out the requests Speer put in letters to his wife—the only written communication he was officially allowed. Beginning in 1948, Speer had the services of Toni Proost, a sympathetic Dutch orderly, to smuggle mail and his writings.
In 1949, Wolters opened a bank account for Speer and began fundraising among those architects and industrialists who had benefited from Speer&#x27;s activities during the war. Initially, the funds were used only to support Speer&#x27;s family, but increasingly the money was used for other purposes. They paid for Toni Proost to go on holiday, and for bribes to those who might be able to secure Speer&#x27;s release. Once Speer became aware of the existence of the fund, he sent detailed instructions about what to do with the money. Wolters raised a total of DM158,000 for Speer over the final seventeen years of his sentence.

The prisoners were forbidden to write memoirs. Speer was able to have his writings sent to Wolters, however, and they eventually amounted to 20,000 pages. He had completed his memoirs by November 1953, and they became the basis of &quot;Inside the Third Reich&quot;. In &quot;Spandau Diaries&quot;, Speer aimed to present himself as a tragic hero who had made a Faustian bargain for which he endured a harsh prison sentence.

Much of Speer&#x27;s energy was dedicated to keeping fit, both physically and mentally, during his long confinement. Spandau had a large enclosed yard where inmates were allocated plots of land for gardening. Speer created an elaborate garden complete with lawns, flower beds, shrubbery, and fruit trees. To make his daily walks around the garden more engaging, Speer embarked on an imaginary trip around the globe. Speer started his “walk” from Berlin and went eastward across the entirety of Eurasia, crossed the Bering Strait into Alaska and then traveled south down the west coast of North America. Carefully measuring distance travelled each day, he mapped distances to real-world geography. He had walked more than , ending his sentence near Guadalajara, Mexico. Speer also read, studied architectural journals, and brushed up on English and French. In his writings, Speer claimed to have finished five thousand books while in prison. His sentence of twenty years amounted to 7,305 days, which only allotted one and a half days per book.

Speer&#x27;s supporters maintained calls for his release. Among those who pledged support for his sentence to be commuted were Charles de Gaulle and US diplomat George Wildman Ball. Willy Brandt was an advocate of his release, putting an end to the de-Nazification proceedings against him, which could have caused his property to be confiscated. Speer&#x27;s efforts for an early release came to naught. The Soviet Union, having demanded a death sentence at trial, was unwilling to entertain a reduced sentence. Speer served a full term and was released at midnight on 1 October 1966.

===Release and later life===
Speer&#x27;s release from prison was a worldwide media event. Reporters and photographers crowded both the street outside Spandau and the lobby of the Hotel Berlin where Speer spent the night. He said little, reserving most comments for a major interview published in &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; in November 1966. Although he stated he hoped to resume an architectural career, his sole project, a collaboration for a brewery, was unsuccessful. Instead, he revised his Spandau writings into two autobiographical books, &quot;Inside the Third Reich&quot; (in German, &quot;Erinnerungen&quot;, or &quot;Reminiscences&quot;) and &quot;&quot;. He later published a work about Himmler and the SS, which has been published in English as &quot;The Slave State: Heinrich Himmler&#x27;s Masterplan for SS Supremacy&quot; or &quot;Infiltration: How Heinrich Himmler Schemed to Build an SS Industrial Empire&quot; (in German, &quot;Der Sklavenstaat - Meine Auseinandersetzung mit der SS&quot;). Speer was aided in shaping the works by Joachim Fest and Wolf Jobst Siedler from the publishing house Ullstein. He found himself unable to re-establish a relationship with his children, even with his son Albert, who had also become an architect. According to Speer&#x27;s daughter Hilde Schramm, &quot;One by one, my sister and brothers gave up. There was no communication.&quot; He provided financial support for his brother Hermann after the war. However, his other brother Ernst died at the Battle of Stalingrad, despite repeated requests from his parents for Speer to repatriate him.

Following his release from Spandau, Speer donated the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, his personal diary, to the German Federal Archives. It had been edited by Wolters and made no mention of the Jews. David Irving discovered discrepancies between the deceptively edited &quot;Chronicle&quot; and independent documents. Speer asked Wolters to destroy the material he had omitted from his donation but Wolters refused and retained an original copy. Wolters&#x27; friendship with Speer deteriorated, and one year before Speer&#x27;s death, Wolters gave Matthias Schmidt access to the unedited &quot;Chronicle&quot;. Schmidt authored the first book highly critical of Speer.

Speer&#x27;s memoirs were a phenomenal success. The public was fascinated by an inside view of the Third Reich and a major war criminal became a popular figure almost overnight. Importantly, he provided an alibi to older Germans who had been Nazis. If Speer, who had been so close to Hitler, had not known the full extent of the crimes of the Nazi regime and had just been &quot;following orders&quot;, then they could tell themselves and others they too had done the same. So great was the need to believe this &quot;Speer myth&quot; that Fest and Siedler were able to strengthen it—even in the face of mounting historical evidence to the contrary.

===Death===

Speer made himself widely available to historians and other enquirers. In October 1973, he made his first trip to Britain, flying to London to be interviewed on the BBC &quot;Midweek&quot; programme. In the same year, he appeared on the television programme &quot;The World at War&quot;. Speer returned to London in 1981 to participate in the BBC &quot;Newsnight&quot; programme. He suffered a stroke and died in London on 1 September.

He had remained married to his wife, but he had formed a relationship with a German woman living in London and was with her at the time of his death. His daughter, Margret Nissen, wrote in her 2005 memoirs that after his release from Spandau he spent all of his time constructing the &quot;Speer Myth&quot;.

==The Speer myth==
===The Good Nazi===
After his release from Spandau, Speer portrayed himself as the &quot;good Nazi&quot;. He was well-educated, middle class, and bourgeois, and could contrast himself with those who, in the popular mind, typified &quot;Bad Nazis&quot;. In his memoirs and interviews, he had distorted the truth and made so many major omissions that his lies became known as &quot;myths&quot;. Speer even invented his own birth&#x27;s circumstances, stating falsely that he was born at midday amid crashes of thunder and bells of the nearby Christ Church, whereas it was between three and five o&#x27;clock, and the church was built only some years after. Speer took his myth-making to a mass media level and his &quot;cunning apologies&quot; were reproduced frequently in post-war Germany. Isabell Trommer writes in her biography of Speer that Fest and Siedler were co-authors of Speer&#x27;s memoirs and co-creators of his myths. In return they were paid handsomely in royalties and other financial inducements. Speer, Siedler and Fest had constructed a masterpiece; the image of the &quot;good Nazi&quot; remained in place for decades, despite historical evidence indicating that it was false.
Speer had carefully constructed an image of himself as an apolitical technocrat who deeply regretted having failed to discover the monstrous crimes of the Third Reich. This construction was accepted almost at face value by historian Hugh Trevor-Roper when investigating the death of Adolf Hitler for British Intelligence and in writing &quot;The Last Days of Hitler&quot;. Trevor-Roper frequently refers to Speer as &quot;a technocrat [who] nourished a technocrat&#x27;s philosophy&quot;, one who cared only for his building projects or his ministerial duties, and who thought that politics was irrelevant, at least until Hitler&#x27;s Nero Decree which Speer, according to his own telling, worked assiduously to counter. Trevor-Roper – who calls Speer an administrative genius whose basic instincts were peaceful and constructive – does take Speer to task, however, for his failure to recognize the immorality of Hitler and Nazism, calling him &quot;the real criminal of Nazi Germany&quot;:

For ten years he sat at the very centre of political power; his keen intelligence diagnosed the nature and observed the mutations of Nazi government and policy; he saw and despised the personalities around him; he heard their outrageous orders and understood their fantastic ambitions; but he did nothing. Supposing politics to be irrelevant, he turned aside and built roads and bridges and factories, while the logical consequences of government by madmen emerged. Ultimately, when their emergence involved the ruin of all his work, Speer accepted the consequences and acted. Then it was too late; Germany had been destroyed.

After Speer&#x27;s death, Matthias Schmidt published a book that demonstrated that Speer had ordered the eviction of Jews from their Berlin homes. By 1999, historians had amply demonstrated that Speer had lied extensively. Even so, public perceptions of Speer did not change substantially until Heinrich Breloer aired the biographical film &quot;Speer und Er&quot; on television in 2004. The film began a process of demystification and critical reappraisal of Speer. Adam Tooze in his book &quot;The Wages of Destruction&quot; said Speer had manoeuvred himself through the ranks of the regime skillfully and ruthlessly and that the idea he was a technocrat blindly carrying out orders was &quot;absurd&quot;. Trommer said Speer was not an apolitical technocrat; instead, he was, in reality, one of the most powerful and unscrupulous leaders in the entire Nazi regime. Kitchen said Speer had deceived the Nuremberg Tribunal and post-war Germany. Brechtken said that if Speer&#x27;s extensive involvement in the Holocaust had been known at the time of his trial he would have been sentenced to death.

The image of the &quot;good Nazi&quot; was supported by numerous Speer myths. In addition to the myth that he was an apolitical technocrat, he claimed he did not have full knowledge of the Holocaust or the persecution of the Jews. Another myth posits that Speer revolutionized the German war machine after his appointment as Minister of Armaments. He was credited with a dramatic increase in the shipment of arms that was widely reported as keeping Germany in the war. Another myth centered around a nonexistent plan to assassinate Hitler with poisonous gas. The idea for this myth came to him after he recalled the panic when car fumes came through an air ventilation system. He fabricated the additional details. Brechtken wrote that Speer&#x27;s most brazen lie was fabricated during an interview with a French journalist in 1952. The journalist described an invented scenario in which Speer had refused Hitler&#x27;s orders and Hitler had left with tears in his eyes. Speer liked the scenario so much that he included it in his memoirs. The journalist had unwittingly collaborated in creating one of his myths.

Speer also sought to portray himself as an opponent of Hitler&#x27;s leadership. Despite his opposition to the 20 July plot, he falsely claimed in his memoirs to have been sympathetic to the plotters. He maintained Hitler was cool towards him for the remainder of his life after learning they had included him on a list of potential ministers. This formed a key element of the myths Speer encouraged. Speer also falsely claimed that he had realised the war was lost at an early stage, and thereafter worked to preserve the resources needed for the civilian population&#x27;s survival. In reality, Speer had sought to prolong the war until further resistance was impossible, thus contributing to the large number of deaths and the extensive destruction Germany suffered during the final months of the war.

===Denial of responsibility===

Speer maintained at the Nuremberg trials and in his memoirs that he had no direct knowledge of the Holocaust. He admitted only to being uncomfortable around Jews in the published version of the &quot;Spandau Diaries&quot;. In his final statement at Nuremberg, Speer gave the impression of apologizing, although he did not directly admit any personal guilt and the only victim he mentioned was the German people. Historian Martin Kitchen states that Speer was actually &quot;fully aware of what had happened to the Jews&quot; and was &quot;intimately involved in the &#x27;Final Solution. Brechtken said Speer only admitted to a generalized responsibility for the Holocaust to hide his direct and actual responsibility. Speer was photographed with slave laborers at Mauthausen concentration camp during a visit on 31 March 1943; he also visited Gusen concentration camp. Although survivor Francisco Boix testified at the Nuremberg trials about Speer&#x27;s visit, Taylor writes that, had the photo been available, he would have been hanged. In 2005, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that documents had surfaced indicating that Speer had approved the allocation of materials for the expansion of Auschwitz concentration camp after two of his assistants inspected the facility on a day when almost a thousand Jews were massacred. Heinrich Breloer, discussing the construction of Auschwitz, said Speer was not just a cog in the work—he was the &quot;terror itself&quot;.

Speer did not deny being present at the Posen speeches to Nazi leaders at a conference in Posen (Poznań) on 6 October 1943, but claimed to have left the auditorium before Himmler said during his speech: &quot;The grave decision had to be taken to cause this people to vanish from the earth&quot;, and later, &quot;The Jews must be exterminated&quot;. Speer is mentioned several times in the speech, and Himmler addresses him directly. In 2007, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that a letter from Speer dated 23 December 1971, had been found in a collection of his correspondence with Hélène Jeanty, the widow of a Belgian resistance fighter. In the letter, Speer says, &quot;There is no doubt—I was present as Himmler announced on October 6, 1943, that all Jews would be killed.&quot;

===Armaments miracle===

Speer was credited with an &quot;armaments miracle&quot;. During the winter of 1941–42, in the light of Germany&#x27;s disastrous defeat in the Battle of Moscow, the German leadership including Friedrich Fromm, Georg Thomas and Fritz Todt had come to the conclusion that the war could not be won. The rational position to adopt was to seek a political solution that would end the war without defeat. Speer in response used his propaganda expertise to display a new dynamism of the war economy. He produced spectacular statistics, claiming a sixfold increase in munitions production, a fourfold increase in artillery production, and he sent further propaganda to the newsreels of the country. He was able to curtail the discussion that the war should be ended.

The armaments &quot;miracle&quot; was a myth; Speer had used statistical manipulation to support his claims. The production of armaments did rise; however, this was due to the normal causes of reorganization before Speer came to office, the relentless mobilization of slave labor and a deliberate reduction in the quality of output to favor quantity. By July 1943 Speer&#x27;s armaments propaganda became irrelevant because a catalogue of dramatic defeats on the battlefield meant the prospect of losing the war could no longer be hidden from the German public.

==Architectural legacy==
Little remains of Speer&#x27;s personal architectural works, other than the plans and photographs. No buildings designed by Speer during the Nazi era are extant in Berlin, other than the four entrance pavilions and underpasses leading to the Victory Column, or Siegessäule, and the &quot;Schwerbelastungskörper&quot;, a heavy load-bearing body built around 1941. The concrete cylinder, high, was used to measure ground subsidence as part of feasibility studies for a massive triumphal arch and other large structures planned within Hitler&#x27;s post-war renewal project for the city of Berlin as the world capital Germania. The cylinder is now a protected landmark and is open to the public. The tribune of the &quot;Zeppelinfeld&quot; stadium in Nuremberg, though partly demolished, can also be seen.

During the war, the Speer-designed New Reich Chancellery was largely destroyed by air raids and in the Battle of Berlin. The exterior walls survived, but they were eventually dismantled by the Soviets. Unsubstantiated rumors have claimed that the remains were used for other building projects such as the Humboldt University, Mohrenstraße metro station and Soviet war memorials in Berlin.

<text>Asteraceae () is a large family of flowering plants that consists of over 32,000 known species in over 1,900 genera within the order Asterales. The number of species in Asteraceae is rivaled only by the Orchidaceae, and which is the larger family is unclear as the quantity of extant species in each family is unknown. The Asteraceae were first described in the year 1740 and given the original name Compositae. The family is commonly known as the aster, daisy, composite, or sunflower family. 

Most species of Asteraceae are herbaceous plants, and may be annual, biennial, or perennial, but there are also shrubs, vines, and trees. The family has a widespread distribution, from subpolar to tropical regions, in a wide variety of habitats. Most occur in hot desert and cold or hot semi-desert climates, and they are found on every continent but Antarctica. Their common primary characteristic is compound flower heads, technically known as capitula, consisting of sometimes hundreds of tiny individual florets enclosed by a whorl of protective involucral bracts.

The oldest known fossils are pollen grains from the Late Cretaceous (Campanian to Maastrichtian) of Antarctica, dated to million years ago (mya). It is estimated that the crown group of Asteraceae evolved at least 85.9 mya (Late Cretaceous, Santonian) with a stem node age of 88–89 mya (Late Cretaceous, Coniacian).

Asteraceae is an economically important family, providing food staples, garden plants, and herbal medicines. Species outside of their native ranges can become weedy or invasive.

==Description==
Members of the Asteraceae are mostly herbaceous plants, but some shrubs, vines, and trees (such as &quot;Lachanodes arborea&quot;) do exist. Asteraceae species are generally easy to distinguish from other plants because of their unique inflorescence and other shared characteristics, such as the joined anthers of the stamens. Nonetheless, determining genera and species of some groups such as &quot;Hieracium&quot; is notoriously difficult (see &quot;damned yellow composite&quot; for example).

===Roots===
Members of the family Asteraceae generally produce taproots, but sometimes they possess fibrous root systems. Some species have underground stems in the form of caudices or rhizomes. These can be fleshy or woody depending on the species.

===Stems===
The stems are herbaceous, aerial, branched, and cylindrical with glandular hairs, usually erect, but can be prostrate to ascending. The stems can contain secretory canals with resin, or latex, which is particularly common among the Cichorioideae.

===Leaves===
Leaves can be alternate, opposite, or whorled. They may be simple, but are often deeply lobed or otherwise incised, often conduplicate or revolute. The margins also can be entire or toothed. Resin or latex can also be present in the leaves.

===Inflorescences===
Nearly all Asteraceae bear their flowers in dense flower heads called &quot;capitula&quot;. They are surrounded by involucral bracts, and when viewed from a distance, each capitulum may appear to be a single flower. Enlarged outer (peripheral) flowers in the capitulum may resemble petals, and the involucral bracts may look like a calyx. Notable exceptions include &quot;Hecastocleis shockleyi&quot; (the only species in the subfamily Hecastocleidoideae) and the species of the genus &quot;Corymbium&quot; (the only genus in the subfamily Corymbioideae), which have one-flowered bisexual capitulas, &quot;Gundelia&quot; with one-flowered unisexual capitulas, and Gymnarrhena micrantha with one-flowered female capitulas and few flowered male capitulas.

In plants of the Asteraceae, what appears to be a single &quot;daisy&quot;-type flower is actually a composite of several much smaller flowers, known as the &quot;capitulum&quot; or &quot;head&quot;. By visually presenting as a single flower, the capitulum functions in attracting pollinators, in the same manner that other &quot;showy&quot; flowering plants in numerous other, older, plant families have evolved to attract pollinators. The previous name for the family, &quot;Compositae&quot;, reflects the fact that what appears to be a single floral entity is in fact a &quot;composite&quot; of much smaller flowers.

The &quot;petals&quot; or &quot;sunrays&quot; in an &quot;asteraceous&quot; head are in fact individual strap-shaped flowers called &quot;ray flowers&quot; or &quot;ray florets&quot;, and the &quot;sun disk&quot; is made up of smaller, radially symmetric, individual flowers called &quot;disc flowers&quot; or &quot;disc florets&quot;. The word &quot;aster&quot; means &quot;star&quot; in Greek, referring to the appearance of most family members as a &quot;celestial body with rays&quot;.
The capitulum, which often appears to be a single flower, is often referred to as a &quot;head&quot;. In some species, the entire head is able to pivot its floral stem in the course of the day to track the sun (like a &quot;smart&quot; solar panel), thus maximizing the reflectivity of the entire floral unit and further attracting flying pollinators.

Nearest to the flower stem lie a series of small, usually green, scale-like bracts. These are known as &quot;phyllaries&quot;; collectively, they form the involucre, which serves to protect the immature head of florets during its development. The individual florets are arranged atop a dome-like structure called the &quot;receptacle&quot;.

The individual florets in a head consist, developmentally, of five fused petals (rarely four); instead of sepals, they have threadlike, hairy, or bristly structures, known collectively as a &quot;pappus&quot;, (plural &quot;pappi&quot;). The pappus surrounds the ovary and can, when mature and attached to a seed, adhere to animal fur or be carried by air currents, aiding in seed dispersal. The whitish, fluffy head of a dandelion, commonly blown on by children, consists of numerous seeds resting on the receptacle, each seed attached to its pappus. The pappi provide a parachute-like structure to help the seed travel from its point of origin to a more hospitable site.

A &quot;ray flower&quot; is a two- or three-lobed, strap-shaped, individual flower, found in the head of most members of the Asteraceae. The corolla of the ray flower may have two tiny, vestigial teeth, opposite to the three-lobed strap, or tongue, indicating its evolution by fusion from an ancestral, five-part corolla. In some species, the 3:2 arrangement is reversed, with two lobes, and zero or three tiny teeth visible opposite the tongue.

A &quot;ligulate flower&quot; is a five-lobed, strap-shaped, individual flower found in the heads of certain other asteraceous species. A &quot;ligule&quot; is the strap-shaped tongue of the corolla of either a ray flower or of a ligulate flower. A &quot;disk flower&quot; (or &quot;disc flower&quot;) is a radially symmetric individual flower in the head, which is ringed by the ray flowers when both are present. In some species, ray flowers may be arranged around the disc in irregular symmetry, or with a weakly bilaterally symmetric arrangement.

== Variations ==
A &quot;radiate head&quot; has disc flowers surrounded by ray flowers. A &quot;ligulate head&quot; has all ligulate flowers and no disc flowers. When an Asteraceae flower head has only disc flowers that are either sterile, male, or bisexual (but not female and fertile), it is a &quot;discoid head&quot;.

&quot;Disciform heads&quot; possess only disc flowers in their heads, but may produce two different sex types (male or female) within their disciform head.

Some other species produce two different head types: &quot;staminate&quot; (all-male), or &quot;pistillate&quot; (all-female). In a few unusual species, the &quot;head&quot; will consist of one single disc flower; alternatively, a few species will produce both single-flowered female heads, along with multi-flowered male heads, in their &quot;pollination strategy&quot;.

=== Floral structures ===
The distinguishing characteristic of Asteraceae is their inflorescence, a type of specialised, composite flower head or &quot;pseudanthium&quot;, technically called a calathium or &quot;capitulum&quot;, that may look superficially like a single flower. The &quot;capitulum&quot; is a contracted raceme composed of numerous individual sessile flowers, called &quot;florets&quot;, all sharing the same receptacle.

A set of bracts forms an involucre surrounding the base of the capitulum. These are called &quot;phyllaries&quot;, or &quot;involucral bracts&quot;. They may simulate the sepals of the pseudanthium. These are mostly herbaceous but can also be brightly coloured (e.g. &quot;Helichrysum&quot;) or have a scarious (dry and membranous) texture. The phyllaries can be free or fused, and arranged in one to many rows, overlapping like the tiles of a roof (&quot;imbricate&quot;) or not (this variation is important in identification of tribes and genera).

Each floret may be subtended by a bract, called a &quot;palea&quot; or &quot;receptacular bract&quot;. These bracts are often called &quot;chaff&quot;. The presence or absence of these bracts, their distribution on the receptacle, and their size and shape are all important diagnostic characteristics for genera and tribes.

The florets have five petals fused at the base to form a corolla tube and they may be either actinomorphic or zygomorphic. &quot;Disc florets&quot; are usually actinomorphic, with five petal lips on the rim of the corolla tube. The petal lips may be either very short, or long, in which case they form deeply lobed petals. The latter is the only kind of floret in the Carduoideae, while the first kind is more widespread. &quot;Ray florets&quot; are always highly zygomorphic and are characterised by the presence of a &quot;ligule&quot;, a strap-shaped structure on the edge of the corolla tube consisting of fused petals. In the Asteroideae and other minor subfamilies these are usually borne only on florets at the circumference of the capitulum and have a 3+2 scheme – above the fused corolla tube, three very long fused petals form the ligule, with the other two petals being inconspicuously small. The Cichorioideae has only ray florets, with a 5+0 scheme – all five petals form the ligule. A 4+1 scheme is found in the Barnadesioideae. The tip of the ligule is often divided into teeth, each one representing a petal. Some marginal florets may have no petals at all (filiform floret).

The calyx of the florets may be absent, but when present is always modified into a pappus of two or more teeth, scales or bristles and this is often involved in the dispersion of the seeds. As with the bracts, the nature of the pappus is an important diagnostic feature.

There are usually four or five stamens. The filaments are fused to the corolla, while the anthers are generally connate (&quot;syngenesious&quot; anthers), thus forming a sort of tube around the style (&quot;theca&quot;). They commonly have basal and/or apical appendages. Pollen is released inside the tube and is collected around the growing style, and then, as the style elongates, is pushed out of the tube (&quot;nüdelspritze&quot;).

The pistil consists of two connate carpels. The style has two lobes. Stigmatic tissue may be located in the interior surface or form two lateral lines. The ovary is inferior and has only one ovule, with basal placentation.

=== Fruits and seeds ===
In members of the Asteraceae the fruit is achene-like, and is called a &quot;cypsela&quot; (plural &quot;cypselae&quot;). Although there are two fused carpels, there is only one locule, and only one seed per fruit is formed. It may sometimes be winged or spiny because the pappus, which is derived from calyx tissue often remains on the fruit (for example in dandelion). In some species, however, the pappus falls off (for example in &quot;Helianthus&quot;). Cypsela morphology is often used to help determine plant relationships at the genus and species level. The mature seeds usually have little endosperm or none.

=== Pollen ===
The pollen of composites is typically echinolophate, a morphological term meaning &quot;with elaborate systems of ridges and spines dispersed around and between the apertures.&quot;

=== Metabolites ===
In Asteraceae, the energy store is generally in the form of inulin rather than starch. They produce iso/chlorogenic acid, sesquiterpene lactones, pentacyclic triterpene alcohols, various alkaloids, acetylenes (cyclic, aromatic, with vinyl end groups), tannins. They have terpenoid essential oils that never contain iridoids.

Asteraceae produce secondary metabolites, such as flavonoids and terpenoids. Some of these molecules can inhibit protozoan parasites such as &quot;Plasmodium&quot;, &quot;Trypanosoma&quot;, &quot;Leishmania&quot; and parasitic intestinal worms, and thus have potential in medicine.

== Taxonomy ==

===History===
Compositae, the original name for Asteraceae, were first described in 1740 by Dutch botanist Adriaan van Royen. Traditionally, two subfamilies were recognised: Asteroideae (or Tubuliflorae) and Cichorioideae (or Liguliflorae). The latter has been shown to be extensively paraphyletic, and has now been divided into 12 subfamilies, but the former still stands. The study of this family is known as synantherology.

===Phylogeny===
The phylogenetic tree of subfamilies presented below is based on Panero &amp; Funk (2002) updated in 2014, and now also includes the monotypic Famatinanthoideae.
The diamond (♦) denotes a very poorly supported node (&lt;50% bootstrap support), the dot (•) a poorly supported node (&lt;80%).

The family includes over 32,000 currently accepted species, in over 1,900 genera (list) in 13 subfamilies. The number of species in the family Asteraceae is rivaled only by Orchidaceae. Which is the larger family is unclear, because of the uncertainty about how many extant species each family includes. The four subfamilies Asteroideae, Cichorioideae, Carduoideae and Mutisioideae contain 99% of the species diversity of the whole family (approximately 70%, 14%, 11% and 3% respectively).

Because of the morphological complexity exhibited by this family, agreeing on generic circumscriptions has often been difficult for taxonomists. As a result, several of these genera have required multiple revisions.

==== Paleontology and evolutionary processes ====
The oldest known fossils of members of Asteraceae are pollen grains from the Late Cretaceous of Antarctica, dated to ~76–66 mya (Campanian to Maastrichtian) and assigned to the extant genus &quot;Dasyphyllum&quot;. Barreda, &quot;et al.&quot; (2015) estimated that the crown group of Asteraceae evolved at least 85.9 mya (Late Cretaceous, Santonian) with a stem node age of 88–89 mya (Late Cretaceous, Coniacian).

It is not known whether the precise cause of their great success was the development of the highly specialised capitulum, their ability to store energy as fructans (mainly inulin), which is an advantage in relatively dry zones, or some combination of these and possibly other factors. Heterocarpy, or the ability to produce different fruit morphs, has evolved and is common in Asteraceae. It allows seeds to be dispersed over varying distances and each is adapted to different environments, increasing chances of survival.

=== Etymology and pronunciation ===
The original name Compositae is still valid under the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants. It refers to the &quot;composite&quot; nature of the capitula, which consist of a few or many individual flowers.

The alternative (as it came later) name Asteraceae () comes to international scientific vocabulary from Neo-Latin, from &quot;Aster&quot;, the type genus, + &quot;&quot;, a standardized suffix for plant family names in modern taxonomy. This genus name comes from the Classical Latin word , &quot;star&quot;, which came from Ancient Greek (), &quot;star&quot;. It refers to the star-like form of the inflorescence.

The vernacular name &quot;daisy&quot;, widely applied to members of this family, is derived from the Old English name of the daisy (&quot;Bellis perennis&quot;): , meaning &quot;day&#x27;s eye&quot;. This is because the petals open at dawn and close at dusk.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Asteraceae species have a widespread distribution, from subpolar to tropical regions in a wide variety of habitats. Most occur in hot desert and cold or hot semi-desert climates, and they are found on every continent but Antarctica. They are especially numerous in tropical and subtropical regions (notably Central America, eastern Brazil, the Mediterranean, the Levant, southern Africa, central Asia, and southwestern China). The largest proportion of the species occur in the arid and semi-arid regions of subtropical and lower temperate latitudes. The Asteraceae family comprises 10% of all flowering plant species.

== Ecology ==
Asteraceae are especially common in open and dry environments. Many members of Asteraceae are pollinated by insects, which explains their value in attracting beneficial insects, but anemophily is also present (e.g. &quot;Ambrosia&quot;, &quot;Artemisia&quot;). There are many apomictic species in the family.

Seeds are ordinarily dispersed intact with the fruiting body, the cypsela. &quot;Anemochory&quot; (wind dispersal) is common, assisted by a hairy pappus. &quot;Epizoochory&quot; is another common method, in which the dispersal unit, a single cypsela (e.g. &quot;Bidens&quot;) or entire capitulum (e.g. &quot;Arctium&quot;) has hooks, spines or some structure to attach to the fur or plumage (or even clothes, as in the photo) of an animal just to fall off later far from its mother plant.

Some members of Asteraceae are economically important as weeds. Notable in the United States are &quot;Senecio jacobaea&quot; (ragwort), &quot;Senecio vulgaris&quot; (groundsel), and &quot;Taraxacum&quot; (dandelion). Some are invasive species in particular regions, often having been introduced by human agency. Examples include various tumbleweeds, &quot;Bidens&quot;, ragweeds, thistles, and dandelion. Dandelion was introduced into North America by European settlers who used the young leaves as a salad green. A number of species are toxic to grazing animals.

== Uses ==

Asteraceae is an economically important family, providing products such as cooking oils, leaf vegetables like lettuce, sunflower seeds, artichokes, sweetening agents, coffee substitutes and herbal teas. Several genera are of horticultural importance, including pot marigold (&quot;Calendula officinalis&quot;), &quot;Echinacea&quot; (coneflowers), various daisies, fleabane, chrysanthemums, dahlias, zinnias, and heleniums. Asteraceae are important in herbal medicine, including &quot;Grindelia&quot;, yarrow, and many others.

Commercially important plants in Asteraceae include the food crops &quot;Lactuca sativa&quot; (lettuce), &quot;Cichorium&quot; (chicory), &quot;Cynara scolymus&quot; (globe artichoke), &quot;Helianthus annuus&quot; (sunflower), &quot;Smallanthus sonchifolius&quot; (yacón), &quot;Carthamus tinctorius&quot; (safflower) and &quot;Helianthus tuberosus&quot; (Jerusalem artichoke).

Plants are used as herbs and in herbal teas and other beverages. Chamomile, for example, comes from two different species: the annual &quot;Matricaria chamomilla&quot; (German chamomile) and the perennial &quot;Chamaemelum nobile&quot; (Roman chamomile). &quot;Calendula&quot; (known as pot marigold) is grown commercially for herbal teas and potpourri. &quot;Echinacea&quot; is used as a medicinal tea. The wormwood genus &quot;Artemisia&quot; includes absinthe (&quot;A. absinthium&quot;) and tarragon (&quot;A. dracunculus&quot;). Winter tarragon (&quot;Tagetes lucida&quot;), is commonly grown and used as a tarragon substitute in climates where tarragon will not survive.

Many members of the family are grown as ornamental plants for their flowers, and some are important ornamental crops for the cut flower industry. Some examples are &quot;Chrysanthemum&quot;, &quot;Gerbera&quot;, &quot;Calendula&quot;, &quot;Dendranthema&quot;, &quot;Argyranthemum&quot;, &quot;Dahlia&quot;, &quot;Tagetes&quot;, &quot;Zinnia&quot;, and many others.

Many species of this family possess medicinal properties and are used as traditional antiparasitic medicine.

Members of the family are also commonly featured in medical and phytochemical journals because the sesquiterpene lactone compounds contained within them are an important cause of allergic contact dermatitis. Allergy to these compounds is the leading cause of allergic contact dermatitis in florists in the US. Pollen from ragweed &quot;Ambrosia&quot; is among the main causes of so-called hay fever in the United States.

Asteraceae are also used for some industrial purposes. French Marigold (&quot;Tagetes patula&quot;) is common in commercial poultry feeds and its oil is extracted for uses in cola and the cigarette industry. The genera &quot;Chrysanthemum&quot;, &quot;Pulicaria&quot;, &quot;Tagetes&quot;, and &quot;Tanacetum&quot; contain species with useful insecticidal properties. &quot;Parthenium argentatum&quot; (guayule) is a source of hypoallergenic latex.

Several members of the family are copious nectar producers and are useful for evaluating pollinator populations during their bloom. &quot;Centaurea&quot; (knapweed), &quot;Helianthus annuus&quot; (domestic sunflower), and some species of &quot;Solidago&quot; (goldenrod) are major &quot;honey plants&quot; for beekeepers. &quot;Solidago&quot; produces relatively high protein pollen, which helps honey bees over winter.

<text>Apiaceae () or Umbelliferae is a family of mostly aromatic flowering plants named after the type genus &quot;Apium,&quot; and commonly known as the celery, carrot or parsley family, or simply as umbellifers. It is the 16th-largest family of flowering plants, with more than 3,800 species in about 446 genera, including such well-known, and economically important plants as ajwain, angelica, anise, asafoetida, caraway, carrot, celery, chervil, coriander, cumin, dill, fennel, lovage, cow parsley, parsley, parsnip and sea holly, as well as silphium, a plant whose exact identity is unclear and which may be extinct.

The family Apiaceae includes a significant number of phototoxic species, such as giant hogweed, and a smaller number of highly poisonous species, such as poison hemlock, water hemlock, spotted cowbane, fool&#x27;s parsley, and various species of water dropwort.

== Description ==

Most Apiaceae are annual, biennial or perennial herbs (frequently with the leaves aggregated toward the base), though a minority are woody shrubs or small trees such as &quot;Bupleurum fruticosum&quot;. Their leaves are of variable size, and alternately arranged, or with the upper leaves becoming nearly opposite. The leaves may be petiolate or sessile. There are no stipules but the petioles are frequently sheathing, and the leaves may be perfoliate. The leaf blade is usually dissected, ternate, or pinnatifid, but simple, and entire in some genera, e.g. &quot;Bupleurum&quot;. Commonly, their leaves emit a marked smell when crushed, aromatic to fetid, but absent in some species.

The defining characteristic of this family is the inflorescence, the flowers nearly always aggregated in terminal umbels, that may be simple or more commonly compound, often umbelliform cymes. The flowers are usually perfect (hermaphroditic), and actinomorphic, but there may be zygomorphic flowers at the edge of the umbel, as in carrot (&quot;Daucus carota&quot;) and coriander, with petals of unequal size, the ones pointing outward from the umbel larger than the ones pointing inward. Some are andromonoecious, polygamomonoecious, or even dioecious (as in &quot;Acronema&quot;), with a distinct calyx, and corolla, but the calyx is often highly reduced, to the point of being undetectable in many species, while the corolla can be white, yellow, pink or purple. The flowers are nearly perfectly pentamerous, with five petals and five stamens.
There is often variation in the functionality of the stamens even within a single inflorescence. Some flowers are functionally staminate (where a pistil may be present but has no ovules capable of being fertilized) while others are functionally pistillate (where stamens are present but their anthers do not produce viable pollen). Pollination of one flower by the pollen of a different flower of the same plant (geitonogamy) is common. The gynoecium consists of two carpels fused into a single, bicarpellate pistil with an inferior ovary. Stylopodia support two styles, and secrete nectar, attracting pollinators like flies, mosquitoes, gnats, beetles, moths, and bees. The fruit is a schizocarp consisting of two fused carpels that separate at maturity into two mericarps, each containing a single seed. The fruits of many species are dispersed by wind but others such as those of &quot;Daucus&quot; spp., are covered in bristles, which may be hooked in sanicle &quot;Sanicula europaea&quot; and thus catch in the fur of animals. The seeds have an oily endosperm and often contain essential oils, containing aromatic compounds that are responsible for the flavour of commercially important umbelliferous seed such as anise, cumin and coriander. The shape and details of the ornamentation of the ripe fruits are important for identification to species level.

== Taxonomy ==
Apiaceae was first described by John Lindley in 1836. The name is derived from the type genus &quot;Apium&quot;, which was originally used by Pliny the Elder circa 50 AD for a celery-like plant. The alternative name for the family, Umbelliferae, derives from the inflorescence being generally in the form of a compound umbel. The family was one of the first to be recognized as a distinct group in Jacques Daleschamps&#x27; 1586 &quot;Historia generalis plantarum&quot;. With Robert Morison&#x27;s 1672 &quot;Plantarum umbelliferarum distribution nova&quot; it became the first group of plants for which a systematic study was published.

The family is solidly placed within the Apiales order in the APG III system. It is closely related to Araliaceae and the boundaries between these families remain unclear. Traditionally groups within the family have been delimited largely based on fruit morphology, and the results from this have not been congruent with the more recent molecular phylogenetic analyses. The subfamilial and tribal classification for the family is currently in a state of flux, with many of the groups being found to be grossly paraphyletic or polyphyletic.

===Classification and phylogeny===
Prior to molecular phylogenetic studies, the family was subdivided primarily based on fruit characteristics. Molecular phylogenetic analyses from the mid-1990s onwards have shown that fruit characters evolved in parallel many times, so that using them in classification resulted in units that were not monophyletic. In 2004, it was proposed that Apiaceae should be divided into four subfamilies:
*Apioideae 
*Azorelloideae 
*Mackinlayoideae 
*Saniculoideae 
Apioideae is by far the largest subfamily with about 90% of the genera. Most subsequent studies have supported this division, although leaving some genera unplaced. A 2021 study suggested the relationships shown in the following cladogram.

The &quot;Platysace&quot; clade and the genera &quot;Klotzschia&quot; and &quot;Hermas&quot; fell outside the four subfamilies. It was suggested that they could be accommodated in subfamilies of their own. &quot;Phlyctidocarpa&quot; was formerly placed in the subfamily Apioideae, but if kept there makes Apioideae paraphyletic. It could be placed in an enlarged Saniculoideae, or restored to Apioideae if the latter were expanded to include Saniculoideae.

The subfamilies can be further divided into tribes and clades, with many clades falling outside formally recognized tribes.

=== Genera===

The number of genera accepted by sources varies. , Plants of the World Online (PoWO) accepted 444 genera, while GRIN Taxonomy accepted 462. The PoWO genera are not a subset of those in GRIN; for example, &quot;Haloselinum&quot; is accepted by PoWO but not by GRIN, while &quot;Halosciastrum&quot; is accepted by GRIN but not by PoWO, which treats it as a synonym of &quot;Angelica&quot;. The Angiosperm Phylogeny Website had an &quot;approximate list&quot; of 446 genera.

== Ecology ==
The black swallowtail butterfly, &quot;Papilio polyxenes&quot;, uses the family Apiaceae for food and host plants for oviposition. The 22-spot ladybird is also commonly found eating mildew on these plants.

== Uses ==

Many members of this family are cultivated for various purposes. Parsnip (&quot;Pastinaca sativa&quot;), carrot (&quot;Daucus carota&quot;) and Hamburg parsley (&quot;Petroselinum crispum&quot;) produce tap roots that are large enough to be useful as food. Many species produce essential oils in their leaves or fruits and as a result are flavourful aromatic herbs. Examples are parsley (&quot;Petroselinum crispum&quot;), coriander (&quot;Coriandrum sativum&quot;), culantro, and dill (&quot;Anethum graveolens&quot;). The seeds may be used in cuisine, as with coriander (&quot;Coriandrum sativum&quot;), fennel (&quot;Foeniculum vulgare&quot;), cumin (&quot;Cuminum cyminum&quot;), and caraway (&quot;Carum carvi&quot;).

Other notable cultivated Apiaceae include chervil (&quot;Anthriscus cerefolium&quot;), angelica (&quot;Angelica&quot; spp.), celery (&quot;Apium graveolens&quot;), arracacha (&quot;Arracacia xanthorrhiza&quot;), sea holly (&quot;Eryngium&quot; spp.), asafoetida (&quot;Ferula asafoetida&quot;), galbanum (&quot;Ferula gummosa&quot;), cicely (&quot;Myrrhis odorata&quot;), anise (&quot;Pimpinella anisum&quot;), lovage (&quot;Levisticum officinale&quot;), and hacquetia (&quot;Sanicula epipactis&quot;).

=== Cultivation ===
Generally, all members of this family are best cultivated in the cool-season garden; they may not grow at all if the soils are too warm. Almost every widely cultivated plant of this group is a considered useful as a companion plant. One reason is that the tiny flowers, clustered into umbels, are well suited for ladybugs, parasitic wasps, and predatory flies, which drink nectar when not reproducing. They then prey upon insect pests on nearby plants. Some of the members of this family considered &quot;herbs&quot; produce scents that are believed to mask the odours of nearby plants, thus making them harder for insect pests to find.

=== Other uses ===
The poisonous members of the Apiaceae have been used for a variety of purposes globally. The poisonous &quot;Oenanthe crocata&quot; has been used as an aid in suicides, and arrow poisons have been made from various other family species.

&quot;Daucus carota&quot; has been used as coloring for butter.

&quot;Dorema ammoniacum&quot;, &quot;Ferula galbaniflua&quot;, and &quot;Ferula moschata&quot; (sumbul) are sources of incense.

The woody &quot;Azorella compacta&quot; Phil. has been used in South America for fuel.

== Toxicity ==
Many species in the family Apiaceae produce phototoxic substances (called furanocoumarins) that sensitize human skin to sunlight. Contact with plant parts that contain furanocoumarins, followed by exposure to sunlight, may cause phytophotodermatitis, a serious skin inflammation. Phototoxic species include &quot;Ammi majus&quot;, &quot;Notobubon galbanum,&quot; the parsnip (&quot;Pastinaca sativa&quot;) and numerous species of the genus &quot;Heracleum&quot;, especially the giant hogweed (&quot;Heracleum mantegazzianum&quot;). Of all the plant species that have been reported to induce phytophotodermatitis, approximately half belong to the family Apiaceae.

The family Apiaceae also includes a smaller number of poisonous species, including poison hemlock, water hemlock, spotted cowbane, fool&#x27;s parsley, and various species of water dropwort.

Some members of the family Apiaceae, including carrot, celery, fennel, parsley and parsnip, contain polyynes, an unusual class of organic compounds that exhibit cytotoxic effects.

<text>An axon (from Greek ἄξων &quot;áxōn&quot;, axis) or nerve fiber (or nerve fibre: see spelling differences) is a long, slender projection of a nerve cell, or neuron, in vertebrates, that typically conducts electrical impulses known as action potentials away from the nerve cell body. The function of the axon is to transmit information to different neurons, muscles, and glands. In certain sensory neurons (pseudounipolar neurons), such as those for touch and warmth, the axons are called afferent nerve fibers and the electrical impulse travels along these from the periphery to the cell body and from the cell body to the spinal cord along another branch of the same axon. Axon dysfunction can be the cause of many inherited and acquired neurological disorders that affect both the peripheral and central neurons. Nerve fibers are classed into three typesgroup A nerve fibers, group B nerve fibers, and group C nerve fibers. Groups A and B are myelinated, and group C are unmyelinated. These groups include both sensory fibers and motor fibers. Another classification groups only the sensory fibers as Type I, Type II, Type III, and Type IV.

An axon is one of two types of cytoplasmic protrusions from the cell body of a neuron; the other type is a dendrite. Axons are distinguished from dendrites by several features, including shape (dendrites often taper while axons usually maintain a constant radius), length (dendrites are restricted to a small region around the cell body while axons can be much longer), and function (dendrites receive signals whereas axons transmit them). Some types of neurons have no axon and transmit signals from their dendrites. In some species, axons can emanate from dendrites known as axon-carrying dendrites. No neuron ever has more than one axon; however in invertebrates such as insects or leeches the axon sometimes consists of several regions that function more or less independently of each other.

Axons are covered by a membrane known as an axolemma; the cytoplasm of an axon is called axoplasm. Most axons branch, in some cases very profusely. The end branches of an axon are called telodendria. The swollen end of a telodendron is known as the axon terminal or end-foot which joins the dendrite or cell body of another neuron forming a synaptic connection. Axons usually make contact with other neurons at junctions called synapses but can also make contact with muscle or gland cells. In some circumstances, the axon of one neuron may form a synapse with the dendrites of the same neuron, resulting in an autapse. At a synapse, the membrane of the axon closely adjoins the membrane of the target cell, and special molecular structures serve to transmit electrical or electrochemical signals across the gap. Some synaptic junctions appear along the length of an axon as it extends; these are called &quot;en passant boutons&quot; (&quot;in passing boutons&quot;) and can be in the hundreds or even the thousands along one axon. Other synapses appear as terminals at the ends of axonal branches.

A single axon, with all its branches taken together, can target multiple parts of the brain and generate thousands of synaptic terminals. A bundle of axons make a nerve tract in the central nervous system, and a fascicle in the peripheral nervous system. In placental mammals the largest white matter tract in the brain is the corpus callosum, formed of some 200 million axons in the human brain.

==Anatomy==

Axons are the primary transmission lines of the nervous system, and as bundles they form nerves in the peripheral nervous system, or nerve tracts in the central nervous system (CNS). Some axons can extend up to one meter or more while others extend as little as one millimeter. The longest axons in the human body are those of the sciatic nerve, which run from the base of the spinal cord to the big toe of each foot. The diameter of axons is also variable. Most individual axons are microscopic in diameter (typically about one micrometer (μm) across). The largest mammalian axons can reach a diameter of up to 20 μm. The squid giant axon, which is specialized to conduct signals very rapidly, is close to 1 millimeter in diameter, the size of a small pencil lead. The numbers of axonal telodendria (the branching structures at the end of the axon) can also differ from one nerve fiber to the next. Axons in the CNS typically show multiple telodendria, with many synaptic end points. In comparison, the cerebellar granule cell axon is characterized by a single T-shaped branch node from which two parallel fibers extend. Elaborate branching allows for the simultaneous transmission of messages to a large number of target neurons within a single region of the brain.

There are two types of axons in the nervous system: myelinated and unmyelinated axons. Myelin is a layer of a fatty insulating substance, which is formed by two types of glial cells: Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes. In the peripheral nervous system Schwann cells form the myelin sheath of a myelinated axon. Oligodendrocytes form the insulating myelin in the CNS. Along myelinated nerve fibers, gaps in the myelin sheath known as nodes of Ranvier occur at evenly spaced intervals. The myelination enables an especially rapid mode of electrical impulse propagation called saltatory conduction.

The myelinated axons from the cortical neurons form the bulk of the neural tissue called white matter in the brain. The myelin gives the white appearance to the tissue in contrast to the grey matter of the cerebral cortex which contains the neuronal cell bodies. A similar arrangement is seen in the cerebellum. Bundles of myelinated axons make up the nerve tracts in the CNS, and where they cross the midline of the brain to connect opposite regions they are called commissures. The largest of these is the corpus callosum that connects the two cerebral hemispheres, and this has around 20 million axons.

The structure of a neuron is seen to consist of two separate functional regions, or compartmentsthe cell body together with the dendrites as one region, and the axonal region as the other.

===Axonal region===
The axonal region or compartment, includes the axon hillock, the initial segment, the rest of the axon, and the axon telodendria, and axon terminals. It also includes the myelin sheath. The Nissl bodies that produce the neuronal proteins are absent in the axonal region. Proteins needed for the growth of the axon, and the removal of waste materials, need a framework for transport. This axonal transport is provided for in the axoplasm by arrangements of microtubules and type IV intermediate filaments known as neurofilaments.

====Axon hillock====

The axon hillock is the area formed from the cell body of the neuron as it extends to become the axon. It precedes the initial segment. The received action potentials that are summed in the neuron are transmitted to the axon hillock for the generation of an action potential from the initial segment.

====Axonal initial segment====
The axonal initial segment (AIS) is a structurally and functionally separate microdomain of the axon. One function of the initial segment is to separate the main part of an axon from the rest of the neuron; another function is to help initiate action potentials. Both of these functions support neuron cell polarity, in which dendrites (and, in some cases the soma) of a neuron receive input signals at the basal region, and at the apical region the neuron&#x27;s axon provides output signals.

The axon initial segment is unmyelinated and contains a specialized complex of proteins. It is between approximately 20 and 60 μm in length and functions as the site of action potential initiation. Both the position on the axon and the length of the AIS can change showing a degree of plasticity that can fine-tune the neuronal output. A longer AIS is associated with a greater excitability. Plasticity is also seen in the ability of the AIS to change its distribution and to maintain the activity of neural circuitry at a constant level.

The AIS is highly specialized for the fast conduction of nerve impulses. This is achieved by a high concentration of voltage-gated sodium channels in the initial segment where the action potential is initiated. The ion channels are accompanied by a high number of cell adhesion molecules and scaffold proteins that anchor them to the cytoskeleton. Interactions with ankyrin-G are important as it is the major organizer in the AIS.

In other cases as seen in rat studies an axon originates from a dendrite; such axons are said to have &quot;dendritic origin&quot;. Some axons with dendritic origin similarly have a &quot;proximal&quot; initial segment that starts directly at the axon origin, while others have a &quot;distal&quot; initial segment, discernibly separated from the axon origin. In many species some of the neurons have axons that emanate from the dendrite and not from the cell body, and these are known as axon-carrying dendrites. In many cases, an axon originates at an axon hillock on the soma; such axons are said to have &quot;somatic origin&quot;. Some axons with somatic origin have a &quot;proximal&quot; initial segment adjacent the axon hillock, while others have a &quot;distal&quot; initial segment, separated from the soma by an extended axon hillock.

===Axonal transport===

The axoplasm is the equivalent of cytoplasm in the cell. Microtubules form in the axoplasm at the axon hillock. They are arranged along the length of the axon, in overlapping sections, and all point in the same directiontowards the axon terminals. This is noted by the positive endings of the microtubules. This overlapping arrangement provides the routes for the transport of different materials from the cell body. Studies on the axoplasm has shown the movement of numerous vesicles of all sizes to be seen along cytoskeletal filamentsthe microtubules, and neurofilaments, in both directions between the axon and its terminals and the cell body.

Outgoing anterograde transport from the cell body along the axon, carries mitochondria and membrane proteins needed for growth to the axon terminal. Ingoing retrograde transport carries cell waste materials from the axon terminal to the cell body. Outgoing and ingoing tracks use different sets of motor proteins. Outgoing transport is provided by kinesin, and ingoing return traffic is provided by dynein. Dynein is minus-end directed. There are many forms of kinesin and dynein motor proteins, and each is thought to carry a different cargo. The studies on transport in the axon led to the naming of kinesin.

===Myelination===
In the nervous system, axons may be myelinated, or unmyelinated. This is the provision of an insulating layer, called a myelin sheath. The myelin membrane is unique in its relatively high lipid to protein ratio.

In the peripheral nervous system axons are myelinated by glial cells known as Schwann cells. In the central nervous system the myelin sheath is provided by another type of glial cell, the oligodendrocyte. Schwann cells myelinate a single axon. An oligodendrocyte can myelinate up to 50 axons.

The composition of myelin is different in the two types. In the CNS the major myelin protein is proteolipid protein, and in the PNS it is myelin basic protein.

===Nodes of Ranvier===

Nodes of Ranvier (also known as &quot;myelin sheath gaps&quot;) are short unmyelinated segments of a myelinated axon, which are found periodically interspersed between segments of the myelin sheath. Therefore, at the point of the node of Ranvier, the axon is reduced in diameter. These nodes are areas where action potentials can be generated. In saltatory conduction, electrical currents produced at each node of Ranvier are conducted with little attenuation to the next node in line, where they remain strong enough to generate another action potential. Thus in a myelinated axon, action potentials effectively &quot;jump&quot; from node to node, bypassing the myelinated stretches in between, resulting in a propagation speed much faster than even the fastest unmyelinated axon can sustain.

===Axon terminals===

An axon can divide into many branches called telodendria (Greek for &#x27;end of tree&#x27;). At the end of each telodendron is an axon terminal (also called a terminal bouton or synaptic bouton, or ). Axon terminals contain synaptic vesicles that store the neurotransmitter for release at the synapse. This makes multiple synaptic connections with other neurons possible. Sometimes the axon of a neuron may synapse onto dendrites of the same neuron, when it is known as an autapse. Some synaptic junctions appear along the length of an axon as it extends; these are called en passant boutons (&quot;in passing boutons&quot;) and can be in the hundreds or even the thousands along one axon.

====Axonal varicosities====
In the normally developed brain, along the shaft of some axons are located pre-synaptic boutons also known as axonal varicosities and these have been found in regions of the hippocampus that function in the release of neurotransmitters. However, axonal varicosities are also present in neurodegenerative diseases where they interfere with the conduction of an action potential. Axonal varicosities are also the hallmark of traumatic brain injuries. Axonal damage is usually to the axon cytoskeleton disrupting transport. As a consequence protein accumulations such as amyloid-beta precursor protein can build up in a swelling resulting in a number of varicosities along the axon.

==Action potentials==

Most axons carry signals in the form of action potentials, which are discrete electrochemical impulses that travel rapidly along an axon, starting at the cell body and terminating at points where the axon makes synaptic contact with target cells. The defining characteristic of an action potential is that it is &quot;all-or-nothing&quot;every action potential that an axon generates has essentially the same size and shape. This all-or-nothing characteristic allows action potentials to be transmitted from one end of a long axon to the other without any reduction in size. There are, however, some types of neurons with short axons that carry graded electrochemical signals, of variable amplitude.

When an action potential reaches a presynaptic terminal, it activates the synaptic transmission process. The first step is rapid opening of calcium ion channels in the membrane of the axon, allowing calcium ions to flow inward across the membrane. The resulting increase in intracellular calcium concentration causes synaptic vesicles (tiny containers enclosed by a lipid membrane) filled with a neurotransmitter chemical to fuse with the axon&#x27;s membrane and empty their contents into the extracellular space. The neurotransmitter is released from the presynaptic nerve through exocytosis. The neurotransmitter chemical then diffuses across to receptors located on the membrane of the target cell. The neurotransmitter binds to these receptors and activates them. Depending on the type of receptors that are activated, the effect on the target cell can be to excite the target cell, inhibit it, or alter its metabolism in some way. This entire sequence of events often takes place in less than a thousandth of a second. Afterward, inside the presynaptic terminal, a new set of vesicles is moved into position next to the membrane, ready to be released when the next action potential arrives. The action potential is the final electrical step in the integration of synaptic messages at the scale of the neuron.

Extracellular recordings of action potential propagation in axons has been demonstrated in freely moving animals. While extracellular somatic action potentials have been used to study cellular activity in freely moving animals such as place cells, axonal activity in both white and gray matter can also be recorded. Extracellular recordings of axon action potential propagation is distinct from somatic action potentials in three ways: 1. The signal has a shorter peak-trough duration (~150μs) than of pyramidal cells (~500μs) or interneurons (~250μs). 2. The voltage change is triphasic. 3. Activity recorded on a tetrode is seen on only one of the four recording wires. In recordings from freely moving rats, axonal signals have been isolated in white matter tracts including the alveus and the corpus callosum as well hippocampal gray matter.

In fact, the generation of action potentials in vivo is sequential in nature, and these sequential spikes constitute the digital codes in the neurons. Although previous studies indicate an axonal origin of a single spike evoked by short-term pulses, physiological signals in vivo trigger the initiation of sequential spikes at the cell bodies of the neurons.

In addition to propagating action potentials to axonal terminals, the axon is able to amplify the action potentials, which makes sure a secure propagation of sequential action potentials toward the axonal terminal. In terms of molecular mechanisms, voltage-gated sodium channels in the axons possess lower threshold and shorter refractory period in response to short-term pulses.

==Development and growth==
===Development===
The development of the axon to its target, is one of the six major stages in the overall development of the nervous system. Studies done on cultured hippocampal neurons suggest that neurons initially produce multiple neurites that are equivalent, yet only one of these neurites is destined to become the axon. It is unclear whether axon specification precedes axon elongation or vice versa, although recent evidence points to the latter. If an axon that is not fully developed is cut, the polarity can change and other neurites can potentially become the axon. This alteration of polarity only occurs when the axon is cut at least 10 μm shorter than the other neurites. After the incision is made, the longest neurite will become the future axon and all the other neurites, including the original axon, will turn into dendrites. Imposing an external force on a neurite, causing it to elongate, will make it become an axon. Nonetheless, axonal development is achieved through a complex interplay between extracellular signaling, intracellular signaling and cytoskeletal dynamics.

====Extracellular signaling====
The extracellular signals that propagate through the extracellular matrix surrounding neurons play a prominent role in axonal development. These signaling molecules include proteins, neurotrophic factors, and extracellular matrix and adhesion molecules.
Netrin (also known as UNC-6) a secreted protein, functions in axon formation. When the UNC-5 netrin receptor is mutated, several neurites are irregularly projected out of neurons and finally a single axon is extended anteriorly. The neurotrophic factorsnerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NTF3) are also involved in axon development and bind to Trk receptors.

The ganglioside-converting enzyme plasma membrane ganglioside sialidase (PMGS), which is involved in the activation of TrkA at the tip of neutrites, is required for the elongation of axons. PMGS asymmetrically distributes to the tip of the neurite that is destined to become the future axon.

====Intracellular signaling====
During axonal development, the activity of PI3K is increased at the tip of destined axon. Disrupting the activity of PI3K inhibits axonal development. Activation of PI3K results in the production of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns) which can cause significant elongation of a neurite, converting it into an axon. As such, the overexpression of phosphatases that dephosphorylate PtdIns leads into the failure of polarization.

====Cytoskeletal dynamics====
The neurite with the lowest actin filament content will become the axon. PGMS concentration and f-actin content are inversely correlated; when PGMS becomes enriched at the tip of a neurite, its f-actin content is substantially decreased. In addition, exposure to actin-depolimerizing drugs and toxin B (which inactivates Rho-signaling) causes the formation of multiple axons. Consequently, the interruption of the actin network in a growth cone will promote its neurite to become the axon.

===Growth===
Growing axons move through their environment via the growth cone, which is at the tip of the axon. The growth cone has a broad sheet-like extension called a lamellipodium which contain protrusions called filopodia. The filopodia are the mechanism by which the entire process adheres to surfaces and explores the surrounding environment. Actin plays a major role in the mobility of this system. Environments with high levels of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) create an ideal environment for axonal growth. This seems to provide a &quot;sticky&quot; surface for axons to grow along. Examples of CAMs specific to neural systems include N-CAM, TAG-1an axonal glycoproteinand MAG, all of which are part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Another set of molecules called extracellular matrix-adhesion molecules also provide a sticky substrate for axons to grow along. Examples of these molecules include laminin, fibronectin, tenascin, and perlecan. Some of these are surface bound to cells and thus act as short range attractants or repellents. Others are difusible ligands and thus can have long range effects.

Cells called guidepost cells assist in the guidance of neuronal axon growth. These cells that help axon guidance, are typically other neurons that are sometimes immature. When the axon has completed its growth at its connection to the target, the diameter of the axon can increase by up to five times, depending on the speed of conduction required.

It has also been discovered through research that if the axons of a neuron were damaged, as long as the soma (the cell body of a neuron) is not damaged, the axons would regenerate and remake the synaptic connections with neurons with the help of guidepost cells. This is also referred to as neuroregeneration.

Nogo-A is a type of neurite outgrowth inhibitory component that is present in the central nervous system myelin membranes (found in an axon). It has a crucial role in restricting axonal regeneration in adult mammalian central nervous system. In recent studies, if Nogo-A is blocked and neutralized, it is possible to induce long-distance axonal regeneration which leads to enhancement of functional recovery in rats and mouse spinal cord. This has yet to be done on humans. A recent study has also found that macrophages activated through a specific inflammatory pathway activated by the Dectin-1 receptor are capable of promoting axon recovery, also however causing neurotoxicity in the neuron.

===Length regulation===
Axons vary largely in length from a few micrometers up to meters in some animals. This emphasizes that there must be a cellular length regulation mechanism allowing the neurons both to sense the length of their axons and to control their growth accordingly. It was discovered that motor proteins play an important role in regulating the length of axons. Based on this observation, researchers developed an explicit model for axonal growth describing how motor proteins could affect the axon length on the molecular level. These studies suggest that motor proteins carry signaling molecules from the soma to the growth cone and vice versa whose concentration oscillates in time with a length-dependent frequency.

==Classification==

The axons of neurons in the human peripheral nervous system can be classified based on their physical features and signal conduction properties. Axons were known to have different thicknesses (from 0.1 to 20 μm) and these differences were thought to relate to the speed at which an action potential could travel along the axonits &quot;conductance velocity&quot;. Erlanger and Gasser proved this hypothesis, and identified several types of nerve fiber, establishing a relationship between the diameter of an axon and its nerve conduction velocity. They published their findings in 1941 giving the first classification of axons.

Axons are classified in two systems. The first one introduced by Erlanger and Gasser, grouped the fibers into three main groups using the letters A, B, and C. These groups, group A, group B, and group C include both the sensory fibers (afferents) and the motor fibers (efferents). The first group A, was subdivided into alpha, beta, gamma, and delta fibersAα, Aβ, Aγ, and Aδ. The motor neurons of the different motor fibers, were the lower motor neuronsalpha motor neuron, beta motor neuron, and gamma motor neuron having the Aα, Aβ, and Aγ nerve fibers, respectively.

Later findings by other researchers identified two groups of Aa fibers that were sensory fibers. These were then introduced into a system (Lloyd classification) that only included sensory fibers (though some of these were mixed nerves and were also motor fibers). This system refers to the sensory groups as Types and uses Roman numerals: Type Ia, Type Ib, Type II, Type III, and Type IV.

=== Motor === 
Lower motor neurons have two kind of fibers:

Different sensory receptors are innervated by different types of nerve fibers. Proprioceptors are innervated by type Ia, Ib and II sensory fibers, mechanoreceptors by type II and III sensory fibers and nociceptors and thermoreceptors by type III and IV sensory fibers.

===Autonomic===
The autonomic nervous system has two kinds of peripheral fibers:

==Clinical significance==

In order of degree of severity, injury to a nerve in the peripheral nervous system can be described as neurapraxia, axonotmesis, or neurotmesis.
Concussion is considered a mild form of diffuse axonal injury. Axonal injury can also cause central chromatolysis. The dysfunction of axons in the nervous system is one of the major causes of many inherited and acquired neurological disorders that affect both peripheral and central neurons.

When an axon is crushed, an active process of axonal degeneration takes place at the part of the axon furthest from the cell body. This degeneration takes place quickly following the injury, with the part of the axon being sealed off at the membranes and broken down by macrophages. This is known as Wallerian degeneration. Dying back of an axon can also take place in many neurodegenerative diseases, particularly when axonal transport is impaired, this is known as Wallerian-like degeneration. Studies suggest that the degeneration happens as
a result of the axonal protein NMNAT2, being prevented from reaching all of the axon.

Demyelination of axons causes the multitude of neurological symptoms found in the disease multiple sclerosis.

Dysmyelination is the abnormal formation of the myelin sheath. This is implicated in several leukodystrophies, and also in schizophrenia.

A severe traumatic brain injury can result in widespread lesions to nerve tracts damaging the axons in a condition known as diffuse axonal injury. This can lead to a persistent vegetative state. It has been shown in studies on the rat that axonal damage from a single mild traumatic brain injury, can leave a susceptibility to further damage, after repeated mild traumatic brain injuries.

A nerve guidance conduit is an artificial means of guiding axon growth to enable neuroregeneration, and is one of the many treatments used for different kinds of nerve injury.

== Terminology ==
Some general dictionaries define &quot;nerve fiber&quot; as any neuronal process, including both axons and dendrites. However, medical sources generally use &quot;nerve fiber&quot; to refer to the axon only.

==History==
German anatomist Otto Friedrich Karl Deiters is generally credited with the discovery of the axon by distinguishing it from the dendrites. Swiss Rüdolf Albert von Kölliker and German Robert Remak were the first to identify and characterize the axon initial segment. Kölliker named the axon in 1896. Louis-Antoine Ranvier was the first to describe the gaps or nodes found on axons and for this contribution these axonal features are now commonly referred to as the nodes of Ranvier. Santiago Ramón y Cajal, a Spanish anatomist, proposed that axons were the output components of neurons, describing their functionality. Joseph Erlanger and Herbert Gasser earlier developed the classification system for peripheral nerve fibers, based on axonal conduction velocity, myelination, fiber size etc. Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley also employed the squid giant axon (1939) and by 1952 they had obtained a full quantitative description of the ionic basis of the action potential, leading to the formulation of the Hodgkin–Huxley model. Hodgkin and Huxley were awarded jointly the Nobel Prize for this work in 1963. The formulae detailing axonal conductance were extended to vertebrates in the Frankenhaeuser–Huxley equations. The understanding of the biochemical basis for action potential propagation has advanced further, and includes many details about individual ion channels.

==Other animals==
The axons in invertebrates have been extensively studied. The longfin inshore squid, often used as a model organism has the longest known axon. The giant squid has the largest axon known. Its size ranges from 0.5 (typically) to 1 mm in diameter and is used in the control of its jet propulsion system. The fastest recorded conduction speed of 210 m/s, is found in the ensheathed axons of some pelagic Penaeid shrimps and the usual range is between 90 and 200 meters/s (cf 100–120 m/s for the fastest myelinated vertebrate axon.)

<text>The ancient Aramaic alphabet was used to write the Aramaic languages spoken by ancient Aramean pre-Christian peoples throughout the Fertile Crescent. It was also adopted by other peoples as their own alphabet when empires and their subjects underwent linguistic Aramaization during a language shift for governing purposes — a precursor to Arabization centuries later — including among the Assyrians and Babylonians who permanently replaced their Akkadian language and its cuneiform script with Aramaic and its script, and among Jews, but not Samaritans, who adopted the Aramaic language as their vernacular and started using the Aramaic alphabet, which they call &quot;Square Script&quot;, even for writing Hebrew, displacing the former Paleo-Hebrew alphabet. The modern Hebrew alphabet derives from the Aramaic alphabet, in contrast to the modern Samaritan alphabet, which derives from Paleo-Hebrew.

The letters in the Aramaic alphabet all represent consonants, some of which are also used as &quot;matres lectionis&quot; to indicate long vowels. Writing systems, like the Aramaic, that indicate consonants but do not indicate most vowels other than by means of &quot;matres lectionis&quot; or added diacritical signs, have been called abjads by Peter T. Daniels to distinguish them from alphabets such as the Greek alphabet, that represent vowels more systematically. The term was coined to avoid the notion that a writing system that represents sounds must be either a syllabary or an alphabet, which would imply that a system like Aramaic must be either a syllabary, as argued by Ignace Gelb, or an incomplete or deficient alphabet, as most other writers had said before Daniels. Daniels put forward, this is a different type of writing system, intermediate between syllabaries and &#x27;full&#x27; alphabets.

The Aramaic alphabet is historically significant since virtually all modern Middle Eastern writing systems can be traced back to it. That is primarily due to the widespread usage of the Aramaic language after it was adopted as both a &quot;lingua franca&quot; and the official language of the Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian Empires, and their successor, the Achaemenid Empire. Among the descendant scripts in modern use, the Jewish Hebrew alphabet bears the closest relation to the Imperial Aramaic script of the 5th century BC, with an identical letter inventory and, for the most part, nearly identical letter shapes. By contrast the Samaritan Hebrew script is directly descended from Proto-Hebrew/Phoenician script, which was the ancestor of the Aramaic alphabet. The Aramaic alphabet was also an ancestor to the Syriac alphabet and Mongolian script and Kharosthi and Brahmi,and Nabataean alphabet, which had the Arabic alphabet as a descendant.

== History ==

The earliest inscriptions in the Aramaic language use the Phoenician alphabet. Over time, the alphabet developed into the Aramaic alphabet by the 8th century BC. It was used to write the Aramaic languages spoken by ancient Aramean pre-Christian tribes throughout the Fertile Crescent. It was also adopted by other peoples as their own alphabet when empires and their subjects underwent linguistic Aramaization during a language shift for governing purposes — a precursor to Arabization centuries later. 

These include the Assyrians and Babylonians, who permanently replaced their Akkadian language and its cuneiform script with Aramaic and its script, and among Jews, but not Samaritans, who adopted the Aramaic language as their vernacular and started using the Aramaic alphabet even for writing Hebrew, displacing the former Paleo-Hebrew alphabet. The modern Hebrew alphabet derives from the Aramaic alphabet, in contrast to the modern Samaritan alphabet, which derives from Paleo-Hebrew.

=== Achaemenid Empire (The First Persian Empire) ===
Around 500 BC, following the Achaemenid conquest of Mesopotamia under Darius I, Old Aramaic was adopted by the Persians as the &quot;vehicle for written communication between the different regions of the vast Persian empire with its different peoples and languages. The use of a single official language, which modern scholarship has dubbed as Official Aramaic, Imperial Aramaic or Achaemenid Aramaic, can be assumed to have greatly contributed to the astonishing success of the Achaemenid Persians in holding their far-flung empire together for as long as they did.&quot;

Imperial Aramaic was highly standardised. Its orthography was based more on historical roots than any spoken dialect and was influenced by Old Persian. The Aramaic glyph forms of the period are often divided into two main styles, the &quot;lapidary&quot; form, usually inscribed on hard surfaces like stone monuments, and a cursive form whose lapidary form tended to be more conservative by remaining more visually similar to Phoenician and early Aramaic. Both were in use through the Achaemenid Persian period, but the cursive form steadily gained ground over the lapidary, which had largely disappeared by the 3rd century BC.

For centuries after the fall of the Achaemenid Empire in 331 BC, Imperial Aramaic, or something near enough to it to be recognisable, remained an influence on the various native Iranian languages. The Aramaic script survived as the essential characteristics of the Iranian Pahlavi writing system.

30 Aramaic documents from Bactria have been recently discovered, an analysis of which was published in November 2006. The texts, which were rendered on leather, reflect the use of Aramaic in the 4th century BC, in the Persian Achaemenid administration of Bactria and Sogdiana.

The widespread usage of Achaemenid Aramaic in the Middle East led to the gradual adoption of the Aramaic alphabet for writing Hebrew. Formerly, Hebrew had been written using an alphabet closer in form to that of Phoenician, the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet.

===Aramaic-derived scripts===

Since the evolution of the Aramaic alphabet out of the Phoenician one was a gradual process, the division of the world&#x27;s alphabets into the ones derived from the Phoenician one directly, and the ones derived from Phoenician via Aramaic, is somewhat artificial. In general, the alphabets of the Mediterranean region (Anatolia, Greece, Italy) are classified as Phoenician-derived, adapted from around the 8th century BC. Those of the East (the Levant, Persia, Central Asia, and India) are considered Aramaic-derived, adapted from around the 6th century BC from the Imperial Aramaic script of the Achaemenid Empire.

After the fall of the Achaemenid Empire, the unity of the Imperial Aramaic script was lost, diversifying into a number of descendant cursives.

The Hebrew and Nabataean alphabets, as they stood by the Roman era, were little changed in style from the Imperial Aramaic alphabet. Ibn Khaldun (1332–1406) alleges that not only the old Nabataean writing was influenced by the &quot;Syrian script&quot; (i.e. Aramaic), but also the old Chaldean script.

A cursive Hebrew variant developed from the early centuries AD. It remained restricted to the status of a variant used alongside the noncursive. By contrast, the cursive developed out of the Nabataean alphabet in the same period soon became the standard for writing Arabic, evolving into the Arabic alphabet as it stood by the time of the early spread of Islam.

The development of cursive versions of Aramaic led to the creation of the Syriac, Palmyrene and Mandaic alphabets, which formed the basis of the historical scripts of Central Asia, such as the Sogdian and Mongolian alphabets.

The Old Turkic script is generally considered to have its ultimate origins in Aramaic, in particular via the Pahlavi or Sogdian alphabets, as suggested by V. Thomsen, or possibly via Kharosthi (&quot;cf&quot;., Issyk inscription).

Brahmi script was also possibly derived or inspired by Aramaic. Brahmic family of scripts includes Devanagari.

==Languages using the alphabet==
Today, Biblical Aramaic, Jewish Neo-Aramaic dialects and the Aramaic language of the Talmud are written in the modern-Hebrew alphabet, distinguished from the Old Hebrew script. In classical Jewish literature, the name given to the modern-Hebrew script was &quot;Ashurit&quot;, the ancient Assyrian script, a script now known widely as the Aramaic script. It is believed that, during the period of Assyrian dominion, Aramaic script and language received official status. 

Syriac and Christian Neo-Aramaic dialects are today written in the Syriac alphabet, which script has superseded the more ancient Assyrian script and now bears its name. Mandaic is written in the Mandaic alphabet. The near-identical nature of the Aramaic and the classical Hebrew alphabets caused Aramaic text to be typeset mostly in the standard Hebrew script in scholarly literature.

===Maaloula===

In Maaloula, one of few surviving communities in which a Western Aramaic dialect is still spoken, an Aramaic Language Institute was established in 2006 by Damascus University that teaches courses to keep the language alive.

Unlike Classical Syriac, which has a rich literary tradition in Syriac-Aramaic script, Western Neo-Aramaic was solely passed down orally for generations until 2006 and was not utilized in a written form.
Therefore, the Language Institute&#x27;s chairman, George Rizkalla (Rezkallah), undertook the writing of a textbook in Western Neo-Aramaic. Being previously unwritten, Rizkalla opted for the Hebrew alphabet. In 2010, the institute&#x27;s activities were halted due to concerns that the square Maalouli-Aramaic alphabet used in the program bore a resemblance to the square script of the Hebrew alphabet. As a result, all signs featuring the square Maalouli script were subsequently removed. The program stated that they would instead use the more distinct Syriac-Aramaic alphabet, although use of the Maalouli alphabet has continued to some degree. Al Jazeera Arabic also broadcast a program about Western Neo-Aramaic and the villages in which it is spoken with the square script still in use.

==Unicode==
The Imperial Aramaic alphabet was added to the Unicode Standard in October 2009, with the release of version 5.2.

The Unicode block for Imperial Aramaic is U+10840–U+1085F:

The Syriac Aramaic alphabet was added to the Unicode Standard in September 1999, with the release of version 3.0.

The Syriac Abbreviation (a type of overline) can be represented with a special control character called the Syriac Abbreviation Mark (U+070F). The Unicode block for Syriac Aramaic is U+0700–U+074F:

<text>An American shot or cowboy shot is a medium-long (&quot;knee&quot;) film shot of a group of characters, who are arranged so that all are visible to the camera. It is a translation of a phrase from French film criticism, &quot;.&quot; The usual arrangement is for the actors to stand in an irregular line from one side of the screen to the other, with the actors at the end coming forward a little and standing more in profile than the others. The purpose of the composition is to allow complex dialogue scenes to be played out without changes in camera position. In some literature, this is simply referred to as a 3/4 shot.

One of the other main reasons why French critics called it &quot;American shot&quot; was its frequent use in the western genre. This was because a shot that started at knee level would reveal the weapon of a cowboy, usually holstered at their waist. It is the closest the camera can get to an actor while keeping both their face and their holstered gun in frame.

The French critics thought it was characteristic of American films of the 1930s or 1940s; however, it was mostly characteristic of cheaper American movies, such as Charlie Chan mysteries where people collected in front of a fireplace or at the foot of the stairs in order to explain what happened a few minutes ago.

Howard Hawks legitimized this style in his films, allowing characters to act, even when not talking, when most of the audience would not be paying attention. It became his trademark style.

<text>Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), or acute [[Demyelinating disease|demyelinating]] encephalomyelitis, is a rare autoimmune disease marked by a sudden, widespread attack of inflammation in the brain and spinal cord. As well as causing the brain and spinal cord to become inflamed, ADEM also attacks the nerves of the central nervous system and damages their myelin insulation, which, as a result, destroys the white matter. The cause is often a trigger such as from viral infection or vaccinations.

ADEM&#x27;s symptoms resemble the symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS), so the disease itself is sorted into the classification of the multiple sclerosis borderline diseases. However, ADEM has several features that distinguish it from MS. Unlike MS, ADEM occurs usually in children and is marked with rapid fever, although adolescents and adults can get the disease too. ADEM consists of a single flare-up whereas MS is marked with several flare-ups (or relapses), over a long period of time. Relapses following ADEM are reported in up to a quarter of patients, but the majority of these &#x27;multiphasic&#x27; presentations following ADEM likely represent MS. ADEM is also distinguished by a loss of consciousness, coma and death, which is very rare in MS, except in severe cases.

It affects about 8 per 1,000,000 people per year. Although it occurs in all ages, most reported cases are in children and adolescents, with the average age around 5 to 8 years old. The disease affects males and females almost equally. ADEM shows seasonal variation with higher incidence in winter and spring months which may coincide with higher viral infections during these months. The mortality rate may be as high as 5%; however, full recovery is seen in 50 to 75% of cases with increase in survival rates up to 70 to 90% with figures including minor residual disability as well. The average time to recover from ADEM flare-ups is one to six months.

ADEM produces multiple inflammatory lesions in the brain and spinal cord, particularly in the white matter. Usually these are found in the subcortical and central white matter and cortical gray-white junction of both cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord, but periventricular white matter and gray matter of the cortex, thalami and basal ganglia may also be involved.

When a person has more than one demyelinating episode of ADEM, the disease is then called recurrent disseminated encephalomyelitis or multiphasic disseminated encephalomyelitis (MDEM). Also, a fulminant course in adults has been described.

==Signs and symptoms==
ADEM has an abrupt onset and a monophasic course. Symptoms usually begin 1–3 weeks after infection. Major symptoms include fever, headache, nausea and vomiting, confusion, vision impairment, drowsiness, seizures and coma. Although initially the symptoms are usually mild, they worsen rapidly over the course of hours to days, with the average time to maximum severity being about four and a half days. Additional symptoms include hemiparesis, paraparesis, and cranial nerve palsies.

=== ADEM in COVID-19 ===
Neurological symptoms were the main presentation of COVID-19, which did not correlate with the severity of respiratory symptoms. The high incidence of ADEM with hemorrhage is striking. Brain inflammation is likely caused by an immune response to the disease rather than neurotropism. CSF analysis was not indicative of an infectious process, neurological impairment was not present in the acute phase of the infection, and neuroimaging findings were not typical of classical toxic and metabolic disorders. The finding of bilateral periventricular relatively asymmetrical lesions allied with deep white matter involvement, that may also be present in cortical gray-white matter junction, thalami, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and brainstem suggests an acute demyelination process. Additionally, hemorrhagic white matter lesions, clusters of macrophages related to axonal injury and ADEM-like appearance were also found in subcortical white matter.

==Causes==
Since the discovery of the anti-MOG specificity against multiple sclerosis diagnosis it is considered that ADEM is one of the possible clinical causes of anti-MOG associated encephalomyelitis.

About how the anti-MOG antibodies appear in the patients serum there are several theories:
* A preceding antigenic challenge can be identified in approximately two-thirds of people. Some viral infections thought to induce ADEM include influenza virus, dengue, enterovirus, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella zoster, Epstein–Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, hepatitis A, coxsackievirus and COVID-19. Bacterial infections include Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Borrelia burgdorferi, Leptospira, and beta-hemolytic Streptococci.
* Exposure to vaccines: The only vaccine proven related to ADEM is the Semple form of the rabies vaccine, but hepatitis B, pertussis, diphtheria, measles, mumps, rubella, pneumococcus, varicella, influenza, Japanese encephalitis, and polio vaccines have all been associated with the condition. The majority of the studies that correlate vaccination with ADEM onset use only small samples or are case studies. Large-scale epidemiological studies (e.g., of MMR vaccine or smallpox vaccine) do not show increased risk of ADEM following vaccination. An upper bound for the risk of ADEM from measles vaccination, if it exists, can be estimated to be 10 per million, which is far lower than the risk of developing ADEM from an actual measles infection, which is about 1 per 1,000 cases. For a rubella infection, the risk is 1 per 5,000 cases. Some early vaccines, later shown to have been contaminated with host animal CNS tissue, had ADEM incidence rates as high as 1 in 600.
* In rare cases, ADEM seems to follow from organ transplantation.

==Diagnosis==

The term ADEM has been inconsistently used at different times. Currently, the commonly accepted international standard for the clinical case definition is the one published by the International Pediatric MS Study Group, revision 2007.

Given that the definition is clinical, it is currently unknown if all the cases of ADEM are positive for anti-MOG autoantibody; in any case, it appears to be strongly related to ADEM diagnosis.

===Differential diagnosis===
====Multiple sclerosis====
While ADEM and MS both involve autoimmune demyelination, they differ in many clinical, genetic, imaging, and histopathological aspects. Some authors consider MS and its borderline forms to constitute a spectrum, differing only in chronicity, severity, and clinical course, while others consider them discretely different diseases.

Typically, ADEM appears in children following an antigenic challenge and remains monophasic. Nevertheless, ADEM does occur in adults, and can also be clinically multiphasic.

Problems for differential diagnosis increase due to the lack of agreement for a definition of multiple sclerosis. If MS were defined only by the separation in time and space of the demyelinating lesions as McDonald did, it would not be enough to make a difference, as some cases of ADEM satisfy these conditions. Therefore, some authors propose to establish the dividing line as the shape of the lesions around the veins, being therefore &quot;perivenous vs. confluent demyelination&quot;.

The pathology of ADEM is very similar to that of MS with some differences. The pathological hallmark of ADEM is perivenous inflammation with limited &quot;sleeves of demyelination&quot;. Nevertheless, MS-like plaques (confluent demyelination) can appear

Plaques in the white matter in MS are sharply delineated, while the glial scar in ADEM is smooth. Axons are better preserved in ADEM lesions. Inflammation in ADEM is widely disseminated and ill-defined, and finally, lesions are strictly perivenous, while in MS they are disposed around veins, but not so sharply.

Nevertheless, the co-occurrence of perivenous and confluent demyelination in some individuals suggests pathogenic overlap between acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis and misclassification even with biopsy or even postmortem ADEM in adults can progress to MS

====Multiphasic disseminated encephalomyelitis====

When the person has more than one demyelinating episode of ADEM, the disease is then called recurrent disseminated encephalomyelitis or multiphasic disseminated encephalomyelitis (MDEM).

It has been found that anti-MOG auto-antibodies are related to this kind of ADEM

Another variant of ADEM in adults has been described, also related to anti-MOG auto-antibodies, has been named fulminant disseminated encephalomyelitis, and it has been reported to be clinically ADEM, but showing MS-like lesions on autopsy. It has been classified inside the anti-MOG associated inflammatory demyelinating diseases.

====Acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis====

Acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis (AHL, or AHLE), acute hemorrhagic encephalomyelitis (AHEM), acute necrotizing hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis (ANHLE), Weston-Hurst syndrome, or Hurst&#x27;s disease, is a hyperacute and frequently fatal form of ADEM. AHL is relatively rare (less than 100 cases have been reported in the medical literature ), it is seen in about 2% of ADEM cases, and is characterized by necrotizing vasculitis of venules and hemorrhage, and edema. Death is common in the first week and overall mortality is about 70%, but increasing evidence points to favorable outcomes after aggressive treatment with corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, cyclophosphamide, and plasma exchange. About 70% of survivors show residual neurological deficits, but some survivors have shown surprisingly little deficit considering the extent of the white matter affected.

This disease has been occasionally associated with ulcerative colitis and Crohn&#x27;s disease, malaria, sepsis associated with immune complex deposition, methanol poisoning, and other underlying conditions. Also anecdotal association with MS has been reported

Laboratory studies that support diagnosis of AHL are: peripheral leukocytosis, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis associated with normal glucose and increased protein. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), lesions of AHL typically show extensive T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) white matter hyperintensities with areas of hemorrhages, significant edema, and mass effect.

==Treatment==
No controlled clinical trials have been conducted on ADEM treatment, but aggressive treatment aimed at rapidly reducing inflammation of the CNS is standard. The widely accepted first-line treatment is high doses of intravenous corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone or dexamethasone, followed by 3–6 weeks of gradually lower oral doses of prednisolone. Patients treated with methylprednisolone have shown better outcomes than those treated with dexamethasone. Oral tapers of less than three weeks duration show a higher chance of relapsing, and tend to show poorer outcomes. Other anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive therapies have been reported to show beneficial effect, such as plasmapheresis, high doses of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), mitoxantrone and cyclophosphamide. These are considered alternative therapies, used when corticosteroids cannot be used or fail to show an effect.

There is some evidence to suggest that patients may respond to a combination of methylprednisolone and immunoglobulins if they fail to respond to either separately
In a study of 16 children with ADEM, 10 recovered completely after high-dose methylprednisolone, one severe case that failed to respond to steroids recovered completely after IV Ig; the five most severe cases – with ADAM and severe peripheral neuropathy – were treated with combined high-dose methylprednisolone and immunoglobulin, two remained paraplegic, one had motor and cognitive handicaps, and two recovered. A recent review of IVIg treatment of ADEM (of which the previous study formed the bulk of the cases) found that 70% of children showed complete recovery after treatment with IVIg, or IVIg plus corticosteroids. A study of IVIg treatment in adults with ADEM showed that IVIg seems more effective in treating sensory and motor disturbances, while steroids seem more effective in treating impairments of cognition, consciousness and rigor. This same study found one subject, a 71-year-old man who had not responded to steroids, that responded to an IVIg treatment 58 days after disease onset.

==Prognosis==
Full recovery is seen in 50 to 70% of cases, ranging to 70 to 90% recovery with some minor residual disability (typically assessed using measures such as mRS or EDSS), average time to recover is one to six months. The mortality rate may be as high as 5–10%. Poorer outcomes are associated with unresponsiveness to steroid therapy, unusually severe neurological symptoms, or sudden onset. Children tend to have more favorable outcomes than adults, and cases presenting without fevers tend to have poorer outcomes. The latter effect may be due to either protective effects of fever, or that diagnosis and treatment is sought more rapidly when fever is present. 

ADEM can progress to MS. It will be considered MS if some lesions appear in different times and brain areas

===Motor deficits===
Residual motor deficits are estimated to remain in about 8 to 30% of cases, the range in severity from mild clumsiness to ataxia and hemiparesis.

===Neurocognitive===
Patients with demyelinating illnesses, such as MS, have shown cognitive deficits even when there is minimal physical disability. Research suggests that similar effects are seen after ADEM, but that the deficits are less severe than those seen in MS. A study of six children with ADEM (mean age at presentation 7.7 years) were tested for a range of neurocognitive tests after an average of 3.5 years of recovery. All six children performed in the normal range on most tests, including verbal IQ and performance IQ, but performed at least one standard deviation below age norms in at least one cognitive domain, such as complex attention (one child), short-term memory (one child) and internalizing behaviour/affect (two children). Group means for each cognitive domain were all within one standard deviation of age norms, demonstrating that, as a group, they were normal. These deficits were less severe than those seen in similar aged children with a diagnosis of MS.

Another study compared nineteen children with a history of ADEM, of which 10 were five years of age or younger at the time (average age 3.8 years old, tested an average of 3.9 years later) and nine were older (mean age 7.7y at time of ADEM, tested an average of 2.2 years later) to nineteen matched controls. Scores on IQ tests and educational achievement were lower for the young onset ADEM group (average IQ 90) compared to the late onset (average IQ 100) and control groups (average IQ 106), while the late onset ADEM children scored lower on verbal processing speed. Again, all groups means were within one standard deviation of the controls, meaning that while effects were statistically reliable, the children were as a whole, still within the normal range. There were also more behavioural problems in the early onset group, although there is some suggestion that this may be due, at least in part, to the stress of hospitalization at a young age.

==Research==

The relationship between ADEM and anti-MOG associated encephalomyelitis is currently under research. A new entity called MOGDEM has been proposed.

About animal models, the main animal model for MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is also an animal model for ADEM. Being an acute monophasic illness, EAE is far more similar to ADEM than MS.

<text>Ataxia (from Greek α- [a negative prefix] + -τάξις [order] = &quot;lack of order&quot;) is a neurological sign consisting of lack of voluntary coordination of muscle movements that can include gait abnormality, speech changes, and abnormalities in eye movements, that indicates dysfunction of parts of the nervous system that coordinate movement, such as the cerebellum.

These nervous system dysfunctions occur in several different patterns, with different results and different possible causes. Ataxia can be limited to one side of the body, which is referred to as hemiataxia. Friedreich&#x27;s ataxia has gait abnormality as the most commonly presented symptom. Dystaxia is a mild degree of ataxia.

== Types ==
=== Cerebellar ===

The term cerebellar ataxia is used to indicate ataxia due to dysfunction of the cerebellum. The cerebellum is responsible for integrating a significant amount of neural information that is used to coordinate smoothly ongoing movements and to participate in motor planning. Although ataxia is not present with all cerebellar lesions, many conditions affecting the cerebellum do produce ataxia. People with cerebellar ataxia may have trouble regulating the force, range, direction, velocity, and rhythm of muscle contractions. This results in a characteristic type of irregular, uncoordinated movement that can manifest itself in many possible ways, such as asthenia, asynergy, delayed reaction time, and dyschronometria. Individuals with cerebellar ataxia could also display instability of gait, difficulty with eye movements, dysarthria, dysphagia, hypotonia, dysmetria, and dysdiadochokinesia. These deficits can vary depending on which cerebellar structures have been damaged, and whether the lesion is bi- or unilateral.

People with cerebellar ataxia may initially present with poor balance, which could be demonstrated as an inability to stand on one leg or perform tandem gait. As the condition progresses, walking is characterized by a widened base and high stepping, as well as staggering and lurching from side to side. Turning is also problematic and could result in falls. As cerebellar ataxia becomes severe, great assistance and effort are needed to stand and walk. Dysarthria, an impairment with articulation, may also be present and is characterized by &quot;scanning&quot; speech that consists of slower rate, irregular rhythm, and variable volume. Also, slurring of speech, tremor of the voice, and ataxic respiration may occur. Cerebellar ataxia could result with incoordination of movement, particularly in the extremities. Overshooting (or hypermetria) occurs with finger-to-nose testing and heel to shin testing; thus, dysmetria is evident. Impairments with alternating movements (dysdiadochokinesia), as well as dysrhythmia, may also be displayed. Tremor of the head and trunk (titubation) may be seen in individuals with cerebellar ataxia.

Dysmetria is thought to be caused by a deficit in the control of interaction torques in multijoint motion. Interaction torques are created at an associated joint when the primary joint is moved. For example, if a movement required reaching to touch a target in front of the body, flexion at the shoulder would create a torque at the elbow, while extension of the elbow would create a torque at the wrist. These torques increase as the speed of movement increases and must be compensated and adjusted for to create coordinated movement. This may, therefore, explain decreased coordination at higher movement velocities and accelerations.
* Dysfunction of the vestibulocerebellum (flocculonodular lobe) impairs balance and the control of eye movements. This presents itself with postural instability, in which the person tends to separate his/her feet upon standing, to gain a wider base and to avoid titubation (bodily oscillations tending to be forward-backward ones). The instability is, therefore, worsened when standing with the feet together, regardless of whether the eyes are open or closed. This is a negative Romberg&#x27;s test, or more accurately, it denotes the individual&#x27;s inability to carry out the test, because the individual feels unstable even with open eyes. 
* Dysfunction of the spinocerebellum (vermis and associated areas near the midline) presents itself with a wide-based &quot;drunken sailor&quot; gait (called truncal ataxia), characterised by uncertain starts and stops, lateral deviations, and unequal steps. As a result of this gait impairment, falling is a concern in patients with ataxia. Studies examining falls in this population show that 74–93% of patients have fallen at least once in the past year and up to 60% admit to fear of falling.
* Dysfunction of the cerebrocerebellum (lateral hemispheres) presents as disturbances in carrying out voluntary, planned movements by the extremities (called appendicular ataxia). These include:
** Intention tremor (coarse trembling, accentuated over the execution of voluntary movements, possibly involving the head and eyes, as well as the limbs and torso)
** Peculiar writing abnormalities (large, unequal letters, irregular underlining)
** A peculiar pattern of dysarthria (slurred speech, sometimes characterised by explosive variations in voice intensity despite a regular rhythm)
** Inability to perform rapidly alternating movements, known as dysdiadochokinesia, occurs, and could involve rapidly switching from pronation to supination of the forearm. Movements become more irregular with increases of speed.
** Inability to judge distances or ranges of movement happens. This dysmetria is often seen as undershooting, hypometria, or overshooting, hypermetria, the required distance or range to reach a target. This is sometimes seen when a patient is asked to reach out and touch someone&#x27;s finger or touch his or her own nose.
** The rebound phenomenon, also known as the loss of the check reflex, is also sometimes seen in patients with cerebellar ataxia, for example, when patients are flexing their elbows isometrically against a resistance. When the resistance is suddenly removed without warning, the patients&#x27; arms may swing up and even strike themselves. With an intact check reflex, the patients check and activate the opposing triceps to slow and stop the movement.
** Patients may exhibit a constellation of subtle to overt cognitive symptoms, which are gathered under the terminology of Schmahmann&#x27;s syndrome.

=== Sensory ===
The term sensory ataxia is used to indicate ataxia due to loss of proprioception, the loss of sensitivity to the positions of joint and body parts. This is generally caused by dysfunction of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord, because they carry proprioceptive information up to the brain. In some cases, the cause of sensory ataxia may instead be dysfunction of the various parts of the brain that receive positional information, including the cerebellum, thalamus, and parietal lobes.

Sensory ataxia presents itself with an unsteady &quot;stomping&quot; gait with heavy heel strikes, as well as a postural instability that is usually worsened when the lack of proprioceptive input cannot be compensated for by visual input, such as in poorly lit environments.

Physicians can find evidence of sensory ataxia during physical examination by having patients stand with their feet together and eyes shut. In affected patients, this will cause the instability to worsen markedly, producing wide oscillations and possibly a fall; this is called a positive Romberg&#x27;s test. Worsening of the finger-pointing test with the eyes closed is another feature of sensory ataxia. Also, when patients are standing with arms and hands extended toward the physician, if the eyes are closed, the patients&#x27; fingers tend to &quot;fall down&quot; and then be restored to the horizontal extended position by sudden muscular contractions (the &quot;ataxic hand&quot;).

=== Vestibular ===
The term vestibular ataxia is used to indicate ataxia due to dysfunction of the vestibular system, which in acute and unilateral cases is associated with prominent vertigo, nausea, and vomiting. In slow-onset, chronic bilateral cases of vestibular dysfunction, these characteristic manifestations may be absent, and dysequilibrium may be the sole presentation.

== Causes ==
The three types of ataxia have overlapping causes, so can either coexist or occur in isolation. Cerebellar ataxia can have many causes despite normal neuroimaging.

=== Focal lesions ===
Any type of focal lesion of the central nervous system (such as stroke, brain tumor, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory [such as sarcoidosis], and &quot;chronic lymphocytyc inflammation with pontine perivascular enhancement responsive to steroids syndrome&quot; [CLIPPERS]) will cause the type of ataxia corresponding to the site of the lesion: cerebellar if in the cerebellum; sensory if in the dorsal spinal cord...to include cord compression by thickened ligamentum flavum or stenosis of the boney spinal canal...(and rarely in the thalamus or parietal lobe); or vestibular if in the vestibular system (including the vestibular areas of the cerebral cortex).

=== Exogenous substances (metabolic ataxia) ===
Exogenous substances that cause ataxia mainly do so because they have a depressant effect on central nervous system function. The most common example is ethanol (alcohol), which is capable of causing reversible cerebellar and vestibular ataxia. Chronic intake of ethanol causes atrophy of the cerebellum by oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stresses induced by thiamine deficiency.

Other examples include various prescription drugs (e.g. most antiepileptic drugs have cerebellar ataxia as a possible adverse effect), Lithium level over 1.5mEq/L, synthetic cannabinoid HU-211 ingestion and various other medical and recreational drugs (e.g. ketamine, PCP or dextromethorphan, all of which are NMDA receptor antagonists that produce a dissociative state at high doses). A further class of pharmaceuticals which can cause short term ataxia, especially in high doses, are benzodiazepines. Exposure to high levels of methylmercury, through consumption of fish with high mercury concentrations, is also a known cause of ataxia and other neurological disorders.

=== Radiation poisoning ===
Ataxia can be induced as a result of severe acute radiation poisoning with an absorbed dose of more than 30 grays. Furthermore, those with ataxia telangiectasia may have a high sensitivity towards gamma rays and x-rays.

=== Vitamin B12 deficiency ===
Vitamin B12 deficiency may cause, among several neurological abnormalities, overlapping cerebellar and sensory ataxia. Neuropsychological symptoms may include sense loss, difficulty in proprioception, poor balance, loss of sensation in the feet, changes in reflexes, dementia, and psychosis, which can be reversible with treatment. Complications may include a neurological complex known as subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord, and other neurological disorders.

=== Hypothyroidism ===
Symptoms of neurological dysfunction may be the presenting feature in some patients with hypothyroidism. These include reversible cerebellar ataxia, dementia, peripheral neuropathy, psychosis and coma. Most of the neurological complications improve completely after thyroid hormone replacement therapy.

=== Causes of isolated sensory ataxia ===
Peripheral neuropathies may cause generalised or localised sensory ataxia (e.g. a limb only) depending on the extent of the neuropathic involvement. Spinal disorders of various types may cause sensory ataxia from the lesioned level below, when they involve the dorsal columns.

=== Non-hereditary cerebellar degeneration ===
Non-hereditary causes of cerebellar degeneration include chronic alcohol use disorder, head injury, paraneoplastic and non-paraneoplastic autoimmune ataxia, high-altitude cerebral edema, celiac disease, normal-pressure hydrocephalus, and infectious or post-infectious cerebellitis.

=== Hereditary ataxias ===
Ataxia may depend on hereditary disorders consisting of degeneration of the cerebellum or of the spine; most cases feature both to some extent, and therefore present with overlapping cerebellar and sensory ataxia, even though one is often more evident than the other. Hereditary disorders causing ataxia include autosomal dominant ones such as spinocerebellar ataxia, episodic ataxia, and dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy, as well as autosomal recessive disorders such as Friedreich&#x27;s ataxia (sensory and cerebellar, with the former predominating) and Niemann–Pick disease, ataxia–telangiectasia (sensory and cerebellar, with the latter predominating), autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia-14 and abetalipoproteinaemia. An example of X-linked ataxic condition is the rare fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome or FXTAS.

=== Arnold–Chiari malformation (congenital ataxia) ===
Arnold–Chiari malformation is a malformation of the brain. It consists of a downward displacement of the cerebellar tonsils and the medulla through the foramen magnum, sometimes causing hydrocephalus as a result of obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid outflow.

=== Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency ===
Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency is an autosomal-recessive gene disorder where mutations in the ALDH5A1 gene results in the accumulation of gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) in the body. GHB accumulates in the nervous system and can cause ataxia as well as other neurological dysfunction.

=== Wilson&#x27;s disease ===
Wilson&#x27;s disease is an autosomal-recessive gene disorder whereby an alteration of the ATP7B gene results in an inability to properly excrete copper from the body. Copper accumulates in the liver and raises the toxicity levels in the nervous system causing demyelination of the nerves. This can cause ataxia as well as other neurological and organ impairments.

=== Gluten ataxia ===

Gluten ataxia is an autoimmune disease derived from celiac disease, which is triggered by the ingestion of gluten. Early diagnosis and treatment with a gluten-free diet can improve ataxia and prevent its progression. The effectiveness of the treatment depends on the elapsed time from the onset of the ataxia until diagnosis, because the death of neurons in the cerebellum as a result of gluten exposure is irreversible. It accounts for 40% of ataxias of unknown origin and 15% of all ataxias. Less than 10% of people with gluten ataxia present any gastrointestinal symptom and only about 40% have intestinal damage. This entity is classified into primary auto-immune cerebellar ataxias (PACA). There is a continuum between presymptomatic ataxia and immune ataxias with clinical deficits.

=== Potassium pump ===
Malfunction of the sodium-potassium pump may be a factor in some ataxias. The - pump has been shown to control and set the intrinsic activity mode of cerebellar Purkinje neurons. This suggests that the pump might not simply be a homeostatic, &quot;housekeeping&quot; molecule for ionic gradients; but could be a computational element in the cerebellum and the brain. Indeed, an ouabain block of - pumps in the cerebellum of a live mouse results in it displaying ataxia and dystonia. Ataxia is observed for lower ouabain concentrations, dystonia is observed at higher ouabain concentrations.

=== Cerebellar ataxia associated with anti-GAD antibodies ===
Antibodies against the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD: enzyme changing glutamate into GABA) cause cerebellar deficits. The antibodies impair motor learning and cause behavioral deficits.
GAD antibodies related ataxia is part of the group called immune-mediated cerebellar ataxias. The antibodies induce a synaptopathy. The cerebellum is particularly vulnerable to autoimmune disorders. Cerebellar circuitry has capacities to compensate and restore function thanks to cerebellar reserve, gathering multiple forms of plasticity. LTDpathies gather immune disorders targeting long-term depression (LTD), a form of plasticity.

== Diagnosis ==
* Imaging studies – A CT scan or MRI of the brain might help determine potential causes. An MRI can sometimes show shrinkage of the cerebellum and other brain structures in people with ataxia. It may also show other treatable findings, such as a blood clot or benign tumour, that could be pressing on the cerebellum.
* Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) – A needle is inserted into the lower back (lumbar region) between two lumbar vertebrae to obtain a sample of cerebrospinal fluid for testing.
* Genetic testing – Determines whether the mutation that causes one of the hereditary ataxic conditions is present. Tests are available for many but not all of the hereditary ataxias.

== Treatment ==
The treatment of ataxia and its effectiveness depend on the underlying cause. Treatment may limit or reduce the effects of ataxia, but it is unlikely to eliminate them entirely. Recovery tends to be better in individuals with a single focal injury (such as stroke or a benign tumour), compared to those who have a neurological degenerative condition. A review of the management of degenerative ataxia was published in 2009. A small number of rare conditions presenting with prominent cerebellar ataxia are amenable to specific treatment and recognition of these disorders is critical. Diseases include vitamin E deficiency, abetalipoproteinemia, cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, Niemann–Pick type C disease, Refsum&#x27;s disease, glucose transporter type 1 deficiency, episodic ataxia type 2, gluten ataxia, glutamic acid decarboxylase ataxia. Novel therapies target the RNA defects associated with cerebellar disorders, using in particular anti-sense oligonucleotides.

The movement disorders associated with ataxia can be managed by pharmacological treatments and through physical therapy and occupational therapy to reduce disability. Some drug treatments that have been used to control ataxia include: 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), idebenone, amantadine, physostigmine, L-carnitine or derivatives, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, vigabatrin, phosphatidylcholine, acetazolamide, 4-aminopyridine, buspirone, and a combination of coenzyme Q10 and vitamin E.

Physical therapy requires a focus on adapting activity and facilitating motor learning for retraining specific functional motor patterns. A recent systematic review suggested that physical therapy is effective, but there is only moderate evidence to support this conclusion. The most commonly used physical therapy interventions for cerebellar ataxia are vestibular habituation, Frenkel exercises, proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF), and balance training; however, therapy is often highly individualized and gait and coordination training are large components of therapy.

Current research suggests that, if a person is able to walk with or without a mobility aid, physical therapy should include an exercise program addressing five components: static balance, dynamic balance, trunk-limb coordination, stairs, and contracture prevention. Once the physical therapist determines that the individual is able to safely perform parts of the program independently, it is important that the individual be prescribed and regularly engage in a supplementary home exercise program that incorporates these components to further improve long term outcomes. These outcomes include balance tasks, gait, and individual activities of daily living. While the improvements are attributed primarily to changes in the brain and not just the hip or ankle joints, it is still unknown whether the improvements are due to adaptations in the cerebellum or compensation by other areas of the brain.

Decomposition, simplification, or slowing of multijoint movement may also be an effective strategy that therapists may use to improve function in patients with ataxia. Training likely needs to be intense and focused—as indicated by one study performed with stroke patients experiencing limb ataxia who underwent intensive upper limb retraining. Their therapy consisted of constraint-induced movement therapy which resulted in improvements of their arm function. Treatment should likely include strategies to manage difficulties with everyday activities such as walking. Gait aids (such as a cane or walker) can be provided to decrease the risk of falls associated with impairment of balance or poor coordination. Severe ataxia may eventually lead to the need for a wheelchair. To obtain better results, possible coexisting motor deficits need to be addressed in addition to those induced by ataxia. For example, muscle weakness and decreased endurance could lead to increasing fatigue and poorer movement patterns.

There are several assessment tools available to therapists and health care professionals working with patients with ataxia. The International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) is one of the most widely used and has been proven to have very high reliability and validity. Other tools that assess motor function, balance and coordination are also highly valuable to help the therapist track the progress of their patient, as well as to quantify the patient&#x27;s functionality. These tests include, but are not limited to:
* The Berg Balance Scale
* Tandem Walking (to test for Tandem gaitability)
* Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA)
* tapping tests – The person must quickly and repeatedly tap their arm or leg while the therapist monitors the amount of dysdiadochokinesia.
* finger-nose testing – This test has several variations including finger-to-therapist&#x27;s finger, finger-to-finger, and alternate nose-to-finger.

== Other uses ==
The term &quot;ataxia&quot; is sometimes used in a broader sense to indicate lack of coordination in some physiological process. Examples include optic ataxia (lack of coordination between visual inputs and hand movements, resulting in inability to reach and grab objects) and ataxic respiration (lack of coordination in respiratory movements, usually due to dysfunction of the respiratory centres in the medulla oblongata).

Optic ataxia may be caused by lesions to the posterior parietal cortex, which is responsible for combining and expressing positional information and relating it to movement. Outputs of the posterior parietal cortex include the spinal cord, brain stem motor pathways, pre-motor and pre-frontal cortex, basal ganglia and the cerebellum. Some neurons in the posterior parietal cortex are modulated by intention. Optic ataxia is usually part of Balint&#x27;s syndrome, but can be seen in isolation with injuries to the superior parietal lobule, as it represents a disconnection between visual-association cortex and the frontal premotor and motor cortex.

<text>Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (&quot;née&quot; Byron; 10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852), also known as Ada Lovelace, was an English mathematician and writer chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage&#x27;s proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation.

Lovelace was the only legitimate child of poet Lord Byron and reformer Anne Isabella Milbanke. All her half-siblings, Lord Byron&#x27;s other children, were born out of wedlock to other women. Lord Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and left England forever. He died in Greece when she was eight. Lady Byron was anxious about her daughter&#x27;s upbringing and promoted Lovelace&#x27;s interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her father&#x27;s perceived insanity. Despite this, Lovelace remained interested in her father, naming her two sons Byron and Gordon. Upon her death, she was buried next to her father at her request. Although often ill in her childhood, Lovelace pursued her studies assiduously. She married William King in 1835. King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838, Ada thereby becoming Countess of Lovelace.

Lovelace&#x27;s educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as Andrew Crosse, Charles Babbage, Sir David Brewster, Charles Wheatstone and Michael Faraday, and the author Charles Dickens, contacts which she used to further her education. Lovelace described her approach as &quot;poetical science&quot; and herself as an &quot;Analyst (&amp; Metaphysician)&quot;.

When she was eighteen, Lovelace&#x27;s mathematical talents led her to a long working relationship and friendship with fellow British mathematician Charles Babbage, who is known as &quot;the father of computers&quot;. She was in particular interested in Babbage&#x27;s work on the Analytical Engine. Lovelace first met him on 5 June 1833, when she and her mother attended one of Charles Babbage&#x27;s Saturday night soirées with their mutual friend, and Lovelace&#x27;s private tutor, Mary Somerville.

Between 1842 and 1843, Lovelace translated by the military engineer Luigi Menabrea (later Prime Minister of Italy) about the Analytical Engine, supplementing it with . 
Lovelace&#x27;s notes are important in the early history of computers, especially since the seventh one contained what many consider to be the first computer program—that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine. Other historians reject this perspective and point out that Babbage&#x27;s personal notes from 1837 to 1840 contain the first programs for the engine. She also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching, while many others, including Babbage himself, focused only on those capabilities. Her mindset of &quot;poetical science&quot; led her to ask questions about the Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes), examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool. The programming language Ada is named after her.

==Biography==
===Childhood===
Lord Byron expected his child to be a &quot;glorious boy&quot; and was disappointed when Lady Byron gave birth to a girl. The child was named after Byron&#x27;s half-sister, Augusta Leigh, and was called &quot;Ada&quot; by Byron himself. On 16 January 1816, at Lord Byron&#x27;s command, Lady Byron left for her parents&#x27; home at Kirkby Mallory, taking their five-week-old daughter with her. Although English law at the time granted full custody of children to the father in cases of separation, Lord Byron made no attempt to claim his parental rights, but did request that his sister keep him informed of Ada&#x27;s welfare.

On 21 April, Lord Byron signed the deed of separation, although very reluctantly, and left England for good a few days later. Aside from an acrimonious separation, Lady Byron continued throughout her life to make allegations about her husband&#x27;s immoral behaviour. This set of events made Lovelace infamous in Victorian society. Ada did not have a relationship with her father. He died in 1824 when she was eight years old. Her mother was the only significant parental figure in her life. Lovelace was not shown the family portrait of her father until her 20th birthday.

Lovelace did not have a close relationship with her mother. She was often left in the care of her maternal grandmother Judith, Hon. Lady Milbanke, who doted on her. However, because of societal attitudes of the time—which favoured the husband in any separation, with the welfare of any child acting as mitigation—Lady Byron had to present herself as a loving mother to the rest of society. This included writing anxious letters to Lady Milbanke about her daughter&#x27;s welfare, with a cover note saying to retain the letters in case she had to use them to show maternal concern. In one letter to Lady Milbanke, she referred to her daughter as &quot;it&quot;: &quot;I talk to it for your satisfaction, not my own, and shall be very glad when you have it under your own.&quot; Lady Byron had her teenage daughter watched by close friends for any sign of moral deviation. Lovelace dubbed these observers the &quot;Furies&quot; and later complained they exaggerated and invented stories about her.

Lovelace was often ill, beginning in early childhood. At the age of eight, she experienced headaches that obscured her vision. In June 1829, she was paralyzed after a bout of measles. She was subjected to continuous bed rest for nearly a year, something which may have extended her period of disability. By 1831, she was able to walk with crutches. Despite the illnesses, she developed her mathematical and technological skills.

Ada Byron had an affair with a tutor in early 1833. She tried to elope with him after she was caught, but the tutor&#x27;s relatives recognised her and contacted her mother. Lady Byron and her friends covered the incident up to prevent a public scandal. Lovelace never met her younger half-sister, Allegra, the daughter of Lord Byron and Claire Clairmont. Allegra died in 1822 at the age of five. Lovelace did have some contact with Elizabeth Medora Leigh, the daughter of Byron&#x27;s half-sister Augusta Leigh, who purposely avoided Lovelace as much as possible when introduced at court.

===Adult years===
Lovelace became close friends with her tutor Mary Somerville, who introduced her to Charles Babbage in 1833. She had a strong respect and affection for Somerville, and they corresponded for many years. Other acquaintances included the scientists Andrew Crosse, Sir David Brewster, Charles Wheatstone, Michael Faraday and the author Charles Dickens. She was presented at Court at the age of seventeen &quot;and became a popular belle of the season&quot; in part because of her &quot;brilliant mind&quot;. By 1834 Ada was a regular at Court and started attending various events. She danced often and was able to charm many people, and was described by most people as being dainty, although John Hobhouse, Byron&#x27;s friend, described her as &quot;a large, coarse-skinned young woman but with something of my friend&#x27;s features, particularly the mouth&quot;. This description followed their meeting on 24 February 1834 in which Ada made it clear to Hobhouse that she did not like him, probably due to her mother&#x27;s influence, which led her to dislike all of her father&#x27;s friends. This first impression was not to last, and they later became friends.

On 8 July 1835, she married William, 8th Baron King, becoming Lady King. They had three homes: Ockham Park, Surrey; a Scottish estate on Loch Torridon in Ross-shire; and a house in London. They spent their honeymoon at Ashley Combe near Porlock Weir, Somerset, which had been built as a hunting lodge in 1799 and was improved by King in preparation for their honeymoon. It later became their summer retreat and was further improved during this time. From 1845, the family&#x27;s main house was Horsley Towers, built in the Tudorbethan fashion by the architect of the Houses of Parliament, Charles Barry, and later greatly enlarged to Lovelace&#x27;s own designs.

They had three children: Byron (born 1836); Anne Isabella (called Annabella, born 1837); and Ralph Gordon (born 1839). Immediately after the birth of Annabella, Lady King experienced &quot;a tedious and suffering illness, which took months to cure&quot;. Ada was a descendant of the extinct Barons Lovelace and in 1838, her husband was made Earl of Lovelace and Viscount Ockham, meaning Ada became the Countess of Lovelace. In 1843–44, Ada&#x27;s mother assigned William Benjamin Carpenter to teach Ada&#x27;s children and to act as a &quot;moral&quot; instructor for Ada. He quickly fell for her and encouraged her to express any frustrated affections, claiming that his marriage meant he would never act in an &quot;unbecoming&quot; manner. When it became clear that Carpenter was trying to start an affair, Ada cut it off.

In 1841, Lovelace and Medora Leigh (the daughter of Lord Byron&#x27;s half-sister Augusta Leigh) were told by Ada&#x27;s mother that Ada&#x27;s father was also Medora&#x27;s father. On 27 February 1841, Ada wrote to her mother: &quot;I am not in the least &quot;astonished&quot;. In fact, you merely &quot;confirm&quot; what I have for &quot;years and years&quot; felt scarcely a doubt about, but should have considered it most improper in me to hint to you that I in any way suspected.&quot; She did not blame the incestuous relationship on Byron, but instead blamed Augusta Leigh: &quot;I fear she is more inherently wicked than he ever was.&quot; In the 1840s, Ada flirted with scandals: firstly, from a relaxed approach to extra-marital relationships with men, leading to rumours of affairs; and secondly, from her love of gambling. She apparently lost more than £3,000 on the horses during the later 1840s. The gambling led to her forming a syndicate with male friends, and an ambitious attempt in 1851 to create a mathematical model for successful large bets. This went disastrously wrong, leaving her thousands of pounds in debt to the syndicate, forcing her to admit it all to her husband. She had a shadowy relationship with Andrew Crosse&#x27;s son John from 1844 onwards. John Crosse destroyed most of their correspondence after her death as part of a legal agreement. She bequeathed him the only heirlooms her father had personally left to her. During her final illness, she would panic at the idea of the younger Crosse being kept from visiting her.

===Education===

From 1832, when she was seventeen, her mathematical abilities began to emerge, and her interest in mathematics dominated the majority of her adult life. Her mother&#x27;s obsession with rooting out any of the insanity of which she accused Byron was one of the reasons that Ada was taught mathematics from an early age. She was privately educated in mathematics and science by William Frend, William King, and Mary Somerville, the noted 19th-century researcher and scientific author. In the 1840s, the mathematician Augustus De Morgan extended her &quot;much help in her mathematical studies&quot; including study of advanced calculus topics including the &quot;numbers of Bernoulli&quot; (that formed her celebrated algorithm for Babbage&#x27;s Analytical Engine). In a letter to Lady Byron, De Morgan suggested that Ada&#x27;s skill in mathematics might lead her to become &quot;an original mathematical investigator, perhaps of first-rate eminence&quot;.

Lovelace often questioned basic assumptions through integrating poetry and science. Whilst studying differential calculus, she wrote to De Morgan:

I may remark that the curious transformations many formulae can undergo, the unsuspected and to a beginner apparently impossible identity of forms exceedingly dissimilar at first sight, is I think one of the chief difficulties in the early part of mathematical studies. I am often reminded of certain sprites and fairies one reads of, who are at one&#x27;s elbows in &quot;one&quot; shape now, and the next minute in a form most dissimilar.

Lovelace believed that intuition and imagination were critical to effectively applying mathematical and scientific concepts. She valued metaphysics as much as mathematics, viewing both as tools for exploring &quot;the unseen worlds around us&quot;.

===Death===
Lovelace died at the age of 36 on 27 November 1852, from uterine cancer. The illness lasted several months, in which time Annabella took command over whom Ada saw, and excluded all of her friends and confidants. Under her mother&#x27;s influence, Ada had a religious transformation and was coaxed into repenting of her previous conduct and making Annabella her executor. She lost contact with her husband after confessing something to him on 30 August which caused him to abandon her bedside. It is not known what she told him. She was buried, at her request, next to her father at the Church of St. Mary Magdalene in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire.

==Work==
Throughout her life, Lovelace was strongly interested in scientific developments and fads of the day, including phrenology and mesmerism. After her work with Babbage, Lovelace continued to work on other projects. In 1844, she commented to a friend Woronzow Greig about her desire to create a mathematical model for how the brain gives rise to thoughts and nerves to feelings (&quot;a calculus of the nervous system&quot;). She never achieved this, however. In part, her interest in the brain came from a long-running preoccupation, inherited from her mother, about her &quot;potential&quot; madness. As part of her research into this project, she visited the electrical engineer Andrew Crosse in 1844 to learn how to carry out electrical experiments. In the same year, she wrote a review of a paper by Baron Karl von Reichenbach, &quot;Researches on Magnetism&quot;, but this was not published and does not appear to have progressed past the first draft. In 1851, the year before her cancer struck, she wrote to her mother mentioning &quot;certain productions&quot; she was working on regarding the relation of maths and music.

Lovelace first met Charles Babbage in June 1833, through their mutual friend Mary Somerville. Later that month, Babbage invited Lovelace to see the prototype for his difference engine. She became fascinated with the machine and used her relationship with Somerville to visit Babbage as often as she could. Babbage was impressed by Lovelace&#x27;s intellect and analytic skills. He called her &quot;The Enchantress of Number&quot;. In 1843, he wrote to her:


During a nine-month period in 1842–43, Lovelace translated the Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea&#x27;s article on Babbage&#x27;s newest proposed machine, the Analytical Engine. With the article, she appended a set of notes. Explaining the Analytical Engine&#x27;s function was a difficult task; many other scientists did not grasp the concept and the British establishment had shown little interest in it. Lovelace&#x27;s notes even had to explain how the Analytical Engine differed from the original Difference Engine. Her work was well received at the time; the scientist Michael Faraday described himself as a supporter of her writing.

The notes are around three times longer than the article itself and include (in &quot;Note G&quot;), in complete detail, a method for calculating a sequence of Bernoulli numbers using the Analytical Engine, which might have run correctly had it ever been built (only Babbage&#x27;s Difference Engine has been built, completed in London in 2002). Based on this work, Lovelace is now considered by many to be the first computer programmer and her method has been called the world&#x27;s first computer program. 

&quot;Note G&quot; also contains Lovelace&#x27;s dismissal of artificial intelligence. She wrote that &quot;The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to &quot;originate&quot; anything. It can do &quot;whatever we know how to order it&quot; to perform. It can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths.&quot; This objection has been the subject of much debate and rebuttal, for example by Alan Turing in his paper &quot;Computing Machinery and Intelligence&quot;. Most modern computer scientists argue that this view is outdated and that computer software can develop in ways that cannot necessarily be anticipated by programmers.

Lovelace and Babbage had a minor falling out when the papers were published, when he tried to leave his own statement (criticising the government&#x27;s treatment of his Engine) as an unsigned preface, which could have been mistakenly interpreted as a joint declaration. When Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Scientific Memoirs&quot; ruled that the statement should be signed, Babbage wrote to Lovelace asking her to withdraw the paper. This was the first that she knew he was leaving it unsigned, and she wrote back refusing to withdraw the paper. The historian Benjamin Woolley theorised that &quot;His actions suggested he had so enthusiastically sought Ada&#x27;s involvement, and so happily indulged her ... because of her &#x27;celebrated name&#x27;.&quot; Their friendship recovered, and they continued to correspond. On 12 August 1851, when she was dying of cancer, Lovelace wrote to him asking him to be her executor, though this letter did not give him the necessary legal authority. Part of the terrace at Worthy Manor was known as &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Walk;&quot; it was there that Lovelace and Babbage were reputed to have walked while discussing mathematical principles.

===First published computer program===
In 1840, Babbage was invited to give a seminar at the University of Turin about his Analytical Engine. Luigi Menabrea, a young Italian engineer and the future Prime Minister of Italy, transcribed Babbage&#x27;s lecture into French, and this transcript was subsequently published in the &quot;Bibliothèque universelle de Genève&quot; in October 1842.
Babbage&#x27;s friend Charles Wheatstone commissioned Ada Lovelace to translate Menabrea&#x27;s paper into English. She then augmented the paper with notes, which were added to the translation. Ada Lovelace spent the better part of a year doing this, assisted with input from Babbage. These notes, which are more extensive than Menabrea&#x27;s paper, were then published in the September 1843 edition of Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Scientific Memoirs&quot; under the initialism &quot;AAL&quot;.

Ada Lovelace&#x27;s notes were labelled alphabetically from A to G. In Note G, she describes an algorithm for the Analytical Engine to compute Bernoulli numbers. It is considered to be the first published algorithm ever specifically tailored for implementation on a computer, and Ada Lovelace has often been cited as the first computer programmer for this reason. The engine was never completed and so her program was never tested.

In 1953, more than a century after her death, Ada Lovelace&#x27;s notes on Babbage&#x27;s Analytical Engine were republished as an appendix to B. V. Bowden&#x27;s &quot;Faster than Thought: A Symposium on Digital Computing Machines&quot;. The engine has now been recognised as an early model for a computer and her notes as a description of a computer and software.

===Insight into potential of computing devices===

In her notes, Ada Lovelace emphasised the difference between the Analytical Engine and previous calculating machines, particularly its ability to be programmed to solve problems of any complexity. She realised the potential of the device extended far beyond mere number crunching. In her notes, she wrote:

This analysis was an important development from previous ideas about the capabilities of computing devices and anticipated the implications of modern computing one hundred years before they were realised. Walter Isaacson ascribes Ada&#x27;s insight regarding the application of computing to &quot;any&quot; process based on logical symbols to an observation about textiles: &quot;When she saw some mechanical looms that used punchcards to direct the weaving of beautiful patterns, it reminded her of how Babbage&#x27;s engine used punched cards to make calculations.&quot; This insight is seen as significant by writers such as Betty Toole and Benjamin Woolley, as well as the programmer John Graham-Cumming, whose project Plan 28 has the aim of constructing the first complete Analytical Engine.

According to the historian of computing and Babbage specialist Doron Swade:

Ada saw something that Babbage in some sense failed to see. In Babbage&#x27;s world his engines were bound by number...What Lovelace saw...was that number could represent entities other than quantity. So once you had a machine for manipulating numbers, if those numbers represented other things, letters, musical notes, then the machine could manipulate symbols of which number was one instance, according to rules. It is this fundamental transition from a machine which is a number cruncher to a machine for manipulating symbols according to rules that is the fundamental transition from calculation to computation—to general-purpose computation—and looking back from the present high ground of modern computing, if we are looking and sifting history for that transition, then that transition was made explicitly by Ada in that 1843 paper.

===Distinction between mechanism and logical structure===
Lovelace recognized the difference between the details of the computing mechanism, as covered in an 1834 article on the Difference Engine,
and the logical structure of the Analytical Engine, on which the article she was reviewing dwelt. She noted that different specialists might be required in each area.

The [1834 article] chiefly treats it under its mechanical aspect, entering but slightly into the mathematical principles of which that engine is the representative, but giving, in considerable length, many details of the mechanism and contrivances by means of which it tabulates the various orders of differences. M. Menabrea, on the contrary, exclusively developes the analytical view; taking it for granted that mechanism is able to perform certain processes, but without attempting to explain how; and devoting his whole attention to explanations and illustrations of the manner in which analytical laws can be so arranged and combined as to bring every branch of that vast subject within the grasp of the assumed powers of mechanism. It is obvious that, in the invention of a calculating engine, these two branches of the subject are equally essential fields of investigation... They are indissolubly connected, though so different in their intrinsic nature, that perhaps the same mind might not be likely to prove equally profound or successful in both.
===Controversy over contribution===
Though Lovelace is often referred to as the first computer programmer, some biographers, computer scientists and historians of computing suggest otherwise.

Allan G. Bromley, in the 1990 article &quot;Difference and Analytical Engines&quot;:
Bruce Collier wrote that Lovelace &quot;made a considerable contribution to publicizing the Analytical Engine, but there is no evidence that she advanced the design or theory of it in any way&quot;.

Eugene Eric Kim and Betty Alexandra Toole consider it &quot;incorrect&quot; to regard Lovelace as the first computer programmer, as Babbage wrote the initial programs for his Analytical Engine, although the majority were never published. Bromley notes several dozen sample programs prepared by Babbage between 1837 and 1840, all substantially predating Lovelace&#x27;s notes. Dorothy K. Stein regards Lovelace&#x27;s notes as &quot;more a reflection of the mathematical uncertainty of the author, the political purposes of the inventor, and, above all, of the social and cultural context in which it was written, than a blueprint for a scientific development&quot;.

Doron Swade has said that Ada only published the first computer program instead of actually writing it, but agrees that she was the only person to see the potential of the analytical engine as a machine capable of expressing entities other than quantities.

In his book, &quot;Idea Makers&quot;, Stephen Wolfram defends Lovelace&#x27;s contributions. While acknowledging that Babbage wrote several unpublished algorithms for the Analytical Engine prior to Lovelace&#x27;s notes, Wolfram argues that &quot;there&#x27;s nothing as sophisticated—or as clean—as Ada&#x27;s computation of the Bernoulli numbers. Babbage certainly helped and commented on Ada&#x27;s work, but she was definitely the driver of it.&quot; Wolfram then suggests that Lovelace&#x27;s main achievement was to distill from Babbage&#x27;s correspondence &quot;a clear exposition of the abstract operation of the machine—something which Babbage never did&quot;.

==Commemoration==
The computer language Ada, created on behalf of the United States Department of Defense, was named after Lovelace. The reference manual for the language was approved on 10 December 1980 and the Department of Defense Military Standard for the language, &quot;MIL-STD-1815&quot;, was given the number of the year of her birth.

In 1981, the Association for Women in Computing inaugurated its Ada Lovelace Award. , the British Computer Society (BCS) has awarded the Lovelace Medal, and in 2008 initiated an annual competition for women students. BCSWomen sponsors the Lovelace Colloquium, an annual conference for women undergraduates. Ada College is a further-education college in Tottenham Hale, London, focused on digital skills.

Ada Lovelace Day is an annual event celebrated on the second Tuesday of October, which began in 2009. Its goal is to &quot;... raise the profile of women in science, technology, engineering, and maths,&quot; and to &quot;create new role models for girls and women&quot; in these fields.

The Ada Initiative was a non-profit organisation dedicated to increasing the involvement of women in the free culture and open source movements. A specialist technical college, for pupils aged 16–19, in England is named &quot;Ada, the National College for Digital Skills&quot;, it has campuses in Whitechapel, Tottenham Hale and Manchester. The building of the department of Engineering Mathematics at the University of Bristol is called the Ada Lovelace Building. The Engineering in Computer Science and Telecommunications College building in Zaragoza University is called the Ada Byron Building. The computer centre in the village of Porlock, near where Lovelace lived, is named after her. Ada Lovelace House is a council-owned building in Kirkby-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, near where Lovelace spent her infancy.

In 2012, a Google Doodle and blog post honoured her on her birthday. In 2013, Ada Developers Academy was founded and named after her. Its mission is to diversify tech by providing women and gender-diverse people the skills, experience, and community support to become professional software developers to change the face of tech. On 17 September 2013, the BBC Radio 4 biography programme &quot;Great Lives&quot; devoted an episode to Ada Lovelace; she was sponsored by TV presenter Konnie Huq.

As of November 2015, all new British passports have included an illustration of Lovelace and Babbage. In 2017, a Google Doodle honoured her with other women on International Women&#x27;s Day. On 2 February 2018, Satellogic, a high-resolution Earth observation imaging and analytics company, launched a ÑuSat type micro-satellite named in honour of Ada Lovelace. In March 2018, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a belated obituary for Ada Lovelace.

On 27 July 2018, Senator Ron Wyden submitted, in the United States Senate, the designation of 9 October 2018 as National Ada Lovelace Day: &quot;To honor the life and contributions of Ada Lovelace as a leading woman in science and mathematics&quot;. The resolution (S.Res.592) was considered, and agreed to without amendment and with a preamble by unanimous consent. In November 2020 it was announced that Trinity College Dublin, whose library had previously held forty busts, all of them of men, was commissioning four new busts of women, one of whom was to be Lovelace.

In March 2022, a statue of Ada Lovelace was installed at the site of the former Ergon House in the City of Westminster, London, honoring its scientific history. The redevelopment was part of a complex with Imperial Chemical House. The statue was sculpted by Etienne and Mary Millner and based on the portrait by Margaret Sarah Carpenter. The sculpture was unveiled on International Women&#x27;s Day, 2022. It stands on the 7th floor of Millbank Quarter overlooking the junction of Dean Bradley Street and Horseferry Road.

In September 2022, Nvidia announced the Ada Lovelace graphics processing unit (GPU) microarchitecture. In July 2023, the Royal Mint issued four commemorative £2 coins in various metals to &quot;honour the innovative contributions of computer science visionary Ada Lovelace and her legacy as a female trailblazer.&quot;

===Bicentenary (2015)===
The bicentenary of Ada Lovelace&#x27;s birth was celebrated with a number of events, including:

* &quot;The Ada Lovelace Bicentenary Lectures on Computability&quot;, Israel Institute for Advanced Studies, 20 December 2015 – 31 January 2016.
* &quot;Ada Lovelace Symposium&quot;, University of Oxford, 13–14 October 2015.
*&quot;Ada.Ada.Ada&quot;, a one-woman show about the life and work of Ada Lovelace (using an LED dress), premiered at Edinburgh International Science Festival on 11 April 2015, and continued to touring internationally to promote diversity on STEM at technology conferences, businesses, government and educational organisations.

Special exhibitions were displayed by the Science Museum in London, England and the Weston Library (part of the Bodleian Library) in Oxford, England.

==In popular culture==
===Novels and plays===

Lovelace is portrayed in Romulus Linney&#x27;s 1977 play &quot;Childe Byron&quot;. In Tom Stoppard&#x27;s 1993 play &quot;Arcadia&quot;, the precocious teenage genius Thomasina Coverly—a character &quot;apparently based&quot; on Ada Lovelace (the play also involves Lord Byron)—comes to understand chaos theory, and theorises the second law of thermodynamics, before either is officially recognised.

In the 1990 steampunk novel &quot;The Difference Engine&quot; by William Gibson and Bruce Sterling, Lovelace delivers a lecture on the &quot;punched cards&quot; programme which proves Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems decades before their actual discovery. Lovelace and Mary Shelley as teenagers are the central characters in Jordan Stratford&#x27;s steampunk series, &quot;The Wollstonecraft Detective Agency&quot;.

Lovelace features in John Crowley&#x27;s 2005 novel, &quot;Lord Byron&#x27;s Novel: The Evening Land&quot;, as an unseen character whose personality is forcefully depicted in her annotations and anti-heroic efforts to archive her father&#x27;s lost novel.

The 2015 play &quot;Ada and the Engine&quot; by Lauren Gunderson portrays Lovelace and Charles Babbage in unrequited love, and it imagines a post-death meeting between Lovelace and her father. Lovelace and Babbage are also the main characters in Sydney Padua&#x27;s webcomic and graphic novel &quot;The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage&quot;. The comic features extensive footnotes on the history of Ada Lovelace, and many lines of dialogue are drawn from actual correspondence.

===Film and television===

In the 1997 film &quot;Conceiving Ada&quot;, a computer scientist obsessed with Ada finds a way of communicating with her in the past by means of &quot;undying information waves&quot;.

Lovelace, identified as Ada Augusta Byron, is portrayed by Lily Lesser in the second series of &quot;The Frankenstein Chronicles&quot; aired on ITV in 2017. She is employed as an &quot;analyst&quot; to provide the workings of a life-sized humanoid automaton. The brass workings of the machine are reminiscent of Babbage&#x27;s analytical engine. Her employment is described as keeping her occupied until she returns to her studies in advanced mathematics.

Lovelace and Babbage appear as characters in the second season of the ITV series &quot;Victoria&quot; (2017). Emerald Fennell portrays Lovelace in the episode, &quot;The Green-Eyed Monster.&quot;

&quot;Lovelace&quot; is the name of the operating system designed by the character Cameron Howe in &quot;Halt and Catch Fire&quot;, which aired on AMC in the US in 2015.

Lovelace features as a character in &quot;Spyfall, Part 2&quot;, the second episode of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, series 12, which first aired on BBC One on 5 January 2020. The character was portrayed by Sylvie Briggs, alongside characterisations of Charles Babbage and Noor Inayat Khan.

<doc id="980" wikidata="Q509002" url="?curid=980" title="August Derleth">
<text>August William Derleth (February 24, 1909 – July 4, 1971) was an American writer and anthologist. He was the first book publisher of the writings of H. P. Lovecraft. He made contributions to the Cthulhu Mythos and the cosmic horror genre and helped found the publisher Arkham House (which did much to bring supernatural fiction into print in hardcover in the US that had only been readily available in the UK). Derleth was also a leading American regional writer of his day, as well as prolific in several other genres, including historical fiction, poetry, detective fiction, science fiction, and biography. Notably, he created the fictional detective Solar Pons, a pastiche of Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes.

A 1938 Guggenheim Fellow, Derleth considered his most serious work to be the ambitious &quot;Sac Prairie Saga&quot;, a series of fiction, historical fiction, poetry, and non-fiction naturalist works designed to memorialize life in the Wisconsin he knew. Derleth can also be considered a pioneering naturalist and conservationist in his writing.

==Life==
The son of William Julius Derleth and Rose Louise Volk, Derleth grew up in Sauk City, Wisconsin. He was educated in local parochial and public high school. Derleth wrote his first fiction at age 13. He was interested most in reading, and he made three trips to the library a week. He would save his money to buy books (his personal library exceeded 12,000 volumes later on in life). Some of his biggest influences were Ralph Waldo Emerson&#x27;s essays, Walt Whitman, H. L. Mencken&#x27;s &quot;The American Mercury&quot;, Samuel Johnson&#x27;s &quot;The History of Rasselas, Prince of Abissinia&quot;, Alexandre Dumas, Edgar Allan Poe, Walter Scott, and Henry David Thoreau&#x27;s Walden.

Forty rejected stories and three years later, according to anthologist Jim Stephens, he sold his first story, &quot;Bat&#x27;s Belfry&quot;, to &quot;Weird Tales&quot; magazine in 1926. Derleth wrote throughout his four years at the University of Wisconsin, where he received a B.A. in 1930. During this time he also served briefly as associate editor of Minneapolis-based Fawcett Publications &quot;Mystic Magazine&quot;.

Returning to Sauk City in the summer of 1931, Derleth worked in a local canning factory and collaborated with childhood friend Mark Schorer (later Chairman of the University of California, Berkeley English Department). They rented a cabin, writing Gothic and other horror stories and selling them
to &quot;Weird Tales&quot; magazine. Derleth won a place on the O&#x27;Brien Roll of Honor for &quot;Five Alone&quot;, published in &quot;Place of Hawks&quot;, but was first published in &quot;Pagany&quot; magazine.

As a result of his early work on the &quot;Sac Prairie Saga&quot;, Derleth was awarded the prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship; his sponsors were Helen C. White, Nobel Prize-winning novelist Sinclair Lewis and poet Edgar Lee Masters of &quot;Spoon River Anthology&quot; fame.

In the mid-1930s, Derleth organized a Ranger&#x27;s Club for young people, served as clerk and president of the local school board, served as a parole officer, organized a local men&#x27;s club and a parent-teacher association. He also lectured in American regional literature at the University of Wisconsin and was a contributing editor of &quot;Outdoors Magazine&quot;.

With longtime friend Donald Wandrei, Derleth founded Arkham House in 1939. Its initial objective was to publish the works of H. P. Lovecraft, with whom Derleth had corresponded since his teenage years. At the same time, he began teaching a course in American Regional Literature at the University of Wisconsin.

In 1941, he became literary editor of &quot;The Capital Times&quot; newspaper in Madison, a post he held until his resignation in 1960. His hobbies included fencing, swimming, chess, philately and comic-strips (Derleth reportedly used the funding from his Guggenheim Fellowship to bind his comic book collection, most recently valued in the millions of dollars, rather than to travel abroad as the award intended.). Derleth&#x27;s true avocation, however, was hiking the terrain of his native Wisconsin lands, and observing and recording nature with an expert eye.

Derleth once wrote of his writing methods, &quot;I write very swiftly, from 750,000 to a million words yearly, very little of it pulp material.&quot;

In 1948, he was elected president of the Associated Fantasy Publishers at the 6th World Science Fiction Convention in Toronto.

He was married April 6, 1953, to Sandra Evelyn Winters. They divorced six years later. Derleth retained custody of the couple&#x27;s two children, April Rose Derleth and Walden William Derleth. April earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in English from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1977. She became majority stockholder, President, and CEO of Arkham House in 1994. She remained in that capacity until her death. She was known in the community as a naturalist and humanitarian. April died on March 21, 2011.

In 1960, Derleth began editing and publishing a magazine called &quot;Hawk and Whippoorwill&quot;, dedicated to poems of man and nature.

Derleth died of a heart attack on July 4, 1971, and is buried in St. Aloysius Cemetery in Sauk City. The U.S. 12 bridge over the Wisconsin River is named in his honor. Derleth was Roman Catholic.

In Derleth&#x27;s biography, Dorothy M. Grobe Litersky stated that Derleth was bisexual, and maintained long-term romantic relationships with both men and women. This assertion has not been verified; no names were given of these romantic partners (in the interest of privacy according to Litersky), and no evidence or acknowledgement of Derleth having a bisexual or homosexual orientation has ever been found in his personal correspondence.

==Career==
Derleth wrote more than 150 short stories and more than 100 books during his lifetime.
===The &quot;Sac Prairie Saga&quot;===
Derleth wrote an expansive series of novels, short stories, journals, poems, and other works about Sac Prairie. Derleth intended this series to comprise up to 50 novels telling the projected life-story of the region from the 19th century onwards, with analogies to Balzac&#x27;s &quot;Human Comedy&quot; and Proust&#x27;s &quot;Remembrance of Things Past&quot;.

This, and other early work by Derleth, made him a well-known figure among the regional literary figures of his time: early Pulitzer Prize winners Hamlin Garland and Zona Gale, as well as Sinclair Lewis, the last both an admirer and critic of Derleth.

As Edward Wagenknecht wrote in &quot;Cavalcade of the American Novel&quot;, &quot;What Mr. Derleth has that is lacking...in modern novelists generally, is a country. He belongs. He writes of a land and a people that are bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh. In his fictional world, there is a unity much deeper and more fundamental than anything that can be conferred by an ideology. It is clear, too, that he did not get the best, and most fictionally useful, part of his background material from research in the library; like Scott, in his Border novels, he gives, rather, the impression of having drunk it in with his mother&#x27;s milk.&quot;

Jim Stephens, editor of &quot;An August Derleth Reader&quot;, (1992), argues: &quot;what Derleth accomplished...was to gather a Wisconsin mythos which gave respect to the ancient fundament of our contemporary life.&quot;

The author inaugurated the &quot;Sac Prairie Saga&quot; with four novellas comprising &quot;Place of Hawks&quot;, published by Loring &amp; Mussey in 1935. At publication, &quot;The Detroit News&quot; wrote: &quot;Certainly with this book Mr. Derleth may be added to the American writers of distinction.&quot;

Derleth&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Still is the Summer Night&quot;, was published two years later by the famous Charles Scribners&#x27; editor Maxwell Perkins, and was the second in his Sac Prairie Saga.

&quot;Village Year&quot;, the first in a series of journals – meditations on nature, Midwestern village American life, and more – was published in 1941 to praise from &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;: &quot;A book of instant sensitive responsiveness...recreates its scene with acuteness and beauty, and makes an unusual contribution to the Americana of the present day.&quot; The &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; observed that &quot;Derleth...deepens the value of his village setting by presenting in full the enduring natural background; with the people projected against this, the writing comes to have the quality of an old Flemish picture, humanity lively and amusing and loveable in the foreground and nature magnificent beyond.&quot; James Grey, writing in the &quot;St. Louis Dispatch&quot; concluded, &quot;Derleth has achieved a kind of prose equivalent of the &quot;Spoon River Anthology&quot;.&quot;

In the same year, &quot;Evening in Spring&quot; was published by Charles Scribners &amp; Sons. This work Derleth considered among his finest. What &quot;The Milwaukee Journal&quot; called &quot;this beautiful little love story&quot;, is an autobiographical novel of first love beset by small-town religious bigotry. The work received critical praise: &quot;The New Yorker&quot; considered it a story told &quot;with tenderness and charm&quot;, while the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; concluded: &quot;It&#x27;s as though he turned back the pages of an old diary and told, with rekindled emotion, of the pangs of pain and the sharp, clear sweetness of a boy&#x27;s first love.&quot; Helen Constance White, wrote in &quot;The Capital Times&quot; that it was &quot;...the best articulated, the most fully disciplined of his stories.&quot;

These were followed in 1943 with &quot;Shadow of Night&quot;, a Scribners&#x27; novel of which &quot;The Chicago Sun&quot; wrote: &quot;Structurally it has the perfection of a carved jewel...A psychological novel of the first order, and an adventure tale that is unique and inspiriting.&quot;

In November 1945, however, Derleth&#x27;s work was attacked by his one-time admirer and mentor, Sinclair Lewis. Writing in &quot;Esquire&quot;, Lewis observed, &quot;It is a proof of Mr. Derleth&#x27;s merit that he makes one want to make the journey and see his particular Avalon: The Wisconsin River shining among its islands, and the castles of Baron Pierneau and Hercules Dousman. He is a champion and a justification of regionalism. Yet he is also a burly, bounding, bustling, self-confident, opinionated, and highly-sweatered young man with faults so grievous that a melancholy perusal of them may be of more value to apprentices than a study of his serious virtues. If he could ever be persuaded that he isn&#x27;t half as good as he thinks he is, if he would learn the art of sitting still and using a blue pencil, he might become twice as good as he thinks he is – which would about rank him with Homer.&quot; Derleth good-humoredly reprinted the criticism along with a photograph of himself sans sweater, on the back cover of his 1948 country journal: &quot;Village Daybook&quot;.

A lighter side to the &quot;Sac Prairie Saga&quot; is a series of quasi-autobiographical short stories known as the &quot;Gus Elker Stories&quot;, amusing tales of country life that Peter Ruber, Derleth&#x27;s last editor, said were &quot;...models of construction and...fused with some of the most memorable characters in American literature.&quot; Most were written between 1934 and the late 1940s, though the last, &quot;Tail of the Dog&quot;, was published in 1959 and won the &quot;Scholastic Magazine&quot; short story award for the year. The series was collected and republished in &quot;Country Matters&quot; in 1996.

&quot;Walden West&quot;, published in 1961, is considered by many Derleth&#x27;s finest work. This prose meditation is built out of the same fundamental material as the series of Sac Prairie journals, but is organized around three themes: &quot;the persistence of memory...the sounds and odors of the country...and Thoreau&#x27;s observation that the &#x27;mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. A blend of nature writing, philosophic musings, and careful observation of the people and place of &quot;Sac Prairie&quot;. Of this work, George Vukelich, author of &quot;North Country Notebook&quot;, writes: &quot;Derleth&#x27;s &quot;Walden West&quot; is...the equal of Sherwood Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Winesburg,Ohio&quot;, Thornton Wilder&#x27;s &quot;Our Town&quot;, and Edgar Lee Masters&#x27; &quot;Spoon River Anthology&quot;.&quot; This was followed eight years later by &quot;Return to Walden West&quot;, a work of similar quality, but with a more noticeable environmentalist edge to the writing, notes critic Norbert Blei.

A close literary relative of the &quot;Sac Prairie Saga&quot; was Derleth&#x27;s &quot;Wisconsin Saga&quot;, which comprises several historical novels.

===Detective fiction and &quot;Solar Pons&quot;===
Detective fiction represented another substantial body of Derleth&#x27;s work. Most notable among this work was a series of 70 stories in affectionate pastiche of Sherlock Holmes, whose creator, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, he admired greatly. The stories feature a Holmes-styled British detective named Solar Pons, of 7B Praed Street in London. These included one published novel as well (&quot;Mr. Fairlie&#x27;s Final Journey&quot;). The series was greatly admired by such notable writers and critics of mystery and detective fiction as Ellery Queen (Frederic Dannay), Anthony Boucher, Vincent Starrett, and Howard Haycraft.

In his 1944 volume &quot;The Misadventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, Ellery Queen wrote of Derleth&#x27;s &quot;The Norcross Riddle&quot;, an early Pons story: &quot;How many budding authors, not even old enough to vote, could have captured the spirit and atmosphere with as much fidelity?&quot; Queen adds, &quot;his choice of the euphonic Solar Pons is an appealing addition to the fascinating lore of Sherlockian nomenclature.&quot; Vincent Starrett, in his foreword to the 1964 edition of &quot;The Casebook of Solar Pons&quot;, wrote that the series is &quot;as sparkling a galaxy of Sherlockian pastiches as we have had since the canonical entertainments came to an end.&quot;

Despite close similarities to Doyle&#x27;s creation, Pons lived in the post-World War I era, in the decades of the 1920s and 1930s. Though Derleth never wrote a Pons novel to equal &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;, editor Peter Ruber wrote that &quot;Derleth&quot; produced more than a few Solar Pons stories almost as good as Sir Arthur&#x27;s, and many that had better plot construction.&quot;

Although these stories were a form of diversion for Derleth, Ruber, who edited &quot;The Original Text Solar Pons Omnibus Edition&quot; (2000), argued: &quot;Because the stories were generally of such high quality, they ought to be assessed on their own merits as a unique contribution in the annals of mystery fiction, rather than suffering comparison as one of the endless imitators of Sherlock Holmes.&quot;

Some of the stories were self-published, through a new imprint called &quot;Mycroft &amp; Moran&quot;, an appellation of humorous significance to Holmesian scholars. For approximately a decade, an active supporting group was the Praed Street Irregulars, patterned after the Baker Street Irregulars.

In 1946, Conan Doyle&#x27;s two sons made some attempts to force Derleth to cease publishing the Solar Pons series, but the efforts were unsuccessful, and were eventually withdrawn.

Derleth&#x27;s mystery and detective fiction also included a series of works set in Sac Prairie and featuring Judge Peck as the central character.

===Youth and children&#x27;s fiction===
Derleth wrote many and varied children&#x27;s works, including biographies meant to introduce younger readers to explorer Jacques Marquette, as well as Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau. Arguably most important among his works for younger readers, however, is the Steve and Sim Mystery Series, also known as the Mill Creek Irregulars series. The ten-volume series, published between 1958 and 1970, is set in Sac Prairie of the 1920s and can thus be considered in its own right a part of the &quot;Sac Prairie Saga&quot;, as well as an extension of Derleth&#x27;s body of mystery fiction. Robert Hood, writing in the &quot;New York Times&quot; said: &quot;Steve and Sim, the major characters, are twentieth-century cousins of Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer; Derleth&#x27;s minor characters, little gems of comic drawing.&quot; The first novel in the series, &quot;The Moon Tenders&quot;, does, in fact, involve a rafting adventure down the Wisconsin River, which led regional writer Jesse Stuart to suggest the novel was one that &quot;older people might read to recapture the spirit and dream of youth.&quot; The connection to the &quot;Sac Prairie Saga&quot; was noted by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;: &quot;Once again a small midwest community in 1920s is depicted with perception, skill, and dry humor.&quot;

===Arkham House and the &quot;Cthulhu Mythos&quot;===

Derleth was a correspondent and friend of H. P. Lovecraft – when Lovecraft wrote about &quot;le Comte d&#x27;Erlette&quot; in his fiction, it was in homage to Derleth. Derleth invented the term &quot;Cthulhu Mythos&quot; to describe the fictional universe depicted in the series of stories shared by Lovecraft and other writers in his circle.

When Lovecraft died in 1937, Derleth and Donald Wandrei assembled a collection of Lovecraft&#x27;s stories and tried to get them published. Existing publishers showed little interest, so Derleth and Wandrei founded Arkham House in 1939 for that purpose. The name of the company derived from Lovecraft&#x27;s fictional town of Arkham, Massachusetts, which features in many of his stories. In 1939, Arkham House published &quot;The Outsider and Others&quot;, a huge collection that contained most of Lovecraft&#x27;s known short stories. Derleth and Wandrei soon expanded Arkham House and began a regular publishing schedule after its second book, &quot;Someone in the Dark&quot;, a collection of some of Derleth&#x27;s own horror stories, was published in 1941.

Following Lovecraft&#x27;s death, Derleth wrote a number of stories based on fragments and notes left by Lovecraft. These were published in &quot;Weird Tales&quot; and later in book form, under the byline &quot;H. P. Lovecraft and August Derleth&quot;, with Derleth calling himself a &quot;posthumous collaborator&quot;. This practice has raised objections in some quarters that Derleth simply used Lovecraft&#x27;s name to market what was essentially his own fiction; S. T. Joshi refers to the &quot;posthumous collaborations&quot; as marking the beginning of &quot;perhaps the most disreputable phase of Derleth&#x27;s activities&quot;.

Dirk W. Mosig, S. T. Joshi, and Richard L. Tierney were dissatisfied with Derleth&#x27;s invention of the term &quot;Cthulhu Mythos&quot; (Lovecraft himself used &quot;Yog-Sothothery&quot;) and his presentation of Lovecraft&#x27;s fiction as having an overall pattern reflecting Derleth&#x27;s own Christian world view, which they contrast with Lovecraft&#x27;s depiction of an amoral universe. However, Robert M. Price points out that while Derleth&#x27;s tales are distinct from Lovecraft&#x27;s in their use of hope and his depiction of a struggle between good and evil, nevertheless the basis of Derleth&#x27;s systemization are found in Lovecraft. He also suggests that the differences can be overstated:

Derleth &quot;was&quot; more optimistic than Lovecraft in his conception of the Mythos, but we are dealing with a difference more of degree than kind. There are indeed tales wherein Derleth&#x27;s protagonists get off scot-free (like &quot;The Shadow in the Attic&quot;, &quot;Witches&#x27; Hollow&quot;, or &quot;The Shuttered Room&quot;), but often the hero is doomed (e.g., &quot;The House in the Valley&quot;, &quot;The Peabody Heritage&quot;, &quot;Something in Wood&quot;), as in Lovecraft. And it must be remembered that an occasional Lovecraftian hero does manage to overcome the odds, e.g., in &quot;The Horror in the Museum&quot;, &quot;The Shunned House&quot;, and &#x27;The Case of Charles Dexter Ward&#x27;. 

Derleth also treated Lovecraft&#x27;s Great Old Ones as representatives of elemental forces, creating new fictional entities to flesh out this framework.

Such debates aside, Derleth&#x27;s founding of Arkham House and his successful effort to rescue Lovecraft from literary oblivion are widely acknowledged by practitioners in the horror field as seminal events in the field. For instance, Ramsey Campbell has acknowledged Derleth&#x27;s encouragement and guidance during the early part of his own writing career, and Kirby McCauley has cited Derleth and Arkham House as an inspiration for his own anthology &quot;Dark Forces&quot;. Arkham House and Derleth published &quot;Dark Carnival&quot;, the first book by Ray Bradbury, as well. Brian Lumley cites the importance of Derleth to his own Lovecraftian work, and contends in a 2009 introduction to Derleth&#x27;s work that he was &quot;...one of the first, finest, and most discerning editors and publishers of macabre fiction.&quot;

Important as was Derleth&#x27;s work to rescue H.P. Lovecraft from literary obscurity at the time of Lovecraft&#x27;s death, Derleth also built a body of horror and spectral fiction of his own; still frequently anthologized. The best of this work, recently reprinted in four volumes of short stories – most of which were originally published in &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, illustrates Derleth&#x27;s original abilities in the genre. While Derleth considered his work in this genre less important than his most serious literary efforts, the compilers of these four anthologies, including Ramsey Campbell, note that the stories still resonate after more than 50 years.

In 2009, The Library of America selected Derleth&#x27;s story &quot;The Panelled Room&quot; for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American Fantastic Tales.

===Other works===
Derleth also wrote many historical novels, as part of both the &quot;Sac Prairie Saga&quot; and the &quot;Wisconsin Saga&quot;. He also wrote history; arguably most notable among these was &quot;The Wisconsin: River of a Thousand Isles&quot;, published in 1942. The work was one in a series entitled &quot;The Rivers of America&quot;, conceived by writer Constance Lindsay Skinner during the Great Depression as a series that would connect Americans to their heritage through the history of the great rivers of the nation. Skinner wanted the series to be written by artists, not academicians. Derleth, while not a trained historian, was, according to former Wisconsin state historian William F. Thompson, &quot;...a very competent regional historian who based his historical writing upon research in the primary documents and who regularly sought the help of professionals... .&quot; In the foreword to the 1985 reissue of the work by The University of Wisconsin Press, Thompson concluded: &quot;No other writer, of whatever background or training, knew and understood his particular &#x27;corner of the earth&#x27; better than August Derleth.&quot;

Additionally, Derleth wrote a number of volumes of poetry. Three of his collections – &quot;Rind of Earth&quot; (1942), &quot;Selected Poems&quot; (1944), and &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; (1945) – were published by the Decker Press, which also printed the work of other Midwestern poets such as Edgar Lee Masters.

Derleth was also the author of several biographies of other writers, including Zona Gale, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau.

He also wrote introductions to several collections of classic early 20th century comics, such as &quot;Buster Brown&quot;, &quot;Little Nemo in Slumberland&quot;, and &quot;Katzenjammer Kids&quot;, as well as a book of children&#x27;s poetry entitled &quot;A Boy&#x27;s Way&quot;, and the foreword to &quot;Tales from an Indian Lodge&quot; by Phebe Jewell Nichols&quot;.&quot; Derleth also wrote under the pen names Stephen Grendon, Kenyon Holmes and Tally Mason.

Derleth&#x27;s papers were donated to the Wisconsin Historical Society in Madison.

<text>The Alps () are one of the highest and most extensive mountain ranges in Europe, stretching approximately across eight Alpine countries (from west to east): Monaco, France, Switzerland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Germany, Austria and Slovenia.

The Alpine arch extends from Nice on the western Mediterranean to Trieste on the Adriatic and Vienna at the beginning of the Pannonian Basin. The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn.

Mont Blanc spans the French–Italian border, and at is the highest mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area contains 82 peaks higher than .

The altitude and size of the range affect the climate in Europe; in the mountains, precipitation levels vary greatly and climatic conditions consist of distinct zones. Wildlife such as ibex live in the higher peaks to elevations of , and plants such as edelweiss grow in rocky areas in lower elevations as well as in higher elevations.

Evidence of human habitation in the Alps goes back to the Palaeolithic era. A mummified man (&quot;Ötzi&quot;), determined to be 5,000 years old, was discovered on a glacier at the Austrian–Italian border in 1991.

By the 6th century BC, the Celtic La Tène culture was well established. Hannibal notably crossed the Alps with a herd of elephants, and the Romans had settlements in the region. In 1800, Napoleon crossed one of the mountain passes with an army of 40,000. The 18th and 19th centuries saw an influx of naturalists, writers, and artists, in particular, the Romanticists, followed by the golden age of alpinism as mountaineers began to ascend the peaks of the Alps.

The Alpine region has a strong cultural identity. Traditional practices such as farming, cheesemaking, and woodworking still thrive in Alpine villages. However, the tourist industry began to grow early in the 20th century and expanded significantly after World War II, eventually becoming the dominant industry by the end of the century.

The Winter Olympic Games have been hosted in the Swiss, French, Italian, Austrian and German Alps. the region is home to 14 million people and has 120 million annual visitors.

== Etymology and toponymy ==

The English word &quot;Alps&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;Alpes&quot;.

The Latin word &quot;&quot; could possibly come from the adjective &quot;&quot; (&quot;white&quot;), or could possibly come from the Greek goddess Alphito, whose name is related to &quot;alphita&quot;, the &quot;white flour&quot;; &quot;alphos&quot;, a dull white leprosy; and finally the Proto-Indo-European word . Similarly, the river god Alpheus is also supposed to derive from the Greek &quot;alphos&quot; and means whitish.

In his commentary on the &quot;Aeneid&quot; of Virgil, the late fourth-century grammarian Maurus Servius Honoratus says that all high mountains are called &quot;Alpes&quot; by Celts.

According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the Latin &quot;Alpes&quot; might derive from a pre-Indo-European word *&quot;alb&quot; &quot;hill&quot;; &quot;Albania&quot; is a related derivation. Albania, the name of the region known as the country of Albania, has been used as a name for several mountainous areas across Europe.

In Roman times, &quot;Albania&quot; was a name for the eastern Caucasus, while in the English languages &quot;Albania&quot; (or &quot;Albany&quot;) was occasionally used as a name for Scotland, although it is more likely derived from the Latin word &quot;&quot;, the colour white.

In modern languages the term &quot;alp&quot;, &quot;alm&quot;, &quot;albe&quot; or &quot;alpe&quot; refers to a grazing pastures in the alpine regions below the glaciers, not the peaks.

An &quot;alp&quot; refers to a high mountain pasture, typically near or above the tree line, where cows and other livestock are taken to be grazed during the summer months and where huts and hay barns can be found, sometimes constituting tiny hamlets. Therefore, the term &quot;the Alps&quot;, as a reference to the mountains, is a misnomer. The term for the mountain peaks varies by nation and language: words such as &quot;Horn&quot;, &quot;Kogel&quot;, &quot;Kopf&quot;, &quot;Gipfel&quot;, &quot;Spitze&quot;, &quot;Stock&quot;, and &quot;Berg&quot; are used in German-speaking regions; &quot;Mont&quot;, &quot;Pic&quot;, &quot;Tête&quot;, &quot;Pointe&quot;, &quot;Dent&quot;, &quot;Roche&quot;, and &quot;Aiguille&quot; in French-speaking regions; and &quot;Monte&quot;, &quot;Picco&quot;, &quot;Corno&quot;, &quot;Punta&quot;, &quot;Pizzo&quot;, or &quot;Cima&quot; in Italian-speaking regions.

== Geography ==
The Alps are a crescent shaped geographic feature of central Europe that ranges in an arc (curved line) from east to west and is in width. The mean height of the mountain peaks is . The range stretches from the Mediterranean Sea north above the Po basin, extending through France from Grenoble, and stretching eastward through mid and southern Switzerland. The range continues onward toward Vienna, Austria, and southeast to the Adriatic Sea and Slovenia.

To the south it dips into northern Italy and to the north extends to the southern border of Bavaria in Germany. In areas like Chiasso, Switzerland, and Allgäu, Bavaria, the demarcation between the mountain range and the flatlands are clear; in other places such as Geneva, the demarcation is less clear.

The Alps are found in the following countries: Austria (28.7% of the range&#x27;s area), Italy (27.2%), France (21.4%), Switzerland (13.2%), Germany (5.8%), Slovenia (3.6%), Liechtenstein (0.08%) and Monaco (0.001%).
The highest portion of the range is divided by the glacial trough of the Rhône valley, from Mont Blanc to the Matterhorn and Monte Rosa on the southern side, and the Bernese Alps on the northern. The peaks in the easterly portion of the range, in Austria and Slovenia, are smaller than those in the central and western portions.

The variances in nomenclature in the region spanned by the Alps make classification of the mountains and subregions difficult, but a general classification is that of the Eastern Alps and Western Alps with the divide between the two occurring in eastern Switzerland according to geologist Stefan Schmid, near the Splügen Pass.

The highest peaks of the Western Alps and Eastern Alps, respectively, are Mont Blanc, at , and Piz Bernina, at . The second-highest major peaks are Monte Rosa, at , and Ortler, at , respectively.

A series of lower mountain ranges run parallel to the main chain of the Alps, including the French Prealps in France and the Jura Mountains in Switzerland and France. The secondary chain of the Alps follows the watershed from the Mediterranean Sea to the Wienerwald, passing over many of the highest and most well-known peaks in the Alps. From the Colle di Cadibona to Col de Tende it runs westwards, before turning to the northwest and then, near the Colle della Maddalena, to the north. Upon reaching the Swiss border, the line of the main chain heads approximately east-northeast, a heading it follows until its end near Vienna.

The northeast end of the Alpine arc, directly on the Danube, which flows into the Black Sea, is the Leopoldsberg near Vienna. In contrast, the southeastern part of the Alps ends on the Adriatic Sea in the area around Trieste towards Duino and Barcola.

== Passes ==

The Alps have been crossed for war and commerce, and by pilgrims, students, and tourists. Crossing routes by road, train, or foot are known as &quot;passes&quot;, and usually consist of depressions in the mountains in which a valley leads from the plains and hilly pre-mountainous zones. Merchant traffic was supported by pack animals such as mules. In the late Middle Ages heavy carts and sleighs were in use on the alpine passes.

In the medieval period hospices were established by religious orders at the summits of many of the main passes. The most important passes are the Col de l&#x27;Iseran (the highest), the Col Agnel, the Brenner Pass, the Mont-Cenis, the Great St. Bernard Pass, the Col de Tende, the Gotthard Pass, the Semmering Pass, the Simplon Pass, and the Stelvio Pass.

Crossing the Italian-Austrian border, the Brenner Pass separates the Ötztal Alps and Zillertal Alps and has been in use as a trading route since the 14th century. The lowest of the Alpine passes at is the Semmering crossing from Lower Austria to Styria. It has been in continuous use since the 12th century when a hospice was built there. A railroad with a tunnel long was built along the route of the pass in the mid-19th century. With a summit of , the Great St Bernard Pass is one of the highest in the Alps, crossing the Italian-Swiss border east of the Pennine Alps along the flanks of Mont Blanc. The pass was used by Napoleon Bonaparte to cross 40,000 troops in 1800.

The Mont Cenis pass has been a major commercial and military road between Western Europe and Italy. The pass was crossed by many troops on their way to the Italian peninsula. From Constantine I, Pepin the Short and Charlemagne to Henry IV, Napoléon and more recently the German Gebirgsjägers during World War II. 

In the 18th century the principal passes of the Alps were modernized by engineers to speed up passenger and freight transport. The Mont Cenis pass has been supplanted by the Fréjus Rail Tunnel opening in 1871, while the Fréjus Road Tunnel opened 1980. Railway lines could not be built in the Alps without tunnels and bridges. Apart from the Mont Cenis railway tunnel the Semmering railway tunnel and the Gotthard railway tunnel were built between 1854 and 1882. By the early 19th century eight trans-alpine railway lines had been put into operation.

The Saint Gotthard Pass crosses from Central Switzerland to Ticino. In 1882 the Saint Gotthard Railway Tunnel was opened connecting Lucerne in Switzerland, with Milan in Italy. 98 years later followed Gotthard Road Tunnel ( long) connecting the A2 motorway in Göschenen on the north side with Airolo on the south side, exactly like the railway tunnel.

On 1 June 2016 the world&#x27;s longest railway tunnel, the Gotthard Base Tunnel, was opened, which connects Erstfeld in canton of Uri with Bodio in canton of Ticino by two single tubes of .

It is the first tunnel that traverses the Alps on a flat route.

From 11 December 2016, it has been part of the regular railway timetable and used hourly as standard ride between Basel/Lucerne/Zurich and Bellinzona/Lugano/Milan.

The highest pass in the alps is the Col de l&#x27;Iseran in Savoy (France) at , followed by the Stelvio Pass in northern Italy at ; the road was built in the 1820s.

== Highest mountains ==
The Union Internationale des Associations d&#x27;Alpinisme (UIAA) has defined a list of 82 &quot;official&quot; Alpine summits that reach at least . The list includes not only mountains, but also subpeaks with little prominence that are considered important mountaineering objectives. Below are listed the 29 &quot;four-thousanders&quot; with at least of prominence.

While Mont Blanc was first climbed in 1786 and the Jungfrau in 1811, most of the Alpine four-thousanders were climbed during the second half of the 19th century, notably Piz Bernina (1850), the Dom (1858), the Grand Combin (1859), the Weisshorn (1861) and the Barre des Écrins (1864); the ascent of the Matterhorn in 1865 marked the end of the golden age of alpinism. Karl Blodig (1859–1956) was among the first to successfully climb all the major 4,000 m peaks. He completed his series of ascents in 1911. Many of the big Alpine three-thousanders were climbed in the early 19th century, notably the Grossglockner (1800) and the Ortler (1804), although some of them were climbed only much later, such at Mont Pelvoux (1848), Monte Viso (1861) and La Meije (1877).

The first British Mont Blanc ascent by a man was in 1788; the first ascent by a woman was in 1808. By the mid-1850s Swiss mountaineers had ascended most of the peaks and were eagerly sought as mountain guides. Edward Whymper reached the top of the Matterhorn in 1865 (after seven attempts), and in 1938 the last of the six great north faces of the Alps was climbed with the first ascent of the Eiger &quot;Nordwand&quot; (north face of the Eiger).


== Geology and orogeny ==
Important geological concepts were established as naturalists began studying the rock formations of the Alps in the 18th century. In the mid-19th century, the now-defunct idea of geosynclines was used to explain the presence of &quot;folded&quot; mountain chains. This theory was replaced in the mid-20th century by the theory of plate tectonics.

The formation of the Alps (the Alpine orogeny) was an episodic process that began about 300 million years ago. In the Paleozoic Era the Pangaean supercontinent consisted of a single tectonic plate; it broke into separate plates during the Mesozoic Era and the Tethys sea developed between Laurasia and Gondwana during the Jurassic Period. The Tethys was later squeezed between colliding plates causing the formation of mountain ranges called the Alpide belt, from Gibraltar through the Himalayas to Indonesia—a process that began at the end of the Mesozoic and continues into the present. The formation of the Alps was a segment of this orogenic process, caused by the collision between the African and the Eurasian plates that began in the late Cretaceous Period.

Under extreme compressive stresses and pressure, marine sedimentary rocks were uplifted, forming characteristic recumbent folds, and thrust faults. As the rising peaks underwent erosion, a layer of marine flysch sediments was deposited in the foreland basin, and the sediments became involved in younger folds as the orogeny progressed. Coarse sediments from the continual uplift and erosion were later deposited in foreland areas north of the Alps. These regions in Switzerland and Bavaria are well-developed, containing classic examples of flysch, which is sedimentary rock formed during mountain building.

The Alpine orogeny occurred in ongoing cycles through to the Paleogene causing differences in folded structures, with a late-stage orogeny causing the development of the Jura Mountains. A series of tectonic events in the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods caused different paleogeographic regions. The Alps are subdivided by different lithology (rock composition) and nappe structures according to the orogenic events that affected them. The geological subdivision differentiates the Western, Eastern Alps, and Southern Alps: the Helveticum in the north, the Penninicum and Austroalpine system in the centre and, south of the Periadriatic Seam, the Southern Alpine system.

According to geologist Stefan Schmid, because the Western Alps underwent a metamorphic event in the Cenozoic Era while the Austroalpine peaks underwent an event in the Cretaceous Period, the two areas show distinct differences in nappe formations. Flysch deposits in the Southern Alps of Lombardy probably occurred in the Cretaceous or later.

Peaks in France, Italy and Switzerland lie in the &quot;Houillière zone&quot;, which consists of basement with sediments from the Mesozoic Era. High &quot;massifs&quot; with external sedimentary cover are more common in the Western Alps and were affected by Neogene Period thin-skinned thrusting whereas the Eastern Alps have comparatively few high peaked massifs. Similarly the peaks in eastern Switzerland extending to western Austria (Helvetic nappes) consist of thin-skinned sedimentary folding that detached from former basement rock.

In simple terms, the structure of the Alps consists of layers of rock of European, African, and oceanic (Tethyan) origin. The bottom nappe structure is of continental European origin, above which are stacked marine sediment nappes, topped off by nappes derived from the African plate. The Matterhorn is an example of the ongoing orogeny and shows evidence of great folding. The tip of the mountain consists of gneisses from the African plate; the base of the peak, below the glaciated area, consists of European basement rock. The sequence of Tethyan marine sediments and their oceanic basement is sandwiched between rock derived from the African and European plates.

The core regions of the Alpine orogenic belt have been folded and fractured in such a manner that erosion produced the characteristic steep vertical peaks of the Swiss Alps that rise seemingly straight out of the foreland areas. Peaks such as Mont Blanc, the Matterhorn, and high peaks in the Pennine Alps, the Briançonnais, and Hohe Tauern consist of layers of rock from the various orogenies including exposures of basement rock.

Due to the ever-present geologic instability, earthquakes continue in the Alps to this day. Typically, the largest earthquakes in the alps have been between magnitude 6 and 7 on the Richter scale. Geodetic measurements show ongoing topographic uplift at rates of up to about 2.5 mm per year in the North, Western and Central Alps, and at ~1 mm per year in the Eastern and South-Western Alps. The underlying mechanisms that jointly drive the present-day uplift pattern are the isostatic rebound due to the melting of the last glacial maximum ice-cap or long-term erosion, detachment of the Western Alpine subducting slab, mantle convection as well as ongoing horizontal convergence between Africa and Europe, but their relative contributions to the uplift of the Alps are difficult to quantify and likely to vary significantly in space and time.

== Minerals ==
The Alps are a source of minerals that have been mined for thousands of years. In the 8th to 6th centuries, BC during the Hallstatt culture, Celtic tribes mined copper; later the Romans mined gold for coins in the Bad Gastein area. Erzberg in Styria furnishes high-quality iron ore for the steel industry. Crystals, such as cinnabar, amethyst, and quartz, are found throughout much of the Alpine region. The cinnabar deposits in Slovenia are a notable source of cinnabar pigments.

Alpine crystals have been studied and collected for hundreds of years and began to be classified in the 18th century. Leonhard Euler studied the shapes of crystals, and by the 19th-century crystal hunting was common in Alpine regions. David Friedrich Wiser amassed a collection of 8000 crystals that he studied and documented. In the 20th century Robert Parker wrote a well-known work about the rock crystals of the Swiss Alps; at the same period a commission was established to control and standardize the naming of Alpine minerals.

== Glaciers ==
In the Miocene Epoch the mountains underwent severe erosion because of glaciation, which was noted in the mid-19th century by naturalist Louis Agassiz who presented a paper proclaiming the Alps were covered in ice at various intervals—a theory he formed when studying rocks near his Neuchâtel home which he believed originated to the west in the Bernese Oberland. Because of his work he came to be known as the &quot;father of the ice-age concept&quot; although other naturalists before him put forth similar ideas.

Agassiz studied glacier movement in the 1840s at the Unteraar Glacier where he found the glacier moved per year, more rapidly in the middle than at the edges. His work was continued by other scientists and now a permanent laboratory exists inside a glacier under the Jungfraujoch, devoted exclusively to the study of Alpine glaciers.

Glaciers pick up rocks and sediment with them as they flow. This causes erosion and the formation of valleys over time. The Inn valley is an example of a valley carved by glaciers during the ice ages with a typical terraced structure caused by erosion. Eroded rocks from the most recent ice age lie at the bottom of the valley while the top of the valley consists of erosion from earlier ice ages. Glacial valleys have characteristically steep walls (reliefs); valleys with lower reliefs and talus slopes are remnants of glacial troughs or previously infilled valleys. Moraines, piles of rock picked up during the movement of the glacier, accumulate at edges, centre, and the terminus of glaciers.

Alpine glaciers can be straight rivers of ice, long sweeping rivers, spread in a fan-like shape (Piedmont glaciers), and curtains of ice that hang from vertical slopes of the mountain peaks. The stress of the movement causes the ice to break and crack loudly, perhaps explaining why the mountains were believed to be home to dragons in the medieval period. The cracking creates unpredictable and dangerous crevasses, often invisible under new snowfall, which causes the greatest danger to mountaineers.

Glaciers end in ice caves (the Rhône Glacier), by trailing into a lake or river, or by shedding snowmelt on a meadow. Sometimes a piece of glacier will detach or break resulting in flooding, property damage, and loss of life.

High levels of precipitation cause the glaciers to descend to permafrost levels in some areas whereas in other, more arid regions, glaciers remain above about the level. The of the Alps covered by glaciers in 1876 had shrunk to by 1973, resulting in decreased river run-off levels. Forty percent of the glaciation in Austria has disappeared since 1850, and 30% of that in Switzerland.

Although the Alpine topography shows marked glacial morphologies, the mechanisms by which glacial reshaping occurs are unclear. Numerical modeling suggests that glacial erosion propagates from low elevations to high elevations leading to an early increase of local relief followed by lowering of the mean orogen elevation.

== Rivers and lakes ==

The Alps provide lowland Europe with drinking water, irrigation, and hydroelectric power. Although the area is only about 11% of the surface area of Europe, the Alps provide up to 90% of water to lowland Europe, particularly to arid areas and during the summer months. Cities such as Milan depend on 80% of water from Alpine runoff. Water from the rivers is used in at least 550 hydroelectricity power plants, considering only those producing at least 10MW of electricity.

Major European rivers flow from the Alps, such as the Rhine, the Rhône, the Inn, and the Po, all of which have headwaters in the Alps and flow into neighbouring countries, finally emptying into the North Sea, the Mediterranean Sea, the Adriatic Sea and the Black Sea. Other rivers such as the Danube have major tributaries flowing into them that originate in the Alps.

The Rhône is second to the Nile as a freshwater source to the Mediterranean Sea; the river begins as glacial meltwater, flows into Lake Geneva, and from there to France where one of its uses is to cool nuclear power plants. The Rhine originates in a area in Switzerland and represents almost 60% of water exported from the country. Tributary valleys, some of which are complicated, channel water to the main valleys which can experience flooding during the snowmelt season when rapid runoff causes debris torrents and swollen rivers.

The rivers form lakes, such as Lake Geneva, a crescent-shaped lake crossing the Swiss border with Lausanne on the Swiss side and the town of Evian-les-Bains on the French side. In Germany, the medieval St. Bartholomew&#x27;s chapel was built on the south side of the Königssee, accessible only by boat or by climbing over the abutting peaks.
Additionally, the Alps have led to the creation of large lakes in Italy. For instance, the Sarca, the primary inflow of Lake Garda, originates in the Italian Alps. The Italian Lakes are a popular tourist destination since the Roman Era for their mild climate.

Scientists have been studying the impact of climate change and water use. For example, each year more water is diverted from rivers for snowmaking in the ski resorts, the effect of which is yet unknown. Furthermore, the decrease of glaciated areas combined with a succession of winters with lower-than-expected precipitation may have a future impact on the rivers in the Alps as well as an effect on the water availability to the lowlands.

== Climate ==
The Alps are a classic example of what happens when a temperate area at lower altitude gives way to higher-elevation terrain. Elevations around the world that have cold climates similar to those of the polar regions have been called Alpine. A rise from sea level into the upper regions of the atmosphere causes the temperature to decrease (see adiabatic lapse rate). The effect of mountain chains on prevailing winds is to carry warm air belonging to the lower region into an upper zone, where it expands in volume at the cost of a proportionate loss of temperature, often accompanied by precipitation in the form of snow or rain. The height of the Alps is sufficient to divide the weather patterns in Europe into a wet north and dry south because moisture is sucked from the air as it flows over the high peaks.

The severe weather in the Alps has been studied since the 18th century; particularly the weather patterns such as the seasonal foehn wind. Numerous weather stations were placed in the mountains early in the early 20th century, providing continuous data for climatologists. Some of the valleys are quite arid such as the Aosta Valley in Italy, the Maurienne in France, the Valais in Switzerland, and northern Tyrol.

The areas that are not arid and receive high precipitation experience periodic flooding from rapid snowmelt and runoff. The mean precipitation in the Alps ranges from a low of per year to per year, with the higher levels occurring at high altitudes. At altitudes between , snowfall begins in November and accumulates through to April or May when the melt begins. Snow lines vary from , above which the snow is permanent and the temperatures hover around the freezing point even during July and August. High-water levels in streams and rivers peak in June and July when the snow is still melting at the higher altitudes.

The Alps are split into five climatic zones, each with different vegetation. The climate, plant life, and animal life vary among the different sections or zones of the mountains. The lowest zone is the colline zone, which exists between , depending on the location. The montane zone extends from , followed by the sub-Alpine zone from . The Alpine zone, extending from tree line to the snow line, is followed by the glacial zone, which covers the glaciated areas of the mountain. Climatic conditions show variances within the same zones; for example, weather conditions at the head of a mountain valley, extending directly from the peaks, are colder and more severe than those at the mouth of a valley which tend to be less severe and receive less snowfall.

;Climate change

Various models of climate change have been projected into the 22nd century for the Alps, with an expectation that a trend toward increased temperatures will have an effect on snowfall, snowpack, glaciation, and river runoff. Significant changes, of both natural and anthropogenic origins, have already been diagnosed from observations, including a 5.6% reduction per decade in snow cover duration over the last 50 years, which also highlights climate change adaptation needs due to impacts on the climate and regional socio-economic activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1038/s41558-022-01575-3&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecology ==
=== Flora ===


Thirteen thousand species of plants have been identified in the Alpine regions. Alpine plants are grouped by habitat and soil type which can be limestone or non-calcareous. The habitats range from meadows, bogs, and woodland (deciduous and coniferous) areas to soil-less scree and moraines, and rock faces and ridges. A natural vegetation limit with altitude is given by the presence of the chief deciduous trees—oak, beech, ash and sycamore maple. These do not reach the same elevation, nor are they often found growing together, but their upper limit corresponds accurately enough to the change from a temperate to a colder climate that is further proved by a change in the presence of wild herbaceous vegetation. This limit usually lies about above the sea on the north side of the Alps, but on the southern slopes it often rises to , sometimes even to .
Above the forestry, there is often a band of dwarf pine trees (&quot;Pinus mugo&quot;), which is in turn superseded by &quot;Alpenrosen&quot;, dwarf shrubs, typically &quot;Rhododendron ferrugineum&quot; (on acid soils) or &quot;Rhododendron hirsutum&quot; (on alkaline soils). Although Alpenrose prefers acidic soil, the plants are found throughout the region. Above the tree line is the area defined as &quot;alpine&quot; where in the alpine meadow plants are found that have adapted well to harsh conditions of cold temperatures, aridity, and high altitudes. The alpine area fluctuates greatly because of regional fluctuations in tree lines.

Alpine plants such as the Alpine gentian grow in abundance in areas such as the meadows above the Lauterbrunnental. Gentians are named after the Illyrian king Gentius, and 40 species of the early-spring blooming flower grow in the Alps, in a range of . Writing about the gentians in Switzerland D. H. Lawrence described them as &quot;darkening the day-time, torch-like with the smoking blueness of Pluto&#x27;s gloom.&quot; Gentians tend to &quot;appear&quot; repeatedly as the spring blooming takes place at progressively later dates, moving from the lower altitude to the higher altitude meadows where the snow melts much later than in the valleys. On the highest rocky ledges, the spring flowers bloom in the summer.


At these higher altitudes, the plants tend to form isolated cushions. In the Alps, several species of flowering plants have been recorded above , including &quot;Ranunculus glacialis&quot;, &quot;Androsace alpina&quot; and &quot;Saxifraga biflora&quot;. &quot;Eritrichium nanum&quot;, commonly known as the King of the Alps, is the most elusive of the alpine flowers, growing on rocky ridges at . Perhaps the best known of the alpine plants is Edelweiss which grows in rocky areas and can be found at altitudes as low as and as high as . The plants that grow at the highest altitudes have adapted to conditions by specialization such as growing in rock screes that give protection from winds.

The extreme and stressful climatic conditions give way to the growth of plant species with secondary metabolites important for medicinal purposes. &quot;Origanum vulgare&quot;, &quot;Prunella vulgaris&quot;, &quot;Solanum nigrum&quot;, and &quot;Urtica dioica&quot; are some of the more useful medicinal species found in the Alps.
Human interference has nearly exterminated the trees in many areas, and, except for the beech forests of the Austrian Alps, forests of deciduous trees are rarely found after the extreme deforestation between the 17th and 19th centuries. The vegetation has changed since the second half of the 20th century, as the high alpine meadows cease to be harvested for hay or used for grazing which eventually might result in a regrowth of the forest. In some areas, the modern practice of building ski runs by mechanical means has destroyed the underlying tundra from which the plant life cannot recover during the non-skiing months, whereas areas that still practice a natural &quot;piste&quot; type of ski slope building preserve the fragile underlayers.

=== Fauna ===
The Alps are a habitat for 30,000 species of wildlife, ranging from the tiniest snow fleas to brown bears, many of which have made adaptations to the harsh cold conditions and high altitudes to the point that some only survive in specific micro-climates either directly above or below the snow line.

The largest mammal to live in the highest altitudes are the alpine ibex, which have been sighted as high as . The ibex live in caves and descend to eat the succulent alpine grasses. Classified as antelopes, chamois are smaller than ibex and found throughout the Alps, living above the tree line and are common in the entire alpine range. Areas of the eastern Alps are still home to brown bears. In Switzerland the canton of Bern was named for the bears but the last bear is recorded as having been killed in 1792 above Kleine Scheidegg by three hunters from Grindelwald.

Many rodents such as voles live underground. Marmots live almost exclusively above the tree line as high as . They hibernate in large groups to provide warmth, and can be found in all areas of the Alps, in large colonies they build beneath the alpine pastures. Golden eagles and bearded vultures are the largest birds to be found in the Alps; they nest high on rocky ledges and can be found at altitudes of . The most common bird is the alpine chough which can be found scavenging at climber&#x27;s huts or the Jungfraujoch, a high-altitude tourist destination.

Reptiles such as adders and vipers live up to the snow line; because they cannot bear the cold temperatures they hibernate underground and soak up the warmth on rocky ledges. The high-altitude Alpine salamanders have adapted to living above the snow line by giving birth to fully developed young rather than laying eggs. Brown trout can be found in the streams up to the snow line. Molluscs such as the wood snail live up the snow line. Popularly gathered as food, the snails are now protected.

Several species of moths live in the Alps, some of which are believed to have evolved in the same habitat up to 120 million years ago, long before the Alps were created. Blue butterflies can commonly be seen drinking from the snowmelt; some species of blues fly as high as . The butterflies tend to be large, such as those from the swallowtail &quot;Parnassius&quot; family, with a habitat that ranges to . Twelve species of beetles have habitats up to the snow line; the most beautiful and formerly collected for its colours but now protected is &quot;Rosalia alpina&quot;. Spiders, such as the large wolf spider, live above the snow line and can be seen as high as . Scorpions can be found in the Italian Alps.

Some of the species of moths and insects show evidence of having been indigenous to the area from as long ago as the Alpine orogeny. In Émosson in Valais, Switzerland, dinosaur tracks were found in the 1970s, dating probably from the Triassic Period.

== History ==
=== Prehistory ===

When the ice melted after the Würm glaciation, paleolithic settlements were established along the lake shores and in cave systems. Evidence of human habitation has been found in caves near the Vercors Cave System, close to Grenoble and Echirolles. In Austria, the Mondsee lake shows evidence of houses built on piles. Standing stones have been found in the Alpine areas of France and Italy. About 200,000 drawings and etchings have been documented, and are known as the Rock Drawings in Valcamonica.

A mummy of a neolithic human, known as Ötzi, was discovered on the Similaun. His clothing lets modern people assume that he was an alpine farmer, while the location and manner of his death suggests that Ötzi was traveling. Analysis of the mitochondrial DNA of Ötzi, has shown that he belongs to the K1 subclade. His remains and personal belongings are on exhibit at the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology in Bolzano, South Tyrol, Italy.

From the 13th to the 6th century BC much of the Alps was settled by the Germanic peoples, Lombards, Alemanni, Bavarii, and Franks. Celt tribes settled in modern-day Switzerland between 1500 and 1000 BC. The Raeti lived in the eastern regions, while the west was occupied by the Helvetii and the Allobroges settled in the Rhône valley and in Savoy. The Ligures and Adriatic Veneti lived in Northwest Italy and Triveneto respectively. The Celts mined salt in areas such as Salzburg, where evidence was found of the Hallstatt culture. By the 6th century BC the La Tène culture was well established in the region, and became known for high quality Celtic art.

Between 430 and 400 BC prolonged warfare in the Alps resulted in the devastation of agricultural land and human settlements, ultimately triggering the enslavement of men, women, and children, goods had to be imported as a result. The Etruscan civilization responded to raids by the Massalia and acquired absolute control over the Alpine trade routes. Aggressors in modern-day Italy were dealt with and an alliance was formed with the Celts. The grip of the Etruscan settlements broke down, as the Roman political system expanded, so as to take control over Alpine trade routes that connected human settlements in the Alps with settlements in the Mediterranean.

During the Second Punic War in 218 BC, the Carthage general Hannibal initiated one of the most celebrated achievements of any military force in ancient warfare, recorded as Hannibal crossing the Alps. The Roman people built roads along the Alpine mountain passes, which continued to be used through the medieval period. Roman road markers can still be found on the Alpine mountain passes.

During the Gallic Wars in 58 BC Julius Caesar defeated the Helvetii. The Rhaetian continued to resist but their territory was eventually conquered when the Romans crossed the Danube valley and defeated the Brigantes. The Romans built settlements in the Alps. In towns such as Aosta, Martigny, Lausanne, and Partenkirchen remains of villas, arenas, and temples have been discovered.

=== Christianity, feudalism, and Napoleonic wars ===
Christianity was established in the Alps by the Roman people. Monasteries and churches were constructed, even at high Alpine altitudes. The Franks expanded their Carolingian Empire, while the Baiuvarii introduced feudalism in the eastern Alps. The construction of castles in the Alps supported the growing number of dukedoms and kingdoms. Castello del Buonconsiglio in Trento, still has intricate frescoes, and excellent examples of Gothic art. The Château de Chillon is preserved as an example of medieval architecture. There are several important alpine saints and one such one is Saint Maurice. Much of the medieval period was a time of power struggles between competing dynasties such as the House of Savoy, the Visconti of Milan, and the House of Habsburg.

The Great St Bernard Hospice, built in the 9th or 10th centuries, at the summit of the Great Saint Bernard Pass was a shelter for humans and destination for pilgrims. In 1291, to protect themselves from incursions by the House of Habsburg, four Alpine cantons drew up the Federal Charter of 1291, which is considered to be a declaration of independence from neighboring kingdoms. After a series of battles fought in the 13th, 14th, and 15th centuries, more cantons joined the confederacy and by the 16th century, Switzerland was established as a sovereign state.

In the Alps, the War of the Spanish Succession fallout resulted in a 1713 treaty, part of the Peace of Utrecht, which relocated the Western Alps border along the watersheds. Historically, the Alps were used to determine the borders of political and administrative gangs, but the Peace of Utrecht was the first significant body of treaty that considered geographical conditions. The Alps were carved up and borders were agreed, so that enclaves in the Alps could be eliminated.

During the Napoleonic Wars in the late 18th century and early 19th century, Napoleon annexed territory formerly controlled by the House of Habsburg, and the House of Savoy. In 1798, the Helvetic Republic was established, two years later an army across the Great St Bernard Pass. In 1799 the Russian imperial military engaged the revolutionary French army in the Alps, this episode has been recorded as significant achievement in mountain warfare. In October 1799 the troops commanded by Alexander Suvorov were surrounded in the Alps by much larger French troops. The Russian troops broke out, mauled the French troops, and retreated through the Panix Pass.

After the fall of Napoleon, many alpine countries developed heavy protections to prevent further invasion. Thus, Savoy built a series of fortifications to protect the major alpine passes, such as the col du Mont-Cenis, which was crossed by Charlemagne to obliterate the Lombards.

In the 19th century, the monasteries built in the Alps to shelter humans became tourist destinations. The Benedictines had built monasteries in Lucerne, and Oberammergau. The Cistercians built their temple at Lake Constance. Meanwhile, the Augustinians maintained abbeys in Savoy and one in Interlaken.

=== Exploration ===

Radiocarbon-dated charcoal placed around 50,000 years ago was found in the &quot;Drachloch&quot; (Dragon&#x27;s Hole) cave above the village of Vattis in the canton of St. Gallen, proving that the high peaks were visited by prehistoric people. Seven bear skulls from the cave may have been buried by the same prehistoric people. The peaks, however, were mostly ignored except for a few notable examples, and long left to the exclusive attention of the people of the adjoining valleys. The mountain peaks were seen as terrifying, the abode of dragons and demons, to the point that people blindfolded themselves to cross the Alpine passes. The glaciers remained a mystery and many still believed the highest areas to be inhabited by dragons.

Charles VII of France ordered his chamberlain to climb Mont Aiguille in 1356. The knight reached the summit of Rocciamelone where he left a bronze triptych of three crosses, a feat which he conducted with the use of ladders to traverse the ice. In 1492, Antoine de Ville climbed Mont Aiguille, without reaching the summit, an experience he described as &quot;horrifying and terrifying.&quot; Leonardo da Vinci was fascinated by variations of light in the higher altitudes, and climbed a mountain—scholars are uncertain which one; some believe it may have been Monte Rosa. From his description of a &quot;blue like that of a gentian&quot; sky it is thought that he reached a significantly high altitude. In the 18th century four Chamonix men almost made the summit of Mont Blanc but were overcome by altitude sickness and snowblindness.
Conrad Gessner was the first naturalist to ascend the mountains in the 16th century, to study them, writing that in the mountains he found the &quot;theatre of the Lord&quot;. By the 19th century more naturalists began to arrive to explore, study and conquer the high peaks. Two men who first explored the regions of ice and snow were Horace-Bénédict de Saussure (1740–1799) in the Pennine Alps, and the Benedictine monk of Disentis Placidus a Spescha (1752–1833). Born in Geneva, Saussure was enamoured with the mountains from an early age; he left a law career to become a naturalist and spent many years trekking through the Bernese Oberland, the Savoy, the Piedmont and Valais, studying the glaciers and geology, as he became an early proponent of the theory of rock upheaval. Saussure, in 1787, was a member of the third ascent of Mont Blanc—today the summits of all the peaks have been climbed.

=== The Romantics and Alpinists ===

Albrecht von Haller&#x27;s poem &quot;Die Alpen&quot;, published in 1732 described the mountains as an area of mythical purity. Jean-Jacques Rousseau presented the Alps as a place of allure and beauty, in his novel &quot;Julie, or the New Heloise&quot;, published in 1761. Later the first wave of Romanticism such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, and J. M. W. Turner came to admire the Alpine scenery; Wordsworth visited the area in 1790, writing of his experiences in &quot;The Prelude&quot; (1799). Schiller later wrote the play &quot;William Tell&quot; (1804), which tells the story of the legendary Swiss marksman William Tell as part of the greater Swiss struggle for independence from the Habsburg Empire in the early 14th century. At the end of the Napoleonic Wars, the Alpine countries began to see an influx of poets, artists, and musicians, as visitors came to experience the sublime effects of monumental nature.

In 1816, Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley and his wife Mary Shelley visited Geneva and all three were inspired by the scenery in their writings. During these visits Shelley wrote the poem &quot;Mont Blanc&quot;, Byron wrote &quot;The Prisoner of Chillon&quot; and the dramatic poem &quot;Manfred&quot;, and Mary Shelley, who found the scenery overwhelming, conceived the idea for the novel &quot;Frankenstein&quot; in her villa on the shores of Lake Geneva amid a thunderstorm. When Coleridge travelled to Chamonix, he declaimed, in defiance of Shelley, who had signed himself &quot;Atheos&quot; in the guestbook of the Hotel de Londres near Montenvers, &quot;Who would be, who could be an atheist in this valley of wonders&quot;.

By the mid-19th century scientists began to arrive en masse to study the geology and ecology of the region.

From the beginning of the 19th century, the tourism and mountaineering development of the Alps began. In the early years of the &quot;golden age of alpinism&quot; initially scientific activities were mixed with sport, for example by the physicist John Tyndall, with the first ascent of the Matterhorn by Edward Whymper being the highlight. In the later years, the &quot;silver age of alpinism&quot;, the focus was on mountain sports and climbing. The first president of the Alpine Club, John Ball, is considered the discoverer of the Dolomites, which for decades were the focus of climbers like Paul Grohmann, Michael Innerkofler and Angelo Dibona.

=== The Nazis ===
In autumn 1932, Adolf Hitler commissioned the first of a series of refurbishments, which eventually turned a mountain cottage, later named Berghof, into a fortified citadel. This domestic, but representative, fortification had two small bedrooms, and a full bathroom, planned by the Munich architect and NSDAP member Josef Neumaier. Guests, such as Rudolf Hess, stayed over, sleeping in tents or over the garage.

The Alps, Adolf Hitler, and improbable powerful organizations have been subject to crime fiction. The Alps acted as a geographical barrier to Italy, and the Alps for centuries were permeated with established smuggling routes, known as &quot;green line&quot;. After World War II, members of the Schutzstaffel that feared prosecution as war criminals, known in modern English only as &quot;SS&quot;, disappeared into a crowd of refugees. Massive numbers of refugees entered Italy illegally, by navigating the Alps.

=== Undocumented migrants ===
Smugglers of humans claim that crossing the Alps is less dangerous, or deadly, than traveling 355 km on water between Tripoli and Lampedusa with a tramp ship (&quot;carretta del mare&quot;) or a dinghy. Undocumented migrants, visa overstayers, false tourists, asylum seekers, and other clandestine humans, lose their lives crossing the Alps. The exact number of smuggled humans who die a brutal death in the Alps can only be estimated.

==Largest Alpine cities==
The largest city within the Alps is the city of Grenoble in France. Other larger and important cities within the Alps with over 100,000 inhabitants are in Tyrol with Bolzano/Bozen (Italy), Trento (Italy) and Innsbruck (Austria). Larger cities outside the Alps are Milan, Verona, Turin (Italy), Munich (Germany), Graz, Vienna, Salzburg (Austria), Ljubljana, Maribor, Kranj (Slovenia), Zurich, Geneva (Switzerland), Nice and Lyon (France).

Cities with over 100,000 inhabitants in the Alps are:
== Alpine people and culture ==
The population of the region is 14 million spread across eight countries. On the rim of the mountains, on the plateaus, and on the plains the economy consists of manufacturing and service jobs whereas in the higher altitudes and the mountains farming is still essential to the economy. Farming and forestry continue to be mainstays of Alpine culture, industries that provide for export to the cities and maintain the mountain ecology.

The Alpine regions are multicultural and linguistically diverse. Dialects are common and vary from valley to valley and region to region. In the Slavic Alps alone 19 dialects have been identified. Some of the Romance dialects spoken in the French, Swiss and Italian alps of Aosta Valley derive from Arpitan, while the southern part of the western range is related to Occitan; the German dialects derive from Germanic tribal languages. Romansh, spoken by two percent of the population in southeast Switzerland, is an ancient Rhaeto-Romanic language derived from Latin, remnants of ancient Celtic languages and perhaps Etruscan.
Much of the Alpine culture is unchanged since the medieval period when skills that guaranteed survival in the mountain valleys and the highest villages became mainstays, leading to strong traditions of carpentry, woodcarving, baking, pastry-making, and cheesemaking.

Farming has been a traditional occupation for centuries, although it became less dominant in the 20th century with the advent of tourism. Grazing and pasture land are limited because of the steep and rocky topography of the Alps. In mid-June, cows are moved to the highest pastures close to the snowline, where they are watched by herdsmen who stay in the high altitudes often living in stone huts or wooden barns during the summers. Villagers celebrate the day the cows are herded up to the pastures and again when they return in mid-September. The Almabtrieb, Alpabzug, Alpabfahrt, Désalpes (&quot;coming down from the alps&quot;) is celebrated by decorating the cows with garlands and enormous cowbells while the farmers dress in traditional costumes.

Cheesemaking is an ancient tradition in most Alpine countries. A wheel of cheese from the Emmental in Switzerland can weigh up to , and the Beaufort in Savoy can weigh up to . Owners of the cows traditionally receive from the cheesemakers a portion about the proportion of the cows&#x27; milk from the summer months in the high alps. Haymaking is an important farming activity in mountain villages that have become somewhat mechanized in recent years, although the slopes are so steep that scythes are usually necessary to cut the grass. Hay is normally brought in twice a year, often also on festival days.

In the high villages, people live in homes built according to medieval designs that withstand cold winters. The kitchen is separated from the living area (called the &quot;stube&quot;, the area of the home heated by a stove), and second-floor bedrooms benefit from rising heat. The typical Swiss chalet originated in the Bernese Oberland. Chalets often face south or downhill and are built of solid wood, with a steeply gabled roof to allow accumulated snow to slide off easily. Stairs leading to upper levels are sometimes built on the outside, and balconies are sometimes enclosed.
Food is passed from the kitchen to the stube, where the dining room table is placed. Some meals are communal, such as fondue, where a pot is set in the middle of the table for each person to dip into. Other meals are still served traditionally on carved wooden plates. Furniture has been traditionally elaborately carved and in many Alpine countries, carpentry skills are passed from generation to generation.

Roofs are traditionally constructed from Alpine rocks such as pieces of schist, gneiss, or slate. Such chalets are typically found in the higher parts of the valleys, as in the Maurienne valley in Savoy, where the amount of snow during the cold months is important. The inclination of the roof cannot exceed 40%, allowing the snow to stay on top, thereby functioning as insulation from the cold. In the lower areas where the forests are widespread, wooden tiles are traditionally used. Commonly made of Norway spruce, they are called &quot;tavaillon&quot;.

In the German-speaking parts of the Alps (Austria, Bavaria, South Tyrol, Liechtenstein and Switzerland) and also Slovenia, there is a strong tradition of Alpine folk culture. Old traditions are carefully maintained among inhabitants of Alpine areas, even though this is seldom obvious to the visitor: many people are members of cultural associations where the Alpine folk culture is cultivated. At cultural events, traditional folk costume (in German &quot;Tracht&quot;) is expected: typically lederhosen for men and dirndls for women. Visitors can get a glimpse of the rich customs of the Alps at public Volksfeste. Even when large events feature only a little folk culture, all participants take part with gusto. Good opportunities to see local people celebrating the traditional culture occur at the many fairs, wine festivals, and firefighting festivals which fill weekends in the countryside from spring to autumn. Alpine festivals vary from country to country. Frequently they include music (e.g. the playing of Alpenhorns), dance (e.g. Schuhplattler), sports (e.g. wrestling marches and archery), as well as traditions with pagan roots such as the lighting of fires on Walpurgis Night and Saint John&#x27;s Eve. Many areas celebrate Fastnacht in the weeks before Lent. Folk costume also continues to be worn for most weddings and festivals.

== Tourism ==

The Alps are one of the more popular tourist destinations in the world with many resorts such as Oberstdorf, in Bavaria, Saalbach in Austria, Davos in Switzerland, Chamonix in France, and Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo in Italy recording more than a million annual visitors. With over 120 million visitors a year, tourism is integral to the Alpine economy with much of it coming from winter sports, although summer visitors are also an important component.

The tourism industry began in the early 19th century when foreigners visited the Alps, travelled to the bases of the mountains to enjoy the scenery, and stayed at the spa-resorts. Large hotels were built during the Belle Époque; cog-railways, built early in the 20th century, brought tourists to ever-higher elevations, with the Jungfraubahn terminating at the Jungfraujoch, well above the eternal snow-line, after going through a tunnel in Eiger. During this period winter sports were slowly introduced: in 1882 the first figure skating championship was held in St. Moritz, and downhill skiing became a popular sport with English visitors early in the 20th century, as the first ski-lift was installed in 1908 above Grindelwald.

In the first half of the 20th century the Olympic Winter Games were held three times in Alpine venues: the 1924 Winter Olympics in Chamonix, France; the 1928 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz, Switzerland; and the 1936 Winter Olympics in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany. During World War II the winter games were cancelled but after that time the Winter Games have been held in St. Moritz (1948), Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo (1956), Innsbruck, Austria (1964 and 1976), Grenoble, France, (1968), Albertville, France, (1992), and Turin (2006). In 1930, the &quot;Lauberhorn Rennen&quot; (Lauberhorn Race), was run for the first time on the Lauberhorn above Wengen; the equally demanding Hahnenkamm was first run in the same year in Kitzbühl, Austria. Both races continue to be held each January on successive weekends. The Lauberhorn is the more strenuous downhill race at and poses danger to racers who reach within seconds of leaving the start gate.

During the post-World War I period, ski lifts were built in Swiss and Austrian towns to accommodate winter visitors, and summer tourism continued to be important. By the mid-20th century the popularity of downhill skiing increased greatly as it became more accessible and in the 1970s several new villages were built in France devoted almost exclusively to skiing, such as Les Menuires. Until this point, Austria and Switzerland had been the traditional and more popular destinations for winter sports, and by the end of the 20th century and into the early 21st century, France, Italy, and Tyrol began to see increases in winter visitors. Since the 1980s tourism expansion and easy global access generate grave concerns regarding the loss of traditional Alpine culture and many uncertainties about sustainable development. As a likely result of climatic change, the number of high altitude ski resorts and piste km is in decline since 2015, with snow-making machines installed at many sites.

== Transportation ==
The region is serviced by of roads used by six million vehicles per year. Train travel is well established in the Alps, with, for instance of track for every in a country such as Switzerland. Most of Europe&#x27;s highest railways are located there. In 2007, the new Lötschberg Base Tunnel was opened, which circumvents the 100 years older Lötschberg Tunnel. With the opening of the Gotthard Base Tunnel on June 1, 2016, it bypasses the Gotthard Tunnel built in the 19th century and realizes the first flat route through the Alps.

Some high mountain villages are car-free either because of inaccessibility or by choice. Wengen, and Zermatt (in Switzerland) are accessible only by cable car or cog-rail trains. Avoriaz (in France), is car-free, with other Alpine villages considering becoming car-free zones or limiting the number of cars for reasons of sustainability of the fragile Alpine terrain.

The lower regions and larger towns of the Alps are well-served by motorways and main roads, but higher mountain passes and byroads, which are amongst the highest in Europe, can be treacherous even in summer due to steep slopes. Many passes are closed in winter. Several airports around the Alps (and some within), as well as long-distance rail links from all neighbouring countries, afford large numbers of travellers easy access.

<doc id="983" wikidata="Q34670" url="?curid=983" title="Albert Camus">
<text>Albert Camus ( ; ; 7 November 1913 – 4 January 1960) was a French philosopher, author, dramatist, journalist, world federalist, and political activist. He was the recipient of the 1957 Nobel Prize in Literature at the age of 44, the second-youngest recipient in history. His works include &quot;The Stranger&quot;, &quot;The Plague&quot;, &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus&quot;, &quot;The Fall&quot; and &quot;The Rebel&quot;.

Camus was born in French Algeria to &quot;pied-noir&quot; parents. He spent his childhood in a poor neighbourhood and later studied philosophy at the University of Algiers. He was in Paris when the Germans invaded France during World War II in 1940. Camus tried to flee but finally joined the French Resistance where he served as editor-in-chief at &quot;Combat&quot;, an outlawed newspaper. After the war, he was a celebrity figure and gave many lectures around the world. He married twice but had many extramarital affairs. Camus was politically active; he was part of the left that opposed Joseph Stalin and the Soviet Union because of their totalitarianism. Camus was a moralist and leaned towards anarcho-syndicalism. He was part of many organisations seeking European integration. During the Algerian War (1954–1962), he kept a neutral stance, advocating a multicultural and pluralistic Algeria, a position that was rejected by most parties.

Philosophically, Camus&#x27;s views contributed to the rise of the philosophy known as absurdism. Some consider Camus&#x27;s work to show him to be an existentialist, even though he himself firmly rejected the term throughout his lifetime.

==Biography==
===Early years and education===

Albert Camus was born on 7 November 1913 in a working-class neighbourhood in Mondovi (present-day Dréan), in French Algeria. His mother, Catherine Hélène Camus (), was French with Balearic Spanish ancestry. She was deaf and illiterate. He never knew his father, Lucien Camus, a poor French agricultural worker killed in action while serving with a Zouave regiment in October 1914, during World War I. Camus, his mother, and other relatives lived without many basic material possessions during his childhood in the Belcourt section of Algiers. Camus was a second-generation French inhabitant of Algeria, which was a French territory from 1830 until 1962. His paternal grandfather, along with many others of his generation, had moved to Algeria for a better life during the first decades of the 19th century. Hence, he was called a – a slang term for people of French and other European descent born in Algeria. His identity and poor background had a substantial effect on his later life. Nevertheless, Camus was a French citizen and enjoyed more rights than Arab and Berber Algerians under . During his childhood, he developed a love for football and swimming.

Under the influence of his teacher Louis Germain, Camus gained a scholarship in 1924 to continue his studies at a prestigious lyceum (secondary school) near Algiers. Germain immediately noticed his lively intelligence and his desire to learn. In middle school, he gave Camus free lessons to prepare him for the 1924 scholarship competition – despite the fact that his grandmother had a plan for him to be a manual worker so that he could immediately contribute to the maintenance of the family. Camus maintained great gratitude and affection towards Louis Germain throughout his life and he dedicated his speech for accepting the Nobel Prize to Germain. Having received the news of the awarding of the prize, he wrote: 

But when I heard the news, my first thought, after my mother, was of you. Without you, without the affectionate hand you extended to the small poor child that I was, without your teaching and example, none of all this would have happened.

In a letter dated 30 April 1959, Germain lovingly reciprocated the warm feelings towards his former pupil, calling him &quot;my little Camus&quot;.

In 1930, at the age of 17, Camus was diagnosed with tuberculosis. Because it is a transmitted disease, he moved out of his home and stayed with his uncle Gustave Acault, a butcher, who influenced the young Camus. It was at that time he turned to philosophy, with the mentoring of his philosophy teacher Jean Grenier. He was impressed by ancient Greek philosophers and Friedrich Nietzsche. During that time, he was only able to study part time. To earn money, he took odd jobs, including as a private tutor, car parts clerk, and assistant at the Meteorological Institute.

In 1933, Camus enrolled at the University of Algiers and completed his &quot;licence de philosophie&quot; (BA) in 1936 after presenting his thesis on Plotinus. Camus developed an interest in early Christian philosophers, but Nietzsche and Arthur Schopenhauer had paved the way towards pessimism and atheism. Camus also studied novelist-philosophers such as Stendhal, Herman Melville, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, and Franz Kafka. In 1933, he also met Simone Hié, then a partner of Camus&#x27;s friend, who later became his first wife.

Camus played as goalkeeper for the Racing Universitaire d&#x27;Alger junior team from 1928 to 1930. The sense of team spirit, fraternity, and common purpose appealed to him enormously. In match reports, he was often praised for playing with passion and courage. Any football ambitions, however, disappeared when he contracted tuberculosis. Camus drew parallels among football, human existence, morality, and personal identity. For him, the simplistic morality of football contradicted the complicated morality imposed by authorities such as the state and church.

===Formative years===
In 1934, Camus was in a relationship with Simone Hié. Simone had an addiction to morphine, a drug she used to ease her menstrual pains. His uncle Gustave did not approve of the relationship, but Camus married Hié to help her fight the addiction. He subsequently discovered she was in a relationship with her doctor at the same time and the couple later divorced.

Camus joined the French Communist Party (PCF) in early 1935. He saw it as a way to &quot;fight inequalities between Europeans and &#x27;natives&#x27; in Algeria&quot;, even though he was not a Marxist. He explained: &quot;We might see communism as a springboard and asceticism that prepares the ground for more spiritual activities.&quot; Camus left the PCF a year later. In 1936, the independence-minded Algerian Communist Party (PCA) was founded, and Camus joined it after his mentor Grenier advised him to do so. Camus&#x27;s main role within the PCA was to organise the (&#x27;Workers&#x27; Theatre&#x27;). Camus was also close to the (Algerian People&#x27;s Party [PPA]), which was a moderate anti-colonialist/nationalist party. As tensions in the interwar period escalated, the Stalinist PCA and PPA broke ties. Camus was expelled from the PCA for refusing to toe the party line. This series of events sharpened his belief in human dignity. Camus&#x27;s mistrust of bureaucracies that aimed for efficiency instead of justice grew. He continued his involvement with theatre and renamed his group (&#x27;Theatre of the Team&#x27;). Some of his scripts were the basis for his later novels.

In 1938, Camus began working for the leftist newspaper (founded by Pascal Pia), as he had strong anti-fascist feelings, and the rise of fascist regimes in Europe was worrying him. By then, Camus had also developed strong feelings against authoritarian colonialism as he witnessed the harsh treatment of the Arabs and Berbers by French authorities. was banned in 1940 and Camus flew to Paris to take a new job at as layout editor. In Paris, he almost completed his &quot;first cycle&quot; of works dealing with the absurd and the meaningless: the novel &quot;L&#x27;Étranger&quot; (&quot;The Outsider&quot; [UK] or &quot;The Stranger&quot; [US]), the philosophical essay &quot;Le Mythe de Sisyphe&quot; (&quot;The Myth of Sisyphus&quot;), and the play &quot;Caligula&quot;. Each cycle consisted of a novel, an essay, and a theatrical play.

===World War II, Resistance and &quot;Combat&quot;===
Soon after Camus moved to Paris, the outbreak of World War II began to affect France. Camus volunteered to join the army but was not accepted because he had once had tuberculosis. As the Germans were marching towards Paris, Camus fled. He was laid off from and ended up in Lyon, where he married pianist and mathematician Francine Faure on 3 December 1940. Camus and Faure moved back to Algeria (Oran), where he taught in primary schools. Because of his tuberculosis, he moved to the French Alps on medical advice. There he began writing his second cycle of works, this time dealing with revolt – a novel, &quot;La Peste&quot; (&quot;The Plague&quot;), and a play, &quot;Le Malentendu&quot; (&quot;The Misunderstanding&quot;). By 1943 he was known because of his earlier work. He returned to Paris, where he met and became friends with Jean-Paul Sartre. He also became part of a circle of intellectuals, which included Simone de Beauvoir and André Breton. Among them was the actress María Casares, who later had an affair with Camus.

Camus took an active role in the underground resistance movement against the Germans during the French Occupation. Upon his arrival in Paris, he started working as a journalist and editor of the banned newspaper &quot;Combat&quot;. Camus used a pseudonym for his &quot;Combat&quot; articles and used false ID cards to avoid being captured. He continued writing for the paper after the liberation of France, composing almost daily editorials under his real name. During that period he composed four &quot;Lettres à un Ami Allemand&quot; (&#x27;Letters to a German Friend&#x27;), explaining why resistance was necessary.

===Post–World War II===
After the War, Camus lived in Paris with Faure, who gave birth to twins, Catherine and Jean, in 1945. Camus was now a celebrated writer known for his role in the Resistance. He gave lectures at various universities in the United States and Latin America during two separate trips. He also visited Algeria once more, only to leave disappointed by the continued oppressive colonial policies, which he had warned about many times. During this period he completed the second cycle of his work, with the book (&quot;The Rebel&quot;). Camus attacked totalitarian communism while advocating libertarian socialism and anarcho-syndicalism. Upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France with its rejection of communism, the book brought about the final split between Camus and Sartre. His relations with the Marxist Left deteriorated further during the Algerian War.

Camus was a strong supporter of European integration in various marginal organisations working towards that end. In 1944, he founded the (&#x27;French Committee for the European Federation&#x27; [CFFE]), declaring that Europe &quot;can only evolve along the path of economic progress, democracy, and peace if the nation-states become a federation.&quot; In 1947–48, he founded the (GLI), a trade union movement in the context of revolutionary syndicalism (). His main aim was to express the positive side of surrealism and existentialism, rejecting the negativity and the nihilism of André Breton. Camus also raised his voice against the Soviet invasion of Hungary and the totalitarian tendencies of Franco&#x27;s regime in Spain.

Camus had numerous affairs, particularly an irregular and eventually public affair with the Spanish-born actress María Casares, with whom he had extensive correspondence. Faure did not take this affair lightly. She had a mental breakdown and needed hospitalisation in the early 1950s. Camus, who felt guilty, withdrew from public life and was slightly depressed for some time.

In 1957, Camus received the news that he was to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. This came as a shock to him; he anticipated André Malraux would win the award. At age 44, he was the second-youngest recipient of the prize, after Rudyard Kipling, who was 41. After this he began working on his autobiography (&quot;The First Man&quot;) in an attempt to examine &quot;moral learning&quot;. He also turned to the theatre once more. Financed by the money he received with his Nobel Prize, he adapted and directed for the stage Dostoyevsky&#x27;s novel &quot;Demons&quot;. The play opened in January 1959 at the Antoine Theatre in Paris and was a critical success.

During these years, he published posthumously the works of the philosopher Simone Weil, in the series &quot;Espoir&quot; (&#x27;Hope&#x27;) which he had founded for Éditions Gallimard. Weil had great influence on his philosophy, since he saw her writings as an &quot;antidote&quot; to nihilism. Camus described her as &quot;the only great spirit of our times&quot;.

=== Death ===

Camus died on 4 January 1960 at the age of 46, in a car accident near Sens, in Le Grand Fossard in the small town of Villeblevin. He had spent the New Year&#x27;s holiday of 1960 at his house in Lourmarin, Vaucluse with his family and his publisher Michel Gallimard of Éditions Gallimard, along with Gallimard&#x27;s wife, Janine, and daughter, Anne. Camus&#x27;s wife and children went back to Paris by train on 2 January, but Camus decided to return in Gallimard&#x27;s luxurious Facel Vega FV2. The car crashed into a plane tree on a long straight stretch of the Route nationale 5 (now the RN 6 or D606). Camus, who was in the passenger seat, died instantly, while Gallimard died five days later. Janine and Anne Gallimard escaped without injuries.

144 pages of a handwritten manuscript entitled &quot;Le premier Homme&quot; (&#x27;The First Man&#x27;) were found in the wreckage. Camus had predicted that this unfinished novel based on his childhood in Algeria would be his finest work. Camus was buried in the Lourmarin Cemetery, Vaucluse, France, where he had lived. Jean-Paul Sartre read a eulogy, paying tribute to Camus&#x27;s heroic &quot;stubborn humanism&quot;. William Faulkner wrote his obituary, saying, &quot;When the door shut for him he had already written on this side of it that which every artist who also carries through life with him that one same foreknowledge and hatred of death is hoping to do: I was here.&quot;

==Literary career==
Camus&#x27;s first publication was a play called (&quot;Revolt in the Asturias&quot;), written with three friends in May 1936. The subject was the 1934 revolt by Spanish miners that was brutally suppressed by the Spanish government, resulting in 1,500 to 2,000 deaths. In May 1937 he wrote his first book, (&quot;Betwixt and Between&quot;, also translated as &quot;The Wrong Side and the Right Side&quot;). Both were published by Edmond Charlot&#x27;s small publishing house.
Camus separated his work into three cycles. Each cycle consisted of a novel, an essay, and a play. The first was the cycle of the absurd consisting of &quot;L&#x27;Étranger&quot;, &quot;Le Mythe de Sysiphe&quot;, and &quot;Caligula&quot;. The second was the cycle of the revolt which included &quot;La Peste&quot; (&quot;The Plague&quot;), &quot;L&#x27;Homme révolté&quot; (&quot;The Rebel&quot;), and &quot;Les Justes&quot; (&quot;The Just Assassins&quot;). The third, the cycle of the love, consisted of &quot;Nemesis&quot;. Each cycle was an examination of a theme with the use of a pagan myth and including biblical motifs.

The books in the first cycle were published between 1942 and 1944, but the theme was conceived earlier, at least as far back as 1936. With this cycle, Camus aimed to pose a question on the human condition, discuss the world as an absurd place, and warn humanity of the consequences of totalitarianism.

Camus began his work on the second cycle while he was in Algeria, in the last months of 1942, just as the Germans were reaching North Africa. In the second cycle, Camus used Prometheus, who is depicted as a revolutionary humanist, to highlight the nuances between revolution and rebellion. He analyses various aspects of rebellion, its metaphysics, and its connection to politics, and then examines it under the lens of modernity, historicity, and the absence of a God.

After receiving the Nobel Prize, Camus gathered, clarified, and published his pacifist leaning views at (&quot;Algerian Chronicles&quot;). He then decided to distance himself from the Algerian War as he found the mental burden too heavy. He turned to theatre and the third cycle which was about love and the goddess Nemesis, the Greek and Roman goddess of Revenge.

Two of Camus&#x27;s works were published posthumously. The first entitled &quot;La mort heureuse&quot; (&quot;A Happy Death&quot;) (1971) is a novel that was written between 1936 and 1938. It features a character named Patrice Mersault, comparable to &quot;The Stranger&quot;″s Meursault. There is scholarly debate about the relationship between the two books. The second was an unfinished novel, &quot;Le Premier homme&quot; (&quot;The First Man&quot;, published in 1994), which Camus was writing before he died. It was an autobiographical work about his childhood in Algeria and its publication in 1994 sparked a widespread reconsideration of Camus&#x27;s allegedly unrepentant colonialism.
==Political stance==
Camus was a moralist; he claimed morality should guide politics. While he did not deny that morals change over time, he rejected the classical Marxist view that historical material relations define morality.

Camus was also strongly critical of Marxism–Leninism, which he considered totalitarian, especially in the case of the Soviet Union. Camus rebuked those sympathetic to the Soviet model and their &quot;decision to call total servitude freedom&quot;. A proponent of libertarian socialism, he stated that the Soviet Union was not socialist and the United States was not liberal. His critique of the Soviet Union caused him to clash with others on the political left, most notably with his on-again/off-again friend Jean-Paul Sartre.

Active in the French Resistance to the Nazi occupation of France during World War II, Camus wrote for and edited the Resistance journal &quot;Combat&quot;. Of the French collaboration with the German occupiers, he wrote: &quot;Now the only moral value is courage, which is useful here for judging the puppets and chatterboxes who pretend to speak in the name of the people.&quot; After France&#x27;s liberation, Camus remarked: &quot;This country does not need a Talleyrand, but a Saint-Just.&quot; The reality of the postwar tribunals soon changed his mind: Camus publicly reversed himself and became a lifelong opponent of capital punishment.

Camus had anarchist sympathies, which intensified in the 1950s, when he came to believe that the Soviet model was morally bankrupt. Camus was firmly against any kind of exploitation, authority, or property, as well as the State and centralization. However, he opposed revolution, separating the rebel from the revolutionary and believing that the belief in &quot;absolute truth&quot;, most often assuming the guise of history or reason, inspires the revolutionary and leads to tragic results. He believed that rebellion is spurred by our outrage over the world&#x27;s lack of transcendent significance, while political rebellion is our response to attacks against the dignity and autonomy of the individual. Camus opposed political violence, tolerating it only in rare and very narrowly defined instances, as well as revolutionary terror, which he accused of sacrificing innocent lives on the altar of history.

Philosophy professor David Sherman considers Camus an anarcho-syndicalist. Graeme Nicholson considers Camus an existentialist anarchist.

The anarchist André Prudhommeaux first introduced him at a meeting of the (&#x27;Anarchist Student Circle&#x27;) in 1948 as a sympathiser familiar with anarchist thought. Camus wrote for anarchist publications such as (&#x27;The Libertarian&#x27;), (&#x27;The Proletarian Revolution&#x27;), and (&#x27;Workers&#x27; Solidarity&#x27;), the organ of the anarcho-syndicalist Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT, &#x27;National Confederation of Labor&#x27;).

Camus kept a neutral stance during the Algerian Revolution (1954–1962). While he was against the violence of the National Liberation Front (FLN), he acknowledged the injustice and brutalities imposed by colonialist France. He was supportive of Pierre Mendès France&#x27;s Unified Socialist Party (PSU) and its approach to the crisis; Mendès France advocated for reconciliation. Camus also supported a like-minded Algerian militant, Aziz Kessous. Camus traveled to Algeria to negotiate a truce between the two belligerents but was met with distrust by all parties. In one often-misquoted incident, Camus confronted an Algerian critic during his 1957 Nobel Prize acceptance speech in Stockholm, rejecting the false equivalence of justice with revolutionary terrorism: &quot;People are now planting bombs in the tramways of Algiers. My mother might be on one of those tramways. If that is justice, then I prefer my mother.&quot; Critics have labelled the response as reactionary and a result of a colonialist attitude.

Camus was sharply critical of the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In the 1950s, Camus devoted his efforts to human rights. In 1952, he resigned from his work for UNESCO when the UN accepted Spain, under the leadership of the caudillo General Francisco Franco, as a member. Camus maintained his pacifism and resisted capital punishment anywhere in the world. He wrote an essay against capital punishment in collaboration with Arthur Koestler, the writer, intellectual, and founder of the League Against Capital Punishment, entitled (&#x27;Reflections on Capital Punishment&#x27;), published by Calmann-Levy in 1957.

Along with Albert Einstein, Camus was one of the sponsors of the Peoples&#x27; World Convention (PWC), also known as Peoples&#x27; World Constituent Assembly (PWCA), which took place between 1950 and 1951 at Palais Electoral in Geneva, Switzerland.

==Role in Algeria==
Born in Algeria to French parents, Camus was familiar with the institutional racism of France against Arabs and Berbers, but he was not part of a rich elite. He lived in very poor conditions as a child, but was a citizen of France and as such was entitled to citizens&#x27; rights; members of the country&#x27;s Arab and Berber majority were not.

Camus was a vocal advocate of the &quot;new Mediterranean Culture&quot;. This was his vision of embracing the multi-ethnicity of the Algerian people, in opposition to &quot;Latiny&quot;, a popular pro-fascist and antisemitic ideology among other &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; – French or Europeans born in Algeria. For Camus, this vision encapsulated the Hellenic humanism which survived among ordinary people around the Mediterranean Sea. His 1938 address on &quot;The New Mediterranean Culture&quot; represents Camus&#x27;s most systematic statement of his views at this time. Camus also supported the Blum–Viollette proposal to grant Algerians full French citizenship in a manifesto with arguments defending this assimilative proposal on radical egalitarian grounds. In 1939, Camus wrote a stinging series of articles for the on the atrocious living conditions of the inhabitants of the Kabylie highlands. He advocated for economic, educational, and political reforms as a matter of emergency.

In 1945, following the Sétif and Guelma massacre after Arabs revolted against French mistreatment, Camus was one of only a few mainland journalists to visit the colony. He wrote a series of articles reporting on conditions and advocating for French reforms and concessions to the demands of the Algerian people.

When the Algerian War began in 1954, Camus was confronted with a moral dilemma. He identified with the &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; such as his own parents and defended the French government&#x27;s actions against the revolt. He argued the Algerian uprising was an integral part of the &quot;new Arab imperialism&quot; led by Egypt and an &quot;anti-Western&quot; offensive orchestrated by Russia to &quot;encircle Europe&quot; and &quot;isolate the United States&quot;. Although favoring greater Algerian autonomy or even federation, though not full-scale independence, he believed the &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; and Arabs could co-exist. During the war, he advocated a civil truce that would spare the civilians. It was rejected by both sides, who regarded it as foolish. Behind the scenes, he began working for imprisoned Algerians who faced the death penalty. His position drew much criticism from the left and later postcolonial literary critics, such as Edward Said, who were opposed to European imperialism and charged that Camus&#x27;s novels and short stories are plagued with colonial depictions – or conscious erasures – of Algeria&#x27;s Arab population. In their eyes, Camus was no longer the defender of the oppressed.

Camus once said that the troubles in Algeria &quot;affected him as others feel pain in their lungs&quot;.

==Philosophy==
===Existentialism===
Even though Camus is mostly connected to absurdism, he is routinely categorized as an existentialist, a term he rejected on several occasions.

Camus himself said his philosophical origins lay in ancient Greek philosophy, Nietzsche, and 17th-century moralists, whereas existentialism arose from 19th- and early 20th-century philosophy such as Søren Kierkegaard, Karl Jaspers, and Martin Heidegger. He also said his work, &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus&quot;, was a criticism of various aspects of existentialism. Camus rejected existentialism as a philosophy, but his critique was mostly focused on Sartrean existentialism and – though to a lesser extent – on religious existentialism. He thought that the importance of history held by Marx and Sartre was incompatible with his belief in human freedom. David Sherman and others also suggest the rivalry between Sartre and Camus also played a part in his rejection of existentialism. David Simpson argues further that his humanism and belief in human nature set him apart from the existentialist doctrine that existence precedes essence.

On the other hand, Camus focused most of his philosophy around existential questions. The absurdity of life and that it inevitably ends in death is highlighted in his acts. His belief was that the absurd – life being void of meaning, or man&#x27;s inability to know that meaning if it were to exist – was something that man should embrace. His opposition to Christianity and his commitment to individual moral freedom and responsibility are only a few of the similarities with other existential writers. Camus addressed one of the fundamental questions of existentialism: the problem of suicide. He wrote: &quot;There is only one really serious philosophical question, and that is suicide.&quot;
Camus viewed the question of suicide as arising naturally as a solution to the absurdity of life.

===Absurdism===
Many existentialist writers have addressed the Absurd, each with their own interpretation of what it is and what makes it important. Kierkegaard suggests that the absurdity of religious truths prevents people from reaching God rationally. Sartre recognizes the absurdity of individual experience. Camus&#x27;s thoughts on the Absurd begin with his first cycle of books and the literary essay &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus&quot;, his major work on the subject. In 1942, he published the story of a man living an absurd life in &quot;The Stranger&quot;. He also wrote a play about the Roman emperor Caligula, pursuing an absurd logic, which was not performed until 1945. His early thoughts appeared in his first collection of essays, &quot;Betwixt and Between&quot;, in 1937. Absurd themes were expressed with more sophistication in his second collection of essays, (&quot;Nuptials&quot;) in 1938. In these essays, Camus reflects on the experience of the Absurd. Aspects of the notion of the Absurd can also be found in &quot;The Plague&quot;.
Camus follows Sartre&#x27;s definition of the Absurd: &quot;That which is meaningless. Thus man&#x27;s existence is absurd because his contingency finds no external justification&quot;. The Absurd is created because man, who is placed in an unintelligent universe, realises that human values are not founded on a solid external component; as Camus himself explains, the Absurd is the result of the &quot;confrontation between human need and the unreasonable silence of the world&quot;. Even though absurdity is inescapable, Camus does not drift towards nihilism. But the realization of absurdity leads to the question: Why should someone continue to live? Suicide is an option that Camus firmly dismisses as the renunciation of human values and freedom. Rather, he proposes we accept that absurdity is a part of our lives and live with it.

The turning point in Camus&#x27;s attitude to the Absurd occurs in a collection of four letters to an anonymous German friend, written between July 1943 and July 1944. The first was published in the in 1943, the second in the in 1944, and the third in the newspaper , in 1945. The four letters were published as (&#x27;Letters to a German Friend&#x27;) in 1945, and were included in the collection &quot;Resistance, Rebellion, and Death&quot;.

Camus regretted the continued reference to himself as a &quot;philosopher of the absurd&quot;. He showed less interest in the Absurd shortly after publishing &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus&quot;. To distinguish his ideas, scholars sometimes refer to the Paradox of the Absurd, when referring to &quot;Camus&#x27;s Absurd&quot;.

===Revolt===
Camus articulated the case for revolting against any kind of oppression, injustice, or whatever disrespects the human condition. He was cautious enough, however, to set the limits on the rebellion. &quot;The Rebel&quot; explains in detail his thoughts on the issue. There, he builds upon the absurd, described in &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus&quot;, but goes further. In the introduction, where he examines the metaphysics of rebellion, he concludes with the phrase &quot;I revolt, therefore we exist&quot; implying the recognition of a common human condition. Camus also delineates the difference between revolution and rebellion and notices that history has shown that the rebel&#x27;s revolution might easily end up as an oppressive regime; he therefore places importance on the morals accompanying the revolution. Camus poses a crucial question: Is it possible for humans to act in an ethical and meaningful manner in a silent universe? According to him, the answer is yes, as the experience and awareness of the Absurd creates the moral values and also sets the limits of our actions. Camus separates the modern form of rebellion into two modes. First, there is the metaphysical rebellion, which is &quot;the movement by which man protests against his condition and against the whole of creation&quot;. The other mode, historical rebellion, is the attempt to materialize the abstract spirit of metaphysical rebellion and change the world. In this attempt, the rebel must balance between the evil of the world and the intrinsic evil which every revolt carries, and not cause any unjustifiable suffering.

==Legacy==

Camus&#x27;s novels and philosophical essays are still influential. After his death, interest in Camus followed the rise – and diminution – of the New Left. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, interest in his alternative road to communism resurfaced. He is remembered for his skeptical humanism and his support for political tolerance, dialogue, and civil rights.

Although Camus has been linked to anti-Soviet communism, reaching as far as anarcho-syndicalism, some neoliberals have tried to associate him with their policies; for instance, the French President Nicolas Sarkozy suggested that his remains be moved to the Panthéon, an idea that was criticised by Camus&#x27;s surviving family and angered many on the Left.

American heavy metal band Avenged Sevenfold stated that their album &quot;Life Is But a Dream...&quot; was inspired by the work of Camus.

Albert Camus also served as the inspiration for the Aquarius Gold Saint Camus in the classic anime and manga Saint Seiya.

==Tributes==
In Tipasa, Algeria, inside the Roman ruins, facing the sea and Mount Chenoua, a stele was erected in 1961 in honor of Albert Camus with this phrase in French extracted from his work : &quot;I understand here what is called glory: the right to love beyond measure&quot; ().

The French Post published a stamp with his likeness on 26 June 1967.

<text>Dame Agatha Mary Clarissa Christie, Lady Mallowan, (; 15 September 1890 – 12 January 1976) was an English author known for her 66 detective novels and 14 short story collections, particularly those revolving around fictional detectives Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple. She also wrote the world&#x27;s longest-running play, the murder mystery &quot;The Mousetrap&quot;, which has been performed in the West End of London since 1952. A writer during the &quot;Golden Age of Detective Fiction&quot;, Christie has been called the &quot;Queen of Crime&quot;—a nickname now trademarked by her estate—or the &quot;Queen of Mystery&quot;. She also wrote six novels under the pseudonym Mary Westmacott. In 1971, she was made a Dame (DBE) by Queen Elizabeth II for her contributions to literature. She is the best-selling fiction writer of all time, her novels having sold more than two billion copies.

Christie was born into a wealthy upper-middle-class family in Torquay, Devon, and was largely home-schooled. She was initially an unsuccessful writer with six consecutive rejections, but this changed in 1920 when &quot;The Mysterious Affair at Styles&quot;, featuring detective Hercule Poirot, was published. Her first husband was Archibald Christie; they married in 1914 and had one child before divorcing in 1928. Following the breakdown of her marriage and the death of her mother in 1926, she made international headlines by going missing for eleven days. During both World Wars, she served in hospital dispensaries, acquiring a thorough knowledge of the poisons that featured in many of her novels, short stories, and plays. Following her marriage to archaeologist Max Mallowan in 1930, she spent several months each year on digs in the Middle East and used her first-hand knowledge of this profession in her fiction.

According to UNESCO&#x27;s Index Translationum, she remains the most-translated individual author. Her novel &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; is one of the top-selling books of all time, with approximately 100 million copies sold. Christie&#x27;s stage play &quot;The Mousetrap&quot; holds the world record for the longest initial run. It opened at the Ambassadors Theatre in the West End on 25 November 1952, and by 2018 there had been more than 27,500 performances. The play was temporarily closed in 2020 because of COVID-19 lockdowns in London before it reopened in 2021.

In 1955, Christie was the first recipient of the Mystery Writers of America&#x27;s Grand Master Award. Later that year, &quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot; received an Edgar Award for best play. In 2013, she was voted the best crime writer and &quot;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&quot; the best crime novel ever by 600 professional novelists of the Crime Writers&#x27; Association. In 2015, &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; was named the &quot;World&#x27;s Favourite Christie&quot; in a vote sponsored by the author&#x27;s estate. Many of Christie&#x27;s books and short stories have been adapted for television, radio, video games, and graphic novels. More than 30 feature films are based on her work.

== Life and career ==
=== 1890–1907: childhood and adolescence ===
Agatha Mary Clarissa Miller was born on 15 September 1890, into a wealthy upper middle class family in Torquay, Devon. She was the youngest of three children born to Frederick Alvah Miller, &quot;a gentleman of substance&quot;, and his wife Clarissa &quot;Clara&quot; Margaret (née Boehmer).

Christie&#x27;s mother Clara was born in Dublin in 1854 to British Army officer Frederick Boehmer and his wife Mary Ann (née West). Boehmer died in Jersey in 1863, leaving his widow to raise Clara and her brothers on a meagre income. Two weeks after Boehmer&#x27;s death, Mary&#x27;s sister, Margaret West, married widowed dry goods merchant Nathaniel Frary Miller, a US citizen. To assist Mary financially, Margaret and Nathaniel agreed to foster nine-year-old Clara; the family settled in Timperley, Cheshire. The couple had no children together, but Nathaniel had a 17-year-old son, Frederick &quot;Fred&quot;, from his previous marriage. Fred was born in New York City and travelled extensively after leaving his Swiss boarding school. He and Clara were married in London in 1878. Their first child, Margaret &quot;Madge&quot; Frary, was born in Torquay in 1879. The second, Louis Montant &quot;Monty&quot;, was born in Morristown, New Jersey, in 1880, while the family was on an extended visit to the United States.

When Fred&#x27;s father died in 1869, he left Clara £2,000 (approximately ); in 1881 they used this to buy the leasehold of a villa in Torquay named Ashfield. It was here that their third and last child, Agatha, was born in 1890. She described her childhood as &quot;very happy&quot;. The Millers lived mainly in Devon but often visited her step-grandmother/great-aunt Margaret Miller in Ealing and maternal grandmother Mary Boehmer in Bayswater. A year was spent abroad with her family, in the French Pyrenees, Paris, Dinard, and Guernsey. Because her siblings were so much older, and there were few children in their neighbourhood, Christie spent much of her time playing alone with her pets and imaginary companions. She eventually made friends with other girls in Torquay, noting that &quot;one of the highlights of my existence&quot; was her appearance with them in a youth production of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot;, in which she played the hero, Colonel Fairfax.

According to Christie, Clara believed she should not learn to read until she was eight; thanks to her curiosity, she was reading by the age of four. Her sister had been sent to a boarding school, but their mother insisted that Christie receive her education at home. As a result, her parents and sister supervised her studies in reading, writing and basic arithmetic, a subject she particularly enjoyed. They also taught her music, and she learned to play the piano and the mandolin.

Christie was a voracious reader from an early age. Some of her earliest memories were of reading children&#x27;s books by Mrs Molesworth and Edith Nesbit. When a little older, she moved on to the surreal verse of Edward Lear and Lewis Carroll. As an adolescent, she enjoyed works by Anthony Hope, Walter Scott, Charles Dickens, and Alexandre Dumas. In April 1901, aged 10, she wrote her first poem, &quot;The Cow Slip&quot;.

By 1901, her father&#x27;s health had deteriorated, because of what he believed were heart problems. Fred died in November 1901 from pneumonia and chronic kidney disease. Christie later said that her father&#x27;s death when she was 11 marked the end of her childhood.

The family&#x27;s financial situation had, by this time, worsened. Madge married the year after their father&#x27;s death and moved to Cheadle, Cheshire; Monty was overseas, serving in a British regiment. Christie now lived alone at Ashfield with her mother. In 1902, she began attending Miss Guyer&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School in Torquay but found it difficult to adjust to the disciplined atmosphere. In 1905, her mother sent her to Paris, where she was educated in a series of (boarding schools), focusing on voice training and piano playing. Deciding she lacked the temperament and talent, she gave up her goal of performing professionally as a concert pianist or an opera singer.

=== 1907–1926: early literary attempts, marriage, literary success ===

After completing her education, Christie returned to England to find her mother ailing. They decided to spend the winter of 1907–1908 in the warm climate of Egypt, which was then a regular tourist destination for wealthy Britons. They stayed for three months at the Gezirah Palace Hotel in Cairo. Christie attended many dances and other social functions; she particularly enjoyed watching amateur polo matches. While they visited some ancient Egyptian monuments such as the Great Pyramid of Giza, she did not exhibit the great interest in archaeology and Egyptology that developed in her later years. Returning to Britain, she continued her social activities, writing and performing in amateur theatrics. She also helped put on a play called &quot;The Blue Beard of Unhappiness&quot; with female friends.

At 18, Christie wrote her first short story, &quot;The House of Beauty&quot;, while recovering in bed from an illness. It consisted of about 6,000 words about &quot;madness and dreams&quot;, subjects of fascination for her. Her biographer Janet Morgan has commented that, despite &quot;infelicities of style&quot;, the story was &quot;compelling&quot;. (The story became an early version of her story &quot;The House of Dreams&quot;.) Other stories followed, most of them illustrating her interest in spiritualism and the paranormal. These included &quot;The Call of Wings&quot; and &quot;The Little Lonely God&quot;. Magazines rejected all her early submissions, made under pseudonyms (including Mac Miller, Nathaniel Miller, and Sydney West); some submissions were later revised and published under her real name, often with new titles.
Around the same time, Christie began work on her first novel, &quot;Snow Upon the Desert&quot;. Writing under the pseudonym Monosyllaba, she set the book in Cairo and drew upon her recent experiences there. She was disappointed when the six publishers she contacted declined the work. Clara suggested that her daughter ask for advice from the successful novelist Eden Phillpotts, a family friend and neighbour, who responded to her enquiry, encouraged her writing, and sent her an introduction to his own literary agent, Hughes Massie, who also rejected &quot;Snow Upon the Desert&quot; but suggested a second novel.

Meanwhile, Christie&#x27;s social activities expanded, with country house parties, riding, hunting, dances, and roller skating. She had short-lived relationships with four men and an engagement to another. In October 1912, she was introduced to Archibald &quot;Archie&quot; Christie at a dance given by Lord and Lady Clifford at Ugbrooke, about from Torquay. The son of a barrister in the Indian Civil Service, Archie was a Royal Artillery officer who was seconded to the Royal Flying Corps in April 1913. The couple quickly fell in love. Three months after their first meeting, Archie proposed marriage, and Agatha accepted.

With the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Archie was sent to France to fight. They married on Christmas Eve 1914 at Emmanuel Church, Clifton, Bristol, close to the home of his mother and stepfather, when Archie was on home leave. Rising through the ranks, he was posted back to Britain in September 1918 as a colonel in the Air Ministry. Christie involved herself in the war effort as a member of the Voluntary Aid Detachment of the British Red Cross. From October 1914 to May 1915, then from June 1916 to September 1918, she worked 3,400 hours in the Town Hall Red Cross Hospital, Torquay, first as a Voluntary Aid Detachment nurse (unpaid) then as a dispenser at £16 (approximately ) a year from 1917 after qualifying as an apothecary&#x27;s assistant. Her war service ended in September 1918 when Archie was reassigned to London, and they rented a flat in St. John&#x27;s Wood.

Christie had long been a fan of detective novels, having enjoyed Wilkie Collins&#x27;s &quot;The Woman in White&quot; and &quot;The Moonstone&quot;, and Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s early Sherlock Holmes stories. She wrote her first detective novel, &quot;The Mysterious Affair at Styles&quot;, in 1916. It featured Hercule Poirot, a former Belgian police officer with &quot;magnificent moustaches&quot; and a head &quot;exactly the shape of an egg&quot;, who had taken refuge in Britain after Germany invaded Belgium. Christie&#x27;s inspiration for the character came from Belgian refugees living in Torquay, and the Belgian soldiers she helped to treat as a volunteer nurse during the First World War. Her original manuscript was rejected by Hodder &amp; Stoughton and Methuen. After keeping the submission for several months, John Lane at The Bodley Head offered to accept it, provided that Christie change how the solution was revealed. She did so, and signed a contract committing her next five books to The Bodley Head, which she later felt was exploitative. It was published in 1920.
Christie settled into married life, giving birth to her only child, Rosalind Margaret Clarissa (later Hicks), in August 1919 at Ashfield. Archie left the Air Force at the end of the war and began working in the City financial sector on a relatively low salary. They still employed a maid. Her second novel, &quot;The Secret Adversary&quot; (1922), featuring new detective couple Tommy and Tuppence, was also published by The Bodley Head. It earned her £50 (approximately ). A third novel, &quot;Murder on the Links&quot;, again featured Poirot, as did the short stories commissioned by Bruce Ingram, editor of &quot;The Sketch&quot; magazine, from 1923. She now had no difficulty selling her work.

In 1922, the Christies joined an around-the-world promotional tour for the British Empire Exhibition, led by Major Ernest Belcher. Leaving their daughter with Agatha&#x27;s mother and sister, in 10 months they travelled to South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, and Canada. They learned to surf prone in South Africa; then, in Waikiki, they were among the first Britons to surf standing up, and extended their time there by three months to practise. She is remembered at the Museum of British Surfing as having said about surfing, &quot;Oh it was heaven! Nothing like rushing through the water at what seems to you a speed of about two hundred miles an hour. It is one of the most perfect physical pleasures I have known.&quot;

When they returned to England, Archie resumed work in the city, and Christie continued to work hard at her writing. After living in a series of apartments in London, they bought a house in Sunningdale, Berkshire, which they renamed Styles after the mansion in Christie&#x27;s first detective novel.

Christie&#x27;s mother, Clarissa Miller, died in April 1926. They had been close, and the loss sent Christie into a deep depression. In August 1926, reports appeared in the press that Christie had gone to a village near Biarritz to recuperate from a &quot;breakdown&quot; caused by &quot;overwork&quot;.

=== 1926: disappearance ===

In August 1926, Archie asked Christie for a divorce. He had fallen in love with Nancy Neele, a friend of Major Belcher. On 3December 1926, the pair quarrelled after Archie announced his plan to spend the weekend with friends, unaccompanied by his wife. Late that evening, Christie disappeared from their home in Sunningdale. The following morning, her car, a Morris Cowley, was discovered at Newlands Corner in Surrey, parked above a chalk quarry with an expired driving licence and clothes inside. It was feared that she might have drowned herself in the Silent Pool, a nearby beauty spot.

The disappearance quickly became a news story. The press sought to satisfy their readers&#x27; &quot;hunger for sensation, disaster, and scandal&quot;. Home Secretary William Joynson-Hicks pressured police, and a newspaper offered a £100 reward (). More than 1,000 police officers, 15,000 volunteers, and several aeroplanes searched the rural landscape. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle gave a spirit medium one of Christie&#x27;s gloves to find her. Christie&#x27;s disappearance made international headlines, including featuring on the front page of &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Despite the extensive manhunt, she was not found for another 10 days. On 4 December, the day after she went missing, it is now known she had tea in London and visited Harrods department store where she marvelled at the spectacle of the store&#x27;s Christmas display. On 14 December 1926, she was located at the Swan Hydropathic Hotel in Harrogate, Yorkshire, north of her home in Sunningdale, registered as &quot;Mrs Tressa Neele&quot; (the surname of her husband&#x27;s lover) from &quot; S.A.&quot; (South Africa). The next day, Christie left for her sister&#x27;s residence at Abney Hall, Cheadle, where she was sequestered &quot;in guarded hall, gates locked, telephone cut off, and callers turned away&quot;.

Christie&#x27;s autobiography makes no reference to the disappearance. Two doctors diagnosed her with &quot;an unquestionable genuine loss of memory&quot;, yet opinion remains divided over the reason for her disappearance. Some, including her biographer Morgan, believe she disappeared during a fugue state. The author Jared Cade concluded that Christie planned the event to embarrass her husband but did not anticipate the resulting public melodrama. Christie&#x27;s biographer Laura Thompson provides an alternative view that Christie disappeared during a nervous breakdown, conscious of her actions but not in emotional control of herself. Public reaction at the time was largely negative, supposing a publicity stunt or an attempt to frame her husband for murder.

=== 1927–1976: second marriage and later life ===

In January 1927, Christie, looking &quot;very pale&quot;, sailed with her daughter and secretary to Las Palmas, Canary Islands, to &quot;complete her convalescence&quot;, returning three months later. Christie petitioned for divorce and was granted a decree nisi against her husband in April 1928, which was made absolute in October 1928. Archie married Nancy Neele a week later. Christie retained custody of their daughter, Rosalind, and kept the Christie surname for her writing. Reflecting on the period in her autobiography, Christie wrote, &quot;So, after illness, came sorrow, despair and heartbreak. There is no need to dwell on it.&quot;

In 1928, Christie left England and took the (Simplon) Orient Express to Istanbul and then to Baghdad. In Iraq, she became friends with archaeologist Leonard Woolley and his wife, who invited her to return to their dig in February 1930. On that second trip, she met archaeologist Max Mallowan, 13 years her junior. In a 1977 interview, Mallowan recounted his first meeting with Christie, when he took her and a group of tourists on a tour of his expedition site in Iraq. Christie and Mallowan married in Edinburgh in September 1930. Their marriage lasted until Christie&#x27;s death in 1976. She accompanied Mallowan on his archaeological expeditions, and her travels with him contributed background to several of her novels set in the Middle East. Other novels (such as &quot;Peril at End House&quot;) were set in and around Torquay, where she was raised. Christie drew on her experience of international train travel when writing her 1934 novel &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot;. The Pera Palace Hotel in Istanbul, the eastern terminus of the railway, claims the book was written there and maintains Christie&#x27;s room as a memorial to the author.
Christie and Mallowan first lived in Cresswell Place in Chelsea, and later in Sheffield Terrace, Holland Park, Kensington. Both properties are now marked by blue plaques. In 1934, they bought Winterbrook House in Winterbrook, a hamlet near Wallingford. This was their main residence for the rest of their lives and the place where Christie did much of her writing. This house also bears a blue plaque. Christie led a quiet life despite being known in Wallingford; from 1951 to 1976 she served as president of the local amateur dramatic society.

The couple acquired the Greenway Estate in Devon as a summer residence in 1938; it was given to the National Trust in 2000. Christie frequently stayed at Abney Hall, Cheshire, which was owned by her brother-in-law, James Watts, and based at least two stories there: a short story, &quot;The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding&quot;, in the story collection of the same name and the novel &quot;After the Funeral&quot;. One Christie compendium notes that &quot;Abney became Agatha&#x27;s greatest inspiration for country-house life, with all its servants and grandeur being woven into her plots. The descriptions of the fictional Chimneys, Stonygates, and other houses in her stories are mostly Abney Hall in various forms.&quot;


During World War II, Christie moved to London and lived in a flat at the Isokon in Hampstead, while working in the pharmacy at University College Hospital (UCH), London, where she updated her knowledge of poisons. Her later novel &quot;The Pale Horse&quot; was based on a suggestion from Harold Davis, the chief pharmacist at UCH. In 1977, a thallium poisoning case was solved by British medical personnel who had read Christie&#x27;s book and recognised the symptoms she described.

The British intelligence agency MI5 investigated Christie after a character called Major Bletchley appeared in her 1941 thriller &quot;N or M?&quot;, which was about a hunt for a pair of deadly fifth columnists in wartime England. MI5 was concerned that Christie had a spy in Britain&#x27;s top-secret codebreaking centre, Bletchley Park. The agency&#x27;s fears were allayed when Christie told her friend, the codebreaker Dilly Knox, &quot;I was stuck there on my way by train from Oxford to London and took revenge by giving the name to one of my least lovable characters.&quot;

Christie was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1950. In honour of her many literary works, Christie was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1956 New Year Honours. She was co-president of the Detection Club from 1958 to her death in 1976. In 1961, she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Literature degree by the University of Exeter. In the 1971 New Year Honours, she was promoted to Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE), three years after her husband had been knighted for his archaeological work. After her husband&#x27;s knighthood, Christie could also be styled Lady Mallowan.

From 1971 to 1974, Christie&#x27;s health began to fail, but she continued to write. Her last novel was &quot;Postern of Fate&quot; in 1973. Textual analysis suggested that Christie may have begun to develop Alzheimer&#x27;s disease or other dementia at about this time.

=== Personal qualities ===

In 1946, Christie said of herself: &quot;My chief dislikes are crowds, loud noises, gramophones and cinemas. I dislike the taste of alcohol and do not like smoking. I &quot;do&quot; like sun, sea, flowers, travelling, strange foods, sports, concerts, theatres, pianos, and doing embroidery.&quot;

Christie was a lifelong, &quot;quietly devout&quot; member of the Church of England, attended church regularly, and kept her mother&#x27;s copy of &quot;The Imitation of Christ&quot; by her bedside. After her divorce, she stopped taking the sacrament of communion.

The Agatha Christie Trust For Children was established in 1969, and shortly after Christie&#x27;s death a charitable memorial fund was set up to &quot;help two causes that she favoured: old people and young children&quot;.

Christie&#x27;s obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; notes that &quot;she never cared much for the cinema, or for wireless and television.&quot; Further,
== Death and estate ==
=== Death and burial ===
Christie died on 12 January 1976 at age 85 from natural causes at her home at Winterbrook House. Upon her death, two West End theatresthe St. Martin&#x27;s, where &quot;The Mousetrap&quot; was playing, and the Savoy, which was home to a revival of &quot;Murder at the Vicarage&quot;dimmed their outside lights in her honour. She was buried in the nearby churchyard of St Mary&#x27;s, Cholsey, in a plot she had chosen with her husband 10 years previously. The simple funeral service was attended by about 20 newspaper and TV reporters, some having travelled from as far away as South America. Thirty wreaths adorned Christie&#x27;s grave, including one from the cast of her long-running play &quot;The Mousetrap&quot; and one sent &quot;on behalf of the multitude of grateful readers&quot; by the Ulverscroft Large Print Book Publishers.

Mallowan, who remarried in 1977, died in 1978 and was buried next to Christie.

=== Estate and subsequent ownership of works ===

Christie was unhappy about becoming &quot;an employed wage slave&quot;, and for tax reasons set up a private company in 1955, Agatha Christie Limited, to hold the rights to her works. In about 1959 she transferred her 278-acre home, Greenway Estate, to her daughter, Rosalind Hicks. In 1968, when Christie was almost 80, she sold a 51% stake in Agatha Christie Limited (and the works it owned) to Booker Books (better known as Booker Author&#x27;s Division), which by 1977 had increased its stake to 64%. Agatha Christie Limited still owns the worldwide rights for more than 80 of Christie&#x27;s novels and short stories, 19 plays, and nearly 40 TV films.

In the late 1950s, Christie had reputedly been earning around £100,000 (approximately ) per year. Christie sold an estimated 300 million books during her lifetime. At the time of her death in 1976, &quot;she was the best-selling novelist in history.&quot;
One estimate of her total earnings from more than a half-century of writing is $20 million (approximately $ million in ). As a result of her tax planning, her will left only £106,683 (approximately ) net, which went mostly to her husband and daughter along with some smaller bequests. Her remaining 36% share of Agatha Christie Limited was inherited by Hicks, who passionately preserved her mother&#x27;s works, image, and legacy until her own death 28 years later. The family&#x27;s share of the company allowed them to appoint 50% of the board and the chairman, and retain a veto over new treatments, updated versions, and republications of her works.

In 2004, Hicks&#x27; obituary in &quot;The Telegraph&quot; noted that she had been &quot;determined to remain true to her mother&#x27;s vision and to protect the integrity of her creations&quot; and disapproved of &quot;merchandising&quot; activities. Upon her death on 28 October 2004, the Greenway Estate passed to her son Mathew Prichard. After his stepfather&#x27;s death in 2005, Prichard donated Greenway and its contents to the National Trust.

Christie&#x27;s family and family trusts, including great-grandson James Prichard, continue to own the 36% stake in Agatha Christie Limited, and remain associated with the company. In 2020, James Prichard was the company&#x27;s chairman. Mathew Prichard also holds the copyright to some of his grandmother&#x27;s later works including &quot;The Mousetrap&quot;. Christie&#x27;s work continues to be developed in a range of adaptations.

In 1998, Booker sold its shares in Agatha Christie Limited (at the time earning £2,100,000, approximately annual revenue) for £10,000,000 (approximately ) to Chorion, whose portfolio of authors&#x27; works included the literary estates of Enid Blyton and Dennis Wheatley. In February 2012, after a management buyout, Chorion began to sell off its literary assets. This included the sale of Chorion&#x27;s 64% stake in Agatha Christie Limited to Acorn Media UK. In 2014, RLJ Entertainment Inc. (RLJE) acquired Acorn Media UK, renamed it Acorn Media Enterprises, and incorporated it as the RLJE UK development arm.

In late February 2014, media reports stated that the BBC had acquired exclusive TV rights to Christie&#x27;s works in the UK (previously associated with ITV) and made plans with Acorn&#x27;s co-operation to air new productions for the 125th anniversary of Christie&#x27;s birth in 2015. As part of that deal, the BBC broadcast &quot;Partners in Crime&quot; and &quot;And Then There Were None&quot;, both in 2015. Subsequent productions have included &quot;The Witness for the Prosecution&quot; but plans to televise &quot;Ordeal by Innocence&quot; at Christmas 2017 were delayed because of controversy surrounding one of the cast members. The three-part adaptation aired in April 2018. A three-part adaptation of &quot;The A.B.C. Murders&quot; starring John Malkovich and Rupert Grint began filming in June 2018 and was first broadcast in December 2018. A two-part adaptation of &quot;The Pale Horse&quot; was broadcast on BBC1 in February 2020. &quot;Death Comes as the End&quot; will be the next BBC adaptation.

Since 2020, reissues of Christie&#x27;s Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot novels by HarperCollins have removed &quot;passages containing descriptions, insults or references to ethnicity&quot;.

=== Works of fiction ===
==== Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple ====

Christie&#x27;s first published book, &quot;The Mysterious Affair at Styles&quot;, was released in 1920 and introduced the detective Hercule Poirot, who appeared in 33 of her novels and more than 50 short stories.

Over the years, Christie grew tired of Poirot, much as Doyle did with Sherlock Holmes. By the end of the 1930s, Christie wrote in her diary that she was finding Poirot &quot;insufferable&quot;, and by the 1960s she felt he was &quot;an egocentric creep&quot;. Thompson believes Christie&#x27;s occasional antipathy to her creation is overstated, and points out that &quot;in later life she sought to protect him against misrepresentation as powerfully as if he were her own flesh and blood&quot;. Unlike Doyle, she resisted the temptation to kill her detective off while he was still popular. She married off Poirot&#x27;s &quot;Watson&quot;, Captain Arthur Hastings, in an attempt to trim her cast commitments.

Miss Jane Marple was introduced in a series of short stories that began publication in December 1927 and were subsequently collected under the title &quot;The Thirteen Problems&quot;. Marple was a genteel, elderly spinster who solved crimes using analogies to English village life. Christie said, &quot;Miss Marple was not in any way a picture of my grandmother; she was far more fussy and spinsterish than my grandmother ever was&quot;, but her autobiography establishes a firm connection between the fictional character and Christie&#x27;s step-grandmother Margaret Miller (&quot;Auntie-Grannie&quot;) and her &quot;Ealing cronies&quot;. Both Marple and Miller &quot;always expected the worst of everyone and everything, and were, with almost frightening accuracy, usually proved right&quot;. Marple appeared in 12 novels and 20 stories.

During the Second World War, Christie wrote two novels, &quot;Curtain&quot; and &quot;Sleeping Murder&quot;, featuring Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple, respectively. Both books were sealed in a bank vault, and she made over the copyrights by deed of gift to her daughter and her husband to provide each with a kind of insurance policy. Christie had a heart attack and a serious fall in 1974, after which she was unable to write. Her daughter authorised the publication of &quot;Curtain&quot; in 1975, and &quot;Sleeping Murder&quot; was published posthumously in 1976. These publications followed the success of the 1974 film version of &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot;.

Shortly before the publication of &quot;Curtain&quot;, Poirot became the first fictional character to have an obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which was printed on page one on 6 August 1975.

Christie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both Poirot and Miss Marple. In a recording discovered and released in 2008, Christie revealed the reason for this: &quot;Hercule Poirot, a complete egoist, would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady. Hercule Poirota professional sleuthwould not be at home at all in Miss Marple&#x27;s world.&quot;

In 2013, the Christie family supported the release of a new Poirot story, &quot;The Monogram Murders&quot;, written by British author Sophie Hannah. Hannah later published three more Poirot mysteries, &quot;Closed Casket&quot; in 2016, &quot;The Mystery of Three Quarters&quot; in 2018. &quot;The Killings at Kingfisher Hill&quot; in 2020, &quot;Hercule Poirot&#x27;s Silent Night&quot; in 2023 with a sixth instalment being commissioned in 2024.

In 2021, following the success of Sophie Hannah&#x27;s outings with Poirot, the Christie family support the release of a collection of Miss Marple short stories. Called &quot;Marple&quot;, the collection was released in 2022 and each story was written by a different author. This included Naomi Alderman, Leigh Bardugo, Alyssa Cole, Lucy Foley, Elly Griffiths, Natalie Haynes, Jean Kwok, Val McDermid, Karen M. McManus, Dreda Say Mitchell, Kate Mosse and Ruth Ware.

==== Formula and plot devices ====

Christie has been called the &quot;Duchess of Death&quot;, the &quot;Mistress of Mystery&quot;, and the &quot;Queen of Crime&quot;. Early in her career, a reporter noted that &quot;her plots are possible, logical, and always new&quot;. According to Hannah, &quot;At the start of each novel, she shows us an apparently impossible situation and we go mad wondering &#x27;How can this be happening?&#x27;. Then, slowly, she reveals how the impossible is not only possible but the only thing that could have happened.&quot;
Christie developed her storytelling techniques during what has been called the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of detective fiction. Author Dilys Winn called Christie &quot;the doyenne of Coziness&quot;, a sub-genre which &quot;featured a small village setting, a hero with faintly aristocratic family connections, a plethora of red herrings and a tendency to commit homicide with sterling silver letter openers and poisons imported from Paraguay&quot;. At the end, in a Christie hallmark, the detective usually gathers the surviving suspects into one room, explains the course of their deductive reasoning, and reveals the guilty party; but there are exceptions where it is left to the guilty party to explain all (such as &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; and &quot;Endless Night&quot;).

Christie did not limit herself to quaint English villagesthe action might take place on a small island (&quot;And Then There Were None&quot;), an aeroplane (&quot;Death in the Clouds&quot;), a train (&quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot;), a steamship (&quot;Death on the Nile&quot;), a smart London flat (&quot;Cards on the Table&quot;), a resort in the West Indies (&quot;A Caribbean Mystery&quot;), or an archaeological dig (&quot;Murder in Mesopotamia&quot;)but the circle of potential suspects is usually closed and intimate: family members, friends, servants, business associates, fellow travellers. Stereotyped characters abound (the , the stolid policeman, the devoted servant, the dull colonel), but these may be subverted to stymie the reader; impersonations and secret alliances are always possible. There is always a motivemost often, money: &quot;There are very few killers in Christie who enjoy murder for its own sake.&quot;

Professor of Pharmacology Michael C. Gerald noted that &quot;in over half her novels, one or more victims are poisoned, albeit not always to the full satisfaction of the perpetrator.&quot; Guns, knives, garrottes, tripwires, blunt instruments, and even a hatchet were also used, but &quot;Christie never resorted to elaborate mechanical or scientific means to explain her ingenuity,&quot; according to John Curran, author and literary adviser to the Christie estate. Many of her clues are mundane objects: a calendar, a coffee cup, wax flowers, a beer bottle, a fireplace used during a heat wave.

According to crime writer P. D. James, Christie was prone to making the unlikeliest character the guilty party. Alert readers could sometimes identify the culprit by identifying the least likely suspect. Christie mocked this insight in her foreword to &quot;Cards on the Table&quot;: &quot;Spot the person least likely to have committed the crime and in nine times out of ten your task is finished. Since I do not want my faithful readers to fling away this book in disgust, I prefer to warn them beforehand &quot;that this is not that kind of book&quot;.&quot;

On BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; in 2007, Brian Aldiss said Christie had told him she wrote her books up to the last chapter, then decided who the most unlikely suspect was, after which she would go back and make the necessary changes to &quot;frame&quot; that person. Based upon a study of her working notebooks, Curran describes how Christie would first create a cast of characters, choose a setting, and then produce a list of scenes in which specific clues would be revealed; the order of scenes would be revised as she developed her plot. Of necessity, the murderer had to be known to the author before the sequence could be finalised and she began to type or dictate the first draft of her novel. Much of the work, particularly dialogue, was done in her head before she put it on paper.

In 2013, the 600 members of the Crime Writers&#x27; Association chose &quot;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&quot; as &quot;the best whodunit... ever written&quot;. Author Julian Symons observed, &quot;In an obvious sense, the book fits within the conventions... The setting is a village deep within the English countryside, Roger Ackroyd dies in his study; there is a butler who behaves suspiciously... Every successful detective story in this period involved a deceit practised upon the reader, and here the trick is the highly original one of making the murderer the local doctor, who tells the story and acts as Poirot&#x27;s Watson.&quot; Critic Sutherland Scott stated, &quot;If Agatha Christie had made no other contribution to the literature of detective fiction she would still deserve our grateful thanks&quot; for writing this novel.

In September 2015, to mark her 125th birthday, &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; was named the &quot;World&#x27;s Favourite Christie&quot; in a vote sponsored by the author&#x27;s estate. The novel is emblematic of both her use of formula and her willingness to discard it. &quot;&quot;And Then There Were None&quot; carries the &#x27;closed society&#x27; type of murder mystery to extreme lengths,&quot; according to author Charles Osborne. It begins with the classic set-up of potential victim(s) and killer(s) isolated from the outside world, but then violates conventions. There is no detective involved in the action, no interviews of suspects, no careful search for clues, and no suspects gathered together in the last chapter to be confronted with the solution. As Christie herself said, &quot;Ten people had to die without it becoming ridiculous or the murderer being obvious.&quot; Critics agreed she had succeeded: &quot;The arrogant Mrs. Christie this time set herself a fearsome test of her own ingenuity... the reviews, not surprisingly, were without exception wildly adulatory.&quot;

==== Character stereotypes and racism ====
Christie included stereotyped descriptions of characters in her work, especially before 1945 (when such attitudes were more commonly expressed publicly), particularly in regard to Italians, Jews, and non-Europeans. For example, she described &quot;men of Hebraic extraction, sallow men with hooked noses, wearing rather flamboyant jewellery&quot; in the short story &quot;The Soul of the Croupier&quot; from the collection &quot;The Mysterious Mr Quin&quot;. In 1947, the Anti-Defamation League in the US sent an official letter of complaint to Christie&#x27;s American publishers, Dodd, Mead and Company, regarding perceived antisemitism in her works. Christie&#x27;s British literary agent later wrote to her US representative, authorising American publishers to &quot;omit the word &#x27;Jew&#x27; when it refers to an unpleasant character in future books.&quot;

In &quot;The Hollow&quot;, published in 1946, one of the characters is described by another as &quot;a Whitechapel Jewess with dyed hair and a voice like a corncrake ... a small woman with a thick nose, henna red hair and a disagreeable voice&quot;. To contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions, Christie portrayed some &quot;foreign&quot; characters as victims, or potential victims, at the hands of English malefactors, such as, respectively, Olga Seminoff (&quot;Hallowe&#x27;en Party&quot;) and Katrina Reiger (in the short story &quot;How Does Your Garden Grow?&quot;). Jewish characters are often seen as un-English (such as Oliver Manders in &quot;Three Act Tragedy&quot;), but they are rarely the culprits.

In 2023, the &quot;Telegraph&quot; reported that several Agatha Christie novels have been edited to remove &quot;passages containing descriptions, insults or references to ethnicity&quot;. Poirot and Miss Marple mysteries written between 1920 and 1976 have had passages reworked or removed in new editions published by HarperCollins, in order to strip them of language and descriptions that modern audiences find offensive, especially those involving the characters Christie&#x27;s protagonists encounter outside the UK. Sensitivity readers had made the edits, which were evident in digital versions of the new editions, including the entire Miss Marple run and selected Poirot novels set to be released or that have been released since 2020.

==== Other detectives ====
In addition to Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple, Christie also created amateur detectives Thomas (Tommy) Beresford and his wife, Prudence &quot;Tuppence&quot; &quot;née&quot; Cowley, who appear in four novels and one collection of short stories published between 1922 and 1974. Unlike her other sleuths, the Beresfords were only in their early twenties when introduced in &quot;The Secret Adversary&quot;, and were allowed to age alongside their creator. She treated their stories with a lighter touch, giving them a &quot;dash and verve&quot; which was not universally admired by critics. Their last adventure, &quot;Postern of Fate&quot;, was Christie&#x27;s last novel.

Harley Quin was &quot;easily the most unorthodox&quot; of Christie&#x27;s fictional detectives. Inspired by Christie&#x27;s affection for the figures from the Harlequinade, the semi-supernatural Quin always works with an elderly, conventional man called Satterthwaite. The pair appear in 14 short stories, 12 of which were collected in 1930 as &quot;The Mysterious Mr. Quin&quot;. Mallowan described these tales as &quot;detection in a fanciful vein, touching on the fairy story, a natural product of Agatha&#x27;s peculiar imagination&quot;. Satterthwaite also appears in a novel, &quot;Three Act Tragedy&quot;, and a short story, &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Mirror&quot;, both of which feature Poirot.

Another of her lesser-known characters is Parker Pyne, a retired civil servant who assists unhappy people in an unconventional manner. The 12 short stories which introduced him, &quot;Parker Pyne Investigates&quot; (1934), are best remembered for &quot;The Case of the Discontented Soldier&quot;, which features Ariadne Oliver, &quot;an amusing and satirical self-portrait of Agatha Christie&quot;. Over the ensuing decades, Oliver reappeared in seven novels. In most of them she assists Poirot.

==== Plays ====
In 1928, Michael Morton adapted &quot;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&quot; for the stage under the name of &quot;Alibi&quot;. The play enjoyed a respectable run, but Christie disliked the changes made to her work and, in future, preferred to write for the theatre herself. The first of her own stage works was &quot;Black Coffee&quot;, which received good reviews when it opened in the West End in late 1930. She followed this up with adaptations of her detective novels: &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; in 1943, &quot;Appointment with Death&quot; in 1945, and &quot;The Hollow&quot; in 1951.

In the 1950s, &quot;the theatre ... engaged much of Agatha&#x27;s attention.&quot; She next adapted her short radio play into &quot;The Mousetrap&quot;, which premiered in the West End in 1952, produced by Peter Saunders and starring Richard Attenborough as the original Detective Sergeant Trotter. Her expectations for the play were not high; she believed it would run no more than eight months. &quot;The Mousetrap&quot; has long since made theatrical history as the world&#x27;s longest-running play, staging its 27,500th performance in September 2018. The play temporarily closed in March 2020, when all UK theatres shut due to the coronavirus pandemic, before it re-opened on 17 May 2021.

In 1953, she followed this with &quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot;, whose Broadway production won the New York Drama Critics&#x27; Circle award for best foreign play of 1954 and earned Christie an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America. &quot;Spider&#x27;s Web&quot;, an original work written for actress Margaret Lockwood at her request, premiered in the West End in 1954 and was also a hit. Christie became the first female playwright to have three plays running simultaneously in London: &quot;The Mousetrap&quot;, &quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot; and &quot;Spider&#x27;s Web&quot;. She said, &quot;Plays are much easier to &quot;write&quot; than books, because you can &quot;see&quot; them in your mind&#x27;s eye, you are not hampered by all that description which clogs you so terribly in a book and stops you from getting on with what&#x27;s happening.&quot; In a letter to her daughter, Christie said being a playwright was &quot;a lot of fun!&quot;

==== As Mary Westmacott ====

Christie published six mainstream novels under the name Mary Westmacott, a pseudonym which gave her the freedom to explore &quot;her most private and precious imaginative garden&quot;. These books typically received better reviews than her detective and thriller fiction. Of the first, &quot;Giant&#x27;s Bread&quot; published in 1930, a reviewer for &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;...her book is far above the average of current fiction, in fact, comes well under the classification of a &#x27;good book&#x27;. And it is only a satisfying novel that can claim that appellation.&quot; It was publicized from the very beginning that &quot;Mary Westmacott&quot; was a pen name of a well-known author, although the identity behind the pen name was kept secret; the dust jacket of &quot;Giant&#x27;s Bread&quot; mentions that the author had previously written &quot;under her real name...half a dozen books that have each passed the thirty thousand mark in sales.&quot; (In fact, though this was technically true, it disguised Christie&#x27;s identity through understatement. By the publication of &quot;Giant&#x27;s Bread&quot;, Christie had published 10 novels and two short story collections, all of which had sold considerably more than 30,000 copies.) After Christie&#x27;s authorship of the first four Westmacott novels was revealed by a journalist in 1949, she wrote two more, the last in 1956.

The other Westmacott titles are: &quot;Unfinished Portrait&quot; (1934), &quot;Absent in the Spring&quot; (1944), &quot;The Rose and the Yew Tree&quot; (1948), &quot;A Daughter&#x27;s a Daughter&quot; (1952), and &quot;The Burden&quot; (1956).

=== Non-fiction works ===

Christie published a few non-fiction works. &quot;Come, Tell Me How You Live&quot;, about working on an archaeological dig, was drawn from her life with Mallowan. &quot;The Grand Tour: Around the World with the Queen of Mystery&quot; is a collection of correspondence from her 1922 Grand Tour of the British Empire, including South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. &quot;Agatha Christie: An Autobiography&quot; was published posthumously in 1977 and adjudged the Best Critical/Biographical Work at the 1978 Edgar Awards.

=== Titles ===

Many of Christie&#x27;s works from 1940 onward have titles drawn from literature, with the original context of the title typically printed as an epigraph.

The inspirations for some of Christie&#x27;s titles include:
* William Shakespeare&#x27;s works: &quot;Sad Cypress&quot;, &quot;By the Pricking of My Thumbs&quot;, &quot;There is a Tide...&quot;, &quot;Absent in the Spring&quot;, and &quot;The Mousetrap&quot;, for example. Osborne notes that &quot;Shakespeare is the writer most quoted in the works of Agatha Christie&quot;;
* The Bible: &quot;Evil Under the Sun&quot;, &quot;The Burden&quot;, and &quot;The Pale Horse&quot;;
* Other works of literature: &quot;The Mirror Crack&#x27;d from Side to Side&quot; (from Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;The Lady of Shalott&quot;), &quot;The Moving Finger&quot; (from Edward FitzGerald&#x27;s translation of the &quot;Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám&quot;), &quot;The Rose and the Yew Tree&quot; (from T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;Four Quartets&quot;), &quot;Postern of Fate&quot; (from James Elroy Flecker&#x27;s &quot;Gates of Damascus&quot;), &quot;Endless Night&quot; (from William Blake&#x27;s &quot;Auguries of Innocence&quot;), &quot;N or M?&quot; (from the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;), and &quot;Come, Tell Me How You Live&quot; (from Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;).

Christie biographer Gillian Gill said, &quot;Christie&#x27;s writing has the sparseness, the directness, the narrative pace, and the universal appeal of the fairy story, and it is perhaps as modern fairy stories for grown-up children that Christie&#x27;s novels succeed.&quot; Reflecting a juxtaposition of innocence and horror, numerous Christie titles were drawn from well-known children&#x27;s nursery rhymes: &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; (from &quot;Ten Little Niggers&quot;, a rhyme also published as &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot;, both of which were also used for the book&#x27;s title in some printings), &quot;One, Two, Buckle My Shoe&quot; (from &quot;One, Two, Buckle My Shoe&quot;), &quot;Five Little Pigs&quot; (from &quot;This Little Piggy&quot;), &quot;Crooked House&quot; (from &quot;There Was a Crooked Man&quot;), &quot;A Pocket Full of Rye&quot; (from &quot;Sing a Song of Sixpence&quot;), &quot;Hickory Dickory Dock&quot; (from &quot;Hickory Dickory Dock&quot;), and &quot;Three Blind Mice&quot; (from &quot;Three Blind Mice&quot;).

== Critical reception ==
Christie is regularly referred to as the &quot;Queen of Crime&quot;—which is now trademarked by the Christie estate—or &quot;Queen of Mystery&quot;, and is considered a master of suspense, plotting, and characterisation. In 1955, she became the first recipient of the Mystery Writers of America&#x27;s Grand Master Award. She was named &quot;Best Writer of the Century&quot; and the Hercule Poirot series of books was named &quot;Best Series of the Century&quot; at the 2000 Bouchercon World Mystery Convention. In 2013, she was voted &quot;best crime writer&quot; in a survey of 600 members of the Crime Writers&#x27; Association of professional novelists. However, the writer Raymond Chandler criticised the artificiality of her books, as did writer Julian Symons. The literary critic Edmund Wilson described her prose as banal and her characterisations as superficial.
In 2011, Christie was named by the digital crime drama TV channel Alibi as the second most financially successful crime writer of all time in the United Kingdom, after James Bond author Ian Fleming, with total earnings around £100 million. In 2012, Christie was among the people selected by the artist Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous work, the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; album cover, &quot;to celebrate the British cultural figures he most admires&quot;. On the record-breaking longevity of Christie&#x27;s &quot;The Mousetrap&quot; which had marked its 60th anniversary in 2012, Stephen Moss in &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote, &quot;the play and its author are the stars&quot;.

In 2015, marking the 125th anniversary of her birth date, 25 contemporary mystery writers and one publisher gave their views on Christie&#x27;s works. Many of the authors had read Christie&#x27;s novels first, before other mystery writers, in English or in their native language, influencing their own writing, and nearly all still viewed her as the &quot;Queen of Crime&quot; and creator of the plot twists used by mystery authors. Nearly all had one or more favourites among Christie&#x27;s mysteries and found her books still good to read nearly 100 years after her first novel was published. Just one of the 25 authors held with Wilson&#x27;s views.

=== Book sales ===

In her prime, Christie was rarely out of the bestseller list. She was the first crime writer to have 100,000 copies of 10 of her titles published by Penguin on the same day in 1948. , &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; listed Christie as the best-selling fiction writer of all time. , her novels had sold more than two billion copies in 44 languages. Half the sales are of English-language editions, and half are translations. According to Index Translationum, , she was the most-translated individual author.

Christie is one of the most-borrowed authors in UK libraries. She is also the UK&#x27;s best-selling spoken-book author. In 2002, 117,696 Christie audiobooks were sold, in comparison to 97,755 for J. K. Rowling, 78,770 for Roald Dahl and 75,841 for J. R. R. Tolkien. In 2015, the Christie estate claimed &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; was &quot;the best-selling crime novel of all time&quot;, with approximately 100 million sales, also making it one of the highest-selling books of all time. More than two million copies of her books were sold in English in 2020.

== Legacy ==

In 2016, the Royal Mail marked the centenary of Christie&#x27;s first detective story by issuing six first-class postage stamps of her works: &quot;The Mysterious Affair at Styles&quot;, &quot;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&quot;, &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot;, &quot;And Then There Were None&quot;, &quot;The Body in the Library&quot;, and &quot;A Murder is Announced&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that, &quot;Each design incorporates microtext, UV ink and thermochromic ink. These concealed clues can be revealed using either a magnifying glass, UV light or body heat and provide pointers to the mysteries&#x27; solutions.&quot;

Her characters and her face appeared on the stamps of many countries like Dominica and the Somali Republic. In 2020, Christie was commemorated on a £2 coin by the Royal Mint for the first time to mark the centenary of her first novel, &quot;The Mysterious Affair at Styles&quot;.

In 2023 a life-size bronze statue of Christie sitting on a park bench holding a book was unveiled in Wallingford, Oxfordshire.

=== Adaptations ===

Christie&#x27;s works have been adapted for cinema and television. The first was the 1928 British film &quot;The Passing of Mr. Quin&quot;. Poirot&#x27;s first film appearance was in 1931 in &quot;Alibi&quot;, which starred Austin Trevor as Christie&#x27;s sleuth. Margaret Rutherford played Marple in a series of films released in the 1960s. Christie liked her acting, but considered the first film &quot;pretty poor&quot; and thought no better of the rest.
She felt differently about the 1974 film &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot;, directed by Sidney Lumet, which featured major stars and high production values; her attendance at the London premiere was one of her last public outings. In 2017, a new film version was released, directed by Kenneth Branagh, who also starred, wearing &quot;the most extravagant mustache moviegoers have ever seen&quot;. Branagh has since directed two more adaptations of Christie, &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; (2022) and its sequel &quot;A Haunting in Venice&quot; (2023), the latter an adaptation of her 1969 novel &quot;Hallowe&#x27;en Party&quot;.

The television adaptation &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot; (1989–2013), with David Suchet in the title role, ran for 70 episodes over 13 series. It received nine BAFTA award nominations and won four BAFTA awards in 1990–1992. The television series &quot;Miss Marple&quot; (1984–1992), with Joan Hickson as &quot;the BBC&#x27;s peerless Miss Marple&quot;, adapted all 12 Marple novels. The French television series (2009–2012, 2013–2020), adapted 36 of Christie&#x27;s stories.

Christie&#x27;s books have also been adapted for BBC Radio, a video game series, and graphic novels.

== Interests and influences ==
=== Pharmacology ===

During the First World War, Christie took a break from nursing to train for the Apothecaries Hall Examination. While she subsequently found dispensing in the hospital pharmacy monotonous, and thus less enjoyable than nursing, her new knowledge provided her with a background in potentially toxic drugs. Early in the Second World War, she brought her skills up to date at Torquay Hospital.

As Michael C. Gerald puts it, her &quot;activities as a hospital dispenser during both World Wars not only supported the war effort but also provided her with an appreciation of drugs as therapeutic agents and poisons... These hospital experiences were also likely responsible for the prominent role physicians, nurses, and pharmacists play in her stories.&quot; There were to be many medical practitioners, pharmacists, and scientists, naïve or suspicious, in Christie&#x27;s cast of characters; featuring in &quot;Murder in Mesopotamia&quot;, &quot;Cards on the Table&quot;, &quot;The Pale Horse&quot;, and &quot;Mrs. McGinty&#x27;s Dead&quot;, among many others.

Gillian Gill notes that the murder method in Christie&#x27;s first detective novel, &quot;The Mysterious Affair at Styles&quot;, &quot;comes right out of Agatha Christie&#x27;s work in the hospital dispensary&quot;. In an interview with journalist Marcelle Bernstein, Christie stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t like messy deaths... I&#x27;m more interested in peaceful people who die in their own beds and no one knows why.&quot; With her expert knowledge, Christie had no need of poisons unknown to science, which were forbidden under Ronald Knox&#x27;s &quot;Ten Rules for Detective Fiction&quot;. Arsenic, aconite, strychnine, digitalis, nicotine, thallium, and other substances were used to dispatch victims in the ensuing decades.

=== Archaeology ===

In her youth, Christie showed little interest in antiquities. After her marriage to Mallowan in 1930, she accompanied him on annual expeditions, spending three to four months at a time in Syria and Iraq at excavation sites at Ur, Nineveh, Tell Arpachiyah, Chagar Bazar, Tell Brak, and Nimrud. The Mallowans also took side trips whilst travelling to and from expedition sites, visiting Italy, Greece, Egypt, Iran, and the Soviet Union, among other places. Their experiences travelling and living abroad are reflected in novels such as &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot;, &quot;Death on the Nile&quot;, and &quot;Appointment with Death&quot;.

For the 1931 digging season at Nineveh, Christie bought a writing table to continue her own work; in the early 1950s, she paid to add a small writing room to the team&#x27;s house at Nimrud. She also devoted time and effort each season in &quot;making herself useful by photographing, cleaning, and recording finds; and restoring ceramics, which she especially enjoyed&quot;. She also provided funds for the expeditions.

Many of the settings for Christie&#x27;s books were inspired by her archaeological fieldwork in the Middle East; this is reflected in the detail with which she describes themfor instance, the temple of Abu Simbel as depicted in &quot;Death on the Nile&quot;while the settings for &quot;They Came to Baghdad&quot; were places she and Mallowan had recently stayed. Similarly, she drew upon her knowledge of daily life on a dig throughout &quot;Murder in Mesopotamia&quot;. Archaeologists and experts in Middle Eastern cultures and artefacts featured in her works include Dr Eric Leidner in &quot;Murder in Mesopotamia&quot; and Signor Richetti in &quot;Death on the Nile&quot;.

After the Second World War, Christie chronicled her time in Syria in &quot;Come, Tell Me How You Live&quot;, which she described as &quot;small beera very little book, full of everyday doings and happenings&quot;. From 8November 2001 to March 2002, The British Museum presented a &quot;colourful and episodic exhibition&quot; called &quot;Agatha Christie and Archaeology: Mystery in Mesopotamia&quot; which illustrated how her activities as a writer and as the wife of an archaeologist intertwined.

== In popular culture ==
Some of Christie&#x27;s fictional portrayals have explored and offered accounts of her disappearance in 1926. The film &quot;Agatha&quot; (1979), with Vanessa Redgrave, has Christie sneaking away to plan revenge against her husband; Christie&#x27;s heirs sued unsuccessfully to prevent the film&#x27;s distribution. The &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;The Unicorn and the Wasp&quot; (17 May 2008) stars Fenella Woolgar as Christie, and explains her disappearance as being connected to aliens. The film &quot;Agatha and the Truth of Murder&quot; (2018) sends her undercover to solve the murder of Florence Nightingale&#x27;s goddaughter, Florence Nightingale Shore. A fictionalised account of Christie&#x27;s disappearance is also the central theme of a Korean musical, &quot;Agatha&quot;. &quot;The Christie Affair&quot;, a Christie-like mystery story of love and revenge by author Nina de Gramont, was a 2022 novel loosely based on Christie&#x27;s disappearance.

Other portrayals, such as the Hungarian film &quot;Kojak Budapesten&quot; (1980), create their own scenarios involving Christie&#x27;s criminal skills. In the TV play &quot;Murder by the Book&quot; (1986), Christie (Dame Peggy Ashcroft) murders one of her fictional-turned-real characters, Poirot. Christie features as a character in Gaylord Larsen&#x27;s &quot;Dorothy and Agatha&quot; and &quot;The London Blitz Murders&quot; by Max Allan Collins. The American television program &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; devoted a segment to her famous disappearance, with Agatha portrayed by actress Tessa Pritchard. A young Agatha is depicted in the Spanish historical television series &quot;Gran Hotel&quot; (2011) in which she finds inspiration to write her new novel while aiding local detectives. In the alternative history television film &quot;Agatha and the Curse of Ishtar&quot; (2018), Christie becomes involved in a murder case at an archaeological dig in Iraq. In 2019, Honeysuckle Weeks portrayed Christie in &quot;No Friends Like Old Friends&quot; (September 16, 2019), episode 1 of season 3 of the Canadian television period detective series Frankie Drake Mysteries when Christie helps visiting private detective Frankie Drake solve the disappearance and poisoning of an old friend.

In 2020, Heather Terrell, under the pseudonym of Marie Benedict, published &quot;The Mystery of Mrs. Christie&quot;, a fictional reconstruction of Christie&#x27;s December 1926 disappearance. The novel was on the &quot;USA Today&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller lists. In December 2020, Library Reads named Terrell a Hall of Fame author for the book.
Andrew Wilson has written four novels featuring Agatha Christie as a detective: &quot;A Talent For Murder&quot; (2017), &quot;A Different Kind of Evil&quot; (2018), &quot;Death In A Desert Land&quot; (2019) and &quot;I Saw Him Die&quot; (2020). Christie was portrayed by Shirley Henderson in the 2022 comedy/mystery film &quot;See How They Run&quot;.
