<text>Harry Lillis &quot;Bing&quot; Crosby Jr. (May 3, 1903 – October 14, 1977) was an American singer and actor. The first multimedia star, he was one of the most popular and influential musical artists of the 20th century worldwide. Crosby was a leader in record sales, network radio ratings, and motion picture grosses from 1926 to 1977. He was one of the first global cultural icons. Crosby made over 70 feature films and recorded more than 1,600 songs.

Crosby&#x27;s early career coincided with recording innovations that allowed him to develop an intimate singing style that influenced many male singers who followed, such as Frank Sinatra, Perry Como, Dean Martin, Dick Haymes, Elvis Presley, and John Lennon. &quot;Yank&quot; magazine said that Crosby was &quot;the person who had done the most for the morale of overseas servicemen&quot; during World War II. In 1948, American polls declared him the &quot;most admired man alive&quot;, ahead of Jackie Robinson and Pope Pius XII. In 1948, &quot;Music Digest&quot; estimated that Crosby&#x27;s recordings filled more than half of the 80,000 weekly hours allocated to recorded radio music in America.

Crosby won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in &quot;Going My Way&quot; (1944) and was nominated for its sequel, &quot;The Bells of St. Mary&#x27;s&quot; (1945), opposite Ingrid Bergman, becoming the first of six actors to be nominated twice for playing the same character. Crosby was the number one box office attraction for five consecutive years from 1944 to 1948. At his screen apex in 1946, Crosby starred in three of the year&#x27;s five highest-grossing films: &quot;The Bells of St. Mary&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Blue Skies&quot;, and &quot;Road to Utopia&quot;. In 1963, he received the first Grammy Global Achievement Award. Crosby is one of 33 people to have three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, in the categories of motion pictures, radio, and audio recording. He was also known for his collaborations with his friend Bob Hope, starring in the &quot;Road to ...&quot; films from 1940 to 1962.

Crosby influenced the development of the post–World War II recording industry. After seeing a demonstration of a German broadcast quality reel-to-reel tape recorder brought to the United States by John T. Mullin, Crosby invested $50,000 in the California electronics company Ampex to build copies. He then persuaded ABC to allow him to tape his shows and became the first performer to prerecord his radio shows and master his commercial recordings onto magnetic tape. Crosby has been associated with the Christmas season since he starred in Irving Berlin&#x27;s musical film &quot;Holiday Inn&quot; and also sang &quot;White Christmas&quot; in the film of the same name. Through audio recordings, Crosby produced his radio programs with the same directorial tools and craftsmanship (editing, retaking, rehearsal, time shifting) used in motion picture production, a practice that became the industry standard. In addition to his work with early audio tape recording, Crosby helped finance the development of videotape, bought television stations, bred racehorses, and co-owned the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team, during which time the team won two World Series (1960 and 1971).

==Early life==
Crosby was born on May 3, 1903, in Tacoma, Washington, in a house his father built at 1112 North J Street. Three years later, his family moved to Spokane in Eastern Washington state, where Crosby was raised. In 1913, his father built a house at 508 E. Sharp Avenue. The house stands on the campus of Crosby&#x27;s alma mater, Gonzaga University, as a museum housing over 200 artifacts from his life and career, including his Oscar.

Crosby was the fourth of seven children: brothers Laurence Earl &quot;Larry&quot; (1895–1975), Everett Nathaniel (1896–1966), Edward John &quot;Ted&quot; (1900–1973), and George Robert &quot;Bob&quot; (1913–1993); and two sisters, Catherine Cordelia (1904–1974) and Mary Rose (1906–1990). His parents were Harry Lillis Crosby (1870–1950), a bookkeeper, and Catherine Helen &quot;Kate&quot; (née Harrigan; 1873–1964). His mother was a second-generation Irish-American. His father was of Scottish and English descent; an ancestor, Simon Crosby, emigrated from the Kingdom of England to New England in the 1630s during the Puritan migration to New England. Through another line, also on his father&#x27;s side, Crosby is descended from &quot;Mayflower&quot; passenger William Brewster ( 1567 – 1644).

In 1917, Crosby took a summer job as property boy at Spokane&#x27;s Auditorium, where he witnessed some of the acts of the day, including Al Jolson, who held Crosby spellbound with ad-libbing and parodies of Hawaiian songs. Crosby later described Jolson&#x27;s delivery as &quot;electric&quot;.

Crosby graduated from Gonzaga High School in 1920 and enrolled at Gonzaga University. He attended Gonzaga for three years but did not earn a degree. As a freshman, Crosby played on the university&#x27;s baseball team. The university granted him an honorary doctorate in 1937. Gonzaga University houses a large collection of photographs, correspondence, and other material related to Crosby.

On November 8, 1937, after Lux Radio Theatre&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;She Loves Me Not&quot;, Joan Blondell asked Crosby how he got his nickname:
As it happens, that story was pure whimsy for dramatic effect; the Associated Press had reported as early as February 1932—as would later be confirmed by both Bing himself and his biographer Charles Thompson—that it was in fact a neighbor—Valentine Hobart, circa 1910—who had named him &quot;Bingo from Bingville&quot; after a comic feature in the local paper called &quot;The Bingville Bugle&quot; which the young Harry liked. In time, Bingo got shortened to Bing.

==Career==
===Early years===
In 1923, Crosby was invited to join a new band composed of high-school students a few years younger than himself. Al and Miles Rinker (brothers of singer Mildred Bailey), James Heaton, Claire Pritchard and Robert Pritchard, along with drummer Crosby, formed the Musicaladers, who performed at dances both for high school students and club-goers. The group performed on Spokane radio station KHQ, but disbanded after two years. Crosby and Al Rinker obtained work at the Clemmer Theatre in Spokane (now known as the Bing Crosby Theater).

On August 14, 1925, Bing appeared at the Clemmer Theater as part of The Clemmer Trio (Frank McBride, Lloyd Grinnell and Harry Crosby) and they were shown as being presented with special stage effects. Rinker played piano in the pit. They continued at the theater alongside the film of the week for a very successful 12 weeks. They were initially billed as The Clemmer Trio and later as The Clemmer Entertainers depending who performed.

In October 1925, Crosby and Rinker decided to seek fame in California. They traveled to Los Angeles, where Bailey introduced them to her show business contacts. The Fanchon and Marco Time Agency hired them for 13 weeks for the revue &quot;The Syncopation Idea&quot; starting at the Boulevard Theater in Los Angeles and then on the Loew&#x27;s circuit. They each earned $75 a week. As minor parts of &quot;The Syncopation Idea&quot;, Crosby and Rinker started to develop as entertainers. They had a lively style that was popular with college students. After &quot;The Syncopation Idea&quot; closed, they worked in the Will Morrissey Music Hall Revue. They honed their skills with Morrissey, and when they got a chance to present an independent act, they were spotted by a member of the Paul Whiteman organization.

Whiteman needed something different to break up his musical selections, and Crosby and Rinker filled this requirement. After less than a year in show business, they were attached to one of the biggest names. Hired for $150 a week in 1926, they debuted with Whiteman on December 6 at the Tivoli Theatre in Chicago. Their first recording, in October 1926, was &quot;I&#x27;ve Got the Girl&quot; with Don Clark&#x27;s Orchestra, but the Columbia-issued record was inadvertently recorded at a slow speed, which increased the singers&#x27; pitch when played at 78 rpm. Throughout his career, Crosby often credited Bailey for getting him his first important job in the entertainment business.

===The Rhythm Boys===

Success with Whiteman was followed by disaster when they reached New York. Whiteman considered letting them go. However, the addition of pianist and aspiring songwriter Harry Barris made the difference, and The Rhythm Boys were born. The additional voice meant they could be heard more easily in large New York theaters. Crosby gained valuable experience on tour for a year with Whiteman and performing and recording with Bix Beiderbecke, Jack Teagarden, Tommy Dorsey, Jimmy Dorsey, Eddie Lang, and Hoagy Carmichael. Crosby matured as a performer and was in demand as a solo singer.

Crosby became the star attraction of the Rhythm Boys. In 1928, he had his first number one hit, a jazz-influenced rendition of &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot;. In 1929, the Rhythm Boys appeared in the film &quot;King of Jazz&quot; with Whiteman, but Crosby&#x27;s growing dissatisfaction with Whiteman led to the Rhythm Boys leaving his organization. They joined the Gus Arnheim Orchestra, performing nightly in the Coconut Grove of the Ambassador Hotel. Singing with the Arnheim Orchestra, Crosby&#x27;s solos began to steal the show while the Rhythm Boys&#x27; act gradually became redundant. Harry Barris wrote several of Crosby&#x27;s hits, including &quot;At Your Command&quot;, &quot;I Surrender Dear&quot;, and &quot;Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams&quot;. When Mack Sennett signed Crosby to a solo film contract in 1931, a break with the Rhythm Boys became almost inevitable. Crosby married Dixie Lee in September 1930. After a threat of divorce in March 1931, he applied himself to his career.

===Success as a solo singer===
On September 2, 1931, &quot;15 Minutes with Bing Crosby&quot;, his nationwide solo radio debut, began broadcasting. The weekly broadcast made Crosby a hit. Before the end of the year, he with both Brunswick Records and CBS Radio. &quot;Out of Nowhere&quot;, &quot;Just One More Chance&quot;, &quot;At Your Command&quot;, and &quot;I Found a Million Dollar Baby (in a Five and Ten Cent Store)&quot; were among the best-selling songs of 1931.

Ten of the top 50 songs of 1931 included Crosby with others or as a solo act. A &quot;Battle of the Baritones&quot; with singer Russ Columbo proved short-lived, replaced with the slogan &quot;Bing Was King&quot;. Crosby played the lead in a series of musical comedy short films for Mack Sennett, signed with Paramount, and starred in his first full-length film, 1932&#x27;s &quot;The Big Broadcast&quot; (1932), the first of 55 films in which he received top billing. Crosby would appear in almost 80 pictures. He signed a contract with Jack Kapp&#x27;s new record company, Decca, in late 1934.

Crosby&#x27;s first commercial sponsor on radio was Cremo Cigars and his fame spread nationwide. After a long run in New York, Crosby went back to Hollywood to film &quot;The Big Broadcast&quot;. His appearances, records, and radio work substantially increased his impact. The success of his first film brought Crosby a contract with Paramount, and he began a pattern of making three films a year. Crosby led his radio show for Woodbury Soap for two seasons while his live appearances dwindled. Crosby&#x27;s records produced hits during the Depression when sales were down. Audio engineer Steve Hoffman stated, &quot;By the way, Bing actually saved the record business in 1934 when he agreed to support Decca founder Jack Kapp&#x27;s crazy idea of lowering the price of singles from a dollar to 35 cents and getting a royalty for records sold instead of a flat fee. Bing&#x27;s name and his artistry saved the recording industry. All the other artists signed to Decca after Bing did. Without him, Jack Kapp wouldn&#x27;t have had a chance in hell of making Decca work and the Great Depression would have wiped out phonograph records for good.&quot;

His first son Gary was born in 1933 with twin boys following in 1934. By 1936, Crosby replaced his former boss, Paul Whiteman, as host of the weekly NBC radio program &quot;Kraft Music Hall&quot;, where he remained for the next decade. &quot;Where the Blue of the Night (Meets the Gold of the Day)&quot;, with his trademark whistling, became his theme song and signature tune.

Crosby&#x27;s vocal style helped take popular singing beyond the &quot;belting&quot; associated with Al Jolson and Billy Murray, who had been obligated to reach the back seats in New York theaters without the aid of a microphone. As music critic Henry Pleasants noted in &quot;The Great American Popular Singers&quot;, something new had entered American music, a style that might be called &quot;singing in American&quot; with conversational ease. This new sound led to the popular epithet &quot;crooner&quot;.

Crosby admired Louis Armstrong for his musical ability, and the trumpet maestro was a formative influence on Crosby&#x27;s singing style. When the two met, they became friends. In 1936, Crosby exercised an option in his Paramount contract to regularly star in an out-of-house film. Signing an agreement with Columbia for a single motion picture, Crosby wanted Armstrong to appear in a screen adaptation of &quot;The Peacock Feather&quot; that eventually became &quot;Pennies from Heaven&quot;. Crosby asked Harry Cohn, but Cohn had no desire to pay for the flight or to meet Armstrong&#x27;s &quot;crude, mob-linked but devoted manager, Joe Glaser&quot;. Crosby threatened to leave the film and refused to discuss the matter. Cohn gave in; Armstrong&#x27;s musical scenes and comic dialogue extended his influence to the silver screen, creating more opportunities for him and other African Americans to appear in future films. Crosby also ensured behind the scenes that Armstrong received equal billing with his white co-stars. Armstrong appreciated Crosby&#x27;s progressive attitudes on race, and often expressed gratitude for the role in later years.

During World War II, Crosby made live appearances before American troops who had been fighting in the European Theater. He learned how to pronounce German from written scripts and read propaganda broadcasts intended for German forces. The nickname &quot;Der Bingle&quot; was common among Crosby&#x27;s German listeners and came to be used by his English-speaking fans. In a poll of U.S. troops at the close of World War II, Crosby topped the list as the person who had done the most for G.I. morale, ahead of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, General Dwight Eisenhower, and Bob Hope.

The June 18, 1945, issue of &quot;Life&quot; magazine stated, &quot;America&#x27;s number one star, Bing Crosby, has won more fans, made more money than any entertainer in history. Today he is a kind of national institution.&quot; &quot;In all, 60,000,000 Crosby discs have been marketed since he made his first record in 1931. His biggest best seller is &quot;White Christmas&quot; 2,000,000 impressions of which have been sold in the U.S. and 250,000 in Great Britain.&quot; &quot;Nine out of ten singers and bandleaders listen to Crosby&#x27;s broadcasts each Thursday night and follow his lead. The day after he sings a song over the air—any song—some 50,000 copies of it are sold throughout the U.S. Time and again Crosby has taken some new or unknown ballad, has given it what is known in trade circles as the &#x27;big goose&#x27; and made it a hit single-handed and overnight... Precisely what the future holds for Crosby neither his family nor his friends can conjecture. He has achieved greater popularity, made more money, attracted vaster audiences than any other entertainer in history. And his star is still in the ascendant. His contract with Decca runs until 1955. His contract with Paramount runs until 1954. Records which he made ten years ago are selling better than ever before. The nation&#x27;s appetite for Crosby&#x27;s voice and personality appears insatiable. To soldiers overseas and to foreigners he has become a kind of symbol of America, of the amiable, humorous citizen of a free land. Crosby, however, seldom bothers to contemplate his future. For one thing, he enjoys hearing himself sing, and if ever a day should dawn when the public wearies of him, he will complacently go right on singing—to himself.&quot;

====White Christmas====


The biggest hit song of Crosby&#x27;s career was his recording of Irving Berlin&#x27;s &quot;White Christmas&quot;, which Crosby introduced on a Christmas Day radio broadcast in 1941. A copy of the recording from the radio program is owned by the estate of Bing Crosby and was loaned to &quot;CBS Sunday Morning&quot; for their December 25, 2011, program. The song appeared in his films &quot;Holiday Inn&quot; (1942), and—a decade later—in &quot;White Christmas&quot; (1954). Crosby&#x27;s record hit the charts on October 3, 1942, and rose to number 1 on October 31, where it stayed for 11 weeks. A holiday perennial, the song was repeatedly re-released by Decca, charting another 16 times. It topped the charts again in 1945 and a third time in January 1947. The song remains the bestselling single of all time. Crosby&#x27;s recording of &quot;White Christmas&quot; has sold over 50 million copies worldwide. His recording was so popular that Crosby was obliged to re-record it in 1947 using the same musicians and backup singers; the original 1942 master had become damaged due to its frequent use in pressing additional singles. In 1977, after Crosby died, the song was re-released and reached No. 5 in the UK Singles Chart. Crosby was dismissive of his role in the song&#x27;s success, saying &quot;a jackdaw with a cleft palate could have sung it successfully&quot;.

===Motion pictures===

In the wake of a solid decade of headlining mainly smash hit musical comedy films in the 1930s, Crosby starred with Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour in six of the seven &quot;Road to&quot; musical comedies between 1940 and 1962 (Lamour was replaced with Joan Collins in &quot;The Road to Hong Kong&quot; and limited to a lengthy cameo), cementing Crosby and Hope as an on-and-off duo, despite never declaring themselves a &quot;team&quot; in the sense that Laurel and Hardy or Martin and Lewis (Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis) were teams. The series consists of &quot;Road to Singapore&quot; (1940), &quot;Road to Zanzibar&quot; (1941), &quot;Road to Morocco&quot; (1942), &quot;Road to Utopia&quot; (1946), &quot;Road to Rio&quot; (1947), &quot;Road to Bali&quot; (1952), and &quot;The Road to Hong Kong&quot; (1962). When they appeared solo, Crosby and Hope frequently made note of the other in a comically insulting fashion. They performed together countless times on stage, radio, film, and television, and made numerous brief and not so brief appearances together in movies aside from the &quot;Road&quot; pictures, &quot;Variety Girl&quot; (1947) being an example of lengthy scenes and songs together along with billing.

In the 1949 Disney animated film &quot;The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad&quot;, Crosby provided the narration and song vocals for &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot; segment. In 1960, he starred in &quot;High Time&quot;, a collegiate comedy with Fabian Forte and Tuesday Weld that predicted the emerging gap between Crosby and the new younger generation of musicians and actors who had begun their careers after World War II. The following year, Crosby and Hope reunited for one more &quot;Road&quot; movie, &quot;The Road to Hong Kong&quot;, which teamed them up with the much younger Joan Collins and Peter Sellers. Collins was used in place of their longtime partner Dorothy Lamour, whom Crosby felt was getting too old for the role, though Hope refused to do the film without her, and she instead made a lengthy and elaborate cameo appearance. Shortly before his death in 1977, Crosby had planned another &quot;Road&quot; film in which he, Hope, and Lamour search for the Fountain of Youth.

Crosby won an Academy Award for Best Actor for &quot;Going My Way&quot; in 1944 and was nominated for the 1945 sequel, &quot;The Bells of St. Mary&#x27;s&quot;. He received critical acclaim and his third Academy Award nomination for his performance as an alcoholic entertainer in &quot;The Country Girl&quot;.

===Television===

&quot;The Fireside Theater&quot; (1950) was his first television production. The series of 26-minute shows was filmed at Hal Roach Studios rather than performed live on the air. The &quot;telefilms&quot; were syndicated to individual television stations. Crosby was a frequent guest on the musical variety shows of the 1950s and 1960s, appearing on various variety shows as well as numerous late-night talk shows and his own highly rated specials. Bob Hope memorably devoted one of his monthly NBC specials to his long intermittent partnership with Crosby titled &quot;On the Road With Bing&quot;. Crosby was associated with ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Hollywood Palace&quot; as the show&#x27;s first and most frequent guest host and appeared annually on its Christmas edition with his wife Kathryn and his younger children, and continued after &quot;The Hollywood Palace&quot; was eventually canceled. In the early 1970s, Crosby made two late appearances on the &quot;Flip Wilson Show&quot;, singing duets with the comedian. His last TV appearance was a Christmas special, &quot;Merrie Olde Christmas&quot;, taped in London in September 1977 and aired weeks after his death. It was on this special that Crosby recorded a duet of &quot;The Little Drummer Boy&quot; and &quot;Peace on Earth&quot; with rock musician David Bowie. Their duet was released in 1982 as a single 45 rpm record and reached No. 3 in the UK singles charts. It has since become a staple of holiday radio and the final popular hit of Crosby&#x27;s career. At the end of the 20th century, &quot;TV Guide&quot; listed the Crosby-Bowie duet one of the 25 most memorable musical moments of 20th-century television.

Bing Crosby Productions, affiliated with Desilu Studios and later CBS Television Studios, produced a number of television series, including Crosby&#x27;s own unsuccessful ABC sitcom &quot;The Bing Crosby Show&quot; in the 1964–1965 season (with co-stars Beverly Garland and Frank McHugh). The company produced two ABC medical dramas, &quot;Ben Casey&quot; (1961–1966) and &quot;Breaking Point&quot; (1963–1964), the popular &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot; (1965–1971) military comedy on CBS, as well as the lesser-known show &quot;Slattery&#x27;s People&quot; (1964–1965).

==Singing style and vocal characteristics==
Crosby was one of the first singers to exploit the intimacy of the microphone rather than use the loud, penetrating vaudeville style associated with Al Jolson. Crosby was, by his own definition, a &quot;phraser&quot;, a singer who placed equal emphasis on both the lyrics and the music. Paul Whiteman&#x27;s hiring of Crosby, with phrasing that echoed jazz, particularly his bandmate Bix Beiderbecke&#x27;s trumpet, helped bring the genre to a wider audience. In the framework of the novelty-singing style of the Rhythm Boys, Crosby bent notes and added off-tune phrasing, an approach that was rooted in jazz. He had already been introduced to Louis Armstrong and Bessie Smith before his first appearance on record. Crosby and Armstrong remained warm acquaintances for decades, occasionally singing together in later years, e.g. &quot;Now You Has Jazz&quot; in the film &quot;High Society&quot; (1956). In Crosby&#x27;s performances, the presence of jazz phrasing, jazz rhythm and jazz improvisation varied depending on the piece of music, but those were elements that Crosby frequently used. This can be observed particularly in his straight jazz work during the late 1920s/early 1930s, Crosby&#x27;s recordings with Buddy Cole and His Trio from the mid-1950s, as well as in his numerous collaborations with such jazz musicians as Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, Joe Venuti, or Eddie Lang. However, while Crosby can be called a jazz singer, he was not strictly only a jazz singer as he modeled the style and techniques to a broad scope of music that he performed, ranging from Jazz to Country to even such material as operetta arias.

During the early portion of his solo career (about 1931–1934), Crosby&#x27;s emotional, often pleading style of crooning was popular. But Jack Kapp, manager of Brunswick and later Decca, talked Crosby into dropping many of his jazzier mannerisms in favor of a clear vocal style. Crosby credited Kapp for choosing hit songs, working with many other musicians, and most important, diversifying his repertoire into several styles and genres. Kapp helped Crosby have number one hits in Christmas music, Hawaiian music, and country music, and top-30 hits in Irish music, French music, rhythm and blues, and ballads.

Crosby elaborated on an idea of Al Jolson&#x27;s: phrasing, or the art of making a song&#x27;s lyric ring true. &quot;I used to tell Sinatra over and over,&quot; said Tommy Dorsey, &quot;there&#x27;s only one singer you ought to listen to and his name is Crosby. All that matters to him is the words, and that&#x27;s the only thing that ought to for you, too.&quot;

Critic Henry Pleasants wrote in 1985: [While] the octave B flat to B flat in Bing&#x27;s voice at that time [1930s] is, to my ears, one of the loveliest I have heard in forty-five years of listening to baritones, both classical and popular, it dropped conspicuously in later years. From the mid-1950s, Bing was more comfortable in a bass range while maintaining a baritone quality, with the best octave being G to G, or even F to F. In a recording he made of &#x27;Dardanella&#x27; with Louis Armstrong in 1960, he attacks lightly and easily on a low E flat. This is lower than most opera basses care to venture, and they tend to sound as if they were in the cellar when they get there.

==Career achievements==
Crosby&#x27;s was among the most popular and successful musical acts of the 20th century. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine used different methodologies during his career, but his chart success remains impressive: 396 chart singles, including roughly 41 number 1 hits. Crosby had separate charting singles every year between 1931 and 1954; the annual re-release of &quot;White Christmas&quot; extended that streak to 1957. He had 24 separate popular singles in 1939 alone. Statistician Joel Whitburn at &quot;Billboard&quot; determined that Crosby was America&#x27;s most successful recording act of the 1930s and again in the 1940s.

The number of Bing Crosby record sales varies. Organizations that audit record sales do not have an official tally, but some claim sales are notable, namely: In 1960, Crosby was honored as &quot;First Citizen of Record Industry&quot; based on having sold 200 million discs. The Guinness Book reported some of the singer&#x27;s worldwide sales on a few occasions: In 1973, Crosby had sold more than 400 million records worldwide, and by 1977 he had sold 500 million discs, being ranked as the most successful and best-selling musical artist in 1978. Some sources contradict these alleged sales to the Guinness Book, as it is not an organization that counts or audits artists&#x27; sales in the United States or worldwide. According to different sources, Bing Crosby&#x27;s sales number varies between: 300 million, 500 million, or even 1 billion, making him one of the best-selling singers in history. The single &quot;White Christmas&quot; sold over 50 million copies according to &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;.

For 15 years (1934, 1937, 1940, 1943–1954), Crosby was among the top 10 acts in box-office sales, and for five of those years (1944–1948) he topped the world. Crosby sang four Academy Award-winning songs—&quot;Sweet Leilani&quot; (1937), &quot;White Christmas&quot; (1942), &quot;Swinging on a Star&quot; (1944), &quot;In the Cool, Cool, Cool of the Evening&quot; (1951)—and won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in &quot;Going My Way&quot; (1944).

A survey in 2000 found that with 1,077,900,000 movie tickets sold, Crosby was the third-most-popular actor of all time, behind Clark Gable (1,168,300,000) and John Wayne (1,114,000,000). The &quot;International Motion Picture Almanac&quot; lists Crosby in a tie for second-most years at number one on the All Time Number One Stars List with Clint Eastwood, Tom Hanks, and Burt Reynolds. His most popular film, &quot;White Christmas&quot;, grossed $30 million in 1954 ($ million in current value).

Crosby received 23 gold and platinum records, according to the book &quot;Million Selling Records&quot;. The Recording Industry Association of America did not institute its gold record certification program until 1958 when Crosby&#x27;s record sales were low. Before 1958, gold records were awarded by record companies. Crosby charted 23 &quot;Billboard&quot; hits from 47 recorded songs with the Andrews Sisters, whose Decca record sales were second only to Crosby&#x27;s throughout the 1940s. They were his most frequent collaborators on disc from 1939 to 1952, a partnership that produced four million-selling singles: &quot;Pistol Packin&#x27; Mama&quot;, &quot;Jingle Bells&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Fence Me In&quot;, and &quot;South America, Take It Away&quot;.

They made one film appearance together in &quot;Road to Rio&quot; singing &quot;You Don&#x27;t Have to Know the Language&quot;, and sang together on radio airwaves throughout the 1940s and 1950s. They appeared as guests on each other&#x27;s shows and on Armed Forces Radio Service programming during and after World War II. The quartet&#x27;s additional Top-10 &quot;Billboard&quot; hits from 1943 to 1945 include &quot;The Vict&#x27;ry Polka&quot;, &quot;There&#x27;ll Be a Hot Time in the Town of Berlin (When the Yanks Go Marching In)&quot;, and &quot;Is You Is or Is You Ain&#x27;t (Ma&#x27; Baby?)&quot; which helped the morale of the American public.

In 1962, Crosby was given the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. He has been inducted into the halls of fame for both radio and popular music. In 2007, Crosby was inducted into the Hit Parade Hall of Fame and in 2008 the Western Music Hall of Fame.

==Popularity and influence==
Crosby&#x27;s popularity around the world was such that Dorothy Masuka, the best-selling African recording artist, stated that, &quot;Only Bing Crosby the famous American crooner sold more records than me in Africa.&quot; His great popularity throughout the continent led other African singers to emulate him, including Masuka, Dolly Rathebe, and Míriam Makeba, known locally as &quot;The Bing Crosby of Africa&quot;.

Presenter Mike Douglas commented in a 1975 interview, &quot;During my days in the Navy in World War II, I remember walking the streets of Calcutta, India, on the coast; it was a lonely night, so far from my home and from my new wife, Gen. I needed something to lift my spirits. As I passed a Hindu sitting on the corner of a street, I heard something surprisingly familiar. I came back to see the man playing one of those old Vitrolas, like those of RCA with the horn speaker. The man was listening to Bing Crosby sing, &quot;Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate The Positive&quot;. I stopped and smiled in grateful acknowledgment. The Hindu nodded and smiled back. The whole world knew and loved Bing Crosby.&quot; His popularity in India led many Hindu singers to imitate and emulate him, notably Kishore Kumar, considered the &quot;Bing Crosby of India&quot;.

Throughout Europe and Russia, Crosby was also known as &quot;Der Bingle&quot;, a pseudonym coined in 1944 by Bob Musel, an American journalist based in London, after Crosby had recorded three 15-minute programs with Jack Russin for broadcast to Germany from ABSIE.

==Entrepreneurship==
According to Shoshana Klebanoff, Crosby became one of the richest men in the history of show business. He had investments in real estate, mines, oil wells, cattle ranches, race horses, music publishing, baseball teams, and television. Crosby made a fortune from the Minute Maid Orange Juice Corporation, in which he was a principal stockholder.

===Role in early tape recording===
During the Golden Age of Radio, performers had to create their shows live, sometimes even redoing the program a second time for the West Coast time zone. Crosby had to do two live radio shows on the same day, three hours apart, for the East and West Coasts. Crosby&#x27;s radio career took a significant turn in 1945, when he clashed with NBC over his insistence that he be allowed to pre-record his radio shows. The live production of radio shows was reinforced by the musicians&#x27; union and ASCAP, which wanted to ensure continued work for their members. In &quot;On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio&quot;, John Dunning wrote about German engineers having developed a tape recorder with a near-professional broadcast quality standard:
Crosby&#x27;s insistence eventually factored into the further development of magnetic tape sound recording and the radio industry&#x27;s widespread adoption of it. He used his clout, both professionally and financially, for innovations in audio. But NBC and CBS refused to broadcast prerecorded radio programs. Crosby left the network and remained off the air for seven months, creating a legal battle with his sponsor Kraft that was settled out of court. Crosby returned to broadcasting for the last 13 weeks of the 1945–1946 season.

The Mutual Network, on the other hand, pre-recorded some of its programs as early as 1938 for &quot;The Shadow&quot; with Orson Welles. ABC was formed from the sale of the NBC Blue Network in 1943 after a federal antitrust suit and was willing to join Mutual in breaking the tradition. ABC offered Crosby $30,000 per week to produce a recorded show every Wednesday that would be sponsored by Philco. He would get an additional $40,000 from 400 independent stations for the rights to broadcast the 30-minute show, which was sent to them every Monday on three lacquer discs that played ten minutes per side at rpm.

Murdo MacKenzie of Bing Crosby Enterprises had seen a demonstration of the German Magnetophon in June 1947—the same device that Jack Mullin had brought back from Radio Frankfurt with 50 reels of tape, at the end of the war. It was one of the magnetic tape recorders that BASF and AEG had built in Germany starting in 1935. The 6.5 mm ferric-oxide-coated tape could record 20 minutes per reel of high-quality sound. Alexander M. Poniatoff ordered Ampex, which he founded in 1944, to manufacture an improved version of the Magnetophone.

Crosby hired Mullin to start recording his &quot;Philco Radio Time&quot; show on his German-made machine in August 1947 using the same 50 reels of I.G. Farben magnetic tape that Mullin had found at a radio station at Bad Nauheim near Frankfurt while working for the U.S. Army Signal Corps. The advantage was editing. As Crosby wrote in his autobiography:
Mullin&#x27;s 1976 memoir of these early days of experimental recording agrees with Crosby&#x27;s account:
Crosby invested $50,000 in Ampex with the intent to produce more machines. In 1948, the second season of Philco shows was recorded with the Ampex Model 200A and Scotch 111 tape from 3M. Mullin explained how one new broadcasting technique was invented on the Crosby show with these machines:

Crosby started the tape recorder revolution in America. In his 1950 film &quot;Mr. Music&quot;, Crosby is seen singing into an Ampex tape recorder that reproduced his voice better than anything else. Also quick to adopt tape recording was his friend Bob Hope. Crosby gave one of the first Ampex Model 300 recorders to his friend, guitarist Les Paul, which led to Paul&#x27;s invention of multitrack recording. His organization, the Crosby Research Foundation, held tape recording patents and developed equipment and recording techniques such as the laugh track that are still in use.

With Frank Sinatra, Crosby was one of the principal backers for the United Western Recorders studio complex in Los Angeles.

===Videotape development===
Mullin continued to work for Crosby to develop a videotape recorder (VTR). Television production was mostly live television in its early years, but Crosby wanted the same ability to record that he had achieved in radio. &quot;The Fireside Theater&quot; (1950) sponsored by Procter &amp; Gamble, was his first television production. Mullin had not yet succeeded with videotape, so Crosby filmed the series of 26-minute shows at the Hal Roach Studios, and the &quot;telefilms&quot; were syndicated to individual television stations.

Crosby continued to finance the development of videotape. Bing Crosby Enterprises gave the world&#x27;s first demonstration of videotape recording in Los Angeles on November 11, 1951. Developed by John T. Mullin and Wayne R. Johnson since 1950, the device aired what were described as &quot;blurred and indistinct&quot; images, using a modified Ampex 200 tape recorder and standard quarter-inch (6.3 mm) audio tape moving at per second.

===Television station ownership===
A Crosby-led group purchased station KCOP-TV, in Los Angeles, California, in 1954. NAFI Corporation and Crosby purchased television station KPTV in Portland, Oregon, for $4 million on September 1, 1959. In 1960, NAFI purchased KCOP from Crosby&#x27;s group. In the early 1950s, Crosby helped establish the CBS television affiliate in his hometown of Spokane, Washington. Crosby partnered with Ed Craney, who owned the CBS radio affiliate KXLY (AM) and built a television studio west of Crosby&#x27;s alma mater, Gonzaga University. After it began broadcasting, the station was sold within a year to Northern Pacific Radio and Television Corporation.

===Thoroughbred horse racing===
Crosby was a fan of thoroughbred horse racing and bought his first racehorse in 1935. Two years later, Crosby became a founding partner of the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club and a member of its board of directors. Operating from the Del Mar Racetrack in Del Mar, California, the group included millionaire businessman Charles S. Howard, who owned a successful racing stable that included Seabiscuit. Charles&#x27; son, Lindsay C. Howard, became one of Crosby&#x27;s closest friends; Crosby named his son Lindsay after him, and would purchase his 40-room Hillsborough, California, estate from Lindsay in 1965.

Crosby and Lindsay Howard formed Binglin Stable to race and breed thoroughbred horses at a ranch in Moorpark in Ventura County, California. They also established the Binglin Stock Farm in Argentina, where they raced horses at Hipódromo de Palermo in Palermo, Buenos Aires. A number of Argentine-bred horses were purchased and shipped to race in the United States. On August 12, 1938, the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club hosted a $25,000 winner-take-all match race won by Charles S. Howard&#x27;s Seabiscuit over Binglin&#x27;s horse Ligaroti. In 1943, Binglin&#x27;s horse Don Bingo won the Suburban Handicap at Belmont Park in Elmont, New York. The Binglin Stable partnership came to an end in 1953 as a result of a liquidation of assets by Crosby, who needed to raise enough funds to pay the hefty federal and state inheritance taxes on his deceased wife&#x27;s estate. The Bing Crosby Breeders&#x27; Cup Handicap at Del Mar Racetrack is named in his honor.

==Sports==
Crosby had a keen interest in sports. In the 1930s, his friend and former college classmate, Gonzaga head coach Mike Pecarovich, appointed Crosby as an assistant football coach. From 1946 until his death, Crosby owned a 25% share of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Although he was passionate about the team, Crosby was too nervous to watch the deciding Game 7 of the 1960 World Series, choosing to go to Paris with Kathryn and listen to its radio broadcast. Crosby had arranged for Ampex, another of his financial investments, to record the NBC telecast on kinescope. The game was one of the most famous in baseball history, capped off by Bill Mazeroski&#x27;s walk-off home run that won the game for Pittsburgh. Crosby apparently viewed the complete film just once, and then stored it in his wine cellar, where it remained undisturbed until it was discovered in December 2009. The restored broadcast was shown on MLB Network in December 2010.

Crosby was also an early investor in Bob Cobb&#x27;s Billings Mustangs baseball club in 1948, joining other Hollywood stars Cecil B. DeMille, Robert Taylor, and Barbara Stanwyck who were also shareholders in the club. Crosby was also the honorary chairman of the club&#x27;s board of directors.

Crosby was also an avid golfer. He first took up golf at age 12 as a caddy. Crosby was already spending much time on the golf course while touring the country in a vaudeville act or with Paul Whiteman&#x27;s orchestra in the mid to late 1920s. Eventually, Crosby became accomplished at the sport, at his best reaching a two handicap. Crosby competed in both the British and U.S. Amateur championships, was a five-time club champion at Lakeside Golf Club in Hollywood, and once made a hole-in-one on the 16th hole at Cypress Point.

In 1937, Crosby hosted the first &#x27;Crosby Clambake&#x27;, a pro-am tournament at Rancho Santa Fe Golf Club in Rancho Santa Fe, California, the event&#x27;s location prior to World War II. After the war, the event resumed play in 1947 on golf courses in Pebble Beach, where it has been played ever since. Now the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, the tournament is a staple of the PGA Tour, having featured Hollywood stars and other celebrities.

In 1950, Crosby became the third person to win the William D. Richardson award, which is given to a non-professional golfer &quot;who has consistently made an outstanding contribution to golf&quot;. In 1978, he and Bob Hope were voted the Bob Jones Award, the highest honor given by the United States Golf Association in recognition of distinguished sportsmanship. Crosby is a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame, having been inducted in 1978.

Crosby also was a keen fisherman. In the summer of 1966, he spent a week as the guest of Lord Egremont, staying in Cockermouth and fishing on the River Derwent. Crosby&#x27;s trip was filmed for &quot;The American Sportsman&quot; on ABC, although all did not go well at first as the salmon were not running. He did make up for it at the end of the week by catching a number of sea trout.

In Front Royal, Virginia, a baseball stadium was named in Crosby&#x27;s honor. The Front Royal Cardinals of the Valley Baseball League play their home games here. The Bing is also home to both of the county&#x27;s high schools&#x27; baseball teams.

==Personal life==
Crosby reportedly had a problem with alcohol abuse between the late 1920s and early 1930s, spending 60 days in jail for drinking and crashing his car during prohibition. He got his drinking under control in 1931.

In 1977, Crosby told Barbara Walters in a televised interview that he thought marijuana should be legalized, because he believed it would make it much easier for the authorities to exert proper legal control over the market.

In December 1999, the New York Post published an article by Bill Hoffmann and Murray Weiss called &quot;Bing Crosby&#x27;s Single Life&quot; which claimed that &quot;recently published&quot; FBI files revealed connections with figures in the Mafia &quot;since his youth&quot;. However, Crosby&#x27;s FBI files had already been published in 1992 and provide no indication that Crosby had ties to the Mafia except for one major, but accidental encounter in Chicago in 1929 which is not mentioned in the files, but is told by Crosby himself in his as-told-to autobiography &quot;Call Me Lucky&quot;. In the over 280 pages of Crosby&#x27;s FBI files, there is only one reference to organized crime or gambling dens, the content of some of the many threats that Crosby received throughout his life.

The comments made by FBI investigators in the memos discredited the claims made in the letters. In the FBI files, there is only one reference to a person associated with the Mafia. In a memorandum dated January 16, 1959, it is said: &quot;The Salt Lake City Office has developed information indicating that Moe Dalitz received an invitation to join a deer hunting party at Bing Crosby&#x27;s Elko, Nevada, ranch, together with the crooner, his Las Vegas dentist and several business associates.&quot; However, Crosby had already sold his Elko ranch a year earlier, in 1958, and it is doubtful how much he was really involved in that meeting.

===Romantic relationships===
Crosby was married twice. His first wife was actress and nightclub singer Dixie Lee, to whom he was married from 1930 until she died of ovarian cancer in 1952. They had four sons: Gary, twins Dennis and Phillip, and Lindsay. &quot;Smash-Up: The Story of a Woman&quot; (1947) was rumored to be based on Lee&#x27;s life. The Crosby family lived at 10500 Camarillo Street in North Hollywood for more than five years.

After his wife died, Crosby had relationships with model Pat Sheehan, who married his son Dennis in 1958, and actresses Inger Stevens and Grace Kelly. Crosby married actress Kathryn Grant, who converted to Catholicism, in 1957. They had three children: Harry Lillis III, who played Bill in &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;, Mary Frances, best known for portraying Kristin Shepard on TV&#x27;s &quot;Dallas&quot;, and Nathaniel, the 1981 U.S. Amateur champion in golf.

Particularly during the late 1930s and the 1940s, Crosby&#x27;s domestic life was dominated by his wife&#x27;s excessive drinking. His efforts to cure her with the help of specialists failed. Tired of Dixie&#x27;s drinking, Crosby even asked her for a divorce in January 1941. During the 1940s, he consistently had difficulties trying to stay away from home, while also trying to be there as much as possible for his children.

Crosby had one confirmed extramarital affair between 1945 and the late 1940s, while married to his first wife Dixie. Actress Patricia Neal, who herself at the time was having an affair with the married Gary Cooper, wrote in her 1988 autobiography &quot;As I Am&quot; about a cruise to England with actress Joan Caulfield in 1948:

In the 2018 Crosby biography &quot;Bing Crosby: Swinging on a Star; the War Years, 1940–1946&quot;, there are excerpts from an original diary of two sisters, Violet and Mary Barsa, who, as young women, used to stalk Crosby in New York City in December 1945 and January 1946, and who detailed their observations in the diary. The document reveals that, during that time, Crosby was taking Caulfield out to dinner, visited theaters and opera houses with her, and Caulfield and a person in her company entered the Waldorf Hotel where Crosby was staying. The document also clearly indicates that at their meetings a third person, in most instances, Caulfield&#x27;s mother, was present. In 1954, Caulfield admitted to a relationship with a &quot;top film star&quot; who was a married man with children, who, in the end, chose his wife and children over her.

Caulfield&#x27;s sister, Betty Caulfield, confirmed the romantic relationship between Caulfield and Crosby. Despite being a Catholic, Crosby was seriously considering divorce in order to marry Caulfield. Either in December 1945 or January 1946, Crosby approached Cardinal Francis Spellman with his difficulties with dealing with his wife&#x27;s alcoholism, his love for Caulfield and his plan to file for divorce. According to Betty Caulfield, Spellman told Crosby: &quot;Bing, you are Father O&#x27;Malley and under no circumstances can Father O&#x27;Malley get a divorce.&quot; Around the same time, Crosby talked to his mother about his intentions and she protested. Ultimately, Crosby chose to end the relationship and to stay with his wife. Crosby and Dixie reconciled, and he continued trying to help her overcome her alcohol issues.

===Homes===
In November 1958, Crosby purchased the 1,350-acre Rising River Ranch in Cassel, California after renting a portion of it for several years. Attorney Ira Shadwell declined to disclose the purchase price. In October 1978, actor Clint Eastwood purchased the ranch under the name of his business manager, Roy Kaufman, for $1.5 million.

Crosby and his family lived in the San Francisco area for many years. In 1963, he and his wife Kathryn moved with their three young children from Los Angeles to a $175,000 ten-bedroom Tudor estate in Hillsborough, formerly owned by fellow horseman Lindsay C. Howard, one of Crosby&#x27;s closest friends, because they did not want to raise their children in Hollywood, according to son Nathaniel. This house went up for sale by its current owners in 2021 for $13.75 million.

In 1965, the Crosbys moved to a larger, 40-room French chateau-style house on nearby Jackling Drive, where Kathryn Crosby continued to reside after Bing&#x27;s death. This house served as a setting for some of the family&#x27;s Minute Maid orange juice television commercials.

===Children===
After Crosby&#x27;s death, his eldest son, Gary, published a highly critical memoir, &quot;Going My Own Way&quot; (1983; written in collaboration with noted music journalist Ross Firestone), depicting his father as cruel, cold, remote, and physically and psychologically abusive. While acknowledging that corporal punishments took place, there were reports of all of Gary&#x27;s immediate siblings distancing themselves from the abuse claims, either in public or in private.

Crosby&#x27;s younger son Phillip disputed his brother Gary&#x27;s claims about their father. Around the time Gary published his claims, Phillip stated to the press that &quot;Gary is a whining, bitching crybaby, walking around with a two-by-four on his shoulder and just daring people to nudge it off.&quot; Nevertheless, Phillip did not deny that Crosby believed in corporal punishment. In an interview with &quot;People&quot; magazine, Phillip stated that &quot;we never got an extra whack or a cuff we didn&#x27;t deserve&quot;.

Shortly before Gary&#x27;s book was actually published, Lindsay said, &quot;I&#x27;m glad [Gary] did it. I hope it clears up a lot of the old lies and rumors.&quot; Unlike Gary, Lindsay stated that he preferred to remember &quot;all the good things I did with my dad and forget the times that were rough&quot;. &quot;Lindsay Crosby supported his brother (Gary) at the time of its publication but had a tempered view of its revelations. &#x27;I never expected affection from my father so it didn&#x27;t bother me,&#x27; he once told an interviewer.&#x27;&quot; However, after the book was published, Lindsay addressed the abuse claims and what the media had made out of them:

Dennis Crosby reportedly &quot;said his older brother (Gary) was the most severely treated of the four boys. &#x27;He got the first licking, and we got the second.&#x27;&quot;

Gary&#x27;s first wife of 19 years, Barbara Cosentino, of whom Gary wrote in his book, &quot;I could confide in her about Mom and Dad and my childhood&quot;, and with whom Gary stayed friendly after the divorce, stated:

Gary Crosby&#x27;s adopted son, Steven Crosby, said in a 2003 interview:

Bing&#x27;s younger brother, singer and jazz bandleader Bob Crosby, recalled at the time of Gary&#x27;s revelations that Bing was a &quot;disciplinarian&quot;, as their mother and father had been. He added, &quot;We were brought up that way.&quot; In an interview for the same article, Gary clarified that Bing &quot;was like a lot of fathers of that time. He was not out to be vicious, to beat children for his kicks.&quot;

The author of the 2018 biography on Bing Crosby, Gary Giddins, claims that Gary Crosby&#x27;s memoir is not reliable on many instances and cannot be trusted on the abuse stories.

Crosby&#x27;s will established a blind trust in which none of the sons received an inheritance until they reached the age of 65, intended by Crosby to keep them out of trouble. They instead received several thousand dollars per month from a trust left in 1952 by their mother, Dixie Lee. The trust, tied to high-performing oil stocks, folded in December 1989 following the 1980s oil glut.

Lindsay Crosby died in 1989 at age 51, and Dennis Crosby died in 1991 at age 56, both by suicide from self-inflicted gunshot wounds. Gary Crosby died of lung cancer in 1995 at age 62. Phillip Crosby died of a heart attack in 2004 at age 69.

Nathaniel Crosby, Crosby&#x27;s younger son from his second marriage, is a former high-level golfer who won the U.S. Amateur in 1981 at age 19, becoming the youngest winner in the history of that event at the time. Harry Crosby is an investment banker who occasionally makes singing appearances.

Denise Crosby, Dennis Crosby&#x27;s daughter, is an actress and is known for her role as Tasha Yar on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. She appeared in the 1989 film adaptation of Stephen King&#x27;s novel &quot;Pet Sematary&quot;.

In 2006, Crosby&#x27;s niece through his sister Mary Rose, Carolyn Schneider, published the laudatory book &quot;Me and Uncle Bing&quot;.

Disputes between Crosby&#x27;s two families began in the late 1990s. When Dixie died in 1952, her will provided that her share of the community property be distributed in trust to her sons. After Crosby&#x27;s death in 1977, he left the residue of his estate to a marital trust for the benefit of his widow, Kathryn, and HLC Properties, Ltd., was formed for the purpose of managing his interests, including his right of publicity. In 1996, Dixie&#x27;s trust sued HLC and Kathryn for declaratory relief as to the trust&#x27;s entitlement to interest, dividends, royalties, and other income derived from the community property of Crosby and Dixie.

In 1999, the parties settled for approximately $1.5 million. Relying on a retroactive amendment to the California Civil Code, Dixie&#x27;s trust brought suit again, in 2010, alleging that Crosby&#x27;s right of publicity was community property, and that Dixie&#x27;s trust was entitled to a share of the revenue it produced. The trial court granted Dixie&#x27;s trust&#x27;s claim. The California Court of Appeals reversed it, holding that the 1999 settlement barred the claim. In light of the court&#x27;s ruling, it was unnecessary for the court to decide whether a right of publicity can be characterized as community property under California law.

==Health and death==
Following his recovery from a life-threatening fungal infection in his right lung in January 1974, Crosby emerged from semi-retirement to start a new spate of albums and concerts. On March 20, 1977, after videotaping a CBS concert special, &quot;Bing – 50th Anniversary Gala&quot;, at the Ambassador Auditorium with Bob Hope looking on, Crosby fell off the stage into an orchestra pit, rupturing a disc in his back requiring a month-long stay in the hospital. Crosby&#x27;s first performance after the accident was his last American concert, on August 16, 1977, the day Elvis Presley died, at the Concord Pavilion in Concord, California. When the electric power failed during his performance, Crosby continued singing without amplification. On August 27, Crosby gave a televised concert in Norway.

In September, Crosby, his family and singer Rosemary Clooney began a concert tour of Britain that included two weeks at the London Palladium. While in the UK, Crosby recorded his final album, &quot;Seasons&quot;, and his final TV Christmas special with guest David Bowie on September 11, which aired a little over a month after Crosby&#x27;s death. Crosby&#x27;s last concert was in the Brighton Centre on October 10, four days before his death, with British entertainer Gracie Fields in attendance. The following day, Crosby made his final appearance in a recording studio and sang eight songs at the BBC&#x27;s Maida Vale Studios for a radio program, which included an interview with Alan Dell. Accompanied by the Gordon Rose Orchestra, Crosby&#x27;s last recorded performance was of the song &quot;Once in a While&quot;. Later that afternoon, he met with Chris Harding to take photographs for the &quot;Seasons&quot; album jacket.

On October 13, 1977, Crosby flew alone to Spain to play golf and hunt partridge. The next day, Crosby played 18 holes of golf at the La Moraleja Golf Course near Madrid. His partner was World Cup champion Manuel Piñero. Their opponents were club president César de Zulueta and Valentín Barrios. According to Barrios, Crosby was in good spirits throughout the day, and was photographed several times during the round. At the ninth hole, construction workers building a house nearby recognized Crosby, and when asked for a song, Crosby sang &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot;. Crosby, who had a 13 handicap, won with his partner by one stroke.

As Crosby and his party headed back to the clubhouse at around 6:30 p.m., Crosby said, &quot;That was a great game of golf, fellas. Let&#x27;s go have a Coca-Cola.&quot; Those were his last words. About from the clubhouse entrance, Crosby collapsed and died instantly from a massive heart attack. At the clubhouse and later in the ambulance, house physician Dr. Laiseca tried to revive him, but was unsuccessful. At Reina Victoria Hospital, Crosby was administered the last rites of the Catholic Church and was pronounced dead at the age of 74.

On October 18, 1977, following a private funeral Mass at St. Paul the Apostle Catholic Church in Westwood, Los Angeles, Crosby was buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California.

==Legacy==
Crosby is a member of the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame in the radio division.

The family created an official website on October 14, 2007, the 30th anniversary of Crosby&#x27;s death.

In his autobiography &quot;Don&#x27;t Shoot, It&#x27;s Only Me!&quot; (1990), Bob Hope wrote, &quot;Dear old Bing, as we called him, the &quot;Economy-sized Sinatra&quot;. And what a voice. God I miss that voice. I can&#x27;t even turn on the radio around Christmas time without crying anymore.&quot;

Calypso musician Roaring Lion wrote a tribute song in 1939 titled &quot;Bing Crosby&quot;, in which he wrote: &quot;Bing has a way of singing with his very heart and soul / Which captivates the world / His millions of listeners never fail to rejoice / At his golden voice...&quot;

Bing Crosby Stadium in Front Royal, Virginia, was named after Crosby in honor of his fundraising and cash contributions for its construction from 1948 to 1950.

In 2006, the former Metropolitan Theater of Performing Arts (&#x27;The Met&#x27;) in Spokane, Washington, was renamed to The Bing Crosby Theater.

Crosby has three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. One each for radio, recording, and motion pictures.

==Compositions==
Crosby wrote or co-wrote lyrics to 22 songs. His composition &quot;At Your Command&quot; was number 1 for three weeks on the U.S. pop singles chart beginning on August 8, 1931. &quot;I Don&#x27;t Stand a Ghost of a Chance With You&quot; was his most successful composition, recorded by Duke Ellington, Frank Sinatra, Thelonious Monk, Billie Holiday, and Mildred Bailey, among others.

<doc id="4012" wikidata="Q775865" url="?curid=4012" title="Basel Convention">
<text>The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal, usually known as the Basel Convention, is an international treaty that was designed to reduce the movements of hazardous waste between nations, and specifically to restrict the transfer of hazardous waste from developed to less developed countries. It does not address the movement of radioactive waste, controlled by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The Basel Convention is also intended to minimize the rate and toxicity of wastes generated, to ensure their environmentally sound management as closely as possible to the source of generation, and to assist developing countries in environmentally sound management of the hazardous and other wastes they generate.
The convention was opened for signature on 21 March 1989, and entered into force on 5 May 1992. As of June 2024, there are 191 parties to the convention. In addition, Haiti and the United States have signed the convention but did not ratify it.

Following a petition urging action on the issue signed by more than a million people around the world, most of the world&#x27;s countries, but not the United States, agreed in May 2019 to an amendment of the Basel Convention to include plastic waste as regulated material. Although the United States is not a party to the treaty, export shipments of plastic waste from the United States are now &quot;criminal traffic as soon as the ships get on the high seas,&quot; according to the Basel Action Network (BAN), and carriers of such shipments may face liability, because the transportation of plastic waste is prohibited in just about every other country.

==History==
With the tightening of environmental laws (for example, RCRA) in developed nations in the 1970s, disposal costs for hazardous waste rose dramatically. At the same time, the globalization of shipping made cross-border movement of waste easier, and many less developed countries were desperate for foreign currency. Consequently, the trade in hazardous waste, particularly to poorer countries, grew rapidly. In 1990, OECD countries exported around 1.8 million tons of hazardous waste. Although most of this waste was shipped to other developed countries, a number of high-profile incidents of hazardous waste-dumping led to calls for regulation.

One of the incidents which led to the creation of the Basel Convention was the &quot;Khian Sea&quot; waste disposal incident, in which a ship carrying incinerator ash from the city of Philadelphia in the United States dumped half of its load on a beach in Haiti before being forced away. It sailed for many months, changing its name several times. Unable to unload the cargo in any port, the crew was believed to have dumped much of it at sea.

Another incident was a 1988 case in which five ships transported 8,000 barrels of hazardous waste from Italy to the small Nigerian town of Koko in exchange for $100 monthly rent which was paid to a Nigerian for the use of his farmland.

At its meeting that took place from 27 November to 1 December 2006, the parties of the Basel Agreement focused on issues of electronic waste and the dismantling of ships.

Increased trade in recyclable materials has led to an increase in a market for used products such as computers. This market is valued in billions of dollars. At issue is the distinction when used computers stop being a &quot;commodity&quot; and become a &quot;waste&quot;.

As of June 2023, there are 191 parties to the treaty, which includes 188 UN member states, the Cook Islands, the European Union, and the State of Palestine. The five UN member states that are not party to the treaty are East Timor, Fiji, Haiti, South Sudan, and United States.

==Definition of &quot;hazardous waste&quot;==

Waste falls under the scope of the convention if it is within the category of wastes listed in Annex I of the convention and it exhibits one of the hazardous characteristics contained in Annex III.
In other words, it must both be listed and possess a characteristic such as being explosive, flammable, toxic, or corrosive. The other way that a waste may fall under the scope of the convention is if it is defined as or considered to be a hazardous waste under the laws of either the exporting country, the importing country, or any of the countries of transit.

The definition of the term disposal is made in Article 2 al 4 and just refers to annex IV, which gives a list of operations which are understood as disposal or recovery. Examples of disposal are broad, including recovery and recycling.

Alternatively, to fall under the scope of the convention, it is sufficient for waste to be included in Annex II, which lists other wastes, such as household wastes and residue that comes from incinerating household waste.

Radioactive waste that is covered under other international control systems and wastes from the normal operation of ships are not covered.

Annex IX attempts to define wastes which are not considered hazardous wastes and which would be excluded from the scope of the Basel Convention. If these wastes however are contaminated with hazardous materials to an extent causing them to exhibit an Annex III characteristic, they are not excluded.

==Obligations==
In addition to conditions on the import and export of the above wastes, there are stringent requirements for notice, consent and tracking for movement of wastes across national boundaries. The convention places a general prohibition on the exportation or importation of wastes between parties and non-parties. The exception to this rule is where the waste is subject to another treaty that does not take away from the Basel Convention. The United States is a notable non-party to the convention and has a number of such agreements for allowing the shipping of hazardous wastes to Basel Party countries.

The OECD Council also has its own control system that governs the transboundary movement of hazardous materials between OECD member countries. This allows, among other things, the OECD countries to continue trading in wastes with countries like the United States that have not ratified the Basel Convention.

Parties to the convention must honor import bans of other parties.

Article 4 of the Basel Convention calls for an overall reduction of waste generation. By encouraging countries to keep wastes within their boundaries and as close as possible to its source of generation, the internal pressures should provide incentives for waste reduction and pollution prevention. Parties are generally prohibited from exporting covered wastes to, or importing covered waste from, non-parties to the convention.

The convention states that illegal hazardous waste traffic is criminal but contains no enforcement provisions.

According to Article 12, parties are directed to adopt a protocol that establishes liability rules and procedures that are appropriate for damage that comes from the movement of hazardous waste across borders.

The current consensus is that as space is not classed as a &quot;country&quot; under the specific definition, export of e-waste to non-terrestrial locations would not be covered.

==Basel Ban Amendment==
After the initial adoption of the convention, some least developed countries and environmental organizations argued that it did not go far enough. Many nations and NGOs argued for a total ban on shipment of all hazardous waste to developing countries. In particular, the original convention did not prohibit waste exports to any location except Antarctica but merely required a notification and consent system known as &quot;prior informed consent&quot; or PIC. Further, many waste traders sought to exploit the good name of recycling and begin to justify all exports as moving to recycling destinations. Many believed a full ban was needed including exports for recycling. These concerns led to several regional waste trade bans, including the Bamako Convention.

Lobbying at 1995 Basel conference by developing countries, Greenpeace and several European countries such as Denmark, led to the adoption of an amendment to the convention in 1995 termed the Basel Ban Amendment to the Basel Convention. The amendment has been accepted by 86 countries and the European Union, but has not entered into force (as that requires ratification by three-fourths of the member states to the convention). On 6 September 2019, Croatia became the 97th country to ratify the amendment which will enter into force after 90 days on 5 December 2019. The amendment prohibits the export of hazardous waste from a list of developed (mostly OECD) countries to developing countries. The Basel Ban applies to export for any reason, including recycling. An area of special concern for advocates of the amendment was the sale of ships for salvage, shipbreaking. The Ban Amendment was strenuously opposed by a number of industry groups as well as nations including Australia and Canada. The number of ratification for the entry-into force of the Ban Amendment is under debate: Amendments to the convention enter into force after ratification of &quot;three-fourths of the Parties who accepted them&quot; [Art. 17.5]; so far, the parties of the Basel Convention could not yet agree whether this would be three-fourths of the parties that were party to the Basel Convention when the ban was adopted, or three-fourths of the current parties of the convention [see Report of COP 9 of the Basel Convention]. The status of the amendment ratifications can be found on the Basel Secretariat&#x27;s web page. The European Union fully implemented the Basel Ban in its Waste Shipment Regulation (EWSR), making it legally binding in all EU member states. Norway and Switzerland have similarly fully implemented the Basel Ban in their legislation.

In the light of the blockage concerning the entry into force of the Ban Amendment, Switzerland and Indonesia have launched a &quot;Country-led Initiative&quot; (CLI) to discuss in an informal manner a way forward to ensure that the trans boundary movements of hazardous wastes, especially to developing countries and countries with economies in the transition, do not lead to an unsound management of hazardous wastes. This discussion aims at identifying and finding solutions to the reasons why hazardous wastes are still brought to countries that are not able to treat them in a safe manner. It is hoped that the CLI will contribute to the realization of the objectives of the Ban Amendment. The Basel Convention&#x27;s website informs about the progress of this initiative.

==Regulation of plastic waste==
In the wake of popular outcry, in May 2019 most of the world&#x27;s countries, but not the United States, agreed to amend the Basel Convention to include plastic waste as a regulated material. The world&#x27;s oceans are estimated to contain 100 million metric tons of plastic, with up to 90% of this quantity originating in land-based sources. The United States, which produces an annual 42 million metric tons of plastic waste, more than any other country in the world, opposed the amendment, but since it is not a party to the treaty it did not have an opportunity to vote on it to try to block it. Information about, and visual images of, wildlife, such as seabirds, ingesting plastic, and scientific findings that nanoparticles do penetrate through the blood–brain barrier were reported to have fueled public sentiment for coordinated international legally binding action. Over a million people worldwide signed a petition demanding official action. Although the United States is not a party to the treaty, export shipments of plastic waste from the United States are now &quot;criminal traffic as soon as the ships get on the high seas,&quot; according to the Basel Action Network (BAN), and carriers of such shipments may face liability, because the Basel Convention as amended in May 2019 prohibits the transportation of plastic waste to just about every other country.

The Basel Convention contains three main entries on plastic wastes in Annex II, VIII and IX of the Convention. The Plastic Waste Amendments of the convention are now binding on 186 States. In addition to ensuring the trade in plastic waste is more transparent and better regulated, under the Basel Convention governments must take steps not only to ensure the environmentally sound management of plastic waste, but also to tackle plastic waste at its source.

==Basel watchdog==
The Basel Action Network (BAN) is a charitable civil society non-governmental organization that works as a consumer watchdog for implementation of the Basel Convention. BAN&#x27;s principal aims is fighting exportation of toxic waste, including plastic waste, from industrialized societies to developing countries. BAN is based in Seattle, Washington, United States, with a partner office in the Philippines. BAN works to curb trans-border trade in hazardous electronic waste, land dumping, incineration, and the use of prison labor.

<doc id="4013" wikidata="Q4857943" url="?curid=4013" title="Bar Kokhba (album)">
<text>Bar Kokhba is a double album by John Zorn, recorded between 1994 and 1996. It features music from Zorn&#x27;s &quot;Masada&quot; project, rearranged for small ensembles. It also features the original soundtrack from &quot;The Art of Remembrance – Simon Wiesenthal&quot;, a film by Hannah Heer and Werner Schmiedel (1994–95).

== Reception ==
The AllMusic review by Marc Gilman noted: &quot;While some compositions retain their original structure and sound, some are expanded and probed by Zorn&#x27;s arrangements, and resemble avant-garde classical music more than jazz. But this is the beauty of the album; the ensembles provide a forum for Zorn to expand his compositions. The album consistently impresses.&quot;

<doc id="4015" wikidata="Q42979" url="?curid=4015" title="BASIC">
<text>BASIC (Beginners&#x27; All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) is a family of general-purpose, high-level programming languages designed for ease of use. The original version was created by John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz at Dartmouth College in 1963. They wanted to enable students in non-scientific fields to use computers. At the time, nearly all computers required writing custom software, which only scientists and mathematicians tended to learn.

In addition to the programming language, Kemeny and Kurtz developed the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System (DTSS), which allowed multiple users to edit and run BASIC programs simultaneously on remote terminals. This general model became popular on minicomputer systems like the PDP-11 and Data General Nova in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Hewlett-Packard produced an entire computer line for this method of operation, introducing the HP2000 series in the late 1960s and continuing sales into the 1980s. Many early video games trace their history to one of these versions of BASIC.

The emergence of microcomputers in the mid-1970s led to the development of multiple BASIC dialects, including Microsoft BASIC in 1975. Due to the tiny main memory available on these machines, often 4 KB, a variety of Tiny BASIC dialects were also created. BASIC was available for almost any system of the era, and became the &quot;de facto&quot; programming language for home computer systems that emerged in the late 1970s. These PCs almost always had a BASIC interpreter installed by default, often in the machine&#x27;s firmware or sometimes on a ROM cartridge.

BASIC declined in popularity in the 1990s, as more powerful microcomputers came to market and programming languages with advanced features (such as Pascal and C) became tenable on such computers. By then, most nontechnical personal computer users relied on pre-written applications rather than writing their own programs. In 1991, Microsoft released Visual Basic, combining an updated version of BASIC with a visual forms builder. This reignited use of the language and &quot;VB&quot; remains a major programming language in the form of VB.NET, while a hobbyist scene for BASIC more broadly continues to exist.

== Origin ==
John G. Kemeny was the chairman of the Dartmouth College Mathematics Department. Based largely on his reputation as an innovator in math teaching, in 1959 the college won an Alfred P. Sloan Foundation award for $500,000 to build a new department building. Thomas E. Kurtz had joined the department in 1956, and from the 1960s Kemeny and Kurtz agreed on the need for programming literacy among students outside the traditional STEM fields. Kemeny later noted that &quot;Our vision was that every student on campus should have access to a computer, and any faculty member should be able to use a computer in the classroom whenever appropriate. It was as simple as that.&quot;

Kemeny and Kurtz had made two previous experiments with simplified languages, DARSIMCO (Dartmouth Simplified Code) and DOPE (Dartmouth Oversimplified Programming Experiment). These did not progress past a single freshman class. New experiments using Fortran and ALGOL followed, but Kurtz concluded these languages were too tricky for what they desired. As Kurtz noted, Fortran had numerous oddly formed commands, notably an &quot;almost impossible-to-memorize convention for specifying a loop: . Is it &#x27;1, 10, 2&#x27; or &#x27;1, 2, 10&#x27;, and is the comma after the line number required or not?&quot;

Moreover, the lack of any sort of immediate feedback was a key problem; the machines of the era used batch processing and took a long time to complete a run of a program. While Kurtz was visiting MIT, John McCarthy suggested that time-sharing offered a solution; a single machine could divide up its processing time among many users, giving them the illusion of having a (slow) computer to themselves. Small programs would return results in a few seconds. This led to increasing interest in a system using time-sharing and a new language specifically for use by non-STEM students.

Kemeny wrote the first version of BASIC. The acronym &quot;BASIC&quot; comes from the name of an unpublished paper by Thomas Kurtz. The new language was heavily patterned on FORTRAN II; statements were one-to-a-line, numbers were used to indicate the target of loops and branches, and many of the commands were similar or identical to Fortran. However, the syntax was changed wherever it could be improved. For instance, the difficult to remember codice_1 loop was replaced by the much easier to remember , and the line number used in the DO was instead indicated by the codice_2. Likewise, the cryptic codice_3 statement of Fortran, whose syntax matched a particular instruction of the machine on which it was originally written, became the simpler . These changes made the language much less idiosyncratic while still having an overall structure and feel similar to the original FORTRAN.

The project received a $300,000 grant from the National Science Foundation, which was used to purchase a GE-225 computer for processing, and a Datanet-30 realtime processor to handle the Teletype Model 33 teleprinters used for input and output. A team of a dozen undergraduates worked on the project for about a year, writing both the DTSS system and the BASIC compiler. The first version BASIC language was released on 1 May 1964.

Initially, BASIC concentrated on supporting straightforward mathematical work, with matrix arithmetic support from its initial implementation as a batch language, and character string functionality being added by 1965. Usage in the university rapidly expanded, requiring the main CPU to be replaced by a GE-235, and still later by a GE-635. By the early 1970s there were hundreds of terminals connected to the machines at Dartmouth, some of them remotely.

Wanting use of the language to become widespread, its designers made the compiler available free of charge. In the 1960s, software became a chargeable commodity; until then, it was provided without charge as a service with expensive computers, usually available only to lease. They also made it available to high schools in the Hanover, New Hampshire, area and regionally throughout New England on Teletype Model 33 and Model 35 teleprinter terminals connected to Dartmouth via dial-up phone lines, and they put considerable effort into promoting the language. In the following years, as other dialects of BASIC appeared, Kemeny and Kurtz&#x27;s original BASIC dialect became known as &quot;Dartmouth BASIC&quot;.

New Hampshire recognized the accomplishment in 2019 when it erected a highway historical marker in Hanover describing the creation of &quot;the first user-friendly programming language&quot;.

== Spread on time-sharing services ==
The emergence of BASIC took place as part of a wider movement toward time-sharing systems. First conceptualized during the late 1950s, the idea became so dominant in the computer industry by the early 1960s that its proponents were speaking of a future in which users would &quot;buy time on the computer much the same way that the average household buys power and water from utility companies&quot;.

General Electric, having worked on the Dartmouth project, wrote their own underlying operating system and launched an online time-sharing system known as Mark I. It featured BASIC as one of its primary selling points. Other companies in the emerging field quickly followed suit; Tymshare introduced SUPER BASIC in 1968, CompuServe had a version on the DEC-10 at their launch in 1969, and by the early 1970s BASIC was largely universal on general-purpose mainframe computers. Even IBM eventually joined the club with the introduction of VS-BASIC in 1973.

Although time-sharing services with BASIC were successful for a time, the widespread success predicted earlier was not to be. The emergence of minicomputers during the same period, and especially low-cost microcomputers in the mid-1970s, allowed anyone to purchase and run their own systems rather than buy online time which was typically billed at dollars per minute.

== Spread on minicomputers ==
BASIC, by its very nature of being small, was naturally suited to porting to the minicomputer market, which was emerging at the same time as the time-sharing services. These machines had small main memory, perhaps as little as 4 KB in modern terminology, and lacked high-performance storage like hard drives that make compilers practical. On these systems, BASIC was normally implemented as an interpreter rather than a compiler due to its lower requirement for working memory.

A particularly important example was HP Time-Shared BASIC, which, like the original Dartmouth system, used two computers working together to implement a time-sharing system. The first, a low-end machine in the HP 2100 series, was used to control user input and save and load their programs to tape or disk. The other, a high-end version of the same underlying machine, ran the programs and generated output. For a cost of about $100,000, one could own a machine capable of running between 16 and 32 users at the same time. The system, bundled as the HP 2000, was the first mini platform to offer time-sharing and was an immediate runaway success, catapulting HP to become the third-largest vendor in the minicomputer space, behind DEC and Data General (DG).

DEC, the leader in the minicomputer space since the mid-1960s, had initially ignored BASIC. This was due to their work with RAND Corporation, who had purchased a PDP-6 to run their JOSS language, which was conceptually very similar to BASIC. This led DEC to introduce a smaller, cleaned up version of JOSS known as FOCAL, which they heavily promoted in the late 1960s. However, with timesharing systems widely offering BASIC, and all of their competition in the minicomputer space doing the same, DEC&#x27;s customers were clamoring for BASIC. After management repeatedly ignored their pleas, David H. Ahl took it upon himself to buy a BASIC for the PDP-8, which was a major success in the education market. By the early 1970s, FOCAL and JOSS had been forgotten and BASIC had become almost universal in the minicomputer market. DEC would go on to introduce their updated version, BASIC-PLUS, for use on the RSTS/E time-sharing operating system.

During this period a number of simple text-based games were written in BASIC, most notably Mike Mayfield&#x27;s &quot;Star Trek&quot;. David Ahl collected these, some ported from FOCAL, and published them in an educational newsletter he compiled. He later collected a number of these into book form, &quot;101 BASIC Computer Games&quot;, published in 1973. During the same period, Ahl was involved in the creation of a small computer for education use, an early personal computer. When management refused to support the concept, Ahl left DEC in 1974 to found the seminal computer magazine, &quot;Creative Computing&quot;. The book remained popular, and was re-published on several occasions.

== Explosive growth: the home computer era ==

The introduction of the first microcomputers in the mid-1970s was the start of explosive growth for BASIC. It had the advantage that it was fairly well known to the young designers and computer hobbyists who took an interest in microcomputers, many of whom had seen BASIC on minis or mainframes. Despite Dijkstra&#x27;s famous judgement in 1975, &quot;It is practically impossible to teach good programming to students that have had a prior exposure to BASIC: as potential programmers they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration&quot;, BASIC was one of the few languages that was both high-level enough to be usable by those without training and small enough to fit into the microcomputers of the day, making it the &quot;de facto&quot; standard programming language on early microcomputers.

The first microcomputer version of BASIC was co-written by Bill Gates, Paul Allen and Monte Davidoff for their newly formed company, Micro-Soft. This was released by MITS in punch tape format for the Altair 8800 shortly after the machine itself, immediately cementing BASIC as the primary language of early microcomputers. Members of the Homebrew Computer Club began circulating copies of the program, causing Gates to write his Open Letter to Hobbyists, complaining about this early example of software piracy.

Partially in response to Gates&#x27;s letter, and partially to make an even smaller BASIC that would run usefully on 4 KB machines, Bob Albrecht urged Dennis Allison to write their own variation of the language. How to design and implement a stripped-down version of an interpreter for the BASIC language was covered in articles by Allison in the first three quarterly issues of the &quot;People&#x27;s Computer Company&quot; newsletter published in 1975 and implementations with source code published in &quot;Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Journal of Tiny BASIC Calisthenics &amp; Orthodontia: Running Light Without Overbyte&quot;. This led to a wide variety of Tiny BASICs with added features or other improvements, with versions from Tom Pittman and Li-Chen Wang becoming particularly well known.

Micro-Soft, by this time Microsoft, ported their interpreter for the MOS 6502, which quickly become one of the most popular microprocessors of the 8-bit era. When new microcomputers began to appear, notably the &quot;1977 trinity&quot; of the TRS-80, Commodore PET and Apple II, they either included a version of the MS code, or quickly introduced new models with it. Ohio Scientific&#x27;s personal computers also joined this trend at that time. By 1978, MS BASIC was a &quot;de facto&quot; standard and practically every home computer of the 1980s included it in ROM. Upon boot, a BASIC interpreter in direct mode was presented.

Commodore Business Machines includes Commodore BASIC, based on Microsoft BASIC. The Apple II and TRS-80 each have two versions of BASIC: a smaller introductory version with the initial releases of the machines and a Microsoft-based version introduced as interest in the platforms increased. As new companies entered the field, additional versions were added that subtly changed the BASIC family. The Atari 8-bit computers use the 8 KB Atari BASIC which is not derived from Microsoft BASIC. Sinclair BASIC was introduced in 1980 with the Sinclair ZX80, and was later extended for the Sinclair ZX81 and the Sinclair ZX Spectrum. The BBC published BBC BASIC, developed by Acorn Computers, incorporates extra structured programming keywords and floating-point features.

As the popularity of BASIC grew in this period, computer magazines published complete source code in BASIC for video games, utilities, and other programs. Given BASIC&#x27;s straightforward nature, it was a simple matter to type in the code from the magazine and execute the program. Different magazines were published featuring programs for specific computers, though some BASIC programs were considered universal and could be used in machines running any variant of BASIC (sometimes with minor adaptations). Many books of type-in programs were also available, and in particular, Ahl published versions of the original 101 BASIC games converted into the Microsoft dialect and published it from &quot;Creative Computing&quot; as &quot;BASIC Computer Games&quot;. This book, and its sequels, provided hundreds of ready-to-go programs that could be easily converted to practically any BASIC-running platform. The book reached the stores in 1978, just as the home computer market was starting off, and it became the first million-selling computer book. Later packages, such as Learn to Program BASIC would also have gaming as an introductory focus. On the business-focused CP/M computers which soon became widespread in small business environments, Microsoft BASIC (MBASIC) was one of the leading applications.

In 1978, David Lien published the first edition of &quot;The BASIC Handbook: An Encyclopedia of the BASIC Computer Language&quot;, documenting keywords across over 78 different computers. By 1981, the second edition documented keywords from over 250 different computers, showcasing the explosive growth of the microcomputer era.

== IBM PC and compatibles ==
When IBM was designing the IBM PC, they followed the paradigm of existing home computers in having a built-in BASIC interpreter. They sourced this from Microsoft – IBM Cassette BASIC – but Microsoft also produced several other versions of BASIC for MS-DOS/PC DOS including IBM Disk BASIC (BASIC D), IBM BASICA (BASIC A), GW-BASIC (a BASICA-compatible version that did not need IBM&#x27;s ROM) and QBasic, all typically bundled with the machine. In addition they produced the Microsoft QuickBASIC Compiler (1985) for power users and hobbyists, and the Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System (PDS) for professional programmers. Turbo Pascal-publisher Borland published Turbo Basic 1.0 in 1985 (successor versions were marketed under the name PowerBASIC).

On Unix-like systems, specialized implementations were created such as XBasic and X11-Basic. XBasic was ported to Microsoft Windows as XBLite, and cross-platform variants such as SmallBasic, yabasic, Bywater BASIC, nuBasic, MyBasic, Logic Basic, Liberty BASIC, and wxBasic emerged. FutureBASIC and Chipmunk Basic meanwhile targeted the Apple Macintosh, while yab is a version of yaBasic optimized for BeOS, ZETA and Haiku.

These later variations introduced many extensions, such as improved string manipulation and graphics support, access to the file system and additional data types. More important were the facilities for structured programming, including additional control structures and proper subroutines supporting local variables. The addition of an integrated development environment (IDE) and electronic Help files made the products easier to work with and supported learning tools and school curriculum.

In 1989, Microsoft Press published &quot;Learn BASIC Now&quot;, a book-and-software system designed to teach BASIC programming to self-taught learners who were using IBM-PC compatible systems and the Apple Macintosh. &quot;Learn BASIC Now&quot; included software disks containing the Microsoft QuickBASIC Interpreter and a programming tutorial written by Michael Halvorson and David Rygmyr. Learning systems like &quot;Learn BASIC Now&quot; popularized structured BASIC and helped QuickBASIC reach an installed base of four million active users.

By the late 1980s, many users were using pre-made applications written by others rather than learning programming themselves, and professional developers had a wide range of advanced languages available on small computers. C and later C++ became the languages of choice for professional &quot;shrink wrap&quot; application development.

A niche that BASIC continued to fill was for hobbyist video game development, as game creation systems and readily available game engines were still in their infancy. The Atari ST had STOS BASIC while the Amiga had AMOS BASIC for this purpose. Microsoft first exhibited BASIC for game development with DONKEY.BAS for GW-BASIC, and later GORILLA.BAS and NIBBLES.BAS for QuickBASIC. QBasic maintained an active game development community, which helped later spawn the QB64 and FreeBASIC implementations. An early example of this market is the QBasic software package Microsoft Game Shop (1990), a hobbyist-inspired release that included six &quot;arcade-style&quot; games that were easily customizable in QBasic.

In 2013, a game written in QBasic and compiled with QB64 for modern computers entitled &quot;Black Annex&quot; was released on Steam. Blitz Basic, Dark Basic, SdlBasic, Super Game System Basic, PlayBASIC, CoolBasic, AllegroBASIC, ethosBASIC, GLBasic and Basic4GL further filled this demand, right up to the modern RCBasic, NaaLaa, AppGameKit, Monkey 2, and Cerberus-X.

== Visual Basic ==

In 1991, Microsoft introduced Visual Basic, an evolutionary development of QuickBASIC. It included constructs from that language such as block-structured control statements, parameterized subroutines and optional static typing as well as object-oriented constructs from other languages such as &quot;With&quot; and &quot;For Each&quot;. The language retained some compatibility with its predecessors, such as the Dim keyword for declarations, &quot;Gosub&quot;/Return statements and optional line numbers which could be used to locate errors. An important driver for the development of Visual Basic was as the new macro language for Microsoft Excel, a spreadsheet program. To the surprise of many at Microsoft who still initially marketed it as a language for hobbyists, the language came into widespread use for small custom business applications shortly after the release of VB version 3.0, which is widely considered the first relatively stable version. Microsoft also spun it off as Visual Basic for Applications and Embedded Visual Basic.

While many advanced programmers still scoffed at its use, VB met the needs of small businesses efficiently as by that time, computers running Windows 3.1 had become fast enough that many business-related processes could be completed &quot;in the blink of an eye&quot; even using a &quot;slow&quot; language, as long as large amounts of data were not involved. Many small business owners found they could create their own small, yet useful applications in a few evenings to meet their own specialized needs. Eventually, during the lengthy lifetime of VB3, knowledge of Visual Basic had become a marketable job skill. Microsoft also produced VBScript in 1996 and Visual Basic .NET in 2001. The latter has essentially the same power as C# and Java but with syntax that reflects the original Basic language, and also features some cross-platform capability through implementations such as Mono-Basic. The IDE, with its event-driven GUI builder, was also influential on other rapid application development tools, most notably Borland Software&#x27;s Delphi for Object Pascal and its own descendants such as Lazarus.

Mainstream support for the final version 6.0 of the original Visual Basic ended on March 31, 2005, followed by extended support in March 2008. Owing to its persistent remaining popularity, third-party attempts to further support it exist. On February 2, 2017, Microsoft announced that development on VB.NET would no longer be in parallel with that of C#, and on March 11, 2020, it was announced that evolution of the VB.NET language had also concluded. Even so, the language was still supported.

== Post-1990 versions and dialects ==
Many other BASIC dialects have also sprung up since 1990, including the open source QB64 and FreeBASIC, inspired by QBasic, and the Visual Basic-styled RapidQ, HBasic, Basic For Qt and Gambas. Modern commercial incarnations include PureBasic, PowerBASIC, Xojo, Monkey X and True BASIC (the direct successor to Dartmouth BASIC from a company controlled by Kurtz).

Several web-based simple BASIC interpreters also now exist, including Microsoft&#x27;s Small Basic and Google&#x27;s wwwBASIC. A number of compilers also exist that convert BASIC into JavaScript. such as NS Basic.Building from earlier efforts such as Mobile Basic, many dialects are now available for smartphones and tablets.

On game consoles, an application for the Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo DSi called &quot;Petit Computer&quot; allows for programming in a slightly modified version of BASIC with DS button support. A version has also been released for Nintendo Switch, which has also been supplied a version of the Fuze Code System, a BASIC variant first implemented as a custom Raspberry Pi machine. Previously BASIC was made available on consoles as Family BASIC (for the Nintendo Famicom) and PSX Chipmunk Basic (for the original PlayStation), while yabasic was ported to the PlayStation 2 and FreeBASIC to the original Xbox.

== Calculators ==
Variants of BASIC are available on graphing and otherwise programmable calculators made by Texas Instruments (TI-BASIC), HP (HP BASIC), Casio (Casio BASIC), and others.

== Windows command-line ==
QBasic, a version of Microsoft QuickBASIC without the linker to make EXE files, is present in the Windows NT and DOS-Windows 95 streams of operating systems and can be obtained for more recent releases like Windows 7 which do not have them. Prior to DOS 5, the Basic interpreter was GW-Basic. QuickBasic is part of a series of three languages issued by Microsoft for the home and office power user and small-scale professional development; QuickC and QuickPascal are the other two. For Windows 95 and 98, which do not have QBasic installed by default, they can be copied from the installation disc, which will have a set of directories for old and optional software; other missing commands like Exe2Bin and others are in these same directories.

== Other ==

The various Microsoft, Lotus, and Corel office suites and related products are programmable with Visual Basic in one form or another, including LotusScript, which is very similar to VBA 6. The Host Explorer terminal emulator uses WWB as a macro language; or more recently the programme and the suite in which it is contained is programmable in an in-house Basic variant known as Hummingbird Basic. The VBScript variant is used for programming web content, Outlook 97, Internet Explorer, and the Windows Script Host. WSH also has a Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) engine installed as the third of the default engines along with VBScript, JScript, and the numerous proprietary or open source engines which can be installed like PerlScript, a couple of Rexx-based engines, Python, Ruby, Tcl, Delphi, XLNT, PHP, and others; meaning that the two versions of Basic can be used along with the other mentioned languages, as well as LotusScript, in a WSF file, through the component object model, and other WSH and VBA constructions. VBScript is one of the languages that can be accessed by the 4Dos, 4NT, and Take Command enhanced shells. SaxBasic and WWB are also very similar to the Visual Basic line of Basic implementations. The pre-Office 97 macro language for Microsoft Word is known as WordBASIC. Excel 4 and 5 use Visual Basic itself as a macro language. Chipmunk Basic, an old-school interpreter similar to BASICs of the 1970s, is available for Linux, Microsoft Windows and macOS.

== Legacy ==
The ubiquity of BASIC interpreters on personal computers was such that textbooks once included simple &quot;Try It In BASIC&quot; exercises that encouraged students to experiment with mathematical and computational concepts on classroom or home computers. Popular computer magazines of the day typically included type-in programs.

Futurist and sci-fi writer David Brin mourned the loss of ubiquitous BASIC in a 2006 &quot;Salon&quot; article as have others who first used computers during this era. In turn, the article prompted Microsoft to develop and release Small Basic; it also inspired similar projects like Basic-256 and the web based Quite Basic. Dartmouth held a 50th anniversary celebration for BASIC on 1 May 2014. The pedagogical use of BASIC has been followed by other languages, such as Pascal, Java and particularly Python.

Dartmouth College celebrated the 50th anniversary of the BASIC language with a day of events on April 30, 2014. A short documentary film was produced for the event.

== Syntax ==
=== Typical BASIC keywords ===
==== Data manipulation ====
; codice_4 : assigns a value (which may be the result of an expression) to a variable. In most dialects of BASIC, codice_4 is optional, and a line with no other identifiable keyword will assume the keyword to be codice_4.
; codice_7 : holds a list of values which are assigned sequentially using the READ command.
; codice_8 : reads a value from a codice_7 statement and assigns it to a variable. An internal pointer keeps track of the last codice_7 element that was read and moves it one position forward with each codice_8. Most dialects allow multiple variables as parameters, reading several values in a single operation.
; codice_12 : resets the internal pointer to the first codice_7 statement, allowing the program to begin codice_8ing from the first value. Many dialects allow an optional line number or ordinal value to allow the pointer to be reset to a selected location.
; codice_15 : Sets up an array.

==== Program flow control ====
; codice_16 : used to perform comparisons or make decisions. Early dialects only allowed a line number after the codice_17, but later versions allowed any valid statement to follow. codice_18 was not widely supported, especially in earlier versions.
; codice_19 : repeat a section of code a given number of times. A variable that acts as a counter, the &quot;index&quot;, is available within the loop.
; codice_20 and codice_21 : repeat a section of code while the specified condition is true. The condition may be evaluated before each iteration of the loop, or after. Both of these commands are found mostly in later dialects.
; codice_22 or codice_23 : repeat a section of code indefinitely or while/until the specified condition is true. The condition may be evaluated before each iteration of the loop, or after. Similar to codice_24, these keywords are mostly found in later dialects.
; codice_25 : jumps to a numbered or labelled line in the program. Most dialects also allowed the form .
; codice_26 : jumps to a numbered or labelled line, executes the code it finds there until it reaches a codice_27 command, on which it jumps back to the statement following the codice_28, either after a colon, or on the next line. This is used to implement subroutines.
; codice_29 : chooses where to jump based on the specified conditions. See Switch statement for other forms.
; codice_30 : a pair of keywords introduced in the early 1960s to define functions. The original BASIC functions were modelled on FORTRAN single-line functions. BASIC functions were one expression with variable arguments, rather than subroutines, with a syntax on the model of codice_31 at the beginning of a program. Function names were originally restricted to FN, plus one letter, &quot;i.e.&quot;, FNA, FNB ...

==== Input and output ====
; codice_32 : displays the full source code of the current program.
; codice_33 : displays a message on the screen or other output device.
; codice_34 : asks the user to enter the value of a variable. The statement may include a prompt message.
; codice_35 : used with codice_33 to set the position where the next character will be shown on the screen or printed on paper. codice_37 is an alternative form.
; codice_38 : prints out a number of space characters. Similar in concept to codice_35 but moves by a number of additional spaces from the current column rather than moving to a specified column.

==== Mathematical functions ====
; codice_40 : Absolute value
; codice_41 : Arctangent (result in radians)
; codice_42 : Cosine (argument in radians)
; codice_43 : Exponential function
; codice_44 : Integer part (typically floor function)
; codice_45 : Natural logarithm
; codice_46 : Random number generation
; codice_47 : Sine (argument in radians)
; codice_48 : Square root
; codice_49 : Tangent (argument in radians)

==== Miscellaneous ====
; codice_50 : holds a programmer&#x27;s comment or REMark; often used to give a title to the program and to help identify the purpose of a given section of code.
; codice_51 (&quot;User Serviceable Routine&quot;): transfers program control to a machine language subroutine, usually entered as an alphanumeric string or in a list of DATA statements.
; codice_52 : alternative form of codice_51 found in some dialects. Does not require an artificial parameter to complete the function-like syntax of codice_51, and has a clearly defined method of calling different routines in memory.
; codice_55 / codice_56: turns on display of each line number as it is run (&quot;TRace ON&quot;). This was useful for debugging or correcting of problems in a program. TROFF turns it back off again.
; codice_57 : some compilers such as Freebasic, Purebasic, and Powerbasic also support inline assembly language, allowing the programmer to intermix high-level and low-level code, typically prefixed with &quot;ASM&quot; or &quot;!&quot; statements.

=== Data types and variables ===
Minimal versions of BASIC had only integer variables and one- or two-letter variable names, which minimized requirements of limited and expensive memory (RAM). More powerful versions had floating-point arithmetic, and variables could be labelled with names six or more characters long. There were some problems and restrictions in early implementations; for example, Applesoft BASIC allowed variable names to be several characters long, but only the first two were significant, thus it was possible to inadvertently write a program with variables &quot;LOSS&quot; and &quot;LOAN&quot;, which would be treated as being the same; assigning a value to &quot;LOAN&quot; would silently overwrite the value intended as &quot;LOSS&quot;. Keywords could not be used in variables in many early BASICs; &quot;SCORE&quot; would be interpreted as &quot;SC&quot; OR &quot;E&quot;, where OR was a keyword. String variables are usually distinguished in many microcomputer dialects by having $ suffixed to their name as a sigil, and values are often identified as strings by being delimited by &quot;double quotation marks&quot;. Arrays in BASIC could contain integers, floating point or string variables.

Some dialects of BASIC supported matrices and matrix operations, which can be used to solve sets of simultaneous linear algebraic equations. These dialects would directly support matrix operations such as assignment, addition, multiplication (of compatible matrix types), and evaluation of a determinant. Many microcomputer BASICs did not support this data type; matrix operations were still possible, but had to be programmed explicitly on array elements.

=== Examples ===
==== Unstructured BASIC ====
New BASIC programmers on a home computer might start with a simple program, perhaps using the language&#x27;s PRINT statement to display a message on the screen; a well-known and often-replicated example is Kernighan and Ritchie&#x27;s &quot;Hello, World!&quot; program:
10 PRINT &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
20 END
An infinite loop could be used to fill the display with the message:
10 PRINT &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
20 GOTO 10
Note that the codice_58 statement is optional and has no action in most dialects of BASIC. It was not always included, as is the case in this example. This same program can be modified to print a fixed number of messages using the common codice_59 statement:
10 LET N=10
20 FOR I=1 TO N
30 PRINT &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
40 NEXT I
Most home computers BASIC versions, such as MSX BASIC and GW-BASIC, supported simple data types, loop cycles, and arrays. The following example is written for GW-BASIC, but will work in most versions of BASIC with minimal changes:
10 INPUT &quot;What is your name: &quot;; U$
20 PRINT &quot;Hello &quot;; U$
30 INPUT &quot;How many stars do you want: &quot;; N
40 S$ = &quot;&quot;
50 FOR I = 1 TO N
60 S$ = S$ + &quot;*&quot;
70 NEXT I
80 PRINT S$
90 INPUT &quot;Do you want more stars? &quot;; A$
100 IF LEN(A$) = 0 THEN GOTO 90
110 A$ = LEFT$(A$, 1)
120 IF A$ = &quot;Y&quot; OR A$ = &quot;y&quot; THEN GOTO 30
130 PRINT &quot;Goodbye &quot;; U$
140 END

The resulting dialog might resemble:

 What is your name: Mike
 Hello Mike
 How many stars do you want: 7
 Do you want more stars? yes
 How many stars do you want: 3
 Do you want more stars? no
 Goodbye Mike

The original Dartmouth Basic was unusual in having a matrix keyword, MAT. Although not implemented by most later microprocessor derivatives, it is used in this example from the 1968 manual which averages the numbers that are input:
5 LET S = 0
10 MAT INPUT V 
20 LET N = NUM 
30 IF N = 0 THEN 99 
40 FOR I = 1 TO N 
45 LET S = S + V(I) 
50 NEXT I 
60 PRINT S/N 
70 GO TO 5 
99 END
==== Structured BASIC ====
Second-generation BASICs (for example, VAX Basic, SuperBASIC, True BASIC, QuickBASIC, BBC BASIC, Pick BASIC, PowerBASIC, Liberty BASIC, QB64 and (arguably) COMAL) introduced a number of features into the language, primarily related to structured and procedure-oriented programming. Usually, line numbering is omitted from the language and replaced with labels (for GOTO) and procedures to encourage easier and more flexible design. In addition keywords and structures to support repetition, selection and procedures with local variables were introduced.

The following example is in Microsoft QuickBASIC:
REM QuickBASIC example

REM Forward declaration - allows the main code to call a
REM subroutine that is defined later in the source code
DECLARE SUB PrintSomeStars (StarCount!)

REM Main program follows
INPUT &quot;What is your name: &quot;, UserName$
PRINT &quot;Hello &quot;; UserName$
DO
 INPUT &quot;How many stars do you want: &quot;, NumStars
 CALL PrintSomeStars(NumStars)
 DO
 INPUT &quot;Do you want more stars? &quot;, Answer$
 LOOP UNTIL Answer$ &lt;&gt; &quot;&quot;
 Answer$ = LEFT$(Answer$, 1)
LOOP WHILE UCASE$(Answer$) = &quot;Y&quot;
PRINT &quot;Goodbye &quot;; UserName$
END

REM subroutine definition
SUB PrintSomeStars (StarCount)
 REM This procedure uses a local variable called Stars$
 Stars$ = STRING$(StarCount, &quot;*&quot;)
 PRINT Stars$
END SUB
==== Object-oriented BASIC ====
Third-generation BASIC dialects such as Visual Basic, Xojo, Gambas, StarOffice Basic, BlitzMax and PureBasic introduced features to support object-oriented and event-driven programming paradigm. Most built-in procedures and functions are now represented as &quot;methods&quot; of standard objects rather than &quot;operators&quot;. Also, the operating system became increasingly accessible to the BASIC language.

The following example is in Visual Basic .NET:

Public Module StarsProgram
 Private Function Ask(prompt As String) As String
 Console.Write(prompt)
 Return Console.ReadLine()
 End Function

 Public Sub Main()
 Dim userName = Ask(&quot;What is your name: &quot;)
 Console.WriteLine(&quot;Hello {0}&quot;, userName)

 Dim answer As String

 Do
 Dim numStars = CInt(Ask(&quot;How many stars do you want: &quot;))
 Dim stars As New String(&quot;*&quot;c, numStars)
 Console.WriteLine(stars)

 Do
 answer = Ask(&quot;Do you want more stars? &quot;)
 Loop Until answer &lt;&gt; &quot;&quot;
 Loop While answer.StartsWith(&quot;Y&quot;, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)

 Console.WriteLine(&quot;Goodbye {0}&quot;, userName)
 End Sub
End Module

<doc id="4016" wikidata="Q128866" url="?curid=4016" title="List of Byzantine emperors">
<text>The foundation of Constantinople in 330 AD marks the conventional start of the Eastern Roman Empire, which fell to the Ottoman Empire in 1453 AD. Only the emperors who were recognized as legitimate rulers and exercised sovereign authority are included, to the exclusion of junior co-emperors who never attained the status of sole or senior ruler, as well as of the various usurpers or rebels who claimed the imperial title.

The following list starts with Constantine the Great, the first Christian emperor, who rebuilt the city of Byzantium as an imperial capital, Constantinople, and who was regarded by the later emperors as the model ruler. Modern historians distinguish this later phase of the Roman Empire as Byzantine due to the imperial seat moving from Rome to Byzantium, the Empire&#x27;s integration of Christianity, and the predominance of Greek instead of Latin.

The Byzantine Empire was the direct legal continuation of the eastern half of the Roman Empire following the division of the Roman Empire in 395. Emperors listed below up to Theodosius I in 395 were sole or joint rulers of the entire Roman Empire. The Western Roman Empire continued until 476. Byzantine emperors considered themselves to be Roman emperors in direct succession from Augustus; the term &quot;Byzantine&quot; became convention in Western historiography in the 19th century. The use of the title &quot;Roman Emperor&quot; by those ruling from Constantinople was not contested until after the papal coronation of the Frankish Charlemagne as Holy Roman emperor (25 December 800).

The title of all Emperors preceding Heraclius was officially &quot;&quot;Augustus&quot;, although other titles such as &quot;Dominus&quot; were also used. Their names were preceded by &quot;Imperator Caesar&quot; and followed by &quot;Augustus&quot;. Following Heraclius, the title commonly became the Greek &quot;Basileus&quot; (Gr. Βασιλεύς), which had formerly meant sovereign, though &quot;Augustus&quot; continued to be used in a reduced capacity. Following the establishment of the rival Holy Roman Empire in Western Europe, the title &quot;Autokrator&quot;&quot; (Gr. Αὐτοκράτωρ) was increasingly used. In later centuries, the Emperor could be referred to by Western Christians as the &quot;Emperor of the Greeks&quot;. Towards the end of the Empire, the standard imperial formula of the Byzantine ruler was &quot;[Emperor&#x27;s name] in Christ, Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans&quot; (cf. Ῥωμαῖοι and Rûm). 

Dynasties were a common tradition and structure for rulers and government systems in the Medieval period. The principle or formal requirement for hereditary succession was not a part of the Empire&#x27;s governance; hereditary succession was a custom and tradition, carried on as habit and benefited from some sense of legitimacy, but not as a &quot;rule&quot; or inviolable requirement for office at the time.

<doc id="4024" wikidata="Q187536" url="?curid=4024" title="Butterfly effect">
<text>In chaos theory, the butterfly effect is the sensitive dependence on initial conditions in which a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state.

The term is closely associated with the work of the mathematician and meteorologist Edward Norton Lorenz. He noted that the butterfly effect is derived from the example of the details of a tornado (the exact time of formation, the exact path taken) being influenced by minor perturbations such as a distant butterfly flapping its wings several weeks earlier. Lorenz originally used a seagull causing a storm but was persuaded to make it more poetic with the use of a butterfly and tornado by 1972. He discovered the effect when he observed runs of his weather model with initial condition data that were rounded in a seemingly inconsequential manner. He noted that the weather model would fail to reproduce the results of runs with the unrounded initial condition data. A very small change in initial conditions had created a significantly different outcome.

The idea that small causes may have large effects in weather was earlier acknowledged by the French mathematician and physicist Henri Poincaré. The American mathematician and philosopher Norbert Wiener also contributed to this theory. Lorenz&#x27;s work placed the concept of &quot;instability&quot; of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere onto a quantitative base and linked the concept of instability to the properties of large classes of dynamic systems which are undergoing nonlinear dynamics and deterministic chaos.

The concept of the butterfly effect has since been used outside the context of weather science as a broad term for any situation where a small change is supposed to be the cause of larger consequences.

==History==

In &quot;The Vocation of Man&quot; (1800), Johann Gottlieb Fichte says &quot;you could not remove a single grain of sand from its place without thereby ... changing something throughout all parts of the immeasurable whole&quot;.

Chaos theory and the sensitive dependence on initial conditions were described in numerous forms of literature. This is evidenced by the case of the three-body problem by Poincaré in 1890. He later proposed that such phenomena could be common, for example, in meteorology.

In 1898, Jacques Hadamard noted general divergence of trajectories in spaces of negative curvature. Pierre Duhem discussed the possible general significance of this in 1908.

In 1950, Alan Turing noted: &quot;The displacement of a single electron by a billionth of a centimetre at one moment might make the difference between a man being killed by an avalanche a year later, or escaping.&quot;

The idea that the death of one butterfly could eventually have a far-reaching ripple effect on subsequent historical events made its earliest known appearance in &quot;A Sound of Thunder&quot;, a 1952 short story by Ray Bradbury. &quot;A Sound of Thunder&quot; features time travel.

More precisely, though, almost the exact idea and the exact phrasing —of a tiny insect&#x27;s wing affecting the entire atmosphere&#x27;s winds— was published in a children&#x27;s book which became extremely successful and well-known globally in 1962, the year before Lorenz published:
In 1961, Lorenz was running a numerical computer model to redo a weather prediction from the middle of the previous run as a shortcut. He entered the initial condition 0.506 from the printout instead of entering the full precision 0.506127 value. The result was a completely different weather scenario.

Lorenz wrote:

In 1963, Lorenz published a theoretical study of this effect in a highly cited, seminal paper called &quot;Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow&quot; (the calculations were performed on a Royal McBee LGP-30 computer). Elsewhere he stated:
Following proposals from colleagues, in later speeches and papers, Lorenz used the more poetic butterfly. According to Lorenz, when he failed to provide a title for a talk he was to present at the 139th meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1972, Philip Merilees concocted &quot;Does the flap of a butterfly&#x27;s wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?&quot; as a title. Although a butterfly flapping its wings has remained constant in the expression of this concept, the location of the butterfly, the consequences, and the location of the consequences have varied widely.

The phrase refers to the effect of a butterfly&#x27;s wings creating tiny changes in the atmosphere that may ultimately alter the path of a tornado or delay, accelerate, or even prevent the occurrence of a tornado in another location. The butterfly does not power or directly create the tornado, but the term is intended to imply that the flap of the butterfly&#x27;s wings can &quot;cause&quot; the tornado: in the sense that the flap of the wings is a part of the initial conditions of an interconnected complex web; one set of conditions leads to a tornado, while the other set of conditions doesn&#x27;t. The flapping wing creates a small change in the initial condition of the system, which cascades to large-scale alterations of events (compare: domino effect). Had the butterfly not flapped its wings, the trajectory of the system might have been vastly different—but it&#x27;s also equally possible that the set of conditions without the butterfly flapping its wings is the set that leads to a tornado.

The butterfly effect presents an obvious challenge to prediction, since initial conditions for a system such as the weather can never be known to complete accuracy. This problem motivated the development of ensemble forecasting, in which a number of forecasts are made from perturbed initial conditions.

Some scientists have since argued that the weather system is not as sensitive to initial conditions as previously believed. David Orrell argues that the major contributor to weather forecast error is model error, with sensitivity to initial conditions playing a relatively small role. Stephen Wolfram also notes that the Lorenz equations are highly simplified and do not contain terms that represent viscous effects; he believes that these terms would tend to damp out small perturbations. Recent studies using generalized Lorenz models that included additional dissipative terms and nonlinearity suggested that a larger heating parameter is required for the onset of chaos.

While the &quot;butterfly effect&quot; is often explained as being synonymous with sensitive dependence on initial conditions of the kind described by Lorenz in his 1963 paper (and previously observed by Poincaré), the butterfly metaphor was originally applied to work he published in 1969 which took the idea a step further. Lorenz proposed a mathematical model for how tiny motions in the atmosphere scale up to affect larger systems. He found that the systems in that model could only be predicted up to a specific point in the future, and beyond that, reducing the error in the initial conditions would not increase the predictability (as long as the error is not zero). This demonstrated that a deterministic system could be &quot;observationally indistinguishable&quot; from a non-deterministic one in terms of predictability. Recent re-examinations of this paper suggest that it offered a significant challenge to the idea that our universe is deterministic, comparable to the challenges offered by quantum physics.

In the book entitled &quot;The Essence of Chaos&quot; published in 1993, Lorenz defined butterfly effect as: &quot;The phenomenon that a small alteration in the state of a dynamical system will cause subsequent states to differ greatly from the states that would have followed without the alteration.&quot; This feature is the same as sensitive dependence of solutions on initial conditions (SDIC) in . In the same book, Lorenz applied the activity of skiing and developed an idealized skiing model for revealing the sensitivity of time-varying paths to initial positions. A predictability horizon is determined before the onset of SDIC.

==Theory and mathematical definition==
Recurrence, the approximate return of a system toward its initial conditions, together with sensitive dependence on initial conditions, are the two main ingredients for chaotic motion. They have the practical consequence of making complex systems, such as the weather, difficult to predict past a certain time range (approximately a week in the case of weather) since it is impossible to measure the starting atmospheric conditions completely accurately.

A dynamical system displays sensitive dependence on initial conditions if points arbitrarily close together separate over time at an exponential rate. The definition is not topological, but essentially metrical. Lorenz defined sensitive dependence as follows:

&quot;The property characterizing an orbit (i.e., a solution) if most other orbits that pass close to it at some point do not remain close to it as time advances.&quot;

If &quot;M&quot; is the state space for the map formula_1, then formula_1 displays sensitive dependence to initial conditions if for any x in &quot;M&quot; and any δ &gt; 0, there are y in &quot;M&quot;, with distance such that formula_3 and such that
:formula_4

for some positive parameter &quot;a&quot;. The definition does not require that all points from a neighborhood separate from the base point &quot;x&quot;, but it requires one positive Lyapunov exponent. In addition to a positive Lyapunov exponent, boundedness is another major feature within chaotic systems.

The simplest mathematical framework exhibiting sensitive dependence on initial conditions is provided by a particular parametrization of the logistic map:
:formula_5

which, unlike most chaotic maps, has a closed-form solution:
:formula_6

where the initial condition parameter formula_7 is given by formula_8. For rational formula_7, after a finite number of iterations formula_10 maps into a periodic sequence. But almost all formula_7 are irrational, and, for irrational formula_7, formula_10 never repeats itself – it is non-periodic. This solution equation clearly demonstrates the two key features of chaos – stretching and folding: the factor 2&quot;n&quot; shows the exponential growth of stretching, which results in sensitive dependence on initial conditions (the butterfly effect), while the squared sine function keeps formula_10 folded within the range [0, 1].

==In physical systems==
===In weather===
==== Overview ====
The butterfly effect is most familiar in terms of weather; it can easily be demonstrated in standard weather prediction models, for example. The climate scientists James Annan and William Connolley explain that chaos is important in the development of weather prediction methods; models are sensitive to initial conditions. They add the caveat: &quot;Of course the existence of an unknown butterfly flapping its wings has no direct bearing on weather forecasts, since it will take far too long for such a small perturbation to grow to a significant size, and we have many more immediate uncertainties to worry about. So the direct impact of this phenomenon on weather prediction is often somewhat wrong.&quot;

==== Differentiating types of butterfly effects ====
The concept of the butterfly effect encompasses several phenomena. The two kinds of butterfly effects, including the sensitive dependence on initial conditions, and the ability of a tiny perturbation to create an organized circulation at large distances, are not exactly the same. In Palmer et al., a new type of butterfly effect is introduced, highlighting the potential impact of small-scale processes on finite predictability within the Lorenz 1969 model. Additionally, the identification of ill-conditioned aspects of the Lorenz 1969 model points to a practical form of finite predictability. These two distinct mechanisms suggesting finite predictability in the Lorenz 1969 model are collectively referred to as the third kind of butterfly effect. The authors in have considered Palmer et al.&#x27;s suggestions and have aimed to present their perspective without raising specific contentions.

The third kind of butterfly effect with finite predictability, as discussed in, was primarily proposed based on a convergent geometric series, known as Lorenz&#x27;s and Lilly&#x27;s formulas. Ongoing discussions are addressing the validity of these two formulas for estimating predictability limits in.

A comparison of the two kinds of butterfly effects and the third kind of butterfly effect has been documented. In recent studies, it was reported that both meteorological and non-meteorological linear models have shown that instability plays a role in producing a butterfly effect, which is characterized by brief but significant exponential growth resulting from a small disturbance.

==== Recent debates on butterfly effects ====
The first kind of butterfly effect (BE1), known as SDIC (Sensitive Dependence on Initial Conditions), is widely recognized and demonstrated through idealized chaotic models. However, opinions differ regarding the second kind of butterfly effect, specifically the impact of a butterfly flapping its wings on tornado formation, as indicated in two 2024 articles. In more recent discussions published by &quot;Physics Today&quot;, it is acknowledged that the second kind of butterfly effect (BE2) has never been rigorously verified using a realistic weather model. While the studies suggest that BE2 is unlikely in the real atmosphere, its invalidity in this context does not negate the applicability of BE1 in other areas, such as pandemics or historical events.

For the third kind of butterfly effect, the limited predictability within the Lorenz 1969 model is explained by scale interactions in one article and by system ill-conditioning in another more recent study.

==== Finite predictability in chaotic systems ====
According to Lighthill (1986), the presence of SDIC (commonly known as the butterfly effect) implies that chaotic systems have a finite predictability limit. In a literature review, it was found that Lorenz&#x27;s perspective on the predictability limit can be condensed into the following statement:

* (A). The Lorenz 1963 model qualitatively revealed the essence of a finite predictability within a chaotic system such as the atmosphere. However, it did not determine a precise limit for the predictability of the atmosphere.
* (B). In the 1960s, the two-week predictability limit was originally estimated based on a doubling time of five days in real-world models. Since then, this finding has been documented in Charney et al. (1966) and has become a consensus.

Recently, a short video has been created to present Lorenz&#x27;s perspective on predictability limit.

A recent study refers to the two-week predictability limit, initially calculated in the 1960s with the Mintz-Arakawa model&#x27;s five-day doubling time, as the &quot;Predictability Limit Hypothesis.&quot; Inspired by Moore&#x27;s Law, this term acknowledges the collaborative contributions of Lorenz, Mintz, and Arakawa under Charney&#x27;s leadership. The hypothesis supports the investigation into extended-range predictions using both partial differential equation (PDE)-based physics methods and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques.

==== Revised perspectives on chaotic and non-chaotic systems ====
By revealing coexisting chaotic and non-chaotic attractors within Lorenz models, Shen and his colleagues proposed a revised view that &quot;weather possesses chaos and order&quot;, in contrast to the conventional view of &quot;weather is chaotic&quot;. As a result, sensitive dependence on initial conditions (SDIC) does not always appear. Namely, SDIC appears when two orbits (i.e., solutions) become the chaotic attractor; it does not appear when two orbits move toward the same point attractor. The above animation for double pendulum motion provides an analogy. For large angles of swing the motion of the pendulum is often chaotic. By comparison, for small angles of swing, motions are non-chaotic.
Multistability is defined when a system (e.g., the double pendulum system) contains more than one bounded attractor that depends only on initial conditions. The multistability was illustrated using kayaking in Figure on the right side (i.e., Figure 1 of ) where the appearance of strong currents and a stagnant area suggests instability and local stability, respectively. As a result, when two kayaks move along strong currents, their paths display SDIC. On the other hand, when two kayaks move into a stagnant area, they become trapped, showing no typical SDIC (although a chaotic transient may occur). Such features of SDIC or no SDIC suggest two types of solutions and illustrate the nature of multistability.

By taking into consideration time-varying multistability that is associated with the modulation of large-scale processes (e.g., seasonal forcing) and aggregated feedback of small-scale processes (e.g., convection), the above revised view is refined as follows:

&quot;The atmosphere possesses chaos and order; it includes, as examples, emerging organized systems (such as tornadoes) and time varying forcing from recurrent seasons.&quot;

===In quantum mechanics===
The potential for sensitive dependence on initial conditions (the butterfly effect) has been studied in a number of cases in semiclassical and quantum physics, including atoms in strong fields and the anisotropic Kepler problem. Some authors have argued that extreme (exponential) dependence on initial conditions is not expected in pure quantum treatments; however, the sensitive dependence on initial conditions demonstrated in classical motion is included in the semiclassical treatments developed by Martin Gutzwiller and John B. Delos and co-workers. The random matrix theory and simulations with quantum computers prove that some versions of the butterfly effect in quantum mechanics do not exist.

Other authors suggest that the butterfly effect can be observed in quantum systems. Zbyszek P. Karkuszewski et al. consider the time evolution of quantum systems which have slightly different Hamiltonians. They investigate the level of sensitivity of quantum systems to small changes in their given Hamiltonians. David Poulin et al. presented a quantum algorithm to measure fidelity decay, which &quot;measures the rate at which identical initial states diverge when subjected to slightly different dynamics&quot;. They consider fidelity decay to be &quot;the closest quantum analog to the (purely classical) butterfly effect&quot;. Whereas the classical butterfly effect considers the effect of a small change in the position and/or velocity of an object in a given Hamiltonian system, the quantum butterfly effect considers the effect of a small change in the Hamiltonian system with a given initial position and velocity. This quantum butterfly effect has been demonstrated experimentally. Quantum and semiclassical treatments of system sensitivity to initial conditions are known as quantum chaos.

==In popular culture==
The butterfly effect has appeared across mediums such as literature (for instance, &quot;A Sound of Thunder&quot;), films and television (such as &quot;The Simpsons&quot;), video games (such as &quot;Life Is Strange&quot;), webcomics (such as &quot;Homestuck&quot;), AI-driven expansive language models, and more.

<text>Borland Software Corporation was a computing technology company founded in 1983 by Niels Jensen, Ole Henriksen, Mogens Glad, and Philippe Kahn. Its main business was developing and selling software development and software deployment products. Borland was first headquartered in Scotts Valley, California, then in Cupertino, California, and then in Austin, Texas. In 2009, the company became a full subsidiary of the British firm Micro Focus International plc. In 2023, Micro Focus (including Borland) was acquired by Canadian firm OpenText, which later absorbed Borland&#x27;s portfolio into its application delivery management division.

==History==
===The 1980s: Foundations===
Borland Ltd. was founded in August 1981 by three Danish citizens Niels Jensen, Ole Henriksen, and Mogens Glad to develop products like Word Index for the CP/M operating system using an off-the-shelf company. However, the response to the company&#x27;s products at the CP/M-82 show in San Francisco showed that a U.S. company would be needed to reach the American market. They met Philippe Kahn, who had just moved to Silicon Valley and had been a key developer of the Micral. Kahn was chairman, president, and CEO of Borland Inc. at its inception in 1983 and until 1995.

The first name for the company was not &quot;Borland&quot;. It was &quot;MIT&quot;. The acronym MIT stood for &quot;Market In Time&quot;. The name &quot;Borland&quot; originated from a small company in Ireland, which was one of MIT initial customers. After they went bankrupt, MIT sought permission to acquire and use the name &quot;Borland&quot; in the U.S., following a legal recommendation during a rebranding prompted by a letter from MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology).

The main shareholders at the incorporation of Borland were Niels Jensen (250,000 shares), Ole Henriksen (160,000), Mogens Glad (100,000), and Kahn (80,000).

===Borland International, Inc. era===
Borland developed various software development tools. Its first product was Turbo Pascal in 1983, developed by Anders Hejlsberg (who later developed .NET and C# for Microsoft) and before Borland acquired the product which was sold in Scandinavia under the name &quot;Compas Pascal&quot;. In 1984, Borland launched Sidekick, a time organization, notebook, and calculator utility that was an early terminate-and-stay-resident program (TSR) for MS-DOS compatible operating systems.

By the mid-1980s, the company had an exhibit at the 1985 West Coast Computer Faire along with IBM and AT&amp;T. Bruce Webster reported that &quot;the legend of Turbo Pascal has by now reached mythic proportions, as evidenced by the number of firms that, in marketing meetings, make plans to become &#x27;the next Borland&#x27;&quot;. After Turbo Pascal and Sidekick, the company launched other applications such as SuperKey and Lightning, all developed in Denmark. While the Danes remained majority shareholders, board members included Kahn, Tim Berry, John Nash, and David Heller. With the assistance of John Nash and David Heller, both British members of the Borland Board, the company was taken public on London&#x27;s Unlisted Securities Market (USM) in 1986.

Schroders was the lead investment banker. According to the London IPO filings, the management team was Philippe Kahn as president, Spencer Ozawa as VP of Operations, Marie Bourget as CFO, and Spencer Leyton as VP of sales and business development. All software development continued to take place in Denmark and later London as the Danish co-founders moved there. A first US IPO followed in 1989 after Ben Rosen joined the Borland board with Goldman Sachs as the lead banker and a second offering in 1991 with Lazard as the lead banker.

In 1985, Borland acquired Analytica and its Reflex database product. The engineering team of Analytica, managed by Brad Silverberg and including Reflex co-founder Adam Bosworth, became the core of Borland&#x27;s engineering team in the US. Brad Silverberg was VP of engineering until he left in early 1990 to head up the Personal Systems division at Microsoft. Adam Bosworth initiated and headed up the Quattro project until moving to Microsoft later in 1990 to take over the project which eventually became Access.

In 1987, Borland purchased Wizard Systems and incorporated portions of the Wizard C technology into Turbo C. Bob Jervis, the author of Wizard C became a Borland employee. Turbo C was released on May 18, 1987. This drove a wedge between Borland and Niels Jensen and the other members of his team who had been working on a brand-new series of compilers at their London development centre. They reached an agreement and spun off a company named Jensen &amp; Partners International (JPI), later TopSpeed. JPI first launched an MS-DOS compiler named JPI Modula-2, which later became TopSpeed Modula-2, and followed up with TopSpeed C, TopSpeed C++, and TopSpeed Pascal compilers for both the MS-DOS and OS/2 operating systems. The TopSpeed compiler technology still exists as the underlying technology of the Clarion 4GL programming language, a Windows development tool.

In September 1987, Borland purchased Ansa-Software, including their Paradox (version 2.0) database management tool. Richard Schwartz, a cofounder of Ansa, became Borland&#x27;s CTO and Ben Rosen joined the Borland board.

The Quattro Pro spreadsheet was launched in 1989. Lotus Development, under the leadership of Jim Manzi, sued Borland for copyright infringement (see Look and feel). The litigation, &quot;Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland Int&#x27;l, Inc.&quot;, brought forward Borland&#x27;s open standards position as opposed to Lotus&#x27; closed approach. Borland, under Kahn&#x27;s leadership, took a position of principle and announced that they would defend against Lotus&#x27; legal position and &quot;fight for programmer&#x27;s rights&quot;. After a decision in favour of Borland by the First Circuit Court of Appeals, the case went to the United States Supreme Court. Because Justice John Paul Stevens had recused himself, only eight justices heard the case, and concluded in a 4–4 tie. As a result, the First Circuit Court decision remained standing but did not bind any other court and set no national precedent.

Additionally, Borland&#x27;s approach towards software piracy and intellectual property (IP) included its &quot;Borland no-nonsense license agreement&quot;; allowing the developer/user to utilize its products &quot;just like a book&quot;. The user was allowed to make multiple copies of a program, as long as it was the only copy in use at any point in time.

===The 1990s: Rise and change===
In September 1991, Borland purchased Ashton-Tate, bringing the dBASE and InterBase databases to the house, in an all-stock transaction. However, competition with Microsoft was fierce. Microsoft launched the competing database Microsoft Access and bought the dBASE clone FoxPro in 1992, undercutting Borland&#x27;s prices. During the early 1990s, Borland&#x27;s implementation of C and C++ outsold Microsoft&#x27;s. Borland survived as a company, but no longer dominated the software tools that it once had. It went through a radical transition in products, financing, and staff, and became a very different company from the one which challenged Microsoft and Lotus in the early 1990s.

The internal problems that arose with the Ashton-Tate merger were a large part of the downfall. Ashton-Tate&#x27;s product portfolio proved to be weak, with no provision for evolution into the GUI environment of Windows. Almost all product lines were discontinued. The consolidation of duplicate support and development offices was costly and disruptive. Worst of all, the highest revenue earner of the combined company was dBASE with no Windows version ready. Borland had an internal project to clone dBASE which was intended to run on Windows and was part of the strategy of the acquisition, but by late 1992 this was abandoned due to technical flaws and the company had to constitute a replacement team (the ObjectVision team, redeployed) headed by Bill Turpin to redo the job.

Borland lacked the financial strength to project its marketing and move internal resources off other products to shore up the dBASE/W effort. Layoffs occurred in 1993 to keep the company afloat, the third instance of this in five years. By the time dBASE for Windows eventually shipped, the developer community had moved on to other products such as Clipper or FoxBase, and dBASE never regained a significant share of Ashton-Tate&#x27;s former market. This happened against the backdrop of the rise in Microsoft&#x27;s combined Office product marketing.

A change in market conditions also contributed to Borland&#x27;s fall from prominence. In the 1980s, companies had few people who understood the growing personal computer phenomenon and so most technical people were given free rein to purchase whatever software they thought they needed. Borland had done an excellent job marketing to those with a highly technical bent. By the mid-1990s, however, companies were beginning to ask what the return was on the investment they had made in this loosely controlled PC software buying spree. Company executives were starting to ask questions that were hard for technically minded staff to answer, and so corporate standards began to be created. This required new kinds of marketing and support materials from software vendors, but Borland remained focused on the technical side of its products.

In 1993 Borland explored ties with WordPerfect as a possible way to form a suite of programs to rival Microsoft&#x27;s nascent integration strategy. WordPerfect itself was struggling with a late and troubled transition to Windows. The eventual joint company effort, named Borland Office for Windows (a combination of the WordPerfect word processor, Quattro Pro spreadsheet, and Paradox database) was introduced at the 1993 Comdex computer show. Borland Office never made significant inroads against Microsoft Office. WordPerfect was then bought by Novell. In October 1994, Borland sold Quattro Pro and rights to sell up to a million copies of Paradox to Novell for $140 million in cash, repositioning the company on its core software development tools and the Interbase database engine and shifting toward client-server scenarios in corporate applications. This later proved a good foundation for the shift to web development tools.

Philippe Kahn and the Borland board disagreed on how to focus the company, and Kahn resigned as chairman, CEO and president, after 12 years, in January 1995. Kahn remained on the board until November 7, 1996. Borland named Gary Wetsel as CEO, but he resigned in July 1996. William F. Miller was interim CEO until September of that year, when Whitney G. Lynn (the current chairman at mergers &amp; acquisitions company XRP Healthcare) became interim president and CEO (along with other executive changes), followed by a succession of CEOs including Dale Fuller and Tod Nielsen.

The Delphi 1 rapid application development (RAD) environment was launched in 1995, under the leadership of Anders Hejlsberg.

In 1996 Borland acquired Open Environment Corporation, a Cambridge-based company founded by John J. Donovan.

On November 25, 1996, Del Yocam was hired as Borland CEO and chairman.

In 1997, Borland sold Paradox to Corel, but retained all development rights for the core BDE. In November 1997, Borland acquired Visigenic, a middleware company that was focused on implementations of CORBA.

===Inprise Corporation era===
In April 1998, Borland International, Inc. announced it had become Inprise Corporation.

For several years, before and during the Inprise name, Borland suffered from serious financial losses and poor public image. When the name was changed to Inprise, many thought Borland had gone out of business. In March 1999, dBASE was sold to KSoft, Inc. which was soon renamed dBASE Inc. (In 2004 dBASE Inc. was renamed to DataBased Intelligence, Inc.).

In 1999, Dale L. Fuller replaced Yocam. At this time Fuller&#x27;s title was &quot;interim president and CEO&quot;. The &quot;interim&quot; was dropped in December 2000. Keith Gottfried served in senior executive positions with the company from 2000 to 2004.

A proposed merger between Inprise and Corel was announced in February 2000, aimed at producing Linux-based products. The plan was abandoned when Corel&#x27;s shares fell and it became clear that there was no strategic fit.

InterBase 6.0 was made available as open-source software in July 2000.

In November 2000, Inprise Corporation announced the company intended to officially change its name to Borland Software Corporation. The legal name of the company would continue to be Inprise Corporation until the completion of the renaming process during the first quarter of 2001. Once the name change was completed, the company would also expect to change its Nasdaq market symbol from &quot;INPR&quot; to &quot;BORL&quot;.

===Borland Software Corporation era===
On January 2, 2001, Borland Software Corporation announced it had completed its name change from Inprise Corporation. Effective at the opening of trading on Nasdaq, the company&#x27;s Nasdaq market symbol would also be changed from &quot;INPR&quot; to &quot;BORL&quot;.

Under the Borland name and a new management team headed by president and CEO Dale L. Fuller, a now-smaller and profitable Borland refocused on Delphi and created a version of Delphi and C++Builder for Linux, both under the name Kylix. This brought Borland&#x27;s expertise in integrated development environments to the Linux platform for the first time. Kylix was launched in 2001.

Plans to spin off the InterBase division as a separate company were abandoned after Borland and the people who were to run the new company could not agree on terms for the separation. Borland stopped open-source releases of InterBase and has developed and sold new versions at a fast pace.

In 2001, Delphi 6 became the first integrated development environment to support web services. All of the company&#x27;s development platforms now support web services.

C#Builder was released in 2003 as a native C# development tool, competing with Visual Studio .NET. By the 2005 release, C#Builder, Delphi for Win32, and Delphi for .NET were combined into one IDE named &quot;Borland Developer Studio&quot;, though it was still 
popularly known as &quot;Delphi&quot;. In late 2002 Borland purchased design tool vendor TogetherSoft and tool publisher Starbase, makers of the StarTeam configuration management tool and the CaliberRM requirements management tool (eventually, CaliberRM was renamed as &quot;Caliber&quot;). The latest releases of JBuilder and Delphi integrate these tools to give developers a broader set of tools for development.

Former CEO Dale Fuller quit in July 2005, but remained on the board of directors. Former COO Scott Arnold took the title of interim president and chief executive officer until November 8, 2005, when it was announced that Tod Nielsen would take over as CEO effective November 9, 2005. Nielsen remained with the company until January 2009, when he accepted the position of chief operating officer at VMware; CFO Erik Prusch then took over as acting president and CEO.

In early 2007 Borland announced new branding for its focus around open application life-cycle management. In April 2007 Borland announced that it would relocate its headquarters and development facilities to Austin, Texas. It also had development centers in Singapore, Santa Ana, California, and Linz, Austria.

On May 6, 2009, the company announced it was to be acquired by Micro Focus for $75 million. The transaction was approved by Borland shareholders on July 22, 2009, with Micro Focus acquiring the company for $1.50 per share. Following Micro Focus shareholder approval and the required corporate filings, the transaction was completed in late July 2009. Borland was estimated to have 750 employees at the time.

On April 5, 2015, Micro Focus announced the completion of integrating the Attachmate Group of companies that was merged on November 20, 2014. During the integration period, the affected companies were merged into one organization. In the announced reorganization, Borland products would be part of the Micro Focus portfolio.

==Subsidiaries==
*Leaders: In October 2005, Borland acquired Leaders, to add its IT management and governance suite, named Tempo, to the Borland product line.
*CodeGear: On February 8, 2006, Borland announced the divestiture of their IDE division, including Delphi, JBuilder, and InterBase. At the same time, they announced the planned acquisition of Segue Software, a maker of software test and quality tools, to concentrate on application life-cycle management (ALM). On March 20, 2006, Borland announced its acquisition of Gauntlet Systems, a provider of technology that screens software under development for quality and security. On November 14, 2006, Borland announced its decision to separate the developer tools group into a wholly-owned subsidiary. The newly formed operation, CodeGear, was responsible for four IDE product lines. On May 7, 2008, Borland announced the sale of the CodeGear division to Embarcadero Technologies for an expected price and in CodeGear accounts receivables retained by Borland.

The products acquired from Segue Software include Silk Central, Silk Performer, and Silk Test. The Silk line was first announced in 1997. Other programs are:

===Historical products===
===Unreleased software===
* Turbo Modula-2: Later sold by TopSpeed as TopSpeed Modula-2.

==Marketing==
* &quot;CB Magazine&quot;: It is an official magazine by Borland Japan. The magazine was republished on April 3, 1997.

===Renaming to Inprise Corporation===
Along with renaming from Borland International, Inc. to Inprise Corporation, the company refocused its efforts on targeting enterprise applications development. Borland hired a marketing firm Lexicon Branding to come up with a new name for the company. Yocam explained that the new name, Inprise, was meant to evoke &quot;integrating the enterprise&quot;. The idea was to integrate Borland&#x27;s tools, Delphi, C++Builder, and JBuilder with enterprise environment software, including Visigenic&#x27;s implementations of CORBA, Visibroker for C++ and Java, and the new product, Application Server.

===Frank Borland===
Frank Borland is a mascot character for Borland products. According to Philippe Kahn, the mascot first appeared in advertisements and the cover of Borland Sidekick 1.0 manual, which was in 1984 during Borland International, Inc. era. Frank Borland also appeared in Turbo Tutor - A Turbo Pascal Tutorial, Borland JBuilder 2.

A live action version of Frank Borland was made after Micro Focus plc had acquired Borland Software Corporation. This version was created by True Agency Limited. An introductory film was also made about the mascot.

<text>Richard Buckminster Fuller (; July 12, 1895 – July 1, 1983) was an American architect, systems theorist, writer, designer, inventor, philosopher, and futurist. He styled his name as R. Buckminster Fuller in his writings, publishing more than 30 books and coining or popularizing such terms as &quot;Spaceship Earth&quot;, &quot;Dymaxion&quot; (e.g., Dymaxion house, Dymaxion car, Dymaxion map), &quot;ephemeralization&quot;, &quot;synergetics&quot;, and &quot;tensegrity&quot;.

Fuller developed numerous inventions, mainly architectural designs, and popularized the widely known geodesic dome; carbon molecules known as fullerenes were later named by scientists for their structural and mathematical resemblance to geodesic spheres. He also served as the second World President of Mensa International from 1974 to 1983.

Fuller was awarded 28 United States patents and many honorary doctorates. In 1960, he was awarded the Frank P. Brown Medal from The Franklin Institute. He was elected an honorary member of Phi Beta Kappa in 1967, on the occasion of the 50-year reunion of his Harvard class of 1917 (from which he had been expelled in his first year). He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1968. The same year, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member. He became a full Academician in 1970, and he received the Gold Medal award from the American Institute of Architects the same year. Also in 1970, Fuller received the title of Master Architect from Alpha Rho Chi (APX), the national fraternity for architecture and the allied arts.
In 1976, he received the St. Louis Literary Award from the Saint Louis University Library Associates. In 1977, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. He also received numerous other awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, presented to him on February 23, 1983, by President Ronald Reagan.

== Life and work ==

Fuller was born on July 12, 1895, in Milton, Massachusetts, the son of Richard Buckminster Fuller, a prosperous leather and tea merchant, and Caroline Wolcott Andrews. He was a grand-nephew of Margaret Fuller, an American journalist, critic, and women&#x27;s rights advocate associated with the American transcendentalism movement. The unusual middle name, Buckminster, was an ancestral family name. As a child, Richard Buckminster Fuller tried numerous variations of his name. He used to sign his name differently each year in the guest register of his family summer vacation home at Bear Island, Maine. He finally settled on R. Buckminster Fuller.

Fuller spent much of his youth on Bear Island, in Penobscot Bay off the coast of Maine. He attended Froebelian Kindergarten He was dissatisfied with the way geometry was taught in school, disagreeing with the notions that a chalk dot on the blackboard represented an &quot;empty&quot; mathematical point, or that a line could stretch off to infinity. To him these were illogical, and led to his work on synergetics. He often made items from materials he found in the woods, and sometimes made his own tools. He experimented with designing a new apparatus for human propulsion of small boats. By age 12, he had invented a &#x27;push pull&#x27; system for propelling a rowboat by use of an inverted umbrella connected to the transom with a simple oar lock which allowed the user to face forward to point the boat toward its destination. Later in life, Fuller took exception to the term &quot;invention.&quot; 

Years later, he decided that this sort of experience had provided him with not only an interest in design, but also a habit of being familiar with and knowledgeable about the materials that his later projects would require. Fuller earned a machinist&#x27;s certification, and knew how to use the press brake, stretch press, and other tools and equipment used in the sheet metal trade.

=== Education ===

Fuller attended Milton Academy in Massachusetts, and after that began studying at Harvard College, where he was affiliated with Adams House. He was expelled from Harvard twice: first for spending all his money partying with a vaudeville troupe, and then, after having been readmitted, for his &quot;irresponsibility and lack of interest.&quot; By his own appraisal, he was a non-conforming misfit in the fraternity environment.

=== Wartime experience ===

Between his sessions at Harvard, Fuller worked in Canada as a mechanic in a textile mill, and later as a laborer in the meat-packing industry. 

He also served in the U.S. Navy in World War I, as a shipboard radio operator, as an editor of a publication, and as commander of the crash rescue boat USS &quot;Inca&quot;. After discharge, he worked again in the meat-packing industry, acquiring management experience. 

In 1917, he married Anne Hewlett. During the early 1920s, he and his father-in-law developed the Stockade Building System for producing lightweight, weatherproof, and fireproof housing—although the company would ultimately fail in 1927.

=== Depression and epiphany ===
Fuller recalled 1927 as a pivotal year of his life. His daughter Alexandra had died in 1922 of complications from polio and spinal meningitis just before her fourth birthday. Barry Katz, a Stanford University scholar who wrote about Fuller, found signs that around this time in his life Fuller had developed depression and anxiety. Fuller dwelled on his daughter&#x27;s death, suspecting that it was connected with the Fullers&#x27; damp and drafty living conditions. This provided motivation for Fuller&#x27;s involvement in Stockade Building Systems, a business which aimed to provide affordable, efficient housing.

In 1927, at age 32, Fuller lost his job as president of Stockade. The Fuller family had no savings, and the birth of their daughter Allegra in 1927 added to the financial challenges. Fuller drank heavily and reflected upon the solution to his family&#x27;s struggles on long walks around Chicago. During the autumn of 1927, Fuller contemplated suicide by drowning in Lake Michigan, so that his family could benefit from a life insurance payment.

Fuller said that he had experienced a profound incident which would provide direction and purpose for his life. He felt as though he was suspended several feet above the ground enclosed in a white sphere of light. A voice spoke directly to Fuller, and declared:

Fuller stated that this experience led to a profound re-examination of his life. He ultimately chose to embark on &quot;an experiment, to find what a single individual could contribute to changing the world and benefiting all humanity.&quot;

Speaking to audiences later in life, Fuller would frequently recount the story of his Lake Michigan experience, and its transformative impact on his life.

=== Recovery ===

In 1927, Fuller resolved to think independently which included a commitment to &quot;the search for the principles governing the universe and help advance the evolution of humanity in accordance with them ... finding ways of &quot;doing more with less&quot; to the end that all people everywhere can have more and more.&quot; By 1928, Fuller was living in Greenwich Village and spending much of his time at the popular café Romany Marie&#x27;s, where he had spent an evening in conversation with Marie and Eugene O&#x27;Neill several years earlier. Fuller accepted a job decorating the interior of the café in exchange for meals, giving informal lectures several times a week, and models of the Dymaxion house were exhibited at the café. Isamu Noguchi arrived during 1929—Constantin Brâncuși, an old friend of Marie&#x27;s, had directed him there—and Noguchi and Fuller were soon collaborating on several projects, including the modeling of the Dymaxion car based on recent work by Aurel Persu. It was the beginning of their lifelong friendship.

=== Geodesic domes ===

Fuller taught at Black Mountain College in North Carolina during the summers of 1948 and 1949, serving as its Summer Institute director in 1949. Fuller had been shy and withdrawn, but he was persuaded to participate in a theatrical performance of Erik Satie&#x27;s &quot;Le piège de Méduse&quot; produced by John Cage, who was also teaching at Black Mountain. During rehearsals, under the tutelage of Arthur Penn, then a student at Black Mountain, Fuller broke through his inhibitions to become confident as a performer and speaker.

At Black Mountain, with the support of a group of professors and students, he began reinventing a project that would make him famous: the geodesic dome. Although the geodesic dome had been created, built and awarded a German patent on June 19, 1925, by Dr. Walther Bauersfeld, Fuller was awarded United States patents. Fuller&#x27;s patent application made no mention of Bauersfeld&#x27;s self-supporting dome built some 26 years prior. Although Fuller undoubtedly popularized this type of structure he is mistakenly given credit for its design.

One of his early models was first constructed in 1945 at Bennington College in Vermont, where he lectured often. Although Bauersfeld&#x27;s dome could support a full skin of concrete it was not until 1949 that Fuller erected a geodesic dome building that could sustain its own weight with no practical limits. It was in diameter and constructed of aluminium aircraft tubing and a vinyl-plastic skin, in the form of an icosahedron. To prove his design, Fuller suspended from the structure&#x27;s framework several students who had helped him build it. The U.S. government recognized the importance of this work, and employed his firm Geodesics, Inc. in Raleigh, North Carolina to make small domes for the Marines. Within a few years, there were thousands of such domes around the world.
Fuller&#x27;s first &quot;continuous tension – discontinuous compression&quot; geodesic dome (full sphere in this case) was constructed at the University of Oregon Architecture School in 1959 with the help of students. These continuous tension – discontinuous compression structures featured single force compression members (no flexure or bending moments) that did not touch each other and were &#x27;suspended&#x27; by the tensional members.

=== Dymaxion Chronofile ===
For half of a century, Fuller developed many ideas, designs, and inventions, particularly regarding practical, inexpensive shelter and transportation. He documented his life, philosophy, and ideas scrupulously by a daily diary (later called the &quot;Dymaxion Chronofile&quot;), and by twenty-eight publications. Fuller financed some of his experiments with inherited funds, sometimes augmented by funds invested by his collaborators, one example being the Dymaxion car project.

=== World stage ===


International recognition began with the success of huge geodesic domes during the 1950s. Fuller lectured at North Carolina State University in Raleigh in 1949, where he met James Fitzgibbon, who would become a close friend and colleague. Fitzgibbon was director of Geodesics, Inc. and Synergetics, Inc. the first licensees to design geodesic domes. Thomas C. Howard was lead designer, architect, and engineer for both companies. Richard Lewontin, a new faculty member in population genetics at North Carolina State University, provided Fuller with computer calculations for the lengths of the domes&#x27; edges.

Fuller began working with architect Shoji Sadao in 1954, together designing a hypothetical Dome over Manhattan in 1960, and in 1964 they co-founded the architectural firm Fuller &amp; Sadao Inc., whose first project was to design the large geodesic dome for the U.S. Pavilion at Expo 67 in Montreal. This building is now the &quot;Montreal Biosphère&quot;.
In 1962, the artist and searcher John McHale wrote the first monograph on Fuller, published by George Braziller in New York.

After employing several Southern Illinois University Carbondale (SIU) graduate students to rebuild his models following an apartment fire in the summer of 1959, Fuller was recruited by longtime friend Harold Cohen to serve as a research professor of &quot;design science exploration&quot; at the institution&#x27;s School of Art and Design. According to SIU architecture professor Jon Davey, the position was &quot;unlike most faculty appointments ... more a celebrity role than a teaching job&quot; in which Fuller offered few courses and was only stipulated to spend two months per year on campus. Nevertheless, his time in Carbondale was &quot;extremely productive&quot;, and Fuller was promoted to university professor in 1968 and distinguished university professor in 1972.

Working as a designer, scientist, developer, and writer, he continued to lecture for many years around the world. He collaborated at SIU with John McHale. In 1965, they inaugurated the World Design Science Decade (1965 to 1975) at the meeting of the International Union of Architects in Paris, which was, in Fuller&#x27;s own words, devoted to &quot;applying the principles of science to solving the problems of humanity.&quot;

From 1972 until retiring as university professor emeritus in 1975, Fuller held a joint appointment at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, where he had designed the dome for the campus Religious Center in 1971. During this period, he also held a joint fellowship at a consortium of Philadelphia-area institutions, including the University of Pennsylvania, Bryn Mawr College, Haverford College, Swarthmore College, and the University City Science Center; as a result of this affiliation, the University of Pennsylvania appointed him university professor emeritus in 1975.

Fuller believed human societies would soon rely mainly on renewable sources of energy, such as solar- and wind-derived electricity. He hoped for an age of &quot;omni-successful education and sustenance of all humanity.&quot; Fuller referred to himself as &quot;the property of universe&quot; and during one radio interview he gave later in life, declared himself and his work &quot;the property of all humanity.&quot; For his lifetime of work, the American Humanist Association named him the 1969 Humanist of the Year.

In 1976, Fuller was a key participant at UN Habitat I, the first UN forum on human settlements.

=== Last filmed appearance ===

Fuller was interviewed on film on June 21, 1983, in which he spoke at Norman Foster&#x27;s Royal Gold Medal for architecture ceremony. His speech can be watched in the archives of the AA School of Architecture, in which he spoke after Sir Robert Sainsbury&#x27;s introductory speech and Foster&#x27;s keynote address.

In May, 1983 Buckminster Fuller participated in an interview with futurist Barbara Marx Hubbard. The hour-long DVD, &quot;Our Spiritual Experience: A Conversation with Buckminster Fuller and Barbara Marx Hubbard&quot; was produced by David L. Smith and was hosted by Michael Toms of New Dimensions Radio. The program was recorded at Xavier University in Cincinnati, Ohio. It can be viewed at Spiritual Visionaries.com, a new website expected to go &quot;public&quot; in February, 2025.[David L. Smith Productions]

=== Death ===

In the year of his death, Fuller described himself as follows:
Fuller died on July 1, 1983, 11 days before his 88th birthday. During the period leading up to his death, his wife had been lying comatose in a Los Angeles hospital, dying of cancer. It was while visiting her there that he exclaimed, at a certain point: &quot;She is squeezing my hand!&quot; He then stood up, had a heart attack, and died an hour later, at age 87. His wife of 66 years died 36 hours later. They are buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

== Philosophy ==

Buckminster Fuller was a Unitarian, and, like his grandfather Arthur Buckminster Fuller (brother of Margaret Fuller), a Unitarian minister. Fuller was also an early environmental activist, aware of Earth&#x27;s finite resources, and promoted a principle he termed &quot;ephemeralization&quot;, which, according to futurist and Fuller disciple Stewart Brand, was defined as &quot;doing more with less&quot;. Resources and waste from crude, inefficient products could be recycled into making more valuable products, thus increasing the efficiency of the entire process. Fuller also coined the word synergetics, a catch-all term used broadly for communicating experiences using geometric concepts, and more specifically, the empirical study of systems in transformation; his focus was on total system behavior unpredicted by the behavior of any isolated components.

Fuller was a pioneer in thinking globally and explored energy and material efficiency in the fields of architecture, engineering, and design. In his book &quot;Critical Path&quot; (1981) he cited the opinion of François de Chadenèdes (1920–1999) that petroleum, from the standpoint of its replacement cost in our current energy &quot;budget&quot; (essentially, the net incoming solar flux), had cost nature &quot;over a million dollars&quot; per U.S. gallon ($300,000 per litre) to produce. From this point of view, its use as a transportation fuel by people commuting to work represents a huge net loss compared to their actual earnings. An encapsulation quotation of his views might best be summed up as: &quot;There is no energy crisis, only a crisis of ignorance.&quot;

Though Fuller was concerned about sustainability and human survival under the existing socioeconomic system, he remained optimistic about humanity&#x27;s future. Defining wealth in terms of knowledge as the &quot;technological ability to protect, nurture, support, and accommodate all growth needs of life&quot;, his analysis of the condition of &quot;Spaceship Earth&quot; caused him to conclude that at a certain time during the 1970s, humanity had attained an unprecedented state. He was convinced that the accumulation of relevant knowledge, combined with the quantities of major recyclable resources that had already been extracted from the earth, had attained a critical level, such that competition for necessities had become unnecessary. Cooperation had become the optimum survival strategy. He declared: &quot;selfishness is unnecessary and hence-forth unrationalizable ... War is obsolete.&quot; He criticized previous utopian schemes as too exclusive and thought this was a major source of their failure. To work, he felt that a utopia needed to include everyone.

Fuller was influenced by Alfred Korzybski&#x27;s idea of general semantics. In the 1950s, Fuller attended seminars and workshops organized by the Institute of General Semantics, and he delivered the annual Alfred Korzybski Memorial Lecture in 1955. Korzybski is mentioned in the Introduction of his book &quot;Synergetics&quot;. The two shared a remarkable amount of similarity in their general semantics formulations.

In his 1970 book, &quot;I Seem To Be a Verb&quot;, he wrote: &quot;I live on Earth at present, and I don&#x27;t know what I am. I know that I am not a category. I am not a thing—a noun. I seem to be a verb, an evolutionary process—an integral function of the universe.&quot;

Fuller wrote that the universe&#x27;s natural analytic geometry was based on tetrahedra arrays. He developed this in several ways, from the close-packing of spheres and the number of compressive or tensile members required to stabilize an object in space. One confirming result was that the strongest possible homogeneous truss is cyclically tetrahedral.

He had become a guru of the design, architecture, and &quot;alternative&quot; communities, such as Drop City, the community of experimental artists to whom he awarded the 1966 &quot;Dymaxion Award&quot; for &quot;poetically economic&quot; domed living structures.

== Major design projects ==

=== The geodesic dome ===

Fuller was most famous for his lattice shell structures – geodesic domes, which have been used as parts of military radar stations, civic buildings, environmental protest camps, and exhibition attractions. An examination of the geodesic design by Walther Bauersfeld for the Zeiss-Planetarium, built some 28 years prior to Fuller&#x27;s work, reveals that Fuller&#x27;s Geodesic Dome patent (U.S. 2,682,235; awarded in 1954) is the same design as Bauersfeld&#x27;s.

Their construction is based on extending some basic principles to build simple &quot;tensegrity&quot; structures (tetrahedron, octahedron, and the closest packing of spheres), making them lightweight and stable. The geodesic dome was a result of Fuller&#x27;s exploration of nature&#x27;s constructing principles to find design solutions. The Fuller Dome is referenced in the Hugo Award-winning 1968 novel &quot;Stand on Zanzibar&quot; by John Brunner, in which a geodesic dome is said to cover the entire island of Manhattan, and it floats on air due to the hot-air balloon effect of the large air-mass under the dome (and perhaps its construction of lightweight materials).

=== Transportation ===



The Dymaxion car was a vehicle designed by Fuller, featured prominently at Chicago&#x27;s 1933-1934 Century of Progress World&#x27;s Fair. During the Great Depression, Fuller formed the &quot;Dymaxion Corporation&quot; and built three prototypes with noted naval architect Starling Burgess and a team of 27 workmen — using donated money as well as a family inheritance.

Fuller associated the word &quot;Dymaxion&quot;, a blend of the words dynamic&quot;, maximum&quot;, and &quot;tension&quot; to sum up the goal of his study, &quot;maximum gain of advantage from minimal energy input&quot;.

The Dymaxion was not an automobile but rather the &#x27;ground-taxying mode&#x27; of a vehicle that might one day be designed to fly, land and drive — an &quot;Omni-Medium Transport&quot; for air, land and water. Fuller focused on the landing and taxiing qualities, and noted severe limitations in its handling. The team made improvements and refinements to the platform, and Fuller noted the Dymaxion &quot;was an invention that could not be made available to the general public without considerable improvements&quot;.

The bodywork was aerodynamically designed for increased fuel efficiency and its platform featured a lightweight cromoly-steel hinged chassis, rear-mounted V8 engine, front-drive, and three-wheels. The vehicle was steered via the third wheel at the rear, capable of 90° steering lock. Able to steer in a tight circle, the Dymaxion often caused a sensation, bringing nearby traffic to a halt.

Shortly after launch, a prototype rolled over and crashed, killing the Dymaxion&#x27;s driver and seriously injuring its passengers. Fuller blamed the accident on a second car that collided with the Dymaxion. Eyewitnesses reported, however, that the other car hit the Dymaxion only after it had begun to roll over.

Despite courting the interest of important figures from the auto industry, Fuller used his family inheritance to finish the second and third prototypes — eventually selling all three, dissolving &quot;Dymaxion Corporation&quot; and maintaining the Dymaxion was never intended as a commercial venture. One of the three original prototypes survives.

=== Housing ===
Fuller&#x27;s energy-efficient and inexpensive Dymaxion house garnered much interest, but only two prototypes were ever produced. Here the term &quot;Dymaxion&quot; is used in effect to signify a &quot;radically strong and light tensegrity structure&quot;. One of Fuller&#x27;s Dymaxion Houses is on display as a permanent exhibit at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan. Designed and developed during the mid-1940s, this prototype is a round structure (not a dome), shaped something like the flattened &quot;bell&quot; of certain jellyfish. It has several innovative features, including revolving dresser drawers, and a fine-mist shower that reduces water consumption. According to Fuller biographer Steve Crooks, the house was designed to be delivered in two cylindrical packages, with interior color panels available at local dealers. A circular structure at the top of the house was designed to rotate around a central mast to use natural winds for cooling and air circulation.

Conceived nearly two decades earlier, and developed in Wichita, Kansas, the house was designed to be lightweight, adapted to windy climates, cheap to produce and easy to assemble. Because of its light weight and portability, the Dymaxion House was intended to be the ideal housing for individuals and families who wanted the option of easy mobility. The design included a &quot;Go-Ahead-With-Life Room&quot; stocked with maps, charts, and helpful tools for travel &quot;through time and space&quot;. It was to be produced using factories, workers, and technologies that had produced World War II aircraft. It looked ultramodern at the time, built of metal, and sheathed in polished aluminum. The basic model enclosed of floor area. Due to publicity, there were many orders during the early Post-War years, but the company that Fuller and others had formed to produce the houses failed due to management problems.

In 1967, Fuller developed a concept for an offshore floating city named Triton City and published a report on the design the following year. Models of the city aroused the interest of President Lyndon B. Johnson who, after leaving office, had them placed in the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum.

In 1969, Fuller began the Otisco Project, named after its location in Otisco, New York. The project developed and demonstrated concrete spray with mesh-covered wireforms for producing large-scale, load-bearing spanning structures built on-site, without the use of pouring molds, other adjacent surfaces, or hoisting. The initial method used a circular concrete footing in which anchor posts were set. Tubes cut to length and with ends flattened were then bolted together to form a duodeca-rhombicahedron (22-sided hemisphere) geodesic structure with spans ranging to . The form was then draped with layers of ¼-inch wire mesh attached by twist ties. Concrete was sprayed onto the structure, building up a solid layer which, when cured, would support additional concrete to be added by a variety of traditional means. Fuller referred to these buildings as monolithic ferroconcrete geodesic domes. However, the tubular frame form proved problematic for setting windows and doors. It was replaced by an iron rebar set vertically in the concrete footing and then bent inward and welded in place to create the dome&#x27;s wireform structure and performed satisfactorily. Domes up to three stories tall built with this method proved to be remarkably strong. Other shapes such as cones, pyramids, and arches proved equally adaptable.

The project was enabled by a grant underwritten by Syracuse University and sponsored by U.S. Steel (rebar), the Johnson Wire Corp (mesh), and Portland Cement Company (concrete). The ability to build large complex load bearing concrete spanning structures in free space would open many possibilities in architecture, and is considered one of Fuller&#x27;s greatest contributions.

=== Dymaxion map and World Game ===

Fuller, along with co-cartographer Shoji Sadao, also designed an alternative projection map, called the Dymaxion map. This was designed to show Earth&#x27;s continents with minimum distortion when projected or printed on a flat surface.

In the 1960s, Fuller developed the World Game, a collaborative simulation game played on a 70-by-35-foot Dymaxion map, in which players attempt to solve world problems. The object of the simulation game is, in Fuller&#x27;s words, to &quot;make the world work, for 100% of humanity, in the shortest possible time, through spontaneous cooperation, without ecological offense or the disadvantage of anyone&quot;.

== Appearance and style ==

Buckminster Fuller wore thick-lensed spectacles to correct his extreme hyperopia, a condition that went undiagnosed for the first five years of his life. Fuller&#x27;s hearing was damaged during his naval service in World War I and deteriorated during the 1960s. After experimenting with bullhorns as hearing aids during the mid-1960s, Fuller adopted electronic hearing aids from the 1970s onward.

In public appearances, Fuller always wore dark-colored suits, appearing like &quot;an alert little clergyman&quot;. Previously, he had experimented with unconventional clothing immediately after his 1927 epiphany, but found that breaking social fashion customs made others devalue or dismiss his ideas. Fuller learned the importance of physical appearance as part of one&#x27;s credibility, and decided to become &quot;the invisible man&quot; by dressing in clothes that would not draw attention to himself. With self-deprecating humor, Fuller described this black-suited appearance as resembling a &quot;second-rate bank clerk&quot;.

Writer Guy Davenport met him in 1965 and described him thus:

== Lifestyle ==

Following his global prominence from the 1960s onward, Fuller became a frequent flier, often crossing time zones to lecture. In the 1960s and 1970s, he wore three watches simultaneously; one for the time zone of his office at Southern Illinois University, one for the time zone of the location he would next visit, and one for the time zone he was currently in. In the 1970s, Fuller was only in &#x27;homely&#x27; locations (his personal home in Carbondale, Illinois; his holiday retreat in Bear Island, Maine; and his daughter&#x27;s home in Pacific Palisades, California) roughly 65 nights per year—the other 300 nights were spent in hotel beds in the locations he visited on his lecturing and consulting circuits.

In the 1920s, Fuller experimented with polyphasic sleep, which he called &quot;Dymaxion sleep&quot;. Inspired by the sleep habits of animals such as dogs and cats, Fuller worked until he was tired, and then slept short naps. This generally resulted in Fuller sleeping 30-minute naps every 6 hours. This allowed him &quot;twenty-two thinking hours a day&quot;, which aided his work productivity. Fuller reportedly kept this Dymaxion sleep habit for two years, before quitting the routine because it conflicted with his business associates&#x27; sleep habits. Despite no longer personally partaking in the habit, in 1943 Fuller suggested Dymaxion sleep as a strategy that the United States could adopt to win World War II.

Despite only practicing true polyphasic sleep for a period during the 1920s, Fuller was known for his stamina throughout his life. He was described as &quot;tireless&quot; by Barry Farrell in &quot;Life&quot; magazine, who noted that Fuller stayed up all night replying to mail during Farrell&#x27;s 1970 trip to Bear Island. In his seventies, Fuller generally slept for 5–8 hours per night.

Fuller documented his life copiously from 1915 to 1983, approximately of papers in a collection called the Dymaxion Chronofile. He also kept copies of all incoming and outgoing correspondence. The enormous R. Buckminster Fuller Collection is currently housed at Stanford University.

== Language and neologisms ==

Buckminster Fuller spoke and wrote in a unique style and said it was important to describe the world as accurately as possible. Fuller often created long run-on sentences and used unusual compound words (omniwell-informed, intertransformative, omni-interaccommodative, omniself-regenerative), as well as terms he himself invented. His style of speech was characterized by progressively rapid and breathless delivery and rambling digressions of thought, which Fuller described as &quot;thinking out loud&quot;. The effect, combined with Fuller&#x27;s dry voice and non-rhotic New England accent, was varyingly considered &quot;hypnotic&quot; or &quot;overwhelming&quot;.

Fuller used the word &quot;Universe&quot; without the definite or indefinite article (&quot;the&quot; or &quot;a&quot;) and always capitalized the word. Fuller wrote that &quot;by Universe I mean: the aggregate of all humanity&#x27;s consciously apprehended and communicated (to self or others) Experiences&quot;.

The words &quot;down&quot; and &quot;up&quot;, according to Fuller, are awkward in that they refer to a planar concept of direction inconsistent with human experience. The words &quot;in&quot; and &quot;out&quot; should be used instead, he argued, because they better describe an object&#x27;s relation to a gravitational center, the Earth. &quot;I suggest to audiences that they say, &#x27;I&#x27;m going &quot;outstairs&quot; and &quot;instairs.&quot;&#x27; At first that sounds strange to them; They all laugh about it. But if they try saying in and out for a few days in fun, they find themselves beginning to realize that they are indeed going inward and outward in respect to the center of Earth, which is our Spaceship Earth. And for the first time they begin to feel real &#x27;reality.&#x27;&quot;

Fuller preferred the term &quot;world-around&quot; to replace &quot;worldwide&quot;. The general belief in a flat Earth died out in classical antiquity, so using &quot;wide&quot; is an anachronism when referring to the surface of the Earth—a spheroidal surface has area and encloses a volume but has no width. Fuller held that unthinking use of obsolete scientific ideas detracts from and misleads intuition. Other neologisms collectively invented by the Fuller family, according to Allegra Fuller Snyder, are the terms &quot;sunsight&quot; and &quot;sunclipse&quot;, replacing &quot;sunrise&quot; and &quot;sunset&quot; to overturn the geocentric bias of most pre-Copernican celestial mechanics.

Fuller also invented the word &quot;livingry&quot;, as opposed to weaponry (or &quot;killingry&quot;), to mean that which is in support of all human, plant, and Earth life. &quot;The architectural profession—civil, naval, aeronautical, and astronautical—has always been the place where the most competent thinking is conducted regarding livingry, as opposed to weaponry.&quot;

As well as contributing significantly to the development of tensegrity technology, Fuller invented the term &quot;tensegrity&quot;, a portmanteau of &quot;tensional integrity&quot;. &quot;Tensegrity describes a structural-relationship principle in which structural shape is guaranteed by the finitely closed, comprehensively continuous, tensional behaviors of the system and not by the discontinuous and exclusively local compressional member behaviors. Tensegrity provides the ability to yield increasingly without ultimately breaking or coming asunder.&quot;

&quot;Dymaxion&quot; is a portmanteau of &quot;dynamic maximum tension&quot;. It was invented around 1929 by two admen at Marshall Field&#x27;s department store in Chicago to describe Fuller&#x27;s concept house, which was shown as part of a house of the future store display. They created the term using three words that Fuller used repeatedly to describe his design – dynamic, maximum, and tension.

Fuller also helped to popularize the concept of Spaceship Earth: &quot;The most important fact about Spaceship Earth: an instruction manual didn&#x27;t come with it.&quot;

In the preface for his &quot;cosmic fairy tale&quot; &quot;Tetrascroll: Goldilocks and the Three Bears&quot;, Fuller stated that his distinctive speaking style grew out of years of embellishing the classic tale for the benefit of his daughter, allowing him to explore both his new theories and how to present them. The &quot;Tetrascroll&quot; narrative was eventually transcribed onto a set of tetrahedral lithographs (hence the name), as well as being published as a traditional book.

Fuller&#x27;s language posed problems for his credibility. John Julius Norwich recalled commissioning a 600-word introduction for a planned history of world architecture from him, and receiving a 3500-word proposal which ended: 

Norwich commented: &quot;On reflection, I asked Dr. Nikolaus Pevsner instead.&quot;

An allotrope of carbon, fullerene—and a particular molecule of that allotrope C60 (buckminsterfullerene or buckyball) has been named after him. The Buckminsterfullerene molecule, which consists of 60 carbon atoms, very closely resembles a spherical version of Fuller&#x27;s geodesic dome. The 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was given to Kroto, Curl, and Smalley for their discovery of the fullerene.

On July 12, 2004, the United States Post Office released a new commemorative stamp honoring R. Buckminster Fuller on the 50th anniversary of his patent for the geodesic dome and by the occasion of his 109th birthday. The stamp&#x27;s design replicated the January 10, 1964, cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

Fuller was the subject of two documentary films: &quot;The World of Buckminster Fuller&quot; (1971) and &quot;Buckminster Fuller: Thinking Out Loud&quot; (1996). Additionally, filmmaker Sam Green and the band Yo La Tengo collaborated on a 2012 &quot;live documentary&quot; about Fuller, &quot;The Love Song of R. Buckminster Fuller&quot;.

In June 2008, the Whitney Museum of American Art presented &quot;Buckminster Fuller: Starting with the Universe&quot;, the most comprehensive retrospective to date of his work and ideas. The exhibition traveled to the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago in 2009. It presented a combination of models, sketches, and other artifacts, representing six decades of the artist&#x27;s integrated approach to housing, transportation, communication, and cartography. It also featured the extensive connections with Chicago from his years spent living, teaching, and working in the city.

In 2009, a number of US companies decided to repackage spherical magnets and sell them as toys. One company, Maxfield &amp; Oberton, told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that they saw the product on YouTube and decided to repackage them as &quot;Buckyballs&quot;, because the magnets could self-form and hold together in shapes reminiscent of the Fuller inspired buckyballs. The buckyball toy launched at New York International Gift Fair in 2009 and sold in the hundreds of thousands, but by 2010 began to experience problems with toy safety issues and the company was forced to recall the packages that were labelled as toys.

In 2012, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art hosted &quot;The Utopian Impulse&quot; – a show about Buckminster Fuller&#x27;s influence in the Bay Area. Featured were concepts, inventions and designs for creating &quot;free energy&quot; from natural forces, and for sequestering carbon from the atmosphere. The show ran January through July.

== In popular culture ==
Fuller is quoted in &quot;The Tower of Babble&quot; from the musical &quot;Godspell&quot;: &quot;Man is a complex of patterns and processes.&quot;

Belgian rock band dEUS released the song &quot;The Architect&quot;, inspired by Fuller, on their 2008 album &quot;Vantage Point&quot;.

Indie band Driftless Pony Club titled their 2011 album &quot;Buckminster&quot; after Fuller. Each of the album&#x27;s songs is based upon his life and works.

The design podcast &quot;99% Invisible&quot; (2010–present) takes its title from a Fuller quote: &quot;Ninety-nine percent of who you are is invisible and untouchable.&quot;

Fuller is briefly mentioned in &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot; (2014) when Kitty Pryde is giving a lecture to a group of students regarding utopian architecture.

Robert Kiyosaki&#x27;s 2009 book &quot;Conspiracy of the Rich&quot; and 2015 book &quot;Second Chance&quot; both concern Kiyosaki&#x27;s interactions with Fuller as well as Fuller&#x27;s unusual final book, &quot;Grunch of Giants&quot;.

In &quot;The House of Tomorrow&quot; (2017), based on Peter Bognanni&#x27;s 2010 novel of the same name, Ellen Burstyn&#x27;s character is obsessed with Fuller and provides retro-futurist tours of her geodesic home that include videos of Fuller sailing and talking with Burstyn, who had in real life befriended Fuller.

In &quot;The Simpsons&#x27;&quot; Treehouse of Horror episode airing on October 29, 1992, a scan over Springfield graveyard reveals graves for American workmanship, Drexell&#x27;s class, slapstick, and Buckminster Fuller.

<text>William Boyd Watterson II (born July 5, 1958) is an American cartoonist who authored the comic strip &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot;. The strip was syndicated from 1985 to 1995. Watterson concluded &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; with a short statement to newspaper editors and his readers that he felt he had achieved all he could in the medium. Watterson is known for his negative views on comic syndication and licensing, his efforts to expand and elevate the newspaper comic as an art form, and his move back into private life after &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; ended. Watterson was born in Washington, D.C., and grew up in Chagrin Falls, Ohio. The suburban Midwestern United States setting of Ohio was part of the inspiration for the setting of &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot;. Watterson currently lives in Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

==Early life==
Bill Watterson was born on July 5, 1958, in Washington, D.C., to Kathryn Watterson (1933–2022) and James Godfrey Watterson (1932–2016). His father worked as a patent attorney. In 1965, six-year-old Watterson and his family moved to Chagrin Falls, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland. Watterson has a younger brother, Thomas Watterson.

Watterson drew his first cartoon at age eight and spent much time in his childhood alone, drawing and cartooning. This continued through his school years, during which time he discovered comic strips such as Walt Kelly&#x27;s &quot;Pogo&quot;, George Herriman&#x27;s &quot;Krazy Kat&quot;, and Charles M. Schulz&#x27;s &quot;Peanuts&quot; which subsequently inspired and influenced his desire to become a professional cartoonist. On one occasion when he was in fourth grade, he wrote a letter to Schulz, who responded, much to Watterson&#x27;s surprise. This made a big impression on him at the time. His parents encouraged him in his artistic pursuits. Later, they recalled him as a &quot;conservative child&quot; — imaginative, but &quot;not in a fantasy way&quot;, and certainly nothing like the character of Calvin that he later created. Watterson found avenues for his cartooning talents throughout primary and secondary school, creating high school-themed super hero comics with his friends and contributing cartoons and art to the school newspaper and yearbook.

After high school, Watterson attended Kenyon College, where he majored in political science. He had already decided on a career in cartooning but he felt studying political science would help him move into editorial cartooning. He continued to develop his art skills and during his sophomore year he painted Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;Creation of Adam&quot; on the ceiling of his dormitory room. He also contributed cartoons to the college newspaper, some of which included the original &quot;Spaceman Spiff&quot; cartoons. Watterson graduated from Kenyon in 1980 with a Bachelor of Arts degree.

Later, when Watterson was creating names for the characters in his comic strip, he decided on Calvin (after the Protestant reformer John Calvin) and Hobbes (after the political philosopher Thomas Hobbes), allegedly as a &quot;tip of the hat&quot; to Kenyon&#x27;s political science department. In &quot;The Complete Calvin and Hobbes&quot;, Watterson stated that Calvin was named for &quot;a 16th-century theologian who believed in predestination&quot;, and Hobbes for &quot;a 17th-century philosopher with a dim view of human nature&quot;.

==Career==

===Early work===
Watterson was inspired by the work of &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; political cartoonist Jim Borgman, a 1976 graduate of Kenyon College, and decided to try to follow the same career path as Borgman, who in turn offered support and encouragement to the aspiring artist. Watterson graduated in 1980 and was hired on a trial basis at the &quot;Cincinnati Post&quot;, a competing paper of the &quot;Enquirer&quot;. Watterson quickly discovered that the job was full of unexpected challenges which prevented him from performing his duties to the standards set for him. Not the least of these challenges was his unfamiliarity with the Cincinnati political scene, as he had never resided in or near the city, having grown up in the Cleveland area and attending college in central Ohio. The &quot;Post&quot; fired Watterson before his contract was up.

He then joined a small advertising agency and worked there for four years as a designer, creating grocery advertisements while also working on his own projects, including development of his own cartoon strip and contributions to &quot;Target: The Political Cartoon Quarterly&quot;.

As a freelance artist, Watterson has drawn other works for various merchandise, including album art for his brother&#x27;s band, calendars, clothing graphics, educational books, magazine covers, posters, and post cards.

===&quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; and rise to success===
Watterson has said that he works for personal fulfillment. As he told the graduating class of 1990 at Kenyon College, &quot;It&#x27;s surprising how hard we&#x27;ll work when the work is done just for ourselves.&quot; &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; was first published on November 18, 1985. In &quot;Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book&quot;, he wrote that his influences included &quot;Peanuts&quot;, &quot;Pogo&quot;, and &quot;Krazy Kat&quot;. Watterson wrote the introduction to the first volume of &quot;The Komplete Kolor Krazy Kat&quot;. Watterson&#x27;s style also reflects the influence of Winsor McCay&#x27;s &quot;Little Nemo in Slumberland&quot;.

Like many artists, Watterson incorporated elements of his life, interests, beliefs, and values into his work—for example, his hobby as a cyclist, memories of his own father&#x27;s speeches about &quot;building character&quot;, and his views on merchandising and corporations. Watterson&#x27;s cat Sprite very much inspired the personality and physical features of Hobbes.

Watterson spent much of his career trying to change the climate of newspaper comics. He believed that the artistic value of comics was being undermined, and that the space that they occupied in newspapers continually decreased, subject to arbitrary whims of shortsighted publishers. Furthermore, he opined that art should not be judged by the medium for which it is created (i.e., there is no &quot;high&quot; art or &quot;low&quot; art—just art).

Watterson wrote a foreword for &quot;FoxTrot.&quot; 

===Fight against merchandising his characters===
For years, Watterson battled against pressure from publishers to merchandise his work, something that he felt would cheapen his comic through compromising the act of creation or reading.

He refused to merchandise his creations on the grounds that displaying &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; images on commercially sold mugs, stickers, and T-shirts would devalue the characters and their personalities. Watterson said that Universal kept putting pressure on him and that he had signed his contract without fully perusing it because, as a new artist, he was happy just to find a syndicate willing to give him a chance (two other syndicates had previously turned him down). He added that the contract was so one-sided that, if Universal really wanted to, they could license his characters against his will, and could even fire him and continue &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; with a new artist. Watterson&#x27;s position eventually won out and he was able to renegotiate his contract so that he would receive all rights to his work, but later added that the licensing fight exhausted him and contributed to the need for a nine-month sabbatical in 1991.

Despite Watterson&#x27;s efforts, many unofficial knockoffs have been found, including items that depict Calvin and Hobbes consuming alcohol or Calvin urinating on a logo. Watterson has said, &quot;Only thieves and vandals have made money on &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; merchandise.&quot;

===Changing the format of the Sunday strip===
Watterson was critical of the prevailing format for the Sunday comic strip that was in place when he began drawing (and remained so, to varying degrees). The typical layout consists of three rows with eight total squares, which take up half a page if published with its normal size. Some newspapers are restricted with space for their Sunday features and reduce the size of the strip. One of the more common ways is to cut out the top two panels, which Watterson believed forced him to waste the space on throwaway jokes that did not always fit the strip. 

While he was set to return from his first sabbatical, Watterson discussed with his syndicate a new format for &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; that would enable him to use his space more efficiently and would almost require the papers to publish it as a half-page. Universal agreed that they would sell the strip as the half-page and nothing else, which garnered anger from papers and criticism for Watterson from both editors and some of his fellow cartoonists (whom he described as &quot;unnecessarily hot-tempered&quot;). Eventually, Universal compromised and agreed to offer papers a choice between the full half-page or a reduced-sized version to alleviate concerns about the size issue. Watterson conceded that this caused him to lose space in many papers, but he said that, in the end, it was a benefit because he felt that he was giving the papers&#x27; readers a better strip for their money and editors were free not to run &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; at their own risk. He added that he was not going to apologize for drawing a popular feature.

===End of &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot;===

On November 9, 1995, Watterson announced the end of &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; with the following letter to newspaper editors:

The last strip of &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; was published on December 31, 1995.

==After &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot;==
In the years since &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; was ended, many attempts have been made to contact Watterson. Both &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; and the &quot;Cleveland Scene&quot; sent reporters, in 1998 and 2003 respectively, but neither were able to make contact with the media-shy Watterson. Since 1995, Watterson has taken up painting, at one point drawing landscapes of the woods with his father. He has kept away from the public eye and shown no interest in resuming the strip, creating new works based on the strip&#x27;s characters, or embarking on new commercial projects, though he has published several &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; &quot;treasury collection&quot; anthologies. He does not sign autographs or license his characters. Watterson was once known to sneak autographed copies of his books onto the shelves of the Fireside Bookshop, a family-owned bookstore in his hometown of Chagrin Falls, Ohio. He ended this practice after discovering that some of the autographed books were being sold online for high prices.

Watterson rarely gives interviews or makes public appearances. His lengthiest interviews include the cover story in &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; No. 127 in February 1989, an interview that appeared in a 1987 issue of &quot;Honk Magazine&quot;, and one in a 2015 Watterson exhibition catalogue.

On December 21, 1999, a short piece was published in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, written by Watterson to mark the forthcoming retirement of &quot;Peanuts&quot; creator Charles M. Schulz.

Circa 2003, Gene Weingarten of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; sent Watterson the first edition of the &quot;Barnaby&quot; book as an incentive, hoping to land an interview. Weingarten passed the book to Watterson&#x27;s parents, along with a message, and declared that he would wait in his hotel for as long as it took Watterson to contact him. Watterson&#x27;s editor Lee Salem called the next day to tell Weingarten that the cartoonist would not be coming.

In 2004, Watterson and his wife Melissa bought a home in the Cleveland suburb of Cleveland Heights, Ohio. In 2005, they completed the move from their home in Chagrin Falls to their new residence.

In October 2005, Watterson answered 15 questions submitted by readers. In October 2007, he wrote a review of &quot;Schulz and Peanuts&quot;, a biography of Charles M. Schulz, in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;.

In 2008, he provided a foreword for the first book collection of Richard Thompson&#x27;s &quot;Cul de Sac&quot; comic strip. In April 2011, a representative for Andrews McMeel received a package from a &quot;William Watterson in Cleveland Heights, Ohio&quot; which contained a oil-on-board painting of &quot;Cul de Sac&quot; character Petey Otterloop, done by Watterson for the &quot;Team Cul de Sac&quot; fundraising project for Parkinson&#x27;s disease in honor of Richard Thompson, who was diagnosed in 2009. Watterson&#x27;s syndicate revealed that the painting was the first new artwork of his that the syndicate has seen since &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; ended in 1995.

In October 2009, Nevin Martell published a book called &quot;Looking for Calvin and Hobbes,&quot; which included a story about the author seeking an interview with Watterson. In his search he interviews friends, co-workers and family but never gets to meet the artist himself.

In early 2010, Watterson was interviewed by &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; on the 15th anniversary of the end of &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot;. Explaining his decision to discontinue the strip, he said,

In October 2013, the magazine &quot;Mental Floss&quot; published an interview with Watterson, only the second since the strip ended. Watterson again confirmed that he would not be revisiting &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot;, and that he was satisfied with his decision. He also gave his opinion on the changes in the comic-strip industry and where it would be headed in the future:

In 2013 the documentary &quot;Dear Mr. Watterson&quot;, exploring the cultural impact of &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot;, was released. Watterson himself did not appear in the film.

On February 26, 2014, Watterson published his first cartoon since the end of &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot;: a poster for the documentary &quot;Stripped&quot;.

In 2014, Watterson co-authored &quot;The Art of Richard Thompson&quot; with &quot;Washington Post&quot; cartoonist Nick Galifianakis and David Apatoff.

In June 2014, three strips of &quot;Pearls Before Swine&quot; (published June 4, June 5, and June 6, 2014) featured guest illustrations by Watterson after mutual friend Nick Galifianakis connected him and cartoonist Stephan Pastis, who communicated via e-mail. Pastis likened this unexpected collaboration to getting &quot;a glimpse of Bigfoot&quot;. &quot;I thought maybe Stephan and I could do this goofy collaboration and then use the result to raise some money for Parkinson&#x27;s research in honor of Richard Thompson. It seemed like a perfect convergence&quot;, Watterson told &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. The day that Stephan Pastis returned to his own strip, he paid tribute to Watterson by alluding to the final strip of &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; from December 31, 1995.

On November 5, 2014, a poster was unveiled, drawn by Watterson for the 2015 Angoulême International Comics Festival where he was awarded the Grand Prix in 2014.

On April 1, 2016, for April Fools&#x27; Day, Berkeley Breathed posted on Facebook that Watterson had signed &quot;the franchise over to my &#x27;administration&#x27;&quot;. He then posted a comic with Calvin, Hobbes, and Opus all featured. The comic is signed by Watterson, though the degree of his involvement was speculative. Breathed posted another &quot;Calvin County&quot; strip featuring Calvin and Hobbes, also &quot;signed&quot; by Watterson on April 1, 2017, along with a fake &quot;New York Times&quot; story ostensibly detailing the &quot;merger&quot; of the two strips. Berkeley Breathed included Hobbes in a November 27, 2017, strip as a stand-in for the character Steve Dallas. Hobbes has also returned in the June 9, 11, and 12, 2021, strips as a stand-in for Bill The Cat.

===Exhibitions===
In 2001, the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library &amp; Museum at Ohio State University mounted an exhibition of Watterson&#x27;s Sunday strips. He chose thirty-six of his favorites, displaying them with both the original drawing and the colored finished product, with most pieces featuring personal annotations. Watterson also wrote an accompanying essay that served as the foreword for the exhibit, called &quot;Calvin and Hobbes: Sunday Pages 1985–1995&quot;, which opened on September 10, 2001. It was taken down in January 2002. The accompanying published catalog had the same title.

From March 22 to August 3, 2014, Watterson exhibited again at the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library &amp; Museum at Ohio State University. In conjunction with this exhibition, Watterson also participated in an interview with the school. An exhibition catalog named &quot;Exploring Calvin and Hobbes&quot; was released with the exhibit. The book contained a lengthy interview with Bill Watterson, conducted by Jenny Robb, the curator of the museum.

===&quot;The Mysteries&quot;===
Watterson released his first published work in 28 years on October 10, 2023, called &quot;The Mysteries&quot;. It was an illustrated &quot;fable for grown-ups&quot; about &quot;what lies beyond human understanding&quot;. The work was a collaboration with the illustrator and caricaturist John Kascht.

==Awards and honors==
Watterson was awarded the National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s Reuben Award in both 1986 and 1988. Watterson&#x27;s second Reuben win made him the youngest cartoonist to be so honored, and only the sixth person to win twice, following Milton Caniff, Charles M. Schulz, Dik Browne, Chester Gould, and Jeff MacNelly. Gary Larson is the only cartoonist to win a second Reuben since Watterson. 

In 2014, Watterson was awarded the Grand Prix at the Angoulême International Comics Festival for his body of work, becoming just the fourth non-European cartoonist to be so honored in the first 41 years of the event.

<doc id="4035" wikidata="Q23445" url="?curid=4035" title="Black">
<text>Black is a color that results from the absence or complete absorption of visible light. It is an achromatic color, without chroma, like white and grey. It is often used symbolically or figuratively to represent darkness. Black and white have often been used to describe opposites such as good and evil, the Dark Ages versus the Age of Enlightenment, and night versus day. Since the Middle Ages, black has been the symbolic color of solemnity and authority, and for this reason it is still commonly worn by judges and magistrates.

Black was one of the first colors used by artists in Neolithic cave paintings. It was used in ancient Egypt and Greece as the color of the underworld. In the Roman Empire, it became the color of mourning, and over the centuries it was frequently associated with death, evil, witches, and magic. In the 14th century, it was worn by royalty, clergy, judges, and government officials in much of Europe. It became the color worn by English romantic poets, businessmen and statesmen in the 19th century, and a high fashion color in the 20th century. According to surveys in Europe and North America, it is the color most commonly associated with mourning, the end, secrets, magic, force, violence, fear, evil, and elegance.

Black is the most common ink color used for printing books, newspapers and documents, as it provides the highest contrast with white paper and thus is the easiest color to read. Similarly, black text on a white screen is the most common format used on computer screens. the darkest material is made by MIT engineers from vertically aligned carbon nanotubes.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;black&quot; comes from Old English &quot;blæc&quot; (&quot;black, dark&quot;, &quot;also&quot;, &quot;ink&quot;), from Proto-Germanic *&quot;blakkaz&quot; (&quot;burned&quot;), from Proto-Indo-European *&quot;bhleg-&quot; (&quot;to burn, gleam, shine, flash&quot;), from base *&quot;bhel-&quot; (&quot;to shine&quot;), related to Old Saxon &quot;blak&quot; (&quot;ink&quot;), Old High German &quot;blach&quot; (&quot;black&quot;), Old Norse &quot;blakkr&quot; (&quot;dark&quot;), Dutch &quot;blaken&quot; (&quot;to burn&quot;), and Swedish &quot;bläck&quot; (&quot;ink&quot;). More distant cognates include Latin &quot;flagrare&quot; (&quot;to blaze, glow, burn&quot;), and Ancient Greek &quot;phlegein&quot; (&quot;to burn, scorch&quot;). The Ancient Greeks sometimes used the same word to name different colors, if they had the same intensity. &quot;Kuanos&quot; could mean both dark blue and black. The Ancient Romans had two words for black: &quot;ater&quot; was a flat, dull black, while &quot;niger&quot; was a brilliant, saturated black. &quot;Ater&quot; has vanished from the vocabulary, but &quot;niger&quot; was the source of the country name &quot;Nigeria,&quot; the English word &quot;Negro&quot;, and the word for &quot;black&quot; in most modern Romance languages (French: &quot;noir&quot;; Spanish and Portuguese: &quot;negro&quot;; Italian: &quot;nero&quot;; Romanian: &quot;negru&quot;).

Old High German also had two words for black: &quot;swartz&quot; for dull black and &quot;blach&quot; for a luminous black. These are parallelled in Middle English by the terms &quot;swart&quot; for dull black and &quot;blaek&quot; for luminous black. &quot;Swart&quot; still survives as the word &quot;swarthy&quot;, while &quot;blaek&quot; became the modern English &quot;black&quot;. The former is cognate with the words used for black in most modern Germanic languages aside from English (German: &quot;schwarz&quot;, Dutch: &quot;zwart&quot;, Swedish: &quot;svart&quot;, Danish: &quot;sort&quot;, Icelandic: &quot;svartr&quot;). In heraldry, the word used for the black color is sable, named for the black fur of the sable, an animal.

==Art==
===Prehistoric===

Black was one of the first colors used in art. The Lascaux Cave in France contains drawings of bulls and other animals drawn by paleolithic artists between 18,000 and 17,000 years ago. They began by using charcoal, and later achieved darker pigments by burning bones or grinding a powder of manganese oxide.

===Ancient===

For the ancient Egyptians, black had positive associations; being the color of fertility and the rich black soil flooded by the Nile. It was the color of Anubis, the god of the underworld, who took the form of a black jackal, and offered protection against evil to the dead. To ancient Greeks, black represented the underworld, separated from the living by the river Acheron, whose water ran black. Those who had committed the worst sins were sent to Tartarus, the deepest and darkest level. In the center was the palace of Hades, the king of the underworld, where he was seated upon a black ebony throne. Black was one of the most important colors used by ancient Greek artists. In the 6th century BC, they began making black-figure pottery and later red figure pottery, using a highly original technique. In black-figure pottery, the artist would paint figures with a glossy clay slip on a red clay pot. When the pot was fired, the figures painted with the slip would turn black, against a red background. Later they reversed the process, painting the spaces between the figures with slip. This created magnificent red figures against a glossy black background.
In the social hierarchy of ancient Rome, purple was reserved for the emperor; red was the color worn by soldiers (red cloaks for the officers, red tunics for the soldiers); white the color worn by the priests, and black was worn by craftsmen and artisans. The black they wore was not deep and rich; the vegetable dyes used to make black were not solid or lasting, so the blacks often faded to gray or brown.

In Latin, the word for black, &quot;ater&quot; and to darken, &quot;atere&quot;, were associated with cruelty, brutality and evil. They were the root of the English words &quot;atrocious&quot; and &quot;atrocity&quot;. For the Romans, black symbolized death and mourning. In the 2nd century BC Roman magistrates wore a dark toga, called a &quot;toga pulla&quot;, to funeral ceremonies. Later, under the Empire, the family of the deceased also wore dark colors for a long period; then, after a banquet to mark the end of mourning, exchanged the black for a white toga. In Roman poetry, death was called the &quot;hora nigra&quot;, the black hour.

The German and Scandinavian peoples worshipped their own goddess of the night, Nótt, who crossed the sky in a chariot drawn by a black horse. They also feared Hel, the goddess of the kingdom of the dead, whose skin was black on one side and red on the other. They also held sacred the raven. They believed that Odin, the king of the Nordic pantheon, had two black ravens, Huginn and Muninn, who served as his agents, traveling the world for him, watching and listening.

===Postclassical===
In the early Middle Ages, black was commonly associated with darkness and evil. In Medieval paintings, the devil was usually depicted as having human form, but with wings and black skin or hair.

====12th and 13th centuries====
In fashion, black did not have the prestige of red, the color of the nobility. It was worn by Benedictine monks as a sign of humility and penitence. In the 12th century a famous theological dispute broke out between the Cistercian monks, who wore white, and the Benedictines, who wore black. A Benedictine abbot, Pierre the Venerable, accused the Cistercians of excessive pride in wearing white instead of black. Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, the founder of the Cistercians responded that black was the color of the devil, hell, &quot;of death and sin&quot;, while white represented &quot;purity, innocence and all the virtues&quot;.

Black symbolized both power and secrecy in the medieval world. The emblem of the Holy Roman Empire of Germany was a black eagle. The black knight in the poetry of the Middle Ages was an enigmatic figure, hiding his identity, usually wrapped in secrecy.

Black ink, invented in China, was traditionally used in the Middle Ages for writing, for the simple reason that black was the darkest color and therefore provided the greatest contrast with white paper or parchment, making it the easiest color to read. It became even more important in the 15th century, with the invention of printing. A new kind of ink, printer&#x27;s ink, was created out of soot, turpentine and walnut oil. The new ink made it possible to spread ideas to a mass audience through printed books, and to popularize art through black and white prints. Because of its contrast and clarity, black ink on white paper continued to be the standard for printing books, newspapers and documents; and for the same reason black text on a white background is the most common format used on computer screens.

====14th and 15th centuries====
In the early Middle Ages, princes, nobles and the wealthy usually wore bright colors, particularly scarlet cloaks from Italy. Black was rarely part of the wardrobe of a noble family. The one exception was the fur of the sable. This glossy black fur, from an animal of the marten family, was the finest and most expensive fur in Europe. It was imported from Russia and Poland and used to trim the robes and gowns of royalty.

In the 14th century, the status of black began to change. First, high-quality black dyes began to arrive on the market, allowing garments of a deep, rich black. Magistrates and government officials began to wear black robes, as a sign of the importance and seriousness of their positions. A third reason was the passage of sumptuary laws in some parts of Europe which prohibited the wearing of costly clothes and certain colors by anyone except members of the nobility. The famous bright scarlet cloaks from Venice and the peacock blue fabrics from Florence were restricted to the nobility. The wealthy bankers and merchants of northern Italy responded by changing to black robes and gowns, made with the most expensive fabrics.

The change to the more austere but elegant black was quickly picked up by the kings and nobility. It began in northern Italy, where the Duke of Milan and the Count of Savoy and the rulers of Mantua, Ferrara, Rimini and Urbino began to dress in black. It then spread to France, led by Louis I, Duke of Orleans, younger brother of King Charles VI of France. It moved to England at the end of the reign of King Richard II (1377–1399), where all the court began to wear black. In 1419–20, black became the color of the powerful Duke of Burgundy, Philip the Good. It moved to Spain, where it became the color of the Spanish Habsburgs, of Charles V and of his son, Philip II of Spain (1527–1598). European rulers saw it as the color of power, dignity, humility and temperance. By the end of the 16th century, it was the color worn by almost all the monarchs of Europe and their courts.

===Modern===

====16th and 17th centuries====

While black was the color worn by the Catholic rulers of Europe, it was also the emblematic color of the Protestant Reformation in Europe and the Puritans in England and America. John Calvin, Philip Melanchthon and other Protestant theologians denounced the richly colored and decorated interiors of Roman Catholic churches. They saw the color red, worn by the pope and his cardinals, as the color of luxury, sin, and human folly. In some northern European cities, mobs attacked churches and cathedrals, smashed the stained glass windows and defaced the statues and decoration. In Protestant doctrine, clothing was required to be sober, simple and discreet. Bright colors were banished and replaced by blacks, browns and grays; women and children were recommended to wear white.

In the Protestant Netherlands, Rembrandt used this sober new palette of blacks and browns to create portraits whose faces emerged from the shadows expressing the deepest human emotions. The Catholic painters of the Counter-Reformation, like Rubens, went in the opposite direction; they filled their paintings with bright and rich colors. The new Baroque churches of the Counter-Reformation were usually shining white inside and filled with statues, frescoes, marble, gold and colorful paintings, to appeal to the public. But European Catholics of all classes, like Protestants, eventually adopted a sober wardrobe that was mostly black, brown and gray.


In the second part of the 17th century, Europe and America experienced an epidemic of fear of witchcraft. People widely believed that the devil appeared at midnight in a ceremony called a Black Mass or black sabbath, usually in the form of a black animal, often a goat, a dog, a wolf, a bear, a deer or a rooster, accompanied by their familiar spirits, black cats, serpents and other black creatures. This was the origin of the widespread superstition about black cats and other black animals. In medieval Flanders, in a ceremony called &quot;Kattenstoet,&quot; black cats were thrown from the belfry of the Cloth Hall of Ypres to ward off witchcraft.

Witch trials were common in both Europe and America during this period. During the notorious Salem witch trials in New England in 1692–93, one of those on trial was accused of being able turn into a &quot;black thing with a blue cap,&quot; and others of having familiars in the form of a black dog, a black cat and a black bird. Nineteen women and men were hanged as witches.

====18th and 19th centuries====
In the 18th century, during the European Age of Enlightenment, black receded as a fashion color. Paris became the fashion capital, and pastels, blues, greens, yellow and white became the colors of the nobility and upper classes. But after the French Revolution, black again became the dominant color. Black was the color of the industrial revolution, largely fueled by coal, and later by oil. Thanks to coal smoke, the buildings of the large cities of Europe and America gradually turned black. By 1846 the industrial area of the West Midlands of England was &quot;commonly called &#x27;the Black Country&#x27;&quot;. Charles Dickens and other writers described the dark streets and smoky skies of London, and they were vividly illustrated in the wood-engravings of French artist Gustave Doré.
A different kind of black was an important part of the romantic movement in literature. Black was the color of melancholy, the dominant theme of romanticism. The novels of the period were filled with castles, ruins, dungeons, storms, and meetings at midnight. The leading poets of the movement were usually portrayed dressed in black, usually with a white shirt and open collar, and a scarf carelessly over their shoulder, Percy Bysshe Shelley and Lord Byron helped create the enduring stereotype of the romantic poet.
The invention of inexpensive synthetic black dyes and the industrialization of the textile industry meant that high-quality black clothes were available for the first time to the general population. In the 19th century black gradually became the most popular color of business dress of the upper and middle classes in England, the Continent, and America. Black dominated literature and fashion in the 19th century, and played a large role in painting. James McNeill Whistler made the color the subject of his most famous painting, &quot;Arrangement in grey and black number one&quot; (1871), better known as &quot;Whistler&#x27;s Mother&quot;.

Some 19th-century French painters had a low opinion of black: &quot;Reject black,&quot; Paul Gauguin said, &quot;and that mix of black and white they call gray. Nothing is black, nothing is gray.&quot; But Édouard Manet used blacks for their strength and dramatic effect. Manet&#x27;s portrait of painter Berthe Morisot was a study in black which perfectly captured her spirit of independence. The black gave the painting power and immediacy; he even changed her eyes, which were green, to black to strengthen the effect. Henri Matisse quoted the French impressionist Pissarro telling him, &quot;Manet is stronger than us all – he made light with black.&quot;

Pierre-Auguste Renoir used luminous blacks, especially in his portraits. When someone told him that black was not a color, Renoir replied: &quot;What makes you think that? Black is the queen of colors. I always detested Prussian blue. I tried to replace black with a mixture of red and blue, I tried using cobalt blue or ultramarine, but I always came back to ivory black.&quot;

Vincent van Gogh used black lines to outline many of the objects in his paintings, such as the bed in the famous painting of his bedroom. making them stand apart. His painting of black crows over a cornfield, painted shortly before he died, was particularly agitated and haunting. In the late 19th century, black also became the color of anarchism. (See the section political movements.)

====20th and 21st centuries====
In the 20th century, black was utilised by Italian and German fascism. (See the section political movements). In art, the colour regained some of the territory that it had lost during the 19th century. The Russian painter Kasimir Malevich, a member of the Suprematist movement, created the &quot;Black Square&quot; in 1915, is widely considered the first purely abstract painting. He wrote, &quot;The painted work is no longer simply the imitation of reality, but is this very reality ... It is not a demonstration of ability, but the materialization of an idea.&quot;

Black was appreciated by Henri Matisse. &quot;When I didn&#x27;t know what color to put down, I put down black,&quot; he said in 1945. &quot;Black is a force: I used black as ballast to simplify the construction ... Since the impressionists it seems to have made continuous progress, taking a more and more important part in color orchestration, comparable to that of the double bass as a solo instrument.&quot;

In the 1950s, black came to be a symbol of individuality and intellectual and social rebellion, the color of those who did not accept established norms and values. In Paris, it was worn by Left-Bank intellectuals and performers such as Juliette Gréco, and by some members of the Beat Movement in New York and San Francisco. Black leather jackets were worn by motorcycle gangs such as the Hells Angels and street gangs on the fringes of society in the United States. Black as a color of rebellion was celebrated in such films as &quot;The Wild One&quot;, with Marlon Brando. By the end of the 20th century, black was the emblematic color of the punk subculture punk fashion, and the goth subculture. Goth fashion, which emerged in England in the 1980s, was inspired by Victorian era mourning dress.

In men&#x27;s fashion, black gradually ceded its dominance to navy blue, particularly in business suits. Black evening dress and formal dress in general were worn less and less. In 1960, John F. Kennedy was the last American President to be inaugurated wearing formal dress; Lyndon Johnson and his successors were inaugurated wearing business suits.

Women&#x27;s fashion was revolutionized and simplified in 1926 by the French designer Coco Chanel, who published a drawing of a simple black dress in &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine. She famously said, &quot;A woman needs just three things; a black dress, a black sweater, and, on her arm, a man she loves.&quot; French designer Jean Patou also followed suit by creating a black collection in 1929. Other designers contributed to the trend of the little black dress. The Italian designer Gianni Versace said, &quot;Black is the quintessence of simplicity and elegance,&quot; and French designer Yves Saint Laurent said, &quot;black is the liaison which connects art and fashion. One of the most famous black dresses of the century was designed by Hubert de Givenchy and was worn by Audrey Hepburn in the 1961 film &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot;.

The American civil rights movement in the 1950s was a struggle for the political equality of African Americans. It developed into the Black Power movement in the early 1960s until the late 1980s, and the Black Lives Matter movement in the 2010s and 2020s. It also popularized the slogan &quot;Black is Beautiful&quot;.

==Science==

===Physics===

Black can be defined as the color perceived when no visible light reaches the eye. Pigments or dyes that absorb almost all light rather than reflect it back to the eye look black. A black pigment can, however, result from a combination of several pigments that collectively absorb all wavelengths of visible light. If appropriate proportions of three primary pigments are mixed, the result reflects so little light as to be called black. This provides two superficially opposite but actually complementary descriptions of black. Black is the color produced by the absorption of all wavelengths of visible light, or an exhaustive combination of multiple colors of pigment.
In physics, a black body is a perfect absorber of light, but, by a thermodynamic rule, it is also the best emitter. Thus, the best radiative cooling, out of sunlight, is by using black paint, though it is important that it be black (a nearly perfect absorber) in the infrared as well. In elementary science, far ultraviolet light is called &quot;black light&quot; because, while itself unseen, it causes many minerals and other substances to fluoresce.

Absorption of light is contrasted by transmission, reflection and diffusion, where the light is only redirected, causing objects to appear transparent, reflective or white respectively. A material is said to be black if most incoming light is absorbed equally in the material. Light (electromagnetic radiation in the visible spectrum) interacts with the atoms and molecules, which causes the energy of the light to be converted into other forms of energy, usually heat. This means that black surfaces can act as thermal collectors, absorbing light and generating heat (see Solar thermal collector).

As of September 2019, the darkest material is made from vertically aligned carbon nanotubes. The material was grown by MIT engineers and was reported to have a 99.995% absorption rate of any incoming light. This surpasses any former darkest materials including Vantablack, which has a peak absorption rate of 99.965% in the visible spectrum.

====Pigments====
The earliest pigments used by Neolithic man were charcoal, red ocher and yellow ocher. The black lines of cave art were drawn with the tips of burnt torches made of a wood with resin. Different charcoal pigments were made by burning different woods and animal products, each of which produced a different tone. The charcoal would be ground and then mixed with animal fat to make the pigment.
* &quot;Vine black&quot; was produced in Roman times by burning the cut branches of grapevines. It could also be produced by burning the remains of the crushed grapes, which were collected and dried in an oven. According to the historian Vitruvius, the deepness and richness of the black produced corresponded to the quality of the wine. The finest wines produced a black with a bluish tinge the color of indigo.

The 15th-century painter Cennino Cennini described how this pigment was made during the Renaissance in his famous handbook for artists: &quot;...there is a black which is made from the tendrils of vines. And these tendrils need to be burned. And when they have been burned, throw some water onto them and put them out and then mull them in the same way as the other black. And this is a lean and black pigment and is one of the perfect pigments that we use.&quot;

Cennini also noted that &quot;There is another black which is made from burnt almond shells or peaches and this is a perfect, fine black.&quot; Similar fine blacks were made by burning the pits of the peach, cherry or apricot. The powdered charcoal was then mixed with gum arabic or the yellow of an egg to make a paint.

Different civilizations burned different plants to produce their charcoal pigments. The Inuit of Alaska used wood charcoal mixed with the blood of seals to paint masks and wooden objects. The Polynesians burned coconuts to produce their pigment.
* &quot;Lamp black&quot; was used as a pigment for painting and frescoes, as a dye for fabrics, and in some societies for making tattoos. The 15th century Florentine painter Cennino Cennini described how it was made during the Renaissance: &quot;... take a lamp full of linseed oil and fill the lamp with the oil and light the lamp. Then place it, lit, under a thoroughly clean pan and make sure that the flame from the lamp is two or three fingers from the bottom of the pan. The smoke that comes off the flame will hit the bottom of the pan and gather, becoming thick. Wait a bit. take the pan and brush this pigment (that is, this smoke) onto paper or into a pot with something. And it is not necessary to mull or grind it because it is a very fine pigment. Re-fill the lamp with the oil and put it under the pan like this several times and, in this way, make as much of it as is necessary.&quot; This same pigment was used by Indian artists to paint the Ajanta Caves, and as dye in ancient Japan.
* &quot;Ivory black&quot;, also known as bone char, was originally produced by burning ivory and mixing the resulting charcoal powder with oil. The color is still made today, but ordinary animal bones are substituted for ivory.
* &quot;Mars black&quot; is a black pigment made of synthetic iron oxides. It is commonly used in water-colors and oil painting. It takes its name from Mars, the god of war and patron of iron.

====Dyes====
Good-quality black dyes were not known until the middle of the 14th century. The most common early dyes were made from bark, roots or fruits of different trees; usually walnuts, chestnuts, or certain oak trees. The blacks produced were often more gray, brown or bluish. The cloth had to be dyed several times to darken the color. One solution used by dyers was add to the dye some iron filings, rich in iron oxide, which gave a deeper black. Another was to first dye the fabric dark blue, and then to dye it black.

A much richer and deeper black dye was eventually found made from the oak apple or &quot;gall-nut&quot;. The gall-nut is a small round tumor which grows on oak and other varieties of trees. They range in size from 2–5 cm, and are caused by chemicals injected by the larva of certain kinds of gall wasp in the family Cynipidae. The dye was very expensive; a great quantity of gall-nuts were needed for a very small amount of dye. The gall-nuts which made the best dye came from Poland, eastern Europe, the near east and North Africa. Beginning in about the 14th century, dye from gall-nuts was used for clothes of the kings and princes of Europe.

Another important source of natural black dyes from the 17th century onwards was the logwood tree, or Haematoxylum campechianum, which also produced reddish and bluish dyes. It is a species of flowering tree in the legume family, Fabaceae, that is native to southern Mexico and northern Central America. The modern nation of Belize grew from 17th century English logwood logging camps.

Since the mid-19th century, synthetic black dyes have largely replaced natural dyes. One of the important synthetic blacks is Nigrosin, a mixture of synthetic black dyes (CI 50415, Solvent black 5) made by heating a mixture of nitrobenzene, aniline and aniline hydrochloride in the presence of a copper or iron catalyst. Its main industrial uses are as a colorant for lacquers and varnishes and in marker-pen inks.

====Inks====
The first known inks were made by the Chinese, and date back to the 23rd century B.C. They used natural plant dyes and minerals such as graphite ground with water and applied with an ink brush. Early Chinese inks similar to the modern inkstick have been found dating to about 256 BC at the end of the Warring States period. They were produced from soot, usually produced by burning pine wood, mixed with animal glue. To make ink from an inkstick, the stick is continuously ground against an inkstone with a small quantity of water to produce a dark liquid which is then applied with an ink brush. Artists and calligraphists could vary the thickness of the resulting ink by reducing or increasing the intensity and time of ink grinding. These inks produced the delicate shading and subtle or dramatic effects of Chinese brush painting.

India ink (or &quot;Indian ink&quot; in British English) is a black ink once widely used for writing and printing and now more commonly used for drawing, especially when inking comic books and comic strips. The technique of making it probably came from China. India ink has been in use in India since at least the 4th century BC, where it was called &quot;masi&quot;. In India, the black color of the ink came from bone char, tar, pitch and other substances.

The ancient Romans had a black writing ink they called &quot;atramentum librarium&quot;. Its name came from the Latin word &quot;atrare&quot;, which meant to make something black. (This was the same root as the English word &quot;atrocious&quot;.) It was usually made, like India ink, from soot, although one variety, called &quot;atramentum elephantinum&quot;, was made by burning the ivory of elephants.

Gall-nuts were also used for making fine black writing ink. Iron gall ink (also known as iron gall nut ink or oak gall ink) was a purple-black or brown-black ink made from iron salts and tannic acids from gall nut. It was the standard writing and drawing ink in Europe, from about the 12th century to the 19th century, and remained in use well into the 20th century.

===Astronomy===
* A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity prevents anything, including light, from escaping. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass will deform spacetime to form a black hole. Around a black hole there is a mathematically defined boundary called an event horizon that marks the point of no return. It is called &quot;black&quot; because it absorbs all the light that hits the horizon, reflecting nothing, just like a perfect black body in thermodynamics. Black holes of stellar mass are expected to form when very massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle. After a black hole has formed it can continue to grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings. By absorbing other stars and merging with other black holes, supermassive black holes of millions of solar masses may form. There is general consensus that supermassive black holes exist in the centers of most galaxies. Although a black hole itself is black, infalling material forms an accretion disk, one of the brightest types of object in the universe.
* Black-body radiation refers to the radiation coming from a body at a given temperature where all incoming energy (light) is converted to heat.
* Black sky refers to the appearance of space as one emerges from Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

====Why the night sky and space are black – Olbers&#x27; paradox====
The fact that outer space is black is sometimes called Olbers&#x27; paradox. In theory, because the universe is full of stars, and is believed to be infinitely large, it would be expected that the light of an infinite number of stars would be enough to brilliantly light the whole universe all the time. However, the background color of outer space is black. This contradiction was first noted in 1823 by German astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm Matthias Olbers, who posed the question of why the night sky was black.

The current accepted answer is that, although the universe may be infinitely large, it is not infinitely old. It is thought to be about 13.8 billion years old, so we can only see objects as far away as the distance light can travel in 13.8 billion years. Light from stars farther away has not reached Earth, and cannot contribute to making the sky bright. Furthermore, as the universe is expanding, many stars are moving away from Earth. As they move, the wavelength of their light becomes longer, through the Doppler effect, and shifts toward red, or even becomes invisible. As a result of these two phenomena, there is not enough starlight to make space anything but black.

The daytime sky on Earth is blue because light from the Sun strikes molecules in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere scattering light in all directions. Blue light is scattered more than other colors, and reaches the eye in greater quantities, making the daytime sky appear blue. This is known as Rayleigh scattering.

The nighttime sky on Earth is black because the part of Earth experiencing night is facing away from the Sun, the light of the Sun is blocked by Earth itself, and there is no other bright nighttime source of light in the vicinity. Thus, there is not enough light to undergo Rayleigh scattering and make the sky blue. On the Moon, on the other hand, because there is virtually no atmosphere to scatter the light, the sky is black both day and night. This also holds true for other locations without an atmosphere, such as Mercury.

===Biology===
==Culture==
In China, the color black is associated with water, one of the five fundamental elements believed to compose all things; and with winter, cold, and the direction north, usually symbolized by a black tortoise. It is also associated with disorder, including the positive disorder which leads to change and new life. When the first emperor of China Qin Shi Huang seized power from the Zhou dynasty, he changed the Imperial color from red to black, saying that black extinguished red. Only when the Han dynasty appeared in 206 BC was red restored as the imperial color.
In Japan, black is associated with mystery, the night, the unknown, the supernatural, the invisible and death. Combined with white, it can symbolize intuition. In 10th- and 11th-century Japan, it was believed that wearing black could bring misfortune. It was worn at court by those who wanted to set themselves apart from the established powers or who had renounced material possessions.

In Japan black can also symbolize experience, as opposed to white, which symbolizes naiveté. The black belt in martial arts symbolizes experience, while a white belt is worn by novices. Japanese men traditionally wear a black kimono with some white decoration on their wedding day.

Black is associated with depth in Indonesia, as well as the subterranean world, demons, disaster, and the left hand. When combined with white, however, it symbolizes harmony and equilibrium.

===Political movements===

==== Anarchism ====
Anarchism is a political philosophy, most popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which holds that governments and capitalism are harmful and undesirable. The symbols of anarchism was usually either a black flag or a black letter A. More recently it is usually represented with a bisected red and black flag, to emphasise the movement&#x27;s socialist roots in the First International. Anarchism was most popular in Spain, France, Italy, Ukraine and Argentina. There were also small but influential movements in the United States, Russia and many other countries all around the world.

==== Fascism ====
The Blackshirts () were Fascist paramilitary groups in Italy during the period immediately following World War I and until the end of World War II. The Blackshirts were officially known as the Voluntary Militia for National Security (&quot;Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale&quot;, or MVSN).

Inspired by the black uniforms of the Arditi, Italy&#x27;s elite storm troops of World War I, the Fascist Blackshirts were organized by Benito Mussolini as the military tool of his political movement. They used violence and intimidation against Mussolini&#x27;s opponents. The emblem of the Italian fascists was a black flag with fasces, an axe in a bundle of sticks, an ancient Roman symbol of authority. Mussolini came to power in 1922 through his March on Rome with the blackshirts.

Black was also adopted by Adolf Hitler and the Nazis in Germany. Red, white and black were the colors of the flag of the German Empire from 1870 to 1918. In &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, Hitler explained that they were &quot;revered colors expressive of our homage to the glorious past.&quot; Hitler also wrote that &quot;the new flag ... should prove effective as a large poster&quot; because &quot;in hundreds of thousands of cases a really striking emblem may be the first cause of awakening interest in a movement.&quot; The black swastika was meant to symbolize the Aryan race, which, according to the Nazis, &quot;was always anti-Semitic and will always be anti-Semitic.&quot; Several designs by a number of different authors were considered, but the one adopted in the end was Hitler&#x27;s personal design. Black became the color of the uniform of the SS, the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; or &quot;defense corps&quot;, the paramilitary wing of the Nazi Party, and was worn by SS officers from 1932 until the end of World War II.

The Nazis used a black triangle to symbolize anti-social elements. The symbol originates from Nazi concentration camps, where every prisoner had to wear one of the Nazi concentration camp badges on their jacket, the color of which categorized them according to &quot;their kind&quot;. Many Black Triangle prisoners were either mentally disabled or mentally ill. The homeless were also included, as were alcoholics, the Romani people, the habitually &quot;work-shy&quot;, prostitutes, draft dodgers and pacifists. More recently the black triangle has been adopted as a symbol in lesbian culture and by disabled activists.

Black shirts were also worn by the British Union of Fascists before World War II, and members of fascist movements in the Netherlands.

==== Patriotic resistance ====
The Lützow Free Corps, composed of volunteer German students and academics fighting against Napoleon in 1813, could not afford to make special uniforms and therefore adopted black, as the only color that could be used to dye their civilian clothing without the original color showing. In 1815 the students began to carry a red, black and gold flag, which they believed (incorrectly) had been the colors of the Holy Roman Empire (the imperial flag had actually been gold and black). In 1848, this banner became the flag of the German confederation. In 1866, Prussia unified Germany under its rule, and imposed the red, white and black of its own flag, which remained the colors of the German flag until the end of the Second World War. In 1949 the Federal Republic of Germany returned to the original flag and colors of the students and professors of 1815, which is the flag of Germany today.

=== Military ===

Black has been a traditional color of cavalry and armoured or mechanized troops. German armoured troops (Panzerwaffe) traditionally wore black uniforms, and even in others, a black beret is common. In Finland, black is the symbolic color for both armoured troops and combat engineers, and military units of these specialities have black flags and unit insignia.

The black beret and the color black is also a symbol of special forces in many countries. Soviet and Russian OMON special police and Russian naval infantry wear a black beret. A black beret is also worn by military police in the Canadian, Czech, Croatian, Portuguese, Spanish and Serbian armies.

The silver-on-black skull and crossbones symbol or Totenkopf and a black uniform were used by Hussars and Black Brunswickers, the German Panzerwaffe and the Nazi Schutzstaffel, and U.S. 400th Missile Squadron (crossed missiles), and continues in use with the Estonian Kuperjanov Battalion.

===Religion===
In Christian theology, black was the color of the universe before God created light. In many religious cultures, from Mesoamerica to Oceania to India and Japan, the world was created out of a primordial darkness. In the Bible the light of faith and Christianity is often contrasted with the darkness of ignorance and paganism.
In Christianity, the devil is often called the &quot;prince of darkness&quot;. The term was used in John Milton&#x27;s poem &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, published in 1667, referring to Satan, who is viewed as the embodiment of evil. It is an English translation of the Latin phrase &quot;princeps tenebrarum&quot;, which occurs in the &quot;Acts of Pilate&quot;, written in the fourth century, in the 11th-century hymn &quot;Rhythmus de die mortis&quot; by Pietro Damiani, and in a sermon by Bernard of Clairvaux from the 12th century. The phrase also occurs in &quot;King Lear&quot; by William Shakespeare (), Act III, Scene IV, l. 14:
&#x27;The prince of darkness is a gentleman.&quot;

Priests and pastors of the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Protestant churches commonly wear black, as do monks of the Benedictine Order, who consider it the color of humility and penitence.
* In Islam, black, along with green, plays an important symbolic role. It is the color of the Black Standard, the banner that is said to have been carried by the soldiers of Muhammad. It is also used as a symbol in Shi&#x27;a Islam (heralding the advent of the Mahdi), and the flag of followers of Islamism and Jihadism.
* In Hinduism, the goddess Kali, goddess of time and change, is portrayed with black or dark blue skin. wearing a necklace adorned with severed heads and hands. Her name means &quot;The black one&quot;. She destroys anger and passion according to Hindu mythology and her devotees are supposed to abstain from meat or intoxication. Kali does not eat meat, but it is the śāstra&#x27;s injunction that those who are unable to give up meat-eating, they may sacrifice one goat, not cow, one small animal before the goddess Kali, on amāvāsya (new moon) day, night, not day, and they can eat it.
* In Paganism, black represents dignity, force, stability, and protection. The color is often used to banish and release negative energies, or binding. An athame is a ceremonial blade often having a black handle, which is used in some forms of witchcraft.

===Sports===
* The national rugby union team of New Zealand is called the &quot;All Blacks&quot;, in reference to their black outfits, and the color is also shared by other New Zealand national teams such as the Black Caps (cricket) and the Kiwis (rugby league).
* Association football (soccer) referees traditionally wear all-black uniforms, however nowadays other uniform colors may also be worn.
* In auto racing, a black flag signals a driver to go into the pits.
* In baseball, &quot;the black&quot; refers to the batter&#x27;s eye, a blacked out area around the center-field bleachers, painted black to give hitters a decent background for pitched balls.
* A large number of teams have uniforms designed with black colors even when the team does not normally feature that color. Many feel the color sometimes imparts a psychological advantage in its wearers. Black is used by numerous professional and collegiate sports teams

===Idioms and expressions===

* In general, the Negro race of African origin is called &quot;Black&quot;, while the Caucasian race of European origin is called &quot;White&quot;.
* In the United States, &quot;Black Friday&quot; (the day after Thanksgiving Day, the fourth Thursday in November) is traditionally the busiest shopping day of the year. Many Americans are on holiday because of Thanksgiving, and many retailers open earlier and close later than normal, and offer special prices. The day&#x27;s name originated in Philadelphia sometime before 1961, and originally was used to describe the heavy and disruptive downtown pedestrian and vehicle traffic which would occur on that day. Later an alternative explanation began to be offered: that &quot;Black Friday&quot; indicates the point in the year that retailers begin to turn a profit, or are &quot;in the black&quot;, because of the large volume of sales on that day.
* &quot;In the black&quot; means profitable. Accountants originally used black ink in ledgers to indicate profit, and red ink to indicate a loss.
* Black Friday also refers to any particularly disastrous day on financial markets. The first Black Friday (1869), 24 September 1869, was caused by the efforts of two speculators, Jay Gould and James Fisk, to corner the gold market on the New York Gold Exchange.
* A blacklist is a list of undesirable persons or entities (to be placed on the list is to be &quot;blacklisted&quot;).

==Associations and symbolism==

In the West, black is commonly associated with mourning and bereavement, and usually worn at funerals and memorial services. In some traditional societies, for example in Greece and Italy, some widows wear black for the rest of their lives. In contrast, across much of Africa and parts of Asia like Vietnam, white is a color of mourning.

A &quot;black day&quot; (or week or month) usually refers to tragic date. The Romans marked &quot;fasti&quot; days with white stones and &quot;nefasti&quot; days with black. The term is often used to remember massacres. Black months include the Black September in Jordan, when large numbers of Palestinians were killed, and Black July in Sri Lanka, the killing of members of the Tamil population by the Sinhalese government. In the financial world, the term often refers to a dramatic drop in the stock market. For example, the Wall Street crash of 1929, the stock market crash on 29 October 1929, which marked the start of the Great Depression, is nicknamed Black Tuesday, and was preceded by Black Thursday, a downturn on 24 October the previous week.

In western popular culture, black has long been associated with evil and darkness. It is the traditional color of witchcraft and black magic.

Black is frequently used as a color of power, law and authority. In many countries judges and magistrates wear black robes. That custom began in Europe in the 13th and 14th centuries. Jurists, magistrates and certain other court officials in France began to wear long black robes during the reign of Philip IV of France (1285–1314), and in England from the time of Edward I (1271–1307). The custom spread to the cities of Italy at about the same time, between 1300 and 1320. The robes of judges resembled those worn by the clergy, and represented the law and authority of the King, while those of the clergy represented the law of God and authority of the church. Until the 20th century most police uniforms were black, until they were largely replaced by blue in France, the U.S. and other countries. In the United States, police cars are frequently Black and white. The riot control units of the Basque Autonomous Police in Spain are known as &quot;beltzak&quot; (&quot;blacks&quot;) after their uniform.

Black formal attire is still worn at many solemn occasions or ceremonies, from graduations to formal balls. Graduation gowns are copied from the gowns worn by university professors in the Middle Ages, which in turn were copied from the robes worn by judges and priests, who often taught at the early universities. The mortarboard hat worn by graduates is adapted from a square cap called a biretta worn by Medieval professors and clerics.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, many machines and devices, large and small, were painted black, to stress their functionality. These included telephones, sewing machines, steamships, railroad locomotives, and automobiles. The Ford Model T, the first mass-produced car, was available only in black from 1914 to 1926. Of means of transportation, only airplanes were rarely ever painted black.

The term &quot;Black&quot; is often used in the West to describe people whose skin is darker. In the United States, it is particularly used to describe African Americans. Black is also commonly used as a racial description in the United Kingdom, since ethnicity was first measured in the 2001 census. In Canada, census respondents can identify themselves as Black. In Brazil, the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) asks people to identify themselves as &quot;branco&quot; (white), &quot;pardo&quot; (brown), &quot;preto&quot; (black), or &quot;amarelo&quot; (yellow).
Black and white have often been used to describe opposites, particularly light and darkness and good and evil. In Medieval literature, the white knight usually represented virtue, the black knight something mysterious and sinister. In American westerns, the hero often wore a white hat, the villain a black hat. 
In philosophy and arguments, the issue is often described as black-and-white, meaning that the issue at hand is dichotomized (having two clear, opposing sides with no middle ground).
Black is commonly associated with secrecy.
* The Black Chamber was a term given to an office which secretly opened and read diplomatic mail and broke codes. Queen Elizabeth I had such an office, headed by her Secretary, Sir Francis Walsingham, which successfully broke the Spanish codes and broke up several plots against the Queen. In France a &quot;cabinet noir&quot; was established inside the French post office by Louis XIII to open diplomatic mail. It was closed during the French Revolution but re-opened under Napoleon I. The Habsburg Empire and Dutch Republic had similar black chambers.
* The United States created a secret peacetime Black Chamber, called the Cipher Bureau, in 1919. It was funded by the State Department and Army and disguised as a commercial company in New York. It successfully broke a number of diplomatic codes, including the code of the Japanese government. It was closed down in 1929 after the State Department withdrew funding, when the new Secretary of State, Henry Stimson, stated that &quot;Gentlemen do not read each other&#x27;s mail.&quot; The Cipher Bureau was the ancestor of the U.S. National Security Agency.
* A black project is a secret unacknowledged military project, such as Enigma Decryption during World War II, or a secret counter-narcotics or police sting operation.
* Black ops are covert operations carried out by a government, government agency or military.
* A black budget is a government budget that is allocated for classified or other secret operations of a nation. The black budget is an account expenses and spending related to military research and covert operations. The black budget is mostly classified due to security reasons.

Black is the color most commonly associated with elegance in Europe and the United States. Black first became a fashionable color for men in Europe in the 17th century, in the courts of Italy and Spain. In the 19th century, it was the fashion for men both in business and for evening wear. For women&#x27;s fashion, the defining moment was the invention of the simple black dress by Coco Chanel in 1926. Thereafter, a long black gown was used for formal occasions, while the simple black dress could be used for everything else. The expression &quot;X is the new black&quot; is a reference to the latest trend or fad that is considered a wardrobe basic for the duration of the trend, on the basis that black is always fashionable. The phrase has taken on a life of its own and has become a cliché.

<text>Bletchley Park is an English country house and estate in Bletchley, Milton Keynes (Buckinghamshire), that became the principal centre of Allied code-breaking during the Second World War. The mansion was constructed during the years following 1883 for the financier and politician Herbert Leon in the Victorian Gothic, Tudor and Dutch Baroque styles, on the site of older buildings of the same name.

During World War II, the estate housed the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS), which regularly penetrated the secret communications of the Axis Powers most importantly the German Enigma and Lorenz ciphers. The GC&amp;CS team of codebreakers included John Tiltman, Dilwyn Knox, Alan Turing, Harry Golombek, Gordon Welchman, Hugh Alexander, Donald Michie, Bill Tutte and Stuart Milner-Barry.

According to the official historian of British Intelligence, the &quot;Ultra&quot; intelligence produced at Bletchley shortened the war by two to four years, and without it the outcome of the war would have been uncertain. The team at Bletchley Park devised automatic machinery to help with decryption, culminating in the development of Colossus, the world&#x27;s first programmable digital electronic computer. Codebreaking operations at Bletchley Park came to an end in 1946 and all information about the wartime operations was classified until the mid-1970s.

After the war it had various uses including as a teacher-training college and local GPO headquarters. By 1990 the huts in which the codebreakers worked were being considered for demolition and redevelopment. The Bletchley Park Trust was formed in February 1992 to save large portions of the site from development.

More recently, Bletchley Park has been open to the public, featuring interpretive exhibits and huts that have been rebuilt to appear as they did during their wartime operations. It receives hundreds of thousands of visitors annually. The separate National Museum of Computing, which includes a working replica Bombe machine and a rebuilt Colossus computer, is housed in Block H on the site.

==History==
The site appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as part of the Manor of Eaton. Browne Willis built a mansion there in 1711, but after Thomas Harrison purchased the property in 1793 this was pulled down. It was first known as Bletchley Park after its purchase by the architect Samuel Lipscomb Seckham in 1877, who built a house there. The estate of was bought in 1883 by Sir Herbert Samuel Leon, who expanded the then-existing house into what architect Landis Gores called a &quot;maudlin and monstrous pile&quot; combining Victorian Gothic, Tudor, and Dutch Baroque styles. At his Christmas family gatherings there was a fox hunting meet on Boxing Day with glasses of sloe gin from the butler, and the house was always &quot;humming with servants&quot;. With 40 gardeners, a flower bed of yellow daffodils could become a sea of red tulips overnight. After the death of Herbert Leon in 1926, the estate continued to be occupied by his widow Fanny Leon (née Higham) until her death in 1937.

In 1938, the mansion and much of the site was bought by a builder for a housing estate, but in May 1938 Admiral Sir Hugh Sinclair, head of the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS or MI6), bought the mansion and of land for £6,000 (£ today) for use by GC&amp;CS and SIS in the event of war. He used his own money as the Government said they did not have the budget to do so.

A key advantage seen by Sinclair and his colleagues (inspecting the site under the cover of &quot;Captain Ridley&#x27;s shooting party&quot;) was Bletchley&#x27;s geographical centrality. It was almost immediately adjacent to Bletchley railway station, where the &quot;Varsity Line&quot; between Oxford and Cambridgewhose universities were expected to supply many of the code-breakersmet the main West Coast railway line connecting London, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow and Edinburgh. Watling Street, the main road linking London to the north-west (subsequently the A5) was close by, and high-volume communication links were available at the telegraph and telephone repeater station in nearby Fenny Stratford.

Bletchley Park was known as &quot;B.P.&quot; to those who worked there.
&quot;Station X&quot; (X = Roman numeral ten), &quot;London Signals Intelligence Centre&quot;, and &quot;Government Communications Headquarters&quot; were all cover names used during the war.
The formal posting of the many &quot;Wrens&quot;members of the Women&#x27;s Royal Naval Serviceworking there, was to HMS &quot;Pembroke V&quot;. Royal Air Force names of Bletchley Park and its outstations included RAF Eastcote, RAF Lime Grove and RAF Church Green. The postal address that staff had to use was &quot;Room 47, Foreign Office&quot;.

After the war, the Government Code &amp; Cypher School became the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), moving to Eastcote in 1946 and to Cheltenham in the 1950s. The site was used by various government agencies, including the GPO and the Civil Aviation Authority. One large building, block F, was demolished in 1987 by which time the site was being run down with tenants leaving.

In 1990 the site was at risk of being sold for housing development. However, Milton Keynes Council made it into a conservation area. Bletchley Park Trust was set up in 1991 by a group of people who recognised the site&#x27;s importance. The initial trustees included Roger Bristow, Ted Enever, Peter Wescombe, Dr Peter Jarvis of the Bletchley Archaeological &amp; Historical Society, and Tony Sale who in 1994 became the first director of the Bletchley Park Museums.

==Personnel==
Admiral Hugh Sinclair was the founder and head of GC&amp;CS between 1919 and 1938 with Commander Alastair Denniston being operational head of the organization from 1919 to 1942, beginning with its formation from the Admiralty&#x27;s Room 40 (NID25) and the War Office&#x27;s MI1b. Key GC&amp;CS cryptanalysts who moved from London to Bletchley Park included John Tiltman, Dillwyn &quot;Dilly&quot; Knox, Josh Cooper, Oliver Strachey and Nigel de Grey. These people had a variety of backgroundslinguists and chess champions were common, and Knox&#x27;s field was papyrology. The British War Office recruited top solvers of cryptic crossword puzzles, as these individuals had strong lateral thinking skills.

On the day Britain declared war on Germany, Denniston wrote to the Foreign Office about recruiting &quot;men of the professor type&quot;. Personal networking drove early recruitments, particularly of men from the universities of Cambridge and Oxford. Trustworthy women were similarly recruited for administrative and clerical jobs. In one 1941 recruiting stratagem, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; was asked to organise a crossword competition, after which promising contestants were discreetly approached about &quot;a particular type of work as a contribution to the war effort&quot;.

Denniston recognised, however, that the enemy&#x27;s use of electromechanical cipher machines meant that formally trained mathematicians would also be needed; Oxford&#x27;s Peter Twinn joined GC&amp;CS in February 1939; Cambridge&#x27;s Alan Turing and Gordon Welchman began training in 1938 and reported to Bletchley the day after war was declared, along with John Jeffreys. Later-recruited cryptanalysts included the mathematicians Derek Taunt, Jack Good, Bill Tutte, and Max Newman; historian Harry Hinsley, and chess champions Hugh Alexander and Stuart Milner-Barry. Joan Clarke was one of the few women employed at Bletchley as a full-fledged cryptanalyst.

When seeking to recruit more suitably advanced linguists, John Tiltman turned to Patrick Wilkinson of the Italian section for advice, and he suggested asking Lord Lindsay of Birker, of Balliol College, Oxford, S. W. Grose, and Martin Charlesworth, of St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, to recommend classical scholars or applicants to their colleges.

This eclectic staff of &quot;Boffins and Debs&quot; (scientists and debutantes, young women of high society) caused GC&amp;CS to be whimsically dubbed the &quot;Golf, Cheese and Chess Society&quot;. Among those who worked there and later became famous in other fields were historian Asa Briggs, politician Roy Jenkins and novelist Angus Wilson.
During a morale-boosting visit on 9 September 1941, Winston Churchill reportedly remarked to Denniston or Menzies: &quot;I told you to leave no stone unturned to get staff, but I had no idea you had taken me so literally.&quot; Six weeks later, having failed to get sufficient typing and unskilled staff to achieve the productivity that was possible, Turing, Welchman, Alexander and Milner-Barry wrote directly to Churchill. His response was &quot;Action this day make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this has been done.&quot;

After initial training at the Inter-Service Special Intelligence School set up by John Tiltman (initially at an RAF depot in Buckingham and later in Bedfordwhere it was known locally as &quot;the Spy School&quot;) staff worked a six-day week, rotating through three shifts: 4 p.m. to midnight, midnight to 8 a.m. (the most disliked shift), and 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., each with a half-hour meal break. At the end of the third week, a worker went off at 8 a.m. and came back at 4 p.m., thus putting in 16 hours on that last day. The irregular hours affected workers&#x27; health and social life, as well as the routines of the nearby homes at which most staff lodged. The work was tedious and demanded intense concentration; staff got one week&#x27;s leave four times a year, but some &quot;girls&quot; collapsed and required extended rest. Recruitment took place to combat a shortage of experts in Morse code and German.

In January 1945, at the peak of codebreaking efforts, nearly 10,000 personnel were working at Bletchley and its outstations. About three-quarters of these were women. Many of the women came from middle-class backgrounds and held degrees in the areas of mathematics, physics and engineering; they were given chance due to the lack of men, who had been sent to war. They performed calculations and coding and hence were integral to the computing processes. Among them were Eleanor Ireland, who worked on the Colossus computers and Ruth Briggs, a German scholar, who worked within the Naval Section.

The female staff in Dilwyn Knox&#x27;s section were sometimes termed &quot;Dilly&#x27;s Fillies&quot;. Knox&#x27;s methods enabled Mavis Lever (who married mathematician and fellow code-breaker Keith Batey) and Margaret Rock to solve a German code, the Abwehr cipher.

Many of the women had backgrounds in languages, particularly French, German and Italian. Among them were Rozanne Colchester, a translator who worked mainly for the Italian air forces Section, and Cicely Mayhew, recruited straight from university, who worked in Hut 8, translating decoded German Navy signals, as did Jane Fawcett (née Hughes) who decrypted a vital message concerning the German battleship &quot;Bismarck&quot; and after the war became an opera singer and buildings conservationist.

Alan Brooke (CIGS) in his secret wartime diary frequently refers to “intercepts”:

: 16 April 1942: &quot;Took lunch in car and went to see the organization for breaking down ciphers [Bletchley Park] – a wonderful set of professors and genii! I marvel at the work they succeed in doing.&quot;

: 28 June 1945: &quot;After lunch (with Andrew Cunningham (RN) and Sinclair (RAF) we went to “The Park” … I began by addressing some 400 of the workers who consist of all 3 services, both sexes, and civilians, They come from every sort of walk of life, professors, students, actors, dancers, mathematicians, electricians signallers, etc. I thanked them on behalf of the Chiefs of Staff and congratulated them on the results of their work. We then toured round the establishment and had tea before returning.&quot;

For a long time, the British Government failed to acknowledge the contributions the personnel at Bletchley Park had made. Their work achieved official recognition only in 2009.

==Secrecy==
Properly used, the German Enigma and Lorenz ciphers should have been virtually unbreakable, but flaws in German cryptographic procedures, and poor discipline among the personnel carrying them out, created vulnerabilities that made Bletchley&#x27;s attacks just barely feasible. These vulnerabilities, however, could have been remedied by relatively simple improvements in enemy procedures, and such changes would certainly have been implemented had Germany had any hint of Bletchley&#x27;s success. Thus the intelligence Bletchley produced was considered wartime Britain&#x27;s &quot;Ultra secret&quot;higher even than the normally highest classification and security was paramount.

All staff signed the Official Secrets Act (1939) and a 1942 security warning emphasised the importance of discretion even within Bletchley itself: &quot;Do not talk at meals. Do not talk in the transport. Do not talk travelling. Do not talk in the billet. Do not talk by your own fireside. Be careful even in your Hut ...&quot;

Nevertheless, there were security leaks. Jock Colville, the Assistant Private Secretary to Winston Churchill, recorded in his diary on 31 July 1941, that the newspaper proprietor Lord Camrose had discovered Ultra and that security leaks &quot;increase in number and seriousness&quot;. Without doubt, the most serious of these was that Bletchley Park had been infiltrated by John Cairncross, the notorious Soviet mole and member of the Cambridge Spy Ring, who leaked Ultra material to Moscow.

Despite the high degree of secrecy surrounding Bletchley Park during the Second World War, unique and hitherto unknown amateur film footage of the outstation at nearby Whaddon Hall came to light in 2020, after being anonymously donated to the Bletchley Park Trust. A spokesman for the Trust noted the film&#x27;s existence was all the more incredible because it was &quot;very, very rare even to have [still] photographs&quot; of the park and its associated sites.

== Early work ==
The first personnel of the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS) moved to Bletchley Park on 15 August 1939. The Naval, Military, and Air Sections were on the ground floor of the mansion, together with a telephone exchange, teleprinter room, kitchen, and dining room; the top floor was allocated to MI6. Construction of the wooden huts began in late 1939, and Elmers School, a neighbouring boys&#x27; boarding school in a Victorian Gothic redbrick building by a church, was acquired for the Commercial and Diplomatic Sections.

After the United States joined World War II, a number of American cryptographers were posted to Hut 3, and from May 1943 onwards there was close co-operation between British and American intelligence. (See 1943 BRUSA Agreement.) In contrast, the Soviet Union was never officially told of Bletchley Park and its activities, a reflection of Churchill&#x27;s distrust of the Soviets even during the US-UK-USSR alliance imposed by the Nazi threat.

The only direct enemy damage to the site was done 2021 November 1940 by three bombs probably intended for Bletchley railway station; Hut 4, shifted two feet off its foundation, was winched back into place as
work inside continued.

==Intelligence reporting==

Initially, when only a very limited amount of Enigma traffic was being read, deciphered non-Naval Enigma messages were sent from Hut 6 to Hut 3 which handled their translation and onward transmission. Subsequently, under Group Captain Eric Jones, Hut 3 expanded to become the heart of Bletchley Park&#x27;s intelligence effort, with input from decrypts of &quot;Tunny&quot; (Lorenz SZ42) traffic and many other sources. Early in 1942 it moved into Block D, but its functions were still referred to as Hut 3.

Hut 3 contained a number of sections: Air Section &quot;3A&quot;, Military Section &quot;3M&quot;, a small Naval Section &quot;3N&quot;, a multi-service Research Section &quot;3G&quot; and a large liaison section &quot;3L&quot;. It also housed the Traffic Analysis Section, SIXTA. An important function that allowed the synthesis of raw messages into valuable Military intelligence was the indexing and cross-referencing of information in a number of different filing systems. Intelligence reports were sent out to the Secret Intelligence Service, the intelligence chiefs in the relevant ministries, and later on to high-level commanders in the field.

Naval Enigma deciphering was in Hut 8, with translation in Hut 4. Verbatim translations were sent to the Naval Intelligence Division (NID) of the Admiralty&#x27;s Operational Intelligence Centre (OIC), supplemented by information from indexes as to the meaning of technical terms and cross-references from a knowledge store of German naval technology. Where relevant to non-naval matters, they would also be passed to Hut 3. Hut 4 also decoded a manual system known as the dockyard cipher, which sometimes carried messages that were also sent on an Enigma network. Feeding these back to Hut 8 provided excellent &quot;cribs&quot; for Known-plaintext attacks on the daily naval Enigma key.

==Listening stations==
Initially, a wireless room was established at Bletchley Park.
It was set up in the mansion&#x27;s water tower under the code name &quot;Station X&quot;, a term now sometimes applied to the codebreaking efforts at Bletchley as a whole. The &quot;X&quot; is the Roman numeral &quot;ten&quot;, this being the Secret Intelligence Service&#x27;s tenth such station. Due to the long radio aerials stretching from the wireless room, the radio station was moved from Bletchley Park to nearby Whaddon Hall to avoid drawing attention to the site.

Subsequently, other listening stationsthe Y-stations, such as the ones at Chicksands in Bedfordshire, Beaumanor Hall, Leicestershire (where the headquarters of the War Office &quot;Y&quot; Group was located) and Beeston Hill Y Station in Norfolkgathered raw signals for processing at Bletchley. Coded messages were taken down by hand and sent to Bletchley on paper by motorcycle despatch riders or (later) by teleprinter.

==Additional buildings==
The wartime needs required the building of additional accommodation.

===Huts===

Often a hut&#x27;s number became so strongly associated with the work performed inside that even when the work was moved to another building it was still referred to by the original &quot;Hut&quot; designation.
* &quot;Hut 1&quot;: The first hut, built in 1939 used to house the Wireless Station for a short time, later administrative functions such as transport, typing, and Bombe maintenance. The first Bombe, &quot;Victory&quot;, was initially housed here.
* &quot;Hut 2&quot;: A recreational hut for &quot;beer, tea, and relaxation&quot;.
* &quot;Hut 3&quot;: Intelligence: translation and analysis of Army and Air Force decrypts
* &quot;Hut 4&quot;: Naval intelligence: analysis of Naval Enigma and Hagelin decrypts
* &quot;Hut 5&quot;: Military intelligence including Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese ciphers and German police codes.
* &quot;Hut 6&quot;: Cryptanalysis of Army and Air Force Enigma
* &quot;Hut 7&quot;: Cryptanalysis of Japanese naval codes and intelligence.
* &quot;Hut 8&quot;: Cryptanalysis of Naval Enigma.
* &quot;Hut 9&quot;: ISOS (Intelligence Section Oliver Strachey).
* &quot;Hut 10&quot;: Secret Intelligence Service (SIS or MI6) codes, Air and Meteorological sections.
* &quot;Hut 11&quot;: Bombe building.
* &quot;Hut 14&quot;: Communications centre.
* &quot;Hut 15&quot;: SIXTA (Signals Intelligence and Traffic Analysis).
* &quot;Hut 16&quot;: ISK (Intelligence Service Knox) Abwehr ciphers.
* &quot;Hut 18&quot;: ISOS (Intelligence Section Oliver Strachey).

* &quot;Hut 23&quot;: Primarily used to house the engineering department. After February 1943, Hut 3 was renamed Hut 23.

===Blocks===
In addition to the wooden huts, there were a number of brick-built &quot;blocks&quot;.
* &quot;Block A&quot;: Naval Intelligence.
* &quot;Block B&quot;: Italian Air and Naval, and Japanese code breaking.
* &quot;Block C&quot;: Stored the substantial punch-card indexes.
* &quot;Block D&quot;: From February 1943 it housed those from Hut 3, who synthesised intelligence from multiple sources, Huts 6 and 8 and SIXTA.
* &quot;Block E&quot;: Incoming and outgoing Radio Transmission and TypeX.
* &quot;Block F&quot;: Included the Newmanry and Testery, and Japanese Military Air Section. It has since been demolished.
* &quot;Block G&quot;: Traffic analysis and deception operations.
* &quot;Block H&quot;: &quot;Tunny&quot; and Colossus (now The National Museum of Computing).

==Work on specific countries&#x27; signals==

===German signals===
Most German messages decrypted at Bletchley were produced by one or another version of the Enigma cipher machine, but an important minority were produced by the even more complicated twelve-rotor Lorenz SZ42 on-line teleprinter cipher machine used for high command messages, known as Fish.

Five weeks before the outbreak of war, Warsaw&#x27;s Cipher Bureau revealed its achievements in breaking Enigma to astonished French and British personnel. The British used the Poles&#x27; information and techniques, and the Enigma clone sent to them in August 1939, which greatly increased their (previously very limited) success in decrypting Enigma messages.

The bombe was an electromechanical device whose function was to discover some of the daily settings of the Enigma machines on the various German military networks. Its pioneering design was developed by Alan Turing (with an important contribution from Gordon Welchman) and the machine was engineered by Harold &#x27;Doc&#x27; Keen of the British Tabulating Machine Company. Each machine was about high and wide, deep and weighed about a ton.

At its peak, GC&amp;CS was reading approximately 4,000 messages per day. As a hedge against enemy attack most bombes were dispersed to installations at Adstock and Wavendon (both later supplanted by installations at Stanmore and Eastcote), and Gayhurst.

Luftwaffe messages were the first to be read in quantity. The German navy had much tighter procedures, and the capture of code books was needed before they could be broken. When, in February 1942, the German navy introduced the four-rotor Enigma for communications with its Atlantic U-boats, this traffic became unreadable for a period of ten months. Britain produced modified bombes, but it was the success of the US Navy Bombe that was the main source of reading messages from this version of Enigma for the rest of the war. Messages were sent to and fro across the Atlantic by enciphered teleprinter links.

The Lorenz messages were codenamed &quot;Tunny&quot; at Bletchley Park. They were only sent in quantity from mid-1942. The Tunny networks were used for high-level messages between German High Command and field commanders. With the help of German operator errors, the cryptanalysts in the Testery (named after Ralph Tester, its head) worked out the logical structure of the machine despite not knowing its physical form. They devised automatic machinery to help with decryption, which culminated in Colossus, the world&#x27;s first programmable digital electronic computer. This was designed and built by Tommy Flowers and his team at the Post Office Research Station at Dollis Hill. The prototype first worked in December 1943, was delivered to Bletchley Park in January and first worked operationally on 5 February 1944. Enhancements were developed for the Mark 2 Colossus, the first of which was working at Bletchley Park on the morning of 1 June in time for D-day. Flowers then produced one Colossus a month for the rest of the war, making a total of ten with an eleventh part-built. The machines were operated mainly by Wrens in a section named the Newmanry after its head Max Newman.

Bletchley&#x27;s work was essential to defeating the U-boats in the Battle of the Atlantic, and to the British naval victories in the Battle of Cape Matapan and the Battle of North Cape. In 1941, Ultra exerted a powerful effect on the North African desert campaign against German forces under General Erwin Rommel. General Sir Claude Auchinleck wrote that were it not for Ultra, &quot;Rommel would have certainly got through to Cairo&quot;. While not changing the events, &quot;Ultra&quot; decrypts featured prominently in the story of Operation SALAM, László Almásy&#x27;s mission across the desert behind Allied lines in 1942. Prior to the Normandy landings on D-Day in June 1944, the Allies knew the locations of all but two of Germany&#x27;s fifty-eight Western-front divisions.
===Italian signals===

Italian signals had been of interest since Italy&#x27;s attack on Abyssinia in 1935.
During the Spanish Civil War the Italian Navy used the K model of the commercial Enigma without a plugboard; this was solved by Knox in 1937.
When Italy entered the war in 1940 an improved version of the machine was used, though little traffic was sent by it and there were &quot;wholesale changes&quot; in Italian codes and cyphers.

Knox was given a new section for work on Enigma variations, which he staffed with women (&quot;Dilly&#x27;s girls&quot;), who included Margaret Rock, Jean Perrin, Clare Harding, Rachel Ronald, Elisabeth Granger; and Mavis Lever.
Mavis Lever solved the signals revealing the Italian Navy&#x27;s operational plans before the Battle of Cape Matapan in 1941, leading to a British victory.

Although most Bletchley staff did not know the results of their work, Admiral Cunningham visited Bletchley in person a few weeks later to congratulate them.

On entering World War II in June 1940, the Italians were using book codes for most of their military messages. The exception was the Italian Navy, which after the Battle of Cape Matapan started using the C-38 version of the Boris Hagelin rotor-based cipher machine, particularly to route their navy and merchant marine convoys to the conflict in North Africa. As a consequence, JRM Butler recruited his former student Bernard Willson to join a team with two others in Hut 4. In June 1941, Willson became the first of the team to decode the Hagelin system, thus enabling military commanders to direct the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force to sink enemy ships carrying supplies from Europe to Rommel&#x27;s Afrika Korps. This led to increased shipping losses and, from reading the intercepted traffic, the team learnt that between May and September 1941 the stock of fuel for the Luftwaffe in North Africa reduced by 90 per cent.
After an intensive language course, in March 1944 Willson switched to Japanese language-based codes.

A Middle East Intelligence Centre (MEIC) was set up in Cairo in 1939. When Italy entered the war in June 1940, delays in forwarding intercepts to Bletchley via congested radio links resulted in cryptanalysts being sent to Cairo. A Combined Bureau Middle East (CBME) was set up in November, though the Middle East authorities made &quot;increasingly bitter complaints&quot; that GC&amp;CS was giving too little priority to work on Italian cyphers. However, the principle of concentrating high-grade cryptanalysis at Bletchley was maintained. John Chadwick started cryptanalysis work in 1942 on Italian signals at the naval base &#x27;HMS Nile&#x27; in Alexandria. Later, he was with GC&amp;CS; in the Heliopolis Museum, Cairo and then in the Villa Laurens, Alexandria.

===Soviet signals===
Soviet signals had been studied since the 1920s. In 193940, John Tiltman (who had worked on Russian Army traffic from 1930) set up two Russian sections at Wavendon (a country house near Bletchley) and at Sarafand in Palestine. Two Russian high-grade army and navy systems were broken early in 1940. Tiltman spent two weeks in Finland, where he obtained Russian traffic from Finland and Estonia in exchange for radio equipment. In June 1941, when the Soviet Union became an ally, Churchill ordered a halt to intelligence operations against it. In December 1941, the Russian section was closed down, but in late summer 1943 or late 1944, a small GC&amp;CS Russian cypher section was set up in London overlooking Park Lane, then in Sloane Square.

===Japanese signals===
An outpost of the Government Code and Cypher School had been set up in Hong Kong in 1935, the Far East Combined Bureau (FECB). The FECB naval staff moved in 1940 to Singapore, then Colombo, Ceylon, then Kilindini, Mombasa, Kenya. They succeeded in deciphering Japanese codes with a mixture of skill and good fortune. The Army and Air Force staff went from Singapore to the Wireless Experimental Centre at Delhi, India.

In early 1942, a six-month crash course in Japanese, for 20 undergraduates from Oxford and Cambridge, was started by the Inter-Services Special Intelligence School in Bedford, in a building across from the main Post Office. This course was repeated every six months until war&#x27;s end. Most of those completing these courses worked on decoding Japanese naval messages in Hut 7, under John Tiltman.

By mid-1945, well over 100 personnel were involved with this operation, which co-operated closely with the FECB and the US Signal intelligence Service at Arlington Hall, Virginia. In 1999, Michael Smith wrote that: &quot;Only now are the British codebreakers (like John Tiltman, Hugh Foss, and Eric Nave) beginning to receive the recognition they deserve for breaking Japanese codes and cyphers&quot;.

==Postwar==

===Continued secrecy===
After the War, the secrecy imposed on Bletchley staff remained in force, so that most relatives never knew more than that a child, spouse, or parent had done some kind of secret war work. Churchill referred to the Bletchley staff as &quot;the geese that laid the golden eggs and never cackled&quot;. That said, occasional mentions of the work performed at Bletchley Park slipped the censor&#x27;s net and appeared in print.

With the publication of F. W. Winterbotham&#x27;s &quot;The Ultra Secret&quot; (1974) public discussion of Bletchley Park&#x27;s work finally became possible, although some former staff considered themselves bound to silence forever.

Professor Brian Randell was researching the history of computer science in Britain in 1975–76 for a conference on the history of computing held at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, New Mexico on 10–15 June 1976, and received permission to present a paper on wartime development of the Colossi at the Post Office Research Station, Dollis Hill. (In October 1975 the British Government had released a series of captioned photographs from the Public Record Office.) The interest in the &quot;revelations&quot; in his paper resulted in a special evening meeting when Randell and Coombs answered further questions. Coombs later wrote that &quot;no member of our team could ever forget the fellowship, the sense of purpose and, above all, the breathless excitement of those days&quot;. In 1977 Randell published an article &quot;The First Electronic Computer&quot; in several journals.

In July 2009 the British government announced that Bletchley personnel would be recognised with a commemorative badge.

===Site===
After the war, the site passed through a succession of hands and saw a number of uses, including as a teacher-training college and local GPO headquarters. By 1991, the site was nearly empty and the buildings were at risk of demolition for redevelopment.

In February 1992, the Milton Keynes Borough Council declared most of the Park a conservation area, and the Bletchley Park Trust was formed to maintain the site as a museum. The site opened to visitors in 1993, and was formally inaugurated by the Duke of Kent as Chief Patron in July 1994. In 1999 the land owners, the Property Advisors to the Civil Estate and BT, granted a lease to the Trust giving it control over most of the site.

==Heritage attraction==
June 2014 saw the completion of an £8 million restoration project by museum design specialist, Event Communications, which was marked by a visit from Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. The Duchess&#x27; paternal grandmother, Valerie, and Valerie&#x27;s twin sister, Mary (&quot;née&quot; Glassborow), both worked at Bletchley Park during the war. The twin sisters worked as Foreign Office Civilians in Hut 6, where they managed the interception of enemy and neutral diplomatic signals for decryption. Valerie married Catherine&#x27;s grandfather, Captain Peter Middleton. A memorial at Bletchley Park commemorates Mary and Valerie Middleton&#x27;s work as code-breakers.

===Learning Department===

The Bletchley Park Learning Department offers educational group visits with active learning activities for schools and universities. Visits can be booked in advance during term time, where students can engage with the history of Bletchley Park and understand its wider relevance for computer history and national security. Their workshops cover introductions to codebreaking, cyber security and the story of Enigma and Lorenz.

==Funding==
In October 2005, American billionaire Sidney Frank donated £500,000 to Bletchley Park Trust to fund a new Science Centre dedicated to Alan Turing. Simon Greenish joined as Director in 2006 to lead the fund-raising effort in a post he held until 2012 when Iain Standen took over the leadership role. In July 2008, a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; from more than a hundred academics condemned the neglect of the site. In September 2008, PGP, IBM and other technology firms announced a fund-raising campaign to repair the facility. On 6 November 2008 it was announced that English Heritage would donate £300,000 to help maintain the buildings at Bletchley Park, and that they were in discussions regarding the donation of a further £600,000.

In October 2011, the Bletchley Park Trust received a £4.6 million Heritage Lottery Fund grant to be used &quot;to complete the restoration of the site, and to tell its story to the highest modern standards&quot; on the condition that £1.7 million of match funding is raised by the Bletchley Park Trust. Just weeks later, Google contributed £550,000 and by June 2012 the trust had successfully raised £2.4 million to unlock the grants to restore Huts 3 and 6, as well as develop its exhibition centre in Block C.

Additional income is raised by renting Block H to the National Museum of Computing, and some office space in various parts of the park to private firms.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the Trust expected to lose more than £2 million in 2020 and be required to cut a third of its workforce. Former MP John Leech asked Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft to donate £400,000 each to secure the future of the Trust. Leech had led the successful campaign to pardon Alan Turing and implement Turing&#x27;s Law.

==Other organisations sharing the campus==

===The National Museum of Computing===

The National Museum of Computing is housed in Block H, which is rented from the Bletchley Park Trust. Its Colossus and Tunny galleries tell an important part of allied breaking of German codes during World War II. There is a working reconstruction of a Bombe and a rebuilt Colossus computer which was used on the high-level Lorenz cipher, codenamed &quot;Tunny&quot; by the British.

The museum, which opened in 2007, is an independent voluntary organisation that is governed by its own board of trustees. Its aim is &quot;To collect and restore computer systems particularly those developed in Britain and to enable people to explore that collection for inspiration, learning and enjoyment.&quot; Through its many exhibits, the museum displays the story of computing through the mainframes of the 1960s and 1970s, and the rise of personal computing in the 1980s. It has a policy of having as many of the exhibits as possible in full working order.

===Science and Innovation Centre===
This consisted of serviced office accommodation housed in Bletchley Park&#x27;s Blocks A and E, and the upper floors of the Mansion. Its aim was to foster the growth and development of dynamic knowledge-based start-ups and other businesses. It closed in 2021 and blocks A and E were taken into use as part of the museum.

===Proposed National College of Cyber Security===
In April 2020 Bletchley Park Capital Partners, a private company run by Tim Reynolds, Deputy Chairman of the National Museum of Computing, announced plans to sell off the freehold to part of the site containing former Block G for commercial development. Offers of between £4 million and £6 million were reportedly being sought for the 3 acre plot, for which planning permission for employment purposes was granted in 2005. Previously, the construction of a National College of Cyber Security for students aged from 16 to 19 years old had been envisaged on the site, to be housed in Block G after renovation with funds supplied by the Bletchley Park Science and Innovation Centre.

===RSGB National Radio Centre===
The Radio Society of Great Britain&#x27;s National Radio Centre (including a library, radio station, museum and bookshop) are in a newly constructed building close to the main Bletchley Park entrance.

==Final recognition==
Not until July 2009 did the British government fully acknowledge the contribution of the many people working for the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS) at Bletchley. Only then was a commemorative medal struck to be presented to those involved. The gilded medal bears the inscription &quot;GC&amp;CS 1939–1945 Bletchley Park and its Outstations&quot;.

==In popular culture==
===Literature===
* Bletchley featured heavily in Robert Harris&#x27; novel &quot;Enigma&quot; (1995).
* A fictionalised version of Bletchley Park is featured in Neal Stephenson&#x27;s novel &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; (1999).
* Bletchley Park plays a significant role in Connie Willis&#x27; novel &quot;All Clear&quot; (2010).
* The Agatha Christie novel &quot;N or M?&quot;, published in 1941, was about spies during the Second World War and featured a character called Major Bletchley. Christie was friends with one of the code-breakers at Bletchley Park, and MI5 thought that the character name might have been a joke indicating that she knew what was happening there. It turned out to be a coincidence.
*Bletchley Park is the setting of Kate Quinn&#x27;s 2021 historical fiction novel, &quot;The Rose Code&quot;. Quinn used the likenesses of true veterans of Bletchley Park as inspiration for her story of three women who worked in some of the different areas at Bletchley Park.

===Film===
* The film &quot;Enigma&quot; (2001), which was based upon Robert Harris&#x27;s book and starred Kate Winslet, Saffron Burrows and Dougray Scott, is set in part in Bletchley Park.
* The film &quot;The Imitation Game&quot; (2014), starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Alan Turing, is set in Bletchley Park, and was partially filmed there.

===Radio===
* The radio show &quot;Hut 33&quot; is a situation comedy set in the fictional 33rd Hut of Bletchley Park.
* The Big Finish Productions &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio &quot;Criss-Cross&quot;, released in September 2015, features the Sixth Doctor working undercover in Bletchley Park to decode a series of strange alien signals that have hindered his TARDIS, the audio also depicting his first meeting with his new companion Constance Clarke.
* The Bletchley Park Podcast began in August 2012, with new episodes being released approximately monthly. It features stories told by the codebreakers, staff and volunteers, audio from events and reports on the development of Bletchley Park.

===Television===
* The 1979 ITV television serial &quot;Danger UXB&quot; features the character Steven Mount, a codebreaker at Bletchley who is driven to a nervous breakdown (and eventual suicide) by the stressful and repetitive nature of the work.
* In the TV series &quot;Foyle&#x27;s War&quot;, Adam Wainwright (Samantha Stewart&#x27;s fiancé, then husband) is a former Bletchley Park codebreaker.
* The Second World War code-breaking sitcom pilot &quot;Satsuma &amp; Pumpkin&quot; was recorded at Bletchley Park in 2003 and featured Bob Monkhouse in his last screen role. The BBC declined to produce the show and develop it further before creating effectively the same show on Radio 4 several years later, featuring some of the same cast, entitled &quot;Hut 33&quot;.
* Bletchley came to wider public attention with the documentary series &quot;Station X&quot; (1999).
* The 2012 ITV programme &quot;The Bletchley Circle&quot; is a set of murder mysteries set in 1952 and 1953. The protagonists are four female former Bletchley codebreakers, who use their skills to solve crimes. The pilot episode&#x27;s opening scene was filmed on-site, and the set was asked to remain there for its close adaptation of historiography.
*The 2018 programme &quot;The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco&quot; is a spin-off of &quot;The Bletchley Circle&quot;. It takes place in San Francisco and features two characters from the original series. 
* Ian McEwan&#x27;s television play &quot;The Imitation Game&quot; (1980) concludes at Bletchley Park.
* Bletchley Park was featured in the sixth and final episode of the BBC TV documentary &quot;The Secret War&quot; (1977), presented and narrated by William Woodard. This episode featured interviews with Gordon Welchman, Harry Golombek, Peter Calvocoressi, F. W. Winterbotham, Max Newman, Jack Good, and Tommy Flowers.
* The &quot;Agent Carter&quot; season 2 episode &quot;Smoke &amp; Mirrors&quot; reveals that Agent Peggy Carter worked at Bletchley Park early in the war before joining the Strategic Scientific Reserve.

===Theatre===
* The play &quot;Breaking the Code&quot; (1986) is set at Bletchley Park.

==Location==

Bletchley Park is opposite Bletchley railway station. It is close to junctions 13 and 14 of the M1, about northwest of London.

<text>Bede (; ; 672/326 May 735), also known as Saint Bede, the Venerable Bede, and Bede the Venerable (), was an English monk, author and scholar. He was one of the most known writers during the Early Middle Ages, and his most famous work, &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;, gained him the title &quot;The Father of English History&quot;. He served at the monastery of St Peter and its companion monastery of St Paul in the Kingdom of Northumbria of the Angles.

Born on lands belonging to the twin monastery of Monkwearmouth–Jarrow in present-day Tyne and Wear, England, Bede was sent to Monkwearmouth at the age of seven and later joined Abbot Ceolfrith at Jarrow. Both of them survived a plague that struck in 686 and killed the majority of the population there. While Bede spent most of his life in the monastery, he travelled to several abbeys and monasteries across the British Isles, even visiting the archbishop of York and King Ceolwulf of Northumbria.

His theological writings were extensive and included a number of Biblical commentaries and other works of exegetical erudition. Another important area of study for Bede was the academic discipline of &quot;computus&quot;, otherwise known to his contemporaries as the science of calculating calendar dates. One of the more important dates Bede tried to compute was Easter, an effort that was mired in controversy. He also helped popularize the practice of dating forward from the birth of Christ (&quot;Anno Domini—&quot;in the year of our Lord), a practice which eventually became commonplace in medieval Europe. He is considered by many historians to be the most important scholar of antiquity for the period between the death of Pope Gregory I in 604 and the coronation of Charlemagne in 800.

In 1899, Pope Leo XIII declared him a Doctor of the Church. He is the only native of Great Britain to achieve this designation. Bede was moreover a skilled linguist and translator, and his work made the Latin and Greek writings of the early Church Fathers much more accessible to his fellow Anglo-Saxons, which contributed significantly to English Christianity. Bede&#x27;s monastery had access to an impressive library which included works by Eusebius, Orosius, and many others.

== Life ==
Almost everything that is known of Bede&#x27;s life is contained in the last chapter of his &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;, a history of the church in England. It was completed in about 731, and Bede implies that he was then in his fifty-ninth year, which would give a birth date in 672 or 673. A minor source of information is the letter by his disciple Cuthbert (not to be confused with the saint, Cuthbert, who is mentioned in Bede&#x27;s work) which relates Bede&#x27;s death. Bede, in the &quot;Historia&quot;, gives his birthplace as &quot;on the lands of this monastery&quot;. He is referring to the twin monasteries of Monkwearmouth and Jarrow, in modern-day Wearside and Tyneside respectively. There is also a tradition that he was born at Monkton, two miles from the site where the monastery at Jarrow was later built. Bede says nothing of his origins, but his connections with men of noble ancestry suggest that his own family was well-to-do. Bede&#x27;s first abbot was Benedict Biscop, and the names &quot;Biscop&quot; and &quot;Beda&quot; both appear in a list of the kings of Lindsey from around 800, further suggesting that Bede came from a noble family.

Bede&#x27;s name reflects West Saxon &quot;Bīeda&quot; (Anglian &quot;Bēda&quot;). It is an Old English short name formed on the root of &quot;bēodan&quot; &quot;to bid, command&quot;.
The name also occurs in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, s.a. 501, as &quot;Bieda&quot;, one of the sons of the Saxon founder of Portsmouth. The &quot;Liber Vitae&quot; of Durham Cathedral names two priests with this name, one of whom is presumably Bede himself. Some manuscripts of the &quot;Life of Cuthbert&quot;, one of Bede&#x27;s works, mention that Cuthbert&#x27;s own priest was named Bede; it is possible that this priest is the other name listed in the &quot;Liber Vitae&quot;.

At the age of seven, Bede was sent as a &quot;puer oblatus&quot; to the monastery of Monkwearmouth by his family to be educated by Benedict Biscop and later by Ceolfrith. Bede does not say whether it was already intended at that point that he would be a monk. It was fairly common in Ireland at this time for young boys, particularly those of noble birth, to be fostered out as an oblate; the practice was also likely to have been common among the Germanic peoples in England. Monkwearmouth&#x27;s sister monastery at Jarrow was founded by Ceolfrith in 682, and Bede probably transferred to Jarrow with Ceolfrith that year.

The dedication stone for the church has survived ; it is dated 23 April 685, and as Bede would have been required to assist with menial tasks in his day-to-day life it is possible that he helped in building the original church. In 686, plague broke out at Jarrow. The &quot;Life of Ceolfrith&quot;, written in about 710, records that only two surviving monks were capable of singing the full offices; one was Ceolfrith and the other a young boy, who according to the anonymous writer had been taught by Ceolfrith. The two managed to do the entire service of the liturgy until others could be trained. The young boy was almost certainly Bede, who would have been about 14.

When Bede was about 17 years old, Adomnán, the abbot of Iona Abbey, visited Monkwearmouth and Jarrow. Bede would probably have met the abbot during this visit, and it may be that Adomnán sparked Bede&#x27;s interest in the Easter dating controversy. In about 692, in Bede&#x27;s nineteenth year, Bede was ordained a deacon by his diocesan bishop, John, who was bishop of Hexham. The canonical age for the ordination of a deacon was 25; Bede&#x27;s early ordination may mean that his abilities were considered exceptional, but it is also possible that the minimum age requirement was often disregarded. There might have been minor orders ranking below a deacon; but there is no record of whether Bede held any of these offices. In Bede&#x27;s thirtieth year (about 702), he became a priest, with the ordination again performed by Bishop John.

In about 701 Bede wrote his first works, the &quot;De Arte Metrica&quot; and &quot;De Schematibus et Tropis&quot;; both were intended for use in the classroom. He continued to write for the rest of his life, eventually completing over 60 books, most of which have survived. Not all his output can be easily dated, and Bede may have worked on some texts over a period of many years. His last surviving work is a letter to Ecgbert of York, a former student, written in 734. A 6th-century Greek and Latin manuscript of &quot;Acts of the Apostles&quot; that is believed to have been used by Bede survives and is now in the Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford. It is known as the Codex Laudianus.

Bede may have worked on some of the Latin Bibles that were copied at Jarrow, one of which, the Codex Amiatinus, is now held by the Laurentian Library in Florence. Bede was a teacher as well as a writer; he enjoyed music and was said to be accomplished as a singer and as a reciter of poetry in the vernacular. It is possible that he suffered a speech impediment, but this depends on a phrase in the introduction to his verse life of St Cuthbert. Translations of this phrase differ, and it is uncertain whether Bede intended to say that he was cured of a speech problem, or merely that he was inspired by the saint&#x27;s works.
In 708, some monks at Hexham accused Bede of having committed heresy in his work &quot;De Temporibus&quot;. The standard theological view of world history at the time was known as the Six Ages of the World; in his book, Bede calculated the age of the world for himself, rather than accepting the authority of Isidore of Seville, and came to the conclusion that Christ had been born 3,952 years after the creation of the world, rather than the figure of over 5,000 years that was commonly accepted by theologians. The accusation occurred in front of the bishop of Hexham, Wilfrid, who was present at a feast when some drunken monks made the accusation. Wilfrid did not respond to the accusation, but a monk present relayed the episode to Bede, who replied within a few days to the monk, writing a letter setting forth his defence and asking that the letter also be read to Wilfrid. Bede had another brush with Wilfrid, for the historian says that he met Wilfrid sometime between 706 and 709 and discussed Æthelthryth, the abbess of Ely. Wilfrid had been present at the exhumation of her body in 695, and Bede questioned the bishop about the exact circumstances of the body and asked for more details of her life, as Wilfrid had been her advisor.

In 733, Bede travelled to York to visit Ecgbert, who was then bishop of York. The See of York was elevated to an archbishopric in 735, and it is likely that Bede and Ecgbert discussed the proposal for the elevation during his visit. Bede hoped to visit Ecgbert again in 734 but was too ill to make the journey. Bede also travelled to the monastery of Lindisfarne and at some point visited the otherwise unknown monastery of a monk named , a visit that is mentioned in a letter to that monk. Because of his widespread correspondence with others throughout the British Isles, and because many of the letters imply that Bede had met his correspondents, it is likely that Bede travelled to some other places, although nothing further about timing or locations can be guessed.

It seems certain that he did not visit Rome, however, as he did not mention it in the autobiographical chapter of his &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot;. Nothhelm, a correspondent of Bede&#x27;s who assisted him by finding documents for him in Rome, is known to have visited Bede, though the date cannot be determined beyond the fact that it was after Nothhelm&#x27;s visit to Rome. Except for a few visits to other monasteries, his life was spent in a round of prayer, observance of the monastic discipline and study of the Sacred Scriptures. He was considered the most learned man of his time.
Bede died at Jarrow on the Feast of the Ascension, 26 May 735 and was buried there. Cuthbert, a disciple of Bede&#x27;s, wrote a letter to a Cuthwin (of whom nothing else is known), describing Bede&#x27;s last days and his death. According to Cuthbert, Bede fell ill, &quot;with frequent attacks of breathlessness but almost without pain&quot;, before Easter. On the Tuesday, two days before Bede died, his breathing became worse and his feet swelled. He continued to dictate to a scribe, however, and despite spending the night awake in prayer he dictated again the following day.

At three o&#x27;clock, according to Cuthbert, he asked for a box of his to be brought and distributed among the priests of the monastery &quot;a few treasures&quot; of his: &quot;some pepper, and napkins, and some incense&quot;. That night he dictated a final sentence to the scribe, a boy named Wilberht, and died soon afterwards. The account of Cuthbert does not make entirely clear whether Bede died before midnight or after. However, by the reckoning of Bede&#x27;s time, passage from the old day to the new occurred at sunset, not midnight, and Cuthbert is clear that he died after sunset. Thus, while his box was brought at three o&#x27;clock Wednesday afternoon of 25 May, by the time of the final dictation it was considered 26 May, although it might still have been 25 May in modern usage.

Cuthbert&#x27;s letter also relates a five-line poem in the vernacular that Bede composed on his deathbed, known as &quot;Bede&#x27;s Death Song&quot;. It is the most-widely copied Old English poem and appears in 45 manuscripts, but its attribution to Bede is not certain—not all manuscripts name Bede as the author, and the ones that do are of later origin than those that do not. Bede&#x27;s remains may have been translated to Durham Cathedral in the 11th century; his tomb there was looted in 1541, but the contents were probably re-interred in the Galilee chapel at the cathedral.

One further oddity in his writings is that in one of his works, the &quot;Commentary on the Seven Catholic Epistles&quot;, he writes in a manner that gives the impression he was married. The section in question is the only one in that work that is written in first-person view. Bede says: &quot;Prayers are hindered by the conjugal duty because as often as I perform what is due to my wife I am not able to pray.&quot; Another passage, in the &quot;Commentary on Luke&quot;, also mentions a wife in the first person: &quot;Formerly I possessed a wife in the lustful passion of desire and now I possess her in honourable sanctification and true love of Christ.&quot; The historian Benedicta Ward argued that these passages are Bede employing a rhetorical device.

== Works ==
Bede wrote scientific, historical and theological works, reflecting the range of his writings from music and metrics to exegetical Scripture commentaries. He knew patristic literature, as well as Pliny the Elder, Virgil, Lucretius, Ovid, Horace and other classical writers. He knew some Greek. Bede&#x27;s scriptural commentaries employed the allegorical method of interpretation, and his history includes accounts of miracles, which to modern historians has seemed at odds with his critical approach to the materials in his history. Modern studies have shown the important role such concepts played in the world-view of early medieval scholars. Although Bede is mainly studied as a historian now, in his time his works on grammar, chronology, and biblical studies were as important as his historical and hagiographical works. The non-historical works contributed greatly to the Carolingian Renaissance. He has been credited with writing a penitential, though his authorship of this work is disputed.

=== &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot; ===
Bede&#x27;s best-known work is the , or &quot;An Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;, completed in about 731. Bede was aided in writing this book by Albinus, abbot of St Augustine&#x27;s Abbey, Canterbury. The first of the five books begins with some geographical background and then sketches the history of England, beginning with Caesar&#x27;s invasion in 55 BC. A brief account of Christianity in Roman Britain, including the martyrdom of St Alban, is followed by the story of Augustine&#x27;s mission to England in 597, which brought Christianity to the Anglo-Saxons.

The second book begins with the death of Gregory the Great in 604 and follows the further progress of Christianity in Kent and the first attempts to evangelise Northumbria. These ended in disaster when Penda, the pagan king of Mercia, killed the newly Christian Edwin of Northumbria at the Battle of Hatfield Chase in about 632. The setback was temporary, and the third book recounts the growth of Christianity in Northumbria under kings Oswald of Northumbria and Oswy. The climax of the third book is the account of the Council of Whitby, traditionally seen as a major turning point in English history. The fourth book begins with the consecration of Theodore as Archbishop of Canterbury and recounts Wilfrid&#x27;s efforts to bring Christianity to the Kingdom of Sussex.

The fifth book brings the story up to Bede&#x27;s day and includes an account of missionary work in Frisia and of the conflict with the British church over the correct dating of Easter. Bede wrote a preface for the work, in which he dedicates it to Ceolwulf, king of Northumbria. The preface mentions that Ceolwulf received an earlier draft of the book; presumably Ceolwulf knew enough Latin to understand it, and he may even have been able to read it. The preface makes it clear that Ceolwulf had requested the earlier copy, and Bede had asked for Ceolwulf&#x27;s approval; this correspondence with the king indicates that Bede&#x27;s monastery had connections among the Northumbrian nobility.

==== Sources ====
The monastery at Wearmouth-Jarrow had an excellent library. Both Benedict Biscop and Ceolfrith had acquired books from the Continent, and in Bede&#x27;s day the monastery was a renowned centre of learning. It has been estimated that there were about 200 books in the monastic library.

For the period prior to Augustine&#x27;s arrival in 597, Bede drew on earlier writers, including Solinus. He had access to two works of Eusebius: the &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot;, and also the &quot;Chronicon&quot;, though he had neither in the original Greek; instead he had a Latin translation of the &quot;Historia&quot;, by Rufinus, and Jerome&#x27;s translation of the &quot;Chronicon&quot;. He also knew Orosius&#x27;s &quot;Adversus Paganus&quot;, and Gregory of Tours&#x27; &quot;Historia Francorum&quot;, both Christian histories, as well as the work of Eutropius, a pagan historian. He used Constantius&#x27;s &quot;Life of Germanus&quot; as a source for Germanus&#x27;s visits to Britain.

Bede&#x27;s account of the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain is drawn largely from Gildas&#x27;s &quot;De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae&quot;. Bede would also have been familiar with more recent accounts such as Stephen of Ripon&#x27;s &quot;Life of Wilfrid&quot;, and anonymous &quot;Life&quot; &quot;of Gregory the Great&quot; and &quot;Life of Cuthbert&quot;. He also drew on Josephus&#x27;s &quot;Antiquities&quot;, and the works of Cassiodorus, and there was a copy of the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot; in Bede&#x27;s monastery. Bede quotes from several classical authors, including Cicero, Plautus, and Terence, but he may have had access to their work via a Latin grammar rather than directly. However, it is clear he was familiar with the works of Virgil and with Pliny the Elder&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot;, and his monastery also owned copies of the works of Dionysius Exiguus.

He probably drew his account of Alban from a life of that saint which has not survived. He acknowledges two other lives of saints directly; one is a life of Fursa, and the other of Æthelburh; the latter no longer survives. He also had access to a life of Ceolfrith. Some of Bede&#x27;s material came from oral traditions, including a description of the physical appearance of Paulinus of York, who had died nearly 90 years before Bede&#x27;s &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot; was written.

Bede had correspondents who supplied him with material. Albinus, the abbot of the monastery in Canterbury, provided much information about the church in Kent, and with the assistance of Nothhelm, at that time a priest in London, obtained copies of Gregory the Great&#x27;s correspondence from Rome relating to Augustine&#x27;s mission. Almost all of Bede&#x27;s information regarding Augustine is taken from these letters. Bede acknowledged his correspondents in the preface to the &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot;; he was in contact with Bishop Daniel of Winchester, for information about the history of the church in Wessex and also wrote to the monastery at Lastingham for information about Cedd and Chad. Bede also mentions an Abbot Esi as a source for the affairs of the East Anglian church, and Bishop Cynibert for information about Lindsey.

The historian Walter Goffart argues that Bede based the structure of the &quot;Historia&quot; on three works, using them as the framework around which the three main sections of the work were structured. For the early part of the work, up until the Gregorian mission, Goffart feels that Bede used &quot;De excidio&quot;. The second section, detailing the Gregorian mission of Augustine of Canterbury was framed on &quot;Life of Gregory the Great&quot; written at Whitby. The last section, detailing events after the Gregorian mission, Goffart feels was modelled on &quot;Life of Wilfrid&quot;. Most of Bede&#x27;s informants for information after Augustine&#x27;s mission came from the eastern part of Britain, leaving significant gaps in the knowledge of the western areas, which were those areas likely to have a native Briton presence.

==== Models and style ====
Bede&#x27;s stylistic models included some of the same authors from whom he drew the material for the earlier parts of his history. His introduction imitates the work of Orosius, and his title is an echo of Eusebius&#x27;s &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot;. Bede also followed Eusebius in taking the &quot;Acts of the Apostles&quot; as the model for the overall work: where Eusebius used the &quot;Acts&quot; as the theme for his description of the development of the church, Bede made it the model for his history of the Anglo-Saxon church. Bede quoted his sources at length in his narrative, as Eusebius had done. Bede also appears to have taken quotes directly from his correspondents at times. For example, he almost always uses the terms &quot;Australes&quot; and &quot;Occidentales&quot; for the South and West Saxons respectively, but in a passage in the first book he uses &quot;Meridiani&quot; and &quot;Occidui&quot; instead, as perhaps his informant had done. At the end of the work, Bede adds a brief autobiographical note; this was an idea taken from Gregory of Tours&#x27; earlier &quot;History of the Franks&quot;.

Bede&#x27;s work as a hagiographer and his detailed attention to dating were both useful preparations for the task of writing the &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot;. His interest in computus, the science of calculating the date of Easter, was also useful in the account he gives of the controversy between the British and Anglo-Saxon church over the correct method of obtaining the Easter date.

Bede is described by Michael Lapidge as &quot;without question the most accomplished Latinist produced in these islands in the Anglo-Saxon period&quot;. His Latin has been praised for its clarity, but his style in the &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot; is not simple. He knew rhetoric and often used figures of speech and rhetorical forms which cannot easily be reproduced in translation, depending as they often do on the connotations of the Latin words. However, unlike contemporaries such as Aldhelm, whose Latin is full of difficulties, Bede&#x27;s own text is easy to read. In the words of Charles Plummer, one of the best-known editors of the &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot;, Bede&#x27;s Latin is &quot;clear and limpid ... it is very seldom that we have to pause to think of the meaning of a sentence ... Alcuin rightly praises Bede for his unpretending style.&quot;

==== Intent ====
Bede&#x27;s primary intention in writing the &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot; was to show the growth of the united church throughout England. The native Britons, whose Christian church survived the departure of the Romans, earn Bede&#x27;s ire for refusing to help convert the Anglo-Saxons; by the end of the &quot;Historia&quot; the English, and their church, are dominant over the Britons. This goal, of showing the movement towards unity, explains Bede&#x27;s animosity towards the British method of calculating Easter: much of the &quot;Historia&quot; is devoted to a history of the dispute, including the final resolution at the Synod of Whitby in 664. Bede is also concerned to show the unity of the English, despite the disparate kingdoms that still existed when he was writing. He also wants to instruct the reader by spiritual example and to entertain, and to the latter end he adds stories about many of the places and people about which he wrote.

N. J. Higham argues that Bede designed his work to promote his reform agenda to Ceolwulf, the Northumbrian king. Bede painted a highly optimistic picture of the current situation in the Church, as opposed to the more pessimistic picture found in his private letters.

Bede&#x27;s extensive use of miracles can prove difficult for readers who consider him a more or less reliable historian but do not accept the possibility of miracles. Yet both reflect an inseparable integrity and regard for accuracy and truth, expressed in terms both of historical events and of a tradition of Christian faith that continues. Bede, like Gregory the Great whom Bede quotes on the subject in the &quot;Historia&quot;, felt that faith brought about by miracles was a stepping stone to a higher, truer faith, and that as a result miracles had their place in a work designed to instruct.

==== Omissions and biases ====
Bede is somewhat reticent about the career of Wilfrid, a contemporary and one of the most prominent clerics of his day. This may be because Wilfrid&#x27;s opulent lifestyle was uncongenial to Bede&#x27;s monastic mind; it may also be that the events of Wilfrid&#x27;s life, divisive and controversial as they were, simply did not fit with Bede&#x27;s theme of the progression to a unified and harmonious church.

Bede&#x27;s account of the early migrations of the Angles and Saxons to England omits any mention of a movement of those peoples across the English Channel from Britain to Brittany described by Procopius, who was writing in the sixth century. Frank Stenton describes this omission as &quot;a scholar&#x27;s dislike of the indefinite&quot;; traditional material that could not be dated or used for Bede&#x27;s didactic purposes had no interest for him.

Bede was a Northumbrian, and this tinged his work with a local bias. The sources to which he had access gave him less information about the west of England than for other areas. He says relatively little about the achievements of Mercia and Wessex, omitting, for example, any mention of Boniface, a West Saxon missionary to the continent of some renown and of whom Bede had almost certainly heard, though Bede does discuss Northumbrian missionaries to the continent. He is also parsimonious in his praise for Aldhelm, a West Saxon who had done much to convert the native Britons to the Roman form of Christianity. He lists seven kings of the Anglo-Saxons whom he regards as having held &quot;imperium&quot;, or overlordship; only one king of Wessex, Ceawlin, is listed as Bretwalda, and none from Mercia, though elsewhere he acknowledges the secular power several of the Mercians held. Historian Robin Fleming states that he was so hostile to Mercia because Northumbria had been diminished by Mercian power that he consulted no Mercian informants and included no stories about its saints.

Bede relates the story of Augustine&#x27;s mission from Rome, and tells how the British clergy refused to assist Augustine in the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons. This, combined with Gildas&#x27;s negative assessment of the British church at the time of the Anglo-Saxon invasions, led Bede to a very critical view of the native church. However, Bede ignores the fact that at the time of Augustine&#x27;s mission, the history between the two was one of warfare and conquest, which, in the words of Barbara Yorke, would have naturally &quot;curbed any missionary impulses towards the Anglo-Saxons from the British clergy.&quot;

==== Use of &quot;Anno Domini&quot; ====
At the time Bede wrote the &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot;, there were two common ways of referring to dates. One was to use indictions, which were 15-year cycles, counting from 312 AD. There were three different varieties of indiction, each starting on a different day of the year. The other approach was to use regnal years—the reigning Roman emperor, for example, or the ruler of whichever kingdom was under discussion. This meant that in discussing conflicts between kingdoms, the date would have to be given in the regnal years of all the kings involved. Bede used both these approaches on occasion but adopted a third method as his main approach to dating: the &quot;Anno Domini&quot; method invented by Dionysius Exiguus. Although Bede did not invent this method, his adoption of it and his promulgation of it in &quot;De Temporum Ratione&quot;, his work on chronology, is the main reason it is now so widely used. Bede&#x27;s Easter table, contained in &quot;De Temporum Ratione&quot;, was developed from Dionysius Exiguus&#x27; Easter table.

==== Assessment ====
The &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot; was copied often in the Middle Ages, and about 160 manuscripts containing it survive. About half of those are located on the European continent, rather than in the British Isles. Most of the 8th- and 9th-century texts of Bede&#x27;s &quot;Historia&quot; come from the northern parts of the Carolingian Empire. This total does not include manuscripts with only a part of the work, of which another 100 or so survive. It was printed for the first time between 1474 and 1482, probably at Strasbourg.

Modern historians have studied the &quot;Historia&quot; extensively, and several editions have been produced. For many years, early Anglo-Saxon history was essentially a retelling of the &quot;Historia&quot;, but recent scholarship has focused as much on what Bede did not write as what he did. The belief that the &quot;Historia&quot; was the culmination of Bede&#x27;s works, the aim of all his scholarship, was a belief common among historians in the past but is no longer accepted by most scholars.

Modern historians and editors of Bede have been lavish in their praise of his achievement in the &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot;. Stenton regards it as one of the &quot;small class of books which transcend all but the most fundamental conditions of time and place&quot;, and regards its quality as dependent on Bede&#x27;s &quot;astonishing power of co-ordinating the fragments of information which came to him through tradition, the relation of friends, or documentary evidence ... In an age where little was attempted beyond the registration of fact, he had reached the conception of history.&quot; Patrick Wormald describes him as &quot;the first and greatest of England&#x27;s historians&quot;.

The &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot; has given Bede a high reputation, but his concerns were different from those of a modern writer of history. His focus on the history of the organisation of the English church, and on heresies and the efforts made to root them out, led him to exclude the secular history of kings and kingdoms except where a moral lesson could be drawn or where they illuminated events in the church. Besides the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, the medieval writers William of Malmesbury, Henry of Huntingdon, and Geoffrey of Monmouth used his works as sources and inspirations. Early modern writers, such as Polydore Vergil and Matthew Parker, the Elizabethan Archbishop of Canterbury, also utilised the &quot;Historia&quot;, and his works were used by both Protestant and Catholic sides in the wars of religion.

Some historians have questioned the reliability of some of Bede&#x27;s accounts. One historian, Charlotte Behr, thinks that the &quot;Historia&#x27;s&quot; account of the arrival of the Germanic invaders in Kent should not be considered to relate what actually happened, but rather relates myths that were current in Kent during Bede&#x27;s time.

It is likely that Bede&#x27;s work, because it was so widely copied, discouraged others from writing histories and may even have led to the disappearance of manuscripts containing older historical works.

=== Other historical works ===
==== Chronicles ====
As Chapter 66 of his &quot;On the Reckoning of Time&quot;, in 725 Bede wrote the &quot;Greater Chronicle&quot; (&quot;chronica maiora&quot;), which sometimes circulated as a separate work. For recent events the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, like his &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot;, relied upon Gildas, upon a version of the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot; current at least to the papacy of Pope Sergius I (687–701), and other sources. For earlier events he drew on Eusebius&#x27;s &quot;Chronikoi Kanones.&quot; The dating of events in the &quot;Chronicle&quot; is inconsistent with his other works, using the era of creation, the &quot;Anno Mundi&quot;.

==== Hagiography ====
His other historical works included lives of the abbots of Wearmouth and Jarrow, as well as verse and prose lives of St Cuthbert, an adaptation of Paulinus of Nola&#x27;s &quot;Life of St Felix&quot;, and a translation of the Greek &quot;Passion&quot; of St Anastasius. He also created a listing of saints, the &quot;Martyrology&quot;.

=== Theological works ===
In his own time, Bede was as well known for his biblical commentaries, and for his exegetical and other theological works. The majority of his writings were of this type and covered the Old Testament and the New Testament. Most survived the Middle Ages, but a few were lost. It was for his theological writings that he earned the title of &quot;Doctor Anglorum&quot; and why he was declared a saint.

Bede synthesised and transmitted the learning from his predecessors, as well as made careful, judicious innovation in knowledge (such as recalculating the age of the Earth—for which he was censured before surviving the heresy accusations and eventually having his views championed by Archbishop Ussher in the sixteenth century—see below) that had theological implications. In order to do this, he learned Greek and attempted to learn Hebrew. He spent time reading and rereading both the Old and the New Testaments. He mentions that he studied from a text of Jerome&#x27;s Vulgate, which itself was from the Hebrew text.

He also studied both the Latin and the Greek Fathers of the Church. In the monastic library at Jarrow were numerous books by theologians, including works by Basil, Cassian, John Chrysostom, Isidore of Seville, Origen, Gregory of Nazianzus, Augustine of Hippo, Jerome, Pope Gregory I, Ambrose of Milan, Cassiodorus, and Cyprian. He used these, in conjunction with the Biblical texts themselves, to write his commentaries and other theological works.

He had a Latin translation by Evagrius of Athanasius&#x27;s &quot;Life of Antony&quot; and a copy of Sulpicius Severus&#x27; &quot;Life of St Martin&quot;. He also used lesser known writers, such as Fulgentius, Julian of Eclanum, Tyconius, and Prosper of Aquitaine. Bede was the first to refer to Jerome, Augustine, Pope Gregory and Ambrose as the four Latin Fathers of the Church. It is clear from Bede&#x27;s own comments that he felt his calling was to explain to his students and readers the theology and thoughts of the Church Fathers.

Bede also wrote homilies, works written to explain theology used in worship services. He wrote homilies on the major Christian seasons such as Advent, Lent, or Easter, as well as on other subjects such as anniversaries of significant events.

Both types of Bede&#x27;s theological works circulated widely in the Middle Ages. Several of his biblical commentaries were incorporated into the &quot;Glossa Ordinaria&quot;, an 11th-century collection of biblical commentaries. Some of Bede&#x27;s homilies were collected by Paul the Deacon, and they were used in that form in the Monastic Office. Boniface used Bede&#x27;s homilies in his missionary efforts on the continent.

Bede sometimes included in his theological books an acknowledgement of the predecessors on whose works he drew. In two cases he left instructions that his marginal notes, which gave the details of his sources, should be preserved by the copyist, and he may have originally added marginal comments about his sources to others of his works. Where he does not specify, it is still possible to identify books to which he must have had access by quotations that he uses. A full catalogue of the library available to Bede in the monastery cannot be reconstructed, but it is possible to tell, for example, that Bede was very familiar with the works of Virgil.

There is little evidence that he had access to any other of the pagan Latin writers—he quotes many of these writers, but the quotes are almost always found in the Latin grammars that were common in his day, one or more of which would certainly have been at the monastery. Another difficulty is that manuscripts of early writers were often incomplete: it is apparent that Bede had access to Pliny&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopaedia&quot;, for example, but it seems that the version he had was missing book xviii, since he did not quote from it in his &quot;De temporum ratione&quot;.Bede&#x27;s works included &quot;Commentary on Revelation&quot;, &quot;Commentary on the Catholic Epistles&quot;, &quot;Commentary on Acts&quot;, &quot;Reconsideration on the Books of Acts&quot;, &quot;On the Gospel of Mark&quot;, &quot;On the Gospel of Luke&quot;, and &quot;Homilies on the Gospels&quot;. At the time of his death he was working on a translation of the Gospel of John into English. He did this for the last 40 days of his life. When the last passage had been translated he said: &quot;All is finished.&quot; The works dealing with the Old Testament included &quot;Commentary on Samuel&quot;, &quot;Commentary on Genesis&quot;, &quot;Commentaries on Ezra and Nehemiah&quot;, &quot;On the Temple&quot;, &quot;On the Tabernacle&quot;, &quot;Commentaries on Tobit&quot;, &quot;Commentaries on Proverbs&quot;, &quot;Commentaries on the Song of Songs&quot;, &quot;Commentaries on the Canticle of Habakkuk&quot;. The works on Ezra, the tabernacle and the temple were especially influenced by Gregory the Great&#x27;s writings.

=== Historical and astronomical chronology ===

&quot;De temporibus&quot;, or &quot;On Time&quot;, written in about 703, provides an introduction to the principles of Easter computus. This was based on parts of Isidore of Seville&#x27;s &quot;Etymologies&quot;, and Bede also included a chronology of the world which was derived from Eusebius, with some revisions based on Jerome&#x27;s translation of the Bible. In about 723, Bede wrote a longer work on the same subject, &quot;On the Reckoning of Time&quot;, which was influential throughout the Middle Ages. He also wrote several shorter letters and essays discussing specific aspects of computus.

&quot;On the Reckoning of Time&quot; (&quot;De temporum ratione&quot;) included an introduction to the traditional ancient and medieval view of the cosmos, including an explanation of how the spherical Earth influenced the changing length of daylight, of how the seasonal motion of the Sun and Moon influenced the changing appearance of the new moon at evening twilight. Bede also records the effect of the moon on tides. He shows that the twice-daily timing of tides is related to the Moon and that the lunar monthly cycle of spring and neap tides is also related to the Moon&#x27;s position. He goes on to note that the times of tides vary along the same coast and that the water movements cause low tide at one place when there is high tide elsewhere. Since the focus of his book was the computus, Bede gave instructions for computing the date of Easter from the date of the Paschal full moon, for calculating the motion of the Sun and Moon through the zodiac, and for many other calculations related to the calendar. He gives some information about the months of the Anglo-Saxon calendar.

Any codex of Bede&#x27;s Easter table is normally found together with a codex of his &quot;De temporum ratione&quot;. His Easter table, being an exact extension of Dionysius Exiguus&#x27; Paschal table and covering the time interval AD 532–1063, contains a 532-year Paschal cycle based on the so-called classical Alexandrian 19-year lunar cycle, being the close variant of bishop Theophilus&#x27; 19-year lunar cycle proposed by Annianus and adopted by bishop Cyril of Alexandria around AD 425. The ultimate similar (but rather different) predecessor of this Metonic 19-year lunar cycle is the one invented by Anatolius around AD 260.

For calendric purposes, Bede made a new calculation of the age of the world since the creation, which he dated as 3952 BC. Because of his innovations in computing the age of the world, he was accused of heresy at the table of Bishop Wilfrid, his chronology being contrary to accepted calculations. Once informed of the accusations of these &quot;lewd rustics&quot;, Bede refuted them in his Letter to Plegwin.

In addition to these works on astronomical timekeeping, he also wrote &quot;De natura rerum&quot;, or &quot;On the Nature of Things&quot;, modelled in part after the work of the same title by Isidore of Seville. His works were so influential that late in the ninth century Notker the Stammerer, a monk of the Monastery of St Gall in Switzerland, wrote that &quot;God, the orderer of natures, who raised the Sun from the East on the fourth day of Creation, in the sixth day of the world has made Bede rise from the West as a new Sun to illuminate the whole Earth&quot;.

=== Educational works ===
Bede wrote some works designed to help teach grammar in the abbey school. One of these was &quot;De arte metrica&quot;, a discussion of the composition of Latin verse, drawing on previous grammarians&#x27; work. It was based on Donatus&#x27;s &quot;De pedibus&quot; and Servius&#x27;s &quot;De finalibus&quot; and used examples from Christian poets as well as Virgil. It became a standard text for the teaching of Latin verse during the next few centuries. Bede dedicated this work to Cuthbert, apparently a student, for he is named &quot;beloved son&quot; in the dedication, and Bede says &quot;I have laboured to educate you in divine letters and ecclesiastical statutes.&quot; &quot;De orthographia&quot; is a work on orthography, designed to help a medieval reader of Latin with unfamiliar abbreviations and words from classical Latin works. Although it could serve as a textbook, it appears to have been mainly intended as a reference work. The date of composition for both of these works is unknown.

&quot;De schematibus et tropis sacrae scripturae&quot; discusses the Bible&#x27;s use of rhetoric. Bede was familiar with pagan authors such as Virgil, but it was not considered appropriate to teach biblical grammar from such texts, and Bede argues for the superiority of Christian texts in understanding Christian literature. Similarly, his text on poetic metre uses only Christian poetry for examples.

===Latin poetry===
A number of poems have been attributed to Bede. His poetic output has been systematically surveyed and edited by Michael Lapidge, who concluded that the following works belong to Bede: the &quot;Versus de die iudicii&quot; (&quot;verses on the day of Judgement&quot;, found complete in 33 manuscripts and fragmentarily in 10); the metrical &quot;Vita Sancti Cudbercti&quot; (&quot;Life of St Cuthbert&quot;); and two collections of verse mentioned in the &quot;Historia ecclesiastica&quot; V.24.2. Bede names the first of these collections as &quot;librum epigrammatum heroico metro siue elegiaco&quot; (&quot;a book of epigrams in the heroic or elegiac metre&quot;), and much of its content has been reconstructed by Lapidge from scattered attestations under the title &quot;Liber epigrammatum&quot;. The second is named as &quot;liber hymnorum diuerso metro siue rythmo&quot; (&quot;a book of hymns, diverse in metre or rhythm&quot;); this has been reconstructed by Lapidge as containing ten liturgical hymns, one paraliturgical hymn (for the Feast of St Æthelthryth), and four other hymn-like compositions.

=== Vernacular poetry ===
According to his disciple Cuthbert, Bede was &quot;doctus in nostris carminibus&quot; (&quot;learned in our songs&quot;). Cuthbert&#x27;s letter on Bede&#x27;s death, the &quot;Epistola Cuthberti de obitu Bedae&quot;, moreover, commonly is understood to indicate that Bede composed a five-line vernacular poem known to modern scholars as &quot;Bede&#x27;s Death Song&quot;
As Opland notes, however, it is not entirely clear that Cuthbert is attributing this text to Bede: most manuscripts of the latter do not use a finite verb to describe Bede&#x27;s presentation of the song, and the theme was relatively common in Old English and Anglo-Latin literature. The fact that Cuthbert&#x27;s description places the performance of the Old English poem in the context of a series of quoted passages from Sacred Scripture might be taken as evidence simply that Bede also cited analogous vernacular texts.

On the other hand, the inclusion of the Old English text of the poem in Cuthbert&#x27;s Latin letter, the observation that Bede &quot;was learned in our song,&quot; and the fact that Bede composed a Latin poem on the same subject all point to the possibility of his having written it. By citing the poem directly, Cuthbert seems to imply that its particular wording was somehow important, either since it was a vernacular poem endorsed by a scholar who evidently frowned upon secular entertainment or because it is a direct quotation of Bede&#x27;s last original composition.

== Veneration ==
There is no evidence for cult being paid to Bede in England in the 8th century. One reason for this may be that he died on the feast day of Augustine of Canterbury. Later, when he was venerated in England, he was either commemorated after Augustine on 26 May, or his feast was moved to 27 May. However, he was venerated outside England, mainly through the efforts of Boniface and Alcuin, both of whom promoted the cult on the continent. Boniface wrote repeatedly back to England during his missionary efforts, requesting copies of Bede&#x27;s theological works.

Alcuin, who was taught at the school set up in York by Bede&#x27;s pupil Ecgbert, praised Bede as an example for monks to follow and was instrumental in disseminating Bede&#x27;s works to all of Alcuin&#x27;s friends. Bede&#x27;s cult became prominent in England during the 10th-century revival of monasticism and by the 14th century had spread to many of the cathedrals of England. Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester was a particular devotee of Bede&#x27;s, dedicating a church to him in 1062, which was Wulfstan&#x27;s first undertaking after his consecration as bishop.

His body was &#x27;translated&#x27; (the ecclesiastical term for relocation of relics) from Jarrow to Durham Cathedral around 1020, where it was placed in the same tomb with St Cuthbert. Later Bede&#x27;s remains were moved to a shrine in the Galilee Chapel at Durham Cathedral in 1370. The shrine was destroyed during the English Reformation, but the bones were reburied in the chapel. In 1831 the bones were dug up and then reburied in a new tomb, which is still there. Other relics were claimed by York, Glastonbury and Fulda.

His scholarship and importance to Catholicism were recognised in 1899 when the Vatican declared him a Doctor of the Church. He is the only Englishman named a Doctor of the Church. He is also the only Englishman in Dante&#x27;s &quot;Paradise&quot; (&quot;Paradiso&quot; X.130), mentioned among theologians and doctors of the church in the same canto as Isidore of Seville and the Scot Richard of St Victor.

His feast day was included in the General Roman Calendar in 1899, for celebration on 27 May rather than on his date of death, 26 May, which was then the feast day of St Augustine of Canterbury. He is venerated in the Catholic Church, in the Church of England and in the Episcopal Church (United States) on 25 May, and in the Eastern Orthodox Church, with a feast day on 27 May (Βεδέα του Ομολογητού).

Bede became known as &quot;Venerable Bede&quot; (Latin: ) by the 9th century because of his holiness, but this was not linked to consideration for sainthood by the Catholic Church. According to a legend, the epithet was miraculously supplied by angels, thus completing his unfinished epitaph. It is first utilised in connection with Bede in the 9th century, where Bede was grouped with others who were called &quot;venerable&quot; at two ecclesiastical councils held at Aachen in 816 and 836. Paul the Deacon then referred to him as venerable consistently. By the 11th and 12th century, it had become commonplace.

===Modern legacy===
Bede&#x27;s reputation as a historian, based mostly on the &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot;, remains strong. Thomas Carlyle called him &quot;the greatest historical writer since Herodotus&quot;. Walter Goffart says of Bede that he &quot;holds a privileged and unrivalled place among first historians of Christian Europe&quot;. He is patron of Beda College in Rome which prepares older men for the Roman Catholic priesthood. His life and work have been celebrated with the annual Jarrow Lecture, held at St Paul&#x27;s Church, Jarrow, since 1958. 
Bede has been described as a progressive scholar, who made Latin and Greek teachings accessible to his fellow Anglo-Saxons.

Jarrow Hall (formerly Bede&#x27;s World), in Jarrow, is a museum that documents the history of Bede and other parts of English heritage, on the site where he lived.

Bede Metro station, part of the Tyne and Wear Metro light rail network, is named after him.

<text>Bubble tea (also known as pearl milk tea, bubble milk tea, tapioca milk tea, boba tea, or boba; , ) is a tea-based drink that originated in Taiwan in the early 1980s. Taiwanese immigrants brought it to the United States in the 1990s, initially in California through regions including Los Angeles County, but the drink has also spread to other countries where there is a large East Asian diaspora population.

Bubble tea most commonly consists of tea accompanied by chewy tapioca pearls (also known as &quot;boba&quot; or &quot;balls&quot;), but it can be made with other toppings as well, such as grass jelly, aloe vera, red bean, and popping boba. It has many varieties and flavours, but the two most popular varieties are pearl black milk tea and pearl green milk tea (&quot;pearl&quot; for the tapioca balls at the bottom).

==Description==

Bubble teas fall under two categories: teas without milk and milk teas. Both varieties come with a choice of black, green, or oolong tea as the base. Milk teas usually include powdered or fresh milk, but may also use condensed milk, almond milk, soy milk, or coconut milk.

The oldest known bubble tea drink consisted of a mixture of hot Taiwanese black tea, tapioca pearls (), condensed milk, and syrup () or honey. Bubble tea is most commonly served cold. The tapioca pearls that give bubble tea its name were originally made from the starch of the cassava, a tropical shrub known for its starchy roots which was introduced to Taiwan from South America during Japanese colonial rule. Larger pearls () quickly replaced these.

Some cafés specialize in bubble tea production. While some cafés may serve bubble tea in a glass, most Taiwanese bubble tea shops serve the drink in a plastic cup and use a machine to seal the top of the cup with heated plastic cellophane. The method allows the tea to be shaken in the serving cup and makes it spill-free until a person is ready to drink it. The cellophane is then pierced with an oversized straw, referred to as a boba straw, which is larger than a typical drinking straw to allow the toppings to pass through.

Due to its popularity, bubble tea has inspired a variety of bubble tea flavoured snacks, such as bubble tea ice cream and bubble tea candy. The market size of bubble tea was valued at in 2022 and is projected to reach by the end of 2027. Some of the largest global bubble tea chains include Chatime, CoCo Fresh Tea &amp; Juice and Gong Cha.

===Variants===

==== Drink ====
Bubble tea comes in many variations which usually consist of black tea, green tea, oolong tea, and sometimes white tea. Another variation, yuenyeung, (, named after the Mandarin duck) originated in Hong Kong and consists of black tea, coffee, and milk.

Other varieties of the drink include blended tea drinks. These variations are often either blended using ice cream, or are smoothies that contain both tea and fruit. Boba ice cream bars have also been produced.

There are many popular flavours of bubble tea, such as taro, mango, coffee, and coconut. Flavouring ingredients such as a syrup or powder determines the flavour and usually the colour of the bubble tea, while other ingredients such as tea, milk, and boba are the basis.

==== Toppings ====
Tapioca pearls (boba) are the most common ingredient, although there are other ways to make the chewy spheres found in bubble tea. The pearls vary in color according to the ingredients mixed in with the tapioca. Most pearls a black from brown sugar.

Jelly comes in different shapes: small cubes, stars, or rectangular strips, and flavours such as coconut jelly, konjac, lychee, grass jelly, mango, coffee, and green tea. Azuki bean or mung bean paste, typical toppings for Taiwanese shaved ice desserts, give bubble tea an added subtle flavour as well as texture. Aloe, egg pudding (custard), and sago also can be found in many bubble tea shops. Popping boba, or spheres that have fruit juices or syrups inside them, are another popular bubble tea topping. Flavours include mango, strawberry, coconut, kiwi, and honey melon.

Some shops offer milk or cheese foam on top of the drink, giving the drink a consistency similar to that of whipped cream, and a saltier flavour profile. One shop described the effect of the cheese foam as &quot;neutraliz[ing] the bitterness of the tea...and as you drink it you taste the returning sweetness of the tea.&quot;

==== Ice and sugar level ====

Bubble tea shops often give customers the option of choosing the amount of ice or sugar in their drink. Ice levels are usually specified ordinally (e.g., no ice, less ice, normal ice, more ice), and sugar levels in quarterly intervals (e.g., 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%).

==== Packaging ====
In Southeast Asia, bubble tea is usually packaged in a plastic takeaway cup, sealed with plastic or a rounded cap. New entrants into the market have attempted to distinguish their products by packaging it in bottles and other shapes. Some have used sealed plastic bags. Nevertheless, the plastic takeaway cup with a sealed cap is still the most common packaging method.

==== Preparation method ====
The tea can be made in batches during the day or the night before. Brewing different types of teas take different amounts of time and temperature. For instance, green tea requires brewing at a lower temperature, typically between with a brewing time of 8–10 minutes to extract its optimal flavour. In contrast, black tea needs to be made with hotter water, usually around with a brewing of around 15–20 minutes to bring out its sweetness. A tea warmer dispenser allows the tea to remain heated for up to eight hours. 

Pearls (boba) are made from tapioca starch. Most bubble tea stores buy packaged tapioca pearls in an uncooked stage. When the boba is uncooked and in the package, it is uncolored and hard. The boba does not turn chewy and dark until they are cooked and sugar is added to bring out its taste. Uncooked tapioca pearls in their package can be stored for around 9 to 12 months. Once cooked, they can be stored in a sealed container in the refrigerator. Despite this, most bubble tea stores will not sell their boba after 24 hours because it will start to harden and lose its chewiness.

The traditional preparation method is to mix the ingredients (sugar, powders, and other flavourings) together using a bubble tea shaker cup, by hand. However, many present-day bubble tea shops use a bubble tea shaker machine. This eliminates the need for humans to shake the bubble tea by hand. It also reduces staffing needs as multiple cups of bubble tea may be prepared by a single barista.

==History==
Milk and sugar have been added to tea in Taiwan since the Dutch colonization of Taiwan from 1624–1662.

Before the invention of bubble tea, a similar tea beverage was created in Taiwan called bubble foam tea (). This drink was made by mixing tea with fructose syrup and then shaking it with ice cubes in a shaker. The vigorous shaking created a fine foam, giving the drink its signature texture. Unlike modern pearl milk tea, bubble foam tea did not initially contain tapioca balls.

There are two competing stories for the discovery of bubble tea. One is associated with the Chun Shui Tang tea room in Taichung. Its founder, Liu Han-Chieh, began serving Chinese tea cold after he observed coffee was served cold in Japan while on a visit in the 1980s. The new style of serving tea propelled his business and multiple chains serving this tea were established. The company&#x27;s product development manager, Lin Hsiu Hui, said she created the first bubble tea in 1988 when she poured tapioca balls into her tea during a staff meeting and encouraged others to drink it. The beverage was well received at the meeting, leading to its inclusion on the menu. It ultimately became the franchise&#x27;s top-selling product.

Another claim for the invention of bubble tea comes from the Hanlin Tea Room () in Tainan. It claims that bubble tea was invented in 1986 when teahouse owner Tu Tsong-he was inspired by white tapioca balls he saw in the local market of Yā-mǔ-liáo (). He later made tea using these traditional Taiwanese snacks. This resulted in what is known as &quot;pearl tea.&quot;

== Popularity ==
In the 1990s, bubble tea spread across East and Southeast Asia with its ever-growing popularity. In regions like Hong Kong, mainland China, Japan, Vietnam, and Singapore, the bubble tea trend expanded rapidly among young people. In some popular shops, people would line up for more than thirty minutes to get a drink. In recent years, the popularity of bubble tea has gone beyond the beverage itself, with boba lovers inventing various bubble tea flavoured-foods, including ice cream, pizza, toast, sushi, and ramen.

===Taiwan===
In Taiwan, bubble tea has become not just a beverage, but an enduring icon of the culture and food history for the nation. In 2020, the date April 30 was officially declared as National Bubble Tea Day in Taiwan. That same year, the image of bubble tea was proposed as an alternative cover design for Taiwan&#x27;s passport. According to Al Jazeera, bubble tea has become synonymous with Taiwan and is an important symbol of Taiwanese identity both domestically and internationally. Bubble tea is used to represent Taiwan in the context of the Milk Tea Alliance. 50 Lan is a bubble tea chain founded in Tainan.

=== Hong Kong ===
Hong Kong is famous for its traditional Hong Kong–style milk tea, which is made with brewed black tea and evaporated milk. While milk tea has long become integrated into people&#x27;s daily life, the expansion of Taiwanese bubble tea chains, including Tiger Sugar, Youiccha, and Xing Fu Tang, into Hong Kong created a new wave for &quot;boba tea.&quot;

=== Mainland China ===
Since the idea of adding tapioca pearls into milk tea was introduced into China in the 1990s, bubble tea has increased in popularity. In 2020 it was estimated that the consumption of bubble tea was 5 times that of coffee in recent years. According to data from QianZhen Industry Research Institute, the value of the tea-related beverage market in China reached (about ) in 2018. In 2019, annual sales from bubble tea shops reached as high as (roughly ). While bubble tea chains from Taiwan (e.g., Gong Cha and Coco) are still popular, more local brands, like Yi Dian Dian, Nayuki, Hey Tea, etc., are now dominating the market.

In China, young people&#x27;s growing obsession with bubble tea shaped their way of social interaction. Buying someone a cup of bubble tea has become a new way of informally thanking someone. It is also a favoured topic among friends and on social media.

=== Japan ===
Bubble tea first entered Japan by the late 1990s, but it failed to leave a lasting impression on the public markets. It was not until the 2010s when the bubble tea trend finally swept Japan. Shops from Taiwan, Korea, and China, as well as local brands, began to pop up in cities, and bubble tea has remained one of the hottest trends since then. Bubble tea has become so commonplace among teenagers that teenage girls in Japan invented slang for it: &quot;tapiru&quot; (タピる). The word is short for drinking tapioca tea in Japanese, and it won first place in a survey of &quot;Japanese slang for middle school girls&quot; in 2018. A bubble tea theme park was open for a limited time in 2019 in Harajuku, Tokyo.

=== Singapore ===
Known locally in Chinese as (), bubble tea is loved by many in Singapore. The drink was sold in Singapore as early as 1992 and became phenomenally popular among young people in 2001. This soon ended because of the intense competition and price wars among shops. As a result, most bubble tea shops closed and bubble tea lost its popularity by 2003. When Taiwanese chains like Koi and Gong Cha came to Singapore in 2007 and 2009, the beverage experienced only short resurgences in popularity. In 2018, the interest in bubble tea rose again at an unprecedented speed in Singapore, as new brands like The Alley and Tiger Sugar entered the market; social media also played an important role in driving this renaissance of bubble tea.

===United States===
In the 1990s, Taiwanese immigrants began to introduce bubble tea in Taiwanese restaurants in California. Some of the first stand-alone bubble tea shops can be traced to a food court in Arcadia, in Southern California, and Fantasia Coffee &amp; Tea in Cupertino, in Northern California. Chains like Tapioca Express, Quickly, Lollicup, and Happy Lemon emerged in the late 1990s and early 2000s, bringing the Taiwanese bubble tea trend to the US. Within the Asian American community, bubble tea is commonly known under its colloquial term &quot;boba.&quot;

As the beverage gained popularity in the US, it gradually became more than a drink, but a cultural identity for Asian Americans. This phenomenon was referred to as “boba life” by Chinese-American brothers Andrew and David Fung in their music video, “Bobalife,” released in 2013. Boba symbolizes a subculture that Asian Americans as social minorities could define themselves as, and “boba life” is a reflection of their desire for both cultural and political recognition. It is also used disparagingly in the term boba liberal, a term that derides mainstream Asian-American liberalism. Other regions with large concentrations of bubble tea restaurants in the United States are the Northeast and Southwest. This is reflected in the coffeehouse-style teahouse chains that originate from the regions, such as Boba Tea Company from Albuquerque, New Mexico, No. 1 Boba Tea in Las Vegas, Nevada, and Kung Fu Tea from New York City. Albuquerque and Las Vegas have a large concentrations of boba tea restaurants, as the drink is popular especially among the Hispano, Navajo, Pueblo, and other Native American, Hispanic and Latino American communities in the Southwest.

A massive shipping and supply chain crisis on the U.S. West coast, coupled with the obstruction of the Suez Canal in March 2021, caused a shortage of tapioca pearls for bubble tea shops in the U.S. and Canada. Most of the tapioca consumed in the U.S. is imported from Asia, since the critical ingredient, tapioca starch, is mostly grown in Asia.

TikTok trends and the Korean Wave also fueled the popularity of bubble tea in the United States.

===Vietnam===
Taiwanese milk tea was introduced to Vietnam in the early 2000s, but it took a few years for this drink to become popular with young people. Roadside stalls and carts rarely served milk tea, and the milk tea trend gradually cooled down in the late 2000s. Many shops had to liquidate or close, while others struggled to survive. Bubble tea also gained controversy because of information about tea of unknown origin, tapioca pearls allegedly being made from polymer plastics, etc.

By 2012, Taiwanese brands arrived in Vietnam, still the same old milk tea but served in a completely new style: milk tea with toppings, developing a chain model, and a space designed as well as any famous coffee shop. Also, the halo of Taiwanese milk tea gradually returned, especially around the end of 2016, to the beginning of 2017. According to a survey by Lozi, in 2017, the Vietnamese milk tea market witnessed an explosion with 100 large and small brands coexisting and over 1,500 points of sale, including major brands from Taiwan such as Ding Tea, Gong Cha, BoBaPop. This survey also shows that milk tea is becoming a popular drink in Vietnam when 53% of people are confirmed to drink milk tea at least once a week.

From the consumer perspective, milk tea is characterized by its sweet, creamy taste, suitable for many customers, not only students, but also children and office workers. In addition, milk tea is constantly &quot;transforming&quot; to meet all customer needs, from cheese cream tea, fruit tea to low-fat tea. Another important point that makes milk tea popular is the service style. Instead of small shops and school gate carts like in the past, the milk tea is designed into a spacious space, with fixed seats, and cool air conditioning.

===Korea===
Milk tea is not only a daily drink, but it has also become a &quot;fever drink&quot; loved in many countries, including South Korea. In the capital Seoul alone, there are 4 famous milk tea shops, which are popular places for entertainment, dating, and meeting of Korean youth every weekend, which are Gong Cha, Cofioca, Amasvin, and Happy Lemon.

In Korea, there are many different large and small milk tea shops, famous brands or just small shops with a drink counter and a table. Although pearl milk tea originated in Taiwan, it took certain changes in Korea. Koreans are very concerned about keeping in shape, every meal they have to check exactly how many calories they take in, so that they can do appropriate exercises to burn off excess fat. Therefore, when entering restaurants or bakeries in Korea, we will see the calorie index recorded very carefully as a way to protect the health of consumers. For example, at Gong Cha milk tea shops there, customers can choose the sweetness of their milk tea by choosing the sugar level (0%, 30%, 50%, 70%, and 100%) and similarly choose ice to add personal favourite flavour to their milk tea.

===Australia===
Individual bubble tea shops began to appear in Australia in the 1990s, along with other regional drinks like Eis Cendol. Chains of stores were established as early as 2002, when the Bubble Cup franchise opened its first store in Melbourne. Although originally associated with the rapid growth of immigration from Asia and the vast tertiary student cohort from Asia, in Melbourne and Sydney bubble tea has become popular across many communities.

=== Mauritius ===
The first bubble tea shop in Mauritius opened in late 2012, and since then there have been bubble tea shops in most shopping malls on the island. Bubble tea shops have become a popular place for teenagers to hang out.

==Cultural influence==
In 2020, the Unicode Consortium released the bubble tea emoji () as part of its version 13.0 update.

On 29 January 2023, Google celebrated Bubble Tea with a doodle.

In 2024, Canadian bubble tea company ‘Bobba’ went on CBC&#x27;s Dragon&#x27;s Den to pitch their drinks to potential investors. The company co-owners Sebastien Fiset and Jessica Frenette faced criticism from guest judge Simu Liu regarding their authenticity on the drinks’ cultural origins, to which they defended their intentions by stating their Taiwanese-based suppliers and their desire to modernize the traditional bubble tea drink. This moment in the show’s episode went viral across social platforms and media outlets, sparking debate on whether the westernization of bubble tea had consequently led to it being culturally appropriated. Harmful Asian stereotypes were also recognized from their sales pitch, such as, quote: &quot;never [being] quite sure about its contents,&quot; which references the &#x27;Chinese restaurant syndrome&#x27; rhetoric.

==Potential health concerns==
In July 2019, Singapore&#x27;s Mount Alvernia Hospital warned against the high sugar content of bubble tea since the drink had become extremely popular in Singapore. While it acknowledged the benefits of drinking green tea and black tea in reducing risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, arthritis, and cancer, respectively, the hospital cautions that the addition of other ingredients like non-dairy creamer and toppings in the tea could raise the fat and sugar content of the tea and increase the risk of chronic diseases. Non-dairy creamer is a milk substitute that contains trans fat in the form of hydrogenated palm oil. The hospital warned that this oil has been strongly correlated with an increased risk of heart disease and stroke.

The other concern about bubble tea is its high calorie content, partially attributed to the high-carbohydrate tapioca pearls (), which can make up to half the calorie-count in a serving of bubble tea.

<text>The Battle of Blenheim (; ; ) fought on , was a major battle of the War of the Spanish Succession. The overwhelming Allied victory ensured the safety of Vienna from the Franco-Bavarian army, thus preventing the collapse of the reconstituted Grand Alliance.

Louis XIV of France sought to knock the Holy Roman Emperor, Leopold, out of the war by seizing Vienna, the Habsburg capital, and gain a favourable peace settlement. The dangers to Vienna were considerable: Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria, and Marshal Ferdinand de Marsin&#x27;s forces in Bavaria threatened from the west, and Marshal Louis Joseph de Bourbon, duc de Vendôme&#x27;s large army in northern Italy posed a serious danger with a potential offensive through the Brenner Pass. Vienna was also under pressure from Rákóczi&#x27;s Hungarian revolt from its eastern approaches. Realising the danger, the Duke of Marlborough resolved to alleviate the peril to Vienna by marching his forces south from Bedburg to help maintain Emperor Leopold within the Grand Alliance.

A combination of deception and skilled administration – designed to conceal his true destination from friend and foe alike – enabled Marlborough to march unhindered from the Low Countries to the River Danube in five weeks. After securing Donauwörth on the Danube, Marlborough sought to engage Maximilian&#x27;s and Marsin&#x27;s army before Marshal Camille d&#x27;Hostun, duc de Tallard, could bring reinforcements through the Black Forest. The Franco-Bavarian commanders proved reluctant to fight until their numbers were deemed sufficient, and Marlborough failed in his attempts to force an engagement. When Tallard arrived to bolster Maximilian&#x27;s army, and Prince Eugene of Savoy arrived with reinforcements for the Allies, the two armies finally met on the banks of the Danube in and around the small village of Blindheim, from which the English &quot;Blenheim&quot; is derived.

Blenheim was one of the battles that altered the course of the war, which until then was favouring the French and Spanish Bourbons. Although the battle did not win the war, it prevented a potentially devastating loss for the Grand Alliance and shifted the war&#x27;s momentum, ending French plans of knocking Emperor Leopold out of the war. The French suffered catastrophic casualties in the battle, including their commander-in-chief, Tallard, who was taken captive to England. Before the 1704 campaign ended, the Allies had taken Landau, and the towns of Trier and Trarbach on the Moselle in preparation for the following year&#x27;s campaign into France itself. This offensive never materialised, for the Grand Alliance&#x27;s army had to depart the Moselle to defend Liège from a French counter-offensive. The war continued for another decade before ending in 1714.

==Background==
By 1704, the War of the Spanish Succession was in its fourth year. The previous year had been one of successes for France and her allies, most particularly on the Danube, where Marshal Claude-Louis-Hector de Villars and Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria, had created a direct threat to Vienna, the Habsburg capital. Vienna had been saved by dissension between the two commanders, leading to Villars being replaced by the less dynamic Marshal Ferdinand de Marsin. Nevertheless, the threat was still real: Rákóczi&#x27;s Hungarian revolt was threatening the Empire&#x27;s eastern approaches, and Marshal Louis Joseph, Duke of Vendôme&#x27;s forces threatened an invasion from northern Italy. In the courts of Versailles and Madrid, Vienna&#x27;s fall was confidently anticipated, an event which would almost certainly have led to the collapse of the reconstituted Grand Alliance.

To isolate the Danube from any Allied intervention, Marshal François de Neufville, duc de Villeroi&#x27;s 46,000 troops were expected to pin the 70,000 Dutch and British troops around Maastricht in the Low Countries, while General Robert Jean Antoine de Franquetot de Coigny protected Alsace against surprise with a further corps. The only forces immediately available for Vienna&#x27;s defence were the imperial army under Margrave Louis William of Baden of 36,000 men stationed in the Lines of Stollhofen to watch Marshal Camille d&#x27;Hostun, duc de Tallard, at Strasbourg; and 10,000 men under Prince Eugene of Savoy south of Ulm.

Various Allied statesmen, including the Imperial Austrian Ambassador in London, Count Wratislaw, and the Duke of Marlborough realised the implications of the situation on the Danube. To maintain secrecy, Marlborough kept his plans hidden from both the Dutch States General and the Parliament of England. In the Dutch Republic, only a select few – Grand Pensionary Anthonie Heinsius, Simon van Slingelandt, Jacob Hop, and François Fagel – were privy to his strategy from the outset. In England, Marlborough confided only in Sidney Godolphin, Queen Anne, and her husband. Marlborough, realising the only way to reinforce the Austrians was by the use of secrecy and guile, pretended to move his troops to the Moselle – a plan approved of by the Dutch States General – but once there, he would move further and link up with Austrian forces in southern Germany.

The Dutch diplomat and field deputy Van Rechteren-Almelo would come to play an important role. He made sure that on their 450-kilometre-long march, the Allies would nowhere be denied passage by local rulers, nor would they need to look for provisions, horsefeed or new boots. He also saw to it that sufficient stopovers were arranged along the way to ensure that the Allies arrived at their destination in good condition. This was of paramount importance, for the success of the operation depended on a quick elimination of the Bavarian elector. However, it was not possible to make the logistical arrangements in advance that would have been indispensable to supply the Allied army south of the Danube. For this, the Allies should have had access to the free imperial cities of Ulm and Augsburg, but the Bavarian elector had taken these two cities. This could have become a problem for Marlborough had the Elector avoided a battle and instead entrenched himself south of the Danube. Had Villeroy then managed to take advantage of the weakening of Allied forces in the Netherlands by recapturing Liège and besieging Maastricht, it would have validated the concerns of some of his Dutch adversaries, who were against any major weakening of the forces in the Spanish Netherlands.

==Prelude==

===Protagonists march to the Danube===

Marlborough&#x27;s march started on 19 May from Bedburg, northwest of Cologne. The army assembled by Marlborough&#x27;s brother, General Charles Churchill, consisted of 66 squadrons of cavalry, 31 battalions of infantry and 38 guns and mortars, totalling 21,000 men, 16,000 of whom were British. This force was augmented en route, and by the time it reached the Danube it numbered 40,00047 battalions and 88 squadrons. While Marlborough led this army south, the Dutch general, Henry Overkirk, Count of Nassau, maintained a defensive position in the Dutch Republic against the possibility of Villeroi mounting an attack. Marlborough had assured the Dutch that if the French were to launch an offensive he would return in good time, but he calculated that as he marched south, the French army would be drawn after him. In this assumption Marlborough proved correct: Villeroi shadowed him with 30,000 men in 60 squadrons and 42 battalions. Marlborough wrote to Godolphin: &quot;I am very sensible that I take a great deal upon me, but should I act otherwise, the Empire would be undone ...&quot;

In the meantime, the appointment of Henry Overkirk as Field Marshal caused significant controversy in the Dutch Republic. After the Earl of Athlone&#x27;s death, the Dutch States General had put Overkirk in charge of the Dutch States Army, which led to much discontent among the other high-ranking Dutch generals. Ernst Wilhelm von Salisch, Daniël van Dopff and Menno van Coehoorn threatened to resign or go into the service of other countries, although all were eventually convinced to stay. The new infantry generals were also disgruntled — the Lord of Slangenburg because he had to serve the less experienced Overkirk; and the Count of Noyelles because he had to serve the orders of the &#x27;insupportable&#x27; Slangenburg. Then there was the major problem of the position of the Prince of Orange. The provinces of Friesland and Groningen demanded that their 17-year-old stadtholder be appointed supreme infantry general. This divided the parties so much that a second Grand Assembly, as had existed in 1651, was considered. However, after pressure from the other provinces, Friesland and Groningen adjusted their demands and a compromise was found. The Prince of Orange would nominally be appointed infantry general, behind Slangenburg and Noyelles, but he would not really be in command until he was 20.

While the Allies were making their preparations, the French were striving to maintain and re-supply Marsin. He had been operating with Maximilian II against Margrave Louis William, and was somewhat isolated from France: his only lines of communication lay through the rocky passes of the Black Forest. On 14 May, Tallard brought 8,000 reinforcements and vast supplies and munitions through the difficult terrain, whilst outmanoeuvring , the Imperial general who sought to block his path. Tallard then returned with his own force to the Rhine, once again side-stepping Thüngen&#x27;s efforts to intercept him.

On 26 May, Marlborough reached Coblenz, where the Moselle meets the Rhine. If he intended an attack along the Moselle his army would now have to turn west; instead it crossed to the right bank of the Rhine, and was reinforced by 5,000 waiting Hanoverians and Prussians. The French realised that there would be no campaign on the Moselle. A second possible objective now occurred to theman Allied incursion into Alsace and an attack on Strasbourg. Marlborough furthered this apprehension by constructing bridges across the Rhine at Philippsburg, a ruse that not only encouraged Villeroi to come to Tallard&#x27;s aid in the defence of Alsace, but one that ensured the French plan to march on Vienna was delayed while they waited to see what Marlborough&#x27;s army would do.

Encouraged by Marlborough&#x27;s promise to return to the Netherlands if a French attack developed there, transferring his troops up the Rhine on barges at a rate of a day, the Dutch States General agreed to release the Danish contingent of seven battalions and 22 squadrons as reinforcements. Marlborough reached Ladenburg, in the plain of the Neckar and the Rhine, and there halted for three days to rest his cavalry and allow the guns and infantry to close up. On 6 June he arrived at Wiesloch, south of Heidelberg. The following day, the Allied army swung away from the Rhine towards the hills of the Swabian Jura and the Danube beyond. At last Marlborough&#x27;s destination was established without doubt.

===Strategy===
On 10 June, Marlborough met for the first time the President of the Imperial War Council, Prince Eugene – accompanied by Count Wratislaw – at the village of Mundelsheim, halfway between the Danube and the Rhine. By 13 June, the Imperial Field Commander, Margrave Louis William of Baden, had joined them in Großheppach. The three generals commanded a force of nearly 110,000 men. At this conference, it was decided that Prince Eugene would return with 28,000 men to the Lines of Stollhofen on the Rhine to watch Villeroi and Tallard and prevent them going to the aid of the Franco-Bavarian army on the Danube. Meanwhile, Marlborough&#x27;s and Margrave Louis William&#x27;s forces would combine, totalling 80,000 men, and march on the Danube to seek out Maximilian II and Marsin before they could be reinforced.

Knowing Marlborough&#x27;s destination, Tallard and Villeroi met at Landau in the Palatinate on 13 June to construct a plan to save Bavaria. The rigidity of the French command system was such that any variations from the original plan had to be sanctioned by Versailles. The Count of Mérode-Westerloo, commander of the Flemish troops in Tallard&#x27;s army, wrote &quot;One thing is certain: we delayed our march from Alsace for far too long and quite inexplicably.&quot; Approval from King Louis arrived on 27 June: Tallard was to reinforce Marsin and Maximilian II on the Danube via the Black Forest, with 40 battalions and 50 squadrons; Villeroi was to pin down the Allies defending the Lines of Stollhofen, or, if the Allies should move all their forces to the Danube, he was to join with Tallard; Coigny with 8,000 men would protect Alsace. On 1 July Tallard&#x27;s army of 35,000 re-crossed the Rhine at Kehl and began its march.

On 22 June, Marlborough&#x27;s forces linked up with the Imperial forces at Launsheim, having covered in five weeks. Thanks to a carefully planned timetable, the effects of wear and tear had been kept to a minimum. Captain Parker described the march discipline: &quot;As we marched through the country of our Allies, commissars were appointed to furnish us with all manner of necessaries for man and horse ... the soldiers had nothing to do but pitch their tents, boil kettles and lie down to rest.&quot; In response to Marlborough&#x27;s manoeuvres, Maximilian and Marsin, conscious of their numerical disadvantage with only 40,000 men, moved their forces to the entrenched camp at Dillingen on the north bank of the Danube. Marlborough could not attack Dillingen because of a lack of siege guns – he had been unable to bring any from the Low Countries, and Margrave Louis William had failed to supply any, despite prior assurances that he would.

The Allies needed a base for provisions and a good river crossing. Consequently, on 2 July Marlborough stormed the fortress of Schellenberg on the heights above the town of Donauwörth. Count Jean d&#x27;Arco had been sent with 12,000 men from the Franco-Bavarian camp to hold the town and grassy hill, but after a fierce battle, with heavy casualties on both sides, Schellenberg fell. This forced Donauwörth to surrender shortly afterward. Maximilian, knowing his position at Dillingen was now not tenable, took up a position behind the strong fortifications of Augsburg.

Tallard&#x27;s march presented a dilemma for Prince Eugene. If the Allies were not to be outnumbered on the Danube, he realised that he had to either try to cut Tallard off before he could get there, or to reinforce Marlborough. If he withdrew from the Rhine to the Danube, Villeroi might also make a move south to link up with Maximilian and Marsin. Prince Eugene compromisedleaving 12,000 troops behind guarding the Lines of Stollhofenhe marched off with the rest of his army to forestall Tallard.

Lacking in numbers, Prince Eugene could not seriously disrupt Tallard&#x27;s march but the French marshal&#x27;s progress was proving slow. Tallard&#x27;s force had suffered considerably more than Marlborough&#x27;s troops on their march – many of his cavalry horses were suffering from glanders and the mountain passes were proving tough for the 2,000 wagonloads of provisions. Local German peasants, angry at French plundering, compounded Tallard&#x27;s problems, leading Mérode-Westerloo to bemoan – &quot;the enraged peasantry killed several thousand of our men before the army was clear of the Black Forest.&quot;

At Augsburg, Maximilian was informed on 14 July that Tallard was on his way through the Black Forest. This good news bolstered his policy of inaction, further encouraging him to wait for the reinforcements. This reticence to fight induced Marlborough to undertake a controversial policy of spoliation in Bavaria, burning buildings and crops throughout the rich lands south of the Danube. This had two aims: firstly to put pressure on Maximilian to fight or come to terms before Tallard arrived with reinforcements; and secondly, to ruin Bavaria as a base from which the French and Bavarian armies could attack Vienna, or pursue Marlborough into Franconia if, at some stage, he had to withdraw northwards. But this destruction, coupled with a protracted siege of the town of Rain over 9 to 16 July, caused Prince Eugene to lament &quot;... since the Donauwörth action I cannot admire their performances&quot;, and later to conclude &quot;If he has to go home without having achieved his objective, he will certainly be ruined.&quot;

===Final positioning===
Tallard, with 34,000 men, reached Ulm, joining with Maximilian and Marsin at Augsburg on 5 August, although Maximilian had dispersed his army in response to Marlborough&#x27;s campaign of ravaging the region. Also on 5 August, Prince Eugene reached Höchstädt, riding that same night to meet with Marlborough at Schrobenhausen. Marlborough knew that another crossing point over the Danube was required in case Donauwörth fell to the enemy; so on 7 August, the first of Margrave Louis William&#x27;s 15,000 Imperial troops left Marlborough&#x27;s main force to besiege the heavily defended city of Ingolstadt, farther down the Danube, with the remainder following two days later.

With Prince Eugene&#x27;s forces at Höchstädt on the north bank of the Danube, and Marlborough&#x27;s at Rain on the south bank, Tallard and Maximilian debated their next move. Tallard preferred to bide his time, replenish supplies and allow Marlborough&#x27;s Danube campaign to flounder in the colder autumn weather; Maximilian and Marsin, newly reinforced, were keen to push ahead. The French and Bavarian commanders eventually agreed to attack Prince Eugene&#x27;s smaller force. On 9 August, the Franco-Bavarian forces began to cross to the north bank of the Danube. On 10 August, Prince Eugene sent an urgent dispatch reporting that he was falling back to Donauwörth. By a series of swift marches Marlborough concentrated his forces on Donauwörth and, by noon 11 August, the link-up was complete.

During 11 August, Tallard pushed forward from the river crossings at Dillingen. By 12 August, the Franco-Bavarian forces were encamped behind the small River Nebel near the village of Blenheim on the plain of Höchstädt. On the same day, Marlborough and Prince Eugene carried out a reconnaissance of the French position from the church spire at Tapfheim, and moved their combined forces to Münster – from the French camp. A French reconnaissance under Jacques Joseph Vipart, Marquis de Silly went forward to probe the enemy, but were driven off by Allied troops who had deployed to cover the pioneers of the advancing army, labouring to bridge the numerous streams in the area and improve the passage leading westwards to Höchstädt. Marlborough quickly moved forward two brigades under the command of Lieutenant General John Wilkes and Brigadier Archibald Rowe to secure the narrow strip of land between the Danube and the wooded Fuchsberg hill, at the Schwenningen defile. Tallard&#x27;s army numbered 56,000 men and 90 guns; the army of the Grand Alliance, 52,000 men and 66 guns. Some Allied officers who were acquainted with the superior numbers of the enemy, and aware of their strong defensive position, remonstrated with Marlborough about the hazards of attacking; but he was resolute – partly because the Dutch officer Willem Vleertman had scouted the marshy ground before them and reported that the land was perfectly suitable for the troops.

==Battle==
===The battlefield===
The battlefield stretched for nearly . The extreme right flank of the Franco-Bavarian army rested on the Danube, the undulating pine-covered hills of the Swabian Jura lay to their left. A small stream, the Nebel, fronted the French line; the ground either side of this was marshy and only fordable intermittently. The French right rested on the village of Blenheim near where the Nebel flows into the Danube; the village itself was surrounded by hedges, fences, enclosed gardens, and meadows. Between Blenheim and the village of Oberglauheim to the north west the fields of wheat had been cut to stubble and were now ideal for the deployment of troops. From Oberglauheim to the next hamlet of Lutzingen the terrain of ditches, thickets and brambles was potentially difficult ground for the attackers.

===Initial manoeuvres===
At 02:00 on 13 August, 40 Allied cavalry squadrons were sent forward, followed at 03:00, in eight columns, by the main Allied force pushing over the River Kessel. At about 06:00 they reached Schwenningen, from Blenheim. The British and German troops who had held Schwenningen through the night joined the march, making a ninth column on the left of the army. Marlborough and Prince Eugene made their final plans. The Allied commanders agreed that Marlborough would command 36,000 troops and attack Tallard&#x27;s force of 33,000 on the left, including capturing the village of Blenheim, while Prince Eugene&#x27;s 16,000 men would attack Maximilian and Marsin&#x27;s combined forces of 23,000 troops on the right. If this attack was pressed hard, it was anticipated that Maximilian and Marsin would feel unable to send troops to aid Tallard on their right. Lieutenant-General John Cutts would attack Blenheim in concert with Prince Eugene&#x27;s attack. With the French flanks busy, Marlborough could cross the Nebel and deliver the fatal blow to the French at their centre. The Allies would have to wait until Prince Eugene was in position before the general engagement could begin.

Tallard was not anticipating an Allied attack; he had been deceived by intelligence gathered from prisoners taken by de Silly the previous day, and his army&#x27;s strong position. Tallard and his colleagues believed that Marlborough and Prince Eugene were about to retreat north-westwards towards Nördlingen. Tallard wrote a report to this effect to King Louis that morning. Signal guns were fired to bring in the foraging parties and pickets as the French and Bavarian troops drew into battle-order to face the unexpected threat.

At around 08:00 the French artillery on their right wing opened fire, answered by Colonel Holcroft Blood&#x27;s batteries. The guns were heard by Prince Louis in his camp before Ingolstadt. An hour later Tallard, Maximilian, and Marsin climbed Blenheim&#x27;s church tower to finalise their plans. It was settled that Maximilian and Marsin would hold the front from the hills to Oberglauheim, whilst Tallard would defend the ground between Oberglauheim and the Danube. The French commanders were divided as to how to utilise the Nebel. Tallard&#x27;s preferred tactic was to lure the Allies across before unleashing his cavalry upon them. This was opposed by Marsin and Maximilian who felt it better to close their infantry right up to the stream itself, so that while the enemy was struggling in the marshes, they would be caught in crossfire from Blenheim and Oberglauheim. Tallard&#x27;s approach was sound if all its parts were implemented, but in the event it allowed Marlborough to cross the Nebel without serious interference and fight the battle he had planned.

===Deployment===
The Franco-Bavarian commanders deployed their forces. In the village of Lutzingen, Count Alessandro de Maffei positioned five Bavarian battalions with a great battery of 16 guns at the village&#x27;s edge. In the woods to the left of Lutzingen, seven French battalions under César Armand, Marquis de Rozel moved into place. Between Lutzingen and Oberglauheim Maximilian placed 27 squadrons of cavalry and 14 Bavarian squadrons commanded by d&#x27;Arco with 13 more in support nearby under Baron Veit Heinrich Moritz Freiherr von Wolframsdorf. To their right stood Marsin&#x27;s 40 French squadrons and 12 battalions. The village of Oberglauheim was packed with 14 battalions commanded by , including the effective Irish Brigade known as the &quot;Wild Geese&quot;. Six batteries of guns were ranged alongside the village. On the right of these French and Bavarian positions, between Oberglauheim and Blenheim, Tallard deployed 64 French and Walloon squadrons, 16 of which were from Marsin, supported by nine French battalions standing near the Höchstädt road. In the cornfield next to Blenheim stood three battalions from the Regiment de Roi. Nine battalions occupied the village itself, commanded by Philippe, Marquis de Clérambault. Four battalions stood to the rear and a further eleven were in reserve. These battalions were supported by Count Gabriel d&#x27;Hautefeuille&#x27;s twelve squadrons of dismounted dragoons. By 11:00 Tallard, Maximilian, and Marsin were in place. Many of the Allied generals were hesitant to attack such a strong position. The Earl of Orkney later said that, &quot;had I been asked to give my opinion, I had been against it.&quot;

Prince Eugene was expected to be in position by 11:00, but due to the difficult terrain and enemy fire, progress was slow. Cutts&#x27; column – which by 10:00 had expelled the enemy from two water mills on the Nebel – had already deployed by the river against Blenheim, enduring over the next three hours severe fire from a six-gun heavy battery posted near the village. The rest of Marlborough&#x27;s army, waiting in their ranks on the forward slope, were also forced to bear the cannonade from the French artillery, suffering 2,000 casualties before the attack could even start. Meanwhile, engineers repaired a stone bridge across the Nebel, and constructed five additional bridges or causeways across the marsh between Blenheim and Oberglauheim. Marlborough&#x27;s anxiety was finally allayed when, just past noon, Colonel William Cadogan reported that Prince Eugene&#x27;s Prussian and Danish infantry were in place – the order for the general advance was given. At 13:00, Cutts was ordered to attack the village of Blenheim whilst Prince Eugene was requested to assault Lutzingen on the Allied right flank.

===Blenheim===
Cutts ordered Rowe&#x27;s brigade to attack. The English infantry rose from the edge of the Nebel, and silently marched towards Blenheim, a distance of some . James Ferguson&#x27;s Scottish brigade supported Rowe&#x27;s left, and moved towards the barricades between the village and the river, defended by Hautefeuille&#x27;s dragoons. As the range closed to within , the French fired a deadly volley. Rowe had ordered that there should be no firing from his men until he struck his sword upon the palisades, but as he stepped forward to give the signal, he fell mortally wounded. The survivors of the leading companies closed up the gaps in their ranks and rushed forward. Small parties penetrated the defences, but repeated French volleys forced the English back and inflicted heavy casualties. As the attack faltered, eight squadrons of elite Gens d&#x27;Armes, commanded by the veteran Swiss officer, , fell on the English troops, cutting at the exposed flank of Rowe&#x27;s own regiment. Wilkes&#x27; Hessian brigade, nearby in the marshy grass at the water&#x27;s edge, stood firm and repulsed the Gens d&#x27;Armes with steady fire, enabling the English and Hessians to re-order and launch another attack.

Although the Allies were again repulsed, these persistent attacks on Blenheim eventually bore fruit, panicking Clérambault into making the worst French error of the day. Without consulting Tallard, Clérambault ordered his reserve battalions into the village, upsetting the balance of the French position and nullifying the French numerical superiority. &quot;The men were so crowded in upon one another&quot;, wrote Mérode-Westerloo, &quot;that they couldn&#x27;t even fire – let alone receive or carry out any orders&quot;. Marlborough, spotting this error, now countermanded Cutts&#x27; intention to launch a third attack, and ordered him simply to contain the enemy within Blenheim; no more than 5,000 Allied soldiers were able to pen in twice the number of French infantry and dragoons.

===Lutzingen===


On the Allied right, Prince Eugene&#x27;s Prussian and Danish forces were desperately fighting the numerically superior forces of Maximilian and Marsin. Leopold I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau led forward four brigades across the Nebel to assault the well-fortified position of Lutzingen. Here, the Nebel was less of an obstacle, but the great battery positioned on the edge of the village enjoyed a good field of fire across the open ground stretching to the hamlet of Schwennenbach. As soon as the infantry crossed the stream, they were struck by Maffei&#x27;s infantry, and salvoes from the Bavarian guns positioned both in front of the village and in enfilade on the wood-line to the right. Despite heavy casualties the Prussians attempted to storm the great battery, whilst the Danes, under Count Jobst von Scholten, attempted to drive the French infantry out of the copses beyond the village.

With the infantry heavily engaged, Prince Eugene&#x27;s cavalry picked its way across the Nebel. After an initial success, his first line of cavalry, under the Imperial General of Horse, Prince Maximilian of Hanover, were pressed by the second line of Marsin&#x27;s cavalry and forced back across the Nebel in confusion. The exhausted French were unable to follow up their advantage, and both cavalry forces tried to regroup and reorder their ranks. Without cavalry support, and threatened with envelopment, the Prussian and Danish infantry were in turn forced to pull back across the Nebel. Panic gripped some of Prince Eugene&#x27;s troops as they crossed the stream. Ten infantry colours were lost to the Bavarians, and hundreds of prisoners taken; it was only through the leadership of Prince Eugene and the Prince Maximilian of Hanover that the Imperial infantry was prevented from abandoning the field.

After rallying his troops near Schwennenbach – well beyond their starting point – Prince Eugene prepared to launch a second attack, led by the second-line squadrons under the Duke of Württemberg-Teck. Yet again they were caught in the murderous crossfire from the artillery in Lutzingen and Oberglauheim, and were once again thrown back in disarray. The French and Bavarians were almost as disordered as their opponents, and they too were in need of inspiration from their commander, Maximilian, who was seen &quot; ... riding up and down, and inspiring his men with fresh courage.&quot; Anhalt-Dessau&#x27;s Danish and Prussian infantry attacked a second time but could not sustain the advance without proper support. Once again they fell back across the stream.

===Centre and Oberglauheim===
Whilst these events around Blenheim and Lutzingen were taking place, Marlborough was preparing to cross the Nebel. Hulsen&#x27;s brigade of Hessians and Hanoverians and the earl of Orkney&#x27;s British brigade advanced across the stream and were supported by dismounted British dragoons and ten British cavalry squadrons. This covering force allowed Charles Churchill&#x27;s Dutch, British and German infantry and further cavalry units to advance and form up on the plain beyond. Marlborough arranged his infantry battalions in a novel manner, with gaps sufficient to allow the cavalry to move freely between them. He ordered the formation forward. Once again Zurlauben&#x27;s Gens d&#x27;Armes charged, looking to rout Henry Lumley&#x27;s English cavalry who linked Cutts&#x27; column facing Blenheim with Churchill&#x27;s infantry. As the elite French cavalry attacked, they were faced by five English squadrons under Colonel Francis Palmes. To the consternation of the French, the Gens d&#x27;Armes were pushed back in confusion and were pursued well beyond the Maulweyer stream that flows through Blenheim. &quot;What? Is it possible?&quot; exclaimed Maximilian, &quot;the gentlemen of France fleeing?&quot; Palmes attempted to follow up his success but was repulsed by other French cavalry and musket fire from the edge of Blenheim.

Nevertheless, Tallard was alarmed by the repulse of the Gens d&#x27;Armes and urgently rode across the field to ask Marsin for reinforcements; but on the basis of being hard pressed by Prince Eugene – whose second attack was in full flood – Marsin refused. As Tallard consulted with Marsin, more of his infantry were taken into Blenheim by Clérambault. Fatally, Tallard, although aware of the situation, did nothing to rectify it, leaving him with just the nine battalions of infantry near the Höchstädt road to oppose the massed enemy ranks in the centre. Zurlauben tried several more times to disrupt the Allies forming on Tallard&#x27;s side of the stream. His front-line cavalry darted forward down the gentle slope towards the Nebel, but the attacks lacked co-ordination, and the Allied infantry&#x27;s steady volleys disconcerted the French horsemen. During these skirmishes Zurlauben fell mortally wounded; he died two days later. At this stage the time was just after 15:00.

The Danish cavalry, under Carl Rudolf, Duke of Württemberg-Neuenstadt, had made slow work of crossing the Nebel near Oberglauheim. Harassed by Marsin&#x27;s infantry near the village, the Danes were driven back across the stream. Count Horn&#x27;s Dutch infantry managed to push the French back from the water&#x27;s edge, but it was apparent that before Marlborough could launch his main effort against Tallard, Oberglauheim would have to be secured.

Count Horn directed Anton Günther, Fürst von Holstein-Beck to take the village, but his two Dutch brigades were cut down by the French and Irish troops, capturing and badly wounding Holstein-Beck during the action. The battle was now in the balance. If Holstein-Beck&#x27;s Dutch column were destroyed, the Allied army would be split in two: Prince Eugene&#x27;s wing would be isolated from Marlborough&#x27;s, passing the initiative to the Franco-Bavarian forces. Seeing the opportunity, Marsin ordered his cavalry to change from facing Prince Eugene, and turn towards their right and the open flank of Churchill&#x27;s infantry drawn up in front of Unterglau. Marlborough, who had crossed the Nebel on a makeshift bridge to take personal control, ordered Hulsen&#x27;s Hanoverian battalions to support the Dutch infantry. A nine-gun artillery battery and a Dutch cavalry brigade under Averock were also called forward, but the cavalry soon came under pressure from Marsin&#x27;s more numerous squadrons.

Marlborough now requested Prince Eugene to release Count Hendrick Fugger and his Imperial Cuirassier brigade to help repel the French cavalry thrust. Despite his own difficulties, Prince Eugene at once complied. Although the Nebel stream lay between Fugger&#x27;s and Marsin&#x27;s squadrons, the French were forced to change front to meet this new threat, thus preventing Marsin from striking at Marlborough&#x27;s infantry. Fugger&#x27;s cuirassiers charged and, striking at a favourable angle, threw back Marsin&#x27;s squadrons in disorder. With support from Blood&#x27;s batteries, the Hessian, Hanoverian and Dutch infantry – now commanded by Count Berensdorf – succeeded in pushing the French and Irish infantry back into Oberglauheim so that they could not again threaten Churchill&#x27;s flank as he moved against Tallard. The French commander in the village, de Blainville, was numbered among the heavy casualties.

===Breakthrough===


By 16:00, with large parts of the Franco-Bavarian army besieged in Blenheim and Oberglau, the Allied centre of 81 squadrons (nine squadrons had been transferred from Cutts&#x27; column) supported by 18 battalions was firmly planted amidst the French line of 64 squadrons and nine battalions of raw recruits. There was now a pause in the battle: Marlborough wanted to attack simultaneously along the whole front, and Prince Eugene, after his second repulse, needed time to reorganise.

By just after 17:00 all was ready along the Allied front. Marlborough&#x27;s two lines of cavalry had now moved to the front of his line of battle, with the two supporting lines of infantry behind them. Mérode-Westerloo attempted to extricate some French infantry crowded into Blenheim, but Clérambault ordered the troops back into the village. The French cavalry exerted themselves once more against the Allied first line – Lumley&#x27;s English and Scots on the Allied left, and Reinhard Vincent Graf von Hompesch&#x27;s Dutch and German squadrons on the Allied right. Tallard&#x27;s squadrons, which lacked infantry support and were tired, managed to push the Allied first line back to their infantry support. With the battle still not won, Marlborough had to rebuke one of his cavalry officers who was attempting to leave the field – &quot;Sir, you are under a mistake, the enemy lies that way ...&quot; Marlborough commanded the second Allied line, under and , to move forward, and, driving through the centre, the Allies finally routed Tallard&#x27;s tired cavalry. The Prussian Life Dragoons&#x27; Colonel, Ludwig von Blumenthal, and his second in command, Lieutenant Colonel von Hacke, fell next to each other, but the charge succeeded. With their cavalry in headlong flight, the remaining nine French infantry battalions fought with desperate valour, trying to form a square, but they were overwhelmed by Blood&#x27;s close-range artillery and platoon fire. Mérode-Westerloo later wrote – &quot;[They] died to a man where they stood, stationed right out in the open plain – supported by nobody.&quot;

The majority of Tallard&#x27;s retreating troops headed for Höchstädt but most did not make the safety of the town, plunging instead into the Danube where over 3,000 French horsemen drowned; others were cut down by the pursuing Allied cavalry. The Marquis de Gruignan attempted a counter-attack, but he was brushed aside by the triumphant Allies. After a final rally behind his camp&#x27;s tents, shouting entreaties to stand and fight, Tallard was caught up in the rout and swept towards Sonderheim. Surrounded by a squadron of Hessian troops, Tallard surrendered to Lieutenant Colonel de Boinenburg, the Prince of Hesse-Kassel&#x27;s &quot;aide-de-camp&quot;, and was sent under escort to Marlborough. Marlborough welcomed the French commander – &quot;I am very sorry that such a cruel misfortune should have fallen upon a soldier for whom I have the highest regard.&quot;

Meanwhile, the Allies had once again attacked the Bavarian stronghold at Lutzingen. Prince Eugene became exasperated with the performance of his Imperial cavalry whose third attack had failed: he had already shot two of his troopers to prevent a general flight. Then, declaring in disgust that he wished to &quot;fight among brave men and not among cowards&quot;, Prince Eugene went into the attack with the Prussian and Danish infantry, as did Leopold I, waving a regimental colour to inspire his troops. This time the Prussians were able to storm the great Bavarian battery, and overwhelm the guns&#x27; crews. Beyond the village, Scholten&#x27;s Danes defeated the French infantry in a desperate hand-to-hand bayonet struggle. When they saw that the centre had broken, Maximilian and Marsin decided the battle was lost; like the remnants of Tallard&#x27;s army, they fled the battlefield, albeit in better order than Tallard&#x27;s men. Attempts to organise an Allied force to prevent Marsin&#x27;s withdrawal failed owing to the exhaustion of the cavalry, and the growing confusion in the field.

===Fall of Blenheim===


Marlborough now turned his attention from the fleeing enemy to direct Churchill to detach more infantry to storm Blenheim. Orkney&#x27;s infantry, Hamilton&#x27;s English brigade and St Paul&#x27;s Hanoverians moved across the trampled wheat to the cottages. Fierce hand-to-hand fighting gradually forced the French towards the village centre, in and around the walled churchyard which had been prepared for defence. Lord John Hay and Charles Ross&#x27;s dismounted dragoons were also sent, but suffered under a counter-charge delivered by the regiments of Artois and Provence under command of Colonel de la Silvière. Colonel Belville&#x27;s Hanoverians were fed into the battle to steady the resolve of the dragoons, who attacked again. The Allied progress was slow and hard, and like the defenders, they suffered many casualties.

Many of the cottages were now burning, obscuring the field of fire and driving the defenders out of their positions. Hearing the din of battle in Blenheim, Tallard sent a message to Marlborough offering to order the garrison to withdraw from the field. &quot;Inform Monsieur Tallard&quot;, replied Marlborough, &quot;that, in the position in which he is now, he has no command.&quot; Nevertheless, as dusk came the Allied commander was anxious for a quick conclusion. The French infantry fought tenaciously to hold on to their position in Blenheim, but their commander was nowhere to be found. By now Blenheim was under assault from every side by three British generals: Cutts, Churchill, and Orkney. The French had repulsed every attack, but many had seen what had happened on the plain: their army was routed and they were cut off. Orkney, attacking from the rear, now tried a different tactic – &quot;... it came into my head to beat parley&quot;, he later wrote, &quot;which they accepted of and immediately their Brigadier de Nouville capitulated with me to be prisoner at discretion and lay down their arms.&quot; Threatened by Allied guns, other units followed their example. It was not until 21:00 that the Marquis de Blanzac, who had taken charge in Clérambault&#x27;s absence, reluctantly accepted the inevitability of defeat, and some 10,000 of France&#x27;s best infantry had laid down their arms.

During these events Marlborough was still in the saddle organising the pursuit of the broken enemy. Pausing for a moment, he scribbled on the back of an old tavern bill a note addressed to his wife, Sarah: &quot;I have no time to say more but to beg you will give my duty to the Queen, and let her know her army has had a glorious victory.&quot;

==Aftermath==

French losses were immense, with over 27,000 killed, wounded and captured. Moreover, the myth of French invincibility had been destroyed, and King Louis&#x27;s hopes of a victorious early peace were over. Mérode-Westerloo summarised the case against Tallard&#x27;s army: It was a hard-fought contest: Prince Eugene observed that &quot;I have not a squadron or battalion which did not charge four times at least.&quot;

Although the war dragged on for years, the Battle of Blenheim was probably its most decisive victory; Marlborough and Prince Eugene had saved the Habsburg Empire and thereby preserved the Grand Alliance from collapse. Munich, Augsburg, Ingolstadt, Ulm and the remaining territory of Bavaria soon fell to the Allies. By the Treaty of Ilbersheim, signed on 7 November, Bavaria was placed under Austrian military rule, allowing the Habsburgs to use its resources for the rest of the conflict.

The remnants of Maximilian and Marsin&#x27;s wing limped back to Strasbourg, losing another 7,000 men through desertion. Despite being offered the chance to remain as ruler of Bavaria, under the strict terms of an alliance with Austria, Maximilian left his country and family in order to continue the war against the Allies from the Spanish Netherlands where he still held the post of governor-general. Tallard – who, unlike his subordinates, was not ransomed or exchanged – was taken to England and imprisoned in Nottingham until his release in 1711.

The 1704 campaign lasted longer than usual, for the Allies sought to extract the maximum advantage. Realising that France was too powerful to be forced to make peace by a single victory, Prince Eugene, Marlborough and Prince Louis met to plan their next moves. For the following year Marlborough proposed a campaign along the valley of the Moselle to carry the war deep into France. This required the capture of the major fortress of Landau which guarded the Rhine, and the towns of Trier and Trarbach on the Moselle itself. Trier was taken on 27 October and Landau fell on 23 November to Prince Louis and Prince Eugene; with the fall of Trarbach on 20 December, the campaign season for 1704 came to an end. The planned offensive never materialised as the Grand Alliance&#x27;s army had to depart the Moselle to defend Liège from a French counteroffensive. The war raged on for another decade.

Marlborough returned to England on 14 December (O.S) to the acclamation of Queen Anne and the country. In the first days of January, the 110 cavalry standards and 128 infantry colours that had been captured during the battle were borne in procession to Westminster Hall. In February 1705, Queen Anne, who had made Marlborough a duke in 1702, granted him the Park of Woodstock Palace and promised a sum of £240,000 to build a suitable house as a gift from a grateful Crown in recognition of his victory; this resulted in the construction of Blenheim Palace. The British historian Sir Edward Shepherd Creasy considered Blenheim one of the pivotal battles in history, writing: &quot;Had it not been for Blenheim, all Europe might at this day suffer under the effect of French conquests resembling those of Alexander in extent and those of the Romans in durability.&quot; The military historian John A. Lynn considers this claim unjustified, for King Louis never had such an objective; the campaign in Bavaria was intended only to bring a favourable peace settlement and not domination over Europe.

Lake Poet Robert Southey criticised the Battle of Blenheim in his anti-war poem &quot;After Blenheim&quot;, but later praised the victory as &quot;the greatest victory which had ever done honour to British arms&quot;.

<text>The Battle of Ramillies (), fought on 23 May 1706, was a battle of the War of the Spanish Succession. For the Grand AllianceAustria, England, and the Dutch Republicthe battle had followed an indecisive campaign against the Bourbon armies of King Louis XIV of France in 1705. Although the Allies had captured Barcelona that year, they had been forced to abandon their campaign on the Moselle, had stalled in the Spanish Netherlands and suffered defeat in northern Italy. Yet despite his opponents&#x27; setbacks LouisXIV wanted peace, but on reasonable terms. Because of this, as well as to maintain their momentum, the French and their allies took the offensive in 1706.

The campaign began well for Louis XIV&#x27;s generals: in Italy Marshal Vendôme defeated the Austrians at the Battle of Calcinato in April, while in Alsace Marshal Villars forced the Margrave of Baden back across the Rhine. Encouraged by these early gains LouisXIV urged Marshal Villeroi to go over to the offensive in the Spanish Netherlands and, with victory, gain a &#x27;fair&#x27; peace. Accordingly, the French Marshal set off from Leuven (&quot;Louvain&quot;) at the head of 60,000 men and marched towards Tienen (&quot;Tirlemont&quot;), as if to threaten Zoutleeuw (&quot;Léau&quot;). Also determined to fight a major engagement, the Duke of Marlborough, commander-in-chief of Anglo-Dutch forces, assembled his armysome 62,000 mennear Maastricht, and marched past Zoutleeuw. With both sides seeking battle, they soon encountered each other on the dry ground between the rivers Mehaigne and Petite Gette, close to the small village of Ramillies.

In less than four hours Marlborough&#x27;s Dutch, English, and Danish forces overwhelmed Villeroi&#x27;s and Max Emanuel&#x27;s Franco-Spanish-Bavarian army. The Duke&#x27;s subtle moves and changes in emphasis during the battlesomething his opponents failed to realise until it was too latecaught the French in a tactical vice. With their foe broken and routed, the Allies were able to fully exploit their victory. Town after town fell, including Brussels, Bruges and Antwerp; by the end of the campaign Villeroi&#x27;s army had been driven from most of the Spanish Netherlands. With Prince Eugene&#x27;s subsequent success at the Battle of Turin in northern Italy, the Allies had imposed the greatest loss of territory and resources that LouisXIV would suffer during the war. Thus, the year 1706 proved, for the Allies, to be an &quot;annus mirabilis&quot;.

==Background==
After their disastrous defeat at Blenheim in 1704, the French found some respite in next year. The Duke of Marlborough had intended the 1705 campaignan invasion of France through the Moselle valleyto complete the work of Blenheim and persuade King LouisXIV to make peace but the plan had been thwarted by friend and foe alike. The reluctance of his Dutch allies to see their frontiers denuded of troops for another gamble in Germany had denied Marlborough the initiative but of far greater importance was the Margrave of Baden&#x27;s pronouncement that he could not join the Duke in strength for the coming offensive. This was in part due to the sudden switching of troops from the Rhine to reinforce Prince Eugene in Italy and part due to the deterioration of Baden&#x27;s health brought on by the re-opening of a severe foot wound he had received at the storming of the Schellenberg the previous year. Marlborough had to cope with the death of Emperor LeopoldI in May and the accession of JosephI, which unavoidably complicated matters for the Grand Alliance.

The resilience of the French king and the efforts of his generals also added to Marlborough&#x27;s problems. Marshal Villeroi, exerting considerable pressure on the Dutch commander, Count Overkirk, along the Meuse, took Huy on 10 June before pressing on towards Liège. With Marshal Villars sitting strong on the Moselle, the Allied commanderwhose supplies had by now become very shortwas forced to call off his campaign on 16 June. &quot;What a disgrace for Marlborough,&quot; exulted Villeroi, &quot;to have made false movements without any result!&quot; With Marlborough&#x27;s departure north, the French transferred troops from the Moselle valley to reinforce Villeroi in Flanders, while Villars marched off to the Rhine.

The Anglo-Dutch forces gained minor compensation for the failed Moselle campaign with the success at Elixheim and the crossing of the Lines of Brabant in the Spanish Netherlands (Huy was also retaken on 11 July) but a chance to bring the French to a decisive engagement eluded Marlborough. The year 1705 proved almost entirely barren for the Duke, whose military disappointments were only partly compensated by efforts on the diplomatic front where, at the courts of Düsseldorf, Frankfurt, Vienna, Berlin and Hanover, Marlborough sought to bolster support for the Grand Alliance and extract promises of prompt assistance for the following year&#x27;s campaign.

==Prelude==
On 11 January 1706 Marlborough finally reached London at the end of his diplomatic tour but he had already been planning his strategy for the coming season. The first option (although it is debatable to what extent the Duke was committed to such an enterprise) was a plan to transfer his forces from the Spanish Netherlands to northern Italy; once there, he intended linking up with Prince Eugene in order to defeat the French and safeguard Savoy from being overrun. Savoy would then serve as a gateway into France by way of the mountain passes or an invasion with naval support along the Mediterranean coast via Nice and Toulon, in connexion with redoubled Allied efforts in Spain. It seems that the Duke&#x27;s favoured scheme was to return to the Moselle valley (where Marshal Marsin had recently taken command of French forces) and once more attempt an advance into the heart of France. But these decisions soon became academic. Shortly after Marlborough landed in the Dutch Republic on 14 April, news arrived of big Allied setbacks in the wider war.

Determined to show the Grand Alliance that France was still resolute, LouisXIV prepared to launch a double surprise in Alsace and northern Italy. On the latter front Marshal Vendôme defeated the Imperial army at Calcinato on 19 April, pushing the Imperialists back in confusion (French forces were now in a position to prepare for the long-anticipated siege of Turin). In Alsace, Marshal Villars took Baden by surprise and captured Haguenau, driving him back across the Rhine in some disorder, thus creating a threat on Landau. With these reverses, the Dutch refused to contemplate Marlborough&#x27;s ambitious march to Italy or any plan that denuded their borders of the Duke and their army. In the interest of coalition harmony, Marlborough prepared to campaign in the Low Countries.

===On the move===
The Duke left The Hague on 9 May. &quot;God knows I go with a heavy heart,&quot; he wrote six days later to his friend and political ally in England, Lord Godolphin, &quot;for I have no hope of doing anything considerable, unless the French do what I am very confident they will not...&quot;in other words, court battle. On 17 May the Duke concentrated his Dutch and English troops at Tongeren, near Maastricht. The Hanoverians, Hessians and Danes, despite earlier undertakings, found, or invented, pressing reasons for withholding their support. Marlborough wrote an appeal to the Duke of Württemberg, the commander of the Danish contingent: &quot;I send you this express to request your Highness to bring forward by a double march your cavalry so as to join us at the earliest moment...&quot; Additionally, the King &quot;in&quot; Prussia, Frederick I, had kept his troops in quarters behind the Rhine while his personal disputes with Vienna and the States General at The Hague remained unresolved. Nevertheless, the Duke could think of no circumstances why the French would leave their strong positions and attack his army, even if Villeroi was first reinforced by substantial transfers from Marsin&#x27;s command. But in this he had miscalculated. Although LouisXIV wanted peace he wanted it on reasonable terms; for that, he needed victory in the field and to convince the Allies that his resources were by no means exhausted.
Following the successes in Italy and along the Rhine, LouisXIV was now hopeful of similar results in Flanders. Far from standing on the defensive thereforeand unbeknown to MarlboroughLouisXIV was persistently goading his marshal into action. &quot;[Villeroi] began to imagine,&quot; wrote St Simon, &quot;that the King doubted his courage, and resolved to stake all at once in an effort to vindicate himself.&quot; Accordingly, on 18 May, Villeroi set off from Leuven at the head of 70 battalions, 132 squadrons and 62 cannoncomprising an overall force of some 60,000 troopsand crossed the river Dyle to seek battle with the enemy. Spurred on by his growing confidence in his ability to out-general his opponent, and by Versailles’ determination to avenge Blenheim, Villeroi and his generals anticipated success.

Neither opponent expected the clash at the exact moment or place where it occurred. The French moved first to Tienen, (as if to threaten Zoutleeuw, abandoned by the French in October 1705), before turning southwards, heading for Jodoignethis line of march took Villeroi&#x27;s army towards the narrow aperture of dry ground between the rivers Mehaigne and Petite Gette close to the small villages of Ramillies and Taviers; but neither commander quite appreciated how far his opponent had travelled. Villeroi still believed (on 22 May) the Allies were a full day&#x27;s march away when in fact they had camped near Corswaren waiting for the Danish squadrons to catch up; for his part, Marlborough deemed Villeroi still at Jodoigne when in reality he was now approaching the plateau of Mont St. André with the intention of pitching camp near Ramillies (see map at right). However, the Prussian infantry was not there. Marlborough wrote to Lord Raby, the English resident at Berlin: &quot;If it should please God to give us victory over the enemy, the Allies will be little obliged to the King [Frederick] for the success.&quot;

The following day, at 01:00, Marlborough dispatched Cadogan, his Quartermaster-General, with an advanced guard to reconnoitre the same dry ground that Villeroi&#x27;s army was now heading toward, country that was well known to the Duke from previous campaigns. Two hours later the Duke followed with the main body: 74 battalions, 123 squadrons, 90 pieces of artillery and 20 mortars, totalling 62,000 troops. About 08:00, after Cadogan had just passed Merdorp, his force made brief contact with a party of French hussars gathering forage on the edge of the plateau of Jandrenouille. After a brief exchange of shots the French retired and Cadogan&#x27;s dragoons pressed forward. With a short lift in the mist, Cadogan soon discovered the smartly ordered lines of Villeroi&#x27;s advance guard some off; a galloper hastened back to warn Marlborough. Two hours later the Duke, accompanied by the Dutch field commander Field Marshal Overkirk, General Daniël van Dopff, and the Allied staff, rode up to Cadogan where on the horizon to the westward he could discern the massed ranks of the French army deploying for battle along the front. Marlborough later told Bishop Burnet: &quot;The French army looked the best of any he had ever seen.&quot;

==Battle==
===Battlefield===
The battlefield of Ramillies is very similar to that of Blenheim, for here too there is an immense area of arable land unimpeded by woods or hedges. Villeroi&#x27;s right rested on the villages of Franquenée and Taviers, with the river Mehaigne protecting his flank. A large open plain, about wide, lay between Taviers and Ramillies, but unlike Blenheim, there was no stream to hinder the cavalry. His centre was secured by Ramillies itself, lying on a slight eminence which gave distant views to the north and east. The French left flank was protected by broken country, and by a stream, the Petite Gheete, which runs deep between steep and slippery slopes. On the French side of the stream the ground rises to Offus, the village which, together with Autre-Eglise farther north, anchored Villeroi&#x27;s left flank. To the west of the Petite Gheete rises the plateau of Mont St. André; a second plain, the plateau of Jandrenouilleupon which the Anglo-Dutch army amassedrises to the east.

===Initial dispositions===
At 11:00 the Duke ordered the army to take standard battle formation. On the far right, towards Foulz, the British battalions and squadrons took up their posts in a double line near the Jeuche stream. The centre was formed by the mass of Dutch, German, Protestant Swiss and Scottish infantryperhaps 30,000 menfacing Offus and Ramillies. Also facing Ramillies Marlborough placed a powerful battery of thirty 24-pounders, dragged into position by a team of oxen; further batteries were positioned overlooking the Petite Gheete. On their left, on the broad plain between Taviers and Ramilliesand where Marlborough thought the decisive encounter must take placeOverkirk drew the 69 squadrons of the Dutch and Danish horse, supported by 19 battalions of Dutch infantry and two artillery pieces.
Meanwhile, Villeroi deployed his forces. In Taviers on his right, he placed two battalions of the Greder Suisse Régiment, with a smaller force forward in Franquenée; the whole position was protected by the boggy ground of the river Mehaigne, thus preventing an Allied flanking movement. In the open country between Taviers and Ramillies, he placed 82 squadrons under General de Guiscard supported by several interleaved brigades of French, Swiss and Bavarian infantry. Along the Ramillies–Offus–Autre Eglise ridge-line, Villeroi positioned Walloon and Bavarian infantry, supported by the Elector of Bavaria&#x27;s 50 squadrons of Bavarian and Walloon cavalry placed behind on the plateau of Mont St. André. Ramillies, Offus and Autre-Eglise were all packed with troops and put in a state of defence, with alleys barricaded and walls loop-holed for muskets. Villeroi also positioned powerful batteries near Ramillies. These guns (some of which were of the three barrelled kind first seen at Elixheim the previous year) enjoyed good arcs of fire, able to fully cover the approaches of the plateau of Jandrenouille over which the Allied infantry would have to pass.

Marlborough, however, noticed several important weaknesses in the French dispositions. Tactically, it was imperative for Villeroi to occupy Taviers on his right and Autre-Eglise on his left, but by adopting this posture he had been forced to over-extend his forces. Moreover, this dispositionconcave in relation to the Allied armygave Marlborough the opportunity to form a more compact line, drawn up in a shorter front between the &#x27;horns&#x27; of the French crescent; when the Allied blow came it would be more concentrated and carry more weight. Additionally, the Duke&#x27;s disposition facilitated the transfer of troops across his front far more easily than his foe, a tactical advantage that would grow in importance as the events of the afternoon unfolded. Although Villeroi had the option of enveloping the flanks of the Allied army as they deployed on the plateau of Jandrenouillethreatening to encircle their armythe Duke correctly gauged that the characteristically cautious French commander was intent on a defensive battle along the ridge-line.

===Taviers===

At 13:00 the batteries went into action; a little later two Allied columns set out from the extremities of their line and attacked the flanks of the Franco-Bavarian army. To the south, 4 Dutch battalions, under the command of Colonel Wertmüller, came forward with their two field guns to seize the hamlet of Franquenée. The small Swiss garrison in the village, shaken by the sudden onslaught and unsupported by the battalions to their rear, were soon compelled back towards the village of Taviers. Taviers was of particular importance to the Franco-Bavarian position: it protected the otherwise unsupported flank of General de Guiscard&#x27;s cavalry on the open plain, while at the same time, it allowed the French infantry to pose a threat to the flanks of the Dutch and Danish squadrons as they came forward into position. But hardly had the retreating Swiss rejoined their comrades in that village when the Dutch Guards renewed their attack. The fighting amongst the alleys and cottages soon deteriorated into a fierce bayonet and clubbing &quot;mêlée&quot;, but the superiority in Dutch firepower soon told. The accomplished French officer, Colonel de la Colonie, standing on the plain nearby remembered: &quot;This village was the opening of the engagement, and the fighting there was almost as murderous as the rest of the battle put together.&quot; By about 15:00 the Swiss had been pushed out of the village into the marshes beyond.
Villeroi&#x27;s right flank fell into chaos and was now open and vulnerable. Alerted to the situation de Guiscard ordered an immediate attack with 14 squadrons of French dragoons currently stationed in the rear. Two other battalions of the Greder Suisse Régiment were also sent, but the attack was poorly co-ordinated and consequently went in piecemeal. The Anglo-Dutch commanders now sent dismounted Dutch dragoons into Taviers, which, together with the Guards and their field guns, poured concentrated musketry- and canister-fire into the advancing French troops. Colonel d’Aubigni, leading his regiment, fell mortally wounded.

As the French ranks wavered, the leading squadrons of Württemberg&#x27;s Danish horsenow unhampered by enemy fire from either villagewere also sent into the attack and fell upon the exposed flank of the Franco-Swiss infantry and dragoons. De la Colonie, with his Grenadiers Rouge regiment, together with the Cologne Guards who were brigaded with them, was now ordered forward from his post south of Ramillies to support the faltering counter-attack on the village. But on his arrival, all was chaos: &quot;Scarcely had my troops got over when the dragoons and Swiss who had preceded us, came tumbling down upon my battalions in full flight... My own fellows turned about and fled along with them.&quot; De La Colonie managed to rally some of his grenadiers, together with the remnants of the French dragoons and Greder Suisse battalions, but it was an entirely peripheral operation, offering only fragile support for Villeroi&#x27;s right flank.

===Offus and Autre-Eglise===
While the attack on Taviers went on the Earl of Orkney launched his first line of English across the Petite Gheete in a determined attack against the barricaded villages of Offus and Autre-Eglise on the Allied right. Villeroi, posting himself near Offus, watched anxiously the redcoats&#x27; advance, mindful of the counsel he had received on 6 May from LouisXIV: &quot;Have particular care to that part of the line which will endure the first shock of the English troops.&quot; Heeding this advice the French commander began to transfer battalions from his centre to reinforce the left, drawing more foot from the already weakened right to replace them.

As the English battalions descended the gentle slope of the Petite Gheete valley, struggling through the boggy stream, they were met by Major General de la Guiche&#x27;s disciplined Walloon infantry sent forward from around Offus. After concentrated volleys, exacting heavy casualties on the redcoats, the Walloons reformed back to the ridgeline in good order. The English took some time to reform their ranks on the dry ground beyond the stream and press on up the slope towards the cottages and barricades on the ridge. The vigour of the English assault, however, was such that they threatened to break through the line of the villages and out onto the open plateau of Mont St André beyond. This was potentially dangerous for the Allied infantry who would then be at the mercy of the Elector&#x27;s Bavarian and Walloon squadrons patiently waiting on the plateau for the order to move.

Although Henry Lumley&#x27;s English cavalry had managed to cross the marshy ground around the Petite Gheete, it was soon evident to Marlborough that sufficient cavalry support would not be practicable and that the battle could not be won on the Allied right. The Duke, therefore, called off the attack against Offus and Autre-Eglise. To make sure that Orkney obeyed his order to withdraw, Marlborough sent his Quartermaster-General in person with the command. Despite Orkney&#x27;s protestations, Cadogan insisted on compliance and, reluctantly, Orkney gave the word for his troops to fall back to their original positions on the edge of the plateau of Jandrenouille. It is still not clear how far Orkney&#x27;s advance was planned only as a feint; according to historian David Chandler it is probably more accurate to surmise that Marlborough launched Orkney in a serious probe with a view to sounding out the possibilities of the sector. Nevertheless, the attack had served its purpose. Villeroi had given his personal attention to that wing and strengthened it with large bodies of horse and foot that ought to have been taking part in the decisive struggle south of Ramillies.

===Ramillies===
Meanwhile, the Dutch assault on Ramillies was gaining pace. Marlborough&#x27;s younger brother, General of Infantry Charles Churchill, ordered four brigades of foot to attack the village. The assault consisted of 12 battalions of Dutch infantry commanded by Major Generals Scholten and Sparre; two brigades of Saxons under Count Schulenburg; a Scottish brigade in Dutch service led by the 2nd Duke of Argyle; and a small brigade of Protestant Swiss. The 20 French and Bavarian battalions in Ramillies, supported by the Irish who had left Ireland in the Flight of the Wild Geese to join Clare&#x27;s Dragoons who fought as infantry and captured a colour from the British 3rd Regiment of Foot and a small brigade of Cologne and Bavarian Guards under the Marquis de Maffei, put up a determined defence, initially driving back the attackers with severe losses as commemorated in the song &quot;Clare&#x27;s Dragoons&quot;.

Seeing that Scholten and Sparre were faltering, Marlborough now ordered Orkney&#x27;s second-line British and Danish battalions (who had not been used in the assault on Offus and Autre-Eglise) to move south towards Ramillies. Shielded as they were from observation by a slight fold in the land, their commander, Brigadier-General Van Pallandt, ordered the regimental colours to be left in place on the edge of the plateau to convince their opponents they were still in their initial position. Therefore, unbeknown to the French who remained oblivious to the Allies&#x27; real strength and intentions on the opposite side of the Petite Gheete, Marlborough was throwing his full weight against Ramillies and the open plain to the south. Villeroi meanwhile, was still moving more reserves of infantry in the opposite direction towards his left flank; crucially, it would be some time before the French commander noticed the subtle change in emphasis of the Allied dispositions.
Around 15:30 Overkirk advanced his massed squadrons on the open plain in support of the infantry attack on Ramillies. 48 Dutch squadrons, supported on their left by 21 Danish squadrons, led by Count Tilly and Lieutenants Generals Hompesch, d&#x27;Auvergne, Ostfriesland and Dopffsteadily advanced towards the enemy (taking care not to prematurely tire the horses), before breaking into a trot to gain the impetus for their charge. The Marquis de Feuquières writing after the battle described the scene: &quot;They advanced in four lines... As they approached they advanced their second and fourth lines into the intervals of their first and third lines; so that when they made their advance upon us, they formed only one front, without any intermediate spaces.&quot; This made it nearly impossible for the French cavalry to perform flanking manoeuvres.

The initial clash favoured the Dutch and Danish squadrons. The disparity of numbersexacerbated by Villeroi stripping their ranks of infantry to reinforce his left flankenabled Overkirk&#x27;s cavalry to throw the first line of French horse back in some disorder towards their second-line squadrons. This line also came under severe pressure and, in turn, was forced back to their third-line of cavalry and the few battalions still remaining on the plain. But these French horsemen were amongst the best in LouisXIV&#x27;s armythe &quot;Maison du Roi&quot;, supported by four elite squadrons of Bavarian Cuirassiers. Ably led by de Guiscard, the French cavalry rallied, thrusting back the Allied squadrons in successful local counterattacks. On Overkirk&#x27;s right flank, close to Ramillies, ten of his squadrons suddenly broke ranks and were scattered, riding headlong to the rear to recover their order, leaving the left flank of the Allied assault on Ramillies dangerously exposed. Notwithstanding the lack of infantry support, de Guiscard threw his cavalry forward in an attempt to split the Allied army in two.
A crisis threatened the centre, but from his vantage point Marlborough was at once aware of the situation. The Allied commander now summoned the cavalry on the right wing to reinforce his centre, leaving only the English squadrons in support of Orkney. Thanks to a combination of battle-smoke and favourable terrain, his redeployment went unnoticed by Villeroi who made no attempt to transfer any of his own 50 unused squadrons. While he waited for the fresh reinforcements to arrive, Marlborough flung himself into the &quot;mêlée&quot;, rallying some of the Dutch cavalry who were in confusion. But his personal involvement nearly led to his undoing. A number of French horsemen, recognising the Duke, came surging towards his party. Marlborough&#x27;s horse tumbled and the Duke was thrown&quot;Milord Marlborough was rid over,&quot; wrote Orkney some time later. It was a critical moment of the battle. &quot;Major-General Murray,&quot; recalled one eyewitness: &quot;...seeing him fall, marched up in all haste with two Swiss battalions to save him and stop the enemy who were hewing all down in their way.&quot; Samuel Constant de Rebecque helped Marlborough back on his feet, while Marlborough&#x27;s newly appointed aide-de-camp, Richard Molesworth, galloped to the rescue, mounted the Duke on his horse and made good their escape, before Murray&#x27;s disciplined ranks threw back the pursuing French troopers.

After a brief pause, Marlborough&#x27;s equerry, Colonel Bringfield (or Bingfield), led up another of the Duke&#x27;s spare horses; but while assisting him onto his mount, the unfortunate Bringfield was hit by an errant cannonball that sheared off his head. One account has it that the cannonball flew between the Captain-General&#x27;s legs before hitting the unfortunate colonel, whose torso fell at Marlborough&#x27;s feeta moment subsequently depicted in a lurid set of contemporary playing cards. Nevertheless, the danger passed and Overkirk and Tilly restored order among the confused squadrons and ordered them to attack again, enabling the Duke to attend to the positioning of the cavalry reinforcements feeding down from his right flanka change of which Villeroi remained blissfully unaware.

===Breakthrough===
The time was about 16:30, and the two armies were in close contact across the whole front, from the skirmishing in the marshes in the south, through the vast cavalry battle on the open plain; to the fierce struggle for Ramillies at the centre, and to the north, where, around the cottages of Offus and Autre-Eglise, Orkney and de la Guiche faced each other across the Petite Gheete ready to renew hostilities.

The arrival of the transferring squadrons now began to tip the balance in favour of the Allies. Tired, and suffering a growing list of casualties, the numerical inferiority of Guiscard&#x27;s squadrons battling on the plain at last began to tell. After earlier failing to hold or retake Franquenée and Taviers, Guiscard&#x27;s right flank had become dangerously exposed and a fatal gap had opened on the right of their line. Taking advantage of this breach, Württemberg&#x27;s Danish cavalry now swept forward, wheeling to penetrate the flank of the Maison du Roi whose attention was almost entirely fixed on holding back the Dutch. Sweeping forwards, virtually without resistance, the 21 Danish squadrons reformed behind the French around the area of the Tomb of Ottomond, facing north across the plateau of Mont St André towards the exposed flank of Villeroi&#x27;s army.

The final Allied reinforcements for the cavalry contest to the south were at last in position; Marlborough&#x27;s superiority on the left could no longer be denied, and his fast-moving plan took hold of the battlefield. Now, far too late, Villeroi tried to redeploy his 50 unused squadrons, but a desperate attempt to form line facing south, stretching from Offus to Mont St André, floundered amongst the baggage and tents of the French camp carelessly left there after the initial deployment. The Allied commander ordered his cavalry forward against the now heavily outnumbered French and Bavarian horsemen. De Guiscard&#x27;s right flank, without proper infantry support, could no longer resist the onslaught and, turning their horses northwards, they broke and fled in complete disorder. Even the squadrons currently being scrambled together by Villeroi behind Ramillies could not withstand the onslaught. &quot;We had not got forty yards on our retreat,&quot; remembered Captain Peter Drake, an Irishman serving with the French&quot;when the words &quot;sauve qui peut&quot; went through the great part, if not the whole army, and put all to confusion&quot;

In Ramillies the Allied infantry, now reinforced by the English troops brought down from the north, at last broke through. The Régiment de Picardie stood their ground but were caught between Colonel Borthwick&#x27;s Scots-Dutch regiment and the English reinforcements. Borthwick was killed, as was Charles O’Brien, the Irish Viscount Clare in French service, fighting at the head of his regiment. The Marquis de Maffei attempted one last stand with his Bavarian and Cologne Guards, but it proved in vain. Noticing a rush of horsemen fast approaching from the south, he later recalled: &quot;...I went towards the nearest of these squadrons to instruct their officer, but instead of being listened to [I] was immediately surrounded and called upon to ask for quarter.&quot;

===Pursuit===
The roads leading north and west were choked with fugitives. Orkney now sent his English troops back across the Petite Gheete stream to once again storm Offus where de la Guiche&#x27;s infantry had begun to drift away in the confusion. To the right of the infantry Lord John Hay&#x27;s &#x27;Scots Greys&#x27; also picked their way across the stream and charged the Régiment du Roi within Autre-Eglise. &quot;Our dragoons,&quot; wrote John Deane, &quot;pushing into the village... made terrible slaughter of the enemy.&quot; The Bavarian Horse Grenadiers and the Electoral Guards withdrew and formed a shield about Villeroi and the Elector but were scattered by Lumley&#x27;s cavalry. Stuck in the mass of fugitives fleeing the battlefield, the French and Bavarian commanders narrowly escaped capture by General Cornelius Wood who, unaware of their identity, had to content himself with the seizure of two Bavarian Lieutenant-Generals. Far to the south, the remnants of de la Colonie&#x27;s brigade headed in the opposite direction towards the French held fortress of Namur.

The retreat became a rout. Individual Allied commanders drove their troops forward in pursuit, allowing their beaten enemy no chance to recover. Soon the Allied infantry could no longer keep up, but their cavalry were off the leash, heading through the gathering night for the crossings on the river Dyle. At last, however, Marlborough called a halt to the pursuit shortly after midnight near Meldert, from the field. &quot;It was indeed a truly shocking sight to see the miserable remains of this mighty army,&quot; wrote Captain Drake, &quot;...reduced to a handful.&quot;

==Aftermath==


What was left of Villeroi&#x27;s army was now broken in spirit; the imbalance of the casualty figures amply demonstrates the extent of the disaster for LouisXIV&#x27;s army: (&quot;see below&quot;). In addition, hundreds of French soldiers were fugitives, many of whom would never remuster to the colours. Villeroi also lost 52 artillery pieces and his entire engineer pontoon train. In the words of Marshal Villars, the French defeat at Ramillies was &quot;the most shameful, humiliating and disastrous of routs&quot;.

Town after town now succumbed to the Allies. Leuven fell on 25 May 1706; three days later, the Allies entered Brussels, the capital of the Spanish Netherlands. Marlborough realised the great opportunity created by the early victory of Ramillies: &quot;We now have the whole summer before us,&quot; wrote the Duke from Brussels to Robert Harley: &quot;...and with the blessing of God I shall make the best use of it.&quot; Malines, Lierre, Ghent, Alost, Damme, Oudenaarde, Bruges, and on 6 June Antwerp, all subsequently fell to Marlborough&#x27;s victorious army and, like Brussels, proclaimed the Austrian candidate for the Spanish throne, the Archduke Charles, as their sovereign. Villeroi was helpless to arrest the process of collapse. When LouisXIV learnt of the disaster he recalled Marshal Vendôme from northern Italy to take command in Flanders; but it would be weeks before the command changed hands.
As news spread of the Allies&#x27; triumph, the Prussians, Hessians and Hanoverian contingents, long delayed by their respective rulers, eagerly joined the pursuit of the broken French and Bavarian forces. &quot;This,&quot; wrote Marlborough wearily, &quot;I take to be owing to our late success.&quot; Meanwhile, Overkirk took the port of Ostend on 4 July thus opening a direct route to the English Channel for communication and supply, but the Allies were making scant progress against Dendermonde whose governor, the Marquis de Valée, was stubbornly resisting. Only later when Cadogan and Churchill went to take charge did the town&#x27;s defences begin to fail.

Vendôme formally took over command in Flanders on 4 August; Villeroi would never again receive a major command: &quot;I cannot foresee a happy day in my life save only that of my death.&quot; LouisXIV was more forgiving to his old friend: &quot;At our age, Marshal, we must no longer expect good fortune.&quot; In the meantime, Marlborough invested the elaborate fortress of Menin which, after a costly siege, capitulated on 22 August. Dendermonde finally succumbed on 6 September followed by Aththe last conquest of 1706on 2 October. By the time Marlborough had closed down the Ramillies campaign he had denied the French most of the Spanish Netherlands west of the Meuse and north of the Sambreit was an unsurpassed operational triumph for the English Duke but once again it was not decisive as these gains did not defeat France.

The immediate question for the Allies was how to deal with the Spanish Netherlands, a subject on which the Austrians and the Dutch were diametrically opposed. Emperor JosephI, acting on behalf of his younger brother King CharlesIII, absent in Spain, claimed that reconquered Brabant and Flanders should be put under immediate possession of a governor named by himself. The Dutch, however, who had supplied the major share of the troops and money to secure the victory (the Austrians had produced nothing of either) claimed the government of the region till the war was over, and that after the peace they should continue to garrison Barrier Fortresses stronger than those which had fallen so easily to LouisXIV&#x27;s forces in 1701. Marlborough mediated between the two parties but favoured the Dutch position. To sway the Duke&#x27;s opinion, the Emperor offered Marlborough the governorship of the Spanish Netherlands. It was a tempting offer, but in the name of Allied unity, it was one he refused. In the end England and the Dutch Republic took control of the newly won territory for the duration of the war; after which it was to be handed over to the direct rule of CharlesIII, subject to the reservation of a Dutch Barrier, the extent and nature of which had yet to be settled.

Meanwhile, on the Upper Rhine, Villars had been forced onto the defensive as battalion after battalion had been sent north to bolster collapsing French forces in Flanders; there was now no possibility of his undertaking the re-capture of Landau. Further good news for the Allies arrived from northern Italy where, on 7 September, Prince Eugene had routed a French army before the Piedmontese capital, Turin, driving the Franco-Spanish forces from northern Italy. Only from Spain did LouisXIV receive any good news where Das Minas and Galway had been forced to retreat from Madrid towards Valencia, allowing PhilipV to re-enter his capital on 4 October. All in all though, the situation had changed considerably and LouisXIV began to look for ways to end what was fast becoming a ruinous war for France. For Queen Anne also, the Ramillies campaign had one overriding significance: &quot;Now we have God be thanked so hopeful a prospect of peace.&quot; Instead of continuing the momentum of victory, however, cracks in Allied unity would enable LouisXIV to reverse some of the major setbacks suffered at Turin and Ramillies.

==Casualties==
The total number of French casualties cannot be calculated precisely, so complete was the collapse of the Franco-Bavarian army that day. David G. Chandler&#x27;s &quot;Marlborough as Military Commander&quot; and &quot;A Guide to the Battlefields of Europe&quot; are consistent with regards to French casualty figures, i.e. 12,000 dead and wounded plus some 7,000 taken prisoner. James Falkner, in &quot;Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles&quot;, also notes 12,000 dead and wounded and &quot;up to 10,000&quot; taken prisoner. In &quot;Notes on the history of military medicine&quot;, Garrison puts French casualties at 13,000, including 2,000 killed, 3,000 wounded and 6,000 missing. In &quot;The Collins Encyclopaedia of Military History&quot;, Dupuy puts Villeroi&#x27;s dead and wounded at 8,000, with a further 7,000 captured. Neil Litten, using French archives, suggests 7,000 killed and wounded and 6,000 captured, with a further 2,000 choosing to desert. John Millner&#x27;s memoirs&quot;Compendious Journal&quot; (1733)is more specific, recording 12,087 of Villeroi&#x27;s army were killed or wounded, with another 9,729 taken prisoner. In &quot;Marlborough&quot;, however, Correlli Barnett puts the total casualty figure as high as 30,000–15,000 dead and wounded with an additional 15,000 taken captive. Trevelyan estimates Villeroi&#x27;s casualties at 13,000 but adds &quot;his losses by desertion may have doubled that number&quot;. La Colonie omits a casualty figure in his &quot;Chronicles of an old Campaigner&quot; but Saint-Simon in his &quot;Memoirs&quot; states 4,000 killed adding &quot;many others were wounded and many important persons were taken prisoner&quot;. Voltaire, however, in &quot;Histoire du siècle du LouisXIV&quot; records &quot;the French lost there twenty thousand men&quot;. Gaston Bodart states 2,000 killed or wounded, 6,000 captured and 7,000 scattered for a total of 13,000 casualties. Périni writes that both sides lost 2 to 3,000 killed or wounded (the Dutch losing precisely 716 killed and 1,712 wounded), and that 5,600 French were captured.

<text>Brian Wilson Kernighan (; born January 30, 1942) is a Canadian computer scientist.
He worked at Bell Labs and contributed to the development of Unix alongside Unix creators Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie. Kernighan&#x27;s name became widely known through co-authorship of the first book on the C programming language (&quot;The C Programming Language&quot;) with Dennis Ritchie. Kernighan affirmed that he had no part in the design of the C language (&quot;it&#x27;s entirely Dennis Ritchie&#x27;s work&quot;).

Kernighan authored many Unix programs, including ditroff. He is coauthor of the AWK and AMPL programming languages. The &quot;K&quot; of K&amp;R C and of AWK both stand for &quot;Kernighan&quot;.

In collaboration with Shen Lin he devised well-known heuristics for two NP-complete optimization problems: graph partitioning and the travelling salesman problem. In a display of authorial equity, the former is usually called the Kernighan–Lin algorithm, while the latter is known as the Lin–Kernighan heuristic.

Kernighan has been a professor of computer science at Princeton University since 2000 and is the director of undergraduate studies in the department of computer science. In 2015, he co-authored the book &quot;The Go Programming Language.

==Early life and education==

Kernighan was born in Toronto. He attended the University of Toronto between 1960 and 1964, earning his bachelor&#x27;s degree in engineering physics. He received his Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Princeton University in 1969, completing a doctoral dissertation titled &quot;Some graph partitioning problems related to program segmentation&quot; under the supervision of Peter G. Weiner.

==Career and research==
Kernighan has held a professorship in the department of computer science at Princeton since 2000. Each fall he teaches a course called &quot;Computers in Our World&quot;, which introduces the fundamentals of computing to non-majors.

Kernighan was the software editor for Prentice Hall International. His &quot;Software Tools&quot; series spread the essence of &quot;C/Unix thinking&quot; with makeovers for BASIC, FORTRAN, and Pascal, and most notably his &quot;Ratfor&quot; (rational FORTRAN) was put in the public domain.

He has said that if stranded on an island with only one programming language it would have to be C.

Kernighan coined the term &quot;Unix&quot; and helped popularize Thompson&#x27;s Unix philosophy. Kernighan is also known for coining the expression &quot;What You See Is All You Get&quot; (WYSIAYG), which is a sarcastic variant of the original &quot;What You See Is What You Get&quot; (WYSIWYG). Kernighan&#x27;s term is used to indicate that WYSIWYG systems might throw away information in a document that could be useful in other contexts.

In 1972, Kernighan described memory management in strings using &quot;hello&quot; and &quot;world&quot;, in the B programming language, which became the iconic example we know today. Kernighan&#x27;s original 1978 implementation of was sold at The Algorithm Auction, the world&#x27;s first auction of computer algorithms.

In 1996, Kernighan taught CS50 which is the Harvard University introductory course in computer science. Kernighan was an influence on David J. Malan who subsequently taught the course and scaled it up to run at multiple universities and in multiple digital formats.

Kernighan was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 2002 for contributions to software and to programming languages. He was also elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2019.

In 2022, Kernighan stated that he was actively working on improvements to the AWK programming language, which he took part in creating in 1977.

<text>BCPL (&quot;Basic Combined Programming Language&quot;) is a procedural, imperative, and structured programming language. Originally intended for writing compilers for other languages, BCPL is no longer in common use. However, its influence is still felt because a stripped down and syntactically changed version of BCPL, called B, was the language on which the C programming language was based. BCPL introduced several features of many modern programming languages, including using curly braces to delimit code blocks. BCPL was first implemented by Martin Richards of the University of Cambridge in 1967.

==Design==
BCPL was designed so that small and simple compilers could be written for it; reputedly some compilers could be run in 16 kilobytes. Furthermore, the original compiler, itself written in BCPL, was easily portable. BCPL was thus a popular choice for bootstrapping a system. A major reason for the compiler&#x27;s portability lay in its structure. It was split into two parts: the front end parsed the source and generated O-code, an intermediate language. The back end took the O-code and translated it into the machine code for the target machine. Only of the compiler&#x27;s code needed to be rewritten to support a new machine, a task that usually took between 2 and 5 person-months. This approach became common practice later (e.g. Pascal, Java).

The language is unusual in having only one data type: a word, a fixed number of bits, usually chosen to align with the same platform architecture&#x27;s machine word and of adequate capacity to represent any valid storage address. For many machines of the time, this data type was a 16-bit word. This choice later proved to be a significant problem when BCPL was used on machines in which the smallest addressable item was not a word but a byte or on machines with larger word sizes such as 32-bit or 64-bit.

The interpretation of any value was determined by the operators used to process the values. (For example, codice_1 added two values together, treating them as integers; codice_2 indirected through a value, effectively treating it as a pointer.) In order for this to work, the implementation provided no type checking.

The mismatch between BCPL&#x27;s word orientation and byte-oriented hardware was addressed in several ways. One was by providing standard library routines for packing and unpacking words into byte strings. Later, two language features were added: the bit-field selection operator and the infix byte indirection operator (denoted by codice_3).

BCPL handles bindings spanning separate compilation units in a unique way. There are no user-declarable global variables; instead, there is a global vector, similar to &quot;blank common&quot; in Fortran. All data shared between different compilation units comprises scalars and pointers to vectors stored in a pre-arranged place in the global vector. Thus, the header files (files included during compilation using the &quot;GET&quot; directive) become the primary means of synchronizing global data between compilation units, containing &quot;GLOBAL&quot; directives that present lists of symbolic names, each paired with a number that associates the name with the corresponding numerically addressed word in the global vector. As well as variables, the global vector contains bindings for external procedures. This makes dynamic loading of compilation units very simple to achieve. Instead of relying on the link loader of the underlying implementation, effectively, BCPL gives the programmer control of the linking process.

The global vector also made it very simple to replace or augment standard library routines. A program could save the pointer from the global vector to the original routine and replace it with a pointer to an alternative version. The alternative might call the original as part of its processing. This could be used as a quick &quot;ad hoc&quot; debugging aid.

BCPL was the first brace programming language and the braces survived the syntactical changes and have become a common means of denoting program source code statements. In practice, on limited keyboards of the day, source programs often used the sequences codice_4 and codice_5 or codice_6 and codice_7 in place of the symbols codice_8 and codice_9. The single-line codice_10 comments of BCPL, which were not adopted by C, reappeared in C++ and later in C99.

The book &quot;BCPL: The language and its compiler&quot; describes the philosophy of BCPL as follows:
==History==
BCPL was first implemented by Martin Richards of the University of Cambridge in 1967. BCPL was a response to difficulties with its predecessor, Cambridge Programming Language, later renamed Combined Programming Language (CPL), which was designed during the early 1960s. Richards created BCPL by &quot;removing those features of the full language which make compilation difficult&quot;. The first compiler implementation, for the IBM 7094 under Compatible Time-Sharing System, was written while Richards was visiting Project MAC at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the spring of 1967. The language was first described in a paper presented to the 1969 Spring Joint Computer Conference.

BCPL has been rumored to have originally stood for &quot;Bootstrap Cambridge Programming Language&quot;, but CPL was never created since development stopped at BCPL, and the acronym was later reinterpreted for the BCPL book.

BCPL is the language in which the original &quot;Hello, World!&quot; program was written. The first MUD was also written in BCPL (&quot;MUD1&quot;).

Several operating systems were written partially or wholly in BCPL (for example, TRIPOS and the earliest versions of AmigaDOS). BCPL was also the initial language used in the Xerox PARC Alto project. Among other projects, the Bravo document preparation system was written in BCPL.

An early compiler, bootstrapped in 1969, by starting with a paper tape of the O-code of Richards&#x27;s Atlas 2 compiler, targeted the ICT 1900 series. The two machines had different word-lengths (48 vs 24 bits), different character encodings, and different packed string representations—and the successful bootstrapping increased confidence in the practicality of the method.

By late 1970, implementations existed for the Honeywell 635 and Honeywell 645, IBM 360, PDP-10, TX-2, CDC 6400, UNIVAC 1108, PDP-9, KDF 9 and Atlas 2. In 1974 a dialect of BCPL was implemented at BBN without using the intermediate O-code. The initial implementation was a cross-compiler hosted on BBN&#x27;s TENEX PDP-10s, and directly targeted the PDP-11s used in BBN&#x27;s implementation of the second generation IMPs used in the ARPANET.

There was also a version produced for the BBC Micro in the mid-1980s, by Richards Computer Products, a company started by John Richards, the brother of Martin Richards. The BBC Domesday Project made use of the language. Versions of BCPL for the Amstrad CPC and Amstrad PCW computers were also released in 1986 by UK software house Arnor Ltd. MacBCPL was released for the Apple Macintosh in 1985 by Topexpress Ltd, of Kensington, England.

Both the design and philosophy of BCPL strongly influenced B, which in turn influenced C. Programmers at the time debated whether an eventual successor to C would be called &quot;D&quot;, the next letter in the alphabet, or &quot;P&quot;, the next letter in the parent language name. The language most accepted as being C&#x27;s successor is C++ (with codice_11 being C&#x27;s increment operator), although meanwhile, a D programming language also exists.

In 1979, implementations of BCPL existed for at least 25 architectures; the language gradually fell out of favour as C became popular on non-Unix systems.

Martin Richards maintains a modern version of BCPL on his website, last updated in 2023. This can be set up to run on various systems including Linux, FreeBSD, and Mac OS X. The latest distribution includes graphics and sound libraries, and there is a comprehensive manual. He continues to program in it, including for his research on musical automated score following.

A common informal MIME type for BCPL is .

==Examples==
=== Hello world ===
Richards and Whitby-Strevens provide an example of the &quot;Hello, World!&quot; program for BCPL using a standard system header, &#x27;LIBHDR&#x27;:
=== Further examples ===

If these programs are run using Richards&#x27; current version of Cintsys (December 2018), LIBHDR, START and WRITEF must be changed to lower case to avoid errors.

<doc id="4054" wikidata="Q182531" url="?curid=4054" title="Battleship">
<text>A battleship is a large, heavily armored warship with a main battery consisting of large guns, designed to serve as capital ships. From their advent in the 1880s, battleships were among the largest and most formidable weapon systems ever built, until they were surpassed by aircraft carriers beginning in the 1940s.

The term &quot;battleship&quot; came into use in the late 1880s to describe a type of ironclad warship, now referred to as pre-dreadnought battleships. In 1906, the commissioning of into the United Kingdom&#x27;s Royal Navy heralded a revolution in the field of battleship design. Subsequent battleship designs, influenced by HMS &quot;Dreadnought&quot;, were referred to as &quot;dreadnoughts&quot;, though the term eventually became obsolete as dreadnoughts became the only type of battleship in common use.

Battleships dominated naval warfare in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and were a symbol of naval dominance and national might, and for decades were a major intimidation factor for power projection in both diplomacy and military strategy. A global arms race in battleship construction began in Europe in the 1890s and culminated at the decisive Battle of Tsushima in 1905, the outcome of which significantly influenced the design of HMS &quot;Dreadnought&quot;. The launch of &quot;Dreadnought&quot; in 1906 commenced a new naval arms race. Three major fleet actions between steel battleships took place: the long-range gunnery duel at the Battle of the Yellow Sea in 1904, the decisive Battle of Tsushima in 1905 (both during the Russo-Japanese War) and the inconclusive Battle of Jutland in 1916, during World War I. Jutland was the largest naval battle and the only full-scale clash of dreadnoughts of the war, and it was the last major battle in naval history fought primarily by battleships.

The Naval Treaties of the 1920s and 1930s limited the number of battleships, though technical innovation in battleship design continued. Both the Allied and Axis powers built battleships during World War II, though the increasing importance of the aircraft carrier meant that the battleship played a less important role than had been expected in that conflict.

The value of the battleship has been questioned, even during their heyday. There were few of the decisive fleet battles that battleship proponents expected and used to justify the vast resources spent on building battlefleets. Even in spite of their huge firepower and protection, battleships were increasingly vulnerable to much smaller and relatively inexpensive weapons: initially the torpedo and the naval mine, and later attack aircraft and the guided missile. The growing range of naval engagements led to the aircraft carrier replacing the battleship as the leading capital ship during World War II, with the last battleship to be launched being in 1944. Four battleships were retained by the United States Navy until the end of the Cold War for fire support purposes and were last used in combat during the Gulf War in 1991, and then struck from the U.S. Naval Vessel Register in the 2000s. Many World War II-era American battleships survive today as museum ships.

==History==
===Ships of the line===

A ship of the line was a large, unarmored wooden sailing ship which mounted a battery of up to 120 smoothbore guns and carronades, which came to prominence with the adoption of line of battle tactics in the early 17th century. From 1794, the alternative term &#x27;line of battle ship&#x27; was contracted (informally at first) to &#x27;battle ship&#x27; or &#x27;battleship&#x27;.

The sheer number of guns fired broadside meant a ship of the line could wreck any wooden enemy, holing her hull, knocking down masts, wrecking her rigging, and killing her crew. However, the effective range of the guns was as little as a few hundred yards, so the battle tactics of sailing ships depended in part on the wind.

Over time, ships of the line gradually became larger and carried more guns, but otherwise remained quite similar. The first major change to the ship of the line concept was the introduction of steam power as an auxiliary propulsion system. Steam power was gradually introduced to the navy in the first half of the 19th century, initially for small craft and later for frigates. The French Navy introduced steam to the line of battle with the 90-gun in 1850—the first true steam battleship. &quot;Napoléon&quot; was armed as a conventional ship-of-the-line, but her steam engines could give her a speed of , regardless of the wind. This was a potentially decisive advantage in a naval engagement. The introduction of steam accelerated the growth in size of battleships. France and the United Kingdom were the only countries to develop fleets of wooden steam screw battleships although several other navies operated small numbers of screw battleships, including Russia (9), the Ottoman Empire (3), Sweden (2), Naples (1), Denmark (1) and Austria (1).

===Ironclads===

The adoption of steam power was only one of a number of technological advances which revolutionized warship design in the 19th century. The ship of the line was overtaken by the ironclad: powered by steam, protected by metal armor, and armed with guns firing high-explosive shells.

====Explosive shells====
Guns that fired explosive or incendiary shells were a major threat to wooden ships, and these weapons quickly became widespread after the introduction of the Paixhans gun (and its derivatives such as the Dahlgren gun) as part of the standard armament of French and American line-of-battle ships in 1841. In the Crimean War, six line-of-battle ships and two frigates of the Russian Black Sea Fleet destroyed seven Turkish frigates and three corvettes with explosive shells at the Battle of Sinop in 1853. Later in the war, French ironclad floating batteries used similar weapons against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn.

Nevertheless, wooden-hulled ships stood up comparatively well to shells, as shown in the 1866 Battle of Lissa, where the modern Austrian steam two-decker ranged across a confused battlefield, rammed an Italian ironclad and took 80 hits from Italian ironclads, many of which were shells, but including at least one shot at point-blank range. Despite losing her bowsprit and her foremast, and being set on fire, she was ready for action again the very next day.

====Iron armor and construction====
The development of high-explosive shells made the use of iron armor plate on warships necessary. In 1859 France launched , the first ocean-going ironclad warship. She had the profile of a ship of the line, cut to one deck due to weight considerations. Although made of wood and reliant on sail for most journeys, &quot;Gloire&quot; was fitted with a propeller, and her wooden hull was protected by a layer of thick iron armor. &quot;Gloire&quot; prompted further innovation from the Royal Navy, anxious to prevent France from gaining a technological lead.

The superior armored frigate followed &quot;Gloire&quot; by only 14 months, and both nations embarked on a program of building new ironclads and converting existing screw ships of the line to armored frigates. Within two years, Italy, Austria, Spain and Russia had all ordered ironclad warships, and by the time of the famous clash of the and the at the Battle of Hampton Roads at least eight navies possessed ironclad ships.

Navies experimented with the positioning of guns, in turrets (like the USS &quot;Monitor&quot;), central-batteries or barbettes, or with the ram as the principal weapon. As steam technology developed, masts were gradually removed from battleship designs. By the mid-1870s steel was used as a construction material alongside iron and wood. The French Navy&#x27;s , laid down in 1873 and launched in 1876, was a central battery and barbette warship which became the first battleship in the world to use steel as the principal building material.

===Pre-dreadnought battleship===
The term &quot;battleship&quot; was officially adopted by the Royal Navy in the re-classification of 1892. By the 1890s, there was an increasing similarity between battleship designs, and the type that later became known as the &#x27;pre-dreadnought battleship&#x27; emerged. These were heavily armored ships, mounting a mixed battery of guns in turrets, and without sails. The typical first-class battleship of the pre-dreadnought era displaced 15,000 to 17,000 tons, had a speed of , and an armament of four guns in two turrets fore and aft with a mixed-caliber secondary battery amidships around the superstructure. An early design with superficial similarity to the pre-dreadnought is the British of 1871.

The slow-firing 12-inch main guns were the principal weapons for battleship-to-battleship combat. The intermediate and secondary batteries had two roles. Against major ships, it was thought a &#x27;hail of fire&#x27; from quick-firing secondary weapons could distract enemy gun crews by inflicting damage to the superstructure, and they would be more effective against smaller ships such as cruisers. Smaller guns (12-pounders and smaller) were reserved for protecting the battleship against the threat of torpedo attack from destroyers and torpedo boats.

The beginning of the pre-dreadnought era coincided with Britain reasserting her naval dominance. For many years previously, Britain had taken naval supremacy for granted. Expensive naval projects were criticized by political leaders of all inclinations. However, in 1888 a war scare with France and the build-up of the Russian navy gave added impetus to naval construction, and the British Naval Defence Act of 1889 laid down a new fleet including eight new battleships. The principle that Britain&#x27;s navy should be more powerful than the two next most powerful fleets combined was established. This policy was designed to deter France and Russia from building more battleships, but both nations nevertheless expanded their fleets with more and better pre-dreadnoughts in the 1890s.

In the last years of the 19th century and the first years of the 20th, the escalation in the building of battleships became an arms race between Britain and Germany. The German naval laws of 1890 and 1898 authorized a fleet of 38 battleships, a vital threat to the balance of naval power. Britain answered with further shipbuilding, but by the end of the pre-dreadnought era, British supremacy at sea had markedly weakened. In 1883, the United Kingdom had 38 battleships, twice as many as France and almost as many as the rest of the world put together. In 1897, Britain&#x27;s lead was far smaller due to competition from France, Germany, and Russia, as well as the development of pre-dreadnought fleets in Italy, the United States and Japan. The Ottoman Empire, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Chile, and Brazil all had second-rate fleets led by armored cruisers, coastal defence ships or monitors.

Pre-dreadnoughts continued the technical innovations of the ironclad. Turrets, armor plate, and steam engines were all improved over the years, and torpedo tubes were also introduced. A small number of designs, including the American and es, experimented with all or part of the 8-inch intermediate battery superimposed over the 12-inch primary. Results were poor: recoil factors and blast effects resulted in the 8-inch battery being completely unusable, and the inability to train the primary and intermediate armaments on different targets led to significant tactical limitations. Even though such innovative designs saved weight (a key reason for their inception), they proved too cumbersome in practice.

===Dreadnought era===
In 1906, the British Royal Navy launched the revolutionary . Created as a result of pressure from Admiral Sir John (&quot;Jackie&quot;) Fisher, HMS &quot;Dreadnought&quot; rendered existing battleships obsolete. Combining an &quot;all-big-gun&quot; armament of ten 12-inch (305 mm) guns with unprecedented speed (from steam turbine engines) and protection, she prompted navies worldwide to re-evaluate their battleship building programs. While the Japanese had laid down an all-big-gun battleship, , in 1904 and the concept of an all-big-gun ship had been in circulation for several years, it had yet to be validated in combat. &quot;Dreadnought&quot; sparked a new arms race, principally between Britain and Germany but reflected worldwide, as the new class of warships became a crucial element of national power.

Technical development continued rapidly through the dreadnought era, with steep changes in armament, armor and propulsion. Ten years after &quot;Dreadnought&quot;″s commissioning, much more powerful ships, the super-dreadnoughts, were being built.

====Origin====
In the first years of the 20th century, several navies worldwide experimented with the idea of a new type of battleship with a uniform armament of very heavy guns.

Admiral Vittorio Cuniberti, the Italian Navy&#x27;s chief naval architect, articulated the concept of an all-big-gun battleship in 1903. When the &quot;Regia Marina&quot; did not pursue his ideas, Cuniberti wrote an article in &quot;Jane″s&quot; proposing an &quot;ideal&quot; future British battleship, a large armored warship of 17,000 tons, armed solely with a single calibre main battery (twelve 12-inch guns), carrying belt armor, and capable of 24 knots (44 km/h).

The Russo-Japanese War provided operational experience to validate the &quot;all-big-gun&quot; concept. During the Battle of the Yellow Sea on August 10, 1904, Admiral Togo of the Imperial Japanese Navy commenced deliberate 12-inch gun fire at the Russian flagship &quot;Tzesarevich&quot; at . At the Battle of Tsushima on May 27, 1905, Russian Admiral Rozhestvensky&#x27;s flagship fired the first 12-inch guns at the Japanese flagship &quot;Mikasa&quot; at . It is often held that these engagements demonstrated the importance of the 12-inch gun over its smaller counterparts, though some historians take the view that secondary batteries were just as important as the larger weapons when dealing with smaller fast-moving torpedo craft. Such was the case, albeit unsuccessfully, when the at Tsushima had been sent to the bottom by destroyer-launched torpedoes. The 1903–04 design also retained traditional triple-expansion steam engines.

As early as 1904, Jackie Fisher had been convinced of the need for fast, powerful ships with an all-big-gun armament. If Tsushima influenced his thinking, it was to persuade him of the need to standardise on 12-inch guns. Fisher&#x27;s concerns were submarines and destroyers equipped with torpedoes, then threatening to outrange battleship guns, making speed imperative for capital ships. Fisher&#x27;s preferred option was his brainchild, the battlecruiser: lightly armored but heavily armed with eight 12-inch guns and propelled to by steam turbines.

It was to prove this revolutionary technology that &quot;Dreadnought&quot; was designed in January 1905, laid down in October 1905 and sped to completion by 1906. She carried ten 12-inch guns, had an armor belt, and was the first large ship powered by turbines. She mounted her guns in five turrets; three on the centerline (one forward, two aft) and two on the wings, giving her at her launch twice the broadside of any other warship. She retained a number of 12-pound (3-inch or 76 mm) quick-firing guns for use against destroyers and torpedo-boats. Her armor was heavy enough for her to go head-to-head with any other ship in a gun battle, and conceivably win.

&quot;Dreadnought&quot; was to have been followed by three s, their construction delayed to allow lessons from &quot;Dreadnought&quot; to be used in their design. While Fisher may have intended &quot;Dreadnought&quot; to be the last Royal Navy battleship, the design was so successful he found little support for his plan to switch to a battlecruiser navy. Although there were some problems with the ship (the wing turrets had limited arcs of fire and strained the hull when firing a full broadside, and the top of the thickest armor belt lay below the waterline at full load), the Royal Navy promptly commissioned another six ships to a similar design in the and es.

An American design, , authorized in 1905 and laid down in December 1906, was another of the first dreadnoughts, but she and her sister, , were not launched until 1908. Both used triple-expansion engines and had a superior layout of the main battery, dispensing with &quot;Dreadnought&quot;″s wing turrets. They thus retained the same broadside, despite having two fewer guns.

====Arms race====
In 1897, before the revolution in design brought about by HMS &quot;Dreadnought&quot;, the Royal Navy had 62 battleships in commission or building, a lead of 26 over France and 50 over Germany. From the 1906 launching of &quot;Dreadnought&quot;, an arms race with major strategic consequences was prompted. Major naval powers raced to build their own dreadnoughts. Possession of modern battleships was not only seen as vital to naval power, but also, as with nuclear weapons after World War II, represented a nation&#x27;s standing in the world. Germany, France, Japan, Italy, Austria-Hungary, and the United States all began dreadnought programmes; while the Ottoman Empire, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile commissioned dreadnoughts to be built in British and American yards.

===World War I===

By virtue of geography, the Royal Navy was able to use her imposing battleship and battlecruiser fleet to impose a strict and successful naval blockade of Germany and kept Germany&#x27;s smaller battleship fleet bottled up in the North Sea: only narrow channels led to the Atlantic Ocean and these were guarded by British forces. Both sides were aware that, because of the greater number of British dreadnoughts, a full fleet engagement would be likely to result in a British victory. The German strategy was therefore to try to provoke an engagement on their terms: either to induce a part of the Grand Fleet to enter battle alone, or to fight a pitched battle near the German coastline, where friendly minefields, torpedo-boats and submarines could be used to even the odds. This did not happen, however, due in large part to the necessity to keep submarines for the Atlantic campaign. Submarines were the only vessels in the Imperial German Navy able to break out and raid British commerce in force, but even though they sank many merchant ships, they could not successfully counter-blockade the United Kingdom; the Royal Navy successfully adopted convoy tactics to combat Germany&#x27;s submarine counter-blockade and eventually defeated it. This was in stark contrast to Britain&#x27;s successful blockade of Germany.

The first two years of war saw the Royal Navy&#x27;s battleships and battlecruisers regularly &quot;sweep&quot; the North Sea making sure that no German ships could get in or out. Only a few German surface ships that were already at sea, such as the famous light cruiser , were able to raid commerce. Even some of those that did manage to get out were hunted down by battlecruisers, as in the Battle of the Falklands, December 7, 1914. The results of sweeping actions in the North Sea were battles including the Heligoland Bight and Dogger Bank and German raids on the English coast, all of which were attempts by the Germans to lure out portions of the Grand Fleet in an attempt to defeat the Royal Navy in detail. On May 31, 1916, a further attempt to draw British ships into battle on German terms resulted in a clash of the battlefleets in the Battle of Jutland. The German fleet withdrew to port after two short encounters with the British fleet. Less than two months later, the Germans once again attempted to draw portions of the Grand Fleet into battle. The resulting Action of 19 August 1916 proved inconclusive. This reinforced German determination not to engage in a fleet to fleet battle.

In the other naval theatres there were no decisive pitched battles. In the Black Sea, engagement between Russian and Ottoman battleships was restricted to skirmishes. In the Baltic Sea, action was largely limited to the raiding of convoys, and the laying of defensive minefields; the only significant clash of battleship squadrons there was the Battle of Moon Sound at which one Russian pre-dreadnought was lost. The Adriatic was in a sense the mirror of the North Sea: the Austro-Hungarian dreadnought fleet remained bottled up by the British and French blockade. And in the Mediterranean, the most important use of battleships was in support of the amphibious assault on Gallipoli.

In September 1914, the threat posed to surface ships by German U-boats was confirmed by successful attacks on British cruisers, including the sinking of three British armored cruisers by the German submarine in less than an hour. The British Super-dreadnought soon followed suit as she struck a mine laid by a German U-boat in October 1914 and sank. The threat that German U-boats posed to British dreadnoughts was enough to cause the Royal Navy to change their strategy and tactics in the North Sea to reduce the risk of U-boat attack. Further near-misses from submarine attacks on battleships and casualties amongst cruisers led to growing concern in the Royal Navy about the vulnerability of battleships.

As the war wore on however, it turned out that whilst submarines did prove to be a very dangerous threat to older pre-dreadnought battleships, as shown by examples such as the sinking of , which was caught in the Dardanelles by a British submarine and and were torpedoed by &quot;U-21&quot; as well as , , etc., the threat posed to dreadnought battleships proved to have been largely a false alarm. HMS &quot;Audacious&quot; turned out to be the only dreadnought sunk by a submarine in World War I. While battleships were never intended for anti-submarine warfare, there was one instance of a submarine being sunk by a dreadnought battleship. HMS &quot;Dreadnought&quot; rammed and sank the German submarine &quot;U-29&quot; on March 18, 1915, off the Moray Firth.
Whilst the escape of the German fleet from the superior British firepower at Jutland was effected by the German cruisers and destroyers successfully turning away the British battleships, the German attempt to rely on U-boat attacks on the British fleet failed.

Torpedo boats did have some successes against battleships in World War I, as demonstrated by the sinking of the British pre-dreadnought by during the Dardanelles Campaign and the destruction of the Austro-Hungarian dreadnought by Italian motor torpedo boats in June 1918. In large fleet actions, however, destroyers and torpedo boats were usually unable to get close enough to the battleships to damage them. The only battleship sunk in a fleet action by either torpedo boats or destroyers was the obsolescent German pre-dreadnought . She was sunk by destroyers during the night phase of the Battle of Jutland.

The German High Seas Fleet, for their part, were determined not to engage the British without the assistance of submarines; and since the submarines were needed more for raiding commercial traffic, the fleet stayed in port for much of the war.

===Inter-war period===
For many years, Germany simply had no battleships. The Armistice with Germany required that most of the High Seas Fleet be disarmed and interned in a neutral port; largely because no neutral port could be found, the ships remained in British custody in Scapa Flow, Scotland. The Treaty of Versailles specified that the ships should be handed over to the British. Instead, most of them were scuttled by their German crews on June 21, 1919, just before the signature of the peace treaty. The treaty also limited the German Navy, and prevented Germany from building or possessing any capital ships.

The inter-war period saw the battleship subjected to strict international limitations to prevent a costly arms race breaking out.

While the victors were not limited by the Treaty of Versailles, many of the major naval powers were crippled after the war. Faced with the prospect of a naval arms race against the United Kingdom and Japan, which would in turn have led to a possible Pacific war, the United States was keen to conclude the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. This treaty limited the number and size of battleships that each major nation could possess, and required Britain to accept parity with the U.S. and to abandon the British alliance with Japan. The Washington treaty was followed by a series of other naval treaties, including the First Geneva Naval Conference (1927), the First London Naval Treaty (1930), the Second Geneva Naval Conference (1932), and finally the Second London Naval Treaty (1936), which all set limits on major warships. These treaties became effectively obsolete on September 1, 1939, at the beginning of World War II, but the ship classifications that had been agreed upon still apply. The treaty limitations meant that fewer new battleships were launched in 1919–1939 than in 1905–1914. The treaties also inhibited development by imposing upper limits on the weights of ships. Designs like the projected British , the first American , and the Japanese —all of which continued the trend to larger ships with bigger guns and thicker armor—never got off the drawing board. Those designs which were commissioned during this period were referred to as treaty battleships.

====Rise of air power====
As early as 1914, the British Admiral Percy Scott predicted that battleships would soon be made irrelevant by aircraft. By the end of World War I, aircraft had successfully adopted the torpedo as a weapon. In 1921 the Italian general and air theorist Giulio Douhet completed a hugely influential treatise on strategic bombing titled &quot;The Command of the Air&quot;, which foresaw the dominance of air power over naval units.

In the 1920s, General Billy Mitchell of the United States Army Air Corps, believing that air forces had rendered navies around the world obsolete, testified in front of Congress that &quot;1,000 bombardment airplanes can be built and operated for about the price of one battleship&quot; and that a squadron of these bombers could sink a battleship, making for more efficient use of government funds. This infuriated the U.S. Navy, but Mitchell was nevertheless allowed to conduct a careful series of bombing tests alongside Navy and Marine bombers. In 1921, he bombed and sank numerous ships, including the &quot;unsinkable&quot; German World War I battleship and the American pre-dreadnought .

Although Mitchell had required &quot;war-time conditions&quot;, the ships sunk were obsolete, stationary, defenseless and had no damage control. The sinking of &quot;Ostfriesland&quot; was accomplished by violating an agreement that would have allowed Navy engineers to examine the effects of various munitions: Mitchell&#x27;s airmen disregarded the rules, and sank the ship within minutes in a coordinated attack. The stunt made headlines, and Mitchell declared, &quot;No surface vessels can exist wherever air forces acting from land bases are able to attack them.&quot; While far from conclusive, Mitchell&#x27;s test was significant because it put proponents of the battleship against naval aviation on the defensive. Rear Admiral William A. Moffett used public relations against Mitchell to make headway toward expansion of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s nascent aircraft carrier program.

====Rearmament====
The Royal Navy, United States Navy, and Imperial Japanese Navy extensively upgraded and modernized their World War I–era battleships during the 1930s. Among the new features were an increased tower height and stability for the optical rangefinder equipment (for gunnery control), more armor (especially around turrets) to protect against plunging fire and aerial bombing, and additional anti-aircraft weapons. Some British ships received a large block superstructure nicknamed the &quot;Queen Anne&#x27;s castle&quot;, such as in and , which would be used in the new conning towers of the fast battleships. External bulges were added to improve both buoyancy to counteract weight increase and provide underwater protection against mines and torpedoes. The Japanese rebuilt all of their battleships, plus their battlecruisers, with distinctive &quot;pagoda&quot; structures, though the received a more modern bridge tower that would influence the new . Bulges were fitted, including steel tube arrays to improve both underwater and vertical protection along the waterline. The U.S. experimented with cage masts and later tripod masts, though after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor some of the most severely damaged ships (such as and ) were rebuilt with tower masts, for an appearance similar to their contemporaries. Radar, which was effective beyond visual range and effective in complete darkness or adverse weather, was introduced to supplement optical fire control.

Even when war threatened again in the late 1930s, battleship construction did not regain the level of importance it had held in the years before World War I. The &quot;building holiday&quot; imposed by the naval treaties meant the capacity of dockyards worldwide had shrunk, and the strategic position had changed.

In Germany, the ambitious Plan Z for naval rearmament was abandoned in favor of a strategy of submarine warfare supplemented by the use of battlecruisers and commerce raiding (in particular by s). In Britain, the most pressing need was for air defenses and convoy escorts to safeguard the civilian population from bombing or starvation, and re-armament construction plans consisted of five ships of the &quot;King George V&quot; class. It was in the Mediterranean that navies remained most committed to battleship warfare. France intended to build six battleships of the and es, and the Italians four ships. Neither navy built significant aircraft carriers. The U.S. preferred to spend limited funds on aircraft carriers until the . Japan, also prioritising aircraft carriers, nevertheless began work on three mammoth &quot;Yamato&quot;s (although the third, , was later completed as a carrier) and a planned fourth was cancelled.

At the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, the Spanish navy included only two small dreadnought battleships, and . &quot;España&quot; (originally named &quot;Alfonso XIII&quot;), by then in reserve at the northwestern naval base of El Ferrol, fell into Nationalist hands in July 1936. The crew aboard &quot;Jaime I&quot; remained loyal to the Republic, killed their officers, who apparently supported Franco&#x27;s attempted coup, and joined the Republican Navy. Thus each side had one battleship; however, the Republican Navy generally lacked experienced officers. The Spanish battleships mainly restricted themselves to mutual blockades, convoy escort duties, and shore bombardment, rarely in direct fighting against other surface units. In April 1937, &quot;España&quot; ran into a mine laid by friendly forces, and sank with little loss of life. In May 1937, &quot;Jaime I&quot; was damaged by Nationalist air attacks and a grounding incident. The ship was forced to go back to port to be repaired. There she was again hit by several aerial bombs. It was then decided to tow the battleship to a more secure port, but during the transport she suffered an internal explosion that caused 300 deaths and her total loss. Several Italian and German capital ships participated in the non-intervention blockade. On May 29, 1937, two Republican aircraft managed to bomb the German pocket battleship outside Ibiza, causing severe damage and loss of life. retaliated two days later by bombarding Almería, causing much destruction, and the resulting &quot;Deutschland&quot; incident meant the end of German and Italian participation in non-intervention.

===World War II===

The —an obsolete pre-dreadnought—fired the first shots of World War II with the bombardment of the Polish garrison at Westerplatte; and the final surrender of the Japanese Empire took place aboard a United States Navy battleship, . Between those two events, it had become clear that aircraft carriers were the new principal ships of the fleet and that battleships now performed a secondary role.

Battleships played a part in major engagements in Atlantic, Pacific and Mediterranean theaters; in the Atlantic, the Germans used their battleships as independent commerce raiders. However, clashes between battleships were of little strategic importance. The Battle of the Atlantic was fought between destroyers and submarines, and most of the decisive fleet clashes of the Pacific war were determined by aircraft carriers.

In the first year of the war, armored warships defied predictions that aircraft would dominate naval warfare. and surprised and sank the aircraft carrier off western Norway in June 1940. This engagement marked the only time a fleet carrier was sunk by surface gunnery. In the attack on Mers-el-Kébir, British battleships opened fire on the French battleships in the harbor near Oran in Algeria with their heavy guns. The fleeing French ships were then pursued by planes from aircraft carriers.

The subsequent years of the war saw many demonstrations of the maturity of the aircraft carrier as a strategic naval weapon and its effectiveness against battleships. The British air attack on the Italian naval base at Taranto sank one Italian battleship and damaged two more. The same Swordfish torpedo bombers played a crucial role in sinking the German battleship .

On December 7, 1941, the Japanese launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. Within a short time, five of eight U.S. battleships were sunk or sinking, with the rest damaged. All three American aircraft carriers were out to sea, however, and evaded destruction. The sinking of the British battleship and battlecruiser , demonstrated the vulnerability of a battleship to air attack while at sea without sufficient air cover, settling the argument begun by Mitchell in 1921. Both warships were under way and en route to attack the Japanese amphibious force that had invaded Malaya when they were caught by Japanese land-based bombers and torpedo bombers on December 10, 1941.

At many of the early crucial battles of the Pacific, for instance Coral Sea and Midway, battleships were either absent or overshadowed as carriers launched wave after wave of planes into the attack at a range of hundreds of miles. In later battles in the Pacific, battleships primarily performed shore bombardment in support of amphibious landings and provided anti-aircraft defense as escort for the carriers. Even the largest battleships ever constructed, Japan&#x27;s &quot;Yamato&quot; class, which carried a main battery of nine guns and were designed as a principal strategic weapon, were never given a chance to show their potential in the decisive battleship action that figured in Japanese pre-war planning.

The last battleship confrontation in history was the Battle of Surigao Strait, on October 25, 1944, in which a numerically and technically superior American battleship group destroyed a lesser Japanese battleship group by gunfire after it had already been devastated by destroyer torpedo attacks. All but one of the American battleships in this confrontation had previously been sunk during the attack on Pearl Harbor and subsequently raised and repaired. fired the last major-caliber salvo of this battle. In April 1945, during the battle for Okinawa, the world&#x27;s most powerful battleship, the &quot;Yamato&quot;, was sent out on a suicide mission against a massive U.S. force and sunk by overwhelming pressure from carrier aircraft with nearly all hands lost. After that, the Japanese fleet remaining in the home islands was also destroyed by the US naval air force.

===Cold War===
After World War II, several navies retained their existing battleships, but they were no longer strategically dominant military assets. It soon became apparent that they were no longer worth the considerable cost of construction and maintenance and only one new battleship was commissioned after the war, . During the war it had been demonstrated that battleship-on-battleship engagements like Leyte Gulf or the sinking of were the exception and not the rule, and with the growing role of aircraft, engagement ranges were becoming longer and longer, making heavy gun armament irrelevant. The armor of a battleship was equally irrelevant in the face of a nuclear attack as tactical missiles with a range of or more could be mounted on the Soviet and s. By the end of the 1950s, smaller vessel classes such as destroyers, which formerly offered no noteworthy opposition to battleships, now were capable of eliminating battleships from outside the range of the ship&#x27;s heavy guns.

The remaining battleships met a variety of ends. and the were sunk during the testing of nuclear weapons in Operation Crossroads in 1946. Both battleships proved resistant to nuclear air burst but vulnerable to underwater nuclear explosions (in the case of &quot;Arkansas&quot;, &quot;vulnerable&quot; due to her proximity to the bomb crushing, flipping, and sinking her in less than a second). The was taken by the Soviets as reparations and renamed &quot;Novorossiysk&quot;; she was sunk by a leftover German mine in the Black Sea on October 29, 1955. The two ships were scrapped in 1956. The was scrapped in 1954, in 1968, and in 1970.

The United Kingdom&#x27;s four surviving &quot;King George V&quot;-class ships were scrapped in 1957, and &quot;Vanguard&quot; followed in 1960. All other surviving British battleships had been sold or broken up by 1949. The Soviet Union&#x27;s was scrapped in 1953, in 1957 and (back under her original name, &quot;Gangut&quot;, since 1942) in 1956–57. Brazil&#x27;s was scrapped in Genoa in 1953, and her sister ship sank during a storm in the Atlantic &quot;en route&quot; to the breakers in Italy in 1951.

Argentina kept its two ships until 1956 and Chile kept (formerly HMS &quot;Canada&quot;) until 1959. The Turkish battlecruiser (formerly SMs &quot;Goeben&quot;, launched in 1911) was scrapped in 1976 after an offer to sell her back to Germany was refused. Sweden had several small coastal-defense battleships, one of which, , survived until 1970. The Soviets scrapped four large incomplete cruisers in the late 1950s, whilst plans to build a number of new s were abandoned following the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953. The three old German battleships &quot;Schleswig-Holstein&quot;, , and all met similar ends. &quot;Hessen&quot; was taken over by the Soviet Union and renamed &quot;Tsel&quot;. She was scrapped in 1960. &quot;Schleswig-Holstein&quot; was renamed &quot;Borodino&quot;, and was used as a target ship until 1960. &quot;Schlesien&quot;, too, was used as a target ship. She was broken up between 1952 and 1957.
The &quot;Iowa&quot;-class battleships gained a new lease of life in the U.S. Navy as fire support ships. Radar and computer-controlled gunfire could be aimed with pinpoint accuracy to target. The U.S. recommissioned all four &quot;Iowa&quot;-class battleships for the Korean War and the for the Vietnam War. These were primarily used for shore bombardment, &quot;New Jersey&quot; firing nearly 6,000 rounds of 16-inch shells and over 14,000 rounds of 5-inch projectiles during her tour on the gunline, seven times more rounds against shore targets in Vietnam than she had fired in the Second World War.

As part of Navy Secretary John F. Lehman&#x27;s effort to build a 600-ship Navy in the 1980s, and in response to the commissioning of by the Soviet Union, the United States recommissioned all four &quot;Iowa&quot;-class battleships. On several occasions, battleships were support ships in carrier battle groups, or led their own battleship battle group. These were modernized to carry Tomahawk (TLAM) missiles, with &quot;New Jersey&quot; seeing action bombarding Lebanon in 1983 and 1984, while &quot;Missouri&quot; and fired their 16-inch (406 mm) guns at land targets and launched missiles during Operation Desert Storm in 1991. &quot;Wisconsin&quot; served as the TLAM strike commander for the Persian Gulf, directing the sequence of launches that marked the opening of &quot;Desert Storm&quot;, firing a total of 24 TLAMs during the first two days of the campaign. The primary threat to the battleships were Iraqi shore-based surface-to-surface missiles; &quot;Missouri&quot; was targeted by two Iraqi Silkworm missiles, with one missing and another being intercepted by the British destroyer .

===End of the battleship era===
After was stricken in 1962, the four &quot;Iowa-class&quot; ships were the only battleships in commission or reserve anywhere in the world. There was an extended debate when the four &quot;Iowa&quot; ships were finally decommissioned in the early 1990s. and &quot;Wisconsin&quot; were maintained to a standard whereby they could be rapidly returned to service as fire support vessels, pending the development of a superior fire support vessel. These last two battleships were finally stricken from the U.S. Naval Vessel Register in 2006. The Military Balance and Russian Foreign Military Review states the U.S. Navy listed one battleship in the reserve (Naval Inactive Fleet/Reserve 2nd Turn) in 2010. The Military Balance states the U.S. Navy listed no battleships in the reserve in 2014.

When the last &quot;Iowa&quot;-class ship was finally stricken from the Naval Vessel Registry, no battleships remained in service or in reserve with any navy worldwide. A number are preserved as museum ships, either afloat or in drydock. The U.S. has eight battleships on display: , , , &quot;Iowa&quot;, &quot;New Jersey&quot;, &quot;Missouri&quot;, &quot;Wisconsin&quot;, and . &quot;Missouri&quot; and &quot;New Jersey&quot; are museums at Pearl Harbor and Camden, New Jersey, respectively. &quot;Iowa&quot; is on display as an educational attraction at the Los Angeles Waterfront in San Pedro, California. &quot;Wisconsin&quot; now serves as a museum ship in Norfolk, Virginia. &quot;Massachusetts&quot;, which has the distinction of never having lost a man during service, is on display at the Battleship Cove naval museum in Fall River, Massachusetts. &quot;Texas&quot;, the first battleship turned into a museum, is normally on display at the San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site, near Houston, but as of 2021 is closed for repairs. &quot;North Carolina&quot; is on display in Wilmington, North Carolina. &quot;Alabama&quot; is on display in Mobile, Alabama. The wreck of , sunk during the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941, is designated a historical landmark and national gravesite. The wreck of , also sunk during the attack, is a historic landmark.

The only other 20th-century battleship on display is the Japanese pre-dreadnought . A replica of the ironclad battleship was built by the Weihai Port Bureau in 2003 and is on display in Weihai, China.

==Strategy and doctrine==
===Doctrine===
Battleships were the embodiment of sea power. For American naval officer Alfred Thayer Mahan and his followers, a strong navy was vital to the success of a nation, and control of the seas was vital for the projection of force on land and overseas. Mahan&#x27;s theory, proposed in &quot;The Influence of Sea Power Upon History, 1660–1783&quot; of 1890, dictated the role of the battleship was to sweep the enemy from the seas. While the work of escorting, blockading, and raiding might be done by cruisers or smaller vessels, the presence of the battleship was a potential threat to any convoy escorted by any vessels other than capital ships. This concept of &quot;potential threat&quot; can be further generalized to the mere existence (as opposed to presence) of a powerful fleet tying the opposing fleet down. This concept came to be known as a &quot;fleet in being&quot;—an idle yet mighty fleet forcing others to spend time, resource and effort to actively guard against it.

Mahan went on to say victory could only be achieved by engagements between battleships, which came to be known as the &quot;decisive battle&quot; doctrine in some navies, while targeting merchant ships (commerce raiding or &quot;guerre de course&quot;, as posited by the &quot;Jeune École&quot;) could never succeed.

Mahan was highly influential in naval and political circles throughout the age of the battleship, calling for a large fleet of the most powerful battleships possible. Mahan&#x27;s work developed in the late 1880s, and by the end of the 1890s it had acquired much international influence on naval strategy; in the end, it was adopted by many major navies (notably the British, American, German, and Japanese). The strength of Mahanian opinion was important in the development of the battleships arms races, and equally important in the agreement of the Powers to limit battleship numbers in the interwar era.

The &quot;fleet in being&quot; suggested battleships could simply by their existence tie down superior enemy resources. This in turn was believed to be able to tip the balance of a conflict even without a battle. This suggested even for inferior naval powers a battleship fleet could have important strategic effect.

===Tactics===
While the role of battleships in both World Wars reflected Mahanian doctrine, the details of battleship deployment were more complex. Unlike ships of the line, the battleships of the late 19th and early 20th centuries had significant vulnerability to torpedoes and mines—because efficient mines and torpedoes did not exist before that—which could be used by relatively small and inexpensive craft. The &quot;Jeune École&quot; doctrine of the 1870s and 1880s recommended placing torpedo boats alongside battleships; these would hide behind the larger ships until gun-smoke obscured visibility enough for them to dart out and fire their torpedoes. While this tactic was made less effective by the development of smokeless propellant, the threat from more capable torpedo craft (later including submarines) remained. By the 1890s, the Royal Navy had developed the first destroyers, which were initially designed to intercept and drive off any attacking torpedo boats. During the First World War and subsequently, battleships were rarely deployed without a protective screen of destroyers.

Battleship doctrine emphasized the concentration of the battlegroup. In order for this concentrated force to be able to bring its power to bear on a reluctant opponent (or to avoid an encounter with a stronger enemy fleet), battlefleets needed some means of locating enemy ships beyond horizon range. This was provided by scouting forces; at various stages battlecruisers, cruisers, destroyers, airships, submarines and aircraft were all used. (With the development of radio, direction finding and traffic analysis would come into play, as well, so even shore stations, broadly speaking, joined the battlegroup.) So for most of their history, battleships operated surrounded by squadrons of destroyers and cruisers. The North Sea campaign of the First World War illustrates how, despite this support, the threat of mine and torpedo attack, and the failure to integrate or appreciate the capabilities of new techniques, seriously inhibited the operations of the Royal Navy Grand Fleet, the greatest battleship fleet of its time.

===Strategic and diplomatic impact===
The presence of battleships had a great psychological and diplomatic impact. Similar to possessing nuclear weapons today, the ownership of battleships served to enhance a nation&#x27;s force projection.

Even during the Cold War, the psychological impact of a battleship was significant. In 1946, USS &quot;Missouri&quot; was dispatched to deliver the remains of the ambassador from Turkey, and her presence in Turkish and Greek waters staved off a possible Soviet thrust into the Balkan region. In September 1983, when Druze militia in Lebanon&#x27;s Shouf Mountains fired upon U.S. Marine peacekeepers, the arrival of USS &quot;New Jersey&quot; stopped the firing. Gunfire from &quot;New Jersey&quot; later killed militia leaders.

===Value for money===
Battleships were the largest and most complex, and hence the most expensive warships of their time; as a result, the value of investment in battleships has always been contested. As the French politician Etienne Lamy wrote in 1879, &quot;The construction of battleships is so costly, their effectiveness so uncertain and of such short duration, that the enterprise of creating an armored fleet seems to leave fruitless the perseverance of a people&quot;. The &quot;Jeune École&quot; school of thought of the 1870s and 1880s sought alternatives to the crippling expense and debatable utility of a conventional battlefleet. It proposed what would nowadays be termed a sea denial strategy, based on fast, long-ranged cruisers for commerce raiding and torpedo boat flotillas to attack enemy ships attempting to blockade French ports. The ideas of the &quot;Jeune École&quot; were ahead of their time; it was not until the 20th century that efficient mines, torpedoes, submarines, and aircraft were available that allowed similar ideas to be effectively implemented. The determination of powers such as Germany to build battlefleets with which to confront much stronger rivals has been criticized by historians, who emphasise the futility of investment in a battlefleet that has no chance of matching its opponent in an actual battle.

<doc id="4055" wikidata="Q208525" url="?curid=4055" title="Bifröst">
<text>In Norse mythology, Bifröst (), also called Bilröst, is a burning rainbow bridge that reaches between Midgard (Earth) and Asgard, the realm of the gods. The bridge is attested as &quot;Bilröst&quot; in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; as &quot;Bifröst&quot; in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; and in the poetry of skalds. Both the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; and the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; alternately refer to the bridge as Ásbrú (Old Norse &quot;Æsir&#x27;s bridge&quot;).

According to the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, the bridge ends in heaven at Himinbjörg, the residence of the god Heimdall, who guards it from the jötnar. The bridge&#x27;s destruction during Ragnarök by the forces of Muspell is foretold. Scholars have proposed that the bridge may have originally represented the Milky Way and have noted parallels between the bridge and another bridge in Norse mythology, Gjallarbrú.

== Etymology ==

Scholar Andy Orchard suggests that &quot;Bifröst&quot; may mean &quot;shimmering path.&quot; He notes that the first element of &quot;Bilröst&quot;—&quot;bil&quot; (meaning &quot;a moment&quot;)—&quot;suggests the fleeting nature of the rainbow,&quot; which he connects to the first element of &quot;Bifröst&quot;—the Old Norse verb &quot;bifa&quot; (meaning &quot;to shimmer&quot; or &quot;to shake&quot;)—noting that the element evokes notions of the &quot;lustrous sheen&quot; of the bridge. Austrian Germanist Rudolf Simek says that &quot;Bifröst&quot; either means &quot;the swaying road to heaven&quot; (also citing &quot;bifa&quot;) or, if &quot;Bilröst&quot; is the original form of the two (which Simek says is likely), &quot;the fleetingly glimpsed rainbow&quot; (possibly connected to &quot;bil&quot;, perhaps meaning &quot;moment, weak point&quot;).

== Attestations ==

Two poems in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; and two books in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; provide information about the bridge:

=== &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; ===

In the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, the bridge is mentioned in the poems &quot;Grímnismál&quot; and &quot;Fáfnismál&quot;, where it is referred to as &quot;Bilröst&quot;. In one of two stanzas in the poem &quot;Grímnismál&quot; that mentions the bridge, Grímnir (the god Odin in disguise) provides the young Agnarr with cosmological knowledge, including that Bilröst is the best of bridges. Later in &quot;Grímnismál&quot;, Grímnir notes that Asbrú &quot;burns all with flames&quot; and that, every day, the god Thor wades through the waters of Körmt and Örmt and the two Kerlaugar:

In &quot;Fáfnismál&quot;, the dying wyrm Fafnir tells the hero Sigurd that, during the events of Ragnarök, bearing spears, gods will meet at Óskópnir. From there, the gods will cross Bilröst, which will break apart as they cross over it, causing their horses to dredge through an immense river.

===&quot;Prose Edda&quot;===

The bridge is mentioned in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; books &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; and &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, where it is referred to as &quot;Bifröst&quot;. In chapter 13 of &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, Gangleri (King Gylfi in disguise) asks the enthroned figure of High what way exists between heaven and earth. Laughing, High replies that the question isn&#x27;t an intelligent one, and goes on to explain that the gods built a bridge from heaven and earth. He incredulously asks Gangleri if he has not heard the story before. High says that Gangleri must have seen it, and notes that Gangleri may call it a rainbow. High says that the bridge consists of three colors, has great strength, &quot;and is built with art and skill to a greater extent than other constructions.&quot;

High notes that, although the bridge is strong, it will break when &quot;Muspell&#x27;s lads&quot; attempt to cross it, and their horses will have to make do with swimming over &quot;great rivers.&quot; Gangleri says that it doesn&#x27;t seem that the gods &quot;built the bridge in good faith if it is liable to break, considering that they can do as they please.&quot; High responds that the gods do not deserve blame for the breaking of the bridge, for &quot;there is nothing in this world that will be secure when Muspell&#x27;s sons attack.&quot;

In chapter 15 of &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, Just-As-High says that Bifröst is also called &quot;Asbrú&quot;, and that every day the gods ride their horses across it (with the exception of Thor, who instead wades through the boiling waters of the rivers Körmt and Örmt) to reach Urðarbrunnr, a holy well where the gods have their court. As a reference, Just-As-High quotes the second of the two stanzas in &quot;Grímnismál&quot; that mention the bridge (see above). Gangleri asks if fire burns over Bifröst. High says that the red in the bridge is burning fire, and, without it, the frost jotnar and mountain jotnar would &quot;go up into heaven&quot; if anyone who wanted could cross Bifröst. High adds that, in heaven, &quot;there are many beautiful places&quot; and that &quot;everywhere there has divine protection around it.&quot;

In chapter 17, High tells Gangleri that the location of Himinbjörg &quot;stands at the edge of heaven where Bifrost reaches heaven.&quot; While describing the god Heimdallr in chapter 27, High says that Heimdallr lives in Himinbjörg by Bifröst, and guards the bridge from mountain jotnar while sitting at the edge of heaven. In chapter 34, High quotes the first of the two &quot;Grímnismál&quot; stanzas that mention the bridge. In chapter 51, High foretells the events of Ragnarök. High says that, during Ragnarök, the sky will split open, and from the split will ride forth the &quot;sons of Muspell&quot;. When the &quot;sons of Muspell&quot; ride over Bifröst it will break, &quot;as was said above.&quot;

In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, the bridge receives a single mention. In chapter 16, a work by the 10th century skald Úlfr Uggason is provided, where Bifröst is referred to as &quot;the powers&#x27; way.&quot;

== Theories ==

In his translation of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, Henry Adams Bellows comments that the &quot;Grímnismál&quot; stanza mentioning Thor and the bridge stanza may mean that &quot;Thor has to go on foot in the last days of the destruction, when the bridge is burning. Another interpretation, however, is that when Thor leaves the heavens (i.e., when a thunder-storm is over) the rainbow-bridge becomes hot in the sun.&quot;

John Lindow points to a parallel between Bifröst, which he notes is &quot;a bridge between earth and heaven, or earth and the world of the gods&quot;, and the bridge Gjallarbrú, &quot;a bridge between earth and the underworld, or earth and the world of the dead.&quot; Several scholars have proposed that Bifröst may represent the Milky Way.

== Adaptations ==

In the final scene of Richard Wagner&#x27;s 1869 opera &quot;Das Rheingold&quot;, the god Froh summons a rainbow bridge, over which the gods cross to enter Valhalla.
In J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s legendarium, the &quot;level bridge&quot; of &quot;The Fall of Númenor&quot;, an early version of the &quot;Akallabeth&quot;, recalls Bifröst. It departs from the earth at a tangent, allowing immortal Elves but not mortal Men to travel the Old Straight Road to the lost earthly paradise of Valinor after the world has been remade. 

Bifröst appears in comic books associated with the Marvel Comics character Thor and in subsequent adaptations of those comic books. In the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Thor&quot;, Jane Foster describes the Bifröst as an Einstein–Rosen bridge, which functions as a means of transportation across space in a short period of time.

<text>The battlecruiser (also written as battle cruiser or battle-cruiser) was a type of capital ship of the first half of the 20th century. These were similar in displacement, armament and cost to battleships, but differed in form and balance of attributes. Battlecruisers typically had thinner armour (to a varying degree) and a somewhat lighter main gun battery than contemporary battleships, installed on a longer hull with much higher engine power in order to attain greater speeds. The first battlecruisers were designed in the United Kingdom, as a development of the armoured cruiser, at the same time as the dreadnought succeeded the pre-dreadnought battleship. The goal of the design was to outrun any ship with similar armament, and chase down any ship with lesser armament; they were intended to hunt down slower, older armoured cruisers and destroy them with heavy gunfire while avoiding combat with the more powerful but slower battleships. However, as more and more battlecruisers were built, they were increasingly used alongside the better-protected battleships.

Battlecruisers served in the navies of the United Kingdom, Germany, the Ottoman Empire, Australia and Japan during World War I, most notably at the Battle of the Falkland Islands and in the several raids and skirmishes in the North Sea which culminated in a pitched fleet battle, the Battle of Jutland. British battlecruisers in particular suffered heavy losses at Jutland, where poor fire safety and ammunition handling practices left them vulnerable to catastrophic magazine explosions following hits to their main turrets from large-calibre shells. This dismal showing led to a persistent general belief that battlecruisers were too thinly armoured to function successfully. By the end of the war, capital ship design had developed, with battleships becoming faster and battlecruisers becoming more heavily armoured, blurring the distinction between a battlecruiser and a fast battleship. The Washington Naval Treaty, which limited capital ship construction from 1922 onwards, treated battleships and battlecruisers identically, and the new generation of battlecruisers planned by the United States, Great Britain and Japan were scrapped or converted into aircraft carriers under the terms of the treaty.

Improvements in armour design and propulsion created the 1930s &quot;fast battleship&quot; with the speed of a battlecruiser and armour of a battleship, making the battlecruiser in the traditional sense effectively an obsolete concept. Thus from the 1930s on, only the Royal Navy continued to use &quot;battlecruiser&quot; as a classification for the World War I–era capital ships that remained in the fleet; while Japan&#x27;s battlecruisers remained in service, they had been significantly reconstructed and were re-rated as full-fledged fast battleships. Some new vessels built during that decade, the German s and s and the French s are all sometimes referred to as battlecruisers, although the owning navies referred to them as &quot;battleships&quot; (), &quot;armoured ships&quot; () and &quot;battleships&quot; () respectively.

Battlecruisers were put into action again during World War II, and only one survived to the end, . There was also renewed interest in large &quot;cruiser-killer&quot; type warships whose design was scaled-up from a heavy cruiser rather than a lighter/faster battleship derivative, but few were ever begun and only two members of the were commissioned in time to see war service. Construction of large cruisers as well as fast battleships were curtailed in favor of more-needed aircraft carriers, convoy escorts, and cargo ships. 

During (and after) the Cold War, the Soviet of large guided missile cruisers have been the only ships termed &quot;battlecruisers&quot;; the class is also the only example of a nuclear-powered battlecruiser. As of 2024, Russia operates two units: the &quot;Pyotr Velikiy&quot; has remained in active service since its 1998 commissioning, while the &quot;Admiral Nakhimov&quot; has been inactive (in storage or refitting) since 1999.

==Background==
The battlecruiser was developed by the Royal Navy in the first years of the 20th century as an evolution of the armoured cruiser. The first armoured cruisers had been built in the 1870s, as an attempt to give armour protection to ships fulfilling the typical cruiser roles of patrol, trade protection and power projection. However, the results were rarely satisfactory, as the weight of armour required for any meaningful protection usually meant that the ship became almost as slow as a battleship. As a result, navies preferred to build protected cruisers with an armoured deck protecting their engines, or simply no armour at all.

In the 1890s, new Krupp steel armour meant that it was now possible to give a cruiser side armour which would protect it against the quick-firing guns of enemy battleships and cruisers alike. In 1896–97 France and Russia, who were regarded as likely allies in the event of war, started to build large, fast armoured cruisers taking advantage of this. In the event of a war between Britain and France or Russia, or both, these cruisers threatened to cause serious difficulties for the British Empire&#x27;s worldwide trade.

Britain, which had concluded in 1892 that it needed twice as many cruisers as any potential enemy to adequately protect its empire&#x27;s sea lanes, responded to the perceived threat by laying down its own large armoured cruisers. Between 1899 and 1905, it completed or laid down seven classes of this type, a total of 35 ships. This building program, in turn, prompted the French and Russians to increase their own construction. The Imperial German Navy began to build large armoured cruisers for use on their overseas stations, laying down eight between 1897 and 1906. In the period 1889–1896, the Royal Navy spent £7.3 million on new large cruisers. From 1897 to 1904, it spent £26.9 million. Many armoured cruisers of the new kind were just as large and expensive as the equivalent battleship.

The increasing size and power of the armoured cruiser led to suggestions in British naval circles that cruisers should displace battleships entirely. The battleship&#x27;s main advantage was its 12-inch heavy guns, and heavier armour designed to protect from shells of similar size. However, for a few years after 1900 it seemed that those advantages were of little practical value. The torpedo now had a range of 2,000 yards, and it seemed unlikely that a battleship would engage within torpedo range. However, at ranges of more than 2,000 yards it became increasingly unlikely that the heavy guns of a battleship would score any hits, as the heavy guns relied on primitive aiming techniques. The secondary batteries of 6-inch quick-firing guns, firing more plentiful shells, were more likely to hit the enemy. As naval expert Fred T. Jane wrote in June 1902,Is there anything outside of 2,000 yards that the big gun in its hundreds of tons of medieval castle can affect, that its weight in 6-inch guns without the castle could not affect equally well? And inside 2,000, what, in these days of gyros, is there that the torpedo cannot effect with far more certainty?

In 1904, Admiral John &quot;Jacky&quot; Fisher became First Sea Lord, the senior officer of the Royal Navy. He had for some time thought about the development of a new fast armoured ship. He was very fond of the &quot;second-class battleship&quot; , a faster, more lightly armoured battleship. As early as 1901, there is confusion in Fisher&#x27;s writing about whether he saw the battleship or the cruiser as the model for future developments. This did not stop him from commissioning designs from naval architect W. H. Gard for an armoured cruiser with the heaviest possible armament for use with the fleet. The design Gard submitted was for a ship between , capable of , armed with four 9.2-inch and twelve guns in twin gun turrets and protected with six inches of armour along her belt and 9.2-inch turrets, on her 7.5-inch turrets, 10 inches on her conning tower and up to on her decks. However, mainstream British naval thinking between 1902 and 1904 was clearly in favour of heavily armoured battleships, rather than the fast ships that Fisher favoured.

The Battle of Tsushima proved the effectiveness of heavy guns over intermediate ones and the need for a uniform main caliber on a ship for fire control. Even before this, the Royal Navy had begun to consider a shift away from the mixed-calibre armament of the 1890s pre-dreadnought to an &quot;all-big-gun&quot; design, and preliminary designs circulated for battleships with all 12-inch or all 10-inch guns and armoured cruisers with all 9.2-inch guns. In late 1904, not long after the Royal Navy had decided to use 12-inch guns for its next generation of battleships because of their superior performance at long range, Fisher began to argue that big-gun cruisers could replace battleships altogether. The continuing improvement of the torpedo meant that submarines and destroyers would be able to destroy battleships; this in Fisher&#x27;s view heralded the end of the battleship or at least compromised the validity of heavy armour protection. Nevertheless, armoured cruisers would remain vital for commerce protection.

Fisher&#x27;s views were very controversial within the Royal Navy, and even given his position as First Sea Lord, he was not in a position to insist on his own approach. Thus he assembled a &quot;Committee on Designs&quot;, consisting of a mixture of civilian and naval experts, to determine the approach to both battleship and armoured cruiser construction in the future. While the stated purpose of the committee was to investigate and report on future requirements of ships, Fisher and his associates had already made key decisions. The terms of reference for the committee were for a battleship capable of with 12-inch guns and no intermediate calibres, capable of docking in existing drydocks; and a cruiser capable of , also with 12-inch guns and no intermediate armament, armoured like , the most recent armoured cruiser, and also capable of using existing docks.

==First battlecruisers==
Under the Selborne plan of 1902, the Royal Navy intended to start three new battleships and four armoured cruisers each year. However, in late 1904 it became clear that the 1905–1906 programme would have to be considerably smaller, because of lower than expected tax revenue and the need to buy out two Chilean battleships under construction in British yards, lest they be purchased by the Russians for use against the Japanese, Britain&#x27;s ally. These economic realities meant that the 1905–1906 programme consisted only of one battleship, but three armoured cruisers. The battleship became the revolutionary battleship , and the cruisers became the three ships of the . Fisher later claimed, however, that he had argued during the committee for the cancellation of the remaining battleship.

The construction of the new class was begun in 1906 and completed in 1908, delayed perhaps to allow their designers to learn from any problems with &quot;Dreadnought&quot;. The ships fulfilled the design requirement quite closely. On a displacement similar to &quot;Dreadnought&quot;, the &quot;Invincible&quot;s were longer to accommodate additional boilers and more powerful turbines to propel them at . Moreover, the new ships could maintain this speed for days, whereas pre-dreadnought battleships could not generally do so for more than an hour. Armed with eight 12-inch Mk X guns, compared to ten on &quot;Dreadnought&quot;, they had of armour protecting the hull and the gun turrets. (&quot;Dreadnought&quot;″s armour, by comparison, was at its thickest.) The class had a very marked increase in speed, displacement and firepower compared to the most recent armoured cruisers but no more armour.

While the &quot;Invincible&quot;s were to fill the same role as the armoured cruisers they succeeded, they were expected to do so more effectively. Specifically their roles were:
* Heavy reconnaissance. Because of their power, the &quot;Invincible&quot;s could sweep away the screen of enemy cruisers to close with and observe an enemy battlefleet before using their superior speed to retire.
* Close support for the battle fleet. They could be stationed at the ends of the battle line to stop enemy cruisers harassing the battleships, and to harass the enemy&#x27;s battleships if they were busy fighting battleships. Also, the &quot;Invincible&quot;s could operate as the fast wing of the battlefleet and try to outmanoeuvre the enemy.
* Pursuit. If an enemy fleet ran, then the &quot;Invincible&quot;s would use their speed to pursue, and their guns to damage or slow enemy ships.
* Commerce protection. The new ships would hunt down enemy cruisers and commerce raiders.
Confusion about how to refer to these new battleship-size armoured cruisers set in almost immediately. Even in late 1905, before work was begun on the &quot;Invincible&quot;s, a Royal Navy memorandum refers to &quot;large armoured ships&quot; meaning both battleships and large cruisers. In October 1906, the Admiralty began to classify all post-Dreadnought battleships and armoured cruisers as &quot;capital ships&quot;, while Fisher used the term &quot;dreadnought&quot; to refer either to his new battleships or the battleships and armoured cruisers together. At the same time, the &quot;Invincible&quot; class themselves were referred to as &quot;cruiser-battleships&quot;, &quot;dreadnought cruisers&quot;; the term &quot;battlecruiser&quot; was first used by Fisher in 1908. Finally, on 24 November 1911, Admiralty Weekly Order No. 351 laid down that &quot;All cruisers of the &quot;Invincible&quot; and later types are for the future to be described and classified as &quot;battle cruisers&quot; to distinguish them from the armoured cruisers of earlier date.&quot;

Along with questions over the new ships&#x27; nomenclature came uncertainty about their actual role due to their lack of protection. If they were primarily to act as scouts for the battle fleet and hunter-killers of enemy cruisers and commerce raiders, then the seven inches of belt armour with which they had been equipped would be adequate. If, on the other hand, they were expected to reinforce a battle line of dreadnoughts with their own heavy guns, they were too thin-skinned to be safe from an enemy&#x27;s heavy guns. The &quot;Invincible&quot;s were essentially extremely large, heavily armed, fast armoured cruisers. However, the viability of the armoured cruiser was already in doubt. A cruiser that could have worked with the Fleet might have been a more viable option for taking over that role.

Because of the &quot;Invincible&quot;s″ size and armament, naval authorities considered them capital ships almost from their inception—an assumption that might have been inevitable. Complicating matters further was that many naval authorities, including Lord Fisher, had made overoptimistic assessments from the Battle of Tsushima in 1905 about the armoured cruiser&#x27;s ability to survive in a battle line against enemy capital ships due to their superior speed. These assumptions had been made without taking into account the Russian Baltic Fleet&#x27;s inefficiency and tactical ineptitude. By the time the term &quot;battlecruiser&quot; had been given to the &quot;Invincible&quot;s, the idea of their parity with battleships had been fixed in many people&#x27;s minds.

Not everyone was so convinced. &quot;Brassey″s Naval Annual&quot;, for instance, stated that with vessels as large and expensive as the &quot;Invincible&quot;s, an admiral &quot;will be certain to put them in the line of battle where their comparatively light protection will be a disadvantage and their high speed of no value.&quot; Those in favor of the battlecruiser countered with two points—first, since all capital ships were vulnerable to new weapons such as the torpedo, armour had lost some of its validity; and second, because of its greater speed, the battlecruiser could control the range at which it engaged an enemy.

==Battlecruisers in the dreadnought arms race==
Between the launching of the &quot;Invincible&quot;s to just after the outbreak of the First World War, the battlecruiser played a junior role in the developing dreadnought arms race, as it was never wholeheartedly adopted as the key weapon in British imperial defence, as Fisher had presumably desired. The biggest factor for this lack of acceptance was the marked change in Britain&#x27;s strategic circumstances between their conception and the commissioning of the first ships. The prospective enemy for Britain had shifted from a Franco-Russian alliance with many armoured cruisers to a resurgent and increasingly belligerent Germany. Diplomatically, Britain had entered the Entente cordiale in 1904 and the Anglo-Russian Entente. Neither France nor Russia posed a particular naval threat; the Russian navy had largely been sunk or captured in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905, while the French were in no hurry to adopt the new dreadnought-type design. Britain also boasted very cordial relations with two of the significant new naval powers: Japan (bolstered by the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, signed in 1902 and renewed in 1905), and the US. These changed strategic circumstances, and the great success of the &quot;Dreadnought&quot; ensured that she rather than the &quot;Invincible&quot; became the new model capital ship. Nevertheless, battlecruiser construction played a part in the renewed naval arms race sparked by the &quot;Dreadnought&quot;.
For their first few years of service, the &quot;Invincible&quot;s entirely fulfilled Fisher&#x27;s vision of being able to sink any ship fast enough to catch them, and run from any ship capable of sinking them. An &quot;Invincible&quot; would also, in many circumstances, be able to take on an enemy pre-dreadnought battleship. Naval circles concurred that the armoured cruiser in its current form had come to the logical end of its development and the &quot;Invincible&quot;s were so far ahead of any enemy armoured cruiser in firepower and speed that it proved difficult to justify building more or bigger cruisers. This lead was extended by the surprise both &quot;Dreadnought&quot; and &quot;Invincible&quot; produced by having been built in secret; this prompted most other navies to delay their building programmes and radically revise their designs. This was particularly true for cruisers, because the details of the &quot;Invincible&quot; class were kept secret for longer; this meant that the last German armoured cruiser, , was armed with only guns, and was no match for the new battlecruisers.

The Royal Navy&#x27;s early superiority in capital ships led to the rejection of a 1905–1906 design that would, essentially, have fused the battlecruiser and battleship concepts into what would eventually become the fast battleship. The &#x27;X4&#x27; design combined the full armour and armament of &quot;Dreadnought&quot; with the 25-knot speed of &quot;Invincible&quot;. The additional cost could not be justified given the existing British lead and the new Liberal government&#x27;s need for economy; the slower and cheaper , a relatively close copy of &quot;Dreadnought&quot;, was adopted instead. The X4 concept would eventually be fulfilled in the and later by other navies.

The next British battlecruisers were the three , slightly improved &quot;Invincible&quot;s built to fundamentally the same specification, partly due to political pressure to limit costs and partly due to the secrecy surrounding German battlecruiser construction, particularly about the heavy armour of . This class came to be widely seen as a mistake and the next generation of British battlecruisers were markedly more powerful. By 1909–1910 a sense of national crisis about rivalry with Germany outweighed cost-cutting, and a naval panic resulted in the approval of a total of eight capital ships in 1909–1910. Fisher pressed for all eight to be battlecruisers, but was unable to have his way; he had to settle for six battleships and two battlecruisers of the . The &quot;Lion&quot;s carried eight 13.5-inch guns, the now-standard caliber of the British &quot;super-dreadnought&quot; battleships. Speed increased to and armour protection, while not as good as in German designs, was better than in previous British battlecruisers, with armour belt and barbettes. The two &quot;Lion&quot;s were followed by the very similar .
By 1911 Germany had built battlecruisers of her own, and the superiority of the British ships could no longer be assured. Moreover, the German Navy did not share Fisher&#x27;s view of the battlecruiser. In contrast to the British focus on increasing speed and firepower, Germany progressively improved the armour and staying power of their ships to better the British battlecruisers. &quot;Von der Tann&quot;, begun in 1908 and completed in 1910, carried eight 11.1-inch guns, but with 11.1-inch (283 mm) armour she was far better protected than the &quot;Invincible&quot;s. The two s were quite similar but carried ten 11.1-inch guns of an improved design. , designed in 1909 and finished in 1913, was a modified &quot;Moltke&quot;; speed increased by one knot to , while her armour had a maximum thickness of 12 inches, equivalent to the s of a few years earlier. &quot;Seydlitz&quot; was Germany&#x27;s last battlecruiser completed before World War I.

The next step in battlecruiser design came from Japan. The Imperial Japanese Navy had been planning the ships from 1909, and was determined that, since the Japanese economy could support relatively few ships, each would be more powerful than its likely competitors. Initially the class was planned with the &quot;Invincible&quot;s as the benchmark. On learning of the British plans for &quot;Lion&quot;, and the likelihood that new U.S. Navy battleships would be armed with guns, the Japanese decided to radically revise their plans and go one better. A new plan was drawn up, carrying eight 14-inch guns, and capable of , thus marginally having the edge over the &quot;Lion&quot;s in speed and firepower. The heavy guns were also better-positioned, being superfiring both fore and aft with no turret amidships. The armour scheme was also marginally improved over the &quot;Lion&quot;s, with nine inches of armour on the turrets and on the barbettes. The first ship in the class was built in Britain, and a further three constructed in Japan. The Japanese also re-classified their powerful armoured cruisers of the &quot;Tsukuba&quot; and &quot;Ibuki&quot; classes, carrying four 12-inch guns, as battlecruisers; nonetheless, their armament was weaker and they were slower than any battlecruiser.
The next British battlecruiser, , was intended initially as the fourth ship in the &quot;Lion&quot; class, but was substantially redesigned. She retained the eight 13.5-inch guns of her predecessors, but they were positioned like those of &quot;Kongō&quot; for better fields of fire. She was faster (making on sea trials), and carried a heavier secondary armament. &quot;Tiger&quot; was also more heavily armoured on the whole; while the maximum thickness of armour was the same at nine inches, the height of the main armour belt was increased. Not all the desired improvements for this ship were approved, however. Her designer, Sir Eustace Tennyson d&#x27;Eyncourt, had wanted small-bore water-tube boilers and geared turbines to give her a speed of , but he received no support from the authorities and the engine makers refused his request.

1912 saw work begin on three more German battlecruisers of the , the first German battlecruisers to mount 12-inch guns. These ships, like &quot;Tiger&quot; and the &quot;Kongō&quot;s, had their guns arranged in superfiring turrets for greater efficiency. Their armour and speed was similar to the previous &quot;Seydlitz&quot; class. In 1913, the Russian Empire also began the construction of the four-ship , which were designed for service in the Baltic Sea. These ships were designed to carry twelve 14-inch guns, with armour up to 12 inches thick, and a speed of . The heavy armour and relatively slow speed of these ships made them more similar to German designs than to British ships; construction of the &quot;Borodino&quot;s was halted by the First World War and all were scrapped after the end of the Russian Civil War.

==World War I==

===Construction===
For most of the combatants, capital ship construction was very limited during the war. Germany finished the &quot;Derfflinger&quot; class and began work on the . The &quot;Mackensen&quot;s were a development of the &quot;Derfflinger&quot; class, with 13.8-inch guns and a broadly similar armour scheme, designed for .

In Britain, Jackie Fisher returned to the office of First Sea Lord in October 1914. His enthusiasm for big, fast ships was unabated, and he set designers to producing a design for a battlecruiser with 15-inch guns. Because Fisher expected the next German battlecruiser to steam at 28 knots, he required the new British design to be capable of 32 knots. He planned to reorder two s, which had been approved but not yet laid down, to a new design. Fisher finally received approval for this project on 28 December 1914 and they became the . With six 15-inch guns but only 6-inch armour they were a further step forward from &quot;Tiger&quot; in firepower and speed, but returned to the level of protection of the first British battlecruisers.

At the same time, Fisher resorted to subterfuge to obtain another three fast, lightly armoured ships that could use several spare gun turrets left over from battleship construction. These ships were essentially light battlecruisers, and Fisher occasionally referred to them as such, but officially they were classified as &quot;large light cruisers&quot;. This unusual designation was required because construction of new capital ships had been placed on hold, while there were no limits on light cruiser construction. They became and her sisters and , and there was a bizarre imbalance between their main guns of 15 inches (or in &quot;Furious&quot;) and their armour, which at thickness was on the scale of a light cruiser. The design was generally regarded as a failure (nicknamed in the Fleet &quot;Outrageous&quot;, &quot;Uproarious&quot; and &quot;Spurious&quot;), though the later conversion of the ships to aircraft carriers was very successful. Fisher also speculated about a new mammoth, but lightly built battlecruiser, that would carry guns, which he termed ; this never got beyond the concept stage.

It is often held that the &quot;Renown&quot; and &quot;Courageous&quot; classes were designed for Fisher&#x27;s plan to land troops (possibly Russian) on the German Baltic coast. Specifically, they were designed with a reduced draught, which might be important in the shallow Baltic. This is not clear-cut evidence that the ships were designed for the Baltic: it was considered that earlier ships had too much draught and not enough freeboard under operational conditions. Roberts argues that the focus on the Baltic was probably unimportant at the time the ships were designed, but was inflated later, after the disastrous Dardanelles Campaign.

The final British battlecruiser design of the war was the , which was born from a requirement for an improved version of the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; battleship. The project began at the end of 1915, after Fisher&#x27;s final departure from the Admiralty. While initially envisaged as a battleship, senior sea officers felt that Britain had enough battleships, but that new battlecruisers might be required to combat German ships being built (the British overestimated German progress on the &quot;Mackensen&quot; class as well as their likely capabilities). A battlecruiser design with eight 15-inch guns, 8 inches of armour and capable of 32 knots was decided on. The experience of battlecruisers at the Battle of Jutland meant that the design was radically revised and transformed again into a fast battleship with armour up to 12 inches thick, but still capable of . The first ship in the class, , was built according to this design to counter the possible completion of any of the Mackensen-class ship. The plans for her three sisters, on which little work had been done, were revised once more later in 1916 and in 1917 to improve protection.

The Admiral class would have been the only British ships capable of taking on the German &quot;Mackensen&quot; class; nevertheless, German shipbuilding was drastically slowed by the war, and while two &quot;Mackensen&quot;s were launched, none were ever completed. The Germans also worked briefly on a further three ships, of the , which were modified versions of the &quot;Mackensen&quot;s with 15-inch guns. Work on the three additional Admirals was suspended in March 1917 to enable more escorts and merchant ships to be built to deal with the new threat from U-boats to trade. They were finally cancelled in February 1919.

===Battlecruisers in action===
The first combat involving battlecruisers during World War I was the Battle of Heligoland Bight in August 1914. A force of British light cruisers and destroyers entered the Heligoland Bight (the part of the North Sea closest to Hamburg) to attack German destroyer patrols. When they met opposition from light cruisers, Vice Admiral David Beatty took his squadron of five battlecruisers into the Bight and turned the tide of the battle, ultimately sinking three German light cruisers and killing their commander, Rear Admiral Leberecht Maass.
The German battlecruiser perhaps made the most impact early in the war. Stationed in the Mediterranean, she and the escorting light cruiser evaded British and French ships on the outbreak of war, and steamed to Constantinople (Istanbul) with two British battlecruisers in hot pursuit. The two German ships were handed over to the Ottoman Navy, and this was instrumental in bringing the Ottoman Empire into the war as one of the Central Powers. &quot;Goeben&quot; herself, renamed &quot;Yavuz Sultan Selim&quot;, fought engagements against the Imperial Russian Navy in the Black Sea before being knocked out of the action for the remainder of the war after the Battle of Imbros against British forces in the Aegean Sea in January 1918.

The original battlecruiser concept proved successful in December 1914 at the Battle of the Falkland Islands. The British battlecruisers and did precisely the job for which they were intended when they chased down and annihilated the German East Asia Squadron, centered on the armoured cruisers and , along with three light cruisers, commanded by Admiral Maximilian Graf Von Spee, in the South Atlantic Ocean. Prior to the battle, the Australian battlecruiser had unsuccessfully searched for the German ships in the Pacific.
During the Battle of Dogger Bank in 1915, the aftermost barbette of the German flagship &quot;Seydlitz&quot; was struck by a British 13.5-inch shell from HMS &quot;Lion&quot;. The shell did not penetrate the barbette, but it dislodged a piece of the barbette armour that allowed the flame from the shell&#x27;s detonation to enter the barbette. The propellant charges being hoisted upwards were ignited, and the fireball flashed up into the turret and down into the magazine, setting fire to charges removed from their brass cartridge cases. The gun crew tried to escape into the next turret, which allowed the flash to spread into that turret as well, killing the crews of both turrets. &quot;Seydlitz&quot; was saved from near-certain destruction only by emergency flooding of her after magazines, which had been effected by Wilhelm Heidkamp. This near-disaster was due to the way that ammunition handling was arranged and was common to both German and British battleships and battlecruisers, but the lighter protection on the latter made them more vulnerable to the turret or barbette being penetrated. The Germans learned from investigating the damaged &quot;Seydlitz&quot; and instituted measures to ensure that ammunition handling minimised any possible exposure to flash.

Apart from the cordite handling, the battle was mostly inconclusive, though both the British flagship &quot;Lion&quot; and &quot;Seydlitz&quot; were severely damaged. &quot;Lion&quot; lost speed, causing her to fall behind the rest of the battleline, and Beatty was unable to effectively command his ships for the remainder of the engagement. A British signalling error allowed the German battlecruisers to withdraw, as most of Beatty&#x27;s squadron mistakenly concentrated on the crippled armoured cruiser &quot;Blücher&quot;, sinking her with great loss of life. The British blamed their failure to win a decisive victory on their poor gunnery and attempted to increase their rate of fire by stockpiling unprotected cordite charges in their ammunition hoists and barbettes.

At the Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916, both British and German battlecruisers were employed as fleet units. The British battlecruisers became engaged with both their German counterparts, the battlecruisers, and then German battleships before the arrival of the battleships of the British Grand Fleet. The result was a disaster for the Royal Navy&#x27;s battlecruiser squadrons: &quot;Invincible&quot;, &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, and exploded with the loss of all but a handful of their crews. The exact reason why the ships&#x27; magazines detonated is not known, but the abundance of exposed cordite charges stored in their turrets, ammunition hoists and working chambers in the quest to increase their rate of fire undoubtedly contributed to their loss. Beatty&#x27;s flagship &quot;Lion&quot; herself was almost lost in a similar manner, save for the heroic actions of Major Francis Harvey.

The better-armoured German battlecruisers fared better, in part due to the poor performance of British fuzes (the British shells tended to explode or break up on impact with the German armour). —the only German battlecruiser lost at Jutland—had only 128 killed, for instance, despite receiving more than thirty hits. The other German battlecruisers, , &quot;Von der Tann&quot;, &quot;Seydlitz&quot;, and , were all heavily damaged and required extensive repairs after the battle, &quot;Seydlitz&quot; barely making it home, for they had been the focus of British fire for much of the battle.

==Interwar period==
In the years immediately after World War I, Britain, Japan and the US all began design work on a new generation of ever more powerful battleships and battlecruisers. The new burst of shipbuilding that each nation&#x27;s navy desired was politically controversial and potentially economically crippling. This nascent arms race was prevented by the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, where the major naval powers agreed to limits on capital ship numbers. The German navy was not represented at the talks; under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was not allowed any modern capital ships at all.

Through the 1920s and 1930s only Britain and Japan retained battlecruisers, often modified and rebuilt from their original designs. The line between the battlecruiser and the modern fast battleship became blurred; indeed, the Japanese &quot;Kongō&quot;s were formally redesignated as battleships after their very comprehensive reconstruction in the 1930s.

===Plans in the aftermath of World War I===

&quot;Hood&quot;, launched in 1918, was the last World War I battlecruiser to be completed. Owing to lessons from Jutland, the ship was modified during construction; the thickness of her belt armour was increased by an average of 50 percent and extended substantially, she was given heavier deck armour, and the protection of her magazines was improved to guard against the ignition of ammunition. This was hoped to be capable of resisting her own weapons—the classic measure of a &quot;balanced&quot; battleship. &quot;Hood&quot; was the largest ship in the Royal Navy when completed; because of her great displacement, in theory she combined the firepower and armour of a battleship with the speed of a battlecruiser, causing some to refer to her as a fast battleship. However, her protection was markedly less than that of the British battleships built immediately after World War I, the .
The navies of Japan and the United States, not being affected immediately by the war, had time to develop new heavy guns for their latest designs and to refine their battlecruiser designs in light of combat experience in Europe. The Imperial Japanese Navy began four s. These vessels would have been of unprecedented size and power, as fast and well armoured as &quot;Hood&quot; whilst carrying a main battery of ten 16-inch guns, the most powerful armament ever proposed for a battlecruiser. They were, for all intents and purposes, fast battleships—the only differences between them and the s which were to precede them were less side armour and a increase in speed. The United States Navy, which had worked on its battlecruiser designs since 1913 and watched the latest developments in this class with great care, responded with the . If completed as planned, they would have been exceptionally fast and well armed with eight 16-inch guns, but carried armour little better than the &quot;Invincible&quot;s—this after an increase in protection following Jutland. The final stage in the post-war battlecruiser race came with the British response to the &quot;Amagi&quot; and &quot;Lexington&quot; types: four G3 battlecruisers. Royal Navy documents of the period often described any battleship with a speed of over about as a battlecruiser, regardless of the amount of protective armour, although the G3 was considered by most to be a well-balanced fast battleship.

The Washington Naval Treaty meant that none of these designs came to fruition. Ships that had been started were either broken up on the slipway or converted to aircraft carriers. In Japan, &quot;Amagi&quot; and were selected for conversion. &quot;Amagi&quot; was damaged beyond repair by the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake and was broken up for scrap; the hull of one of the proposed &quot;Tosa&quot;-class battleships, , was converted in her stead. The United States Navy also converted two battlecruiser hulls into aircraft carriers in the wake of the Washington Treaty: and , although this was only considered marginally preferable to scrapping the hulls outright (the remaining four: &quot;Constellation&quot;, &quot;Ranger&quot;, &quot;Constitution&quot; and &quot;United States&quot; were scrapped). In Britain, Fisher&#x27;s &quot;large light cruisers,&quot; were converted to carriers. &quot;Furious&quot; had already been partially converted during the war and &quot;Glorious&quot; and &quot;Courageous&quot; were similarly converted.

===Rebuilding programmes===

In total, nine battlecruisers survived the Washington Naval Treaty, although HMS &quot;Tiger&quot; later became a victim of the London Naval Conference 1930 and was scrapped. Because their high speed made them valuable surface units in spite of their weaknesses, most of these ships were significantly updated before World War II. and were modernized significantly in the 1920s and 1930s. Between 1934 and 1936, &quot;Repulse&quot; was partially modernized and had her bridge modified, an aircraft hangar, catapult and new gunnery equipment added and her anti-aircraft armament increased. &quot;Renown&quot; underwent a more thorough reconstruction between 1937 and 1939. Her deck armour was increased, new turbines and boilers were fitted, an aircraft hangar and catapult added and she was completely rearmed aside from the main guns which had their elevation increased to +30 degrees. The bridge structure was also removed and a large bridge similar to that used in the battleships installed in its place. While conversions of this kind generally added weight to the vessel, &quot;Renown&quot;″s tonnage actually decreased due to a substantially lighter power plant. Similar thorough rebuildings planned for &quot;Repulse&quot; and &quot;Hood&quot; were cancelled due to the advent of World War II.

Unable to build new ships, the Imperial Japanese Navy also chose to improve its existing battlecruisers of the &quot;Kongō&quot; class (initially the , , and —the only later as it had been disarmed under the terms of the Washington treaty) in two substantial reconstructions (one for &quot;Hiei&quot;). During the first of these, elevation of their main guns was increased to +40 degrees, anti-torpedo bulges and of horizontal armour added, and a &quot;pagoda&quot; mast with additional command positions built up. This reduced the ships&#x27; speed to . The second reconstruction focused on speed as they had been selected as fast escorts for aircraft carrier task forces. Completely new main engines, a reduced number of boilers and an increase in hull length by allowed them to reach up to 30 knots once again. They were reclassified as &quot;fast battleships,&quot; although their armour and guns still fell short compared to surviving World War I–era battleships in the American or the British navies, with dire consequences during the Pacific War, when &quot;Hiei&quot; and &quot;Kirishima&quot; were easily crippled by US gunfire during actions off Guadalcanal, forcing their scuttling shortly afterwards. Perhaps most tellingly, &quot;Hiei&quot; was crippled by medium-caliber gunfire from heavy and light cruisers in a close-range night engagement.

There were two exceptions: Turkey&#x27;s &quot;Yavuz Sultan Selim&quot; and the Royal Navy&#x27;s &quot;Hood&quot;. The Turkish Navy made only minor improvements to the ship in the interwar period, which primarily focused on repairing wartime damage and the installation of new fire control systems and anti-aircraft batteries. &quot;Hood&quot; was in constant service with the fleet and could not be withdrawn for an extended reconstruction. She received minor improvements over the course of the 1930s, including modern fire control systems, increased numbers of anti-aircraft guns, and in March 1941, radar.

===Naval rearmament===
In the late 1930s navies began to build capital ships again, and during this period a number of large commerce raiders and small, fast battleships were built that are sometimes referred to as battlecruisers, such as the s and s and the French s . The &quot;Deutschland&quot;-class was all but in name a heavy cruiser but upgunned at the cost of speed. The &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;-class have been occasionally referred in English language reference works as battlecruisers due to their weak armament while having high speed and being well-protected, similar to how Kaiserliche Marine battlecruisers were designed. The &quot;Dunkerque&quot;s have sometimes been classified as battlecruisers, being smaller and less heavily armed and armoured than all other treaty battleships, however they were a balanced design of speed, protection, and firepower. Their design was later scaled up for the &quot;Richelieu&quot;-class fast battleship that maximized treaty allowances.

Germany and Russia designed new battlecruisers during this period, though only the latter laid down two of the 35,000-ton . They were still on the slipways when the Germans invaded in 1941 and construction was suspended. Both ships were scrapped after the war. The Germans planned three battlecruisers of the as part of the expansion of the Kriegsmarine (Plan Z). With six 15-inch guns, high speed, excellent range, but very thin armour, they were intended as commerce raiders. Only one was ordered shortly before World War II; no work was ever done on it. No names were assigned, and they were known by their contract names: &#x27;O&#x27;, &#x27;P&#x27;, and &#x27;Q&#x27;. The new class was not universally welcomed in the Kriegsmarine. Their abnormally-light protection gained it the derogatory nickname &quot;Ohne Panzer Quatsch&quot; (without armour nonsense) within certain circles of the Navy.

==World War II==

The Royal Navy deployed some of its battlecruisers during the Norwegian Campaign in April 1940. The and the were engaged during the action off Lofoten by &quot;Renown&quot; in very bad weather and disengaged after &quot;Gneisenau&quot; was damaged. One of &quot;Renown&quot;″s 15-inch shells passed through &quot;Gneisenau&quot;″s director-control tower without exploding, severing electrical and communication cables as it went and destroyed the rangefinders for the forward 150 mm (5.9 in) turrets. Main-battery fire control had to be shifted aft due to the loss of electrical power. Another shell from &quot;Renown&quot; knocked out &quot;Gneisenau&quot;″s aft turret. The British ship was struck twice by German shells that failed to inflict any significant damage. She was the only pre-war battlecruiser to survive the war.

In the early years of the war various German ships had a measure of success hunting merchant ships in the Atlantic. Allied battlecruisers such as &quot;Renown&quot;, &quot;Repulse&quot;, and the fast battleships &quot;Dunkerque&quot; and were employed on operations to hunt down the commerce-raiding German ships. The one stand-up fight occurred when the battleship and the heavy cruiser sortied into the North Atlantic to attack British shipping and were intercepted by &quot;Hood&quot; and the battleship in May 1941 in the Battle of the Denmark Strait. &quot;Hood&quot; was destroyed when the &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s 15-inch shells caused a magazine explosion. Only three men survived.

The first battlecruiser to see action in the Pacific War was &quot;Repulse&quot; when she was sunk by Japanese torpedo bombers north of Singapore on 10 December 1941 whilst in company with &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;. She was lightly damaged by a single bomb and near-missed by two others in the first Japanese attack. Her speed and agility enabled her to avoid the other attacks by level bombers and dodge 33 torpedoes. The last group of torpedo bombers attacked from multiple directions and &quot;Repulse&quot; was struck by five torpedoes. She quickly capsized with the loss of 27 officers and 486 crewmen; 42 officers and 754 enlisted men were rescued by the escorting destroyers. The loss of &quot;Repulse&quot; and &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; conclusively proved the vulnerability of capital ships to aircraft without air cover of their own.

The Japanese &quot;Kongō&quot;-class battlecruisers were extensively used as carrier escorts for most of their wartime career due to their high speed. Although classified as fast battleships by the Japanese, their World War I–era armament was weaker and their upgraded armour was still thin compared to contemporary battleships. On 13 November 1942, during the First Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, &quot;Hiei&quot; stumbled across American cruisers and destroyers at point-blank range. The ship was badly damaged in the encounter and had to be towed by her sister ship &quot;Kirishima&quot;. Both were spotted by American aircraft the following morning and &quot;Kirishima&quot; was forced to cast off her tow because of repeated aerial attacks. &quot;Hiei&quot;″s captain ordered her crew to abandon ship after further damage and scuttled &quot;Hiei&quot; in the early evening of 14 November. On the night of 14/15 November during the Second Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, &quot;Kirishima&quot; returned to Ironbottom Sound, but encountered the American battleships and . While failing to detect &quot;Washington&quot;, &quot;Kirishima&quot; engaged &quot;South Dakota&quot; with some effect. &quot;Washington&quot; opened fire a few minutes later at short range and badly damaged &quot;Kirishima&quot;, knocking out her aft turrets, jamming her rudder, and hitting the ship below the waterline. The flooding proved to be uncontrollable and &quot;Kirishima&quot; capsized three and a half hours later.

Returning to Japan after the Battle of Leyte Gulf, &quot;Kongō&quot; was torpedoed and sunk by the American submarine on 21 November 1944. &quot;Haruna&quot; was moored at Kure, Japan when the naval base was attacked by American carrier aircraft on 24 and 28 July 1945. The ship was only lightly damaged by a single bomb hit on 24 July, but was hit a dozen more times on 28 July and sank at her pier. She was refloated after the war and scrapped in early 1946.

===Large cruisers or &quot;cruiser killers&quot;===


A late renaissance in popularity of ships between battleships and cruisers in size occurred on the eve of World War II. Described by some as battlecruisers, but never classified as capital ships, they were variously described as &quot;super cruisers&quot;, &quot;large cruisers&quot; or even &quot;unrestricted cruisers&quot;. The Dutch, American, and Japanese navies all planned these new classes specifically to counter the heavy cruisers, or their counterparts, being built by their naval rivals.

The first such battlecruisers were the Dutch Design 1047, designed to protect their colonies in the East Indies in the face of Japanese aggression. Never officially assigned names, these ships were designed with German and Italian assistance. While they broadly resembled the German &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; class and had the same main battery, they would have been more lightly armoured and only protected against eight-inch gunfire. Although the design was mostly completed, work on the vessels never commenced as the Germans overran the Netherlands in May 1940. The first ship would have been laid down in June of that year.

The only class of these late battlecruisers actually built were the United States Navy&#x27;s &quot;large cruisers&quot;. Two of them were completed, and ; a third, , was cancelled while under construction and three others, to be named &quot;Philippines&quot;, &quot;Puerto Rico&quot; and &quot;Samoa&quot;, were cancelled before they were laid down. The USN classified them &quot;large cruisers&quot; instead of battlecruisers. These ships were named after territories or protectorates, while battleships were named after states and cruisers after cities. With a displacement of and a main armament of nine 12-inch guns in three triple turrets, they were twice the size of s and had guns some 50% larger in diameter. The &quot;Alaska&quot;s design was a scaled-up cruiser rather than a lighter/faster battleship derivative, as they lacked the thick armoured belt and intricate torpedo defence system of contemporary battleships. However, unlike World War I-era battlecruisers, the &quot;Alaska&quot;s were considered a balanced design according to cruiser standards as their protection could withstand fire from their own caliber of gun, albeit only in a very narrow range band. They were designed to hunt down Japanese heavy cruisers, though by the time they entered service most Japanese cruisers had been sunk by American aircraft or submarines. Like the contemporary fast battleships, their speed ultimately made them more useful as carrier escorts and bombardment ships than as the surface combatants they were developed to be.

The Japanese started designing the B64 class, which was similar to the &quot;Alaska&quot; but with guns. News of the &quot;Alaska&quot;s led them to upgrade the design, creating Design B-65. Armed with 356 mm guns, the B65s would have been the best armed of the new breed of battlecruisers, but they still would have had only sufficient protection to keep out eight-inch shells. Much like the Dutch, the Japanese got as far as completing the design for the B65s, but never laid them down. By the time the designs were ready the Japanese Navy recognized that they had little use for the vessels and that their priority for construction should lie with aircraft carriers. Like the &quot;Alaska&quot;s, the Japanese did not call these ships battlecruisers, referring to them instead as super-heavy cruisers.

==Cold War–era designs==

In spite of the fact that most navies abandoned the battleship and battlecruiser concepts after World War II, Joseph Stalin&#x27;s fondness for big-gun-armed warships caused the Soviet Union to plan a large cruiser class in the late 1940s. In the Soviet Navy, they were termed &quot;heavy cruisers&quot; (&quot;tjazholyj krejser&quot;). The fruits of this program were the Project 82 (&quot;Stalingrad&quot;) cruisers, of standard load, nine guns and a speed of . Three ships were laid down in 1951–1952, but they were cancelled in April 1953 after Stalin&#x27;s death. Only the central armoured hull section of the first ship, &quot;Stalingrad&quot;, was launched in 1954 and then used as a target.

The Soviet is sometimes referred to as a battlecruiser. This description arises from their over displacement, which is roughly equal to that of a First World War battleship and more than twice the displacement of contemporary cruisers; upon entry into service, &quot;Kirov&quot; was the largest surface combatant to be built since World War II. The &quot;Kirov&quot; class lacks the armour that distinguishes battlecruisers from ordinary cruisers and they are classified as heavy nuclear-powered missile cruisers (&quot;Тяжелый Атомный Ракетный Крейсер&quot; (ТАРКР)) by Russia, with their primary surface armament consisting of twenty P-700 Granit surface to surface missiles. Four members of the class were completed during the 1980s and 1990s, but due to budget constraints only the is operational with the Russian Navy, though plans were announced in 2010 to return the other three ships to service. As of 2021, was being refitted, but the other two ships are reportedly beyond economical repair.
