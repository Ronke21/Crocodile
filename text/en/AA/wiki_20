<text>AOL (formerly a company known as AOL Inc. and originally known as America Online) is an American web portal and online service provider based in New York City, and a brand marketed by Yahoo! Inc.

The service traces its history to an online service known as PlayNET. PlayNET licensed its software to Quantum Link (Q-Link), which went online in November 1985. A new IBM PC client was launched in 1988, and eventually renamed as America Online in 1989. AOL grew to become the largest online service, displacing established players like CompuServe and The Source. By 1995, AOL had about three million active users.

AOL was at one point the most recognized brand on the Web in the United States. AOL once provided a dial-up Internet service to millions of Americans and pioneered instant messaging and chat rooms with AOL Instant Messenger (AIM). In 1998, AOL purchased Netscape for US$4.2 billion. By 2000, AOL was providing internet service to over 20 million consumers, dominating the market of Internet service providers (ISPs). In 2001, at the height of its popularity, it purchased the media conglomerate Time Warner in the largest merger in US history. AOL shrank rapidly thereafter, partly due to the decline of dial-up and rise of broadband. AOL was eventually spun off from Time Warner in 2009, with Tim Armstrong appointed the new CEO. Under his leadership, the company invested in media brands and advertising technologies.

On June 23, 2015, AOL was acquired by Verizon Communications for $4.4 billion. On May 3, 2021, Verizon announced it would sell Yahoo and AOL to private equity firm Apollo Global Management for $5 billion. On September 1, 2021, AOL became part of the new Yahoo! Inc.

== History ==
=== 1983–1991: early years ===
AOL began in 1983, as a short-lived venture called Control Video Corporation (CVC), founded by William von Meister. Its sole product was an online service called GameLine for the Atari 2600 video game console, after von Meister&#x27;s idea of buying music on demand was rejected by Warner Bros. Subscribers bought a modem from the company for $49.95 and paid a one-time $15 setup fee. GameLine permitted subscribers to temporarily download games and keep track of high scores, at a cost of $1 per game. The telephone disconnected and the downloaded game would remain in GameLine&#x27;s Master Module, playable until the user turned off the console or downloaded another game.

In January 1983, Steve Case was hired as a marketing consultant for Control Video on the recommendation of his brother, investment banker Dan Case. In May 1983, Jim Kimsey became a manufacturing consultant for Control Video, which was near bankruptcy. Kimsey was brought in by his West Point friend Frank Caufield, an investor in the company. In early 1985, von Meister left the company.

On May 24, 1985, Quantum Computer Services, an online services company, was founded by Kimsey from the remnants of Control Video, with Kimsey as chief executive officer and Marc Seriff as chief technology officer. The technical team consisted of Seriff, Tom Ralston, Ray Heinrich, Steve Trus, Ken Huntsman, Janet Hunter, Dave Brown, Craig Dykstra, Doug Coward, and Mike Ficco. In 1987, Case was promoted again to executive vice-president. Kimsey soon began to groom Case to take over the role of CEO, which he did when Kimsey retired in 1991.

Kimsey changed the company&#x27;s strategy, and in 1985, launched a dedicated online service for Commodore 64 and 128 computers, originally called Quantum Link (&quot;Q-Link&quot; for short). The Quantum Link software was based on software licensed from PlayNet, Inc., which was founded in 1983 by Howard Goldberg and Dave Panzl. The service was different from other online services as it used the computing power of the Commodore 64 and the Apple II rather than just a &quot;dumb&quot; terminal. It passed tokens back and forth and provided a fixed-price service tailored for home users. In May 1988, Quantum and Apple launched AppleLink Personal Edition for Apple II and Macintosh computers. In August 1988, Quantum launched PC Link, a service for IBM-compatible PCs developed in a joint venture with the Tandy Corporation. After the company parted ways with Apple in October 1989, Quantum changed the service&#x27;s name to America Online. Case promoted and sold AOL as the online service for people unfamiliar with computers, in contrast to CompuServe, which was well established in the technical community.

From the beginning, AOL included online games in its mix of products; many classic and casual games were included in the original PlayNet software system. The company introduced many innovative online interactive titles and games, including:
* Graphical chat environments &quot;Habitat&quot; (1986–1988) from LucasArts.
* The first online interactive fiction series QuantumLink Serial by Tracy Reed (1988).
* &quot;Quantum Space&quot;, the first fully automated play-by-mail game (1989–1991).

=== 1991–2006: Internet age, Time Warner merger ===

In February 1991, AOL for DOS was launched using a GeoWorks interface; it was followed a year later by AOL for Windows. This coincided with growth in pay-based online services, like Prodigy, CompuServe, and GEnie. 1991 also saw the introduction of an original Dungeons &amp; Dragons title called &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; from Stormfront Studios, one of the first Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games to depict the adventure with graphics instead of text.

During the early 1990s, the average subscription lasted for about 25 months and accounted for $350 in total revenue. Advertisements invited modem owners to &quot;Try America Online FREE&quot;, promising free software and trial membership. AOL discontinued Q-Link and PC Link in late 1994. In September 1993, AOL added Usenet access to its features. This is commonly referred to as the &quot;Eternal September&quot;, as Usenet&#x27;s cycle of new users was previously dominated by smaller numbers of college and university freshmen gaining access in September and taking a few weeks to acclimate. This also coincided with a new &quot;carpet bombing&quot; marketing campaign by CMO Jan Brandt to distribute as many free trial AOL trial disks as possible through nonconventional distribution partners. At one point, 50% of the CDs produced worldwide had an AOL logo. AOL quickly surpassed GEnie, and by the mid-1990s, it passed Prodigy (which for several years allowed AOL advertising) and CompuServe. In November 1994, AOL purchased Booklink for its web browser, to give its users web access. In 1996, AOL replaced Booklink with a browser based on Internet Explorer, reportedly in exchange for inclusion of AOL in Windows.

AOL launched services with the National Education Association, the American Federation of Teachers, &quot;National Geographic&quot;, the Smithsonian Institution, the Library of Congress, Pearson, Scholastic, ASCD, NSBA, NCTE, Discovery Networks, Turner Education Services (CNN Newsroom), NPR, The Princeton Review, Stanley Kaplan, Barron&#x27;s, Highlights for Kids, the US Department of Education, and many other education providers. AOL offered the first real-time homework help service (the Teacher Pager—1990; prior to this, AOL provided homework help bulletin boards), the first service by children, for children (Kids Only Online, 1991), the first online service for parents (the Parents Information Network, 1991), the first online courses (1988), the first omnibus service for teachers (the Teachers&#x27; Information Network, 1990), the first online exhibit (Library of Congress, 1991), the first parental controls, and many other online education firsts.

AOL purchased search engine WebCrawler in 1995, but sold it to Excite the following year; the deal made Excite the sole search and directory service on AOL. After the deal closed in March 1997, AOL launched its own branded search engine, based on Excite, called NetFind. This was renamed to AOL Search in 1999.
AOL charged its users an hourly fee until December 1996, when the company changed to a flat monthly rate of $19.95. During this time, AOL connections were flooded with users trying to connect, and many canceled their accounts due to constant busy signals. A commercial was made featuring Steve Case telling people AOL was working day and night to fix the problem. Within three years, AOL&#x27;s user base grew to 10 million people. In 1995, AOL was headquartered at 8619 Westwood Center Drive in the Tysons Corner CDP in unincorporated Fairfax County, Virginia, near the Town of Vienna.

AOL was quickly running out of room in October 1996 for its network at the Fairfax County campus. In mid-1996, AOL moved to 22000 AOL Way in Dulles, unincorporated Loudoun County, Virginia to provide room for future growth. In a five-year landmark agreement with the most popular operating system, AOL was bundled with Windows software.

On March 31, 1996, the short-lived eWorld was purchased by AOL. In 1997, about half of all US homes with Internet access had it through AOL. During this time, AOL&#x27;s content channels, under Jason Seiken, including News, Sports, and Entertainment, experienced their greatest growth as AOL become the dominant online service internationally with more than 34 million subscribers.

In February 1998, AOL acquired CompuServe Interactive Services (CIS) via WorldCom (later Verizon), which kept Compuware&#x27;s networking business.

In November 1998, AOL announced it would acquire Netscape, best known for their web browser, in a major $4.2 billion deal. The deal closed on March 17, 1999. Another large acquisition in December 1999 was that of MapQuest, for $1.1 billion.
In January 2000, as new broadband technologies were being rolled out around the New York City metropolitan area and elsewhere across the US, AOL and Time Warner Entertainment announced plans to merge, forming AOL Time Warner, Inc. The terms of the deal called for AOL shareholders to own 55% of the new, combined company. The deal closed on January 11, 2001. The new company was led by executives from AOL, SBI, and Time Warner. Gerald Levin, who had served as CEO of Time Warner, was CEO of the new company. Steve Case served as chairman, J. Michael Kelly (from AOL) was the chief financial officer, Robert W. Pittman (from AOL) and Dick Parsons (from Time Warner) served as co-chief operating officers. In 2002, Jonathan Miller became CEO of AOL. The following year, AOL Time Warner dropped the &quot;AOL&quot; from its name. It was the largest merger in history when completed with the combined value of the companies at $360 billion. This value fell sharply, to as low as $120 billion, as markets repriced AOL&#x27;s valuation as a pure internet firm more modestly when combined with the traditional media and cable business. This status did not last long, and the company&#x27;s value rose again within three months. By the end of that year, the tide had turned against &quot;pure&quot; internet companies, with many collapsing under falling stock prices, and even the strongest companies in the field losing up to 75% of their market value. The decline continued though 2001, but even with the losses, AOL was among the internet giants that continued to outperform brick and mortar companies.

In 2004, along with the launch of AOL 9.0 Optimized, AOL also made available the option of personalized greetings which would enable the user to hear his or her name while accessing basic functions and mail alerts, or while logging in or out. In 2005, AOL broadcast the Live 8 concert live over the Internet, and thousands of users downloaded clips of the concert over the following months. In late 2005, AOL released AOL Safety &amp; Security Center, a bundle of McAfee Antivirus, CA anti-spyware, and proprietary firewall and phishing protection software. News reports in late 2005 identified companies such as Yahoo!, Microsoft, and Google as candidates for turning AOL into a joint venture. Those plans were abandoned when it was revealed on December 20, 2005, that Google would purchase a 5% share of AOL for $1 billion.

=== 2006–2009: rebranding and decline ===

On April 3, 2006, AOL announced that it would retire the full name America Online. The official name of the service became AOL, and the full name of the Time Warner subdivision became AOL LLC. On June 8, 2006, AOL offered a new program called AOL Active Security Monitor, a diagnostic tool to monitor and rate PC security status, and recommended additional security software from AOL or Download.com. Two months later, AOL released AOL Active Virus Shield, a free product developed by Kaspersky Lab, that did not require an AOL account, only an internet email address. The ISP side of AOL UK was bought by Carphone Warehouse in October 2006 to take advantage of its 100,000 LLU customers, making Carphone Warehouse the largest LLU provider in the UK.
In August 2006, AOL announced that it would offer email accounts and software previously available only to its paying customers, provided that users accessed AOL or AOL.com through an access method not owned by AOL (otherwise known as &quot;third party transit&quot;, &quot;bring your own access&quot; or &quot;BYOA&quot;). The move was designed to reduce costs associated with the &quot;walled garden&quot; business model by reducing usage of AOL-owned access points and shifting members with high-speed internet access from client-based usage to the more lucrative advertising provider AOL.com. The change from paid to free access was also designed to slow the rate at which members canceled their accounts and defected to Microsoft Hotmail, Yahoo! or other free email providers. The other free services included:
* AIM (AOL Instant Messenger)
* AOL Video, which featured professional content and allowed users to upload videos.
* AOL Local, comprising its CityGuide, Yellow Pages and Local Search services to help users find local information like restaurants, local events, and directory listings.
* AOL News
* AOL My eAddress, a custom domain name for email addresses. These email accounts could be accessed in a manner similar to those of other AOL and AIM email accounts.
* Xdrive, which allowed users to back up files over the Internet. It was acquired by AOL on August 4, 2005, and closed on December 31, 2008. It offered a free 5 GB account (free online file storage) to anyone with an AOL screenname. Xdrive also provided remote backup services and 50 GB of storage for $9.95 per month.

Also in August, AOL informed its US customers of an increase in the price of its dial-up access to $25.90. The increase was part of an effort to migrate the service&#x27;s remaining dial-up users to broadband, as the increased price was the same as that of its monthly DSL access. However, AOL subsequently began offering unlimited dial-up access for $9.95 a month.

On November 16, 2006, Randy Falco succeeded Jonathan Miller as CEO. In December 2006, AOL closed its last remaining call center in the United States, &quot;taking the America out of America Online,&quot; according to industry pundits. Service centers based in India and the Philippines continue to provide customer support and technical assistance to subscribers.
On September 17, 2007, AOL announced the relocation of one of its corporate headquarters from Dulles, Virginia to New York City and the combination of its advertising units into a new subsidiary called Platform A. This action followed several advertising acquisitions, most notably Advertising.com, and highlighted the company&#x27;s new focus on advertising-driven business models. AOL management stressed that &quot;significant operations&quot; would remain in Dulles, which included the company&#x27;s access services and modem banks.

In October 2007, AOL announced the relocation of its other headquarters from Loudoun County, Virginia to New York City, while continuing to operate its Virginia offices. As part of the move to New York and the restructuring of responsibilities at the Dulles headquarters complex after the Reston move, Falco announced on October 15, 2007, plans to lay off 2,000 employees worldwide by the end of 2007, beginning &quot;immediately&quot;. The result was a layoff of approximately 40% of AOL&#x27;s employees. Most compensation packages associated with the October 2007 layoffs included a minimum of 120 days of severance pay, 60 of which were offered in lieu of the 60-day advance notice requirement by provisions of the 1988 federal WARN Act.

By November 2007, AOL&#x27;s customer base had been reduced to 10.1 million subscribers, slightly more than the number of subscribers of Comcast and AT&amp;T Yahoo!. According to Falco, as of December 2007, the conversion rate of accounts from paid access to free access was more than 80%.

On January 3, 2008, AOL announced the closing of its Reston, Virginia, data center, which was sold to CRG West. On February 6, Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes announced that Time Warner would divide AOL&#x27;s internet-access and advertising businesses, with the possibility of later selling the internet-access division.

On March 13, 2008, AOL purchased the social networking site Bebo for $850 million (£417 million). On July 25, AOL announced that it was shuttering Xdrive, AOL Pictures and BlueString to save on costs and focus on its core advertising business. AOL Pictures was closed on December 31. On October 31, AOL Hometown (a web-hosting service for the websites of AOL customers) and the AOL Journal blog hosting service were eliminated.

=== 2009–2015: As a digital media company ===

On March 12, 2009, Tim Armstrong, formerly with Google, was named chairman and CEO of AOL. On May 28, Time Warner announced that it would position AOL as an independent company after Google&#x27;s shares ceased at the end of the fiscal year. On November 23, AOL unveiled a new brand identity with the wordmark &quot;Aol.&quot; superimposed onto canvases created by commissioned artists. The new identity, designed by Wolff Olins, was integrated with all of AOL&#x27;s services on December 10, the date upon which AOL traded independently for the first time since the Time Warner merger on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol AOL.

On April 6, 2010, AOL announced plans to shutter or sell Bebo. On June 16, the property was sold to Criterion Capital Partners for an undisclosed amount, believed to be approximately $10 million. In December, AIM eliminated access to AOL chat rooms, noting a marked decline in usage in recent months.

Under Armstrong&#x27;s leadership, AOL followed a new business direction marked by a series of acquisitions. It announced the acquisition of Patch Media, a network of community-specific news and information sites focused on towns and communities. On September 28, 2010, at the San Francisco TechCrunch Disrupt Conference, AOL signed an agreement to acquire TechCrunch. On December 12, 2010, AOL acquired about.me, a personal profile and identity platform, four days after the platform&#x27;s public launch.

On January 31, 2011, AOL announced the acquisition of European video distribution network goviral. In March 2011, AOL acquired &quot;HuffPost&quot; for $315 million. Shortly after the acquisition was announced, &quot;Huffington Post&quot; co-founder Arianna Huffington replaced AOL content chief David Eun, assuming the role of president and editor-in-chief of the AOL Huffington Post Media Group. On March 10, AOL announced that it would cut approximately 900 workers following the &quot;HuffPost&quot; acquisition.

On September 14, 2011, AOL formed a strategic ad-selling partnership with two of its largest competitors, Yahoo and Microsoft. The three companies would begin selling inventory on each other&#x27;s sites. The strategy was designed to help the companies compete with Google and advertising networks.

On February 28, 2012, AOL partnered with PBS to launch MAKERS, a digital documentary series focusing on high-achieving women in industries perceived as male-dominated such as war, comedy, space, business, Hollywood and politics. Subjects for MAKERS episodes have included Oprah Winfrey, Hillary Clinton, Sheryl Sandberg, Martha Stewart, Indra Nooyi, Lena Dunham and Ellen DeGeneres.

On March 15, 2012, AOL announced the acquisition of Hipster, a mobile photo-sharing app, for an undisclosed amount. On April 9, 2012, AOL announced a deal to sell 800 patents to Microsoft for $1.056 billion. The deal included a perpetual license for AOL to use the patents.

In April, AOL took several steps to expand its ability to generate revenue through online video advertising. The company announced that it would offer gross rating point (GRP) guarantee for online video, mirroring the television-ratings system and guaranteeing audience delivery for online-video advertising campaigns bought across its properties. This announcement came just days before the Digital Content NewFront (DCNF) a two-week event held by AOL, Google, Hulu, Microsoft, Vevo and Yahoo to showcase the participating sites&#x27; digital video offerings. The DCNF was conducted in advance of the traditional television upfronts in the hope of diverting more advertising money into the digital space. On April 24, the company launched the AOL On network, a single website for its video output.

In February 2013, AOL reported its fourth quarter revenue of $599.5 million, its first growth in quarterly revenue in eight years.

In August 2013, Armstrong announced that Patch Media would scale back or sell hundreds of its local news sites. Not long afterward, layoffs began, with up to 500 out of 1,100 positions initially impacted. On January 15, 2014, Patch Media was spun off, and majority ownership was held by Hale Global. By the end of 2014, AOL controlled 0.74% of the global advertising market, well behind industry leader Google&#x27;s 31.4%.

On January 23, 2014, AOL acquired Gravity, a software startup that tracked users&#x27; online behavior and tailored ads and content based on their interests, for $83 million. The deal, which included approximately 40 Gravity employees and the company&#x27;s personalization technology, was Armstrong&#x27;s fourth-largest deal since taking command in 2009. Later that year, AOL acquired Vidible, a company that developed technology to help websites run video content from other publishers, and help video publishers sell their content to these websites. The deal, which was announced December 1, 2014, was reportedly worth roughly $50 million.

On July 16, 2014, AOL earned an Emmy nomination for the AOL original series &quot;The Future Starts Here&quot; in the News and Documentary category. This came days after AOL earned its first Primetime Emmy Award nomination and win for &quot;Park Bench with Steve Buscemi&quot; in the Outstanding Short Form Variety Series. Created and hosted by Tiffany Shlain, the series focused on humans&#x27; relationship with technology and featured episodes such as &quot;The Future of Our Species&quot;, &quot;Why We Love Robots&quot; and &quot;A Case for Optimism&quot;.

=== 2015–2021: division of Verizon ===

On May 12, 2015, Verizon announced plans to buy AOL for $50 per share in a deal valued at $4.4 billion. The transaction was completed on June 23. Armstrong, who continued to lead the firm following regulatory approval, called the deal the logical next step for AOL. &quot;If you look forward five years, you&#x27;re going to be in a space where there are going to be massive, global-scale networks, and there&#x27;s no better partner for us to go forward with than Verizon.&quot; he said. &quot;It&#x27;s really not about selling the company today. It&#x27;s about setting up for the next five to 10 years.&quot;

Analyst David Bank said he thought the deal made sense for Verizon. The deal will broaden Verizon&#x27;s advertising sales platforms and increase its video production ability through websites such as &quot;HuffPost&quot;, TechCrunch, and Engadget. However, Craig Moffett said it was unlikely the deal would make a big difference to Verizon&#x27;s bottom line. AOL had about two million dial-up subscribers at the time of the buyout. The announcement caused AOL&#x27;s stock price to rise 17%, while Verizon&#x27;s stock price dropped slightly.

Shortly before the Verizon purchase, on April 14, 2015, AOL launched ONE by AOL, a digital marketing programmatic platform that unifies buying channels and audience management platforms to track and optimize campaigns over multiple screens. Later that year, on September 15, AOL expanded the product with ONE by AOL: Creative, which is geared towards creative and media agencies to similarly connect marketing and ad distribution efforts.

On May 8, 2015, AOL reported its first-quarter revenue of $625.1 million, $483.5 million of which came from advertising and related operations, marking a 7% increase from Q1 2014. Over that year, the AOL Platforms division saw a 21% increase in revenue, but a drop in adjusted OIBDA due to increased investments in the company&#x27;s video and programmatic platforms.

On June 29, 2015, AOL announced a deal with Microsoft to take over the majority of its digital advertising business. Under the pact, as many as 1,200 Microsoft employees involved with the business will be transferred to AOL, and the company will take over the sale of display, video, and mobile ads on various Microsoft platforms in nine countries, including Brazil, Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Additionally, Google Search will be replaced on AOL properties with Bing—which will display advertising sold by Microsoft. Both advertising deals are subject to affiliate marketing revenue sharing.

On July 22, 2015, AOL received two News and Documentary Emmy nominations, one for MAKERS in the Outstanding Historical Programming category, and the other for &quot;True Trans With Laura Jane Grace&quot;, which documented the story of Laura Jane Grace, a transgender musician best known as the founder, lead singer, songwriter and guitarist of the punk rock band Against Me!, and her decision to come out publicly and overall transition experience.

On September 3, 2015, AOL agreed to buy Millennial Media for $238 million. On October 23, 2015, AOL completed the acquisition.

On October 1, 2015, Go90, a free ad-supported mobile video service aimed at young adult and teen viewers that Verizon owns and AOL oversees and operates, launched its content publicly after months of beta testing. The initial launch line-up included content from Comedy Central, HuffPost, Nerdist News, Univision News, Vice, ESPN and MTV.

On April 20, 2016, AOL acquired virtual reality studio RYOT to bring immersive 360 degree video and VR content to HuffPost&#x27;s global audience across desktop, mobile, and apps.

In July 2016, Verizon Communications announced its intent to purchase the core internet business of Yahoo!. Verizon merged AOL with Yahoo into a new company called &quot;Oath Inc.&quot;, which in January 2019 rebranded itself as Verizon Media.

In April 2018, Oath Inc. sold Moviefone to MoviePass Parent Helios and Matheson Analytics.

In November 2020 the &quot;Huffington Post&quot; was sold to BuzzFeed in a stock deal.

=== 2021–present: Apollo Global Management===
On May 3, 2021, Verizon announced it would sell 90 percent of its Verizon Media division to Apollo Global Management for $5 billion. The division became the second incarnation of Yahoo! Inc.

== Products and services ==

* Engadget
* Autoblog
* TechCrunch
* Built by Girls

AOL&#x27;s content contributors consists of over 20,000 bloggers, including politicians, celebrities, academics, and policy experts, who contribute on a wide range of topics making news.

In addition to mobile-optimized web experiences, AOL produces mobile applications for existing AOL properties like Autoblog, Engadget, The Huffington Post, TechCrunch, and products such as Alto, Pip, and Vivv.

=== Advertising ===
AOL has a global portfolio of media brands and advertising services across mobile, desktop, and TV. Services include brand integration and sponsorships through its in-house branded content arm, Partner Studio by AOL, as well as data and programmatic offerings through ad technology stack, ONE by AOL.

AOL acquired a number of businesses and technologies help to form ONE by AOL. These acquisitions included AdapTV in 2013 and Convertro, Precision Demand, and Vidible in 2014. ONE by AOL is further broken down into ONE by AOL for Publishers (formerly Vidible, AOL On Network and Be On for Publishers) and ONE by AOL for Advertisers, each of which have several sub-platforms.

On September 10, 2018, AOL&#x27;s parent company Oath consolidated BrightRoll, One by AOL and Yahoo Gemini to &#x27;simplify&#x27; adtech service by launching a single advertising proposition dubbed Oath Ad Platforms, now Yahoo! Ad Tech.

=== Membership ===
AOL offers a range of integrated products and properties including communication tools, mobile apps and services and subscription packages.

In 2017, before the discontinuation of AIM, &quot;billions of messages&quot; were sent &quot;daily&quot; on it and AOL&#x27;s other chat services.
* Dial-up Internet access – While 2.1 million people still used AOL&#x27;s dial-up service as recently as 2015, only a few thousand were still subscribed as of 2021.
* AOL Mail – AOL Mail is AOL&#x27;s proprietary email client. It is fully integrated with AIM and links to news headlines on AOL content sites.
* AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) – was AOL&#x27;s proprietary instant-messaging tool. It was released in 1997. It lost market share to competition in the instant messenger market such as Google Chat, Facebook Messenger, and Skype. It also included a video-chat service, AV by AIM. On December 15, 2017, AOL discontinued AIM.
* AOL Plans – AOL Plans offers three online safety and assistance tools: ID protection, data security and a general online technical assistance service.

=== AOL Desktop ===
AOL Desktop is an internet suite produced by AOL from 2007 that integrates a web browser, a media player and an instant messenger client. Version 10.X was based on AOL OpenRide, it is an upgrade from such. The macOS version is based on WebKit.

AOL Desktop version 10.X was different from previous AOL browsers and AOL Desktop versions. Its features are focused on web browsing as well as email. For instance, one does not have to sign into AOL in order to use it as a regular browser. In addition, non-AOL email accounts can be accessed through it. Primary buttons include &quot;MAIL&quot;, &quot;IM&quot;, and several shortcuts to various web pages. The first two require users to sign in, but the shortcuts to web pages can be used without authentication. AOL Desktop version 10.X was later marked as unsupported in favor of supporting the AOL Desktop 9.X versions.

Version 9.8 was released, replacing the Internet Explorer components of the web browser with CEF (Chromium Embedded Framework) to give users an improved web browsing experience closer to that of Chrome.

Version 11 of AOL Desktop was a total rewrite but maintained a similar user interface to the previous 9.8.X series of releases.

In 2017, a new paid version called AOL Desktop Gold was released, available for $4.99 per month after trial. It replaced the previous free version. After the shutdown of AIM in 2017, AOL&#x27;s original chat rooms continued to be accessible through AOL Desktop Gold, and some rooms remained active during peak hours. That chat system was shut down on December 15, 2020.

In addition to AOL Desktop, the company also offered a browser toolbar Mozilla plug-in, AOL Toolbar, for several web browsers that provided quick access to AOL services. The toolbar was available from 2007 until 2018.

== Criticism ==

In its earlier incarnation as a &quot;walled garden&quot; community and service provider, AOL received criticism for its community policies, terms of service, and customer service. Prior to 2006, AOL was known for its direct mailing of CD-ROMs and 3.5-inch floppy disks containing its software. The disks were distributed in large numbers; at one point, half of the CDs manufactured worldwide had AOL logos on them. The marketing tactic was criticized for its environmental cost, and AOL CDs were recognized as &quot;PC World&quot;″s most annoying tech product.

===Community leaders===
AOL used a system of volunteers to moderate its chat rooms, forums and user communities. The program dated back to AOL&#x27;s early days, when it charged by the hour for access and one of its highest billing services was chat. AOL provided free access to community leaders in exchange for moderating the chat rooms, and this effectively made chat very cheap to operate, and more lucrative than AOL&#x27;s other services of the era. There were 33,000 community leaders in 1996. All community leaders received hours of training and underwent a probationary period. While most community leaders moderated chat rooms, some ran AOL communities and controlled their layout and design, with as much as 90% of AOL&#x27;s content being created or overseen by community managers until 1996.

By 1996, ISPs were beginning to charge flat rates for unlimited access, which they could do at a profit because they only provided internet access. Even though AOL would lose money with such a pricing scheme, it was forced by market conditions to offer unlimited access in October 1996. In order to return to profitability, AOL rapidly shifted its focus from content creation to advertising, resulting in less of a need to carefully moderate every forum and chat room to keep users willing to pay by the minute to remain connected.

After unlimited access, AOL considered scrapping the program entirely, but continued it with a reduced number of community leaders, with scaled-back roles in creating content. Although community leaders continued to receive free access, after 1996 they were motivated more by the prestige of the position and the access to moderator tools and restricted areas within AOL. By 1999, there were over 15,000 volunteers in the program.

In May 1999, two former volunteers filed a class-action lawsuit alleging AOL violated the Fair Labor Standards Act by treating volunteers like employees. Volunteers had to apply for the position, commit to working for at least three to four hours a week, fill out timecards and sign a non-disclosure agreement. On July 22, AOL ended its youth corps, which consisted of 350 underage community leaders. At this time, the United States Department of Labor began an investigation into the program, but it came to no conclusions about AOL&#x27;s practices.

AOL ended its community leader program on June 8, 2005. The class action lawsuit dragged on for years, even after AOL ended the program and AOL declined as a major internet company. In 2010, AOL finally agreed to settle the lawsuit for $15 million. The community leader program was described as an example of co-production in a 2009 article in &quot;International Journal of Cultural Studies&quot;.

=== Billing disputes ===
AOL has faced a number of lawsuits over claims that it has been slow to stop billing customers after their accounts have been canceled, either by the company or the user. In addition, AOL changed its method of calculating used minutes in response to a class action lawsuit. Previously, AOL would add 15 seconds to the time a user was connected to the service and round up to the next whole minute (thus, a person who used the service for 12 minutes and 46 seconds would be charged for 14 minutes). AOL claimed this was to account for sign on/sign off time, but because this practice was not made known to its customers, the plaintiffs won (some also pointed out that signing on and off did not always take 15 seconds, especially when connecting via another ISP). AOL disclosed its connection-time calculation methods to all of its customers and credited them with extra free hours. In addition, the AOL software would notify the user of exactly how long they were connected and how many minutes they were being charged.

AOL was sued by the Ohio Attorney General in October 2003 for improper billing practices. The case was settled on June 8, 2005. AOL agreed to resolve any consumer complaints filed with the Ohio AG&#x27;s office. In December 2006, AOL agreed to provide restitution to Florida consumers to settle the case filed against them by the Florida Attorney General.

=== Account cancellation ===
Many customers complained that AOL personnel ignored their demands to cancel service and stop billing. In response to approximately 300 consumer complaints, the New York Attorney General&#x27;s office began an inquiry of AOL&#x27;s customer service policies. The investigation revealed that the company had an elaborate scheme for rewarding employees who purported to retain or &quot;save&quot; subscribers who had called to cancel their Internet service. In many instances, such retention was done against subscribers&#x27; wishes, or without their consent. Under the scheme, customer service personnel received bonuses worth tens of thousands of dollars if they could successfully dissuade or &quot;save&quot; half of the people who called to cancel service. For several years, AOL had instituted minimum retention or &quot;save&quot; percentages, which consumer representatives were expected to meet. These bonuses, and the minimum &quot;save&quot; rates accompanying them, had the effect of employees not honoring cancellations, or otherwise making cancellation unduly difficult for consumers.

On August 24, 2005, America Online agreed to pay $1.25 million to the state of New York and reformed its customer service procedures. Under the agreement, AOL would no longer require its customer service representatives to meet a minimum quota for customer retention in order to receive a bonus. However the agreement only covered people in the state of New York.

On June 13, 2006, Vincent Ferrari documented his account cancellation phone call in a blog post, stating he had switched to broadband years earlier. In the recorded phone call, the AOL representative refused to cancel the account unless the 30-year-old Ferrari explained why AOL hours were still being recorded on it. Ferrari insisted that AOL software was not even installed on the computer. When Ferrari demanded that the account be canceled regardless, the AOL representative asked to speak with Ferrari&#x27;s father, for whom the account had been set up. The conversation was aired on CNBC. When CNBC reporters tried to have an account on AOL cancelled, they were hung up on immediately and it ultimately took more than 45 minutes to cancel the account.

On July 19, 2006, AOL&#x27;s entire retention manual was released on the Internet. On August 3, 2006, Time Warner announced that the company would be dissolving AOL&#x27;s retention centers due to its profits hinging on $1 billion in cost cuts. The company estimated that it would lose more than six million subscribers over the following year.

=== Direct marketing of disks ===
Prior to 2006, AOL often sent unsolicited mass direct mail of 3&quot; floppy disks and CD-ROMs containing their software. They were the most frequent user of this marketing tactic, and received criticism for the environmental cost of the campaign. According to &quot;PC World&quot;, in the 1990s &quot;you couldn&#x27;t open a magazine (&quot;PC World&quot; included) or your mailbox without an AOL disk falling out of it&quot;.

The mass distribution of these disks was seen as wasteful by the public and led to protest groups. One such was No More AOL CDs, a web-based effort by two IT workers to collect one million disks with the intent to return the disks to AOL. The website was started in August 2001, and an estimated 410,176 CDs were collected by August 2007 when the project was shut down.

=== Software ===
In 2000, AOL was served with an $8 billion lawsuit alleging that its AOL 5.0 software caused significant difficulties for users attempting to use third-party Internet service providers. The lawsuit sought damages of up to $1000 for each user that had downloaded the software cited at the time of the lawsuit. AOL later agreed to a settlement of $15 million, without admission of wrongdoing. The AOL software then was given a feature called AOL Dialer, or AOL Connect on . This feature allowed users to connect to the ISP without running the full interface. This allowed users to use only the applications they wish to use, especially if they do not favor the AOL Browser.

AOL 9.0 was once identified by Stopbadware as being &quot;under investigation&quot; for installing additional software without disclosure, and modifying browser preferences, toolbars, and icons. However, as of the release of AOL 9.0 VR (Vista Ready) on January 26, 2007, it was no longer considered badware due to changes AOL made in the software.

=== Usenet newsgroups ===
When AOL gave clients access to Usenet in 1993, they hid at least one newsgroup in standard list view: &quot;alt.aol-sucks&quot;. AOL did list the newsgroup in the alternative description view, but changed the description to &quot;Flames and complaints about America Online&quot;. With AOL clients swarming Usenet newsgroups, the old, existing user base started to develop a strong distaste for both AOL and its clients, referring to the new state of affairs as Eternal September.

AOL discontinued access to Usenet on June 25, 2005. No official details were provided as to the cause of decommissioning Usenet access, except providing users the suggestion to access Usenet services from a third-party, Google Groups. AOL then provided community-based message boards in lieu of Usenet.

=== Terms of Service (TOS) ===
AOL has a detailed set of guidelines and expectations for users on their service, known as the Terms of Service (TOS, also known as Conditions of Service (COS) in the UK). It is separated into three different sections: &quot;Member Agreement&quot;, &quot;Community Guidelines&quot; and &quot;Privacy Policy&quot;. All three agreements are presented to users at time of registration and digital acceptance is achieved when they access the AOL service. During the period when volunteer chat room hosts and board monitors were used, chat room hosts were given a brief online training session and test on Terms of Service violations.

There have been many complaints over rules that govern an AOL user&#x27;s conduct. Some users disagree with the TOS, citing the guidelines are too strict to follow coupled with the fact the TOS may change without users being made aware. A considerable cause for this was likely due to alleged censorship of user-generated content during the earlier years of growth for AOL.

=== Certified email ===
In early 2005, AOL stated its intention to implement a certified email system called Goodmail, which will allow companies to send email to users with whom they have pre-existing business relationships, with a visual indication that the email is from a trusted source and without the risk that the email messages might be blocked or stripped by spam filters.

This decision drew fire from MoveOn, which characterized the program as an &quot;email tax&quot;, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), which characterized it as a shakedown of non-profits. A website called Dearaol.com was launched, with an online petition and a blog that garnered hundreds of signatures from people and organizations expressing their opposition to AOL&#x27;s use of Goodmail.

Esther Dyson defended the move in an editorial in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, saying &quot;I hope Goodmail succeeds, and that it has lots of competition. I also think it and its competitors will eventually transform into services that more directly serve the interests of mail recipients. Instead of the fees going to Goodmail and AOL, they will also be shared with the individual recipients.&quot;

Tim Lee of the Technology Liberation Front posted an article that questioned the Electronic Frontier Foundation&#x27;s adopting a confrontational posture when dealing with private companies. Lee&#x27;s article cited a series of discussions on Declan McCullagh&#x27;s Politechbot mailing list on this subject between the EFF&#x27;s Danny O&#x27;Brien and antispammer Suresh Ramasubramanian, who has also compared the EFF&#x27;s tactics in opposing Goodmail to tactics used by Republican political strategist Karl Rove. SpamAssassin developer Justin Mason posted some criticism of the EFF&#x27;s and Moveon&#x27;s &quot;going overboard&quot; in their opposition to the scheme.

The dearaol.com campaign lost momentum and disappeared, with the last post to the now defunct dearaol.com blog—&quot;AOL starts the shakedown&quot; being made on May 9, 2006.

Comcast, who also used the service, announced on its website that Goodmail had ceased operations and as of February 4, 2011, they no longer used the service.

=== Search data ===

On August 4, 2006, AOL released a compressed text file on one of its websites containing 20 million search keywords for over 650,000 users over a three-month period between March 1 and May 31, 2006, intended for research purposes. AOL pulled the file from public access by August 7, but not before its wide distribution on the Internet by others. Derivative research, titled &quot;A Picture of Search&quot; was published by authors Pass, Chowdhury and Torgeson for The First International Conference on Scalable Information Systems.

The data were used by websites such as AOLstalker for entertainment purposes, where users of AOLstalker are encouraged to judge AOL clients based on the humorousness of personal details revealed by search behavior.

=== User list exposure ===
In 2003, Jason Smathers, an AOL employee, was convicted of stealing America Online&#x27;s 92 million screen names and selling them to a known spammer. Smathers pled guilty to conspiracy charges in 2005. Smathers pled guilty to violations of the US CAN-SPAM Act of 2003. He was sentenced in August 2005 to 15 months in prison; the sentencing judge also recommended Smathers be forced to pay $84,000 in restitution, triple the $28,000 that he sold the addresses for.

=== AOL&#x27;s Computer Checkup &quot;scareware&quot; ===
On February 27, 2012, a class action lawsuit was filed against Support.com, Inc. and partner AOL, Inc. The lawsuit alleged Support.com and AOL&#x27;s Computer Checkup &quot;scareware&quot; (which uses software developed by Support.com) misrepresented that their software programs would identify and resolve a host of technical problems with computers, offered to perform a free &quot;scan&quot;, which often found problems with users&#x27; computers. The companies then offered to sell software—for which AOL allegedly charged $4.99 a month and Support.com $29—to remedy those problems. Both AOL, Inc. and Support.com, Inc. settled on May 30, 2013, for $8.5 million. This included $25.00 to each valid class member and $100,000 each to Consumer Watchdog and the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley wrote: &quot;Distributing a portion of the [funds] to Consumer Watchdog will meet the interests of the silent class members because the organization will use the funds to help protect consumers across the nation from being subject to the types of fraudulent and misleading conduct that is alleged here,&quot; and &quot;EFF&#x27;s mission includes a strong consumer protection component, especially in regards to online protection.&quot;

AOL continues to market Computer Checkup.

=== NSA PRISM program ===
Following media reports about PRISM, NSA&#x27;s massive electronic surveillance program, in June 2013, several technology companies were identified as participants, including AOL. According to leaks of said program, AOL joined the PRISM program in 2011.

=== Hosting of user profiles changed, then discontinued ===
At one time, most AOL users had an online &quot;profile&quot; hosted by the AOL Hometown service. When AOL Hometown was discontinued, users had to create a new profile on Bebo. This was an unsuccessful attempt to create a social network that would compete with Facebook. When the value of Bebo decreased to a tiny fraction of the $850 million AOL paid for it, users were forced to recreate their profiles yet again, on a new service called AOL Lifestream.

AOL decided to shut down Lifestream on February 24, 2017, and gave users one month&#x27;s notice to save photos and videos that had been uploaded to Lifestream. Following the shutdown, AOL no longer provides any option for hosting user profiles.

During the Hometown/Bebo/Lifestream era, another user&#x27;s profile could be displayed by clicking the &quot;Buddy Info&quot; button in the AOL Desktop software. After the shutdown of Lifestream, this was no longer supported, but opened to the AIM home page (www.aim.com), which also became defunct, redirecting to AOL&#x27;s home page.

<text>The terms  (AD) and before Christ (BC) are used when designating years in the Gregorian and Julian calendars. The term is Medieval Latin and means &quot;in the year of the Lord&quot; but is often presented using &quot;our Lord&quot; instead of &quot;the Lord&quot;, taken from the full original phrase &quot;&quot;, which translates to &quot;in the year of our Lord Jesus Christ&quot;. The form &quot;BC&quot; is specific to English, and equivalent abbreviations are used in other languages: the Latin form, rarely used in English, is (ACN) or (AC).

This calendar era takes as its epoch the traditionally reckoned year of the conception or birth of Jesus. Years &quot;AD&quot; are counted forward since that epoch and years &quot;BC&quot; are counted backward from the epoch. There is no year zero in this scheme; thus the year AD 1 immediately follows the year 1 BC. This dating system was devised in 525 by Dionysius Exiguus but was not widely used until the 9th century. (Modern scholars believe that the actual date of birth of Jesus was about 5 BC.)

Terminology that is viewed by some as being more neutral and inclusive of non-Christian people is to call this the Common Era (abbreviated as CE), with the preceding years referred to as Before the Common Era (BCE). Astronomical year numbering and ISO 8601 do not use words or abbreviations related to Christianity, but use the same numbers for AD years (but not for BC years since the astronomical year 0 is 1 BC).

==Usage==
Traditionally, English follows Latin usage by placing the &quot;AD&quot; abbreviation before the year number, though it is also found after the year. In contrast, &quot;BC&quot; is always placed after the year number (for example: 70 BC but AD 70), which preserves syntactic order. The abbreviation &quot;AD&quot; is also widely used after the number of a century or millennium, as in &quot;fourth century AD&quot; or &quot;second millennium AD&quot; (although conservative usage formerly rejected such expressions). Since &quot;BC&quot; is the English abbreviation for &quot;Before Christ&quot;, it is sometimes incorrectly concluded that AD means &quot;After Death&quot; (i.e., after the death of Jesus), which would mean that the approximately 33 years commonly associated with the life of Jesus would be included in neither the BC nor the AD time scales.

== History ==
The &quot;anno Domini&quot; dating system was devised in 525 by Dionysius Exiguus to enumerate years in his Easter table. His system was to replace the Diocletian era that had been used in older Easter tables, as he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians. The last year of the old table, Diocletian Anno Martyrium 247, was immediately followed by the first year of his table, anno Domini 532. When Dionysius devised his table, Julian calendar years were identified by naming the consuls who held office that year— Dionysius himself stated that the &quot;present year&quot; was &quot;the consulship of Probus Junior&quot;, which was 525 years &quot;since the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ&quot;. Thus, Dionysius implied that Jesus&#x27; incarnation occurred 525 years earlier, without stating the specific year during which his birth or conception occurred. &quot;However, nowhere in his exposition of his table does Dionysius relate his epoch to any other dating system, whether consulate, Olympiad, year of the world, or regnal year of Augustus; much less does he explain or justify the underlying date.&quot;

Bonnie J. Blackburn and Leofranc Holford-Strevens briefly present arguments for 2 BC, 1 BC, or AD 1 as the year Dionysius intended for the Nativity or incarnation. Among the sources of confusion are:
* In modern times, incarnation is synonymous with the conception, but some ancient writers, such as Bede, considered incarnation to be synonymous with the Nativity.
* The civil or consular year began on 1 January, but the Diocletian year began on 29 August (30 August in the year before a Julian leap year).
* There were inaccuracies in the lists of consuls.
* There were confused summations of emperors&#x27; regnal years.

It is not known how Dionysius established the year of Jesus&#x27;s birth. One major theory is that Dionysius based his calculation on the Gospel of Luke, which states that Jesus was &quot;about thirty years old&quot; shortly after &quot;the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar&quot;, and hence subtracted thirty years from that date, or that Dionysius counted back 532 years from the first year of his new table. This method was probably the one used by ancient historians such as Tertullian, Eusebius or Epiphanius, all of whom agree that Jesus was born in 2 BC, probably following this statement of Jesus&#x27; age (i.e. subtracting thirty years from AD 29). Alternatively, Dionysius may have used an earlier unknown source. The Chronograph of 354 states that Jesus was born during the consulship of Caesar and Paullus (AD 1), but the logic behind this is also unknown.

It has also been speculated by Georges Declercq that Dionysius&#x27; desire to replace Diocletian years with a calendar based on the incarnation of Christ was intended to prevent people from believing the imminent end of the world. At the time, it was believed by some that the resurrection of the dead and end of the world would occur 500 years after the birth of Jesus. The old &quot;Anno Mundi&quot; calendar theoretically commenced with the creation of the world based on information in the Old Testament. It was believed that, based on the &quot;Anno Mundi&quot; calendar, Jesus was born in the year 5500 (5500 years after the world was created) with the year 6000 of the &quot;Anno Mundi&quot; calendar marking the end of the world. &quot;Anno Mundi&quot; 6000 (approximately AD 500) was thus equated with the end of the world but this date had already passed in the time of Dionysius.
The &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; attributed to Nennius written in the 9th century makes extensive use of the Anno Passionis (AP) dating system which was in common use as well as the newer AD dating system. The AP dating system took its start from &#x27;The Year of The Passion&#x27;. It is generally accepted by experts there is a 27-year difference between AP and AD reference.

The date of birth of Jesus of Nazareth is not stated in the gospels or in any secular text, but most scholars assume a date of birth between 6 BC and 4 BC. The historical evidence is too fragmentary to allow a definitive dating, but the date is estimated through two different approaches—one by analyzing references to known historical events mentioned in the Nativity accounts in the Gospels of Luke and Matthew and the second by working backwards from the estimation of the start of the ministry of Jesus.

=== Popularization ===
The Anglo-Saxon historian Bede, who was familiar with the work of Dionysius Exiguus, used &quot;anno Domini&quot; dating in his &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;, which he completed in AD 731. In the &quot;History&quot; he also used the Latin phrase &quot;ante [...] incarnationis dominicae tempus anno sexagesimo&quot; (&quot;in the sixtieth year before the time of the Lord&#x27;s incarnation&quot;), which is equivalent to the English &quot;before Christ&quot;, to identify years before the first year of this era. Both Dionysius and Bede regarded &quot;anno Domini&quot; as beginning at the incarnation of Jesus Christ, but &quot;the distinction between Incarnation and Nativity was not drawn until the late 9th century, when in some places the Incarnation epoch was identified with Christ&#x27;s conception, i. e., the Annunciation on March 25&quot; (&quot;Annunciation style&quot; dating).
On the continent of Europe, &quot;anno Domini&quot; was introduced as the era of choice of the Carolingian Renaissance by the English cleric and scholar Alcuin in the late eighth century. Its endorsement by Emperor Charlemagne and his successors popularizing the use of the epoch and spreading it throughout the Carolingian Empire ultimately lies at the core of the system&#x27;s prevalence. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, popes continued to date documents according to regnal years for some time, but usage of AD gradually became more common in Catholic countries from the 11th to the 14th centuries. In 1422, Portugal became the last Western European country to switch to the system begun by Dionysius. Eastern Orthodox countries only began to adopt AD instead of the Byzantine calendar in 1700 when Russia did so, with others adopting it in the 19th and 20th centuries.

Although &quot;anno Domini&quot; was in widespread use by the 9th century, the term &quot;Before Christ&quot; (or its equivalent) did not become common until much later. Bede used the expression &quot;anno [...] ante incarnationem Dominicam&quot; (in the year before the incarnation of the Lord) twice. &quot;Anno ante Christi nativitatem&quot; (in the year before the birth of Christ) is found in 1474 in a work by a German monk. In 1627, the French Jesuit theologian Denis Pétau (Dionysius Petavius in Latin), with his work &quot;De doctrina temporum&quot;, popularized the usage &quot;ante Christum&quot; (Latin for &quot;Before Christ&quot;) to mark years prior to AD.

===New year===
When the reckoning from Jesus&#x27; incarnation began replacing the previous dating systems in western Europe, various people chose different Christian feast days to begin the year: Christmas, Annunciation, or Easter. Thus, depending on the time and place, the year number changed on different days in the year, which created slightly different styles in chronology:
* From 25 March 753 AUC (1 BC), i.e., notionally from the incarnation of Jesus. That first &quot;Annunciation style&quot; appeared in Arles at the end of the 9th century then spread to Burgundy and northern Italy. It was not commonly used and was called &quot;calculus pisanus&quot; since it was adopted in Pisa and survived there until 1750.
* From 25 December 753 AUC (1 BC), i.e., notionally from the birth of Jesus. It was called &quot;Nativity style&quot; and had been spread by Bede together with the &quot;anno Domini&quot; in the early Middle Ages. That reckoning of the Year of Grace from Christmas was used in France, England and most of western Europe (except Spain) until the 12th century (when it was replaced by Annunciation style) and in Germany until the second quarter of the 13th century.
* From 25 March 754 AUC (AD 1). That second &quot;Annunciation style&quot; may have originated in Fleury Abbey in the early 11th century, but it was spread by the Cistercians. Florence adopted that style in opposition to that of Pisa, so it got the name of &quot;calculus florentinus&quot;. It soon spread in France and also in England where it became common in the late 12th century and lasted until 1752.
* From Easter. That &quot;mos gallicanus&quot; (French custom) bound to a moveable feast was introduced in France by king Philip Augustus (r. 1180–1223), maybe to establish a new style in the provinces reconquered from England. However, it never spread beyond the ruling élite.
With these various styles, the same day could, in some cases, be dated in 1099, 1100 or 1101.

==Other Christian and European eras==

During the first six centuries of what would come to be known as the Christian era, European countries used various systems to count years. Systems in use included consular dating, imperial regnal year dating, and Creation dating.

Although the last non-imperial consul, Basilius, was appointed in 541 by Emperor Justinian I, later emperors through to Constans II (641–668) were appointed consuls on the first of January after their accession. All of these emperors, except Justinian, used imperial post-consular years for the years of their reign, along with their regnal years. Long unused, this practice was not formally abolished until Novell XCIV of the law code of Leo VI did so in 888.

Another calculation had been developed by the Alexandrian monk Annianus around the year AD 400, placing the Annunciation on 25 March AD 9 (Julian)—eight to ten years after the date that Dionysius was to imply. Although this incarnation was popular during the early centuries of the Byzantine Empire, years numbered from it, an &quot;Era of Incarnation&quot;, were exclusively used and are still used in Ethiopia. This accounts for the seven- or eight-year discrepancy between the Gregorian and Ethiopian calendars.

Byzantine chroniclers like Maximus the Confessor, George Syncellus, and Theophanes dated their years from Annianus&#x27; creation of the world. This era, called &quot;Anno Mundi&quot;, &quot;year of the world&quot; (abbreviated AM), by modern scholars, began its first year on 25 March 5492 BC. Later Byzantine chroniclers used &quot;Anno Mundi&quot; years from 1 September 5509 BC, the Byzantine Era. No single &quot;Anno Mundi&quot; epoch was dominant throughout the Christian world. Eusebius of Caesarea in his &quot;Chronicle&quot; used an era beginning with the birth of Abraham, dated in 2016 BC (AD 1 = 2017 Anno Abrahami).

Spain and Portugal continued to date by the Spanish Era (also called Era of the Caesars), which began counting from 38 BC, well into the Middle Ages. In 1422, Portugal became the last Catholic country to adopt the &quot;anno Domini&quot; system.

The Era of Martyrs, which numbered years from the accession of Diocletian in 284, who launched the most severe persecution of Christians, was used by the Church of Alexandria and is still officially used by the Coptic Orthodox and Coptic Catholic churches. It was also used by the Ethiopian and Eritrean churches. Another system was to date from the crucifixion of Jesus, which as early as Hippolytus and Tertullian was believed to have occurred in the consulate of the Gemini (AD 29), which appears in some medieval manuscripts.

== CE and BCE ==
Alternative names for the &quot;anno Domini&quot; era include &quot;vulgaris aerae&quot; (found 1615 in Latin),
&quot;Vulgar Era&quot; (in English, as early as 1635),
&quot;Christian Era&quot; (in English, in 1652),
&quot;Common Era&quot; (in English, 1708),
and &quot;Current Era&quot;.
Since 1856, the alternative abbreviations CE and BCE (sometimes written C.E. and B.C.E.) are sometimes used in place of AD and BC.

The &quot;Common/Current Era&quot; (&quot;CE&quot;) terminology is often preferred by those who desire a term that does not explicitly make religious references but still uses the same epoch as the &quot;anno Domini&quot; notation.
For example, Cunningham and Starr (1998) write that &quot;B.C.E./C.E. […] do not presuppose faith in Christ and hence are more appropriate for interfaith dialog than the conventional B.C./A.D.&quot; Upon its foundation, the Republic of China adopted the Minguo Era but used the Western calendar for international purposes. The translated term was (). Later, in 1949, the People&#x27;s Republic of China adopted () for all purposes domestic and foreign.

== No year zero: start and end of a century ==
In the AD year numbering system, whether applied to the Julian or Gregorian calendars, AD 1 is immediately preceded by 1 BC, with nothing in between them (there was no year zero). There are debates as to whether a new decade, century, or millennium begins on a year ending in zero or one.

For computational reasons, astronomical year numbering and the ISO 8601 standard designate years so that AD 1 = year 1, 1 BC = year 0, 2 BC = year −1, etc. In common usage, ancient dates are expressed in the Julian calendar, but ISO 8601 uses the Gregorian calendar and astronomers may use a variety of time scales depending on the application. Thus dates using the year 0 or negative years may require further investigation before being converted to BC or AD.

<doc id="1408" wikidata="Q154332" url="?curid=1408" title="Alcuin">
<text>Alcuin of York (; ; 735 – 19 May 804) – also called Ealhwine, Alhwin, or Alchoin – was a scholar, clergyman, poet, and teacher from York, Northumbria. He was born around 735 and became the student of Archbishop Ecgbert at York. At the invitation of Charlemagne, he became a leading scholar and teacher at the Carolingian court, where he remained a figure in the 780s and 790s. Before that, he was also a court chancellor in Aachen. &quot;The most learned man anywhere to be found&quot;, according to Einhard&#x27;s &quot;Life of Charlemagne&quot; (–833), he is considered among the most important intellectual architects of the Carolingian Renaissance. Among his pupils were many of the dominant intellectuals of the Carolingian era.

Alcuin wrote many theological and dogmatic treatises, as well as a few grammatical works and a number of poems. In 796, he was made abbot of Marmoutier Abbey, in Tours, where he worked on perfecting the Carolingian minuscule script. He remained there until his death.

== Biography ==
=== Background ===
Alcuin was born in Northumbria, presumably sometime in the 730s. Virtually nothing is known of his parents, family background, or origin. In common hagiographical fashion, the &quot;Vita Alcuini&quot; asserts that Alcuin was of &quot;noble English stock&quot;, and this statement has usually been accepted by scholars. Alcuin&#x27;s own work only mentions such collateral kinsmen as Wilgils of Ripon, father of the missionary saint Willibrord; and Beornrad (also spelled Beornred), abbot of Echternach and bishop of Sens. Willibrord, Alcuin and Beornrad were all related by blood.

In his &quot;Life&quot; of St Willibrord, Alcuin writes that Wilgils called a &quot;Pater familias&quot;, had founded an oratory and church at the mouth of the Humber, which had fallen into Alcuin&#x27;s possession by inheritance. Because in early Anglo-Latin writing &quot;paterfamilias&quot; (&quot;head of a family, householder&quot;) usually referred to a (&quot;churl&quot;), Donald A. Bullough suggests that Alcuin&#x27;s family was of (&quot;churlish&quot;) status: i.e., free but subordinate to a noble lord, and that Alcuin and other members of his family rose to prominence through beneficial connections with the aristocracy. If so, Alcuin&#x27;s origins may lie in the southern part of what was formerly known as Deira.

=== York ===
The young Alcuin came to the cathedral church of York during the golden age of Archbishop Ecgbert and his brother, the Northumbrian King Eadberht. Ecgbert had been a disciple of the Venerable Bede, who urged him to raise York to an archbishopric. King Eadberht and Archbishop Ecgbert oversaw the re-energising and reorganisation of the English church, with an emphasis on reforming the clergy and on the tradition of learning that Bede had begun. Ecgbert was devoted to Alcuin, who thrived under his tutelage.

The York school was renowned as a centre of learning in the liberal arts, literature, and science, as well as in religious matters. From here, Alcuin drew inspiration for the school he would lead at the Frankish court. He revived the school with the trivium and quadrivium disciplines, writing a codex on the trivium, while his student Hrabanus wrote one on the quadrivium.

Alcuin graduated to become a teacher during the 750s. His ascendancy to the headship of the York school, the ancestor of St Peter&#x27;s School, began after Æthelbert of York became Archbishop of York in 767. Around the same time, Alcuin became a deacon in the church. He was never ordained a priest. Though no real evidence shows that he took monastic vows, he lived as if he had.

In 781, King Ælfwald I of Northumbria sent Alcuin to Rome to petition the Pope for official confirmation of York&#x27;s status as an archbishopric and to confirm the election of the new archbishop, Eanbald I. On his way home, he met Charlemagne (whom he had met once before), this time in the Italian city of Parma.

=== Charlemagne ===
Alcuin&#x27;s intellectual curiosity allowed him to be reluctantly persuaded to join Charlemagne&#x27;s court. He joined an illustrious group of scholars whom Charlemagne had gathered around him, the mainsprings of the Carolingian Renaissance: Peter of Pisa, Paulinus II of Aquileia, Rado, and Abbot Saint Fulrad. Alcuin would later write, &quot;the Lord was calling me to the service of King Charles&quot;.

Alcuin became master of the Palace School of Charlemagne in Aachen () in 782. It had been founded by the king&#x27;s ancestors as a place for the education of the royal children (mostly in manners and the ways of the court). However, Charlemagne wanted to include the liberal arts, and most importantly, the study of religion. From 782 to 790, Alcuin taught Charlemagne himself, his sons Pepin and Louis, as well as young men sent to be educated at court, and the young clerics attached to the palace chapel. Bringing with him from York his assistants Pyttel, Sigewulf, and Joseph, Alcuin revolutionised the educational standards of the Palace School, introducing Charlemagne to the liberal arts and creating a personalised atmosphere of scholarship and learning, to the extent that the institution came to be known as the &quot;school of Master Albinus&quot;.

In this role as adviser, he took issue with the emperor&#x27;s policy of forcing pagans to be baptised on pain of death, arguing, &quot;Faith is a free act of the will, not a forced act. We must appeal to the conscience, not compel it by violence. You can force people to be baptised, but you cannot force them to believe&quot;. His arguments seem to have prevailed – Charlemagne abolished the death penalty for paganism in 797.

Charlemagne gathered the best men of every land in his court and became far more than just the king at the centre. It seems that he made many of these men his closest friends and counsellors. They referred to him as &quot;David&quot;, a reference to the Biblical king David. Alcuin soon found himself on intimate terms with Charlemagne and the other men at court, where pupils and masters were known by affectionate and jesting nicknames. Alcuin himself was known as &#x27;Albinus&#x27; or &#x27;Flaccus&#x27;. While at Aachen, Alcuin bestowed pet names upon his pupils – derived mainly from Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Eclogues&quot;. According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, &quot;He loved Charlemagne and enjoyed the king&#x27;s esteem, but his letters reveal that his fear of him was as great as his love.&quot;

After the death of Pope Adrian I, Alcuin was commissioned by Charlemagne to compose an epitaph for Adrian. The epitaph was inscribed on black stone quarried at Aachen and carried to Rome where it was set over Adrian&#x27;s tomb in the south transept of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica just before Charlemagne&#x27;s coronation in the basilica on Christmas Day 800.

=== Return to Northumbria and back to Francia ===
In 790, Alcuin returned from the court of Charlemagne to England, to which he had remained attached. He dwelt there for some time, but Charlemagne then invited him back to help in the fight against the Adoptionist heresy, which was at that time making great progress in Toledo, the old capital of the Visigoths and still a major city for the Christians under Islamic rule in Spain. He is believed to have had contacts with Beatus of Liébana, from the Kingdom of Asturias, who fought against Adoptionism. At the Council of Frankfurt in 794, Alcuin upheld the orthodox doctrine against the views expressed by Felix of Urgel, an heresiarch according to the Catholic Encyclopedia. Having failed during his stay in Northumbria to influence King Æthelred I in the conduct of his reign, Alcuin never returned home.

He was back at Charlemagne&#x27;s court by at least mid-792, writing a series of letters to Æthelred, to Hygbald, Bishop of Lindisfarne, and to Æthelhard, Archbishop of Canterbury in the succeeding months, dealing with the Viking attack on Lindisfarne in July 793. These letters and Alcuin&#x27;s poem on the subject, , provide the only significant contemporary account of these events. In his description of the Viking attack, he wrote: &quot;Never before has such terror appeared in Britain. Behold the church of St Cuthbert, splattered with the blood of God&#x27;s priests, robbed of its ornaments.&quot;

=== Tours and death ===
In 796, Alcuin was in his 60s. He hoped to be free from court duties and upon the death of Abbot Itherius of Saint Martin at Tours, Charlemagne put Marmoutier Abbey into Alcuin&#x27;s care, with the understanding that he should be available if the king ever needed his counsel. There, he encouraged the work of the monks on the beautiful Carolingian minuscule script, ancestor of modern Roman typefaces using a mixture of upper- and lower-case letters. Latin paleography in the 8th century leaves little room for a single origin of the script, and sources contradict his importance as no proof has been found of his direct involvement in the creation of the script. Carolingian minuscule was already in use before Alcuin arrived in Francia. Most likely he was responsible for copying and preserving the script while at the same time restoring the purity of the form.

Alcuin died on 19 May 804, some 10 years before the emperor, and was buried at St. Martin&#x27;s Church under an epitaph that partly read:
The majority of details on Alcuin&#x27;s life come from his letters and poems. Also, autobiographical sections are in Alcuin&#x27;s poem on York and in the &quot;Vita Alcuini&quot;, a hagiography written for him at Ferrières in the 820s, possibly based in part on the memories of Sigwulf, one of Alcuin&#x27;s pupils.

== Carolingian Renaissance figure and legacy ==
=== Mathematician ===
The collection of mathematical and logical word problems entitled &quot;Propositiones ad acuendos juvenes&quot; (&quot;Problems to Sharpen Youths&quot;) is sometimes attributed to Alcuin. In a 799 letter to Charlemagne, the scholar claimed to have sent &quot;certain figures of arithmetic for the joy of cleverness&quot;, which some scholars have identified with the &quot;Propositiones&quot;.

The text contains about 53 mathematical word problems (with solutions), in no particular pedagogical order. Among the most famous of these problems are: four that involve river crossings, including the problem of three anxious brothers, each of whom has an unmarried sister whom he cannot leave alone with either of the other men lest she be defiled (Problem 17); the problem of the wolf, goat, and cabbage (Problem 18); and the problem of &quot;the two adults and two children where the children weigh half as much as the adults&quot; (Problem 19). Alcuin&#x27;s sequence is the solution to one of the problems of that book.

=== Literary influence ===
Alcuin made the abbey school into a model of excellence and many students flocked to it. He had many manuscripts copied using outstandingly beautiful calligraphy, the Carolingian minuscule based on round and legible uncial letters. He wrote many letters to his English friends, to Arno, bishop of Salzburg and above all to Charlemagne. These letters (of which 311 are extant) are filled mainly with pious meditations, but they form an important source of information as to the literary and social conditions of the time and are the most reliable authority for the history of humanism during the Carolingian age. Alcuin trained the numerous monks of the abbey in piety, and in the midst of these pursuits, he died.

Alcuin is the most prominent figure of the Carolingian Renaissance, in which three main periods have been distinguished: in the first of these, up to the arrival of Alcuin at the court, the Italians occupy a central place; in the second, Alcuin and the English are dominant; in the third (from 804), the influence of Theodulf of Orléans is preponderant.

Alcuin also developed manuals used in his educational work – a grammar and works on rhetoric and dialectics. These are written in the form of a dialogue, and in two of them the interlocutors are Charlemagne and Alcuin. He wrote several theological treatises: a &quot;De fide Trinitatis&quot;, and commentaries on the Bible. Alcuin is credited with inventing the first known question mark, though it did not resemble the modern symbol.

Alcuin transmitted to the Franks the knowledge of Latin culture, which had existed in Anglo-Saxon England. A number of his works still exist. Besides some graceful epistles in the style of Venantius Fortunatus, he wrote some long poems, and notably he is the author of a history (in verse) of the church at York, &quot;Versus de patribus, regibus et sanctis Eboracensis ecclesiae&quot;. At the same time, he is noted for making one of the only explicit comments on Old English poetry surviving from the early Middle Ages, in a letter to one Speratus, the bishop of an unnamed English see (possibly Unwona of Leicester): (&quot;Let God&#x27;s words be read at the episcopal dinner-table. It is right that a reader should be heard, not a harpist, patristic discourse, not pagan song. What has Ingeld to do with Christ?&quot;).

== Legacy ==
Alcuin is honoured in the Church of England and in the Episcopal Church on 20 May the first available day after the day of his death (as Dunstan is celebrated on 19 May).

Alcuin is also venerated as a Saint by Eastern Orthodox Christians in the British Isles and Ireland. The Orthodox Fellowship of John the Baptist publishes a liturgical calendar that is widely used in that region, and this calendar includes a feast for St Alcuin.

Alcuin College, one of the colleges of the University of York, is named after him. In January 2020, Alcuin was the subject of the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;In Our Time&quot;. In December 2024, Alcuin was prominently featured in a Part 2 of a 3-part podcast series on Charlemagne in &quot;The Rest Is History (podcast)&quot;.

<text>Angilbert, Count of Ponthieu ( – 18 February 814) was a noble Frankish poet who was educated under Alcuin and served Charlemagne as a secretary, diplomat, and son-in-law. He is venerated as a pre-Congregation saint and is still honored on the day of his death, 18 February.

==Life==
Angilbert seems to have been brought up at the court of Charlemagne at the palace school in Aquae Granni (Aachen). He was educated there as the pupil and then-friend of the great English scholar Alcuin. When Charlemagne sent his young son Pepin to Italy as King of the Lombards, Angilbert went along as &quot;primicerius palatii&quot;, a high administrator of the satellite court. As the friend and adviser of Pepin, he assisted for a while in the government of Italy. Angilbert delivered the document on Iconoclasm from the Frankish Synod of Frankfurt to Pope Adrian I, and was later sent on three important embassies to the pope, in 792, 794, and 796. At one time, he served an officer of the maritime provinces. He accompanied Charlemagne to Rome in 800 and was one of the witnesses to his will in 811.

There are various traditions concerning Angilbert&#x27;s relationship with Bertha, daughter of Charlemagne. One holds that they were married, another that they were not. They had, however, at least one daughter and two sons, one of whom, Nithard, became a notable figure in the mid-9th century, while their daughter Bertha went on to marry Helgaud II, Count of Ponthieu. Control of marriage and the meanings of legitimacy were hotly contested in the Middle Ages. Bertha and Angilbert are an example of how resistance to the idea of a sacramental marriage could coincide with holding church offices. On the other hand, some historians have speculated that Charlemagne opposed formal marriages for his daughters out of concern for political rivalries from their potential husbands; none of Charlemagne&#x27;s daughters were married, despite political offers of arranged marriages.

In 790, Angilbert retired to the abbey of Centulum, the &quot;Monastery of St Richarius&quot; () at present-day Saint-Riquier in Picardy. Elected abbot in 794, he rebuilt the monastery and endowed it with a library of 200 volumes. It was not uncommon for the Merovingian, Carolingian, or later kings to make laymen abbots of monasteries; the layman would often use the income of the monastery as his own and leave the monks a bare minimum for the necessary expenses of the foundation. Angilbert, in contrast, spent a great deal rebuilding Saint-Riquier; when he completed it, Charlemagne spent Easter of the year 800 there. In keeping with Carolingian policies, Angilbert established a school at Saint-Riquier to educate the local boys.

==Poetry==
Angilbert&#x27;s Latin poems reveal the culture and tastes of a man of the world, enjoying the closest intimacy with the imperial family. Charlemagne and the other men at court were known by affectionate and jesting nicknames. Charlemagne was referred to as &quot;David&quot;, a reference to the Biblical king David. Angilbert was nicknamed &quot;Homer&quot; because he wrote poetry, and was the probable author of an epic, of which the fragment which has been preserved describes the life at the palace and the meeting between Charlemagne and Leo III. It is a mosaic from Virgil, Ovid, Lucan and Venantius Fortunatus, composed in the manner of Einhard&#x27;s use of Suetonius. Of the shorter poems, besides the greeting to Pippin on his return from the campaign against the Avars (796), an epistle to David (i.e., Charlemagne) incidentally reveals a delightful picture of the poet living with his children in a house surrounded by pleasant gardens near the emperor&#x27;s palace. The reference to Bertha, however, is distant and respectful, her name occurring merely on the list of princesses to whom he sends his salutation.

The poem &quot;De conversione Saxonum&quot; has been attributed to Angilbert.

Angilbert&#x27;s poems were published by Ernst Dümmler in the &quot;Monumenta Germaniae Historica&quot;. For criticisms of this edition, see Ludwig Traube in Max Roediger&#x27;s &quot;Schriften für germanische Philologie&quot; (1888).

<doc id="1412" wikidata="Q167198" url="?curid=1412" title="Amine">
<text>In chemistry, amines (, ) are compounds and functional groups that contain a basic nitrogen atom with a lone pair. Formally, amines are derivatives of ammonia ((in which the bond angle between the nitrogen and hydrogen is 107°), wherein one or more hydrogen atoms have been replaced by a substituent such as an alkyl or aryl group (these may respectively be called alkylamines and arylamines; amines in which both types of substituent are attached to one nitrogen atom may be called alkylarylamines). Important amines include amino acids, biogenic amines, trimethylamine, and aniline. Inorganic derivatives of ammonia are also called amines, such as monochloramine ().

The substituent is called an amino group.

The chemical notation for amines contains the letter &quot;R&quot;, where &quot;R&quot; is not an element, but an &quot;R-group&quot;, which in amines could be a single hydrogen or carbon atom, or could be a hydrocarbon chain.

Compounds with a nitrogen atom attached to a carbonyl group, thus having the structure , are called amides and have different chemical properties from amines.

==Classification of amines==
Amines can be classified according to the nature and number of substituents on nitrogen. Aliphatic amines contain only H and alkyl substituents. Aromatic amines have the nitrogen atom connected to an aromatic ring.
Amines, alkyl and aryl alike, are organized into three subcategories  based on the number of carbon atoms adjacent to the nitrogen (how many hydrogen atoms of the ammonia molecule are replaced by hydrocarbon groups):

*Primary (1°) amines—Primary amines arise when one of three hydrogen atoms in ammonia is replaced by an alkyl or aromatic group. Important primary alkyl amines include methylamine, most amino acids, and the buffering agent tris, while primary aromatic amines include aniline.
*Secondary (2°) amines—Secondary amines have two organic substituents (alkyl, aryl or both) bound to the nitrogen together with one hydrogen. Important representatives include dimethylamine, while an example of an aromatic amine would be diphenylamine.
*Tertiary (3°) amines—In tertiary amines, nitrogen has three organic substituents. Examples include trimethylamine, which has a distinctively fishy smell, and EDTA.

A fourth subcategory is determined by the connectivity of the substituents attached to the nitrogen:

*Cyclic amines—Cyclic amines are either secondary or tertiary amines. Examples of cyclic amines include the 3-membered ring aziridine and the six-membered ring piperidine. &quot;N&quot;-methylpiperidine and &quot;N&quot;-phenylpiperidine are examples of cyclic tertiary amines.

It is also possible to have four organic substituents on the nitrogen. These species are not amines but are quaternary ammonium cations and have a charged nitrogen center. Quaternary ammonium salts exist with many kinds of anions.

==Naming conventions==
Amines are named in several ways. Typically, the compound is given the prefix &quot;amino-&quot; or the suffix &quot;-amine&quot;. The prefix &quot;&quot;N&quot;-&quot; shows substitution on the nitrogen atom. An organic compound with multiple amino groups is called a diamine, triamine, tetraamine and so forth.

Lower amines are named with the suffix &quot;-amine&quot;.

Higher amines have the prefix &quot;amino&quot; as a functional group. IUPAC however does not recommend this convention, but prefers the alkanamine form, e.g. butan-2-amine.
==Physical properties==
Hydrogen bonding significantly influences the properties of primary and secondary amines. For example, methyl and ethyl amines are gases under standard conditions, whereas the corresponding methyl and ethyl alcohols are liquids. Amines possess a characteristic ammonia smell, liquid amines have a distinctive &quot;fishy&quot; and foul smell.

The nitrogen atom features a lone electron pair that can bind H+ to form an ammonium ion R3NH+. The lone electron pair is represented in this article by two dots above or next to the N. The water solubility of simple amines is enhanced by hydrogen bonding involving these lone electron pairs. Typically salts of ammonium compounds exhibit the following order of solubility in water: primary ammonium () &gt; secondary ammonium () &gt; tertiary ammonium (R3NH+). Small aliphatic amines display significant solubility in many solvents, whereas those with large substituents are lipophilic. Aromatic amines, such as aniline, have their lone pair electrons conjugated into the benzene ring, thus their tendency to engage in hydrogen bonding is diminished. Their boiling points are high and their solubility in water is low.

===Spectroscopic identification===
Typically the presence of an amine functional group is deduced by a combination of techniques, including mass spectrometry as well as NMR and IR spectroscopies. 1H NMR signals for amines disappear upon treatment of the sample with D2O. In their infrared spectrum primary amines exhibit two N-H bands, whereas secondary amines exhibit only one. In their IR spectra, primary and secondary amines exhibit distinctive N-H stretching bands near 3300 cm−1. Somewhat less distinctive are the bands appearing below 1600 cm−1, which are weaker and overlap with C-C and C-H modes. For the case of propyl amine, the H-N-H scissor mode appears near 1600 cm−1, the C-N stretch near 1000 cm−1, and the R2N-H bend near 810 cm−1.

==Structure==
===Alkyl amines===

Alkyl amines characteristically feature tetrahedral nitrogen centers. C-N-C and C-N-H angles approach the idealized angle of 109°. C-N distances are slightly shorter than C-C distances. The energy barrier for the nitrogen inversion of the stereocenter is about 7 kcal/mol for a trialkylamine. The interconversion has been compared to the inversion of an open umbrella into a strong wind.

Amines of the type NHRR&#x27; and NRR′R″ are chiral: the nitrogen center bears four substituents counting the lone pair. Because of the low barrier to inversion, amines of the type NHRR&#x27; cannot be obtained in optical purity. For chiral tertiary amines, NRR′R″ can only be resolved when the R, R&#x27;, and R″ groups are constrained in cyclic structures such as &quot;N&quot;-substituted aziridines (quaternary ammonium salts are resolvable).

===Aromatic amines===
In aromatic amines (&quot;anilines&quot;), nitrogen is often nearly planar owing to conjugation of the lone pair with the aryl substituent. The C-N distance is correspondingly shorter. In aniline, the C-N distance is the same as the C-C distances.

==Basicity==
Like ammonia, amines are bases. Compared to alkali metal hydroxides, amines are weaker.

The basicity of amines depends on:
# The electronic properties of the substituents (alkyl groups enhance the basicity, aryl groups diminish it).
# The degree of solvation of the protonated amine, which includes steric hindrance by the groups on nitrogen.

===Electronic effects===
Owing to inductive effects, the basicity of an amine might be expected to increase with the number of alkyl groups on the amine. Correlations are complicated owing to the effects of solvation which are opposite the trends for inductive effects. Solvation effects also dominate the basicity of aromatic amines (anilines). For anilines, the lone pair of electrons on nitrogen delocalizes into the ring, resulting in decreased basicity. Substituents on the aromatic ring, and their positions relative to the amino group, also affect basicity as seen in the table.

===Solvation effects===
Solvation significantly affects the basicity of amines. N-H groups strongly interact with water, especially in ammonium ions. Consequently, the basicity of ammonia is enhanced by 1011 by solvation. The intrinsic basicity of amines, i.e. the situation where solvation is unimportant, has been evaluated in the gas phase. In the gas phase, amines exhibit the basicities predicted from the electron-releasing effects of the organic substituents. Thus tertiary amines are more basic than secondary amines, which are more basic than primary amines, and finally ammonia is least basic. The order of pKb&#x27;s (basicities in water) does not follow this order. Similarly aniline is more basic than ammonia in the gas phase, but ten thousand times less so in aqueous solution.

In aprotic polar solvents such as DMSO, DMF, and acetonitrile the energy of solvation is not as high as in protic polar solvents like water and methanol. For this reason, the basicity of amines in these aprotic solvents is almost solely governed by the electronic effects.

== Synthesis ==
===From alcohols===
Industrially significant alkyl amines are prepared from ammonia by alkylation with alcohols:
:&lt;chem&gt;ROH + NH3 -&gt; RNH2 + H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

===From alkyl and aryl halides===
Unlike the reaction of amines with alcohols the reaction of amines and ammonia with alkyl halides is used for synthesis in the laboratory:
:&lt;chem&gt;RX + 2 R&#x27;NH2 -&gt; RR&#x27;NH + [RR&#x27;NH2]X&lt;/chem&gt;
In such reactions, which are more useful for alkyl iodides and bromides, the degree of alkylation is difficult to control such that one obtains mixtures of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, as well as quaternary ammonium salts.

Selectivity can be improved via the Delépine reaction, although this is rarely employed on an industrial scale. Selectivity is also assured in the Gabriel synthesis, which involves organohalide reacting with potassium phthalimide.

Aryl halides are much less reactive toward amines and for that reason are more controllable. A popular way to prepare aryl amines is the Buchwald-Hartwig reaction.

===From alkenes===
Disubstituted alkenes react with HCN in the presence of strong acids to give formamides, which can be decarbonylated. This method, the Ritter reaction, is used industrially to produce tertiary amines such as &quot;tert&quot;-octylamine.

Hydroamination of alkenes is also widely practiced. The reaction is catalyzed by zeolite-based solid acids.

===Reductive routes===
Via the process of hydrogenation, unsaturated N-containing functional groups are reduced to amines using hydrogen in the presence of a nickel catalyst. Suitable groups include nitriles, azides, imines including oximes, amides, and nitro. In the case of nitriles, reactions are sensitive to acidic or alkaline conditions, which can cause hydrolysis of the group.  is more commonly employed for the reduction of these same groups on the laboratory scale.

Many amines are produced from aldehydes and ketones via reductive amination, which can either proceed catalytically or stoichiometrically.

Aniline () and its derivatives are prepared by reduction of the nitroaromatics. In industry, hydrogen is the preferred reductant, whereas, in the laboratory, tin and iron are often employed.

===Specialized methods===
Many methods exist for the preparation of amines, many of these methods being rather specialized.
==Reactions==

===Alkylation, acylation, and sulfonation, etc.===
Aside from their basicity, the dominant reactivity of amines is their nucleophilicity. Most primary amines are good ligands for metal ions to give coordination complexes. Amines are alkylated by alkyl halides. Acyl chlorides and acid anhydrides react with primary and secondary amines to form amides (the &quot;Schotten–Baumann reaction&quot;).

Similarly, with sulfonyl chlorides, one obtains sulfonamides. This transformation, known as the Hinsberg reaction, is a chemical test for the presence of amines.

Because amines are basic, they neutralize acids to form the corresponding ammonium salts . When formed from carboxylic acids and primary and secondary amines, these salts thermally dehydrate to form the corresponding amides.
:formula_1

Amines undergo sulfamation upon treatment with sulfur trioxide or sources thereof: 
:&lt;chem&gt;R2NH + SO3 -&gt; R2NSO3H&lt;/chem&gt;

===Diazotization===
Amines reacts with nitrous acid to give diazonium salts. The alkyl diazonium salts are of little importance because they are too unstable. The most important members are derivatives of aromatic amines such as aniline (&quot;phenylamine&quot;) (A = aryl or naphthyl):
:&lt;chem&gt;ANH2 + HNO2 + HX -&gt; AN2+ + X- + 2 H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

Anilines and naphthylamines form more stable diazonium salts, which can be isolated in the crystalline form. Diazonium salts undergo a variety of useful transformations involving replacement of the group with anions. For example, cuprous cyanide gives the corresponding nitriles:

:&lt;chem&gt;AN2+ + Y- -&gt; AY + N2&lt;/chem&gt;

Aryldiazoniums couple with electron-rich aromatic compounds such as a phenol to form azo compounds. Such reactions are widely applied to the production of dyes.

===Conversion to imines===
Imine formation is an important reaction. Primary amines react with ketones and aldehydes to form imines. In the case of formaldehyde (R&#x27;  H), these products typically exist as cyclic trimers: &lt;chem display=block&gt;RNH2 + R&#x27;_2C=O -&gt; R&#x27;_2C=NR + H2O&lt;/chem&gt; Reduction of these imines gives secondary amines: &lt;chem display=block&gt;R&#x27;_2C=NR + H2 -&gt; R&#x27;_2CH-NHR&lt;/chem&gt;

Similarly, secondary amines react with ketones and aldehydes to form enamines: &lt;chem display=block&gt; R2NH + R&#x27;(R&quot;CH2)C=O -&gt; R&quot;CH=C(NR2)R&#x27; + H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

Mercuric ions reversibly oxidize tertiary amines with an α hydrogen to iminium ions: &lt;chem display=block&gt;Hg^2+ + R2NCH2R&#x27; &lt;=&gt; Hg + [R2N=CHR&#x27;]+ + H+&lt;/chem&gt;

===Overview===
An overview of the reactions of amines is given below:
==Biological activity==
Amines are ubiquitous in biology. The breakdown of amino acids releases amines, famously in the case of decaying fish which smell of trimethylamine. Many neurotransmitters are amines, including epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, and histamine. Protonated amino groups () are the most common positively charged moieties in proteins, specifically in the amino acid lysine. The anionic polymer DNA is typically bound to various amine-rich proteins. Additionally, the terminal charged primary ammonium on lysine forms salt bridges with carboxylate groups of other amino acids in polypeptides, which is one of the primary influences on the three-dimensional structures of proteins.

===Amine hormones===
Hormones derived from the modification of amino acids are referred to as amine hormones. Typically, the original structure of the amino acid is modified such that a –COOH, or carboxyl, group is removed, whereas the , or amine, group remains. Amine hormones are synthesized from the amino acids tryptophan or tyrosine.

==Application of amines==

===Dyes===
Primary aromatic amines are used as a starting material for the manufacture of azo dyes. It reacts with nitrous acid to form diazonium salt, which can undergo coupling reaction to form an azo compound. As azo-compounds are highly coloured, they are widely used in dyeing industries, such as:

* Methyl orange
* Direct brown 138
* Sunset yellow FCF
* Ponceau

===Drugs===
Most drugs and drug candidates contain amine functional groups:
* Chlorpheniramine is an antihistamine that helps to relieve allergic disorders due to cold, hay fever, itchy skin, insect bites and stings.
* Chlorpromazine is a tranquilizer that sedates without inducing sleep. It is used to relieve anxiety, excitement, restlessness or even mental disorder.
* Ephedrine and phenylephrine, as amine hydrochlorides, are used as decongestants.
* Amphetamine, methamphetamine, and methcathinone are psychostimulant amines that are listed as controlled substances by the US DEA.
* Thioridazine, an antipsychotic drug, is an amine which is believed to exhibit its antipsychotic effects, in part, due to its effects on other amines.
* Amitriptyline, imipramine, lofepramine and clomipramine are tricyclic antidepressants and tertiary amines.
* Nortriptyline, desipramine, and amoxapine are tricyclic antidepressants and secondary amines. (The tricyclics are grouped by the nature of the final amino group on the side chain.)
* Substituted tryptamines and phenethylamines are key basic structures for a large variety of psychedelic drugs.
* Opiate analgesics such as morphine, codeine, and heroin are tertiary amines.

===Gas treatment===
Aqueous monoethanolamine (MEA), diglycolamine (DGA), diethanolamine (DEA), diisopropanolamine (DIPA) and methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) are widely used industrially for removing carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) from natural gas and refinery process streams. They may also be used to remove CO2 from combustion gases and flue gases and may have potential for abatement of greenhouse gases. Related processes are known as sweetening.

===Epoxy resin curing agents===
Amines are often used as epoxy resin curing agents. These include dimethylethylamine, cyclohexylamine, and a variety of diamines such as 4,4-diaminodicyclohexylmethane. Multifunctional amines such as tetraethylenepentamine and triethylenetetramine are also widely used in this capacity. The reaction proceeds by the lone pair of electrons on the amine nitrogen attacking the outermost carbon on the oxirane ring of the epoxy resin. This relieves ring strain on the epoxide and is the driving force of the reaction. Molecules with tertiary amine functionality are often used to accelerate the epoxy-amine curing reaction and include substances such as 2,4,6-Tris(dimethylaminomethyl)phenol. It has been stated that this is the most widely used room temperature accelerator for two-component epoxy resin systems.

==Safety==
Low molecular weight simple amines, such as ethylamine, are only weakly toxic with between 100 and 1000 mg/kg. They are skin irritants, especially as some are easily absorbed through the skin. Amines are a broad class of compounds, and more complex members of the class can be extremely bioactive, for example strychnine.

<text>Absolute zero is the coldest point on the thermodynamic temperature scale, a state at which the enthalpy and entropy of a cooled ideal gas reach their minimum value. The fundamental particles of nature have minimum vibrational motion, retaining only quantum mechanical, zero-point energy-induced particle motion. The theoretical temperature is determined by extrapolating the ideal gas law; by international agreement, absolute zero is taken as 0 kelvin (International System of Units), which is −273.15 degrees on the Celsius scale, and equals −459.67 degrees on the Fahrenheit scale (United States customary units or imperial units). The Kelvin and Rankine temperature scales set their zero points at absolute zero by definition.

It is commonly thought of as the lowest temperature possible, but it is not the lowest &quot;enthalpy&quot; state possible, because all real substances begin to depart from the ideal gas when cooled as they approach the change of state to liquid, and then to solid; and the sum of the enthalpy of vaporization (gas to liquid) and enthalpy of fusion (liquid to solid) exceeds the ideal gas&#x27;s change in enthalpy to absolute zero. In the quantum-mechanical description, matter at absolute zero is in its ground state, the point of lowest internal energy.

The laws of thermodynamics show that absolute zero cannot be reached using only thermodynamic means, because the temperature of the substance being cooled approaches the temperature of the cooling agent asymptotically. Even a system at absolute zero, if it could somehow be achieved, would still possess quantum mechanical zero-point energy, the energy of its ground state at absolute zero; the kinetic energy of the ground state cannot be removed. 
Scientists and technologists routinely achieve temperatures close to absolute zero, where matter exhibits quantum effects such as superconductivity, superfluidity, and Bose–Einstein condensation.

==Thermodynamics near absolute zero==
At temperatures near , nearly all molecular motion ceases and Δ&quot;S&quot; = 0 for any adiabatic process, where &quot;S&quot; is the entropy. In such a circumstance, pure substances can (ideally) form perfect crystals with no structural imperfections as &quot;T&quot; → 0. Max Planck&#x27;s strong form of the third law of thermodynamics states the entropy of a perfect crystal vanishes at absolute zero. The original Nernst &quot;heat theorem&quot; makes the weaker and less controversial claim that the entropy change for any isothermal process approaches zero as &quot;T&quot; → 0:
:formula_1

The implication is that the entropy of a perfect crystal approaches a constant value. An adiabat is a state with constant entropy, typically represented on a graph as a curve in a manner similar to isotherms and isobars.

The Nernst postulate identifies the isotherm T = 0 as coincident with the adiabat S = 0, although other isotherms and adiabats are distinct. As no two adiabats intersect, no other adiabat can intersect the T = 0 isotherm. Consequently no adiabatic process initiated at nonzero temperature can lead to zero temperature (≈ Callen, pp. 189–190).

A perfect crystal is one in which the internal lattice structure extends uninterrupted in all directions. The perfect order can be represented by translational symmetry along three (not usually orthogonal) axes. Every lattice element of the structure is in its proper place, whether it is a single atom or a molecular grouping. For substances that exist in two (or more) stable crystalline forms, such as diamond and graphite for carbon, there is a kind of &quot;chemical degeneracy&quot;. The question remains whether both can have zero entropy at &quot;T&quot; = 0 even though each is perfectly ordered.

Perfect crystals never occur in practice; imperfections, and even entire amorphous material inclusions, can and do get &quot;frozen in&quot; at low temperatures, so transitions to more stable states do not occur.

Using the Debye model, the specific heat and entropy of a pure crystal are proportional to &quot;T&quot; 3, while the enthalpy and chemical potential are proportional to &quot;T&quot; 4 (Guggenheim, p. 111). These quantities drop toward their &quot;T&quot; = 0 limiting values and approach with &quot;zero&quot; slopes. For the specific heats at least, the limiting value itself is definitely zero, as borne out by experiments to below 10 K. Even the less detailed Einstein model shows this curious drop in specific heats. In fact, all specific heats vanish at absolute zero, not just those of crystals. Likewise for the coefficient of thermal expansion. Maxwell&#x27;s relations show that various other quantities also vanish. These phenomena were unanticipated.

Since the relation between changes in Gibbs free energy (&quot;G&quot;), the enthalpy (&quot;H&quot;) and the entropy is

:formula_2

thus, as &quot;T&quot; decreases, Δ&quot;G&quot; and Δ&quot;H&quot; approach each other (so long as Δ&quot;S&quot; is bounded). Experimentally, it is found that all spontaneous processes (including chemical reactions) result in a decrease in &quot;G&quot; as they proceed toward equilibrium. If Δ&quot;S&quot; and/or &quot;T&quot; are small, the condition Δ&quot;G&quot; &lt; 0 may imply that Δ&quot;H&quot; &lt; 0, which would indicate an exothermic reaction. However, this is not required; endothermic reactions can proceed spontaneously if the &quot;T&quot;Δ&quot;S&quot; term is large enough.

Moreover, the slopes of the derivatives of Δ&quot;G&quot; and Δ&quot;H&quot; converge and are equal to zero at &quot;T&quot; = 0. This ensures that Δ&quot;G&quot; and Δ&quot;H&quot; are nearly the same over a considerable range of temperatures and justifies the approximate empirical Principle of Thomsen and Berthelot, which states that &quot;the equilibrium state to which a system proceeds is the one that evolves the greatest amount of heat&quot;, i.e., an actual process is the &quot;most exothermic one&quot; (Callen, pp. 186–187).

One model that estimates the properties of an electron gas at absolute zero in metals is the Fermi gas. The electrons, being fermions, must be in different quantum states, which leads the electrons to get very high typical velocities, even at absolute zero. The maximum energy that electrons can have at absolute zero is called the Fermi energy. The Fermi temperature is defined as this maximum energy divided by the Boltzmann constant, and is on the order of 80,000 K for typical electron densities found in metals. For temperatures significantly below the Fermi temperature, the electrons behave in almost the same way as at absolute zero. This explains the failure of the classical equipartition theorem for metals that eluded classical physicists in the late 19th century.

==Relation with Bose–Einstein condensate==

A Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC) is a state of matter of a dilute gas of weakly interacting bosons confined in an external potential and cooled to temperatures very near absolute zero. Under such conditions, a large fraction of the bosons occupy the lowest quantum state of the external potential, at which point quantum effects become apparent on a macroscopic scale.

This state of matter was first predicted by Satyendra Nath Bose and Albert Einstein in 1924–1925. Bose first sent a paper to Einstein on the quantum statistics of light quanta (now called photons). Einstein was impressed, translated the paper from English to German and submitted it for Bose to the &quot;Zeitschrift für Physik&quot;, which published it. Einstein then extended Bose&#x27;s ideas to material particles (or matter) in two other papers.

Seventy years later, in 1995, the first gaseous condensate was produced by Eric Cornell and Carl Wieman at the University of Colorado at Boulder NIST-JILA lab, using a gas of rubidium atoms cooled to ().

In 2003, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) achieved a temperature of () in a BEC of sodium atoms. The associated black-body (peak emittance) wavelength of 6.4 megameters is roughly the radius of Earth.

In 2021, University of Bremen physicists achieved a BEC with a temperature of only , the current coldest temperature record.

==Absolute temperature scales==
Absolute, or thermodynamic, temperature is conventionally measured in kelvin (Celsius-scaled increments) and in the Rankine scale (Fahrenheit-scaled increments) with increasing rarity. Absolute temperature measurement is uniquely determined by a multiplicative constant which specifies the size of the &quot;degree&quot;, so the &quot;ratios&quot; of two absolute temperatures, &quot;T&quot;2/&quot;T&quot;1, are the same in all scales. The most transparent definition of this standard comes from the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. It can also be found in Fermi–Dirac statistics (for particles of half-integer spin) and Bose–Einstein statistics (for particles of integer spin). All of these define the relative numbers of particles in a system as decreasing exponential functions of energy (at the particle level) over &quot;kT&quot;, with &quot;k&quot; representing the Boltzmann constant and &quot;T&quot; representing the temperature observed at the macroscopic level.

==Negative temperatures==
Temperatures that are expressed as negative numbers on the familiar Celsius or Fahrenheit scales are simply colder than the zero points of those scales. Certain systems can achieve truly negative temperatures; that is, their thermodynamic temperature (expressed in kelvins) can be of a negative quantity. A system with a truly negative temperature is not colder than absolute zero. Rather, a system with a negative temperature is hotter than &quot;any&quot; system with a positive temperature, in the sense that if a negative-temperature system and a positive-temperature system come in contact, heat flows from the negative to the positive-temperature system.

Most familiar systems cannot achieve negative temperatures because adding energy always increases their entropy. However, some systems have a maximum amount of energy that they can hold, and as they approach that maximum energy their entropy actually begins to decrease. Because temperature is defined by the relationship between energy and entropy, such a system&#x27;s temperature becomes negative, even though energy is being added. As a result, the Boltzmann factor for states of systems at negative temperature increases rather than decreases with increasing state energy. Therefore, no complete system, i.e. including the electromagnetic modes, can have negative temperatures, since there is no highest energy state, so that the sum of the probabilities of the states would diverge for negative temperatures. However, for quasi-equilibrium systems (e.g. spins out of equilibrium with the electromagnetic field) this argument does not apply, and negative effective temperatures are attainable.

On 3 January 2013, physicists announced that for the first time they had created a quantum gas made up of potassium atoms with a negative temperature in motional degrees of freedom.

==History==

One of the first to discuss the possibility of an absolute minimal temperature was Robert Boyle. His 1665 &quot;New Experiments and Observations touching Cold&quot;, articulated the dispute known as the &quot;primum frigidum&quot;. The concept was well known among naturalists of the time. Some contended an absolute minimum temperature occurred within earth (as one of the four classical elements), others within water, others air, and some more recently within nitre. But all of them seemed to agree that, &quot;There is some body or other that is of its own nature supremely cold and by participation of which all other bodies obtain that quality.&quot;

===Limit to the &quot;degree of cold&quot;===
The question of whether there is a limit to the degree of coldness possible, and, if so, where the zero must be placed, was first addressed by the French physicist Guillaume Amontons in 1703, in connection with his improvements in the air thermometer. His instrument indicated temperatures by the height at which a certain mass of air sustained a column of mercury—the pressure, or &quot;spring&quot; of the air varying with temperature. Amontons therefore argued that the zero of his thermometer would be that temperature at which the spring of the air was reduced to nothing. He used a scale that marked the boiling point of water at +73 and the melting point of ice at +, so that the zero was equivalent to about −240 on the Celsius scale. Amontons held that the absolute zero cannot be reached, so never attempted to compute it explicitly. The value of −240 °C, or &quot;431 divisions [in Fahrenheit&#x27;s thermometer] below the cold of freezing water&quot; was published by George Martine in 1740.

This close approximation to the modern value of −273.15 °C for the zero of the air thermometer was further improved upon in 1779 by Johann Heinrich Lambert, who observed that might be regarded as absolute cold.

Values of this order for the absolute zero were not, however, universally accepted about this period. Pierre-Simon Laplace and Antoine Lavoisier, in their 1780 treatise on heat, arrived at values ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 below the freezing point of water, and thought that in any case it must be at least 600 below. John Dalton in his &quot;Chemical Philosophy&quot; gave ten calculations of this value, and finally adopted −3,000 °C as the natural zero of temperature.

===Charles&#x27;s law===
From 1787 to 1802, it was determined by Jacques Charles (unpublished), John Dalton, and Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac that, at constant pressure, ideal gases expanded or contracted their volume linearly (Charles&#x27;s law) by about 1/273 parts per degree Celsius of temperature&#x27;s change up or down, between 0° and 100° C. This suggested that the volume of a gas cooled at about −273 °C would reach zero.

===Lord Kelvin&#x27;s work===
After James Prescott Joule had determined the mechanical equivalent of heat, Lord Kelvin approached the question from an entirely different point of view, and in 1848 devised a scale of absolute temperature that was independent of the properties of any particular substance and was based on Carnot&#x27;s theory of the Motive Power of Heat and data published by Henri Victor Regnault. It followed from the principles on which this scale was constructed that its zero was placed at −273 °C, at almost precisely the same point as the zero of the air thermometer, where the air volume would reach &quot;nothing&quot;. This value was not immediately accepted; values ranging from to , derived from laboratory measurements and observations of astronomical refraction, remained in use in the early 20th century.

===The race to absolute zero===
With a better theoretical understanding of absolute zero, scientists were eager to reach this temperature in the lab. By 1845, Michael Faraday had managed to liquefy most gases then known to exist, and reached a new record for lowest temperatures by reaching . Faraday believed that certain gases, such as oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen, were permanent gases and could not be liquefied. Decades later, in 1873 Dutch theoretical scientist Johannes Diderik van der Waals demonstrated that these gases could be liquefied, but only under conditions of very high pressure and very low temperatures. In 1877, Louis Paul Cailletet in France and Raoul Pictet in Switzerland succeeded in producing the first droplets of liquid air at . This was followed in 1883 by the production of liquid oxygen by the Polish professors Zygmunt Wróblewski and Karol Olszewski.

Scottish chemist and physicist James Dewar and Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes took on the challenge to liquefy the remaining gases, hydrogen and helium. In 1898, after 20 years of effort, Dewar was the first to liquefy hydrogen, reaching a new low-temperature record of . However, Kamerlingh Onnes, his rival, was the first to liquefy helium, in 1908, using several precooling stages and the Hampson–Linde cycle. He lowered the temperature to the boiling point of helium . By reducing the pressure of the liquid helium, he achieved an even lower temperature, near 1.5 K. These were the coldest temperatures achieved on Earth at the time and his achievement earned him the Nobel Prize in 1913. Kamerlingh Onnes would continue to study the properties of materials at temperatures near absolute zero, describing superconductivity and superfluids for the first time.

==Very low temperatures==
The average temperature of the universe today is approximately , based on measurements of cosmic microwave background radiation. Standard models of the future expansion of the universe predict that the average temperature of the universe is decreasing over time. This temperature is calculated as the mean density of energy in space; it should not be confused with the mean electron temperature (total energy divided by particle count) which has increased over time.

Absolute zero cannot be achieved, although it is possible to reach temperatures close to it through the use of evaporative cooling, cryocoolers, dilution refrigerators, and nuclear adiabatic demagnetization. The use of laser cooling has produced temperatures of less than a billionth of a kelvin. At very low temperatures in the vicinity of absolute zero, matter exhibits many unusual properties, including superconductivity, superfluidity, and Bose–Einstein condensation. To study such phenomena, scientists have worked to obtain even lower temperatures.
* In November 2000, nuclear spin temperatures below were reported for an experiment at the Helsinki University of Technology&#x27;s Low Temperature Lab in Espoo, Finland. However, this was the temperature of one particular degree of freedom—a quantum property called nuclear spin—not the overall average thermodynamic temperature for all possible degrees in freedom.
* In February 2003, the Boomerang Nebula was observed to have been releasing gases at a speed of for the last 1,500 years. This has cooled it down to approximately 1 K, as deduced by astronomical observation, which is the lowest natural temperature ever recorded.
* In November 2003, 90377 Sedna was discovered and is one of the coldest known objects in the Solar System, with an average surface temperature of , due to its extremely far orbit of 903 astronomical units.
* In May 2005, the European Space Agency proposed research in space to achieve femtokelvin temperatures.
* In May 2006, the Institute of Quantum Optics at the University of Hannover gave details of technologies and benefits of femtokelvin research in space.
* In January 2013, physicist Ulrich Schneider of the University of Munich in Germany reported to have achieved temperatures formally below absolute zero (&quot;negative temperature&quot;) in gases. The gas is artificially forced out of equilibrium into a high potential energy state, which is, however, cold. When it then emits radiation it approaches the equilibrium, and can continue emitting despite reaching formal absolute zero; thus, the temperature is formally negative.
* In September 2014, scientists in the CUORE collaboration at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy cooled a copper vessel with a volume of one cubic meter to for 15 days, setting a record for the lowest temperature in the known universe over such a large contiguous volume.
* In June 2015, experimental physicists at MIT cooled molecules in a gas of sodium potassium to a temperature of 500 nanokelvin, and it is expected to exhibit an exotic state of matter by cooling these molecules somewhat further.
* In 2017, Cold Atom Laboratory (CAL), an experimental instrument was developed for launch to the International Space Station (ISS) in 2018. The instrument has created extremely cold conditions in the microgravity environment of the ISS leading to the formation of Bose–Einstein condensates. In this space-based laboratory, temperatures as low as are projected to be achievable, and it could further the exploration of unknown quantum mechanical phenomena and test some of the most fundamental laws of physics.
* The current world record for effective temperatures was set in 2021 at through matter-wave lensing of rubidium Bose–Einstein condensates.

<doc id="1419" wikidata="Q182453" url="?curid=1419" title="Adiabatic process">
<text>An adiabatic process (&quot;adiabatic&quot; ) is a type of thermodynamic process that occurs without transferring heat between the thermodynamic system and its environment. Unlike an isothermal process, an adiabatic process transfers energy to the surroundings only as work and/or mass flow. As a key concept in thermodynamics, the adiabatic process supports the theory that explains the first law of thermodynamics. The opposite term to &quot;adiabatic&quot; is &quot;diabatic&quot;.

Some chemical and physical processes occur too rapidly for energy to enter or leave the system as heat, allowing a convenient &quot;adiabatic approximation&quot;. For example, the adiabatic flame temperature uses this approximation to calculate the upper limit of flame temperature by assuming combustion loses no heat to its surroundings.

In meteorology, adiabatic expansion and cooling of moist air, which can be triggered by winds flowing up and over a mountain for example, can cause the water vapor pressure to exceed the saturation vapor pressure. Expansion and cooling beyond the saturation vapor pressure is often idealized as a &quot;pseudo-adiabatic process&quot; whereby excess vapor instantly precipitates into water droplets. The change in temperature of an air undergoing pseudo-adiabatic expansion differs from air undergoing adiabatic expansion because latent heat is released by precipitation.

==Description==

A process without transfer of heat to or from a system, so that , is called adiabatic, and such a system is said to be adiabatically isolated. The simplifying assumption frequently made is that a process is adiabatic. For example, the compression of a gas within a cylinder of an engine is assumed to occur so rapidly that on the time scale of the compression process, little of the system&#x27;s energy can be transferred out as heat to the surroundings. Even though the cylinders are not insulated and are quite conductive, that process is idealized to be adiabatic. The same can be said to be true for the expansion process of such a system.

The assumption of adiabatic isolation is useful and often combined with other such idealizations to calculate a good first approximation of a system&#x27;s behaviour. For example, according to Laplace, when sound travels in a gas, there is no time for heat conduction in the medium, and so the propagation of sound is adiabatic. For such an adiabatic process, the modulus of elasticity (Young&#x27;s modulus) can be expressed as , where is the ratio of specific heats at constant pressure and at constant volume () and is the pressure of the gas.

=== Various applications of the adiabatic assumption ===

For a closed system, one may write the first law of thermodynamics as , where denotes the change of the system&#x27;s internal energy, the quantity of energy added to it as heat, and the work done by the system on its surroundings.

*If the system has such rigid walls that work cannot be transferred in or out (), and the walls are not adiabatic and energy is added in the form of heat (), and there is no phase change, then the temperature of the system will rise.
*If the system has such rigid walls that pressure–volume work cannot be done, but the walls are adiabatic (), and energy is added as isochoric (constant volume) work in the form of friction or the stirring of a viscous fluid within the system (), and there is no phase change, then the temperature of the system will rise.
*If the system walls are adiabatic () but not rigid (), and, in a fictive idealized process, energy is added to the system in the form of frictionless, non-viscous pressure–volume work (), and there is no phase change, then the temperature of the system will rise. Such a process is called an isentropic process and is said to be &quot;reversible&quot;. Ideally, if the process were reversed the energy could be recovered entirely as work done by the system. If the system contains a compressible gas and is reduced in volume, the uncertainty of the position of the gas is reduced, and seemingly would reduce the entropy of the system, but the temperature of the system will rise as the process is isentropic (). Should the work be added in such a way that friction or viscous forces are operating within the system, then the process is not isentropic, and if there is no phase change, then the temperature of the system will rise, the process is said to be &quot;irreversible&quot;, and the work added to the system is not entirely recoverable in the form of work.
*If the walls of a system are not adiabatic, and energy is transferred in as heat, entropy is transferred into the system with the heat. Such a process is neither adiabatic nor isentropic, having , and according to the second law of thermodynamics.

Naturally occurring adiabatic processes are irreversible (entropy is produced).

The transfer of energy as work into an adiabatically isolated system can be imagined as being of two idealized extreme kinds. In one such kind, no entropy is produced within the system (no friction, viscous dissipation, etc.), and the work is only pressure-volume work (denoted by ). In nature, this ideal kind occurs only approximately because it demands an infinitely slow process and no sources of dissipation.

The other extreme kind of work is isochoric work (), for which energy is added as work solely through friction or viscous dissipation within the system. A stirrer that transfers energy to a viscous fluid of an adiabatically isolated system with rigid walls, without phase change, will cause a rise in temperature of the fluid, but that work is not recoverable. Isochoric work is irreversible. The second law of thermodynamics observes that a natural process, of transfer of energy as work, always consists at least of isochoric work and often both of these extreme kinds of work. Every natural process, adiabatic or not, is irreversible, with , as friction or viscosity are always present to some extent.

==Adiabatic compression and expansion==
The adiabatic compression of a gas causes a rise in temperature of the gas. Adiabatic expansion against pressure, or a spring, causes a drop in temperature. In contrast, free expansion is an isothermal process for an ideal gas.

Adiabatic compression occurs when the pressure of a gas is increased by work done on it by its surroundings, e.g., a piston compressing a gas contained within a cylinder and raising the temperature where in many practical situations heat conduction through walls can be slow compared with the compression time. This finds practical application in diesel engines which rely on the lack of heat dissipation during the compression stroke to elevate the fuel vapor temperature sufficiently to ignite it.

Adiabatic compression occurs in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere when an air mass descends, for example, in a Katabatic wind, Foehn wind, or Chinook wind flowing downhill over a mountain range. When a parcel of air descends, the pressure on the parcel increases. Because of this increase in pressure, the parcel&#x27;s volume decreases and its temperature increases as work is done on the parcel of air, thus increasing its internal energy, which manifests itself by a rise in the temperature of that mass of air. The parcel of air can only slowly dissipate the energy by conduction or radiation (heat), and to a first approximation it can be considered adiabatically isolated and the process an adiabatic process.

Adiabatic expansion occurs when the pressure on an adiabatically isolated system is decreased, allowing it to expand in size, thus causing it to do work on its surroundings. When the pressure applied on a parcel of gas is reduced, the gas in the parcel is allowed to expand; as the volume increases, the temperature falls as its internal energy decreases. Adiabatic expansion occurs in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere with orographic lifting and lee waves, and this can form pilei or lenticular clouds.

Due in part to adiabatic expansion in mountainous areas, snowfall infrequently occurs in some parts of the Sahara desert.

Adiabatic expansion does not have to involve a fluid. One technique used to reach very low temperatures (thousandths and even millionths of a degree above absolute zero) is via adiabatic demagnetisation, where the change in magnetic field on a magnetic material is used to provide adiabatic expansion. Also, the contents of an expanding universe can be described (to first order) as an adiabatically expanding fluid. (See heat death of the universe.)

Rising magma also undergoes adiabatic expansion before eruption, particularly significant in the case of magmas that rise quickly from great depths such as kimberlites.

In the Earth&#x27;s convecting mantle (the asthenosphere) beneath the lithosphere, the mantle temperature is approximately an adiabat. The slight decrease in temperature with shallowing depth is due to the decrease in pressure the shallower the material is in the Earth.

Such temperature changes can be quantified using the ideal gas law, or the hydrostatic equation for atmospheric processes.

In practice, no process is truly adiabatic. Many processes rely on a large difference in time scales of the process of interest and the rate of heat dissipation across a system boundary, and thus are approximated by using an adiabatic assumption. There is always some heat loss, as no perfect insulators exist.

==Ideal gas (reversible process)==

The mathematical equation for an ideal gas undergoing a reversible (i.e., no entropy generation) adiabatic process can be represented by the polytropic process equation

formula_1

where is pressure, is volume, and is the adiabatic index or heat capacity ratio defined as

formula_2

Here is the specific heat for constant pressure, is the specific heat for constant volume, and is the number of degrees of freedom (3 for a monatomic gas, 5 for a diatomic gas or a gas of linear molecules such as carbon dioxide).

For a monatomic ideal gas, , and for a diatomic gas (such as nitrogen and oxygen, the main components of air), . Note that the above formula is only applicable to classical ideal gases (that is, gases far above absolute zero temperature) and not Bose–Einstein or Fermi gases.

One can also use the ideal gas law to rewrite the above relationship between and as 

formula_3

where &quot;T&quot; is the absolute or thermodynamic temperature.

===Example of adiabatic compression===
The compression stroke in a gasoline engine can be used as an example of adiabatic compression. The model assumptions are: the uncompressed volume of the cylinder is one litre (1 L = 1000 cm3 = 0.001 m3); the gas within is the air consisting of molecular nitrogen and oxygen only (thus a diatomic gas with 5 degrees of freedom, and so ); the compression ratio of the engine is 10:1 (that is, the 1 L volume of uncompressed gas is reduced to 0.1 L by the piston); and the uncompressed gas is at approximately room temperature and pressure (a warm room temperature of ~27 °C, or 300 K, and a pressure of 1 bar = 100 kPa, i.e. typical sea-level atmospheric pressure).

formula_4

so the adiabatic constant for this example is about 

The gas is now compressed to a 0.1 L (0.0001 m3) volume, which we assume happens quickly enough that no heat enters or leaves the gas through the walls. The adiabatic constant remains the same, but with the resulting pressure unknown

formula_5

We can now solve for the final pressure

formula_6

or 25.1 bar. This pressure increase is more than a simple 10:1 compression ratio would indicate; this is because the gas is not only compressed, but the work done to compress the gas also increases its internal energy, which manifests itself by a rise in the gas temperature and an additional rise in pressure above what would result from a simplistic calculation of 10 times the original pressure.

We can solve for the temperature of the compressed gas in the engine cylinder as well, using the ideal gas law, &quot;PV&quot; = &quot;nRT&quot; (&quot;n&quot; is amount of gas in moles and &quot;R&quot; the gas constant for that gas). Our initial conditions being 100 kPa of pressure, 1 L volume, and 300 K of temperature, our experimental constant (&quot;nR&quot;) is:

formula_7

We know the compressed gas has  = 0.1 L and  = , so we can solve for temperature:

formula_8

That is a final temperature of 753 K, or 479 °C, or 896 °F, well above the ignition point of many fuels. This is why a high-compression engine requires fuels specially formulated to not self-ignite (which would cause engine knocking when operated under these conditions of temperature and pressure), or that a supercharger with an intercooler to provide a pressure boost but with a lower temperature rise would be advantageous. A diesel engine operates under even more extreme conditions, with compression ratios of 16:1 or more being typical, in order to provide a very high gas pressure, which ensures immediate ignition of the injected fuel.

===Adiabatic free expansion of a gas===

For an adiabatic free expansion of an ideal gas, the gas is contained in an insulated container and then allowed to expand in a vacuum. Because there is no external pressure for the gas to expand against, the work done by or on the system is zero. Since this process does not involve any heat transfer or work, the first law of thermodynamics then implies that the net internal energy change of the system is zero. For an ideal gas, the temperature remains constant because the internal energy only depends on temperature in that case. Since at constant temperature, the entropy is proportional to the volume, the entropy increases in this case, therefore this process is irreversible.

===Derivation of &quot;P&quot;–&quot;V&quot; relation for adiabatic compression and expansion===
The definition of an adiabatic process is that heat transfer to the system is zero, . Then, according to the first law of thermodynamics,

where is the change in the internal energy of the system and is work done &quot;by&quot; the system. Any work () done must be done at the expense of internal energy , since no heat is being supplied from the surroundings. Pressure–volume work done &quot;by&quot; the system is defined as

However, does not remain constant during an adiabatic process but instead changes along with .

It is desired to know how the values of and relate to each other as the adiabatic process proceeds. For an ideal gas (recall ideal gas law ) the internal energy is given by

where is the number of degrees of freedom divided by 2, is the universal gas constant and is the number of moles in the system (a constant).

Differentiating equation (a3) yields

Equation (a4) is often expressed as because .

Now substitute equations (a2) and (a4) into equation (a1) to obtain

formula_9

factorize :

formula_10

and divide both sides by :

formula_11

After integrating the left and right sides from to and from to and changing the sides respectively,

formula_12

Exponentiate both sides, substitute with , the heat capacity ratio

formula_13

and eliminate the negative sign to obtain

formula_14

Therefore,

formula_15

and

formula_16

At the same time, the work done by the pressure–volume changes as a result from this process, is equal to

Since we require the process to be adiabatic, the following equation needs to be true

By the previous derivation,

Rearranging (b4) gives

formula_17

Substituting this into (b2) gives

formula_18

Integrating, we obtain the expression for work,

formula_19

Substituting in the second term,

formula_20

Rearranging,

formula_21

Using the ideal gas law and assuming a constant molar quantity (as often happens in practical cases),

formula_22

By the continuous formula,

formula_23

or

formula_24

Substituting into the previous expression for ,

formula_25

Substituting this expression and (b1) in (b3) gives

formula_26

Simplifying,

formula_27

===Derivation of discrete formula and work expression===
The change in internal energy of a system, measured from state 1 to state 2, is equal to

==Graphing adiabats==

An adiabat is a curve of constant entropy in a diagram. Some properties of adiabats on a &quot;P&quot;–&quot;V&quot; diagram are indicated. These properties may be read from the classical behaviour of ideal gases, except in the region where &quot;PV&quot; becomes small (low temperature), where quantum effects become important.

# Every adiabat asymptotically approaches both the &quot;V&quot; axis and the &quot;P&quot; axis (just like isotherms).
# Each adiabat intersects each isotherm exactly once.
# An adiabat looks similar to an isotherm, except that during an expansion, an adiabat loses more pressure than an isotherm, so it has a steeper inclination (more vertical).
# If isotherms are concave towards the north-east direction (45° from V-axis), then adiabats are concave towards the east north-east (31° from V-axis).
# If adiabats and isotherms are graphed at regular intervals of entropy and temperature, respectively (like altitude on a contour map), then as the eye moves towards the axes (towards the south-west), it sees the density of isotherms stay constant, but it sees the density of adiabats grow. The exception is very near absolute zero, where the density of adiabats drops sharply and they become rare (see Nernst&#x27;s theorem).

==Etymology==
The term &quot;adiabatic&quot; () is an anglicization of the Greek term ἀδιάβατος &quot;impassable&quot; (used by Xenophon of rivers). It is used in the thermodynamic sense by Rankine (1866), and adopted by Maxwell in 1871 (explicitly attributing the term to Rankine).
The etymological origin corresponds here to an impossibility of transfer of energy as heat and of transfer of matter across the wall.

The Greek word ἀδιάβατος is formed from privative ἀ- (&quot;not&quot;) and διαβατός, &quot;passable&quot;, in turn deriving from διά (&quot;through&quot;), and βαῖνειν (&quot;to walk, go, come&quot;).

Furthermore, in atmospheric thermodynamics, a diabatic process is one in which heat is exchanged. An adiabatic process is the opposite – a process in which no heat is exchanged.

==Conceptual significance in thermodynamic theory==

The adiabatic process has been important for thermodynamics since its early days. It was important in the work of Joule because it provided a way of nearly directly relating quantities of heat and work.

Energy can enter or leave a thermodynamic system enclosed by walls that prevent mass transfer only as heat or work. Therefore, a quantity of work in such a system can be related almost directly to an equivalent quantity of heat in a cycle of two limbs. The first limb is an isochoric adiabatic work process increasing the system&#x27;s internal energy; the second, an isochoric and workless heat transfer returning the system to its original state. Accordingly, Rankine measured quantity of heat in units of work, rather than as a calorimetric quantity. In 1854, Rankine used a quantity that he called &quot;the thermodynamic function&quot; that later was called entropy, and at that time he wrote also of the &quot;curve of no transmission of heat&quot;, which he later called an adiabatic curve. Besides its two isothermal limbs, Carnot&#x27;s cycle has two adiabatic limbs.

For the foundations of thermodynamics, the conceptual importance of this was emphasized by Bryan, by Carathéodory, and by Born. The reason is that calorimetry presupposes a type of temperature as already defined before the statement of the first law of thermodynamics, such as one based on empirical scales. Such a presupposition involves making the distinction between empirical temperature and absolute temperature. Rather, the definition of absolute thermodynamic temperature is best left till the second law is available as a conceptual basis.

In the eighteenth century, the law of conservation of energy was not yet fully formulated or established, and the nature of heat was debated. One approach to these problems was to regard heat, measured by calorimetry, as a primary substance that is conserved in quantity. By the middle of the nineteenth century, it was recognized as a form of energy, and the law of conservation of energy was thereby also recognized. The view that eventually established itself, and is currently regarded as right, is that the law of conservation of energy is a primary axiom, and that heat is to be analyzed as consequential. In this light, heat cannot be a component of the total energy of a single body because it is not a state variable but, rather, a variable that describes a transfer between two bodies. The adiabatic process is important because it is a logical ingredient of this current view.

==Divergent usages of the word &quot;adiabatic&quot;==
This present article is written from the viewpoint of macroscopic thermodynamics, and the word &quot;adiabatic&quot; is used in this article in the traditional way of thermodynamics, introduced by Rankine. It is pointed out in the present article that, for example, if a compression of a gas is rapid, then there is little time for heat transfer to occur, even when the gas is not adiabatically isolated by a definite wall. In this sense, a rapid compression of a gas is sometimes approximately or loosely said to be &quot;adiabatic&quot;, though often far from isentropic, even when the gas is not adiabatically isolated by a definite wall.

Some authors, like Pippard, recommend using &quot;adiathermal&quot; to refer to processes where no heat-exchange occurs (such as Joule expansion), and &quot;adiabatic&quot; to reversible quasi-static adiathermal processes (so that rapid compression of a gas is &quot;not&quot; &quot;adiabatic&quot;). And Laidler has summarized the complicated etymology of &quot;adiabatic&quot;.

Quantum mechanics and quantum statistical mechanics, however, use the word &quot;adiabatic&quot; in a very different sense, one that can at times seem almost opposite to the classical thermodynamic sense. In quantum theory, the word &quot;adiabatic&quot; can mean something perhaps near isentropic, or perhaps near quasi-static, but the usage of the word is very different between the two disciplines.

On the one hand, in quantum theory, if a perturbative element of compressive work is done almost infinitely slowly (that is to say quasi-statically), it is said to have been done &quot;adiabatically&quot;. The idea is that the shapes of the eigenfunctions change slowly and continuously, so that no quantum jump is triggered, and the change is virtually reversible. While the occupation numbers are unchanged, nevertheless there is change in the energy levels of one-to-one corresponding, pre- and post-compression, eigenstates. Thus a perturbative element of work has been done without heat transfer and without introduction of random change within the system. For example, Max Born writes

On the other hand, in quantum theory, if a perturbative element of compressive work is done rapidly, it changes the occupation numbers and energies of the eigenstates in proportion to the transition moment integral and in accordance with time-dependent perturbation theory, as well as perturbing the functional form of the eigenstates themselves. In that theory, such a rapid change is said not to be &quot;adiabatic&quot;, and the contrary word &quot;diabatic&quot; is applied to it.

Recent research suggests that the power absorbed from the perturbation corresponds to the rate of these non-adiabatic transitions. This corresponds to the classical process of energy transfer in the form of heat, but with the relative time scales reversed in the quantum case. Quantum adiabatic processes occur over relatively long time scales, while classical adiabatic processes occur over relatively short time scales. It should also be noted that the concept of &#x27;heat&#x27; (in reference to the quantity of thermal energy transferred) breaks down at the quantum level, and the specific form of energy (typically electromagnetic) must be considered instead. The small or negligible absorption of energy from the perturbation in a quantum adiabatic process provides a good justification for identifying it as the quantum analogue of adiabatic processes in classical thermodynamics, and for the reuse of the term.

In classical thermodynamics, such a rapid change would still be called adiabatic because the system is adiabatically isolated, and there is no transfer of energy as heat. The strong irreversibility of the change, due to viscosity or other entropy production, does not impinge on this classical usage.

Thus for a mass of gas, in macroscopic thermodynamics, words are so used that a compression is sometimes loosely or approximately said to be adiabatic if it is rapid enough to avoid significant heat transfer, even if the system is not adiabatically isolated. But in quantum statistical theory, a compression is not called adiabatic if it is rapid, even if the system is adiabatically isolated in the classical thermodynamic sense of the term. The words are used differently in the two disciplines, as stated just above.

<doc id="1422" wikidata="Q188777" url="?curid=1422" title="Amide">
<text>In organic chemistry, an amide, also known as an organic amide or a carboxamide, is a compound with the general formula , where R, R&#x27;, and R″ represent any group, typically organyl groups or hydrogen atoms. The amide group is called a peptide bond when it is part of the main chain of a protein, and an isopeptide bond when it occurs in a side chain, as in asparagine and glutamine. It can be viewed as a derivative of a carboxylic acid () with the hydroxyl group () replaced by an amino group (); or, equivalently, an acyl (alkanoyl) group () joined to an amino group.

Common of amides are formamide (), acetamide (), benzamide (), and dimethylformamide (). Some uncommon examples of amides are &quot;N&quot;-chloroacetamide () and chloroformamide ().

Amides are qualified as primary, secondary, and tertiary according to the number of carbon atoms bounded to the nitrogen atom.

==Nomenclature==

The core of amides is called the amide group (specifically, carboxamide group).

In the usual nomenclature, one adds the term &quot;amide&quot; to the stem of the parent acid&#x27;s name. For instance, the amide derived from acetic acid is named acetamide (CH3CONH2). IUPAC recommends ethanamide, but this and related formal names are rarely encountered. When the amide is derived from a primary or secondary amine, the substituents on nitrogen are indicated first in the name. Thus, the amide formed from dimethylamine and acetic acid is &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dimethylacetamide (CH3CONMe2, where Me = CH3). Usually even this name is simplified to dimethylacetamide. Cyclic amides are called lactams; they are necessarily secondary or tertiary amides.

==Applications==

Amides are pervasive in nature and technology. Proteins and important plastics like nylons, aramids, Twaron, and Kevlar are polymers whose units are connected by amide groups (polyamides); these linkages are easily formed, confer structural rigidity, and resist hydrolysis. Amides include many other important biological compounds, as well as many drugs like paracetamol, penicillin and LSD. Low-molecular-weight amides, such as dimethylformamide, are common solvents.

==Structure and bonding==

The lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom is delocalized into the Carbonyl group, thus forming a partial double bond between nitrogen and carbon. In fact the O, C and N atoms have molecular orbitals occupied by delocalized electrons, forming a conjugated system. Consequently, the three bonds of the nitrogen in amides is not pyramidal (as in the amines) but planar. This planar restriction prevents rotations about the N linkage and thus has important consequences for the mechanical properties of bulk material of such molecules, and also for the configurational properties of macromolecules built by such bonds. The inability to rotate distinguishes amide groups from ester groups which allow rotation and thus create more flexible bulk material.

The C-C(O)NR2 core of amides is planar. The C=O distance is shorter than the C-N distance by almost 10%. The structure of an amide can be described also as a resonance between two alternative structures: neutral (A) and zwitterionic (B).

It is estimated that for acetamide, structure A makes a 62% contribution to the structure, while structure B makes a 28% contribution (these figures do not sum to 100% because there are additional less-important resonance forms that are not depicted above). There is also a hydrogen bond present between the hydrogen and nitrogen atoms in the active groups. Resonance is largely prevented in the very strained quinuclidone.
In their IR spectra, amides exhibit a moderately intense &quot;ν&quot;CO band near 1650 cm−1. The energy of this band is about 60 cm−1 lower than for the &quot;ν&quot;CO of esters and ketones. This difference reflects the contribution of the zwitterionic resonance structure.

===Basicity===
Compared to amines, amides are very weak bases. While the conjugate acid of an amine has a p&quot;K&quot;a of about 9.5, the conjugate acid of an amide has a p&quot;K&quot;a around −0.5. Therefore, compared to amines, amides do not have acid–base properties that are as noticeable in water. This relative lack of basicity is explained by the withdrawing of electrons from the amine by the carbonyl. On the other hand, amides are much stronger bases than carboxylic acids, esters, aldehydes, and ketones (their conjugate acids&#x27; p&quot;K&quot;as are between −6 and −10).

The proton of a primary or secondary amide does not dissociate readily; its p&quot;K&quot;a is usually well above 15. Conversely, under extremely acidic conditions, the carbonyl oxygen can become protonated with a p&quot;K&quot;a of roughly −1. It is not only because of the positive charge on the nitrogen but also because of the negative charge on the oxygen gained through resonance.

===Hydrogen bonding and solubility===
Because of the greater electronegativity of oxygen than nitrogen, the carbonyl (C=O) is a stronger dipole than the N–C dipole. The presence of a C=O dipole and, to a lesser extent a N–C dipole, allows amides to act as H-bond acceptors. In primary and secondary amides, the presence of N–H dipoles allows amides to function as H-bond donors as well. Thus amides can participate in hydrogen bonding with water and other protic solvents; the oxygen atom can accept hydrogen bonds from water and the N–H hydrogen atoms can donate H-bonds. As a result of interactions such as these, the water solubility of amides is greater than that of corresponding hydrocarbons. These hydrogen bonds also have an important role in the secondary structure of proteins.

The solubilities of amides and esters are roughly comparable. Typically amides are less soluble than comparable amines and carboxylic acids since these compounds can both donate and accept hydrogen bonds. Tertiary amides, with the important exception of &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dimethylformamide, exhibit low solubility in water.

==Reactions ==
Amides do not readily participate in nucleophilic substitution reactions. Amides are stable to water, and are roughly 100 times more stable towards hydrolysis than esters. Amides can, however, be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids in the presence of acid or base. The stability of amide bonds has biological implications, since the amino acids that make up proteins are linked with amide bonds. Amide bonds are resistant enough to hydrolysis to maintain protein structure in aqueous environments but are susceptible to catalyzed hydrolysis.

Primary and secondary amides do not react usefully with carbon nucleophiles. Instead, Grignard reagents and organolithiums deprotonate an amide N-H bond. Tertiary amides do not experience this problem, and react with carbon nucleophiles to give ketones; the amide anion (NR2−) is a very strong base and thus a very poor leaving group, so nucleophilic attack only occurs once. When reacted with carbon nucleophiles, &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dimethylformamide (DMF) can be used to introduce a formyl group.

Here, phenyllithium 1 attacks the carbonyl group of DMF 2, giving tetrahedral intermediate 3. Because the dimethylamide anion is a poor leaving group, the intermediate does not collapse and another nucleophilic addition does not occur. Upon acidic workup, the alkoxide is protonated to give 4, then the amine is protonated to give 5. Elimination of a neutral molecule of dimethylamine and loss of a proton give benzaldehyde, 6.

===Hydrolysis===
Amides hydrolyse in hot alkali as well as in strong acidic conditions. Acidic conditions yield the carboxylic acid and the ammonium ion while basic hydrolysis yield the carboxylate ion and ammonia. The protonation of the initially generated amine under acidic conditions and the deprotonation of the initially generated carboxylic acid under basic conditions render these processes non-catalytic and irreversible. Electrophiles other than protons react with the carbonyl oxygen. This step often precedes hydrolysis, which is catalyzed by both Brønsted acids and Lewis acids. Peptidase enzymes and some synthetic catalysts often operate by attachment of electrophiles to the carbonyl oxygen.

==Synthesis==
===From carboxylic acids and related compounds===
Amides are usually prepared by coupling a carboxylic acid with an amine. The direct reaction generally requires high temperatures to drive off the water:
:

Esters are far superior substrates relative to carboxylic acids.

Further &quot;activating&quot; both acid chlorides (Schotten-Baumann reaction) and anhydrides (Lumière–Barbier method) react with amines to give amides:
:

Peptide synthesis use coupling agents such as HATU, HOBt, or PyBOP.

===From nitriles===
The hydrolysis of nitriles is conducted on an industrial scale to produce fatty amides. Laboratory procedures are also available.

===Specialty routes===
Many specialized methods also yield amides. A variety of reagents, e.g. tris(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) borate have been developed for specialized applications.

<doc id="1423" wikidata="Q43004" url="?curid=1423" title="Animism">
<text>Animism (from meaning &#x27;breath, spirit, life&#x27;) is the belief that objects, places, and creatures all possess a distinct spiritual essence. Animism perceives all things—animals, plants, rocks, rivers, weather systems, human handiwork, and in some cases words—as being animated, having agency and free will. Animism is used in anthropology of religion as a term for the belief system of many Indigenous peoples in contrast to the relatively more recent development of organized religions. Animism is a metaphysical belief which focuses on the supernatural universe: specifically, on the concept of the immaterial soul.

Although each culture has its own mythologies and rituals, animism is said to describe the most common, foundational thread of indigenous peoples&#x27; &quot;spiritual&quot; or &quot;supernatural&quot; perspectives. The animistic perspective is so widely held and inherent to most indigenous peoples that they often do not even have a word in their languages that corresponds to &quot;animism&quot; (or even &quot;religion&quot;). The term &quot;animism&quot; is an anthropological construct.

Largely due to such ethnolinguistic and cultural discrepancies, opinions differ on whether animism refers to an ancestral mode of experience common to indigenous peoples around the world or to a full-fledged religion in its own right. The currently accepted definition of animism was only developed in the late 19th century (1871) by Edward Tylor. It is &quot;one of anthropology&#x27;s earliest concepts, if not the first.&quot;

Animism encompasses beliefs that all material phenomena have agency, that there exists no categorical distinction between the spiritual and physical world, and that soul, spirit, or sentience exists not only in humans but also in other animals, plants, rocks, geographic features (such as mountains and rivers), and other entities of the natural environment. Examples include water sprites, vegetation deities, and tree spirits, among others. Animism may further attribute a life force to abstract concepts such as words, true names, or metaphors in mythology. Some members of the non-tribal world also consider themselves animists, such as author Daniel Quinn, sculptor Lawson Oyekan, and many contemporary Pagans.

== Etymology ==
English anthropologist Sir Edward Tylor initially wanted to describe the phenomenon as spiritualism, but he realized that it would cause confusion with the modern religion of spiritualism, which was then prevalent across Western nations. He adopted the term animism from the writings of German scientist Georg Ernst Stahl, who had developed the term &quot;&quot; in 1708 as a biological theory that souls formed the vital principle, and that the normal phenomena of life and the abnormal phenomena of disease could be traced to spiritual causes.

The origin of the word comes from the Latin word , which means &quot;life&quot; or &quot;soul.&quot;

The first known usage in English appeared in 1819.

== &quot;Old animism&quot; definitions ==
Earlier anthropological perspectives, which have since been termed the old animism, were concerned with knowledge on what is alive and what factors make something alive. The old animism assumed that animists were individuals who were unable to understand the difference between persons and things. Critics of the old animism have accused it of preserving &quot;colonialist and dualistic worldviews and rhetoric.&quot;

=== Edward Tylor&#x27;s definition ===
The idea of animism was developed by anthropologist Sir Edward Tylor through his 1871 book &quot;Primitive Culture&quot;, in which he defined it as &quot;the general doctrine of souls and other spiritual beings in general.&quot; According to Tylor, animism often includes &quot;an idea of pervading life and will in nature;&quot; a belief that natural objects other than humans have souls. This formulation was little different from that proposed by Auguste Comte as &quot;fetishism&quot;, but the terms now have distinct meanings.

For Tylor, animism represented the earliest form of religion, being situated within an evolutionary framework of religion that has developed in stages and which will ultimately lead to humanity rejecting religion altogether in favor of scientific rationality. Thus, for Tylor, animism was fundamentally seen as a mistake, a basic error from which all religions grew. He did not believe that animism was inherently illogical, but he suggested that it arose from early humans&#x27; dreams and visions and thus was a rational system. However, it was based on erroneous, unscientific observations about the nature of reality. Stringer notes that his reading of &quot;Primitive Culture&quot; led him to believe that Tylor was far more sympathetic in regard to &quot;primitive&quot; populations than many of his contemporaries and that Tylor expressed no belief that there was any difference between the intellectual capabilities of &quot;savage&quot; people and Westerners.

The idea that there had once been &quot;one universal form of primitive religion&quot; (whether labelled &quot;animism&quot;, &quot;totemism&quot;, or &quot;shamanism&quot;) has been dismissed as &quot;unsophisticated&quot; and &quot;erroneous&quot; by archaeologist Timothy Insoll, who stated that &quot;it removes complexity, a precondition of religion now, in &quot;all&quot; its variants.&quot;

=== Social evolutionist conceptions ===
Tylor&#x27;s definition of animism was part of a growing international debate on the nature of &quot;primitive society&quot; by lawyers, theologians, and philologists. The debate defined the field of research of a new science: &quot;anthropology&quot;. By the end of the 19th century, an orthodoxy on &quot;primitive society&quot; had emerged, but few anthropologists still would accept that definition. The &quot;19th-century armchair anthropologists&quot; argued that &quot;primitive society&quot; (an evolutionary category) was ordered by kinship and divided into exogamous descent groups related by a series of marriage exchanges. Their religion was animism, the belief that natural species and objects had souls.

With the development of private property, the descent groups were displaced by the emergence of the territorial state. These rituals and beliefs eventually evolved over time into the vast array of &quot;developed&quot; religions. According to Tylor, as society became more scientifically advanced, fewer members of that society would believe in animism. However, any remnant ideologies of souls or spirits, to Tylor, represented &quot;survivals&quot; of the original animism of early humanity.

=== Confounding animism with totemism ===
In 1869 (three years after Tylor proposed his definition of animism), Edinburgh lawyer John Ferguson McLennan, argued that the animistic thinking evident in fetishism gave rise to a religion he named &quot;totemism&quot;. Primitive people believed, he argued, that they were descended from the same species as their totemic animal. Subsequent debate by the &quot;armchair anthropologists&quot; (including J. J. Bachofen, Émile Durkheim, and Sigmund Freud) remained focused on totemism rather than animism, with few directly challenging Tylor&#x27;s definition. Anthropologists &quot;have commonly avoided the issue of animism and even the term itself, rather than revisit this prevalent notion in light of their new and rich ethnographies.&quot;

According to anthropologist Tim Ingold, animism shares similarities with totemism but differs in its focus on individual spirit beings which help to perpetuate life, whereas totemism more typically holds that there is a primary source, such as the land itself or the ancestors, who provide the basis to life. Certain indigenous religious groups such as the Australian Aboriginals are more typically totemic in their worldview, whereas others like the Inuit are more typically animistic.

From his studies into child development, Jean Piaget suggested that children were born with an innate animist worldview in which they anthropomorphized inanimate objects and that it was only later that they grew out of this belief. Conversely, from her ethnographic research, Margaret Mead argued the opposite, believing that children were not born with an animist worldview but that they became acculturated to such beliefs as they were educated by their society.

Stewart Guthrie saw animism—or &quot;attribution&quot; as he preferred it—as an evolutionary strategy to aid survival. He argued that both humans and other animal species view inanimate objects as potentially alive as a means of being constantly on guard against potential threats. His suggested explanation, however, did not deal with the question of why such a belief became central to the religion. In 2000, Guthrie suggested that the &quot;most widespread&quot; concept of animism was that it was the &quot;attribution of spirits to natural phenomena such as stones and trees.&quot;

==&quot;New animism&quot; non-archaic definitions ==
Many anthropologists ceased using the term &quot;animism&quot;, deeming it to be too close to early anthropological theory and religious polemic. However, the term had also been claimed by religious groups—namely, Indigenous communities and nature worshippers—who felt that it aptly described their own beliefs, and who in some cases actively identified as &quot;animists.&quot; It was thus readopted by various scholars, who began using the term in a different way, placing the focus on knowing how to behave toward other beings, some of whom are not human. As religious studies scholar Graham Harvey stated, while the &quot;old animist&quot; definition had been problematic, the term &quot;animism&quot; was nevertheless &quot;of considerable value as a critical, academic term for a style of religious and cultural relating to the world.&quot;

=== Hallowell and the Ojibwe ===

The &quot;new animism&quot; emerged largely from the publications of anthropologist Irving Hallowell, produced on the basis of his ethnographic research among the Ojibwe communities of Canada in the mid-20th century. For the Ojibwe encountered by Hallowell, &quot;personhood&quot; did not require human-likeness, but rather humans were perceived as being like other persons, who for instance included rock persons and bear persons. For the Ojibwe, these persons were each willful beings, who gained meaning and power through their interactions with others; through respectfully interacting with other persons, they themselves learned to &quot;act as a person&quot;.

Hallowell&#x27;s approach to the understanding of Ojibwe personhood differed strongly from prior anthropological concepts of animism. He emphasized the need to challenge the modernist, Western perspectives of what a person is, by entering into a dialogue with different worldwide views. Hallowell&#x27;s approach influenced the work of anthropologist Nurit Bird-David, who produced a scholarly article reassessing the idea of animism in 1999. Seven comments from other academics were provided in the journal, debating Bird-David&#x27;s ideas.

=== Postmodern anthropology ===
More recently, postmodern anthropologists are increasingly engaging with the concept of animism. Modernism is characterized by a Cartesian subject-object dualism that divides the subjective from the objective, and culture from nature. In the modernist view, animism is the inverse of scientism, and hence, is deemed inherently invalid by some anthropologists. Drawing on the work of Bruno Latour, some anthropologists question modernist assumptions and theorize that all societies continue to &quot;animate&quot; the world around them. In contrast to Tylor&#x27;s reasoning, however, this &quot;animism&quot; is considered to be more than just a remnant of primitive thought. More specifically, the &quot;animism&quot; of modernity is characterized by humanity&#x27;s &quot;professional subcultures&quot;, as in the ability to treat the world as a detached entity within a delimited sphere of activity.

Human beings continue to create personal relationships with elements of the aforementioned objective world, such as pets, cars, or teddy bears, which are recognized as subjects. As such, these entities are &quot;approached as communicative subjects rather than the inert objects perceived by modernists.&quot; These approaches aim to avoid the modernist assumption that the environment consists of a physical world distinct from the world of humans, as well as the modernist conception of the person being composed dualistically of a body and a soul.

Nurit Bird-David argues that:

She explains that animism is a &quot;relational epistemology&quot; rather than a failure of primitive reasoning. That is, self-identity among animists is based on their relationships with others, rather than any distinctive features of the &quot;self&quot;. Instead of focusing on the essentialized, modernist self (the &quot;individual&quot;), persons are viewed as bundles of social relationships (&quot;dividuals&quot;), some of which include &quot;superpersons&quot; (i.e. non-humans).
Stewart Guthrie expressed criticism of Bird-David&#x27;s attitude towards animism, believing that it promulgated the view that &quot;the world is in large measure whatever our local imagination makes it.&quot; This, he felt, would result in anthropology abandoning &quot;the scientific project.&quot;

Like Bird-David, Tim Ingold argues that animists do not see themselves as separate from their environment:

Rane Willerslev extends the argument by noting that animists reject this Cartesian dualism and that the animist self identifies with the world, &quot;feeling at once &quot;within&quot; and &quot;apart&quot; from it so that the two glide ceaselessly in and out of each other in a sealed circuit&quot;. The animist hunter is thus aware of himself as a human hunter, but, through mimicry, is able to assume the viewpoint, senses, and sensibilities of his prey, to be one with it. Shamanism, in this view, is an everyday attempt to influence spirits of ancestors and animals, by mirroring their behaviors, as the hunter does its prey.

=== Ethical and ecological understanding ===
Cultural ecologist and philosopher David Abram proposed an ethical and ecological understanding of animism, grounded in the phenomenology of sensory experience. In his books &quot;The Spell of the Sensuous&quot; and &quot;Becoming Animal,&quot; Abram suggests that material things are never entirely passive in our direct perceptual experience, holding rather that perceived things actively &quot;solicit our attention&quot; or &quot;call our focus&quot;, coaxing the perceiving body into an ongoing participation with those things.

In the absence of intervening technologies, he suggests that sensory experience is inherently animistic in that it discloses a material field that is animate and self-organizing from the beginning. David Abram used contemporary cognitive and natural science, as well as the perspectival worldviews of diverse indigenous oral cultures, to propose a richly pluralist and story-based cosmology in which matter is alive. He suggested that such a relational ontology is in close accord with humanity&#x27;s spontaneous perceptual experience by drawing attention to the senses, and to the primacy of sensuous terrain, enjoining a more respectful and ethical relation to the more-than-human community of animals, plants, soils, mountains, waters, and weather-patterns that materially sustains humanity.

In contrast to a long-standing tendency in the Western social sciences, which commonly provide rational explanations of animistic experience, Abram develops an animistic account of reason itself. He holds that civilised reason is sustained only by intensely animistic participation between human beings and their own written signs. For instance, as soon as someone reads letters on a page or screen, they can &quot;see what it says&quot;—the letters speak as much as nature spoke to pre-literate peoples. Reading can usefully be understood as an intensely concentrated form of animism, one that effectively eclipses all of the other, older, more spontaneous forms of animistic participation in which humans were once engaged.

=== Relation to the concept of &#x27;I-thou&#x27; ===
Religious studies scholar Graham Harvey defined &quot;animism&quot; as the belief &quot;that the world is full of persons, only some of whom are human, and that life is always lived in relationship with others.&quot; He added that it is therefore &quot;concerned with learning how to be a good person in respectful relationships with other persons.&quot;

In his &quot;Handbook of Contemporary Animism&quot; (2013), Harvey identifies the animist perspective in line with Martin Buber&#x27;s &quot;I-thou&quot; as opposed to &quot;I-it&quot;. In such, Harvey says, the animist takes an I-thou approach to relating to the world, whereby objects and animals are treated as a &quot;thou&quot;, rather than as an &quot;it&quot;.

== Religion ==
There is ongoing disagreement (and no general consensus) as to whether animism is merely a singular, broadly encompassing religious belief or a worldview in and of itself, comprising many diverse mythologies found worldwide in many diverse cultures. This also raises a controversy regarding the ethical claims animism may or may not make: whether animism ignores questions of ethics altogether; or, by endowing various non-human elements of nature with spirituality or personhood, it in fact promotes a complex ecological ethics.

=== Concepts ===

==== Distinction from pantheism ====
Animism is not the same as pantheism, although the two are sometimes confused. Moreover, some religions are both pantheistic and animistic. One of the main differences is that while animists believe everything to be spiritual in nature, they do not necessarily see the spiritual nature of everything in existence as being united (monism) the way pantheists do. As a result, animism puts more emphasis on the uniqueness of each individual soul. In pantheism, everything shares the same spiritual essence, rather than having distinct spirits or souls. For example, Giordano Bruno equated the world soul with God and espoused a pantheistic animism.

==== Fetishism / totemism ====
In many animistic world views, the human being is often regarded as on a roughly equal footing with other animals, plants, and natural forces.

=== African indigenous religions ===
Traditional African religions: most religious traditions of Sub-Saharan Africa are basically a complex form of animism with polytheistic and shamanistic elements and ancestor worship.

In East Africa the Kerma culture display Animistic elements similar to other Traditional African religions. In contrast, the later polytheistic Napatan and Meroitic periods, with displays of animals in Amulets and the esteemed antiques of Lions, appear to be an Animistic culture rather than a polytheistic culture. The Kermans likely treated Jebel Barkal as a special sacred site, and passed it on to the Kushites and Egyptians who venerated the mesa.

In North Africa, the traditional Berber religion includes the traditional polytheistic, animist, and in some rare cases, shamanistic, religions of the Berber people.

=== Asian origin religions ===
==== Indian-origin religions ====
In the Indian-origin religions, namely Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism, the animistic aspects of nature worship and ecological conservation are part of the core belief system.

Matsya Purana, a Hindu text, has a Sanskrit language shloka (hymn), which explains the importance of reverence of ecology. It states: &quot;A pond equals ten wells, a reservoir equals ten ponds, while a son equals ten reservoirs, and a tree equals ten sons.&quot; Indian religions worship trees such as the Bodhi Tree and numerous superlative banyan trees, conserve the sacred groves of India, revere the rivers as sacred, and worship the mountains and their ecology.

Panchavati are the sacred trees in Indic religions, which are sacred groves containing five type of trees, usually chosen from among the Vata (&quot;Ficus benghalensis&quot;, Banyan), Ashvattha (&quot;Ficus religiosa&quot;, Peepal), Bilva (&quot;Aegle marmelos&quot;, Bengal Quince), Amalaki (&quot;Phyllanthus emblica&quot;, Indian Gooseberry, Amla), Ashoka (&quot;Saraca asoca&quot;, Ashok), Udumbara (&quot;Ficus racemosa&quot;, Cluster Fig, Gular), Nimba (&quot;Azadirachta indica&quot;, Neem) and Shami (&quot;Prosopis spicigera&quot;, Indian Mesquite).

The banyan is considered holy in several religious traditions of India. The &quot;Ficus benghalensis&quot; is the national tree of India. Vat Purnima is a Hindu festival related to the banyan tree, and is observed by married women in North India and in the Western Indian states of Maharashtra, Goa, Gujarat. For three days of the month of Jyeshtha in the Hindu calendar (which falls in May–June in the Gregorian calendar) married women observe a fast, tie threads around a banyan tree, and pray for the well-being of their husbands. Thimmamma Marrimanu, sacred to Indian religions, has branches spread over five acres and was listed as the world&#x27;s largest banyan tree in the Guinness World Records in 1989.

In Hinduism, the leaf of the banyan tree is said to be the resting place for the god Krishna. In the Bhagavat Gita, Krishna said, &quot;There is a banyan tree which has its roots upward and its branches down, and the Vedic hymns are its leaves. One who knows this tree is the knower of the Vedas.&quot; (Bg 15.1)

In Buddhism&#x27;s Pali canon, the banyan (Pali: &quot;nigrodha&quot;) is referenced numerous times. Typical metaphors allude to the banyan&#x27;s epiphytic nature, likening the banyan&#x27;s supplanting of a host tree as comparable to the way sensual desire (&quot;kāma&quot;) overcomes humans.

Mun (also known as Munism or Bongthingism) is the traditional polytheistic, animist, shamanistic, and syncretic religion of the Lepcha people.

Sanamahism is an ethnic religion of the Meitei people of in Northeast India. It is a polytheistic and animist religion and is named after Lainingthou Sanamahi, one of the most important deities of the Meitei faith.

==== Chinese religions ====
Shendao () is a term originated by Chinese folk religions influenced by, Mohist, Confucian and Taoist philosophy, referring to the divine order of nature or the Wuxing.

The Shang dynasty&#x27;s state religion was practiced from 1600 BCE to 1046 BCE, and was built on the idea of spiritualizing natural phenomena.

==== Japan and Shinto ====
Shinto is the traditional Japanese folk religion and has many animist aspects. The , a class of supernatural beings, are central to Shinto. All things, including natural forces and well-known geographical locations, are thought to be home to the kami. The kami are worshipped at kamidana household shrines, family shrines, and jinja public shrines.

The Ryukyuan religion of the Ryukyu Islands is distinct from Shinto, but shares similar characteristics.

==== Kalash people ====
Kalash people of Northern Pakistan follow an ancient animistic religion identified with an ancient form of Hinduism.

The Kalash (Kalasha: , romanised: , Devanagari: ), or Kalasha, are an Indo-Aryan indigenous people residing in the Chitral District of the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan.

They are considered unique among the people of Pakistan. They are also considered to be Pakistan&#x27;s smallest ethnoreligious group, and traditionally practice what authors characterise as a form of animism. During the mid-20th century an attempt was made to force a few Kalasha villages in Pakistan to convert to Islam, but the people fought the conversion and, once official pressure was removed, the vast majority resumed the practice of their own religion. Nevertheless, some Kalasha have since converted to Islam, despite being shunned afterward by their community for having done so.

The term is used to refer to many distinct people including the Väi, the Čima-nišei, the Vântä, plus the Ashkun- and Tregami-speakers. The Kalash are considered to be an indigenous people of Asia, with their ancestors migrating to Chitral Valley from another location possibly further south, which the Kalash call &quot;Tsiyam&quot; in their folk songs and epics.

They claim to descend from the armies of Alexander who were left behind from his armed campaign, though no evidence exists for him to have passed the area. 

The neighbouring Nuristani people of the adjacent Nuristan (historically known as Kafiristan) province of Afghanistan once had the same culture and practised a faith very similar to that of the Kalash, differing in a few minor particulars.

The first historically recorded Islamic invasions of their lands were by the Ghaznavids in the 11th century while they themselves are first attested in 1339 during Timur&#x27;s invasions. Nuristan had been forcibly converted to Islam in 1895–96, although some evidence has shown the people continued to practice their customs. The Kalash of Chitral have maintained their own separate cultural traditions.

==== Korea ====
Muism, the native Korean belief, has many animist aspects. The various deities, called &quot;kwisin,&quot; are capable of interacting with humans and causing problems if they are not honoured appropriately. 

==== Philippines indigenous religions ====
In the indigenous Philippine folk religions, pre-colonial religions of Philippines and Philippine mythology, animism is part of their core beliefs as demonstrated by the belief in Anito and Bathala as well as their conservation and veneration of sacred Indigenous Philippine shrines, forests, mountains and sacred grounds.

Anito (lit. &#x27;[ancestor] spirit&#x27;) refers to the various indigenous shamanistic folk religions of the Philippines, led by female or feminized male shamans known as &quot;babaylan&quot;. It includes belief in a spirit world existing alongside and interacting with the material world, as well as the belief that everything has a spirit, from rocks and trees to animals and humans to natural phenomena.

In indigenous Filipino belief, the Bathala is the omnipotent deity which was derived from Sanskrit word for the Hindu supreme deity &quot;bhattara&quot;, as one of the ten avatars of the Hindu god Vishnu. The omnipotent Bathala also presides over the spirits of ancestors called Anito. Anitos serve as intermediaries between mortals and the divine, such as Agni (Hindu) who holds the access to divine realms; for this reason they are invoked first and are the first to receive offerings, regardless of the deity the worshipper wants to pray to.

==== Abrahamic religions ====
Animism also has influences in Abrahamic religions.

The Old Testament and the Wisdom literature preach the omnipresence of God (Jeremiah 23:24; Proverbs 15:3; 1 Kings 8:27), and God is bodily present in the incarnation of his Son, Jesus Christ. (Gospel of John 1:14, Colossians 2:9). Animism is not peripheral to Christian identity but is its nurturing home ground, its axis mundi. In addition to the conceptual work the term &quot;animism&quot; performs, it provides insight into the relational character and common personhood of material existence.

The Christian spiritual mapping movement is based upon a similar worldview to that of animism. It involves researching and mapping the spiritual and social history of an area in order to determine the demon (territorial spirit) controlling an area and preventing evangelism, so that the demon can be defeated through spiritual warfare prayer and rituals. Both posit that an invisible spirit world is active and that it can be interacted with or controlled, with the Christian belief that such power to control the spirit world comes from God rather than being inherent to objects or places. &quot;The animist believes that rituals and objects &quot;contain&quot; spiritual power, whereas a Christian believes that rituals and objects may &quot;convey&quot; power. Animists seek to &quot;manipulate&quot; power, whereas Christians seek to &quot;submit&quot; to God and to learn to work with his power.&quot;

With rising awareness of ecological preservation, recently theologians like Mark I. Wallace argue for animistic Christianity with a biocentric approach that understands God being present in all earthly objects, such as animals, trees, and rocks.

==== Pre-Islamic Arab religion ====
Pre-Islamic Arab religion can refer to the traditional polytheistic, animist, and in some rare cases, shamanistic, religions of the peoples of the Arabian Peninsula. The belief in jinn, invisible entities akin to spirits in the Western sense dominant in the Arab religious systems, hardly fit the description of Animism in a strict sense. The jinn are considered to be analogous to the human soul by living lives like that of humans, but they are not exactly like human souls neither are they spirits of the dead. It is unclear if belief in jinn derived from nomadic or sedentary populations.

=== New religious movements ===
Some modern pagan groups, including Eco-pagans, describe themselves as animists, meaning that they respect the diverse community of living beings and spirits with whom humans share the world and cosmos.

The New Age movement commonly demonstrates animistic traits in asserting the existence of nature spirits.

=== Shamanism ===
A shaman is a person regarded as having access to, and influence in, the world of benevolent and malevolent spirits, who typically enters into a trance state during a ritual, and practices divination and healing.

According to Mircea Eliade, shamanism encompasses the premise that shamans are intermediaries or messengers between the human world and the spirit worlds. Shamans are said to treat ailments and illnesses by mending the soul. Alleviating traumas affecting the soul or spirit restores the physical body of the individual to balance and wholeness. The shaman also enters supernatural realms or dimensions to obtain solutions to problems afflicting the community. Shamans may visit other worlds or dimensions to bring guidance to misguided souls and to ameliorate illnesses of the human soul caused by foreign elements. The shaman operates primarily within the spiritual world, which in turn affects the human world. The restoration of balance results in the elimination of the ailment.

Abram, however, articulates a less supernatural and much more ecological understanding of the shaman&#x27;s role than that propounded by Eliade. Drawing upon his own field research in Indonesia, Nepal, and the Americas, Abram suggests that in animistic cultures, the shaman functions primarily as an intermediary between the human community and the more-than-human community of active agencies—the local animals, plants, and landforms (mountains, rivers, forests, winds, and weather patterns, all of which are felt to have their own specific sentience). Hence, the shaman&#x27;s ability to heal individual instances of disease (or imbalance) within the human community is a byproduct of their more continual practice of balancing the reciprocity between the human community and the wider collective of animate beings in which that community is embedded.

== Animist life ==

=== Non-human animals ===
Animism entails the belief that all living things have a soul, and thus, a central concern of animist thought surrounds how animals can be eaten, or otherwise used for humans&#x27; subsistence needs. The actions of non-human animals are viewed as &quot;intentional, planned and purposive&quot;, and they are understood to be persons, as they are both alive, and communicate with others.

In animist worldviews, non-human animals are understood to participate in kinship systems and ceremonies with humans, as well as having their own kinship systems and ceremonies. Graham Harvey cited an example of an animist understanding of animal behavior that occurred at a powwow held by the Conne River Mi&#x27;kmaq in 1996; an eagle flew over the proceedings, circling over the central drum group. The assembled participants called out (&#x27;eagle&#x27;), conveying welcome to the bird and expressing pleasure at its beauty, and they later articulated the view that the eagle&#x27;s actions reflected its approval of the event, and the Mi&#x27;kmaq&#x27;s return to traditional spiritual practices.

In animism, rituals are performed to maintain relationships between humans and spirits. Indigenous peoples often perform these rituals to appease the spirits and request their assistance during activities such as hunting and healing. In the Arctic region, certain rituals are common before the hunt as a means to show respect for the spirits of animals.

=== Flora ===
Some animists also view plant and fungi life as persons and interact with them accordingly. The most common encounter between humans and these plant and fungi persons is with the former&#x27;s collection of the latter for food, and for animists, this interaction typically has to be carried out respectfully. Harvey cited the example of Māori communities in New Zealand, who often offer &quot;karakia&quot; invocations to sweet potatoes as they dig up the latter. While doing so, there is an awareness of a kinship relationship between the Māori and the sweet potatoes, with both understood as having arrived in Aotearoa together in the same canoes.

In other instances, animists believe that interaction with plant and fungi persons can result in the communication of things unknown or even otherwise unknowable. Among some modern Pagans, for instance, relationships are cultivated with specific trees, who are understood to bestow knowledge or physical gifts, such as flowers, sap, or wood that can be used as firewood or to fashion into a wand; in return, these Pagans give offerings to the tree itself, which can come in the form of libations of mead or ale, a drop of blood from a finger, or a strand of wool.

=== The elements ===
Various animistic cultures also comprehend stones as persons. Discussing ethnographic work conducted among the Ojibwe, Harvey noted that their society generally conceived of stones as being inanimate, but with two notable exceptions: the stones of the Bell Rocks and those stones which are situated beneath trees struck by lightning, which were understood to have become Thunderers themselves. The Ojibwe conceived of weather as being capable of having personhood, with storms being conceived of as persons known as &#x27;Thunderers&#x27; whose sounds conveyed communications and who engaged in seasonal conflict over the lakes and forests, throwing lightning at lake monsters. Wind, similarly, can be conceived as a person in animistic thought.

The importance of place is also a recurring element of animism, with some places being understood to be persons in their own right.

=== Spirits ===
Animism can also entail relationships being established with non-corporeal spirit entities.

== Other usage ==

=== Science ===
In the early 20th century, William McDougall defended a form of animism in his book &quot;Body and Mind: A History and Defence of Animism&quot; (1911).

Physicist Nick Herbert has argued for &quot;quantum animism&quot; in which the mind permeates the world at every level:

Werner Krieglstein wrote regarding his &quot;quantum Animism&quot;:

In &quot;Error and Loss: A Licence to Enchantment&quot;, Ashley Curtis (2018) has argued that the Cartesian idea of an experiencing subject facing off with an inert physical world is incoherent at its very foundation and that this incoherence is consistent with rather than belied by Darwinism. Human reason (and its rigorous extension in the natural sciences) fits an evolutionary niche just as echolocation does for bats and infrared vision does for pit vipers, and is epistemologically on a par with, rather than superior to, such capabilities. The meaning or aliveness of the &quot;objects&quot; we encounter, rocks, trees, rivers, and other animals, thus depends for its validity not on a detached cognitive judgment, but purely on the quality of our experience. The animist experience, or the wolf&#x27;s or raven&#x27;s experience, thus become licensed as equally valid worldviews to the modern western scientific one; they are indeed more valid, since they are not plagued with the incoherence that inevitably arises when &quot;objective existence&quot; is separated from &quot;subjective experience.&quot;

=== Socio-political impact ===
Harvey opined that animism&#x27;s views on personhood represented a radical challenge to the dominant perspectives of modernity, because it accords &quot;intelligence, rationality, consciousness, volition, agency, intentionality, language, and desire&quot; to non-humans. Similarly, it challenges the view of human uniqueness that is prevalent in both Abrahamic religions and Western rationalism.

=== Art and literature ===
Animist beliefs can also be expressed through artwork. For instance, among the Māori communities of New Zealand, there is an acknowledgement that creating art through carving wood or stone entails violence against the wood or stone person and that the persons who are damaged therefore have to be placated and respected during the process; any excess or waste from the creation of the artwork is returned to the land, while the artwork itself is treated with particular respect. Harvey, therefore, argued that the creation of art among the Māori was not about creating an inanimate object for display, but rather a transformation of different persons within a relationship.

Harvey expressed the view that animist worldviews were present in various works of literature, citing such examples as the writings of Alan Garner, Leslie Silko, Barbara Kingsolver, Alice Walker, Daniel Quinn, Linda Hogan, David Abram, Patricia Grace, Chinua Achebe, Ursula Le Guin, Louise Erdrich, and Marge Piercy.

Animist worldviews have also been identified in the animated films of Hayao Miyazaki.

<doc id="1425" wikidata="Q1340" url="?curid=1425" title="Antonio Vivaldi">
<text>Antonio Lucio Vivaldi (4 March 1678 – 28 July 1741) was an Italian composer, virtuoso violinist and impresario of Baroque music. Regarded as one of the greatest Baroque composers, Vivaldi&#x27;s influence during his lifetime was widespread across Europe, giving origin to many imitators and admirers. He pioneered many developments in orchestration, violin technique and programmatic music. He consolidated the emerging concerto form, especially the solo concerto, into a widely accepted and followed idiom.

Vivaldi composed many instrumental concertos, for the violin and a variety of other musical instruments, as well as sacred choral works and more than fifty operas. His best-known work is a series of violin concertos known as &quot;The Four Seasons&quot;. Many of his compositions were written for the all-female music ensemble of the , a home for abandoned children. Vivaldi began studying for the Catholic priesthood at the age of 15 and was ordained at 25, but was given dispensation to no longer say public Masses due to a health problem. Vivaldi also had some success with expensive stagings of his operas in Venice, Mantua and Vienna. After meeting the Emperor Charles VI, Vivaldi moved to Vienna, hoping for royal support. However, the Emperor died soon after Vivaldi&#x27;s arrival, and Vivaldi himself died in poverty less than a year later.

After almost two centuries of decline, Vivaldi&#x27;s musical reputation underwent a revival in the early 20th century, with much scholarly research devoted to his work. Many of Vivaldi&#x27;s compositions, once thought lost, have been rediscovered – some as recently as 2015. His music remains widely popular in the present day and is regularly played all over the world.

==Early life==
===Birth and background===

Antonio Lucio Vivaldi was born on 4 March 1678 in Venice, then the capital of the Republic of Venice. He was son of Giovanni Battista Vivaldi and Camilla Calicchio, as recorded in the register of San Giovanni in Bragora.

He was baptized immediately after his birth at his home by the midwife, the reason for which has led to speculation. It was most likely done due to his poor health. There is a false rumor that an earthquake struck the city that day. This rumor may have originated from an earthquake that struck Venice on 17 April 1688. The baptismal ceremonies which had been omitted were supplied two months later.

Vivaldi had five known siblings: Bonaventura Tomaso, Margarita Gabriela, Cecilia Maria, Francesco Gaetano, and Zanetta Anna. Vivaldi&#x27;s health was problematic. One of his symptoms, (&quot;tightness of the chest&quot;), has been interpreted as a form of asthma. This did not prevent him from learning to play the violin, composing, or taking part in musical activities, although it prevented him from playing wind instruments.

===Youth===
His father, Giovanni Battista, was a barber before becoming a professional violinist and was one of the founders of the , an association of musicians. He taught Antonio to play the violin and then toured Venice, playing the violin with his young son. Antonio was probably taught at an early age, judging by the extensive musical knowledge he had acquired by the age of 24, when he started working at the .

The president of the was Giovanni Legrenzi, an early Baroque composer and the at St Mark&#x27;s Basilica. It is possible that Legrenzi gave the young Antonio his first lessons in composition. Vivaldi&#x27;s father may have been a composer himself: in 1689, an opera titled was composed by a Giovanni Battista Rossi—the name under which Vivaldi&#x27;s father had joined the Sovvegno di Santa Cecilia.In 1691, at the age of thirteen, Vivaldi wrote an early liturgical work – (RV Anh 31).

In 1693, at the age of fifteen, he began studying to become a priest. He was ordained in 1703, aged 25, and was soon nicknamed , &quot;The Red Priest&quot;; is Italian for &quot;red&quot; and would have referred to the color of his hair, a family trait.

==Career==
===Ospedale della Pietà===
Although Vivaldi is most famous as a composer, he was regarded as an exceptional technical violinist as well. The German architect Johann Friedrich Armand von Uffenbach referred to Vivaldi as &quot;the famous composer and violinist&quot; and noted in his diary that &quot;Vivaldi played a solo accompaniment excellently, and at the conclusion he added a free fantasy [an improvised cadenza] which absolutely astounded me, for it is hardly possible that anyone has ever played, or ever will play, in such a fashion.&quot; In September 1703, Vivaldi (24) became (master of violin) at an orphanage called the Pio Ospedale della Pietà (Devout Hospital of Mercy) in Venice; although his talents as a violinist probably secured him the job, he soon became a successful teacher of music there.

Over the next thirty years he composed most of his major works while working at the Ospedale. There were four similar institutions in Venice; their purpose was to give shelter and education to children who were abandoned or orphaned, or whose families could not support them. They were financed by funds provided by the Republic. The boys learned a trade and had to leave when they reached the age of fifteen. The girls received a musical education, and the most talented among them stayed and became members of the Ospedale&#x27;s renowned orchestra and choir.

Shortly after Vivaldi&#x27;s appointment, the orphans began to gain appreciation and esteem abroad, too. Vivaldi wrote concertos, cantatas and sacred vocal music for them. These sacred works, which number over 60, are varied: they included solo motets and large-scale choral works for soloists, double chorus, and orchestra. In 1704, the position of teacher of &quot;viola all&#x27;inglese&quot; was added to his duties as violin instructor. The position of &quot;maestro di coro&quot;, which was at one time filled by Vivaldi, required a lot of time and work. He had to compose an oratorio or concerto for every feast and teach the orphans both music theory and how to play certain instruments.

His relationship with the board of directors of the Ospedale was often strained. The board had to vote every year on whether to keep a teacher. The vote on Vivaldi was seldom unanimous and went 7 to 6 against him in 1709. In 1711, after a year as a freelance musician, he was recalled by the Ospedale with a unanimous vote; clearly during his year&#x27;s absence the board had realized the importance of his role. He became responsible for all of the musical activity of the institution when he was promoted to &quot;maestro de&#x27; concerti&quot; (music director) in 1716 and responsible for composing two new concertos every month.

In 1705, the first collection (&quot;Connor Cassara&quot;) of his works was published by Giuseppe Sala. His Opus 1 is a collection of 12 sonatas for two violins and basso continuo, in a conventional style. In 1709, a second collection of 12 sonatas for violin and basso continuo appeared (Opus 2). A real breakthrough as a composer came with his first collection of 12 concerti for one, two, and four violins with strings, &quot;L&#x27;estro armonico&quot; (Opus 3), which was published in Amsterdam in 1711 by Estienne Roger, and dedicated to Grand Prince Ferdinand of Tuscany. The prince sponsored many musicians, including Alessandro Scarlatti and George Frideric Handel. He was a musician himself, and Vivaldi probably met him in Venice. &quot;L&#x27;estro armonico&quot; was a resounding success all over Europe. It was followed in 1714 by &quot;La stravaganza&quot; (Opus 4), a collection of concerti for solo violin and strings, and dedicated to an old violin student of Vivaldi&#x27;s, the Venetian noble Vettor Dolfin.

In February 1711, Vivaldi and his father traveled to Brescia, where his setting of the Stabat Mater (RV 621) was played as part of a religious festival. The work seems to have been written in haste: the string parts are simple, the music of the first three movements is repeated in the next three, and not all the text is set. Nevertheless, perhaps in part because of the forced essentiality of the music, the work is considered to be one of his early masterpieces.

Despite his frequent travels from 1718, the Ospedale paid him 2 sequins to write two concerti a month for the orchestra and to rehearse with them at least five times when in Venice. The orphanage&#x27;s records show that he was paid for 140 concerti between 1723 and 1733.

===Opera impresario===

In early 18th-century Venice, opera was the most popular musical entertainment. It proved most profitable for Vivaldi. There were several theaters competing for the public&#x27;s attention. Vivaldi started his career as an opera composer as a sideline: his first opera, &quot;Ottone in villa&quot; (RV 729) was performed not in Venice, but at the Garzerie Theater in Vicenza in 1713. The following year, Vivaldi became the impresario of the Teatro San Angelo in Venice, where his opera &quot;Orlando finto pazzo&quot; (RV 727) was performed. The work was not to the public&#x27;s taste, and it closed after a couple of weeks, being replaced with a repeat of a different work already given the previous year.

In 1715, he presented &quot;Nerone fatto Cesare&quot; (RV 724, now lost), with music by seven different composers, of which he was the leader. The opera contained eleven arias and was a success. In the late season, Vivaldi planned to put on an opera entirely of his own creation, &quot;Arsilda, regina di Ponto&quot; (RV 700), but the state censor blocked the performance. The main character, Arsilda, falls in love with another woman, Lisea, who is pretending to be a man. Vivaldi got the censor to accept the opera the following year, and it was a resounding success.

During this period, the &quot;Pietà&quot; commissioned several liturgical works. The most important were two oratorios. &quot;Moyses Deus Pharaonis&quot;, (RV 643) is now lost. The second, &quot;Juditha triumphans&quot; (RV 644), celebrates the victory of the Republic of Venice against the Turks and the recapture of the island of Corfu. Composed in 1716, it is one of his sacred masterpieces. All eleven singing parts were performed by girls of the orphanage, both the female and male roles. Many of the arias include parts for solo instruments—recorders, oboes, violas d&#x27;amore, and mandolins—that showcased the range of talents of the girls.

Also in 1716, Vivaldi wrote and produced two more operas, &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione di Dario&quot; (RV 719) and &quot;La costanza trionfante degli amori e degli odi&quot; (RV 706). The latter was so popular that it was performed two years later, re-edited and retitled &quot;Artabano re dei Parti&quot; (RV 701, now lost). It was also performed in Prague in 1732. In the years that followed, Vivaldi wrote several operas that were performed all over Italy.
His progressive operatic style caused him some trouble with more conservative musicians such as Benedetto Marcello, a magistrate and amateur musician who wrote a pamphlet denouncing Vivaldi and his operas. The pamphlet, &quot;Il teatro alla moda&quot;, attacks the composer even though it does not mention him directly. The cover drawing shows a boat (the San Angelo), on the left end of which stands a little angel wearing a priest&#x27;s hat and playing the violin. The Marcello family claimed ownership of the Teatro San Angelo, and a long legal battle had been fought with the management for its restitution, without success. The obscure text under the engraving mentions non-existent places and names: for example, &quot;ALDIVIVA&quot; is an anagram of &quot;A. Vivaldi&quot;.

In a letter written by Vivaldi to his patron Marchese Bentivoglio in 1737, he makes reference to his &quot;94 operas&quot;. Only about 50 operas by Vivaldi have been discovered, and no other documentation of the remaining operas exists. Although Vivaldi could have been exaggerating, it is plausible that, in his dual role of composer and &quot;impresario&quot;, he might have either written or been responsible for the production of as many as 94 operas—given that his career had by then spanned almost 25 years. Although Vivaldi certainly composed many operas in his time, he never attained the prominence of other great composers such as Alessandro Scarlatti, Johann Adolph Hasse, Leonardo Leo, and Baldassare Galuppi, as evidenced by his inability to keep a production running for an extended period of time in any major opera house.

===Mantua and the&quot; Four Seasons&quot;===

In 1717 or 1718, Vivaldi was offered a prestigious new position as &quot;Maestro di Cappella&quot; of the court of Prince Philip of Hesse-Darmstadt, governor of Mantua, in the northwest of Italy He moved there for three years and produced several operas, among them &quot;Tito Manlio&quot; (RV 738). In 1721, he was in Milan, where he presented the pastoral drama &quot;La Silvia&quot; (RV 734); nine arias from it survive. He visited Milan again the following year with the oratorio &quot;L&#x27;adorazione delli tre re magi al bambino Gesù&quot; (RV 645, now lost). In 1722 he moved to Rome, where he introduced his operas&#x27; new style. The new Pope Benedict XIII invited Vivaldi to play for him. In 1725, Vivaldi returned to Venice, where he produced four operas in the same year.

During this period, Vivaldi wrote the &quot;Four Seasons&quot;, four violin concertos that give musical expression to the seasons of the year. The composition is probably one of his most famous. Although three of the concerti are wholly original, the first, &quot;Spring&quot;, borrows motifs from a Sinfonia in the first act of Vivaldi&#x27;s contemporaneous opera &quot;Il Giustino&quot;. The inspiration for the concertos was probably the countryside around Mantua. They were a revolution in musical conception: in them, Vivaldi represented flowing streams, singing birds (of different species, each specifically characterized), barking dogs, buzzing mosquitoes, crying shepherds, storms, drunken dancers, silent nights, hunting parties from both the hunters&#x27; and the prey&#x27;s point of view, frozen landscapes, ice-skating children, and warming winter fires. Each concerto is associated with a sonnet, possibly by Vivaldi, describing the scenes depicted in the music. They were published as the first four concertos in a collection of twelve, &quot;Il cimento dell&#x27;armonia e dell&#x27;inventione&quot;, Opus 8, published in Amsterdam by Michel-Charles Le Cène in 1725.

During his time in Mantua, Vivaldi became acquainted with an aspiring young singer Anna Tessieri Girò, who would become his student, protégée, and favorite &quot;prima donna&quot;. Anna, along with her older half-sister Paolina, moved in with Vivaldi and regularly accompanied him on his many travels. There was speculation as to the nature of Vivaldi&#x27;s and Girò&#x27;s relationship, but no evidence exists to indicate anything beyond friendship and professional collaboration. Vivaldi, in fact, adamantly denied any romantic relationship with Girò in a letter to his patron Bentivoglio, dated 16 November 1737.

===Late period===
Vivaldi collaborated with choreographer Giovanni Gallo on several of his later operas stage in Venice with Gallo choreographing the ballets found within those works. At the height of his career, he received commissions from European nobility and royalty, some of which were:

* The &quot;serenata&quot; (cantata) &quot;Gloria e Imeneo&quot; (RV 687), which was commissioned in 1725 by the French ambassador to Venice in celebration of the marriage of Louis XV, when Vivaldi was 48 years old.
* The &quot;serenata&quot;, &quot;La Sena festeggiante&quot; (RV 694), written in 1726 and also premiered at the French embassy, to celebrate the birth of the French royal princesses, Henriette and Louise Élisabeth.
* Vivaldi&#x27;s Opus 9, &quot;La cetra&quot;, which was dedicated to Emperor Charles VI. In 1728, Vivaldi met the emperor while the emperor was visiting Trieste to oversee the construction of a new port. Charles VI admired the music of the Red Priest so much that he is said to have spoken more with the composer during their one meeting than he spoke to his ministers in more than two years. He gave Vivaldi the title of knight, a gold medal and an invitation to Vienna. Vivaldi gave Charles a manuscript copy of &quot;La cetra&quot;, a set of concerti almost completely different from the set of the same title published as Opus 9. The printing was probably delayed, forcing Vivaldi to gather an improvised collection for the emperor.
* His opera &quot;Farnace&quot; (RV 711) was presented in 1730; it garnered six revivals. Some of his later operas were created in collaboration with two of Italy&#x27;s major writers of the time. Accompanied by his father, Vivaldi traveled to Vienna and Prague in 1730.
* &quot;L&#x27;Olimpiade&quot; and &quot;Catone in Utica&quot; were written by Pietro Metastasio, the major representative of the Arcadian movement and court poet in Vienna. &quot;La Griselda&quot; was rewritten by the young Carlo Goldoni from an earlier libretto by Apostolo Zeno.

Like many composers of the time, Vivaldi faced financial difficulties in his later years. His compositions were no longer held in such high esteem as they had once been in Venice; changing musical tastes quickly made them outmoded. In response, Vivaldi chose to sell off sizeable numbers of his manuscripts at paltry prices to finance his migration to Vienna. The reasons for Vivaldi&#x27;s departure from Venice are unclear, but it seems likely that, after the success of his meeting with Emperor Charles VI, he wished to take up the position of a composer in the imperial court. On his way to Vienna, Vivaldi might have stopped in Graz to see Anna Girò.

==Death==

Vivaldi probably moved to Vienna to stage operas, especially as he took up residence near the Kärntnertortheater. Shortly after his arrival in Vienna, Charles VI died, which left the composer without any imperial patronage or a steady source of income. Soon afterwards, Vivaldi became impoverished and, during the night of 27/28 July 1741, aged 63, he died of &quot;internal infection&quot;, in a house owned by the widow of a Viennese saddlemaker.

On 28 July, Vivaldi&#x27;s funeral took place at St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral. Contrary to popular legend, the young Joseph Haydn who was in the cathedral choir at the time had nothing to do with his burial, since no music was performed on that occasion. The funeral was attended by six pall-bearers and six choir boys (&quot;Kuttenbuben&quot;), at a &quot;mean&quot; cost of 19 florins and 45 kreuzer. Only a &quot;Kleingeläut&quot; (small peal of bells), the lowest class, was provided, at a cost of 2 florins and 36 kreuzer.

Vivaldi was buried in a simple grave in a burial ground that was owned by the public hospital fund – the Bürgerspital-Gottesacker cemetery, next to St Charles Church, a baroque church in an area that is now part of the site of the TU Wien university. The cemetery existed until 1807. The house where he lived in Vienna has since been destroyed; the Hotel Sacher is built on part of the site. Memorial plaques have been placed at both locations, as well as a Vivaldi &quot;star&quot; in the Viennese Musikmeile and a monument at the Rooseveltplatz.

Only two, possibly three, original portraits of Vivaldi are known to survive: an engraving, an ink sketch and an oil painting. The engraving, which was the basis of several copies produced later by other artists, was made in 1725 by François Morellon de La Cave for the first edition of &quot;Il cimento dell&#x27;armonia e dell&#x27;inventione&quot;, and shows Vivaldi holding a sheet of music. The ink sketch, a caricature, was done by Ghezzi in 1723 and shows Vivaldi&#x27;s head and shoulders in profile. It exists in two versions: a first jotting kept at the Vatican Library, and a much lesser-known, slightly more detailed copy recently discovered in Moscow. The oil painting, which can be seen in the International Museum and Library of Music of Bologna, is by an anonymous artist and is thought to depict Vivaldi due to its strong resemblance to the La Cave engraving.

During his lifetime, Vivaldi was popular in many countries throughout Europe, including France, but after his death his popularity dwindled. After the end of the Baroque period, Vivaldi&#x27;s published concerti became relatively unknown, and were largely ignored. Even his most famous work, &quot;The Four Seasons&quot;, was unknown in its original edition during the Classical and Romantic periods. Vivaldi&#x27;s work was rediscovered in the 20th century.

==Works==
A composition by Vivaldi is identified by RV number, which refers to its place in the &quot;Ryom-Verzeichnis&quot; or &quot;Répertoire des oeuvres d&#x27;Antonio Vivaldi&quot;, a catalog created in the 20th century by the musicologist Peter Ryom.

&quot;Le quattro stagioni&quot; (The Four Seasons) of 1723 is his most famous work. The first four of the 12 concertos, titled &quot;Il cimento dell&#x27;armonia e dell&#x27;inventione&quot; (&quot;The Contest between Harmony and Invention&quot;), they depict moods and scenes from each of the four seasons. This work has been described as an outstanding example of pre-19th-century program music. Vivaldi&#x27;s other notable sets of 12 violin concertos include &quot;La stravaganza&quot; (The Eccentricity), &quot;L&#x27;estro armonico&quot; (The Harmonic Inspiration) and &quot;La cetra&quot; (The Lyre).

Vivaldi wrote more than 500 concertos. About 350 of these are for solo instrument and strings, of which 230 are for violin; the others are for bassoon, cello, oboe, flute, viola d&#x27;amore, recorder, lute, or mandolin. About forty concertos are for two instruments and strings, and about thirty are for three or more instruments and strings.

As well as about 46 operas, Vivaldi composed a large body of sacred choral music, such as the Gloria, RV 589; Nisi Dominus, RV 608; Magnificat, RV 610 and Stabat Mater, RV 621. Gloria, RV 589 remains one of Vivaldi&#x27;s more popular sacred works. Other works include sinfonias, about 90 sonatas and chamber music.

Some sonatas for flute, published as &quot;Il Pastor Fido&quot;, have been erroneously attributed to Vivaldi, but were composed by Nicolas Chédeville.

Vivaldi&#x27;s works attracted cataloging efforts befitting a major composer. Scholarly work intended to increase the accuracy and variety of Vivaldi performances also supported new discoveries that made old catalogs incomplete. Works still in circulation today might be numbered under several different systems (some earlier catalogs are mentioned here).

Because the simply consecutive Complete Edition (CE) numbers did not reflect the individual works (Opus numbers) into which compositions were grouped, numbers assigned by Antonio Fanna were often used in conjunction with CE numbers. Combined Complete Edition (CE)/Fanna numbering was especially common in the work of Italian groups driving the mid-20th-century revival of Vivaldi, such as Gli Accademici di Milano under Piero Santi. For example, the Bassoon Concerto in B major, &quot;La Notte&quot;, RV 501, became CE 12, F. VIII,1

Despite the awkwardness of having to overlay Fanna numbers onto the Complete Edition number for meaningful grouping of Vivaldi&#x27;s oeuvre, these numbers displaced the older Pincherle numbers as the (re-) discovery of more manuscripts had rendered older catalogs obsolete.

This cataloging work was led by the Istituto Italiano Antonio Vivaldi, where Gian Francesco Malipiero was both the director and the editor of the published scores (Edizioni G. Ricordi). His work built on that of Antonio Fanna, a Venetian businessman and the institute&#x27;s founder, and thus formed a bridge to the scholarly catalog dominant today.

Compositions by Vivaldi are identified today by RV number, the number assigned by Danish musicologist Peter Ryom in works published mostly in the 1970s, such as the &quot;Ryom-Verzeichnis&quot; or &quot;Répertoire des oeuvres d&#x27;Antonio Vivaldi&quot;. Like the Complete Edition before it, the RV does not typically assign its single, consecutive numbers to &quot;adjacent&quot; works that occupy one of the composer&#x27;s single opus numbers. Its goal as a modern catalog is to index the manuscripts and sources that establish the existence and nature of all known works.

===Style and influence===
The German scholar Walter Kolneder has discerned the influence of Legrenzi&#x27;s style in Vivaldi&#x27;s early liturgical work &quot;Laetatus sum&quot; (RV Anh 31), written in 1691 at the age of thirteen.

Vivaldi was also influenced by the Composer Arcangelo Corelli.

Johann Sebastian Bach was deeply influenced by Vivaldi&#x27;s concertos and arias (recalled in his &quot;St John Passion&quot;, &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot;, and cantatas). Bach transcribed six of Vivaldi&#x27;s concerti for solo keyboard, a further three for organ, and one for four harpsichords, strings, and basso continuo (BWV 1065) based upon the concerto for four violins, two violas, cello, and basso continuo (RV 580).

==Legacy==
In the early 20th century, Fritz Kreisler&#x27;s Concerto in C, in the Style of Vivaldi (which he passed off as an original Vivaldi work) helped revive Vivaldi&#x27;s reputation. Kreisler&#x27;s concerto in C spurred the French scholar Marc Pincherle to begin an academic study of Vivaldi&#x27;s oeuvre. Many Vivaldi manuscripts were rediscovered, and were acquired by the Turin National University Library as a result of the generous sponsorship of Turinese businessmen Roberto Foa and Filippo Giordano, in memory of their sons. This led to a renewed interest in Vivaldi by, among others, Mario Rinaldi, Alfredo Casella, Ezra Pound, Olga Rudge, Desmond Chute, Arturo Toscanini, Arnold Schering and Louis Kaufman, all of whom were instrumental in the revival of Vivaldi throughout the 20th century.

In 1926, in a monastery in Piedmont, researchers discovered fourteen bound volumes of Vivaldi&#x27;s work (later discovered to be fifteen) that were previously thought to have been lost during the Napoleonic Wars. Some missing tomes in the numbered set were discovered in the collections of the descendants of the Grand Duke Durazzo, who had acquired the monastery complex in the 18th century. The volumes contained 300 concertos, 19 operas and over 100 vocal-instrumental works.

The resurrection of Vivaldi&#x27;s unpublished works in the 20th century greatly benefited from the noted efforts of Alfredo Casella, who in 1939 organized the historic Vivaldi Week, in which the rediscovered Gloria (RV 589) and l&#x27;Olimpiade were revived. Since World War II, Vivaldi&#x27;s compositions have enjoyed wide success. Historically informed performances, often on &quot;original instruments&quot;, have increased Vivaldi&#x27;s fame still further.

Recent rediscoveries of works by Vivaldi include two psalm settings: Psalm 127, &quot;Nisi Dominus&quot; RV 803 (in eight movements); and Psalm 110, &quot;Dixit Dominus&quot; RV 807 (in eleven movements). These were identified in 2003 and 2005, respectively, by the Australian scholar Janice Stockigt. The Vivaldi scholar Michael Talbot described RV 807 as &quot;arguably the best nonoperatic work from Vivaldi&#x27;s pen to come to light since ... the 1920s&quot;.

In February 2002, musicologist discovered 70% of the music for the opera Motezuma (RV 723) in the Sing-Akademie zu Berlin archives. Long thought lost, it was described by Dutch musicologist as &quot;the most important Vivaldi discovery in 75 years.&quot; One of the earliest operas to have been set in the Americas, versions of it were staged in Düsseldorf in 2005 and Long Beach in 2009.

Vivaldi&#x27;s 1730 opera, &quot;Argippo&quot; (RV 697), which had also been considered lost, was rediscovered in 2006 by the harpsichordist and conductor Ondřej Macek, whose Hofmusici orchestra performed the work at Prague Castle on 3 May 2008—its first performance since 1730.

Modern depictions of Vivaldi&#x27;s life include a 2005 radio play, commissioned by ABC Radio National and written by Sean Riley. Entitled &quot;The Angel and the Red Priest&quot;, the play was later adapted for the stage and performed at the Adelaide Festival of the Arts. Films about Vivaldi include: &#x27; (1989), an Italian-French co-production under the direction of Étienne Périer; &#x27; (2006), an Italian-French co-production under the direction of ; and &quot;Vivaldi, the Red Priest&quot; (2009), an Italian film created and directed by Liana Marabini, and loosely based on Vivaldi&#x27;s life as both priest and composer.

<text>Adrian is a form of the Latin given name Adrianus or Hadrianus. Its ultimate origin is most likely via the former river Adria from the Venetic and Illyrian word &quot;adur&quot;, meaning &quot;sea&quot; or &quot;water&quot;.

The Adria was until the 8th century BC the main channel of the Po River into the Adriatic Sea but ceased to exist before the 1st century BC. Hecataeus of Miletus (c.550 – c.476 BC) asserted that both the Etruscan harbor city of Adria and the Adriatic Sea had been named after it. Emperor Hadrian&#x27;s family was named after the city or region of Adria/Hadria, now Atri, in Picenum, which most likely started as an Etruscan or Greek colony of the older harbor city of the same name. 

Several saints and six popes have borne this name, including the only English pope, Adrian IV, and the only Dutch pope, Adrian VI. As an English name, it has been in use since the Middle Ages.

<text>The Aare () or Aar () is the main tributary of the High Rhine (its discharge even exceeds that of the latter at their confluence) and the longest river that both rises and ends entirely within Switzerland.

Its total length from its source to its junction with the Rhine comprises about , during which distance it descends , draining an area of , almost entirely within Switzerland, and accounting for close to half the area of the country, including all of Central Switzerland.

There are more than 40 hydroelectric plants along the course of the Aare.

The river&#x27;s name dates to at least the La Tène period, and it is attested as &quot;Nantaror&quot; &quot;Aare valley&quot; in the Berne zinc tablet.

The name was Latinized as &quot;Arula&quot;/&quot;Arola&quot;/&quot;Araris&quot;.

==Course==


The Aare rises in the great Aargletschers (Aare Glaciers) of the Bernese Alps, in the canton of Bern and west of the Grimsel Pass. The Finsteraargletscher and Lauteraargletscher come together to form the Unteraargletscher (Lower Aar Glacier), which is the main source of water for the Grimselsee (Lake of Grimsel). The Oberaargletscher (Upper Aar Glacier) feeds the Oberaarsee, which also flows into the Grimselsee. The Aare leaves the Grimselsee just to the east to the Grimsel Hospiz, below the Grimsel Pass, and then flows northwest through the Haslital, forming on the way the magnificent Handegg Waterfall, , past Guttannen.

Right after Innertkirchen it is joined by its first major tributary, the Gamderwasser. Less than later the river carves through a limestone ridge in the Aare Gorge (). It is here that the Aare proves itself to be more than just a river, as it attracts thousands of tourists annually to the causeways through the gorge. A little past Meiringen, near Brienz, the river expands into Lake Brienz. Near the west end of the lake it indirectly receives its first important tributary, the Lütschine, by the Lake of Brienz. It then runs across the swampy plain of the Bödeli (Swiss German diminutive for ground) between Interlaken and Unterseen before flowing into Lake Thun.

Near the west end of Lake Thun, the river indirectly receives the waters of the Kander, which has just been joined by the Simme, by the Lake of Thun. Lake Thun marks the head of navigation. On flowing out of the lake it passes through Thun, and then flows through the city of Bern, passing beneath eighteen bridges and around the steeply-flanked peninsula on which the Old City is located. To the south of the Old City peninsula is the , a weir which provides water for the small Matte hydroelectric power plant. River swimming in the Aare is popular in Bern, and the river is sometimes full of bathers on summer days. The river soon changes its northwesterly flow for a due westerly direction, but after receiving the Saane or La Sarine it turns north until it nears Aarberg. There, in one of the major Swiss engineering feats of the 19th century, the Jura water correction, the river, which had previously rendered the countryside north of Bern a swampland through frequent flooding, was diverted by the Aare-Hagneck Canal into the Lac de Bienne. From the upper end of the lake, at Nidau, the river issues through the Nidau-Büren Canal, also called the Aare Canal, and then runs east to Büren. The lake absorbs huge amounts of eroded gravel and snowmelt that the river brings from the Alps, and the former swamps have become fruitful plains: they are known as the &quot;vegetable garden of Switzerland&quot;.

From here the Aare flows northeast for a long distance, past the ambassador town Solothurn (below which the Grosse Emme flows in on the right), Aarburg (where it is joined by the Wigger), Olten, Aarau, near which is the junction with the Suhre, and Wildegg, where the Seetal Aabach falls in on the right. A short distance further, below Brugg, it receives first the Reuss, its major tributary, and shortly afterwards the Limmat, its second strongest tributary. It now turns due north, and soon becomes itself a tributary of the Rhine, which it even surpasses in volume when the two rivers unite downstream from Koblenz (Switzerland), opposite Waldshut in Germany. The Rhine, in turn, empties into the North Sea after crossing into the Netherlands.

== Incidents ==
On May 26, 2022, Indonesia West Java Governor Ridwan Kamil&#x27;s eldest child, Emmeril Kahn Mumtadz, was declared missing after being swept away by the river current. Chronologically, Eril was swimming in the river with his sister and friends. When he wanted to rise to the surface, Eril was dragged by a fairly swift current of the river which had previously received help from his friend. The search efforts involving the police search and rescue team, maritime police, fire department, and authority of the city of Bern. One week after declared missing, Emmeril Kahn Mumtadz was declared dead &quot;in absentia&quot; at the age of 22. Although on June 9, 2022, Eril&#x27;s body was located. The funeral procession of Emmeril “Eril” Kahn Mumtadz took place in the family&#x27;s burial ground located in Cimaung, Bandung regency, West Java. Soon after news about Eril&#x27;s body brought back to his home, Indonesian netizens review bombed Aare River&#x27;s Google listing, leaving negative comments and one-star ratings as if the waterway was fully to blame for the tragedy.

<text>Abbotsford is a historic country house in the Scottish Borders, near Galashiels, on the south bank of the River Tweed. Now open to the public, it was built as the residence of historical novelist and poet Sir Walter Scott between 1817 and 1825. It is a Category A Listed Building and the estate is listed in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland.

==Description==
The nucleus of the estate was a farm of , called Cartleyhole, nicknamed Clarty (i.e., muddy) Hole, and was bought by Scott on the lapse of his lease (1811) of the neighbouring house of Ashestiel. Scott renamed it &quot;Abbotsford&quot; after a neighbouring ford used by the monks of Melrose Abbey. 

Following a modest enlargement of the original farmhouse in 1811–1812, massive expansions took place in 1816–1819 and 1822–1824. In this mansion Scott gathered a large library, a collection of ancient furniture, arms and armour, and other relics and curiosities especially connected with Scottish history, notably the Celtic Torrs Pony-cap and Horns and the Woodwrae Stone, all now in the Museum of Scotland. Scott described the resulting building as &quot;a sort of romance in Architecture&quot; and &quot;a kind of Conundrum Castle to be sure&quot;.

The last and principal acquisition was that of Toftfield (afterwards named Huntlyburn), purchased in 1817. The new house was then begun and completed in 1824.

The general ground-plan is a parallelogram, with irregular outlines, one side overlooking the Tweed; and the style is mainly the Scottish Baronial. With his architects William Atkinson and Edward Blore Scott was a pioneer of the Scottish Baronial style of architecture: the house is recognized as a highly influential creation with themes from Abbotsford being reflected across many buildings in the Scottish Borders and beyond. 

The manor as a whole appears as a &quot;castle-in-miniature&quot;, with small towers and imitation battlements decorating the house and garden walls. Into various parts of the fabric were built relics and curiosities from historical structures, such as the doorway of the old Tolbooth in Edinburgh. 

Scott collected many of these curiosities to be built into the walls of the South Garden, which previously hosted a colonnade of gothic arches along the garden walls. Along the path of the former colonnade sits the remains of Edinburgh&#x27;s 15th century Mercat Cross and several examples of classical sculpture.

The estate and its neo-Medieval features nod towards Scott&#x27;s desire for a historical feel, but the writer ensured that the house would provide all the comforts of modern living. As a result, Scott used the space as a proving-ground for new technologies. The house was outfitted with early gas lighting and pneumatic bells connecting residents with servants elsewhere in the house.

Scott had only enjoyed his residence one year when (1825) he met with that reverse of fortune which involved the estate in debt. In 1830, the library and museum were presented to him as a free gift by the creditors. The property was wholly disencumbered in 1847 by Robert Cadell, the publisher, who cancelled the bond upon it in exchange for the family&#x27;s share in the copyright of Sir Walter&#x27;s works.

Scott&#x27;s only son Walter did not live to enjoy the property, having died on his way from India in 1847. Among subsequent possessors were Scott&#x27;s grandson Walter Scott Lockhart (later Walter Lockhart Scott, 1826–1853), his younger sister Charlotte Harriet Jane Hope-Scott (née Lockhart) 1828–1858, J. R. Hope Scott, QC, and his daughter (Scott&#x27;s great-granddaughter), the Hon. Mrs Maxwell Scott.

The house was opened to the public in 1833, but continued to be occupied by Scott&#x27;s descendants until 2004. The last of his direct descendants to hold the Lairdship of Abbotsford was his great-great-great-granddaughter Dame Jean Maxwell-Scott (8 June 1923 – 5 May 2004). She inherited it from her elder sister Patricia Maxwell-Scott in 1998. The sisters turned the house into one of Scotland&#x27;s premier tourist attractions, after they had to rely on paying visitors to afford the upkeep of the house. It had electricity installed only in 1962.

Dame Jean was at one time a lady-in-waiting to Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester, patron of the Dandie Dinmont Club, a breed of dog named after one of Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s characters; and a horse trainer, one of whose horses, Sir Wattie, ridden by Ian Stark, won two silver medals at the 1988 Summer Olympics.

On Dame Jean&#x27;s death the Abbotsford Trust was established to safeguard the estate.

In 2005, Scottish Borders Council considered an application by a property developer to build a housing estate on the opposite bank of the River Tweed from Abbotsford, to which Historic Scotland and the National Trust for Scotland objected. There have been modifications to the proposed development, but it is still being opposed in 2020.

Sir Walter Scott rescued the &quot;jougs&quot; from Threave Castle in Dumfries and Galloway and attached them to the castellated gateway he built at Abbotsford.

Tweedbank railway station is located near to Abbotsford.

==Miscellaneous==
Abbotsford gave its name to the Abbotsford Club, founded by William Barclay Turnbull in 1833 or 1834 in Scott&#x27;s honour, and a successor to the Bannatyne and Maitland Clubs. It was a text publication society, which existed to print and publish historical works connected with Scott&#x27;s writings. Its publications extended from 1835 to 1864.

In August 2012, a new Visitor Centre opened at Abbotsford which houses a small exhibition, gift shop and Ochiltree&#x27;s café with views over the house and grounds. The house re-opened to the public after extensive renovations in July 2013.

In 2014 it won the European Union Prize for Cultural Heritage / Europa Nostra Award for its then recent conservation project.

<doc id="1436" wikidata="Q9181" url="?curid=1436" title="Abraham">
<text>Abraham (originally Abram) is the common Hebrew patriarch of the Abrahamic religions, including Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. In Judaism, he is the founding father of the special relationship between the Jews and God; in Christianity, he is the spiritual progenitor of all believers, whether Jewish or non-Jewish; and in Islam, he is a link in the chain of Islamic prophets that begins with Adam and culminates in Muhammad. As the namesake of the Abrahamic religions, Abraham is also revered in other Abrahamic religions, such as the Druze faith and the Baháʼí Faith.

The story of the life of Abraham, as told in the narrative of the Book of Genesis in the Hebrew Bible, revolves around the themes of posterity and land. He is said to have been called by God to leave the house of his father Terah and settle in the land of Canaan, which God now promises to Abraham and his progeny. This promise is subsequently inherited by Isaac, Abraham&#x27;s son by his wife Sarah, while Isaac&#x27;s half-brother Ishmael is also promised that he will be the founder of a great nation. Abraham purchases a tomb (the Cave of the Patriarchs) at Hebron to be Sarah&#x27;s grave, thus establishing his right to the land; and, in the second generation, his heir Isaac is married to a woman from his own kin to earn his parents&#x27; approval. Abraham later marries Keturah and has six more sons; but, on his death, when he is buried beside Sarah, it is Isaac who receives &quot;all Abraham&#x27;s goods&quot; while the other sons receive only &quot;gifts&quot;.

Most scholars view the patriarchal age, along with the Exodus and the period of the biblical judges, as a late literary construct that does not relate to any particular historical era, and after a century of exhaustive archaeological investigation, no evidence has been found for a historical Abraham. It is largely concluded that the Torah, the series of books that includes Genesis, was composed during the early Persian period, , as a result of tensions between Jewish landowners who had stayed in Judah during the Babylonian captivity and traced their right to the land through their &quot;father Abraham&quot;, and the returning exiles who based their counterclaim on Moses and the Exodus tradition of the Israelites.

==The Abraham cycle in the Bible==

===Structure and narrative programs===
The Abraham cycle is not structured by a unified plot centered on a conflict and its resolution or a problem and its solution. The episodes are often only loosely linked, and the sequence is not always logical, but it is unified by the presence of Abraham himself, as either actor or witness, and by the themes of posterity and land. These themes form &quot;narrative programs&quot; set out in Genesis 11:27–31 concerning the sterility of Sarah and 12:1–3 in which Abraham is ordered to leave the land of his birth for the land God will show him.

===Origins and calling===

Terah, the ninth in descent from Noah, was the father of Abram, Nahor, Haran ( &quot;Hārān&quot;) and Sarah. Haran was the father of Lot, who was Abram&#x27;s nephew; the family lived in Ur of the Chaldees. Haran died there. Abram married Sarah (Sarai). Terah, Abram, Sarai, and Lot departed for Canaan, but settled in a place named Haran ( &quot;Ḥārān&quot;), where Terah died at the age of 205. According to some exegetes (like Nahmanides), Abram was actually born in Haran and he later relocated to Ur, while some of his family remained in Haran.

God had told Abram to leave his country and kindred and go to a land that he would show him, and promised to make of him a great nation, bless him, make his name great, bless them that bless him, and curse them who may curse him. Abram was 75 years old when he left Haran with his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, and their possessions and people that they had acquired, and traveled to Shechem in Canaan. Then he pitched his tent in the east of Bethel, and built an altar which was between Bethel and Ai.

===Sarai===

There was a severe famine in the land of Canaan, so that Abram, Lot, and their households traveled to Egypt. On the way Abram told Sarai to say that she was his sister, so that the Egyptians would not kill him. When they entered Egypt, the Pharaoh&#x27;s officials praised Sarai&#x27;s beauty to Pharaoh, and they took her into the palace and gave Abram goods in exchange. God afflicted Pharaoh and his household with plagues, which led Pharaoh to try to find out what was wrong. Upon discovering that Sarai was a married woman, Pharaoh demanded that Abram and Sarai leave.

===Abram and Lot separate===

When they lived for a while in the Negev after being banished from Egypt and came back to the Bethel and Ai area, Abram&#x27;s and Lot&#x27;s sizable herds occupied the same pastures. This became a problem for the herdsmen, who were assigned to each family&#x27;s cattle. The conflicts between herdsmen had become so troublesome that Abram suggested that Lot choose a separate area, either on the left hand or on the right hand, that there be no conflict between them. Lot decided to go eastward to the plain of Jordan, where the land was well watered everywhere as far as Zoara, and he dwelled in the cities of the plain toward Sodom. Abram went south to Hebron and settled in the plain of Mamre, where he built another altar to worship God.

===Chedorlaomer===

During the rebellion of the Jordan River cities, Sodom and Gomorrah, against Elam, Abram&#x27;s nephew, Lot, was taken prisoner along with his entire household by the invading Elamite forces. The Elamite army came to collect the spoils of war, after having just defeated the king of Sodom&#x27;s armies. Lot and his family, at the time, were settled on the outskirts of the Kingdom of Sodom which made them a visible target.

One person who escaped capture came and told Abram what happened. Once Abram received this news, he immediately assembled 318 trained servants. Abram&#x27;s force headed north in pursuit of the Elamite army, who were already worn down from the Battle of Siddim. When they caught up with them at Dan, Abram devised a battle plan by splitting his group into more than one unit, and launched a night raid. Not only were they able to free the captives, Abram&#x27;s unit chased and slaughtered the Elamite King Chedorlaomer at Hobah, just north of Damascus. They freed Lot, as well as his household and possessions, and recovered all of the goods from Sodom that had been taken.

Upon Abram&#x27;s return, Sodom&#x27;s king came out to meet with him in the Valley of Shaveh, the &quot;king&#x27;s dale&quot;. Also, Melchizedek king of Salem (Jerusalem), a priest of El Elyon, brought out bread and wine and blessed Abram and God. Abram then gave Melchizedek a tenth of everything. The king of Sodom then offered to let Abram keep all the possessions if he would merely return his people. Abram declined to accept anything other than the share to which his allies were entitled.

===Covenant of the pieces===
The voice of the Lord came to Abram in a vision and repeated the promise of the land and descendants as numerous as the stars. Abram and God made a covenant ceremony, and God told of the future bondage of Israel in Egypt. God described to Abram the land that his offspring would claim: the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites, Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaims, Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites, and Jebusites.

===Hagar===

Abram and Sarai tried to make sense of how he would become a progenitor of nations, because after 10 years of living in Canaan, no child had been born. Sarai then offered her Egyptian slave, Hagar, to Abram with the intention that she would bear him a son.

After Hagar found she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress, Sarai. Sarai responded by mistreating Hagar, and Hagar fled into the wilderness. An angel spoke with Hagar at the fountain on the way to Shur. He instructed her to return to Abram&#x27;s camp and that her son would be &quot;a wild ass of a man; his hand shall be against every man, and every man&#x27;s hand against him; and he shall dwell in the face of all his brethren.&quot; She was told to call her son Ishmael. Hagar then called God who spoke to her &quot;El-roi&quot;, (&quot;Thou God seest me:&quot; KJV). From that day onward, the well was called Beer-lahai-roi, (&quot;The well of him that liveth and seeth me.&quot; KJV margin), located between Kadesh and Bered. She then did as she was instructed by returning to her mistress in order to have her child. Abram was 86 years of age when Ishmael was born.

===Sarah===
Thirteen years later, when Abram was 99 years of age, God declared Abram&#x27;s new name: &quot;Abraham&quot; – &quot;a father of many nations&quot;. Abraham then received the instructions for the covenant of the pieces, of which circumcision was to be the sign.

God declared Sarai&#x27;s new name: &quot;Sarah&quot;, blessed her, and told Abraham, &quot;I will give thee a son also of her&quot;. Abraham laughed, and &quot;said in his heart, &#x27;Shall a &quot;child&quot; be born unto him that is a hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear [a child]?&#x27;&quot; Immediately after Abraham&#x27;s encounter with God, he had his entire household of men, including himself (age 99) and Ishmael (age 13), circumcised.

===Three visitors===
Not long afterward, during the heat of the day, Abraham had been sitting at the entrance of his tent by the terebinths of Mamre. He looked up and saw three men in the presence of God. Then he ran and bowed to the ground to welcome them. Abraham then offered to wash their feet and fetch them a morsel of bread, to which they assented. Abraham rushed to Sarah&#x27;s tent to order ash cakes made from choice flour, then he ordered a servant-boy to prepare a choice calf. When all was prepared, he set curds, milk and the calf before them, waiting on them, under a tree, as they ate.

One of the visitors told Abraham that upon his return next year, Sarah would have a son. While at the tent entrance, Sarah overheard what was said and she laughed to herself about the prospect of having a child at their ages. The visitor inquired of Abraham why Sarah laughed at bearing a child at her age, as nothing is too hard for God. Frightened, Sarah denied laughing.

===Abraham&#x27;s plea===

After eating, Abraham and the three visitors got up. They walked over to the peak that overlooked the &#x27;cities of the plain&#x27; to discuss the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah for their detestable sins that were so great, it moved God to action. Because Abraham&#x27;s nephew was living in Sodom, God revealed plans to confirm and judge these cities. At this point, the two other visitors left for Sodom. Then Abraham turned to God and pleaded decrementally with Him (from fifty persons to less) that &quot;if there were at least ten righteous men found in the city, would not God spare the city?&quot; For the sake of ten righteous people, God declared that he would not destroy the city.

When the two visitors arrived in Sodom to conduct their report, they planned on staying in the city square. However, Abraham&#x27;s nephew, Lot, met with them and strongly insisted that these two &quot;men&quot; stay at his house for the night. A rally of men stood outside of Lot&#x27;s home and demanded that Lot bring out his guests so that they may &quot;know&quot; ( 5) them. However, Lot objected and offered his virgin daughters who had not &quot;known&quot; (v. 8) man to the rally of men instead. They rejected that notion and sought to break down Lot&#x27;s door to get to his male guests, thus confirming the wickedness of the city and portending their imminent destruction.

Early the next morning, Abraham went to the place where he stood before God. He &quot;looked out toward Sodom and Gomorrah&quot; and saw what became of the cities of the plain, where not even &quot;ten righteous&quot; (v. 18:32) had been found, as &quot;the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace.&quot;

===Abimelech===

Abraham settled between Kadesh and Shur in what the Bible anachronistically calls &quot;the land of the Philistines&quot;. While he was living in Gerar, Abraham openly claimed that Sarah was his sister. Upon discovering this news, King Abimelech had her brought to him. God then came to Abimelech in a dream and declared that taking her would result in death because she was a man&#x27;s wife. Abimelech had not laid hands on her, so he inquired if he would also slay a righteous nation, especially since Abraham had claimed that he and Sarah were siblings. In response, God told Abimelech that he did indeed have a blameless heart and that is why he continued to exist. However, should he not return the wife of Abraham back to him, God would surely destroy Abimelech and his entire household. Abimelech was informed that Abraham was a prophet who would pray for him.

Early next morning, Abimelech informed his servants of his dream and approached Abraham inquiring as to why he had brought such great guilt upon his kingdom. Abraham stated that he thought there was no fear of God in that place, and that they might kill him for his wife. Then Abraham defended what he had said as not being a lie at all: &quot;And yet indeed &quot;she is&quot; my sister; she &quot;is&quot; the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.&quot; Abimelech returned Sarah to Abraham, and gave him gifts of sheep, oxen, and servants; and invited him to settle wherever he pleased in Abimelech&#x27;s lands. Further, Abimelech gave Abraham a thousand pieces of silver to serve as Sarah&#x27;s vindication before all. Abraham then prayed for Abimelech and his household, since God had stricken the women with infertility because of the taking of Sarah.

After living for some time in the land of the Philistines, Abimelech and Phicol, the chief of his troops, approached Abraham because of a dispute that resulted in a violent confrontation at a well. Abraham then reproached Abimelech due to his Philistine servant&#x27;s aggressive attacks and the seizing of Abraham&#x27;s Well. Abimelech claimed ignorance of the incident. Then Abraham offered a pact by providing sheep and oxen to Abimelech. Further, to attest that Abraham was the one who dug the well, he also gave Abimelech seven ewes for proof. Because of this sworn oath, they called the place of this well: Beersheba. After Abimelech and Phicol headed back to Philistia, Abraham planted a tamarisk grove in Beersheba and called upon &quot;the name of the , the everlasting God.&quot;

===Isaac===
As had been prophesied in Mamre the previous year, Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham, on the first anniversary of the covenant of circumcision. Abraham was &quot;an hundred years old&quot;, when his son whom he named Isaac was born; and he circumcised him when he was eight days old. For Sarah, the thought of giving birth and nursing a child, at such an old age, also brought her much laughter, as she declared, &quot;God hath made me to laugh, so that all who hear will laugh with me.&quot; Isaac continued to grow and on the day he was weaned, Abraham held a great feast to honor the occasion. During the celebration, however, Sarah found Ishmael mocking; an observation that would begin to clarify the birthright of Isaac.

===Ishmael===

Ishmael was fourteen years old when Abraham&#x27;s son Isaac was born to Sarah. When she found Ishmael teasing Isaac, Sarah told Abraham to send both Ishmael and Hagar away. She declared that Ishmael would not share in Isaac&#x27;s inheritance. Abraham was greatly distressed by his wife&#x27;s words and sought the advice of his God. God told Abraham not to be distressed but to do as his wife commanded. God reassured Abraham that &quot;in Isaac shall seed be called to thee.&quot; He also said Ishmael would make a nation, &quot;because he is thy seed&quot;.

Early the next morning, Abraham brought Hagar and Ishmael out together. He gave her bread and water and sent them away. The two wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba until her bottle of water was completely consumed. In a moment of despair, she burst into tears. After God heard the boy&#x27;s voice, an angel of the Lord confirmed to Hagar that he would become a great nation, and will be &quot;living on his sword&quot;. A well of water then appeared so that it saved their lives. As the boy grew, he became a skilled archer living in the wilderness of Paran. Eventually his mother found a wife for Ishmael from her home country, the land of Egypt.

===Binding of Isaac===

At some point in Isaac&#x27;s youth, Abraham was commanded by God to offer his son up as a sacrifice in the land of Moriah. The patriarch traveled three days until he came to the mount that God told him of. He then commanded the servants to remain while he and Isaac proceeded alone into the mount. Isaac carried the wood upon which he would be sacrificed. Along the way, Isaac asked his father where the animal for the burnt offering was, to which Abraham replied &quot;God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering&quot;. Just as Abraham was about to sacrifice his son, he was interrupted by the angel of the Lord, and he saw behind him a &quot;ram caught in a thicket by his horns&quot;, which he sacrificed instead of his son. The place was later named as Jehovah-jireh. For his obedience he received another promise of numerous descendants and abundant prosperity. After this event, Abraham went to Beersheba.

===Later years===

Sarah died, and Abraham buried her in the Cave of the Patriarchs (the &quot;cave of Machpelah&quot;), near Hebron which he had purchased along with the adjoining field from Ephron the Hittite. After the death of Sarah, Abraham took another wife, a concubine named Keturah, by whom he had six sons: Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. According to the Bible, reflecting the change of his name to &quot;Abraham&quot; meaning &quot;a father of many nations&quot;, Abraham is considered to be the progenitor of many nations mentioned in the Bible, among others the Israelites, Ishmaelites, Edomites, Amalekites, Kenizzites, Midianites and Assyrians, and through his nephew Lot he was also related to the Moabites and Ammonites. Abraham lived to see Isaac marry Rebekah, and to see the birth of his twin grandsons Jacob and Esau. He died at age 175, and was buried in the cave of Machpelah by his sons Isaac and Ishmael.

==Historicity and origins of the narrative==
===Historicity===
In the early and middle 20th century, leading archaeologists such as William F. Albright and G. Ernest Wright and biblical scholars such as Albrecht Alt and John Bright believed that the patriarchs and matriarchs were either real individuals or believable composites of people who lived in the &quot;patriarchal age&quot;, the 2nd millennium BCE. But, in the 1970s, new arguments concerning Israel&#x27;s past and the biblical texts challenged these views; these arguments can be found in Thomas L. Thompson&#x27;s &quot;The Historicity of the Patriarchal Narratives&quot; (1974), and John Van Seters&#x27; &quot;Abraham in History and Tradition&quot; (1975). Thompson, a literary scholar, based his argument on archaeology and ancient texts. His thesis centered on the lack of compelling evidence that the patriarchs lived in the 2nd millennium BCE, and noted how certain biblical texts reflected first millennium conditions and concerns. Van Seters examined the patriarchal stories and argued that their names, social milieu, and messages strongly suggested that they were Iron Age creations. Van Seters&#x27; and Thompson&#x27;s works were a paradigm shift in biblical scholarship and archaeology, which gradually led scholars to no longer consider the patriarchal narratives as historical. Some conservative scholars attempted to defend the Patriarchal narratives in the following years, but this has not found acceptance among scholars. By the beginning of the 21st century, archaeologists had stopped trying to recover any context that would make Abraham, Isaac or Jacob credible historical figures.

=== Origins of the narrative===

Abraham&#x27;s story, like those of the other patriarchs, most likely had a substantial oral prehistory (he is mentioned in the Book of Ezekiel and the Book of Isaiah). As with Moses, Abraham&#x27;s name is apparently very ancient, as the tradition found in the Book of Genesis no longer understands its original meaning (probably &quot;Father is exalted&quot; – the meaning offered in Genesis 17:5, &quot;Father of a multitude&quot;, is a folk etymology). At some stage the oral traditions became part of the written tradition of the Pentateuch; a majority of scholars believe this stage belongs to the Persian period, roughly 520–320 BCE. The mechanisms by which this came about remain unknown, but there are currently at least two hypotheses. The first, called Persian Imperial authorisation, is that the post-Exilic community devised the Torah as a legal basis on which to function within the Persian Imperial system; the second is that the Pentateuch was written to provide the criteria for determining who would belong to the post-Exilic Jewish community and to establish the power structures and relative positions of its various groups, notably the priesthood and the lay &quot;elders&quot;.

The completion of the Torah and its elevation to the centre of post-Exilic Judaism was as much or more about combining older texts as writing new ones – the final Pentateuch was based on existing traditions. In the Book of Ezekiel, written during the Exile (i.e., in the first half of the 6th century BCE), Ezekiel, an exile in Babylon, tells how those who remained in Judah are claiming ownership of the land based on inheritance from Abraham; but the prophet tells them they have no claim because they do not observe Torah. The Book of Isaiah similarly testifies of tension between the people of Judah and the returning post-Exilic Jews (the &quot;gôlâ&quot;), stating that God is the father of Israel and that Israel&#x27;s history begins with the Exodus and not with Abraham. The conclusion to be inferred from this and similar evidence (e.g., Ezra–Nehemiah), is that the figure of Abraham must have been preeminent among the great landowners of Judah at the time of the Exile and after, serving to support their claims to the land in opposition to those of the returning exiles.

=== Amorite origin hypothesis ===
According to Nissim Amzallag, the Book of Genesis portrays Abraham as having an Amorite origin, arguing that the patriarch&#x27;s provenance from the region of Harran as described in associates him with the territory of the Amorite homeland. He also notes parallels between the biblical narrative and the Amorite migration into the Southern Levant in the 2nd millennium BCE. Likewise, some scholars like Daniel E. Fleming and Alice Mandell have argued that the biblical portrayal of the Patriarchs&#x27; lifestyle appears to reflect the Amorite culture of the 2nd millennium BCE as attested in texts from the ancient city-state of Mari, suggesting that the Genesis stories retain historical memories of the ancestral origins of some of the Israelites. Alan Millard argues that the name Abram is of Amorite origin and that it is attested in Mari as &quot;ʾabī-rām&quot;. He also suggests that the Patriarch&#x27;s name corresponds to a form typical of the Middle Bronze Age and not of later periods.

===Palestine origin hypothesis===
The earliest possible reference to Abraham may be the name of a town in the Negev listed in a victory inscription of Pharaoh Sheshonq I (biblical Shishak), which is referred as &quot;the Fortress of Abraham&quot;, suggesting the possible existence of an Abraham tradition in the 10th century BCE. The orientalist Mario Liverani proposed to see in the name Abraham the mythical eponym of a Palestinian tribe from the 13th century BCE, that of the Raham, of which mention was found in the stele of Seti I found in Beth-She&#x27;an and dating back to &#x27;around 1289 BCE. The tribe probably lived in the area surrounding or close to Beth-She&#x27;an, in Galilee (the stele in fact refers to fights that took place in the area). The semi-nomadic and pastoral Semitic tribes of the time used to prefix their names with the term banū (&quot;sons of&quot;), so it is hypothesized that the Raham called themselves Banu Raham. Furthermore, many interpreted blood ties between tribe members as common descent from an eponymous ancestor (i.e., one who gave the tribe its name), rather than as the result of intra-tribal ties. The name of this eponymous mythical ancestor was constructed with the patronymic (prefix) Abū (&quot;father&quot;), followed by the name of the tribe; in the case of the Raham, it would have been Abu Raham, later to become Ab-raham, Abraham. Abraham&#x27;s Journey from Ur to Harran could be explained as a retrospective reflection of the story of the return of the Jews from the Babylonian exile. Indeed, Israel Finkelstein suggested that the oldest Abraham traditions originated in the Iron Age (monarchic period) and that they contained an hero story, as the oldest mentions of Abraham outside the book of Genesis (Ezekiel 33 and Isaiah 51): do not depend on Genesis 12–26; do not have an indication of a Mesopotamian origin of Abraham; and present only two main themes of the Abraham narrative in Genesis—land and offspring. Yet, unlike Liverani, Finkelstein considered Abraham as ancestor who was worshiped in Hebron, which is too far from Beit She&#x27;an, and the oldest tradition of him might be about the altar he built in Hebron.

== Religious traditions ==

Abraham is given a high position of respect in three major world faiths, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. In Judaism, he is the founding father of the covenant, the special relationship between the Jewish people and God—leading to the belief that the Jews are the chosen people of God. In Christianity, Paul the Apostle taught that Abraham&#x27;s faith in God—preceding the Mosaic law—made him the prototype of all believers, Jewish or gentile; and in Islam, he is seen as a link in the chain of prophets that begins with Adam and culminates in Muhammad.

===Judaism===
In Jewish tradition, Abraham is called &quot;Avraham Avinu&quot; (אברהם אבינו), &quot;our father Abraham,&quot; signifying that he is both the biological progenitor of the Jews and the father of Judaism, the first Jew. His story is read in the weekly Torah reading portions, predominantly in the parashot: Lech-Lecha (לֶךְ-לְךָ), Vayeira (וַיֵּרָא), Chayei Sarah (חַיֵּי שָׂרָה), and Toledot (תּוֹלְדֹת).

Hanan bar Rava taught in Abba Arikha&#x27;s name that Abraham&#x27;s mother was named ʾĂmatlaʾy bat Karnebo. Hiyya bar Abba taught that Abraham worked in Teraḥ&#x27;s idol shop in his youth.

In &quot;Legends of the Jews&quot;, God created heaven and earth for the sake of the merits of Abraham. After the biblical flood, Abraham was the only one among the pious who solemnly swore never to forsake God, studied in the house of Noah and Shem to learn about the &quot;Ways of God,&quot; continued the line of High Priest from Noah and Shem, and assigning the office to Levi and his seed forever. Before leaving his father&#x27;s land, Abraham was miraculously saved from the fiery furnace of Nimrod following his brave action of breaking the idols of the Chaldeans into pieces. During his sojourning in Canaan, Abraham was accustomed to extend hospitality to travelers and strangers and taught how to praise God also knowledge of God to those who had received his kindness.

Along with Isaac and Jacob, he is the one whose name would appear united with God, as God in Judaism was called &quot;Elohei Abraham, Elohei Yitzchaq ve Elohei Ya&#x27;aqob&quot; (&quot;God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob&quot;) and never the God of anyone else. He was also mentioned as the father of thirty nations.

Abraham is generally credited as the author of the &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot;, one of the earliest extant books on Jewish mysticism.

According to Pirkei Avot, Abraham underwent ten tests at God&#x27;s command. The Binding of Isaac is specified in the Bible as a test; the other nine are not specified, but later rabbinical sources give various enumerations.

===Christianity===

In Christianity, Abraham is revered as the prophet to whom God chose to reveal himself and with whom God initiated a covenant (cf. &quot;Covenant Theology&quot;). Paul the Apostle declared that all who believe in Jesus (Christians) are &quot;included in the seed of Abraham and are inheritors of the promise made to Abraham.&quot; In Romans 4, Abraham is praised for his &quot;unwavering faith&quot; in God, which is tied into the concept of partakers of the covenant of grace being those &quot;who demonstrate faith in the saving power of Christ&quot;.

Throughout history, church leaders, following Paul, have emphasized Abraham as the spiritual father of all Christians. Augustine of Hippo declared that Christians are &quot;children (or &quot;seed&quot;) of Abraham by faith&quot;, Ambrose stated that &quot;by means of their faith Christians possess the promises made to Abraham&quot;, and Martin Luther recalled Abraham as &quot;a paradigm of the man of faith.&quot;

The Roman Catholic Church, the largest Christian denomination, calls Abraham &quot;our father in Faith&quot; in the Eucharistic prayer of the Roman Canon, recited during the Mass. He is also commemorated in the calendars of saints of several denominations: on 20 August by the Maronite Church, 28 August in the Coptic Church and the Assyrian Church of the East (with the full office for the latter), and on 9 October by the Roman Catholic Church and the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod. In the introduction to his 15th-century translation of the Golden Legend&#x27;s account of Abraham, William Caxton noted that this patriarch&#x27;s life was read in church on Quinquagesima Sunday.
He is the patron saint of those in the hospitality industry. The Eastern Orthodox Church commemorates him as the &quot;Righteous Forefather Abraham&quot;, with two feast days in its liturgical calendar. The first time is on 9 October (for those churches which follow the traditional Julian Calendar, 9 October falls on 22 October of the modern Gregorian Calendar), where he is commemorated together with his nephew &quot;Righteous Lot&quot;. The other is on the &quot;Sunday of the Forefathers&quot; (two Sundays before Christmas), when he is commemorated together with other ancestors of Jesus. Abraham is also mentioned in the Divine Liturgy of Basil the Great, just before the Anaphora, and Abraham and Sarah are invoked in the prayers said by the priest over a newly married couple. A popular hymn sung in many English-speaking Sunday Schools by children is known as &quot;Father Abraham&quot; and emphasizes the patriarch as the spiritual progenitor of Christians.

Some Christian theologians equate the &quot;three visitors&quot; with the Holy Trinity, seeing in their apparition a theophany experienced by Abraham (see also the articles on the Constantinian basilica at Mamre and the church at the so-called &quot;Oak of Mamre&quot;).

===Islam===

Islam regards Ibrahim (Abraham) as a link in the chain of prophets that begins with Adam and culminates in Muhammad via Ismail (Ishmael).
&quot;Ibrāhīm&quot; is mentioned in 35 chapters of the Quran, more often than any other biblical personage apart from Moses. He is called both a &quot;hanif&quot; (monotheist) and &quot;muslim&quot; (one who submits), and Muslims regard him as a prophet and patriarch, the archetype of the perfect Muslim, and the revered reformer of the Kaaba in Mecca. Islamic traditions consider Ibrāhīm the first Pioneer of Islam (which is also called &quot;millat Ibrahim&quot;, the &quot;religion of Abraham&quot;), and that his purpose and mission throughout his life was to proclaim the Oneness of God. In Islam, Abraham holds an exalted position among the major prophets and he is referred to as &quot;Ibrahim Khalilullah&quot;, meaning &quot;Abraham the Friend of God&quot;.

Besides Ishaq and Yaqub, Ibrahim is among the most honorable and the most excellent men in sight of God. Ibrahim was also mentioned in Quran as &quot;Father of Muslims&quot; and the role model for the community.

===Druze===
The Druze regard Abraham as the third spokesman (&quot;natiq&quot;) after Adam and Noah, who helped transmit the foundational teachings of monotheism (&quot;tawhid&quot;) intended for the larger audience. He is also among the seven prophets who appeared in different periods of history according to the Druze faith.

===Mandaeism===
In Mandaeism, Abraham () is mentioned in of the &quot;Right Ginza&quot; as the patriarch of the Jewish people. Mandaeans consider Abraham to have been originally a Mandaean priest, however they differ with Abraham and Jews regarding circumcision which they consider to be bodily mutilation and therefore forbidden.

=== Baháʼí Faith ===
Baháʼís considered Abraham as a Manifestation of God, and as the originator of monotheistic religion. ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá states that Abraham was born in Mesopotamia, and Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh states that the language which Abraham spoke, when &quot;he crossed the Jordan&quot;, is Hebrew (&quot;&#x27;Ibrání&quot;), so &quot;the language of the crossing.&quot; To ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá, the Abraham was born to a family that was ignorant of the oneness of God. Abraham opposed his own people and government, and even his own kin, he rejected all their gods, and, alone and single-handed, he withstood a powerful nation. These people believed not in one God but in many gods, to whom they ascribed miracles, and hence they all rose up against Abraham. No one supported him except his nephew Lot and &quot;one or two other individuals of no consequence&quot;. At last the intensity of his enemies&#x27; opposition obliged him, utterly wronged, to forsake his native land. Abraham then came to &quot;these regions&quot;, that is, to the Holy Land. To Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh, the &quot;Voice of God&quot; commanded Abraham to offer up Ishmael as a sacrifice, so that his steadfastness in the faith of God and his detachment from all else but him may be demonstrated unto men. The purpose of God, moreover, was to sacrifice him as a ransom for the sins and iniquities of all the peoples of the earth.

In the Baháʼí texts, like the Islamic texts, Abraham is often referred to as &quot;the Friend of God&quot;. &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá described Abraham as the founder of monotheism.

ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá also suggested the &quot;holy manifestations who have been the sources or founders of the various religious systems&quot; were united and agreed in purpose and teaching, and the Abraham, Moses, Zoroaster, the Buddha, Jesus, Muhammad, the Báb and Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh are one in &quot;spirit and reality&quot;.

== In the arts ==

===Painting and sculpture===
Paintings on the life of Abraham tend to focus on only a few incidents: the sacrifice of Isaac; meeting Melchizedek; entertaining the three angels; Hagar in the desert; and a few others. Additionally, Martin O&#x27;Kane, a professor of Biblical Studies, writes that the parable of Lazarus resting in the &quot;Bosom of Abraham&quot;, as described in the Gospel of Luke, became an iconic image in Christian works. According to O&#x27;Kane, artists often chose to divert from the common literary portrayal of Lazarus sitting next to Abraham at a banquet in Heaven and instead focus on the &quot;somewhat incongruous notion of Abraham, the most venerated of patriarchs, holding a naked and vulnerable child in his bosom&quot;. Several artists have been inspired by the life of Abraham, including Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528), Caravaggio (1573–1610), Donatello, Raphael, Philip van Dyck (Dutch painter, 1680–1753), and Claude Lorrain (French painter, 1600–1682). Rembrandt (Dutch, 1606–1669) created at least seven works on Abraham, Peter Paul Rubens (1577–1640) did several, Marc Chagall did at least five on Abraham, Gustave Doré (French illustrator, 1832–1883) did six, and James Tissot (French painter and illustrator, 1836–1902) did over twenty works on the subject.

The Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus depicts a set of biblical stories, including Abraham about to sacrifice Isaac. These sculpted scenes are on the outside of a marble Early Christian sarcophagus used for the burial of Junius Bassus. He died in 359. This sarcophagus has been described as &quot;probably the single most famous piece of early Christian relief sculpture.&quot; The sarcophagus was originally placed in or under Old St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, was rediscovered in 1597, and is now below the modern basilica in the Museo Storico del Tesoro della Basilica di San Pietro (Museum of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica) in the Vatican. The base is approximately . The Old Testament scenes depicted were chosen as precursors of Christ&#x27;s sacrifice in the New Testament, in an early form of typology. Just to the right of the middle is Daniel in the lion&#x27;s den and on the left is Abraham about to sacrifice Isaac.

George Segal created figural sculptures by molding plastered gauze strips over live models in his 1987 work &quot;Abraham&#x27;s Farewell to Ishmael&quot;. The human condition was central to his concerns, and Segal used the Old Testament as a source for his imagery. This sculpture depicts the dilemma faced by Abraham when Sarah demanded that he expel Hagar and Ishmael. In the sculpture, the father&#x27;s tenderness, Sarah&#x27;s rage, and Hagar&#x27;s resigned acceptance portray a range of human emotions. The sculpture was donated to the Miami Art Museum after the artist&#x27;s death in 2000.

===Christian iconography===

Abraham can sometimes be identified by the context of the image the meeting with Melchizedek, the three visitors, or the sacrifice of Isaac. In solo portraits a sword or knife may be used as his accessory, as in this statue by Giovanni Maria Morlaiter or this painting by Lorenzo Monaco. The Bible describes him as an &quot;older&quot; person.

As early as the beginning of the 3rd century, Christian art followed Christian typology in making the sacrifice of Isaac a foreshadowing of Christ&#x27;s sacrifice on the cross, and its memorial in the sacrifice of the Mass. See for example this 11th-century Christian altar engraved with Abraham&#x27;s and other sacrifices taken to prefigure that of Christ in the Eucharist.
Some early Christian writers interpreted the three visitors as the triune God. Thus in Santa Maria Maggiore, Rome, a 5th-century mosaic portrays only the visitors against a gold ground and puts semitransparent copies of them in the &quot;heavenly&quot; space above the scene. In Eastern Orthodox art, the visit is the chief means by which the Trinity is pictured (example). Some images do not include Abraham and Sarah, like Andrei Rublev&#x27;s &quot;Trinity&quot;, which shows only the three visitors as beardless youths at a table.

In some Orthodox icons, Abraham is portrayed as one of the biblical figures waiting for the Christians in Heaven after the Final Judgement.

===Literature===
&quot;Fear and Trembling&quot; (original Danish title: &quot;Frygt og Bæven&quot;) is an influential philosophical work by Søren Kierkegaard, published in 1843 under the pseudonym &quot;Johannes de silentio&quot; (&quot;John the Silent&quot;). Kierkegaard wanted to understand the anxiety that must have been present in Abraham when God asked him to sacrifice his son. W. G. Hardy&#x27;s novel &quot;Father Abraham&quot; (1935) tells the fictionalized life story of Abraham. In her short story collection &quot;Sarah and After&quot;, Lynne Reid Banks tells the story of Abraham and Sarah, with an emphasis on Sarah&#x27;s view of events.

=== Music ===
In 1681, Marc-Antoine Charpentier released a Dramatic motet (Oratorio), &quot;Sacrificim Abrahae&quot; H.402 – 402 a – 402 b, for soloists, chorus, doubling instruments and continuo. Sébastien de Brossard composed a cantata &quot;Abraham ou le sacrifice d&#x27;Isaac.&quot; between 1703 and 1708.

In 1994, Steve Reich released an opera named &quot;The Cave&quot;. The title refers to the Cave of the Patriarchs. The narrative of the opera is based on the story of Abraham, and his immediate family, as it is recounted in religious texts, and understood by individuals from different cultures and religious traditions.

Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot; is the title track for his 1965 album &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot;. In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked the song as number 364 in their 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. The song has five stanzas. In each stanza, someone describes an unusual problem that is ultimately resolved on Highway 61. In Stanza 1, God tells Abraham to &quot;kill me a son&quot;. God wants the killing done on Highway 61. Abram, the original name of the biblical Abraham, is also the name of Dylan&#x27;s own father.

<doc id="1437" wikidata="Q207730" url="?curid=1437" title="Abraxas">
<text>Abraxas (, variant form ) is a word of mystic meaning in the system of the Gnostic Basilides, being there applied to the &quot;Great Archon&quot; (), the princeps of the 365 spheres (). The word is found in Gnostic texts such as the &quot;Holy Book of the Great Invisible Spirit&quot;, and also appears in the Greek Magical Papyri. It was engraved on certain antique gemstones, called on that account Abraxas stones, which were used as amulets or charms. As the initial spelling on stones was (), the spelling of seen today probably originates in the confusion made between the Greek letters sigma (Σ) and xi (Ξ) in the Latin transliteration.

The seven letters spelling its name may represent each of the seven classic planets. The word may be related to &quot;Abracadabra&quot;, although other explanations exist.

There are similarities and differences between such figures in reports about Basilides&#x27;s teaching, ancient Gnostic texts, the larger Greco-Roman magical traditions, and modern magical and esoteric writings. Speculations have proliferated on Abraxas in recent centuries, which has been claimed to be both an Egyptian god and a demon.

== Etymology ==
Gaius Julius Hyginus (&quot;Fab&quot;. 183) gives &quot;Abrax Aslo Therbeeo&quot; as names of horses of the sun mentioned by &#x27;Homerus&#x27;. The passage is miserably corrupt, but it may not be accidental that the first three syllables make Abraxas.

The proper form of the name is evidently &quot;Abrasax&quot;, as with the Greek writers, Hippolytus, Epiphanius, Didymus (&quot;De Trin&quot;. iii. 42), and Theodoret; also Augustine and &quot;Praedestinatus&quot;; and in nearly all the legends on gems. By a probably euphonic inversion the translator of Irenaeus and the other Latin authors have &quot;Abraxas&quot;, which is found in the magical papyri, and even, though most sparingly, on engraved stones.

The attempts to discover a derivation for the name, Greek, Hebrew, Coptic, or other, have not been entirely successful:

=== Egyptian ===
Chuvash linguists, the word was translated as Ouroboros
* Claudius Salmasius (1588–1653) thought it Egyptian, but never gave the proofs which he promised.
*J. J. Bellermann thinks it is a compound of the Egyptian words &#x27; and &#x27;, meaning &quot;the honorable and hallowed word&quot;, or &quot;the word is adorable&quot;.
* Samuel Sharpe finds in it an Egyptian invocation to the Godhead, meaning &quot;hurt me not&quot;.

=== Hebrew ===
* Abraham Geiger sees in it a Grecized form of &#x27;, &quot;The Blessing.&quot; Charles William King supports this gloss, citing a similar translation of the word &quot;abracadabra&quot; as &#x27;, &quot;Pronounce the Blessing.&quot;
*J. B. Passerius derives it from &#x27;, &quot;father&quot;, &#x27;, &quot;to create&quot;, and &quot;&quot; negative—&quot;the uncreated Father&quot;.
*Giuseppe Barzilai goes back for explanation to the first verse of the prayer attributed to Nehunya ben HaKanah, the literal rendering of which is &quot;O [God], with thy mighty right hand deliver the unhappy [people]&quot;, forming from the initial and final letters of the words the word &quot;Abrakd&quot; (pronounced Abrakad), with the meaning &quot;the host of the winged ones&quot;, i.e., angels. While this theory can explain the mystic word &quot;Abracadabra&quot;, the association of this phrase with Abraxas is uncertain.

=== Greek ===
* Wendelin discovers a compound of the initial letters, amounting to 365 in numerical value, of four Hebrew and three Greek words, all written with Greek characters: (&quot;Father, Son, Spirit, holy; salvation from the cross&quot;).
*According to a note of Isaac de Beausobre&#x27;s, Jean Hardouin accepted the first three of these, taking the four others for the initials of the Greek &quot;&quot;, &quot;saving mankind by the holy cross&quot;.
* Isaac de Beausobre derives Abraxas from the Greek &#x27; and &#x27;, &quot;the beautiful, the glorious Savior&quot;.

Perhaps the word may be included among those mysterious expressions discussed by Adolf von Harnack, &quot;which belong to no known speech, and by their singular collocation of vowels and consonants give evidence that they belong to some mystic dialect, or take their origin from some supposed divine inspiration&quot;.

The Egyptian author of the book &quot;De Mysteriis&quot; in reply to Porphyry (vii. 4) admits a preference of &#x27;barbarous&#x27; to vernacular names in sacred things, urging a peculiar sanctity in the languages of certain nations, as the Egyptians and Assyrians; and Origen (&quot;Contra Cels&quot;. i. 24) refers to the &#x27;potent names&#x27; used by Egyptian sages, Persian Magi, and Indian Brahmins, signifying deities in the several languages.

== Sources ==
It is uncertain what the actual role and function of Abraxas was in the Basilidian system, as our authorities (see below) often show no direct acquaintance with the doctrines of Basilides himself.

=== As an archon ===
In the system described by Irenaeus, &quot;the Unbegotten Father&quot; is the progenitor of &quot;Nous&quot; &quot;Discerning Mind&quot;; &quot;Nous&quot; produced &quot;Logos&quot; &quot;Word, Reason&quot;; &quot;Logos&quot; produced &quot;Phronesis&quot; &quot;Mindfulness&quot;; &quot;Phronesis&quot; produced &quot;Sophia&quot; &quot;Wisdom&quot; and &quot;Dynamis&quot; &quot;Potentiality&quot;; &quot;Sophia&quot; and &quot;Dynamis&quot; produced the principalities, powers, and angels, the last of whom create &quot;the first heaven&quot;. They, in turn, originate a second series, who create a second heaven. The process continues in like manner until 365 heavens are in existence, the angels of the last or visible heaven being the authors of our world. &quot;The ruler&quot; [&quot;principem&quot;, i.e., probably &quot;ton archonta&quot;] of the 365 heavens &quot;is Abraxas, and for this reason he contains within himself 365 numbers&quot;.

The name occurs in the &quot;Refutation of All Heresies&quot; (vii. 26) by Hippolytus, who appears in these chapters to have followed the &quot;Exegetica&quot; of Basilides. After describing the manifestation of the Gospel in the Ogdoad and Hebdomad, he adds that the Basilidians have a long account of the innumerable creations and powers in the several &#x27;stages&#x27; of the upper world (&quot;diastemata&quot;), in which they speak of 365 heavens and say that &quot;their great archon&quot; is Abrasax, because his name contains the number 365, the number of the days in the year; i.e. the sum of the numbers denoted by the Greek letters in ΑΒΡΑΣΑΞ according to the rules of isopsephy is 365:

=== As a god ===
Epiphanius (&quot;Haer&quot;. 69, 73 f.) appears to follow partly Irenaeus, partly the lost Compendium of Hippolytus. He designates Abraxas more distinctly as &quot;the power above all, and First Principle&quot;, &quot;the cause and first archetype&quot; of all things; and mentions that the Basilidians referred to 365 as the number of parts (&quot;mele&quot;) in the human body, as well as of days in the year.

The author of the appendix to Tertullian &quot;De Praescr. Haer&quot;. (c. 4), who likewise follows Hippolytus&#x27;s Compendium, adds some further particulars; that &#x27;Abraxas&#x27; gave birth to Mind (&quot;nous&quot;), the first in the series of primary powers enumerated likewise by Irenaeus and Epiphanius; that the world, as well as the 365 heavens, was created in honour of &#x27;Abraxas&#x27;; and that Christ was sent not by the Maker of the world but by &#x27;Abraxas&#x27;.

Nothing can be built on the vague allusions of Jerome, according to whom &#x27;Abraxas&#x27; meant for Basilides &quot;the greatest God&quot; (&quot;De vir. ill&quot;. 21), &quot;the highest God&quot; (&quot;Dial. adv. Lucif&quot;. 23), &quot;the Almighty God&quot; (&quot;Comm. in Amos&quot; iii. 9), and &quot;the Lord the Creator&quot; (&quot;Comm. in Nah&quot;. i. 11). The notices in Theodoret (&quot;Haer. fab&quot;. i. 4), Augustine (&quot;Haer&quot;. 4), and &#x27;Praedestinatus&#x27; (i. 3), have no independent value.

It is evident from these particulars that Abrasax was the name of the first of the 365 Archons, and accordingly stood below Sophia and Dynamis and their progenitors; but his position is not expressly stated, so that the writer of the supplement to Tertullian had some excuse for confusing him with &quot;the Supreme God&quot;.

=== As an aeon ===
With the availability of primary sources, such as those in the Nag Hammadi library, the identity of Abraxas remains unclear. The &quot;Holy Book of the Great Invisible Spirit&quot;, for instance, refers to Abraxas as an Aeon dwelling with Sophia and other Aeons of the Pleroma in the light of the luminary Eleleth. In several texts, the luminary Eleleth is the last of the luminaries (Spiritual Lights) that come forward, and it is the Aeon Sophia, associated with Eleleth, who encounters darkness and becomes involved in the chain of events that leads to the Demiurge&#x27;s rule of this world, and the salvage effort that ensues. As such, the role of Aeons of Eleleth, including Abraxas, Sophia, and others, pertains to this outer border of the Pleroma that encounters the ignorance of the world of Lack and interacts to rectify the error of ignorance in the world of materiality.

=== As a demon ===
The Catholic church later deemed Abraxas a pagan god, and ultimately branded him a demon as documented in J. Collin de Plancy&#x27;s &quot;Infernal Dictionary&quot;, Abraxas (or Abracax) is labeled the &quot;supreme God&quot; of the Basilidians, whom he describes as &quot;heretics of the second century&quot;. He further indicated the Basilidians attributed to Abraxas the rule over &quot;365 skies&quot; and &quot;365 virtues&quot;. In a final statement on Basilidians, de Plancy states that their view was that Jesus Christ was merely a &quot;benevolent ghost sent on Earth by Abraxas&quot;.

== Abraxas stones ==
A vast number of engraved stones are in existence, to which the name &quot;Abraxas-stones&quot; has long been given. One particularly fine example was included as part of the Thetford treasure from fourth century Norfolk, England. The subjects are mythological, and chiefly grotesque, with various inscriptions, in which ΑΒΡΑΣΑΞ often occurs, alone or with other words. Sometimes the whole space is taken up with the inscription. In certain obscure magical writings of Egyptian origin ἀβραξάς or ἀβρασάξ is found associated with other names which frequently accompany it on gems; it is also found on the Greek metal tesseræ among other mystic words. The meaning of the legends is seldom intelligible: but some of the gems are amulets; and the same may be the case with nearly all.

*The Abraxas-image alone, without external Iconisms, and either without, or but a simple, inscription. The Abrasax-imago proper is usually found with a shield, a sphere or wreath and whip, a sword or sceptre, a cock&#x27;s head, the body clad with armor, and a serpent&#x27;s tail. There are, however, innumerable modifications of these figures: Lions&#x27;, hawks&#x27;, and eagles&#x27; skins, with or without mottos, with or without a trident and star, and with or without reverses.
*Abraxas &quot;combined&quot; with other Gnostic Powers. If, in a single instance, this supreme being was represented in connection with powers of subordinate rank, nothing could have been more natural than to represent it also in combination with its emanations, the seven superior spirits, the thirty Aeons, and the three hundred and sixty-five cosmical Genii; and yet this occurs upon none of the relics as yet discovered, whilst those with Powers not belonging to the Gnostic system are frequently met with.
*Abraxas with Jewish symbols. This combination predominates, not indeed with symbolical figures, but in the form of inscriptions, such as: &quot;Iao, Eloai, Adonai, Sabaoth, Michael, Gabriel, Uriel, Onoel, Ananoel, Raphael, Japlael&quot;, and many others. The name ΙΑΩ, to which ΣΑΒΑΩΘ is sometimes added, is found with this figure even more frequently than ΑΒΡΑΣΑΞ, and they are often combined. Beside an Abrasax figure the following, for instance, is found: ΙΑΩ ΑΒΡΑΣΑΞ ΑΔΩΝ ΑΤΑ, &quot;Iao Abrasax, thou art the Lord&quot;. With the Abrasax-shield are also found the divine names Sabaoth Iao, Iao Abrasax, Adonai Abrasax, etc.
*Abraxas with Persian deities. Chiefly, perhaps exclusively, in combination with Mithras, and possibly a few specimens with the mystical gradations of &quot;mithriaca&quot;, upon Gnostic relics.
*Abraxas with Egyptian deities. It is represented as a figure, with the sun-god Phre leading his chariot, or standing upon a lion borne by a crocodile; also as a name, in connection with Isis, Phtha, Neith, Athor, Thot, Anubis, Horus, and Harpocrates in a Lotus-leaf; also with a representation of the Nile, the symbol of prolificacy, with Agathodaemon (Chnuphis), or with scarabs, the symbols of the revivifying energies of nature.
*Abraxas with Grecian deities, sometimes as a figure, and again with the simple name, in connection with the planets, especially Venus, Hecate, and Zeus, richly engraved.
*Simple or ornamental representations of the journey of departed spirits through the starry world to Amenti, borrowed, as those above-named, from the Egyptian religion. The spirit wafted from the earth, either with or without the corpse, and transformed at times into Osiris or Helios, is depicted as riding upon the back of a crocodile, or lion, guided in some instances by Anubis, and other genii, and surrounded by stars; and thus attended hastening to judgment and a higher life.
*Representations of the judgment, which, like the preceding, are either ornamental or plain, and imitations of Egyptian art, with slight modifications and prominent symbols, as the vessel in which Anubis weighs the human heart, as comprehending the entire life of man, with all its errors.
*Worship and consecrating services were, according to the testimony of Origen in his description of the ophitic diagram, conducted with figurative representations in the secret assemblies of the Gnostics unless indeed the statement on which this opinion rests designates, as it readily may, a statue of glyptic workmanship. It is uncertain if any of the discovered specimens actually represent the Gnostic cultus and religious ceremonies, although upon some may be seen an Abrasax-figure laying its hand upon a person kneeling, as though for baptism or benediction.
*Astrological groups. The Gnostics referred everything to astrology. Even the Bardesenists located the inferior powers, the seven, twelve and thirty-six, among the planets, in the zodiac and starry region, as rulers of the celestial phenomena which influence the earth and its inhabitants. Birth and health, wealth and allotment, are considered to be mainly under their control. Other sects betray still stronger partiality for astrological conceits. Many of these specimens also are improperly ascribed to Gnosticism, but the Gnostic origin of others is too manifest to allow of contradiction.
*Inscriptions, of which there are three kinds:
**Those destitute of symbols or iconisms, engraved upon stone, iron, lead and silver plates, in Greek, Latin, Coptic or other languages, of amuletic import, and in the form of prayers for health and protection.
**Those with some symbol, as a serpent in an oval form.
**Those with iconisms, at times very small, but often made the prominent object, so that the legend is limited to a single word or name. Sometimes the legends are as important as the images. It is remarkable, however, that thus far none of the plates or medals found seem to have any of the forms or prayers reported by Origen. It is necessary to distinguish those specimens that belong to the proper Gnostic period from such as are indisputably of later origin, especially since there is a strong temptation to place those of more recent date among the older class.

=== Anguipede ===

In a great majority of instances the name Abraxas is associated with a singular composite figure, having a Chimera-like appearance somewhat resembling a basilisk or the Greek primordial god Chronos (not to be confused with the Greek titan Cronus). According to E. A. Wallis Budge, &quot;as a Pantheus, i.e. All-God, he appears on the amulets with the head of a cock (Phœbus) or of a lion (Ra or Mithras), the body of a man, and his legs are serpents which terminate in scorpions, types of the Agathodaimon. In his right hand he grasps a club, or a flail, and in his left is a round or oval shield.&quot; This form was also referred to as the Anguipede. Budge surmised that Abrasax was &quot;a form of the Adam Kadmon of the Kabbalists and the Primal Man whom God made in His own image&quot;.

Some parts at least of the figure mentioned above are solar symbols, and the Basilidian Abrasax is manifestly connected with the sun. J. J. Bellermann has speculated that &quot;the whole represents the Supreme Being, with his Five great Emanations, each one pointed out by means of an expressive emblem. Thus, from the human body, the usual form assigned to the Deity, forasmuch as it is written that God created man in his own image, issue the two supporters, &quot;Nous&quot; and &quot;Logos&quot;, symbols of the inner sense and the quickening understanding, as typified by the serpents, for the same reason that had induced the old Greeks to assign this reptile for an attribute to Pallas. His head—a cock&#x27;s—represents &quot;Phronesis&quot;, the fowl being emblematical of foresight and vigilance. His two hands bear the badges of &quot;Sophia&quot; and &quot;Dynamis&quot;, the shield of Wisdom, and the scourge of Power.&quot;

=== Origin ===
In the absence of other evidence to show the origin of these curious relics of antiquity the occurrence of a name known as Basilidian on patristic authority has not unnaturally been taken as a sufficient mark of origin, and the early collectors and critics assumed this whole group to be the work of Gnostics. During the last three centuries attempts have been made to sift away successively those gems that had no claim to be considered in any sense Gnostic, or specially Basilidian, or connected with Abrasax. The subject is one which has exercised the ingenuity of many savants, but it may be said that all the engraved stones fall into three classes:
* &quot;Abraxas&quot;, or stones of Basilidian origin
* &quot;Abraxastes&quot;, or stones originating in ancient forms of worship and adapted by the Gnostics
* &quot;Abraxoïdes&quot;, or stones absolutely unconnected with the doctrine of Basilides

While it would be rash to assert positively that no existing gems were the work of Gnostics, there is no valid reason for attributing all of them to such an origin. The fact that the name occurs on these gems in connection with representations of figures with the head of a cock, a lion, or an ass, and the tail of a serpent was formerly taken in the light of what Irenaeus says about the followers of Basilides:

Incantations by mystic names were characteristic of the hybrid Gnosticism planted in Spain and southern Gaul at the end of the fourth century and at the beginning of the fifth, which Jerome connects with Basilides and which (according to his &quot;Epist&quot;., lxxv.) used the name Abraxas.

It is therefore not unlikely that some Gnostics used amulets, though the confident assertions of modern writers to this effect rest on no authority. Isaac de Beausobre properly calls attention to the significant silence of Clement in the two passages in which he instructs the Christians of Alexandria on the right use of rings and gems, and the figures which may legitimately be engraved on them (&quot;Paed&quot;. 241 ff.; 287 ff.). But no attempt to identify the figures on existing gems with the personages of Gnostic mythology has had any success, and &quot;Abraxas&quot; is the only Gnostic term found in the accompanying legends that is not known to belong to other religions or mythologies. The present state of the evidence therefore suggests that their engravers and the Basilidians received the mystic name from a common source now unknown.

=== Magical papyri ===
Having due regard to the magic papyri, in which many of the unintelligible names of the Abrasax-stones reappear, besides directions for making and using gems with similar figures and formulas for magical purposes, it can scarcely be doubted that many of these stones are pagan amulets and instruments of magic.

The magic papyri reflect the same ideas as the Abrasax-gems and often bear Hebraic names of God. The following example is illustrative: &quot;I conjure you by Iaō Sabaōth Adōnai Abrasax, and by the great god, Iaeō&quot;. The patriarchs are sometimes addressed as deities; for which fact many instances may be adduced. In the group &quot;Iakoubia, Iaōsabaōth Adōnai Abrasax&quot;, the first name seems to be composed of Jacob and Ya. Similarly, entities considered angels in Judaism are invoked as gods alongside Abrasax: thus &quot;I conjure you ... by the god Michaēl, by the god Souriēl, by the god Gabriēl, by the god Raphaēl, by the god Abrasax Ablathanalba Akrammachari ...&quot;.

In text PGM V. 96–172, Abraxas is identified as part of the &quot;true name which has been transmitted to the prophets of Israel&quot; of the &quot;Headless One, who created heaven and earth, who created night and day ... Osoronnophris whom none has ever seen ... awesome and invisible god with an empty spirit&quot;; the name also includes Iaō and Adōnai. &quot;Osoronnophris&quot; represents Egyptian &quot;Wsir &quot;, &quot;Osiris the Perfect Being&quot;. Another identification with Osiris is made in PGM VII. 643-51: &quot;you are not wine, but the guts of Osiris, the guts of ... Ablanathanalba Akrammachamarei Eee, who has been stationed over necessity, Iakoub Ia Iaō Sabaōth Adōnai Abrasax.&quot; PGM VIII. 1-63, on the other hand, identifies Abraxas as a name of &quot;Hermes&quot; (i.e. Thoth). Here the numerological properties of the name are invoked, with its seven letters corresponding to the seven planets and its isopsephic value of 365 corresponding to the days of the year. Thoth is also identified with Abrasax in PGM LXXIX. 1-7: &quot;I am the soul of darkness, Abrasax, the eternal one, Michaēl, but my true name is Thōouth, Thōouth.&quot;

One papyrus titled the &quot;Monad&quot; or the &quot;Eighth Book of Moses&quot; (PGM XIII. 1–343) contains an invocation to a supreme creator God; Abraxas is given as being the name of this God in the language of the baboons. The papyrus goes on to describe a cosmogonic myth about Abraxas, describing how he created the Ogdoad by laughing. His first laughter created light; his second divided the primordial waters; his third created the mind; his fourth created fertility and procreation; his fifth created fate; his sixth created time (as the sun and moon); and his seventh and final laughter created the soul. Then, from various sounds made by Abrasax, there arose the serpent Python who &quot;foreknew all things&quot;, the first man (or Fear), and the god Iaō, &quot;who is lord of all&quot;. The man fought with Iaō, and Abrasax declared that Iaō&#x27;s power would derive from both of the others, and that Iaō would take precedence over all the other gods. This text also describes Helios as an archangel of God/Abrasax.

The Leyden Papyrus recommends that this invocation be pronounced to the moon:

The magic word &quot;Ablanathanalba&quot;, which reads in Greek the same backward as forward, also occurs in the Abraxas-stones as well as in the magic papyri. This word is usually conceded to be derived from the Hebrew (Aramaic), meaning &quot;Thou art our father&quot; (אב לן את), and also occurs in connection with Abraxas; the following inscription is found upon a metal plate in the Karlsruhe Museum:

<doc id="1438" wikidata="Q205372" url="?curid=1438" title="Absalom">
<text>Absalom ( , ), according to the Hebrew Bible, was an Israelite prince. Born to David and Maacah, who was from Geshur, he was the only full sibling of Tamar. He is described in the Hebrew Bible as being exceptionally beautiful, as is his sister. In the narrative of 2 Samuel 13, his sister Tamar takes refuge at his house after she is raped by their paternal half-brother Amnon (born to David and Ahinoam, who was from Jezreel); David is angered by the incident, but does nothing, as Amnon is his heir apparent. Infuriated by the rape and David&#x27;s inaction, Absalom assassinates Amnon and subsequently flees to Geshur, which is ruled by his and Tamar&#x27;s maternal grandfather Talmai.

Following three years in exile, he returns to Israel and rallies popular support against the House of David. A war ensues when Absalom&#x27;s rebels mobilize at Hebron and begin fighting David&#x27;s army in an attempt to overthrow him, but their revolt ends in failure when Absalom is killed by David&#x27;s nephew and army commander Joab during the Battle of the Wood of Ephraim. In the aftermath of his death, Absalom&#x27;s sister is described as being left &quot;a desolate woman in her brother&#x27;s house&quot; and the sole guardian of his orphaned daughter, who is also named Tamar.

==Biblical narrative==
===Background===
Absalom, David&#x27;s third son, by Maacah, was born in Hebron. At an early age, he moved, along with the transfer of the capital, to Jerusalem, where he spent most of his life. He was a great favorite of his father and of the people. His charming manners, personal beauty, insinuating ways, love of pomp, and royal pretensions captivated the hearts of the people from the beginning. He lived in great style, drove in a magnificent chariot, and had fifty men run before him.

Little is known of Absalom&#x27;s family life, but the biblical narrative states that he had three sons and one daughter, Tamar, who is described as a beautiful woman. From the language of 2 Samuel 18:18, Absalom states, &quot;I have no son to keep my name in remembrance&quot;. It may be that his sons died before his statement, or, as Matthew Henry suggests, Absalom&#x27;s three sons may have been born &quot;after&quot; his statement.

Aside from his daughter Tamar, Absalom had another daughter or granddaughter, Maacah, who later became the favorite wife of Rehoboam. Maacah was the mother of Abijah of Judah and the grandmother of Asa of Judah. She served as queen mother for Asa until he deposed her for idolatry.

===Murder of Amnon===


Absalom also had a sister named Tamar, who was raped by her half-brother Amnon, David&#x27;s eldest son. Absalom waited two years after the rape for vengeance, sending his servants to murder a drunken Amnon at a feast to which Absalom had invited all of King David&#x27;s sons.

After this murder, Absalom fled to his maternal grandfather Talmai, the king of Geshur. Not until three years later was Absalom fully reinstated in David&#x27;s favour and finally returned to Jerusalem.

===The revolt at Hebron===
In Jerusalem, Absalom built support for himself by speaking to those who came to King David for justice, saying, &quot;See, your claims are good and right; but there is no one deputed by the king to hear you&quot;, perhaps reflecting flaws in the judicial system of the united monarchy. &quot;If only I were the judge of the land! Then all who had a suit or cause might come to me, and I would give them justice.&quot; He made gestures of flattery by kissing those who bowed before him instead of accepting supplication. He &quot;stole the hearts of the people of Israel&quot;.

After four years, he declared himself king, raised a revolt at Hebron, the former capital, and publicly raped his father&#x27;s ten concubines. It is said that this was God punishing David for his sin with Bathsheba tenfold. All Israel and Judah flocked to him, and David, attended only by the Cherethites and Pelethites and his former bodyguard, which had followed him from Gath, found it expedient to flee. The priests Zadok and Abiathar remained in Jerusalem, and their sons Jonathan and Ahimaaz served as David&#x27;s spies. Absalom reached the capital and consulted with the renowned Ahitophel (sometimes spelled Achitophel). It is also speculated that Ahitophel could have joined Absalom&#x27;s cause as David had previously committed adultery with his granddaughter, Bathsheba.

David took refuge from Absalom&#x27;s forces beyond the Jordan River. However, he took the precaution of instructing a servant, Hushai, to infiltrate Absalom&#x27;s court and subvert it. Once in place, Hushai convinced Absalom to ignore Ahitophel&#x27;s advice to attack his father while he was on the run, and instead to prepare his forces for a major attack. This gave David critical time to prepare his own troops for the battle. When Ahitophel saw that his advice was not followed, he committed suicide by hanging himself.

===Battle of Ephraim&#x27;s Wood===
A fateful battle was fought in the Wood of Ephraim (the name suggests a locality west of the Jordan) and Absalom&#x27;s army was completely routed. When Absalom fled from David&#x27;s army, his head was caught in the boughs of an oak tree as the mule he was riding ran beneath it. He was discovered there still alive by one of David&#x27;s men, who reported this to Joab, the king&#x27;s commander. Joab, accustomed to avenging himself, took this opportunity to even the score with Absalom. Absalom had once set Joab&#x27;s field of barley on fire and then made Amasa Captain of the Host instead of Joab. Killing Absalom was against David&#x27;s explicit command, &quot;Beware that none touch the young man Absalom&quot;. Joab injured Absalom with three darts through the heart and Absalom was subsequently killed by ten of Joab&#x27;s armor-bearers.

When David heard that Absalom was killed, although not how he was killed, he greatly sorrowed.

David withdrew to the city of Mahanaim in mourning, until Joab roused him from &quot;the extravagance of his grief&quot; and called on him to fulfill his duty to his people.

===Memorial===
Absalom had erected a monument near Jerusalem to perpetuate his name:

An ancient monument in the Kidron Valley near the Old City of Jerusalem, known as the Tomb of Absalom or Absalom&#x27;s Pillar and traditionally identified as the monument of the biblical narrative, is now dated by modern archeologists to the first century AD. The Jewish Encyclopedia reports: &quot;A tomb twenty feet high and twenty-four feet square, which late tradition points out as the resting-place of Absalom. It is situated in the eastern part of the valley of Kidron, to the east of Jerusalem. In all probability it is the tomb of Alexander Jannæus (Conder, in Hastings&#x27; &quot;Dict. Bible&quot;, article &quot;Jerusalem&quot;, p. 597). It existed in the days of Josephus. However, archaeologists have now dated the tomb to the 1st century AD. In a 2013 conference, Professor Gabriel Barkay suggested that it could be the tomb of Herod Agrippa, the grandson of Herod the Great, based in part on the similarity to Herod&#x27;s newly discovered tomb at Herodium. For centuries, it was the custom among passers-by—Jews, Christians and Muslims—to throw stones at the monument. Residents of Jerusalem would bring their unruly children to the site to teach them what became of a rebellious son.

==Rabbinic literature==
The explanation in Rabbanic Literature about why Ahithophel had advised Absalom to act against his father: The Talmud speaks of this counsellor of David as &quot;a man, like Balaam, whose great wisdom was not received in humility as a gift from heaven, and so became a stumbling block to him.&quot; He was &quot;one of those who, while casting longing eyes upon things not belonging to them, also lose the things they possess.&quot; Accordingly, Ahithophel was granted access by Almighty God into the Divine powers of God. And being thus familiar with Divine wisdom and knowledge as imparted through the Holy Spirit, he was consulted as an oracle like the Urim and Thummim. &quot;..and great as was his wisdom, it was equalled by his scholarship. Therefore, David did not hesitate to submit himself to his instruction, even though Ahithophel was a very young
man at his death, not more than thirty-three years old. The one thing lacking in him was sincere piety, which proved his undoing in the end, for it induced him to participate in Absalom&#x27;s rebellion against David. Thus, he forfeited even his share in the world to come. 
To this dire course of action, he was misled by astrology and other signs, which he interpreted as prophecies of his kingship when in reality, they pointed to the royal destiny of his granddaughter Bath-sheba. Possessed by his erroneous belief, he cunningly urged Absalom to commit an unheard-of crime. Thus, Absalom would profit nothing by his rebellion, for, though he accomplished his father&#x27;s ruin, he would yet be held to account and condemned to death for his violation of family purity, and the way to the throne would be clear for Ahithophel, the great sage in Israel.&quot; 
The life and death of Absalom offered to the rabbis a welcome theme wherewith to warn the people against false ambition, vainglory, and unfilial conduct. The vanity with which he displayed his beautiful hair, the rabbis say, became his snare and his stumbling-block. &quot;By his long hair the Nazirite entangled the people to rebel against his father, and by it he himself became entangled, to fall a victim to his pursuers&quot;. And again, elsewhere: &quot;By his vile stratagem he deceived and stole three hearts, that of his father, of the elders, and finally of the whole nation of Israel, and for this reason three darts were thrust into his heart to end his treacherous life&quot;. More striking is the following: &quot;Did one ever hear of an oak-tree having a heart? And yet in the oak-tree in whose branches Absalom was caught, we read that upon its heart he was held up still alive while the darts were thrust through him. This is to show that when a man becomes so heartless as to make war against his own father, nature itself takes on a heart to avenge the deed.&quot;

&quot;The knowledge that a part of Absalom&#x27;s following sided with him in secret,--that, though he was pursued by his son, his friends remained true to him,--somewhat consoled David in his distress. He thought that in these circumstances, if the worst came to the worst, Absalom would at least feel pity for him. At first, however, the despair of David knew no bounds. He was on the point of worshipping an idol, when his friend Hushai the Archite approached him, saying: &quot;The people will wonder that such a king should serve idols.&quot; David replied: &quot;Should a king such as I am be killed by his own son? It is better for me to serve idols than that God should be held responsible for my misfortune, and His Name thus be desecrated.&quot; Hushai reproached him: &quot;Why didst thou marry a captive?&quot; &quot;There is no wrong in that,&quot; replied David, &quot;it is permitted according to the law.&quot; Thereupon Hushai: &quot;But thou didst disregard the connection between the passage permitting it and the one that follows almost immediately after it in the Scriptures, dealing with the disobedient and rebellious son, the natural issue of such a marriage.&quot; Absalom&#x27;s end was beset with terrors. When he was caught in the branches of the oak-tree, he was about to sever his hair with a sword stroke, but suddenly he saw hell yawning beneath him, and he preferred to hang in the tree to throwing himself into the abyss alive. Absalom&#x27;s crime was, indeed, of a nature to deserve the supreme torture, for which reason he is one of the few Jews who have no portion in the world to come.

Popular legend states that the eye of Absalom was of immense size, signifying his insatiable greed. Indeed, &quot;hell itself opened beneath him, and David, his father, cried seven times: &#x27;My son! my son!&#x27; while bewailing his death, praying at the same time for his redemption from the seventh section of Gehenna, to which he was consigned&quot;. According to R. Meir, &quot;he has no share in the life to come&quot;. And according to the description of Gehenna by Joshua ben Levi, who, like Dante, wandered through hell under the guidance of the angel Duma, Absalom still dwells there, having the rebellious heathen in charge; and when the angels with their fiery rods run also against Absalom to smite him like the rest, a heavenly voice says: &quot;Spare Absalom, the son of David, My servant.&quot; &quot;That the extreme penalties of hell were thus averted from him, was on account of David&#x27;s eightfold repetition of his son&#x27;s name in his lament over him. Besides, David&#x27;s intercession had the effect of re-attaching Absalom&#x27;s severed head to his body. An account of Joshua Ben Levi going to the fifth compartment of PAradise reports:&quot;The fifth compartment is of silver, and gold, and refined gold, and of crystal, and bdellium; and through its midst flows the river Gihon. The walls are of silver and gold, and a perfume breathes through it more exquisite than the perfume of Lebanon. And beds of silver and gold are there prepared, covered with violet and purple covers, woven by Eve, and mixed with scarlet and made of hair of goats, woven by angels. Here dwell the Messiah and Elijah in a palanquin of the wood of Lebanon; the pillars thereof of silver, the bottom thereof of gold, the seat of it of purple. Herein lieth the Messiah, the son of David, who is the love of the daughters of Jerusalem, the midst thereof is love. The prophet Elijah takes the head of the Messiah and places it in his bosom and says to him: &quot;Be quiet and wait, for the end draweth nigh.&quot; On every Monday and Thursday and Saturday and Holiday the Patriarchs come to him and the fathers of the Tribes and Moses and Aaron and David and Solomon and every king of Israel and of the house of Judah, and they weep with him and comfort him, and say unto him: &quot;Be quiet and wait and rely upon thy Creator, for the end draweth nigh.&quot; Also Korah and his company and Dathan and Abiram and Absalom come to him on every Wednesday, and ask him: &quot;When will the end of our misery come? When wilt thou reveal thyself?&quot;16. He answereth them and says: &quot;Go to your fathers and ask them.&quot; And when they hear of their fathers they feel ashamed and do not ask any further.King David’s prayers granted his rebellious son Avshalom access to the World to Come At his death Absalom was childless, for all his children, his three sons and his daughter, died before him, as a punishment for his having set fire to a field of grain belonging to Joab.&quot; Although Absalom avenged his sister defilement by Amnon ironically he proved himself not to be very much different from Amnon. As Amnon had sought the advice of Jonadab in order to rape Tamar, Absalom had sought the advice of Ahitophel who advised Absalom to have incestuous relations with his father&#x27;s concubines in order to show all Israel how odious he was to his father [2 Samuel 16:20] .Likewise as Amnon had brought two curses on himself for incest with his half sister and failing to fulfill the Torah Law, Absalom brought four curses on himself for dishonoring his father; relations with his father&#x27;s wives [concubines]; and failing to fulfill the Torah Law twice. [Deuteronomy 27:20 26] The Rabbis explain that the concubines were not punished by G-d. They were violated by Absalom. Absalom with his own free will, choose to do that. It is true G-d created a world where we humans can choose good or evil, but the choice in the end remains ours. Although G-d had told David that his wives would be taken, he did not ordain or force Absalom to violate them. He just foretold it. Is A lesson to be learned of the consequences from Absalom life is that his lust for power was so deep that he engaged in acts of chillul hashem and brought upon himself 4 curses from the Torah? (Dishonoring his father by his revolt; dishonoring his father&#x27;s wives; and twice bring curses on himself for not fulfilling the Torah law)?Yes. He was a prince who could had almost anything. The only things he wanted were things he could not have. He lusted after his sister and his father&#x27;s throne. Wealth is not determined by possessions but by mindset. In his mind, Absalom was a pauper. He only looked at what he did not have.

===Fiction===
* In the 1946 short story &quot;Absalom&quot; by C.L. Moore and Henry Kuttner, the character Absalom is a child prodigy, who does non-consensual brain surgery on his father (a former child prodigy, though not as intelligent as his son) to make the father totally focused on Absalom&#x27;s success. This relates to the Biblical story of the son usurping his father.

* Throughout Robertson Davies&#x27;s &quot;The Manticore&quot; a comparison is repeatedly made between the protagonist&#x27;s problematic relations with his father and those of the Biblical Absalom and King David. Paradoxically, in the modern version, it is the rebellious son who has the first name &quot;David&quot;. The book also introduces the term &quot;Absalonism&quot;, as a generic term for a son&#x27;s rebellion against his father.
* Absalom appears as a prominent character in Peter Shaffer&#x27;s play &quot;Yonadab&quot;, which portrays Amnon&#x27;s rape of Tamar and his murder at Absalom&#x27;s hands.
* A scene in the Swedish writer Frans G. Bengtsson&#x27;s historical novel &quot;The Long Ships&quot; depicts a 10th Century Christian missionary recounting the story of Absalom&#x27;s rebellion to the assembled Danish court, including the aging King Harald Bluetooth and his son Sweyn Forkbeard; thereupon, King Harald exclaims &quot;Some people can learn a lesson from this story!&quot;, casting a meaningful glance at his son Sweyn—whom the King (rightly) suspects of plotting a rebellion.
* In the novel &quot;The Book of Tamar&quot; by Nel Havas, the story of Absalom is presented from the viewpoint of his sister. While closely following the main events as related in the Bible, Havas concentrates on the motives behind Absalom&#x27;s actions, which Havas presents as more complex than depicted in the scriptures.
* In the novel &quot;Ender&#x27;s Shadow&quot; by Orson Scott Card, the main character Bean invokes the quote to give solace to the kamikaze pilots Ender had unknowingly sent to their deaths to defeat the Formics.
*The role played by luxuriant hair in the death of Absalom is referenced to telling effect in the ghost story The Diary of Mr Poynter by master of the genre M.R. James. The ghost in question is that of dissolute young nobleman Sir Everard Charlett, known to his Oxford University cronies by the nickname Absalom, on account of his beautiful, long hair and debauched lifestyle. Sir Everard has commemorated his flowing locks by the unusual expedient of having them portrayed in a wallpaper pattern, which later proves to have the power to summon his malign, hair-covered ghost - much to the horror of James&#x27;s unfortunate protagonist, Mr. James Denton.

===Music===
* Josquin des Prez composed the motet &quot;Absalon, fili mi&quot; on the occasion of the death of Juan Borgia (Absalon being a further alternative spelling).
* Nicholas Gombert composed the two-part, eight-voice motet &quot;Lugebat David Absalon&quot;.
* Heinrich Schütz (1585–1672) composed &quot;Fili mi, Absalon&quot; as part of his Sinfoniae Sacrae, op. 6.
* The single verse, 2 Samuel 18:33, regarding David&#x27;s grief at the loss of his son (&quot;And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!&quot;), is the inspiration for the text of several pieces of choral music, usually entitled &quot;When David Heard&quot; (such as those by Renaissance composers Thomas Tomkins and Thomas Weelkes, or modern composers Eric Whitacre, Joshua Shank, and Norman Dinerstein). This verse is also used in &quot;David&#x27;s Lamentation&quot; by William Billings, first published in 1778.
* Leonard Cohen&#x27;s poem &quot;Prayer for Sunset&quot; compares the setting sun to the raving Absalom, and asks whether another Joab will arrive tomorrow night to kill Absalom again.
* &quot;Absalom, Absalom&quot; is a song on the 1996 Compass CD &quot;Making Light of It&quot; by singer/songwriter Pierce Pettis, incorporating several elements of the biblical narrative.
* The Australian composer Nigel Butterley set the verse in his 2008 choral work &quot;Beni Avshalom&quot;, commissioned by the Sydney Chamber Choir.
* During the finale of the song &quot;Distant Early Warning&quot; by Canadian band Rush, Geddy Lee sings, &quot;Absalom, Absalom, Absalom&quot;; lyrics written by drummer Neil Peart.

* The San Francisco–based band Om mentions Absalom in their song &quot;Kapila&#x27;s Theme&quot; from their debut album &quot;Variations on a Theme&quot;.
* The garage folk band David&#x27;s Doldrums references Absalom in their song, &quot;My Name Is Absalom&quot;. The song alludes to Absalom&#x27;s feelings of solemnity and abandonment of love and hope.
* In &quot;Every Kind Word&quot; by Lackthereof, Danny Seim&#x27;s project parallel to Menomena, Seim sings &quot;... and your hair is long like Absalom.&quot;
* &quot;Barach Hamelech&quot;, an Israeli song by Amos Etinger and Yosef Hadar.

* &quot;Absalom&quot; is a song on Brand New Shadows&#x27;s debut album, &quot;White Flags&quot;. It is a mournful lament from King David&#x27;s perspective.
* &quot;Absalom&quot; is an album by the experimental/progressive band Stick Men featuring Tony Levin, Markus Reuter and Pat Mastelotto.
* The American Rock band Little Feat reference Absalom in their song &quot;Gimme a Stone&quot; on the album entitled &quot;Chinese Work Songs&quot;. This song is written from the perspective of King David—mainly focusing on the task of fighting Goliath—but contains a lament to Absalom. This was a cover of the song, the original being on the 1998 Americana concept album Largo, by David Forman and Levon Helm.

<text>Abydos ( or ; Sahidic &#x27;) is one of the oldest cities of [[ancient Egypt]], and also of the [[Ta-wer|eighth]] [[Nome (Egypt)|nome]] in [[Upper Egypt]]. It is located about west of the [[Nile]] at latitude 26° 10&#x27; N, near the modern Egyptian towns of [[El Araba El Madfuna]] and [[El Balyana]]. In the ancient [[Egyptian language]], the city was calledAbedju&quot;&#x27; (&quot;ꜣbḏw&quot; or &quot;AbDw&quot;)(Arabic Abdu عبد-و).
The English name &quot;Abydos&quot; comes from the Greek , a name borrowed by Greek geographers from the unrelated city of Abydos on the Hellespont. Abydos name in hieroglyphs 

Considered one of the most important archaeological sites in Egypt, the sacred city of Abydos was the site of many ancient temples, including Umm el-Qa&#x27;ab, a royal necropolis where early pharaohs were entombed. These tombs began to be seen as extremely significant burials and in later times it became desirable to be buried in the area, leading to the growth of the town&#x27;s importance as a cult site.

Today, Abydos is notable for the memorial temple of Seti I, which contains an inscription from the Nineteenth Dynasty known to the modern world as the Abydos King List. This is a chronological list showing cartouches of most dynastic pharaohs of Egypt from Menes until Seti I&#x27;s father, Ramesses I. It is also notable for the Abydos graffiti, ancient Phoenician and Aramaic graffiti found on the walls of the Temple of Seti I.

The Great Temple and most of the ancient town are buried under the modern buildings to the north of the Seti temple. Many of the original structures and the artifacts within them are considered irretrievable and lost; many may have been destroyed by the new construction.

== History ==

Most of Upper Egypt became unified under rulers from Abydos during the Naqada III period (3200–3000 BCE), at the expense of rival cities such as Nekhen. The conflicts leading to the supremacy of Abydos may appear on numerous reliefs of the Naqada II period, such as the Gebel el-Arak Knife, or the frieze of Tomb 100 at Hierakonpolis.

Tombs and at least one temple of rulers of the Predynastic period have been found at Umm El Qa&#x27;ab including that of Narmer, dating to . The temple and town continued to be rebuilt at intervals down to the times of the Thirtieth Dynasty, and the cemetery was in continuous use.

The pharaohs of the First Dynasty were buried in Abydos, including Narmer, who is regarded as the founder of the First Dynasty, and his successor, Aha. It was in this time period that the Abydos boats were constructed. Some pharaohs of the Second Dynasty were also buried in Abydos. The temple was renewed and enlarged by these pharaohs as well. Funerary enclosures, misinterpreted in modern times as great &#x27;forts&#x27;, were built on the desert behind the town by three kings of the Second Dynasty; the most complete is that of Khasekhemwy, the Shunet El Zebib.

From the Fifth Dynasty, the deity Khentiamentiu, &quot;foremost of the Westerners&quot;, came to be seen as a manifestation of the dead pharaoh in the underworld. Pepi I (Sixth Dynasty) constructed a funerary chapel which evolved over the years into the Great Temple of Osiris, the ruins of which still exist within the town enclosure. Abydos became the centre of the worship of the Isis and Osiris cult.

During the First Intermediate Period, the principal deity of the area, Khentiamentiu, began to be seen as an aspect of Osiris, and the deities gradually merged and came to be regarded as one. Khentiamentiu&#x27;s name became an epithet of Osiris. King Mentuhotep II was the first to build a royal chapel. In the Twelfth Dynasty a gigantic tomb was cut into the rock by Senusret III. Associated with this tomb was a cenotaph, a cult temple and a small town known as &quot;Wah-Sut&quot;, that was used by the workers for these structures. Next to the cenotaph at least two kings of the Thirteenth Dynasty were buried (in tombs S9 and S10) as well as some rulers of the Second Intermediate Period, such as Senebkay. An indigenous line of kings, the Abydos Dynasty, may have ruled the region from Abydos at the time.

New construction during the Eighteenth Dynasty began with a large chapel of Ahmose I. The Pyramid of Ahmose I was also constructed at Abydos—the only pyramid in the area; very little of it remains today.

Thutmose III built a far larger temple, about . He also made a processional way leading past the side of the temple to the cemetery beyond, featuring a great gateway of granite.

Seti I, during the Nineteenth Dynasty, founded a temple to the south of the town in honor of the ancestral pharaohs of the early dynasties; this was finished by Ramesses II, who also built a lesser temple of his own. Merneptah added the Osireion, just to the north of the temple of Seti.

Ahmose II in the Twenty-sixth Dynasty rebuilt the temple again, and placed in it a large monolith shrine of red granite, finely wrought. The foundations of the successive temples were comprised within approximately . depth of the ruins discovered in modern times; these needed the closest examination to discriminate the various buildings, and were recorded by more than 4,000 measurements and 1,000 levellings.

The last building added was a new temple of Nectanebo I, built in the Thirtieth Dynasty. From the Ptolemaic times of the Greek occupancy of Egypt, that began three hundred years before the Roman occupancy that followed, the structures began to decay and no later works are known.

=== Cult centre ===
From earliest times, Abydos was a cult centre, first of the local deity, Khentiamentiu, and from the end of the Old Kingdom, the rising cult of Osiris. A tradition developed that the Early Dynastic cemetery was the burial place of Osiris and the tomb of Djer was reinterpreted as that of Osiris.

Decorations in tombs throughout Egypt, such as the one displayed to the right, record pilgrimages to Abydos by wealthy families.

=== Great Osiris Temple ===

From the First Dynasty to the Twenty-sixth Dynasty, nine or ten temples were successively built on one site at Abydos. The first was an enclosure, about , enclosed by a thin wall of unbaked bricks. Incorporating one wall of this first structure, the second temple of about square was built with walls about thick. An outer &quot;temenos&quot; (enclosure) wall surrounded the grounds. This outer wall was made wider some time around the Second or Third Dynasty. The old temple entirely vanished in the Fourth Dynasty, and a smaller building was erected behind it, enclosing a wide hearth of black ashes. Pottery models of offerings are found in these ashes and were probably the substitutes for live sacrifices decreed by Khufu (or Cheops) in his temple reforms.

At an undetermined date, a great clearance of temple offerings had been made and the modern discovery of a chamber into which they were gathered yielded the fine ivory carvings and the glazed figures and tiles that demonstrate the splendid work of the First Dynasty. A vase of Menes with purple hieroglyphs inlaid into a green glaze and tiles with relief figures are the most important pieces found. The Khufu Statuette in ivory, found in the stone chamber of the temple, gives the only portrait of this great pharaoh.

The temple was entirely rebuilt on a larger scale by Pepi I in the Sixth Dynasty. He placed a great stone gateway to the &quot;temenos&quot;, an outer wall and gateway, with a colonnade between the gates. His temple was about inside, with stone gateways front and back, showing that it was of the processional type. In the Eleventh Dynasty Mentuhotep II added a colonnade and altars. Soon after, Mentuhotep III entirely rebuilt the temple, laying a stone pavement over the area, about square. He also added subsidiary chambers. Soon thereafter, in the Twelfth Dynasty, Senusret I laid massive foundations of stone over the pavement of his predecessor. A great &quot;temenos&quot; was laid out enclosing a much larger area and the new temple itself was about three times the earlier size.

=== Brewery ===
On 14 February 2021, Egyptian and American archaeologists discovered what could be the oldest brewery in the world dating from around 3100 BCE at the reign of King Narmer. Dr. Matthew Adams, one of the leaders of the mission, stated that it was used to make beer for royal rituals.

== Main sites ==
=== Seti I Temple ===

The temple of Seti I was built on entirely new ground half a mile to the south of the long series of temples just described. This surviving building is best known as the Great Temple of Abydos, being nearly complete and an impressive sight. A principal purpose of the temple was to serve as a memorial to king Seti I, as well as to show reverence for the early pharaohs, which is incorporated within as part of the &quot;Rite of the Ancestors&quot;.

The long list of the pharaohs of the principal dynasties—recognized by Seti—are carved on a wall and known as the &quot;Abydos King List&quot; (showing the cartouche name of many dynastic pharaohs of Egypt from the first, Narmer or Menes, until Seti&#x27;s time). There were significant names deliberately left off of the list. So rare, as an almost complete list of pharaoh names, the Table of Abydos, rediscovered by William John Bankes, has been called the &quot;Rosetta Stone&quot; of Egyptian archaeology, analogous to the Rosetta Stone for Egyptian writing, beyond the Narmer Palette.

There were also seven chapels built for the worship of the pharaoh and principal deities. These included three chapels for the &quot;state&quot; deities Ptah, Re-Horakhty, and (centrally positioned) Amun and the challenge for the Abydos triad of Osiris, Isis and Horus. The rites recorded in the deity chapels represent the first complete form known of the Daily Ritual, which was performed daily in temples across Egypt throughout the pharaonic period. At the back of the temple is an enigmatic structure known as the Osireion, which served as a cenotaph for Seti-Osiris, and is thought to be connected with the worship of Osiris as an &quot;Osiris tomb&quot;. It is possible that from those chambers was led out the great Hypogeum for the celebration of the Osiris mysteries, built by Merenptah. The temple was originally long, but the forecourts are scarcely recognizable, and the part still in good condition is about
 long and wide, including the wing at the side. Magazines for food and offerings storage were built to either side of the forecourts, as well as a small palace for the king and his retinue, to the southeast of the first forecourt (Ghazouli, The Palace and Magazines Attached to the Temple of Sety I at Abydos and the Facade of This Temple. ASAE 58 (1959)).

Except for the list of pharaohs and a panegyric on Ramesses II, the subjects are not historical, but religious in nature, dedicated to the transformation of the king after his death. The temple reliefs are celebrated for their delicacy and artistic refinement, utilizing both the archaism of earlier dynasties with the vibrancy of late 18th Dynasty reliefs. The sculptures had been published mostly in hand copy, not facsimile, by Auguste Mariette in his &quot;Abydos&quot;, I. The temple has been partially recorded epigraphically by Amice Calverley and Myrtle Broome in their 4 volume publication of &quot;The Temple of King Sethos I at Abydos&quot; (1933–1958).

==== King&#x27;s List ====
In The Gallery of Ancestors, also referred to as The Gallery of the List, one can find the Abydos King List. This list is depicted in low relief, carved under the reign of Seti I, and it shows Seti and Ramesses making offerings to their royal ancestors. These royal ancestors are the past kings of Egypt. Notably, some rulers, like the 15th Dynasty Hyksos that ruled Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period 1650-1550 BCE and the reign of the 18th Dynasty heretic Akhenaten of the New Kingdom 1550-1069, were omitted from the list, possibly due to being associated with periods of internal weakness and divisions. The Gallery of Ancestors led into the storerooms and the desert behind the temple.  

==== Osireion ====

The Osirion or Osireon, meaning &quot;Menmaatre beneficial to Osiris&quot; sometimes called the Osiris Complex, is an ancient Egyptian temple. It is located to the rear of the temple of Seti I. It is an integral part of Seti I&#x27;s funeral complex and is built to resemble an 18th Dynasty Valley of the Kings tomb. This was possibly used in ritual purposes with the growing of barely that allowed for the symbolic representation of the resurrection of Osiris. Today parts of the Osierion contain water due to the Aswan Dam and rising floodwaters.
==== Helicopter hieroglyphs ====

Some of the hieroglyphs carved over an arch on the site have been interpreted in esoteric and &quot;ufological&quot; circles as depicting modern technology, having been the subject of pyramidology. 

The &quot;helicopter&quot; image is the result of carved stone being re-used over time. The initial carving was made during the reign of Seti I and translates to &quot;He who repulses the nine [enemies of Egypt]&quot;. This carving was later filled in with plaster and re-carved during the reign of Ramesses II with the title &quot;He who protects Egypt and overthrows the foreign countries&quot;. Over time, the plaster has eroded away, leaving both inscriptions partially visible and creating a palimpsest-like effect of overlapping hieroglyphs. 
=== Ramesses II temple ===
The adjacent temple of Ramesses II was much smaller and simpler in plan, but it had a fine historical series of scenes around the outside that lauded his achievements, of which the lower parts remain. The outside of the temple was decorated with scenes of the Battle of Kadesh. His list of pharaohs, similar to that of Seti I, formerly stood here; the fragments were removed by the French consul and sold to the British Museum.

==== King&#x27;s List ====
Inside the temple once stood another Gallery of Ancestors. This list is also depicted in low relief, carved under the reign of Ramesses II, but is more damaged. The surviving fragments were removed by the French consul in 1837 and sold to the British Museum.

=== Umm El Qa&#x27;ab ===


The royal necropolises of the earliest dynasties were placed about a mile into the great desert plain, in a place now known as Umm El Qa&#x27;ab &quot;The Mother of Pots&quot; because of the shards remaining from all of the devotional objects left by religious pilgrims.

The earliest burial is about inside, a pit lined with brick walls and originally roofed with timber and matting. Other tombs also built before Menes are . The probable tomb of Menes is of the latter size. Afterwards, the tombs increased in size and complexity. The tomb-pit was surrounded by chambers to hold offerings, the sepulchre being a great wooden chamber in the midst of the brick-lined pit. Rows of small pits, tombs for the servants of the pharaoh, surrounded the royal chamber, many dozens of such burials being usual. Some of the offerings included sacrificed animals, such as the asses found in the tomb of Merneith. Evidence of human sacrifice exists in the early tombs, such as the 118 servants in the tomb of Merneith, but this practice was changed later into symbolic offerings.

By the end of the Second Dynasty the type of tomb constructed changed to a long passage with chambers on either side, the royal burial being in the middle of the length. The greatest of these tombs with its dependencies, covered a space of over , however it is possible for this to have been several tombs which abutted one another during construction; the Egyptians had no means of mapping the positioning of the tombs. The contents of the tombs have been nearly destroyed by successive plunderers; but enough remained to show that rich jewellery was placed on the mummies, a profusion of vases of hard and valuable stones from the royal table service stood about the body, the store-rooms were filled with great jars of wine, perfumed ointments, and other supplies, and tablets of ivory and of ebony were engraved with a record of the yearly annals of the reigns. The seals of various officials, of which over 200 varieties have been found, give an insight into the public arrangements.

A cemetery for private persons was put into use during the First Dynasty, with some pit-tombs in the town. It was extensive in the Twelfth and Thirteenth Dynasties and contained many rich tombs. A large number of fine tombs were made in the Eighteenth to Twentieth Dynasties, and members of later dynasties continued to bury their dead here until the Roman period. Many hundreds of funeral steles were removed by Auguste Mariette&#x27;s workmen, without any details of the burials being noted. Later excavations have been recorded by Edward R. Ayrton, Abydos, iii.; MacIver, &quot;El Amrah and Abydos&quot;; and Garstang, &quot;El Arabah&quot;.

=== &quot;Forts&quot; ===
Some of the tomb structures, referred to as &quot;forts&quot; by modern researchers, lay behind the town. Known as Shunet ez Zebib, it is about over all, and one still stands high. It was built by Khasekhemwy, the last pharaoh of the Second Dynasty. Another structure nearly as large adjoined it, and probably is older than that of Khasekhemwy. A third &quot;fort&quot; of a squarer form is now occupied by a convent of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria; its age cannot be ascertained.

=== Kom El Sultan ===

The area now known as Kom El Sultan is a big mudbrick structure, the purpose of which is not clear and thought to have been at the original settlement area, dated to the Early Dynastic Period. The structure includes the early temple of Osiris.

<text>Abydos (, ) was an ancient city and bishopric in Mysia. It was located at the Nara Burnu promontory on the Asian coast of the Hellespont (the straits of Dardanelles), opposite the ancient city of Sestos, and near the city of Çanakkale in Turkey. Abydos was founded in at the most narrow point in the straits, and thus was one of the main crossing points between Europe and Asia, until its replacement by the crossing between Lampsacus and Kallipolis in the 13th century, and the abandonment of Abydos in the early 14th century.

In Greek mythology, Abydos is presented in the myth of Hero and Leander as the home of Leander. The city is also mentioned in &quot;Rodanthe and Dosikles&quot;, a novel written by Theodore Prodromos, a 12th-century writer, in which Dosikles kidnaps Rodanthe at Abydos.

==Archaeology==
In 1675, the site of Abydos was first identified, and was subsequently visited by numerous classicists and travellers, such as Robert Wood, Richard Chandler, and Lord Byron. The city&#x27;s acropolis is known in Turkish as Mal Tepe.

Following the city&#x27;s abandonment, the ruins of Abydos were scavenged for building materials from the 14th to the 19th century, and remains of walls and buildings continued to be reported until at least the 19th century, however, little remains and the area was declared a restricted military zone in the early 20th century, thus little to no excavation has taken place.

==History==

===Classical period===

Abydos is mentioned in the &quot;Iliad&quot; as a Trojan ally, and, according to Strabo, was occupied by Bebryces and later Thracians after the Trojan War. It has been suggested that the city was originally a Phoenician colony as there was a temple of Aphrodite Porne (Aphrodite the Harlot) within Abydos. Abydos was settled by Milesian colonists contemporaneously with the foundation of the cities of Priapos and Prokonnesos in . Strabo related that Gyges, King of Lydia, granted his consent to the Milesians to settle Abydos; it is argued that this was carried out by Milesian mercenaries to act as a garrison to prevent Thracian raids into Asia Minor. The city became a thriving centre for tuna exportation as a result of the high yield of tuna in the Hellespont.

Abydos was ruled by Daphnis, a pro-Persian tyrant, in the 520s BC, but was occupied by the Persian Empire in 514. Darius I destroyed the city following his Scythian campaign in 512. Abydos participated in the Ionian Revolt in the early 5th century BC, however, the city returned briefly to Persian control as, in 480, at the onset of the Second Persian invasion of Greece, Xerxes I and the Persian army passed through Abydos on their march to Greece crossing the Hellespont on Xerxes&#x27; Pontoon Bridges. After the failed Persian invasion, Abydos became a member of the Athenian-led Delian League, and was part of the Hellespontine district. Ostensibly an ally, Abydos was hostile to Athens throughout this time, and contributed a &quot;phoros&quot; of 4-6 talents. Xenophon documented that Abydos possessed gold mines at Astyra or Kremaste at the time of his writing.
During the Second Peloponnesian War, a Spartan expedition led by Dercylidas arrived at Abydos in early May 411 BC and successfully convinced the city to defect from the Delian League and fight against Athens, at which time he was made harmost (commander/governor) of Abydos. A Spartan fleet was defeated by Athens at Abydos in the autumn of 411 BC. Abydos was attacked by the Athenians in the winter of 409/408 BC, but was repelled by a Persian force led by Pharnabazus, satrap (governor) of Hellespontine Phrygia. Dercylidas held the office of harmost of Abydos until at least . According to Aristotle, Abydos had an oligarchic constitution at this time. At the beginning of the Corinthian War in 394 BC, Agesilaus II, King of Sparta, passed through Abydos into Thrace. Abydos remained an ally of Sparta throughout the war and Dercylidas served as harmost of the city from 394 until he was replaced by Anaxibius in ; the latter was killed in an ambush near Abydos by the Athenian general Iphicrates in . At the conclusion of the Corinthian War, under the terms of the Peace of Antalcidas in 387 BC, Abydos was annexed to the Persian Empire. Within the Persian Empire, Abydos was administered as part of the satrapy of Hellespontine Phrygia, and was ruled by the tyrant Philiscus in 368. In , the city came under the control of the tyrant Iphiades.

===Hellenistic period===
Abydos remained under Persian control until it was seized by a Macedonian army led by Parmenion, a general of Philip II, in the spring of 336 BC. In 335, whilst Parmenion besieged the city of Pitane, Abydos was besieged by a Persian army led by Memnon of Rhodes, forcing Parmenion to abandon his siege of Pitane and march north to relieve Abydos. Alexander ferried across from Sestos to Abydos in 334 and travelled south to the city of Troy, after which he returned to Abydos. The following day, Alexander left Abydos and led his army north to Percote. Alexander later established a royal mint at Abydos, as well as at other cities in Asia Minor.

After the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, Abydos, as part of the satrapy of Hellespontine Phrygia, came under the control of Leonnatus as a result of the Partition of Babylon. At the Partition of Triparadisus in 321 BC, Arrhidaeus succeeded Leonnatus as satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia.

In 302, during the Fourth War of the Diadochi, Lysimachus, King of Thrace, crossed over into Asia Minor and invaded the kingdom of Antigonus I. Unlike the neighbouring cities of Parium and Lampsacus which surrendered, Abydos resisted Lysimachus and was besieged. Lysimachus was forced to abandon the siege, however, after the arrival of a relief force sent by Demetrius, son of King Antigonus I. According to Polybius, by the third century BC, the neighbouring city of Arisbe had become subordinate to Abydos. The city of Dardanus also came under the control of Abydos at some point in the Hellenistic period. Abydos became part of the Seleucid Empire after 281 BC. The city was conquered by Ptolemy III Euergetes, King of Egypt, in 245 BC, and remained under Ptolemaic control until at least 241, as Abydos had become part of the Kingdom of Pergamon by c. 200 BC.
During the Second Macedonian War, Abydos was besieged by Philip V, King of Macedonia, in 200 BC, during which many of its citizens chose to commit suicide rather than surrender. Marcus Aemilius Lepidus met with Philip V during the siege to deliver an ultimatum on behalf of the Roman senate. Ultimately, the city was forced to surrender to Philip V due to a lack of reinforcements. The Macedonian occupation ended after the Peace of Flamininus at the end of the war in 196 BC. At this time, Abydos was substantially depopulated and partially ruined as a result of the Macedonian occupation.

In the spring of 196 BC, Abydos was seized by Antiochus III, &quot;Megas Basileus&quot; of the Seleucid Empire, who refortified the city in 192/191 BC. Antiochus III later withdrew from Abydos during the Roman-Seleucid War, thus allowing for the transportation of the Roman army into Asia Minor by October 190 BC. Dardanus was subsequently liberated from Abydene control, and the Treaty of Apamea of 188 BC returned Abydos to the Kingdom of Pergamon. A gymnasium was active at Abydos in the 2nd century BC.

===Roman period===
Attalus III, King of Pergamon, bequeathed his kingdom to Rome upon his death in 133 BC, and thus Abydos became part of the province of Asia. The gold mines of Abydos at Astyra or Kremaste were near exhaustion at the time was Strabo was writing. The city was counted amongst the &quot;telonia&quot; (custom houses) of the province of Asia in the &quot;lex portorii Asiae&quot; of 62 AD, and formed part of the &quot;conventus iuridicus Adramytteum&quot;. Abydos is mentioned in the &quot;Tabula Peutingeriana&quot; and Antonine Itinerary. The mint of Abydos ceased to function in the mid-3rd century AD.

It is believed that Abydos, with Sestos and Lampsacus, is referred to as one of the &quot;three large capital cities&quot; of the Roman Empire in &quot;Weilüe&quot;, a 3rd-century AD Chinese text. The city was the centre for customs collection at the southern entrance of the Sea of Marmara, and was administered by a &quot;komes ton Stenon&quot; (count of the Straits) or an &quot;archon&quot; from the 3rd century to the 5th century AD.

===Medieval period===

Pope Martin I rested at Abydos in the summer of 653 whilst en route to Constantinople. As a result of the administrative reforms of the 7th century, Abydos came to be administered as part of the theme of Opsikion. The office of &quot;kommerkiarios&quot; of Abydos is first attested in the mid-7th century, and was later sometimes combined with the office of &quot;paraphylax&quot;, the military governor of the fort, introduced in the 8th century, at which time the office of &quot;komes ton stenon&quot; is last mentioned.

After the 7th century AD, Abydos became a major seaport. Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik, during his campaign against Constantinople, crossed over into Thrace at Abydos in July 717. The office of &quot;archon&quot; at Abydos was restored in the late 8th century and endured until the early 9th century. In 801, Empress Irene reduced commercial tariffs collected at Abydos. Emperor Nikephoros I, Irene&#x27;s successor, introduced a tax on slaves purchased beyond the city. The city later also became part of the theme of the Aegean Sea and was the seat of a &quot;tourmarches&quot;.

Abydos was sacked by an Arab fleet led by Leo of Tripoli in 904 AD whilst en route to Constantinople. The revolt of Bardas Phokas was defeated by Emperor Basil II at Abydos in 989 AD. In 992, the Venetians were granted reduced commercial tariffs at Abydos as a special privilege. In the early 11th century, Abydos became the seat of a separate command and the office of &quot;strategos&quot; (governor) of Abydos is first mentioned in 1004 with authority over the northern shore of the Hellespont and the islands of the Sea of Marmara.

In 1024, a Rus&#x27; raid led by a certain Chrysocheir defeated the local commander at Abydos and proceeded to travel south through the Hellespont. Following the Battle of Manzikert, Abydos was seized by the Seljuk Turks, but was recovered in 1086 AD, in which year Leo Kephalas was appointed &quot;katepano&quot; of Abydos. Abydos&#x27; population likely increased at this time as a result of the arrival of refugees from northwestern Anatolia who had fled the advance of the Turks. In 1092/1093, the city was attacked by Tzachas, a Turkish pirate. Emperor Manuel I Komnenos repaired Abydos&#x27; fortifications in the late 12th century.

By the 13th century AD, the crossing from Lampsacus to Kallipolis had become more common and largely replaced the crossing from Abydos to Sestos. During the Fourth Crusade, in 1204, the Venetians seized Abydos, and, following the Sack of Constantinople and the formation of the Latin Empire later that year, Emperor Baldwin granted the land between Abydos and Adramyttium to his brother Henry of Flanders. Henry of Flanders passed through Abydos on 11 November 1204 and continued his march to Adramyttium. Abydos was seized by the Empire of Nicaea, a successor state of the Eastern Roman Empire, during its offensive in 1206–1207, but was reconquered by the Latin Empire in 1212–1213. The city was later recovered by Emperor John III Vatatzes. Abydos declined in the 13th century, and was eventually abandoned between 1304 and 1310/1318 due to the threat of Turkish tribes and disintegration of Roman control over the region.

==Ecclesiastical history==

The bishopric of Abydus appears in all the &quot;Notitiae Episcopatuum&quot; of the Patriarchate of Constantinople from the mid-7th century until the time of Andronikos III Palaiologos (1341), first as a suffragan of Cyzicus and then from 1084 as a metropolitan see without suffragans. The earliest bishop mentioned in extant documents is Marcian, who signed the joint letter of the bishops of Hellespontus to Emperor Leo I in 458, protesting about the murder of Proterius of Alexandria. A letter of Peter the Fuller (471–488) mentions a bishop of Abydus called Pamphilus. Ammonius signed the decretal letter of the Council of Constantinople in 518 against Severus of Antioch and others. Isidore was at the Third Council of Constantinople (680–681), John at the Trullan Council (692), Theodore at the Second Council of Nicaea (787). An unnamed bishop of Abydus was a counsellor of Emperor Nikephoros II in 969.

Seals attest Theodosius as bishop of Abydos in the 11th century, and John as metropolitan bishop of Abydos in the 11/12th century. Abydos remained a metropolitan see until the city fell to the Turks in the 14th century. The diocese is currently a titular see of the Patriarchate of Constantinople, and Gerasimos Papadopoulos was titular Bishop of Abydos from 1962 until his death in 1995. Simeon Kruzhkov was bishop of Abydos from May to September 1998. Kyrillos Katerelos was consecrated bishop of Abydos in 2008.

In 1222, during the Latin occupation, the papal legate Giovanni Colonna united the dioceses of Abydos and Madytos and placed the see under direct Papal authority. No longer a residential bishopric, Abydus is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.
