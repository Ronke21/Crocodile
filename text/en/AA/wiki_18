<text>Abensberg () is a town in the Lower Bavarian district of Kelheim, in Bavaria, Germany, lying around southwest of Regensburg, east of Ingolstadt, northwest of Landshut and north of Munich. It is situated on the river Abens, a tributary of the Danube.

==Geography==
The town lies on the Abens river, a tributary of the Danube, around eight kilometres from the river&#x27;s source. The area around Abensberg is characterized by the narrow valley of the Danube, where the Weltenburg Abbey stands, the valley of the Altmühl in the north, a left tributary of the Danube, and the famous Hallertau hops-planting region in the south. The town is divided into the municipalities of Abensberg, Arnhofen, Holzharlanden, Hörlbach, Offenstetten, Pullach and Sandharland.

===Divisions===
Since the administrative reforms in Bavaria in the 1970s, the town also encompasses the following &quot;Ortsteile&quot;:
* In the town: Abensberg (main settlement), Aunkofen (civil parish), Badhaus (village)
* To the east: Gaden (village), See (village), Offenstetten (civil parish)
* To the north east: Arnhofen (civil parish), Baiern (village), Pullach (civil parish), Kleedorf (village)
* To the north: Sandharlanden (civil parish), Holzharlanden (civil parish), Buchhof (small hamlet)
* To the west: Schwaighausen (village), Schillhof (hamlet), Gilla (small hamlet)
* To the south: Aumühle (small hamlet), Allersdorf (hamlet)
* To the south east: Lehen (small hamlet), Mitterhörlbach (hamlet), Upper Hörlbach (village), Lower Hörlbach (hamlet)

==History==
There had been settlement on this part of the Abens river since long before the High Middle Ages, dating back to Neolithic times. Of particular interest and national importance are the Neolithic flint mines at Arnhofen, where, around 7,000 years ago, Stone Age people made flint, which was fashioned into drills, blades and arrowheads, and was regarded as the steel of the Stone Age. Traces of over 20,000 individuals were found on this site. The modern history of Abensberg, which is often incorrectly compared with that of the third century Roman castra (military outpost) of Abusina, begins with Gebhard, who was the first to mention Abensberg as a town, in the middle of the 12th century. The earliest written reference to the town, under the name of &quot;Habensperch&quot;, came from this time, in around 1138. Gebhard was from the Babonen clan.

In 1256, the castrum of &quot;Abensprech&quot; was first mentioned, and on 12 June 1348, Margrave Ludwig of Brandenburg, and his brother, Duke Stephen of Bavaria, raised Abensberg to the status of a city, giving it the right to operate lower courts, enclose itself with a wall and hold markets. The wall was built by Count Ulrich III of Abensberg. Some of the thirty-two round towers and eight turrets are still preserved to this day.

In the Middle Ages, the people of Abensberg enjoyed a level of autonomy above their lord. They elected a city council, although only a small number of rich families were eligible for election.

In around 1390, the Carmelite Monastery of Our Lady of Abensberg was founded by Count John II and his wife, Agnes. Although Abensberg was an autonomous city, it remained dependent on the powerful Dukes of Bavaria. The last Lord of Abensberg, Niclas, Graf von Abensberg, supposedly named after his godfather, Nicholas of Kues, a Catholic cardinal, was murdered in 1485 by Christopher, a Duke of Bavaria-Munich. The year before, Niclas had unchivalrously taken Christopher captive as he bathed before a tournament in Munich. Although Christopher renounced his claim for revenge, he lay in wait for Niclas in Freising. When the latter arrived, he was killed by Seitz von Frauenberg. He is buried in the former convent of Abensberg.

Abensberg then lost its independence and became a part of the Duchy of Bavaria, and from then on was administered by a ducal official, the so-called caretaker. The castle of Abensberg was destroyed during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, although the city had bought a guarantee of protection from the Swedish general, Carl Gustaf Wrangel. During the War of the Spanish Succession emperor Leopold I, who had occupied Bavaria, granted the fief of Abensberg to count Ernst von Abensperg und Traun (1608–1668) from an Austrian noble family named Traun that now received the name of the former counts of Abensberg (who were believed to be distant relatives). After the occupation ended, he was however dispossessed.

Johannes Aventinus (1477–1534) is the city&#x27;s most famous son, the founder of the study of history in Bavaria. Aventinus, whose name was real name is Johann or Johannes Turmair (&quot;Aventinus&quot; being the Latin name of his birthplace) wrote the &quot;Annals of Bavaria&quot;, a valuable record of the early history of Germany and the first major written work on the subject. He is commemorated in the Walhalla temple, a monument near Regensburg to the distinguished figures of German history. Until 1800, Abensberg was a municipality belonging to the Straubing district of the Electorate of Bavaria. Abensberg also contained a magistrates&#x27; court. In the Battle of Abensberg on 19–20 April 1809, Napoleon gained a significant victory over the Austrians under Archduke Ludwig of Austria and General Johann von Hiller.

===Coat of arms===
The arms of the city are divided into two halves. On the left are the blue and white rhombuses of Bavaria, while the right half is split into two silver and black triangles. Two diagonally-crossed silver swords with golden handles rest on top.

The town has had a coat of arms since 1338, that of the Counts of Abensberg. With the death of the last Count, Nicholas of Abensberg, in 1485, the estates fell to the Duchy of Bavaria-Munich, meaning that henceforth only the Bavarian coat of arms was ever used.

On 31 December 1809, a decree of King Maximilian of Bavaria granted the city a new coat of arms, as a recognition of their (mainly humanitarian and logistic) services in the Battle of Abensberg the same year. The diagonally divided field in silver and black came from the old crest of the Counts of Abensberg, while the white and blue diamonds came from that of the House of Wittelsbach, the rulers of Bavaria. The swords recall the Battle of Abensberg.

The district of Offenstetten previously possessed its own coat of arms.

===Twinning===
* Parga, Greece since 1986
* Lonigo, Italy since 1999

==Economy and Infrastructure==
The area around Abensberg, the so-called sand belt between Siegburg, Neustadt an der Donau, Abensberg and Langquaid, is used for the intensive farming of asparagus, due to the optimal soil condition and climate. 212 hectares of land can produce ninety-four asparagus plants. Abensberg asparagus enjoys a reputation among connoisseurs as a particular delicacy. In addition to asparagus, the production of hops plays a major role locally, the region having its own label, and there are still three independent breweries in the area. The town of Abensberg marks the start of the &quot;Deutsche Hopfenstraße&quot; (&quot;German Hops Road&quot;), a nickname given to the Bundesstraße 301, a German federal highway which runs through the heartland of Germany&#x27;s hops-growing industry, ending in Freising.

===Transport===
The Abensberg railway station is located on the Regensburg–Ingolstadt railway from Regensburg to Ingolstadt. The city can be reached via the A-93 Holledau-Regensburg road (exit Abensberg). Three Bundesstraße (German federal highways) cross south of Abensberg: B 16, B 299 and B 301.

==Public facilities==

===Schools===

Abensberg has two Grundschulen (primary school) and Mittelschule (open admission secondary school), and the Johann-Turmair-Realschule (secondary modern school). There is also a College of Agriculture and Home Economics. Since 2007, the Kelheim Berufsschule has had a campus in Abensberg, and outside the state sector is the St. Francis Vocational Training Centre, run by a Catholic youth organisation. In addition, there are two special schools, one near Abensberg, the other in the civil parish of Offenstetten.

==Culture and sightseeing==
===Theatre===
In 2008, a former goods shed by the main railway station of Abensberg was converted into a theatre by local volunteers. The &quot;Theater am Bahnhof&quot; (&quot;Theatre at the Railway Station&quot;) is mostly used by the &quot;Theatergruppe Lampenfieber&quot; and was opened on 19 October 2008.

===Museums===
Abensberg has a long tradition of museums. In the nineteenth century, Nicholas Stark und Peter Paul Dollinger began a collection based on local history. This collection and the collection of the &quot;Heimatverein&quot; (local history society) were united in 1963 into the Aventinus Museum, in the cloister of the former Carmelite monastery. On 7 July 2006, the new Town Museum of Abensberg was opened in the former duke&#x27;s castle in the town.

===Kuchlbauer Brewery===
Two blocks west of the Old Town is the Kuchlbauer Brewery and beer garden featuring the Kuchlbauer Tower, a colorful and unconventional observation tower designed by Viennese architect Friedensreich Hundertwasser. The brewery and tower are open to the public.

===Missing memorial===
Up until the 1950s, Abensberg and the surrounding villages contained a number of graves of victims of a Death March in the spring of 1945 from the Hersbruck sub-camp of the Dachau concentration camp, who were either murdered by the SS or died of exhaustion. They were originally buried where they died, but were later moved on the orders of the US military government to the cemeteries of their previous homes. At the cemetery in what is now the district of Pullach stood a memorial stone which was mentioned as recently as 1967, but which is no longer at the site. The suffering of ten unknown victims of the camp was recorded on the stone.

===Regular events===
*The Abensberger events calendar begins in February with the &quot;Faschingsgillamoos&quot; funfair, which reaches its high point on Mad Thursday.
*There then follows the &quot;Frühjahrsmarkt&quot; (Spring market) two weeks before Easter, when all the shops in the town are permitted to open on Sunday (which is normally prohibited in Germany).
*The &quot;Bürgerfest&quot; is celebrated on the first weekend of July, when the palace gardens with their ancient walls are transformed into a medieval camp.
*The &quot;Schlossgartenfest&quot; (Palace Garden Festival) takes place every year at the beginning of August. It is organised since 1977 by the Junge Union, the youth branch of Germany&#x27;s two main conservative political parties, the CDU and CSU, and attracts all age groups from Abensberg and surrounding areas.
*On the second Saturday in August, people can wander through the Night Market in the balmy Summer evening.
*The &quot;Gillamoos&quot;, the oldest and largest funfair in the Hallertau opens on the Thursday before the first Sunday in September and runs until the Monday thereafter. It is the highlight of the year in Abensberg and is a celebration of the people of Abensberg and the surrounding area.
*The &quot;Herbstmarkt&quot; (autumn market), another Sunday shopping day, is on the first weekend in October.
*Since 1997, a series of cultural, art, music and entertainment events have taken place in November at various locations in the town, under the title, &quot;Novembernebel&quot; (November fog)
*On Saint Nicholas Day (6 December), the &quot;Niklasmarkt&quot; (Nicholas Market) commemorates the &quot;Niklasspende&quot;, a medieval foundation for the poor. This heralds the beginning of Advent and the Christmas period.

<doc id="1306" wikidata="Q13446873" url="?curid=1306" title="Arminianism">
<text>Arminianism is a movement of Protestantism initiated in the early 17th century, based on the theological ideas of the Dutch Reformed theologian Jacobus Arminius and his historic supporters known as Remonstrants. Dutch Arminianism was originally articulated in the &quot;Remonstrance&quot; (1610), a theological statement submitted to the States General of the Netherlands. This expressed an attempt to moderate the doctrines of Calvinism related to its interpretation of predestination.

Classical Arminianism, to which Arminius is the main contributor, and Wesleyan Arminianism, to which John Wesley is the main contributor, are the two main schools of thought. Central Arminian beliefs are that God&#x27;s prevenient grace, which prepares regeneration, is universal and that His grace, allowing regeneration and ongoing sanctification, is resistible.

Many Christian denominations have been influenced by Arminian views, notably the Baptists in the 17th century, the Methodists in the 18th century, and the Pentecostals in the 20th century.

==History==

===Precursor movements and theological influences===

Arminius&#x27; beliefs, i.e. Arminianism, did not begin with him. Before the Reformation, groups like the Waldensians similarly affirmed individual freedom over any predetermined predestination. Anabaptist theologian Balthasar Hubmaier (1480–1528) also promoted much the same view as Arminius nearly a century before him. The soteriological doctrines of Arminianism and Anabaptism are roughly equivalent. In particular, Mennonites have been historically Arminian whether they distinctly espoused the Arminian viewpoint or not, and rejected Calvinist soteriology. Anabaptist theology seems to have influenced Jacobus Arminius. At least, he was &quot;sympathetic to the Anabaptist point of view, and Anabaptists were commonly in attendance on his preaching.&quot; Similarly, Arminius mentions Danish Lutheran theologian Niels Hemmingsen (1513–1600) as holding the basic view of soteriology he held and he may have been influenced by Hemmingsen. Another key figure, Sebastian Castellio (1515–1563), who opposed Calvin&#x27;s views on predestination and religious intolerance, is known to have influenced both the Mennonites and certain theologians within Arminius’s circle. Early critics of Arminians even cited Castellio as a primary inspiration behind the Arminian movement.

===Emergence of Arminianism===
Jacobus Arminius (1560-1609) was a Dutch pastor and theologian. He was taught by Theodore Beza, Calvin&#x27;s hand-picked successor, but after examination of the scriptures, he rejected his teacher&#x27;s theology that it is God who unconditionally elects some for salvation. Instead Arminius proposed that the election of God was &quot;of believers&quot;, thereby making it conditional on faith. Arminius&#x27;s views were challenged by the Dutch Calvinists, especially Franciscus Gomarus.

In his &quot;Declaration of Sentiments&quot; (1608) Arminius presented his theology to magistrates of the States General of the Netherlands in The Hague. After his death, Arminius&#x27;s followers continued to advance his theological vision, crafting the &quot;Five articles of Remonstrance&quot; (1610), in which they express their points of divergence from the stricter Calvinism of the &quot;Belgic Confession&quot;. This is how Arminius&#x27;s followers were called Remonstrants, and following a &quot;Counter Remonstrance&quot; in 1611, Gomarus&#x27; followers were called Counter-Remonstrants.

After some political maneuvering, the Dutch Calvinists were able to convince Prince Maurice of Nassau to deal with the situation. Maurice systematically removed Arminian magistrates from office and called a national synod at Dordrecht. This Synod of Dort was open primarily to Dutch Calvinists (102 people), while the Arminians were excluded (13 people banned from voting), with Calvinist representatives from other countries (28 people), and in 1618 published a condemnation of Arminius and his followers as heretics. The Canons of Dort responded, among other topics, to Arminian doctrines, anticipating their later articulation as the Five points of Calvinism.

Arminians across Holland were removed from office, imprisoned, banished, and sworn to silence. Twelve years later, Holland officially granted Arminianism protection as a religion, although animosity between Arminians and Calvinists continued. Most of the early Remonstrants followed a classical version of Arminianism. However, some of them such as Philipp van Limborch, moved in the direction of semi-Pelagianism and rationalism.

===Arminianism in the Church of England===

In England, the so-labelled Arminian doctrines were held, in substance, before and in parallel with those of Arminius. The Thirty-nine Articles of Religion (finalised in 1571), were sufficiently ambiguous that they were compatible with either Arminian or Calvinistic interpretations. Arminianism in the Church of England was fundamentally an expression of negation of Calvinism, and only some theologians held to classical Arminianism, but for the rest they were either semi-Pelagian or Pelagian. In this specific context, contemporary historians prefer to use the term &quot;proto-Arminians&quot; rather than &quot;Arminians&quot; to designate the leanings of those divines who generally didn&#x27;t follow classical Arminianism. English Arminianism was represented by Arminian Puritans such as John Goodwin or High Anglican Arminians such as Jeremy Taylor and Henry Hammond. Anglican Arminians of the 17th century such as William Laud fought Calvinist Puritans. They actually saw Arminianism in terms of a state church, an idea that was alien to the views of Arminius. This position became particularly evident under the reign (1625–1649) of Charles I of England. Following the English Civil War (1642–1651) Charles II of England, who tolerated the Presbyterians, re-instituted Arminian thought in the Church of England. It was dominant there after the Restoration (1660) for some fifty years.
===Baptists===
The Baptist movement emerged in 17th-century in England. The first Baptists—called &quot;General Baptists&quot; because of their confession of a &quot;general&quot; or unlimited atonement—were Arminians. The Baptist movement originated with Thomas Helwys, who left his mentor John Smyth (who had moved into shared belief and other distinctives of the Dutch Waterlander Mennonites of Amsterdam) and returned to London to start the first English Baptist Church in 1611. Later General Baptists such as John Griffith, Samuel Loveday, and Thomas Grantham defended a Reformed Arminian theology that reflected the Arminianism of Arminius. The General Baptists encapsulated their Arminian views in numerous confessions, the most influential of which was the Standard Confession of 1660. In the 1640s the Particular Baptists were formed, diverging from Arminian doctrine and embracing the strong Calvinism of the Presbyterians and Independents. Their robust Calvinism was publicized in such confessions as the London Baptist Confession of 1644 and the Second London Confession of 1689. The London Confession of 1689 was later used by Calvinistic Baptists in America (called the Philadelphia Baptist Confession), whereas the Standard Confession of 1660 was used by the American heirs of the English General Baptists, who soon came to be known as Free Will Baptists.

===Methodists===

In the Methodist-Calvinist controversy of the early 1770s involving Anglican ministers John Wesley and George Whitefield, Wesley responded to accusations of semi-Pelagianism by embracing an Arminian identity. Wesley had limited familiarity with the beliefs of Arminius and largely formulated his views without direct reliance on Arminius&#x27; teachings. Wesley was notably influenced by 17th-century English Arminianism and by some Remonstrant spokesmen. However, he is recognized as a faithful representative of Arminius&#x27; beliefs. Wesley defended his soteriology through the publication of a periodical titled &quot;The Arminian&quot; (1778) and in articles such as &quot;Predestination Calmly Considered&quot;. To support his stance, he strongly maintained belief in total depravity while clarifying other doctrines notably prevenient grace. At the same time, Wesley attacked the determinism that he claimed characterized Calvinist doctrines of predestination. He typically preached the notion of Christian perfection (fully mature, not &quot;sinlessness&quot;). His system of thought has become known as Wesleyan Arminianism, the foundations of which were laid by him and his fellow preacher John William Fletcher. Methodism also navigated its own theological intricacies concerning salvation and human agency. In the 1830s, during the Second Great Awakening, traces of Pelagian influence surfaced in the American Holiness Movement. Consequently, critics of Wesleyan theology have occasionally unfairly perceived or labeled its broader thought. However, its core is recognized to be Arminianism.

===Pentecostals===
Pentecostalism has its background in the activity of Charles Parham (1873–1929). Its origin as a movement was in the Azusa Street Revival in Los Angeles in 1906. This revival was led by William J. Seymour (1870–1922). Due to the Methodist and Holiness background of many early Pentecostal preachers, the Pentecostal churches usually possessed practices that arose from the Wesleyan Arminianism. During the 20th century, as Pentecostal churches began to settle and incorporate more standard forms, they started to formulate theology that was fully Arminian. Today, Pentecostal denominations such as the Assemblies of God hold to Arminian views such as resistible grace, conditional election, and conditional security of the believer.

==Current landscape==
===Protestant denominations===
Advocates of Arminianism find a home in many Protestant denominations, and sometimes other beliefs such as Calvinism exist within the same denomination. The Lutheran theological tradition bears certain similarities to Arminianism and there may be some Lutheran churches that are open to it. Newer Evangelical Anglican denominations also show a level of openness to Arminian theology. Anabaptist denominations, such as the Mennonites, Hutterites, Amish and Schwarzenau Brethren, adhere to Anabaptist theology, which espouses a soteriology that is similar to Arminianism &quot;in some respects&quot;. Arminianism is found within the General Baptists, including the subset of General Baptists known as Free Will Baptists. The majority of Southern Baptists embrace a traditionalist form of Arminianism which includes a belief in eternal security, though many see Calvinism as growing in acceptance. Certain proponents of Arminianism may be found within the Restoration movement in the Christian Churches and Churches of Christ. Additionally, it is found in the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Arminianism (specifically Wesleyan–Arminian theology) is taught in the Methodist churches, inclusive of those denominations aligned with the holiness movement such as the Evangelical Methodist Church, Church of the Nazarene, the Free Methodist Church, the Wesleyan Church, and the Salvation Army. It is also found in a part of the Charismatics, including the Pentecostals.

===Scholarly support===
Arminian theology has found support among theologians, Bible scholars, and apologists spanning various historical periods and theological circles. Noteworthy historical figures include Jacobus Arminius, Simon Episcopius, Hugo Grotius, John Goodwin, Thomas Grantham, John Wesley, Richard Watson, Thomas Osmond Summers, John Miley, William Burt Pope and Henry Orton Wiley.

In contemporary Baptist traditions, advocates of Arminian theology include Roger E. Olson, F. Leroy Forlines, Robert Picirilli and J. Matthew Pinson. Within the Methodist tradition, prominent supporters encompass Thomas Oden, Ben Witherington III, David Pawson, B. J. Oropeza, Thomas H. McCall and Fred Sanders. The Holiness movement boasts theologians like Carl O. Bangs and J. Kenneth Grider. Furthermore, scholars such as Keith D. Stanglin, Craig S. Keener and Grant R. Osborne also support Arminian perspectives.

==Theology==
===Theological legacy===
The Pelagian-Augustinian framework can serve as a key paradigm for understanding the theological and historical legacy of Arminianism. Before Augustine (354–430), the synergistic view of salvation was almost universally endorsed. Pelagius (c. 354–418), however, argued that humans could perfectly obey God by their own will. The Pelagian view is therefore referred to as &quot;humanistic monergism&quot;. This view was condemned at the Council of Carthage (418) and Ephesus (431). In response, Augustine proposed a view in which God is the ultimate cause of all human actions, a stance that aligns with soft determinism. The Augustinian view is therefore referred to as &quot;divine monergism&quot;. However, Augustinian soteriology implied double predestination, which was condemned by the Council of Arles (475).

During this period, a moderate form of Pelagianism emerged, later termed Semi-Pelagianism. This view asserted that human will initiates salvation, rather than divine grace. The Semi-Pelagian view is therefore described as &quot;human-initiated synergism&quot;. In 529, the Second Council of Orange addressed Semi-Pelagianism and declared that even the inception of faith is a result of God’s grace. This highlights the role of prevenient grace enabling human belief. This view, often referred to as &quot;Semi-Augustinian,&quot; is therefore described as &quot;God-initiated synergism&quot;. The Council also rejected predestination to evil. As Arminianism aligns with key aspects of this view, it is seen by some as a return to early church theological consensus. Moreover, Arminianism can also be seen as a soteriological diversification of Calvinism or more specifically, as a theological middle ground between Calvinism and semi-Pelagianism.

Arminian theology generally divides into two main variations: Classical Arminianism, based on the teachings of Jacobus Arminius, and Wesleyan Arminianism, a closely related variation shaped primarily by John Wesley.

===Classical Arminianism===
==== Definition and terminology ====

Classical Arminianism is a protestant theological view, that asserts God&#x27;s prevenient grace for regeneration is universal and that the grace allowing regeneration and ongoing sanctification is resistible. This theological system was presented by Jacobus Arminius and maintained by some of the Remonstrants, such as Simon Episcopius and Hugo Grotius. 

Arminian theology incorporates the language and framework of covenant theology. Its core teachings are summarized in the &quot;Five Articles of Remonstrance&quot;, reflecting Arminius’s views, with some sections directly from his &quot;Declaration of Sentiments&quot;. Some theologians have referred to this system as &quot;classical Arminianism&quot;. Others prefer &quot;Reformation Arminianism&quot; or &quot;Reformed Arminianism&quot;, as Arminius upheld the principles of Reformation such as &quot;Sola fide&quot; and &quot;Sola gratia&quot;.

====God&#x27;s providence and human free will====
Arminianism accepts classical theism, which states that God is omnipresent, omnipotent, and omniscient. In that view, God&#x27;s power, knowledge, and presence have no external limitations, that is, outside of his divine nature and character.

Besides, Arminianism view on God&#x27;s sovereignty is based on postulates stemming from God&#x27;s character. On the first hand, divine election must be defined in such a way that God is not in any case, and even in a secondary way, the author of evil. It would not correspond to the character of God, especially as fully revealed in Jesus Christ. On the other hand, man&#x27;s responsibility for evil must be preserved. Those two postulates require a specific way by which God chooses to manifest his sovereignty when interacting with his creatures.

On one hand, it requires for God to operate according to a limited mode of providence. This means that God deliberately exercises sovereignty without determining every event. On the other hand, it requires for God&#x27;s election to be a &quot;predestination by foreknowledge&quot;. Therefore, God&#x27;s foreknowledge is exhaustive and complete, aligning his certainty with human freedom of action.

==== Philosophical view on free will ====
Arminianism is aligned with classical free-will theism, adopting an incompatibilist position. It asserts that the free will essential for moral responsibility is inherently incompatible with determinism. In Arminian theology, human beings possess libertarian free will, making them the ultimate source of their choices and granting them the ability to choose otherwise. This philosophical framework upholds the concept of divine providence, allowing God&#x27;s influence and supervision over creation. However, it permits the idea of God&#x27;s absolute control over human actions, as long as such control does not involve human responsibility.

====Spiritual view on free will====
Arminianism holds that without the assistance of divine grace, human free will is incapable of choosing the spiritual good. Humans are therefore in a state of total depravity, possessing a corrupted spiritual nature. Arminius likely believed that every person is born in this depraved condition because Adam, as humanity’s representative, sinned against God—a view later shared by several prominent Arminians. Like Augustine, Luther, and Calvin, Arminius agreed that human free will is spiritually &quot;captive&quot; and &quot;enslaved&quot;. However, through the action of prevenient grace, human free will can be &quot;freed&quot;, meaning it can be restored with the ability to choose the spiritual good, particularly the capacity to accept God&#x27;s call to salvation.

====Extent and nature of the atonement====
Atonement is intended universally: Jesus&#x27;s death was for all people, Jesus draws all people to himself, with the opportunity for salvation through faith.

Jesus&#x27;s death satisfies God&#x27;s justice: The penalty for the sins of the elect is paid in full through the crucifixion of Christ. Thus Christ&#x27;s death atones for the sins of all, but requires faith to be effected. Arminius states that &quot;Justification, when used for the act of a Judge, is either purely the imputation of righteousness through mercy [...] or that man is justified before God [...] according to the rigor of justice without any forgiveness.&quot; Justification, therefore, is seen through mercy by the imputation of righteousness. While not rigidly defined, this view suggests that the righteousness of Christ is attributed to believers, emphasizing that union with Christ (conditioned on faith) transfers his righteousness to them.

Christ&#x27;s atonement has a substitutionary effect which is limited only to the elect. Arminius held that God&#x27;s justice was satisfied by penal substitution. Hugo Grotius taught that it was satisfied governmentally. Historical and contemporary Arminians have held to one of these views.

====Conversion of man====
In Arminianism, God initiates the process of salvation by extending his grace, commonly referred to as &quot;prevenient&quot; grace, to all people. This grace works within each individual, drawing them toward the Gospel and enabling sincere faith, leading to regeneration. It functions through a dynamic influence-and-response relationship, allowing individuals to freely accept or reject it. Thus, conversion is described as a &quot;God-initiated synergism.&quot;

====Election of man====
Election is conditional: Arminius defined &quot;election&quot; as &quot;the decree of God by which, of Himself, from eternity, He decreed to justify in Christ, believers, and to accept them unto eternal life.&quot; God alone determines who will be saved and his determination is that all who believe Jesus through faith will be justified. According to Arminius, &quot;God regards no one in Christ unless they are engrafted in him by faith.&quot;

God predestines the elect to a glorious future: Predestination is not the predetermination of who will believe, but rather the predetermination of the believer&#x27;s future inheritance. The elect are therefore predestined to sonship through adoption, glorification, and eternal life.

====Preservation of man====
Related to eschatological considerations, Jacobus Arminius and the first Remonstrants, including Simon Episcopius believed in everlasting fire where the wicked are thrown by God at judgment day.

Preservation is conditional: All believers have full assurance of salvation with the condition that they remain in Christ. Salvation is conditioned on faith, therefore perseverance is also conditioned. Arminius believed the Scriptures taught that believers are graciously empowered by Christ and the Holy Spirit &quot;to fight against Satan, sin, the world and their own flesh, and to gain the victory over these enemies.&quot; Furthermore, Christ and the Spirit are ever present to aid and assist believers through various temptations. But this security was not unconditional but conditional—&quot;provided they [believers] stand prepared for the battle, implore his help, and be not wanting to themselves, Christ preserves them from falling.&quot;

==== Possibility of apostasy ====

Arminius believed in the possibility of apostasy. However, over the period of time he wrote on this question, he sometimes expressed himself more cautiously out of consideration for the faith of his readers. In 1599, he stated that the question required more scriptural examination. In his &quot;Declaration of Sentiments&quot; (1607), Arminius said, &quot;I never taught that a true believer can, either totally or finally fall away from the faith, and perish; yet I will not conceal, that there are passages of scripture which seem to me to wear this aspect.&quot;

However, elsewhere Arminius expressed certainty about the possibility of falling away: In c. 1602, he noted that a person integrated into the church might resist God&#x27;s work and that a believer&#x27;s security rested solely in their choice not to abandon their faith. He argued that God&#x27;s covenant did not eliminate the possibility of falling away but provided a gift of fear to keep individuals from defecting, as long as it thrived in their hearts. He then taught that had David died in sin, he would have been lost. In 1602, Arminius also wrote: &quot;A believing member of Christ may become slothful, give place to sin, and gradually die altogether, ceasing to be a member&quot;.

For Arminius, a certain class of sin would cause a believer to fall, especially sin motivated by malice. In 1605 Arminius wrote: “But it is possible for a believer to fall into a mortal sin, as is seen in David. Therefore, he can fall at that moment in which if he were to die, he would be condemned&quot;. Scholars observe that Arminius clearly identifies two paths to apostasy 1. &quot;rejection&quot;, or 2. &quot;malicious sinning&quot;. He suggested that, strictly speaking, believers could not directly lose their faith but could cease to believe and thus fall away.

After the death of Arminius in 1609, his followers wrote a &quot;Remonstrance&quot; (1610) based quite literally on his &quot;Declaration of Sentiments&quot; (1607) which expressed prudence on the possibility of apostasy. In particular, its fifth article expressed the necessity of further study on the possibility of apostasy. Sometime between 1610 and the official proceeding of the Synod of Dort (1618), the Remonstrants became fully persuaded in their minds that the Scriptures taught that a true believer was capable of falling away from faith and perishing eternally as an unbeliever. They formalized their views in &quot;The Opinion of the Remonstrants&quot; (1618) which was their official stand during the Synod of Dort. They later expressed this same view in the &quot;Remonstrant Confession&quot; (1621).

====Forgivability of apostasy====
Arminius maintained that if the apostasy came from &quot;malicious&quot; sin, then it was forgivable. If it came from &quot;rejection&quot; it was not. Following Arminius, the Remonstrants believed that, though possible, apostasy was not in general irremediable. However, other classical Arminians, including the Free Will Baptists, have taught that apostasy is irremediable.

===Wesleyan Arminianism===

==== Distinctive aspect ====

John Wesley thoroughly agreed with the vast majority of what Arminius himself taught. Wesleyan Arminianism is a merger of classical Arminianism and Wesleyan perfectionism.

====Nature of the atonement====
Wesley’s view of atonement is either understood as a hybrid of penal substitution and the governmental theory, or it is viewed solely as penal substitution. Historically, Wesleyan Arminians adopted either the penal or governmental theory of atonement.

==== Justification and sanctification ====
In Wesleyan theology, justification is understood as the forgiveness of sins rather than being made inherently righteous. Righteousness is achieved through sanctification, which involves the pursuit of holiness in one&#x27;s life. Wesley taught that imputed righteousness, which refers to the righteousness credited to a believer through faith, must transform into imparted righteousness, where this righteousness becomes evident in the believer’s life. 

====Christian perfection====
Wesley taught that through the Holy Spirit, Christians can achieve a state of practical perfection, or &quot;entire sanctification&quot;, characterized by a lack of voluntary sin. This state involves embodying the love of God and neighbor. It does not mean freedom from all mistakes or temptations, as perfected Christians still need to seek forgiveness and strive for holiness. Ultimately, perfection in this context is about love, not absolute perfection.

====Preservation and apostasy of man====
Wesley believed that genuine Christians could apostatize. He emphasized that sin alone does not lead to this loss; instead, prolonged unconfessed sin and deliberate apostasy can result in a permanent fall from grace. However, he believed that such apostasy was not irremediable.

===Corporate election variation===

The majority Arminian view is that election is individual and based on God&#x27;s foreknowledge of faith. In the corporate election view, God chose the believing church collectively for salvation, rather than selecting individuals. Jesus is seen as the only person elected, and individuals join the elect through faith &quot;in Christ&quot;. This view is supported by Old Testament and Jewish concepts, where identity is rooted more in group membership than individuality.

==Arminianism and other views==
=== Divergence with Pelagianism ===
Pelagianism is a doctrine denying original sin and total depravity. No system of Arminianism founded on Arminius or Wesley denies original sin or total depravity; both Arminius and Wesley &quot;strongly&quot; affirmed that man&#x27;s basic condition is one in which he cannot be righteous, understand God, or seek God. Arminius referred to Pelagianism as &quot;the grand falsehood&quot; and stated that he &quot;must confess that I detest, from my heart, the consequences [of that theology].&quot; This association is considered as libelous when attributed to Arminius&#x27; or Wesley&#x27;s doctrine, and Arminians reject all accusations of Pelagianism.

===Divergence with Semi-Pelagianism===
Semi-Pelagianism holds that faith begins with human will, while its continuation and fulfillment depend on God&#x27;s grace, giving it the label &quot;human-initiated synergism&quot;. In contrast, both Classical and Wesleyan Arminianism affirm that prevenient grace from God initiates the process of salvation, a view sometimes referred to as &quot;Semi-Augustinian&quot;, or &quot;God-initiated synergism&quot;. Following the Reformation, Reformed theologians often categorized both &quot;human-initiated synergism&quot; and &quot;God-initiated synergism&quot; as &quot;Semi-Pelagianism&quot;, often leading to mistaken belief that Arminianism aligned with Semi-Pelagianism.

===Divergence with Calvinism===
Calvinism and Arminianism, while sharing historical roots and many theological doctrines, diverge notably on the concepts of divine predestination and election. While some perceive these differences as fundamental, others regard them as relatively minor distinctions within the broader spectrum of Christian theology.

====Similarities====
* Human spiritual condition – Arminians agree with Calvinists on the doctrine of total depravity, but differ in their understanding of how God remedies this human condition.

====Differences====
* Nature of election – Arminians believe election to final salvation is conditional on faith, while Calvinists hold that unconditional election is based on God&#x27;s predeterminism making Him the ultimate cause of everything, including human faith.
* Nature of grace – Arminians believe that, through prevenient grace, God universally restores the individual spiritual ability to choose and that subsequent justifying grace is resistible. Calvinists however, assert that God&#x27;s effectual call is given only to the elect and that subsequent grace is irresistible.
* Extent of the atonement – Arminians, along with four-point Calvinists, advocate for a universal atonement, contrary to the Calvinist doctrine that atonement is limited to the elect. Both sides, excluding hyper-Calvinists, believe the Gospel invitation is universal and should be presented to everyone without distinction. 
* Perseverance in faith – Arminians believe preservation to final salvation is conditional on faith and can be lost through apostasy. They contend for a present security in Christ, relying on His protection from all external forces. Calvinists, on the other hand, hold to the perseverance of the saints, asserting that the elect will persevere in faith until the end of their lives. However, a believer cannot know with certainty if they are elect until they reach the end. This leads to different interpretations on the assurance of final salvation within Calvinist circles.

===Divergence with open theism===
The doctrine of open theism states that God is omnipresent, omnipotent, and omniscient, but differs on the nature of the future. Open theists claim that the future is not completely determined (or &quot;settled&quot;) because people have not made their free decisions yet. God therefore knows the future partially in possibilities (human free actions) rather than solely certainties (divinely determined events). Some Arminians, reject open theism, viewing it as a distortion of traditional Arminianism. They believe it shifts away from classical Arminianism toward process theology. Others view it as a valid alternative perspective within Christianity, despite not aligning it with Arminian doctrine.

<doc id="1307" wikidata="Q533478" url="?curid=1307" title="The Alan Parsons Project">
<text>The Alan Parsons Project were a British rock band formed in London in 1975. Its core membership consisted of producer, audio engineer, musician and composer Alan Parsons, and singer, songwriter and pianist Eric Woolfson. They shared writing credits on almost all of their songs, with Parsons producing or co-producing all of the recordings, while being accompanied by various session musicians, some relatively consistent.

The Alan Parsons Project released eleven studio albums over a 15-year career, the most successful ones being &quot;I Robot&quot; (1977), &quot;The Turn of a Friendly Card&quot; (1980) and &quot;Eye in the Sky&quot; (1982). Many of their albums are conceptual in nature and focus on science fiction, supernatural, literary and sociological themes. Among the group&#x27;s most popular songs are &quot;I Wouldn&#x27;t Want to Be Like You&quot;, &quot;Games People Play&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Sirius&quot;, &quot;Eye in the Sky&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Answer Me&quot;.

== Career ==
=== 1974–1976: Formation and debut ===
Alan Parsons met Eric Woolfson in the canteen of Abbey Road Studios in the summer of 1974. Parsons was assistant engineer on the Beatles&#x27; albums &quot;Abbey Road&quot; (1969) and &quot;Let It Be&quot; (1970), engineered Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; (1973), and produced several acts for EMI Records. Woolfson, a songwriter and composer, was working as a session pianist while composing material for a concept album based on the work of Edgar Allan Poe.

Woolfson&#x27;s idea was to manage Alan and help his already successful production career. It was the start of a longstanding friendly business relationship. He managed Parsons&#x27;s career as a producer and engineer through a string of successes, including Pilot, Steve Harley, Cockney Rebel, John Miles, Al Stewart, Ambrosia, and the Hollies. Woolfson came up with the idea of making an album based on developments in the film industry—the focal point of the films&#x27; promotion shifted from film stars to directors such as Alfred Hitchcock and Stanley Kubrick. If the film industry was becoming a director&#x27;s medium, Woolfson felt the music business might well become a producer&#x27;s medium.

Recalling his earlier Edgar Allan Poe material, Woolfson saw a way to combine his and Parsons&#x27;s talents. Parsons produced and engineered songs written and composed by the two, and the first Alan Parsons Project was begun. The Project&#x27;s first album, &quot;Tales of Mystery and Imagination&quot; (1976), released by 20th Century Fox Records and including major contributions by all members of Pilot and Ambrosia, was a success, reaching the Top 40 in the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. The song &quot;The Raven&quot; featured lead vocals by the actor Leonard Whiting. According to the 2007 re-mastered album liner notes, this was the first rock song to use a vocoder, with Alan Parsons speaking lyrics through it, although others such as Bruce Haack pioneered this field in the previous decade.

=== 1977–1990: Mainstream success and final releases ===

Arista Records then signed the Alan Parsons Project for further albums. Through the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Project&#x27;s popularity continued to grow. The Project was always more popular in North America, Ibero-America, and Continental Europe than in Parsons&#x27; home country, never achieving a UK Top 40 single or Top 20 album. The singles &quot;I Wouldn&#x27;t Want to Be Like You&quot;, &quot;Games People Play&quot;, &quot;Damned If I Do&quot;, &quot;Time&quot; (the first single to feature Woolfson&#x27;s lead vocal) and &quot;Eye in the Sky&quot; had a notable impact on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Don&#x27;t Answer Me&quot; became the Project&#x27;s last successful single in the United States; it reached the top 15 on the American charts in 1984.

After those successes, the Project began to fade from view. There were fewer hit singles, and declining album sales. 1987&#x27;s &quot;Gaudi&quot; was the Project&#x27;s final release, though it had planned to record an album called &quot;Freudiana&quot; (1990) next.

==== The musical &quot;Freudiana&quot; ====
Even though the studio version of &quot;Freudiana&quot; was produced by Parsons (and featured the regular Project session musicians, making it an &#x27;unofficial&#x27; Project album), it was primarily Woolfson&#x27;s idea to turn it into a musical. While Parsons pursued his own solo career and took many session players of the Project on the road for the first time in a successful worldwide tour, Woolfson went on to produce musical plays influenced by the Project&#x27;s music. &quot;Freudiana&quot;, &quot;Gaudi&quot;, and &quot;Gambler&quot; were three musicals that included some Project songs like &quot;Eye in the Sky&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Inside Looking Out&quot;, and &quot;Limelight&quot;. The live music from &quot;Gambler&quot; was only distributed at the performance site in Mönchengladbach, Germany.

==== &quot;The Sicilian Defence&quot; ====
In 1979, Parsons, Woolfson, and their record label Arista, had been stalled in contract renegotiations when the two submitted an all-instrumental album tentatively titled &quot;The Sicilian Defence&quot;, named after an aggressive opening move in chess. Arista&#x27;s refusal to release the album had two known effects: the negotiations led to a renewed contract, and the album was not released at that time.

In interviews he gave before his death in 2009, Woolfson said he planned to release one track from the &quot;Sicilian&quot; album, which in 2008 appeared as a bonus track on a CD re-issue of the &quot;Eve&quot; album. Sometime later, after he had relocated the original tapes, Parsons reluctantly agreed to release the album and announced that it would finally be released on an upcoming Project box set called &quot;The Complete Albums Collection&quot; in 2014 for the first time as a bonus disc.

== Parsons&#x27;s and Woolfson&#x27;s solo careers ==
Parsons released titles under his name: &quot;Try Anything Once&quot; (1993), &quot;On Air&quot; (1996), &quot;The Time Machine&quot; (1999), &quot;A Valid Path&quot; (2004), &quot;The Secret&quot; (2019) and &quot;From the New World&quot; (2022). Meanwhile, Woolfson made concept albums titled &quot;Freudiana&quot; (1990), about Sigmund Freud&#x27;s work on psychology, and &quot;&quot; (2003), continuing from the Alan Parsons Project&#x27;s first album about Poe literature.

&quot;Tales of Mystery and Imagination&quot; (1976) was re-mixed in 1987 for release on CD, and included narration by Orson Welles recorded in 1975, but delivered too late to be included on the original album. For the 2007 deluxe edition release, parts of this tape were used for the 1976 Griffith Park Planetarium launch of the original album, the 1987 remix, and various radio spots. All were included as bonus material.

== Sound ==
The band&#x27;s sound is described as progressive rock, art rock, progressive pop, and soft rock. &quot;Sirius&quot; is their best-known and most-frequently heard of all Parsons/Woolfson songs. It was used as entrance music by various American sports teams, notably by the Chicago Bulls during their 1990s NBA dynasty. It was also used as the entrance theme for Ricky Steamboat in pro wrestling of the mid-1980s. In addition, &quot;Sirius&quot; is played in a variety of TV shows and movies including the BBC series Record Breakers, the episode &quot;Vanishing Act&quot; of &quot;The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius&quot; and the 2009 film &quot;Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs&quot;.

Vocal duties were shared by guests to complement each song. In later years, Woolfson sang lead on many of the group&#x27;s hits, including &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Eye in the Sky&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Answer Me&quot;. The record company pressured Parsons to use Woolfson more, but Parsons preferred to use polished proficient singers; Woolfson admitted he was not in that category. In addition to Woolfson, vocalists Chris Rainbow, Lenny Zakatek, John Miles, David Paton, and Colin Blunstone are regulars. Other singers, such as Arthur Brown, Steve Harley, Gary Brooker, Dave Terry a.k.a. Elmer Gantry, Vitamin Z&#x27;s Geoff Barradale, and Marmalade&#x27;s Dean Ford, recorded only once or twice with the Project. Parsons sang lead on one song (&quot;The Raven&quot;) through a vocoder and backing on a few others, including &quot;To One in Paradise&quot;. Both of those songs appeared on &quot;Tales of Mystery and Imagination&quot; (1976). Parsons also sings a prominent counter melody on &quot;Time&quot;.

A variety of session musicians worked with the Alan Parsons Project regularly, contributing to the recognizable style of a song despite the varied singer line-up. With Parsons and Woolfson, the studio band consisted of the group Pilot, with Ian Bairnson (guitar), David Paton (bass) and Stuart Tosh (drums). Pilot&#x27;s keyboardist Billy Lyall contributed. From &quot;Pyramid&quot; (1978) onward, Tosh was replaced by Stuart Elliott of Cockney Rebel. Bairnson played on all albums, and Paton stayed almost until the end. Andrew Powell appeared as arranger of orchestra (and often choirs) on all albums except &quot;Vulture Culture&quot; (1985); he was composing the score of Richard Donner&#x27;s film &quot;Ladyhawke&quot; (1985). This score was partly in the APP style, recorded by most of the APP regulars, and produced and engineered by Parsons. Powell composed some material for the first two Project albums. For &quot;Vulture Culture&quot; and later, Richard Cottle played as a regular contributor on synthesizers and saxophone.

The Alan Parsons Project played live only once under that name during its original incarnation because Woolfson and Parsons held the roles of writing and production, and because of the technical difficulties of re-producing on stage the complex instrumentation used in the studio. In the 1990s, musical production evolved with the technology of digital samplers. The one occasion the band was introduced as &#x27;the Alan Parsons Project&#x27; in a live performance was at The Night of the Proms in October 1990. The concerts featured all Project regulars except Woolfson, present behind the scenes, while Parsons stayed at the mixer except for the last song, when he played acoustic guitar.

Since 1993, Alan Parsons continues to perform live as the Alan Parsons Live Project to be distinct from the Alan Parsons Project. The current line up consists of lead singer P.J. Olsson, guitarist Jeffrey Kollman, drummer Danny Thompson, keyboardist Tom Brooks, bass guitarist Guy Erez, vocalist and saxophonist Todd Cooper, and guitarist and vocalist Dan Tracey. In 2013, Alan Parsons Live Project played in Colombia with a full choir and orchestra (the Medellin Philharmonic) as &#x27;Alan Parsons Symphonic Project&#x27;. A 2-CD live set and a DVD version of this concert were released in May 2016.

==In popular culture==
In &quot;Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot; (1999), Dr. Evil devised a plan to turn the moon into a &quot;Death Star&quot; using a &quot;laser&quot; invented by Dr. Alan Parsons. He called this &quot;The Alan Parsons Project&quot;.

The opening theme song for the Chicago Bulls has been the song &quot;Sirius&quot; since 1984.

<text>In mathematics, the term &quot;almost all&quot; means &quot;all but a negligible quantity&quot;. More precisely, if formula_1 is a set, &quot;almost all elements of formula_1&quot; means &quot;all elements of formula_1 but those in a negligible subset of formula_1&quot;. The meaning of &quot;negligible&quot; depends on the mathematical context; for instance, it can mean finite, countable, or null.

In contrast, &quot;almost no&quot; means &quot;a negligible quantity&quot;; that is, &quot;almost no elements of formula_1&quot; means &quot;a negligible quantity of elements of formula_1&quot;.

==Meanings in different areas of mathematics==
===Prevalent meaning===

Throughout mathematics, &quot;almost all&quot; is sometimes used to mean &quot;all (elements of an infinite set) except for finitely many&quot;. This use occurs in philosophy as well. Similarly, &quot;almost all&quot; can mean &quot;all (elements of an uncountable set) except for countably many&quot;.

Examples:
* Almost all positive integers are greater than 1012.
* Almost all prime numbers are odd (2 is the only exception).
* Almost all polyhedra are irregular (as there are only nine exceptions: the five platonic solids and the four Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra).
* If P is a nonzero polynomial, then P(x) ≠ 0 for almost all x (if not all &quot;x&quot;).

===Meaning in measure theory===

When speaking about the reals, sometimes &quot;almost all&quot; can mean &quot;all reals except for a null set&quot;. Similarly, if S is some set of reals, &quot;almost all numbers in S&quot; can mean &quot;all numbers in S except for those in a null set&quot;. The real line can be thought of as a one-dimensional Euclidean space. In the more general case of an n-dimensional space (where n is a positive integer), these definitions can be generalised to &quot;all points except for those in a null set&quot; or &quot;all points in S except for those in a null set&quot; (this time, S is a set of points in the space). Even more generally, &quot;almost all&quot; is sometimes used in the sense of &quot;almost everywhere&quot; in measure theory, or in the closely related sense of &quot;almost surely&quot; in probability theory.

Examples:
* In a measure space, such as the real line, countable sets are null. The set of rational numbers is countable, so almost all real numbers are irrational.
* Georg Cantor&#x27;s first set theory article proved that the set of algebraic numbers is countable as well, so almost all reals are transcendental.
* Almost all reals are normal.
* The Cantor set is also null. Thus, almost all reals are not in it even though it is uncountable.
* The derivative of the Cantor function is 0 for almost all numbers in the unit interval. It follows from the previous example because the Cantor function is locally constant, and thus has derivative 0 outside the Cantor set.

===Meaning in number theory===

In number theory, &quot;almost all positive integers&quot; can mean &quot;the positive integers in a set whose natural density is 1&quot;. That is, if A is a set of positive integers, and if the proportion of positive integers in &quot;A&quot; below n (out of all positive integers below n) tends to 1 as n tends to infinity, then almost all positive integers are in A. 

More generally, let S be an infinite set of positive integers, such as the set of even positive numbers or the set of primes, if A is a subset of S, and if the proportion of elements of S below n that are in A (out of all elements of S below n) tends to 1 as n tends to infinity, then it can be said that almost all elements of S are in A.

Examples:
* The natural density of cofinite sets of positive integers is 1, so each of them contains almost all positive integers.
* Almost all positive integers are composite.
* Almost all even positive numbers can be expressed as the sum of two primes.
* Almost all primes are isolated. Moreover, for every positive integer , almost all primes have prime gaps of more than both to their left and to their right; that is, there is no other prime between and .

===Meaning in graph theory===
In graph theory, if A is a set of (finite labelled) graphs, it can be said to contain almost all graphs, if the proportion of graphs with n vertices that are in A tends to 1 as n tends to infinity. However, it is sometimes easier to work with probabilities, so the definition is reformulated as follows. The proportion of graphs with n vertices that are in A equals the probability that a random graph with n vertices (chosen with the uniform distribution) is in A, and choosing a graph in this way has the same outcome as generating a graph by flipping a coin for each pair of vertices to decide whether to connect them. Therefore, equivalently to the preceding definition, the set &quot;A&quot; contains almost all graphs if the probability that a coin-flip–generated graph with n vertices is in A tends to 1 as n tends to infinity. Sometimes, the latter definition is modified so that the graph is chosen randomly in some other way, where not all graphs with n vertices have the same probability, and those modified definitions are not always equivalent to the main one.

The use of the term &quot;almost all&quot; in graph theory is not standard; the term &quot;asymptotically almost surely&quot; is more commonly used for this concept.

Example:
* Almost all graphs are asymmetric.
* Almost all graphs have diameter 2.

===Meaning in topology===
In topology and especially dynamical systems theory (including applications in economics), &quot;almost all&quot; of a topological space&#x27;s points can mean &quot;all of the space&#x27;s points except for those in a meagre set&quot;. Some use a more limited definition, where a subset contains almost all of the space&#x27;s points only if it contains some open dense set.

Example:
* Given an irreducible algebraic variety, the properties that hold for almost all points in the variety are exactly the generic properties. This is due to the fact that in an irreducible algebraic variety equipped with the Zariski topology, all nonempty open sets are dense.

===Meaning in algebra===
In abstract algebra and mathematical logic, if U is an ultrafilter on a set X, &quot;almost all elements of X&quot; sometimes means &quot;the elements of some &quot;element&quot; of U&quot;. For any partition of X into two disjoint sets, one of them will necessarily contain almost all elements of X. It is possible to think of the elements of a filter on X as containing almost all elements of X, even if it isn&#x27;t an ultrafilter.

<text>Aromatic compounds or arenes are organic compounds &quot;with a chemistry typified by benzene&quot; and &quot;cyclically conjugated.&quot;
The word &quot;aromatic&quot; originates from the past grouping of molecules based on odor, before their general chemical properties were understood. The current definition of aromatic compounds does not have any relation to their odor. Aromatic compounds are now defined as cyclic compounds satisfying Hückel&#x27;s Rule.
Aromatic compounds have the following general properties:

* Typically unreactive
* Often non polar and hydrophobic
* High carbon-hydrogen ratio
* Burn with a strong sooty yellow flame, due to high C:H ratio
* Undergo electrophilic substitution reactions and nucleophilic aromatic substitutions

Arenes are typically split into two categories - benzoids, that contain a benzene derivative and follow the benzene ring model, and non-benzoids that contain other aromatic cyclic derivatives. Aromatic compounds are commonly used in organic synthesis and are involved in many reaction types, following both additions and removals, as well as saturation and dearomatization.

== Heteroarenes ==
Heteroarenes are aromatic compounds, where at least one methine or vinylene (-C= or -CH=CH-) group is replaced by a heteroatom: oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur. Examples of non-benzene compounds with aromatic properties are furan, a heterocyclic compound with a five-membered ring that includes a single oxygen atom, and pyridine, a heterocyclic compound with a six-membered ring containing one nitrogen atom. Hydrocarbons without an aromatic ring are called aliphatic. Approximately half of compounds known in 2000 are described as aromatic to some extent.


== Applications ==
Aromatic compounds are pervasive in nature and industry. Key industrial aromatic hydrocarbons are benzene, toluene, xylene called BTX. Many biomolecules have phenyl groups including the so-called aromatic amino acids.

== Benzene ring model ==

Benzene, C6H6, is the least complex aromatic hydrocarbon, and it was the first one defined as such. Its bonding nature was first recognized independently by Joseph Loschmidt and August Kekulé in the 19th century. Each carbon atom in the hexagonal cycle has four electrons to share. One electron forms a sigma bond with the hydrogen atom, and one is used in covalently bonding to each of the two neighboring carbons. This leaves six electrons, shared equally around the ring in delocalized pi molecular orbitals the size of the ring itself. This represents the equivalent nature of the six carbon-carbon bonds all of bond order 1.5. This equivalency can also explained by resonance forms. The electrons are visualized as floating above and below the ring, with the electromagnetic fields they generate acting to keep the ring flat.

The circle symbol for aromaticity was introduced by Sir Robert Robinson and his student James Armit in 1925 and popularized starting in 1959 by the Morrison &amp; Boyd textbook on organic chemistry. The proper use of the symbol is debated: some publications use it to &quot;any&quot; cyclic π system, while others use it only for those π systems that obey Hückel&#x27;s rule. Some argue that, in order to stay in line with Robinson&#x27;s originally intended proposal, the use of the circle symbol should be limited to monocyclic 6 π-electron systems. In this way the circle symbol for a six-center six-electron bond can be compared to the Y symbol for a three-center two-electron bond.

== Benzene and derivatives of benzene ==

Benzene derivatives have from one to six substituents attached to the central benzene core. Examples of benzene compounds with just one substituent are phenol, which carries a hydroxyl group, and toluene with a methyl group. When there is more than one substituent present on the ring, their spatial relationship becomes important for which the arene substitution patterns &quot;ortho&quot;, &quot;meta&quot;, and &quot;para&quot; are devised. When reacting to form more complex benzene derivatives, the substituents on a benzene ring can be described as either activated or deactivated, which are electron donating and electron withdrawing respectively. Activators are known as ortho-para directors, and deactivators are known as meta directors. Upon reacting, substituents will be added at the ortho, para or meta positions, depending on the directivity of the current substituents to make more complex benzene derivatives, often with several isomers. Electron flow leading to re-aromatization is key in ensuring the stability of such products.

For example, three isomers exist for cresol because the methyl group and the hydroxyl group (both ortho para directors) can be placed next to each other (&quot;ortho&quot;), one position removed from each other (&quot;meta&quot;), or two positions removed from each other (&quot;para&quot;). Given that both the methyl and hydroxyl group are ortho-para directors, the ortho and para isomers are typically favoured. Xylenol has two methyl groups in addition to the hydroxyl group, and, for this structure, 6 isomers exist.

Arene rings can stabilize charges, as seen in, for example, phenol (C6H5–OH), which is acidic at the hydroxyl (OH), as charge on the oxygen (alkoxide –O−) is partially delocalized into the benzene ring.

== Non-benzylic arenes ==
Although benzylic arenes are common, non-benzylic compounds are also exceedingly important. Any compound containing a cyclic portion that conforms to Hückel&#x27;s rule and is not a benzene derivative can be considered a non-benzylic aromatic compound.

=== Monocyclic arenes ===
Of annulenes larger than benzene, [12]annulene and [14]annulene are weakly aromatic compounds and [18]annulene, Cyclooctadecanonaene, is aromatic, though strain within the structure causes a slight deviation from the precisely planar structure necessary for aromatic categorization. Another example of a non-benzylic monocyclic arene is the cyclopropenyl (cyclopropenium cation), which satisfies Hückel&#x27;s rule with an n equal to 0. Note, only the cationic form of this cyclic propenyl is aromatic, given that neutrality in this compound would violate either the octet rule or Hückel&#x27;s rule.

Other non-benzylic monocyclic arenes include the aforementioned heteroarenes that can replace carbon atoms with other heteroatoms such as N, O or S. Common examples of these are the five-membered pyrrole and six-membered pyridine, both of which have a substituted nitrogen

=== Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ===

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, also known as polynuclear aromatic compounds (PAHs) are aromatic hydrocarbons that consist of fused aromatic rings and do not contain heteroatoms or carry substituents. Naphthalene is the simplest example of a PAH. PAHs occur in oil, coal, and tar deposits, and are produced as byproducts of fuel burning (whether fossil fuel or biomass). As pollutants, they are of concern because some compounds have been identified as carcinogenic, mutagenic, and teratogenic. PAHs are also found in cooked foods. Studies have shown that high levels of PAHs are found, for example, in meat cooked at high temperatures such as grilling or barbecuing, and in smoked fish. They are also a good candidate molecule to act as a basis for the earliest forms of life. In graphene the PAH motif is extended to large 2D sheets.

==Reactions==
Aromatic ring systems participate in many organic reactions.

===Substitution ===
In aromatic substitution, one substituent on the arene ring, usually hydrogen, is replaced by another reagent. The two main types are electrophilic aromatic substitution, when the active reagent is an electrophile, and nucleophilic aromatic substitution, when the reagent is a nucleophile. In radical-nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the active reagent is a radical.

An example of electrophilic aromatic substitution is the nitration of salicylic acid, where a nitro group is added para to the hydroxide substituent:


Nucleophilic aromatic substitution involves displacement of a leaving group, such as a halide, on an aromatic ring. Aromatic rings usually nucleophilic, but in the presence of electron-withdrawing groups aromatic compounds undergo nucleophilic substitution. Mechanistically, this reaction differs from a common SN2 reaction, because it occurs at a trigonal carbon atom (sp2 hybridization).

===Hydrogenation===
Hydrogenation of arenes create saturated rings. The compound 1-naphthol is completely reduced to a mixture of decalin-ol isomers.
The compound resorcinol, hydrogenated with Raney nickel in presence of aqueous sodium hydroxide forms an enolate which is alkylated with methyl iodide to 2-methyl-1,3-cyclohexandione:

===Dearomatization===
In dearomatization reactions the aromaticity of the reactant is lost. In this regard, the dearomatization is related to hydrogenation. A classic approach is Birch reduction. The methodology is used in synthesis.

<text>An abbey is a type of monastery used by members of a religious order under the governance of an abbot or abbess. Abbeys provide a complex of buildings and land for religious activities, work, and housing of Christian monks and nuns.

The concept of the abbey has developed over many centuries from the early monastic ways of religious men and women where they would live isolated from the lay community about them. Religious life in an abbey may be monastic. An abbey may be the home of an enclosed religious order or may be open to visitors. The layout of the church and associated buildings of an abbey often follows a set plan determined by the founding religious order.

Abbeys are often self-sufficient while using any abundance of produce or skill to provide care to the poor and needy, refuge to the persecuted, or education to the young. Some abbeys offer accommodation to people who are seeking spiritual retreat. There are many famous abbeys across the Mediterranean Basin and Europe.
== Monastic origins of the abbey ==
=== Ascetics and anchorites ===
The earliest known Christian monasteries were groups of huts built near the residence of a famous ascetic or other holy person. Disciples wished to be close to their holy man or woman in order to study their doctrine or imitate their way of life.

In the earliest times of Christian monasticism, ascetics would live in social isolation but near a village church. They would subsist whilst donating any excess produce to the poor. However, increasing religious fervor about the ascetic&#x27;s ways and or persecution of them would drive them further away from their community and further into solitude. For instance, the cells and huts of anchorites (religious recluses) have been found in the deserts of Egypt.

In 312 AD, Anthony the Great retired to the Thebaid region of Egypt to escape the persecution of the Emperor Maximian. Anthony was the best known of the anchorites of his time due to his degree of austerity, sanctity and his powers of exorcism. The deeper he withdrew into the wilderness, the more numerous his disciples became. They refused to be separated from him and built their cells close to him. This became a first true monastic community. According to August Neander, Anthony inadvertently became the founder of a new mode of living in common, Coenobitism.

=== Laurae and Coenobia ===

At Tabennae on the Nile, in Upper Egypt, Saint Pachomius laid the foundations for the coenobitical life by arranging everything in an organized manner. He built several monasteries, each with about 1,600 separate cells laid out in lines. These cells formed an encampment where the monks slept and performed some of their manual tasks. There were nearby large halls such as the church, refectory, kitchen, infirmary, and guest house for the monk&#x27;s common needs. An enclosure protecting all these buildings gave the settlement the appearance of a walled village. This layout, known as the &quot;laurae&quot; (lanes), became popular throughout Israel.

As well as the &quot;laurae&quot;, communities known as &quot;caenobia&quot; developed. These were monasteries where monks lived a common life together. The monks were not permitted to retire to the cells of a laurae before they had undergone a lengthy period of training. In time, this form of common life superseded that of the older laurae.

In the late 300s AD, Palladius visited the Egyptian monasteries. He described three hundred members of the coenobium of Panopolis. There were fifteen tailors, seven smiths, four carpenters, twelve camel-drivers and fifteen tanners. These people were divided into subgroups, each with its own &quot;oeconomus&quot;. A chief steward was at the head of the monastery.

The produce of the monastery was brought to Alexandria for sale. The moneys raised were used to purchase stores for the monastery or were given away as charity. Twice in the year, the superiors of several coenobia met at the chief monastery, under the presidency of an &quot;archimandrite&quot; (the &quot;chief of the fold&quot; from the word, &quot;miandra&quot; (a sheepfold)) in order to make their reports. Chrysostom recorded the workings of a coenobia in the vicinity of Antioch in Syria. The monks lived in separate huts (&quot;kalbbia&quot;) which formed a religious hamlet on the mountainside. They were subject to an abbot, and observed a common rule.

=== Great Lavra, Mount Athos ===

The layout of the monastic coenobium was influenced by a number of factors. These included a need for defence, economy of space, and convenience of access. The layout of buildings became compact and orderly. Larger buildings were erected and defence was provided by strong outside walls. Within the walls, the buildings were arranged around one or more open courts surrounded by cloisters. The usual arrangement for monasteries of the Eastern world is exemplified in the plan of the convent of the Great Lavra at Mount Athos.

With reference to the diagram, right, the convent of the Great Lavra is enclosed within a strong and lofty blank stone wall. The area within the wall is between three and four acres (12,000 and 16,000 m2). The longer side is about in length. There is only one entrance, which is located on the north side (A), defended by three iron doors. Near the entrance is a large tower (M), a constant feature in the monasteries of the Levant (Eastern Mediterranean area). There is a small postern gate at L.

The enceinte comprises two large open courts, surrounded with buildings connected with cloister galleries of wood or stone. The outer court, which is the larger by far, contains the granaries and storehouses (K), the kitchen (H) and other offices connected with the refectory (G). Immediately adjacent to the gateway is a two-storied guest-house, entered from a cloister (C). The inner court is surrounded by a cloister (EE) from which one enters the monks&#x27; cells (II).

In the centre of this court stands the katholikon or conventual church, a square building with an apse of the cruciform domical Byzantine type, approached by a domed narthex. In front of the church stands a marble fountain (F), covered by a dome supported on columns.

Opening from the western side of the cloister, but actually standing in the outer court, is the refectory (G), a large cruciform (cross shaped) building, about square, decorated within with frescoes of saints. At the upper end is a semicircular recess, similar to the triclinium of the Lateran Palace in Rome, in which is placed the seat of the hegumenos or abbot. This apartment is chiefly used as a meeting place, with the monks usually taking their meals in their separate cells.

=== Adoption of the Roman villa plan ===

Monasticism in the West began with the activities of Benedict of Nursia (born 480 AD). Near Nursia, a town in Perugia, Italy, a first abbey was established at Monte Cassino (529 AD). Between 520 and 700 AD, monasteries were built which were spacious and splendid. All the city states of Italy hosted a Benedictine convent as did the cities of England, France and Spain. By 1415 AD, the time of the Council of Constance, 15,070 Benedictine monasteries had been established.

The early Benedictine monasteries, including the first at Monte Cassino, were constructed on the plan of the Roman villa. The layout of the Roman villa was quite consistent throughout the Roman Empire and where possible, the monks reused available villas in sound repair. This was done at Monte Cassino.

However, over time, changes to the common villa lay out occurred. The monks required buildings which suited their religious and day-to-day activities. No overriding specification was demanded of the monks but the similarity of their needs resulted in uniformity of design of abbeys across Europe. Eventually, the buildings of a Benedictine abbey were built in a uniform lay out, modified where necessary, to accommodate local circumstances.

=== Abbey of St Gall ===
The plan of the Abbey of Saint Gall (719 AD) in what is now Switzerland indicates the general arrangement of a Benedictine monastery of its day. According to the architect Robert Willis (architect) (1800–1875) the Abbey&#x27;s lay out is that of a town of individual houses with streets running between them. The abbey was planned in compliance with the Benedictine rule that, if possible, a monastery should be self-contained. For instance, there was a mill, a bakehouse, stables, and cattle stalls. In all, there were thirty-three separate structures; mostly one level wooden buildings.

The Abbey church occupied the centre of a quadrangular area, about square. On the eastern side of the north transept of the church was the &quot;scriptorium&quot; or writing-room, with a library above.

The church and nearby buildings ranged about the cloister, a court about which there was a covered arcade which allowed sheltered movement between the buildings. The nave of the church was on the north boundary of the cloister.

On the east side of the cloister, on the ground floor, was the &quot;pisalis&quot; or &quot;calefactory&quot;. This was a common room, warmed by flues beneath the floor. Above the common room was the dormitory. The dormitory opened onto the cloister and also onto the south transept of the church. This enabled the monks to attend nocturnal services. A passage at the other end of the dormitory lead to the &quot;necessarium&quot; (latrines).

On the south side of the cloister was the refectory. The kitchen, at the west end of the refectory was accessed via an anteroom and a long passage. Nearby were the bake house, brew house and the sleeping-rooms of the servants. The upper story of the refectory was called the &quot;vestiarium&quot; (a room where the ordinary clothes of the monks were stored).

On the western side of the cloister was another two-story building with a cellar on the ground floor and the larder and store-room on the upper floor. Between this building and the church was a parlour for receiving visitors. One door of the parlour led to the cloisters and the other led to the outer part of the Abbey.

Against the outer wall of the church was a school and headmaster&#x27;s house. The school consisted of a large schoolroom divided in the middle by a screen or partition, and surrounded by fourteen little rooms, the &quot;dwellings of the scholars&quot;. The abbot&#x27;s home was near the school.

To the north of the church and to the right of the main entrance to the Abbey, was a residence for distinguished guests. To the left of the main entrance was a building to house poor travellers and pilgrims. There was also a building to receive visiting monks. These &quot;hospitia&quot; had a large common room or refectory surrounded by bed rooms. Each hospitium had its own brewhouse and bakehouse, and the building for more prestigious travellers had a kitchen and storeroom, with bedrooms for the guests&#x27; servants and stables for their horses. The monks of the Abbey lived in a house built against the north wall of the church.

The whole of the southern and western areas of the Abbey were devoted to workshops, stables and farm-buildings including stables, ox-sheds, goatstables, piggeries, and sheep-folds, as well as the servants&#x27; and labourers&#x27; quarters.

In the eastern part of the Abbey there was a group of buildings representing in layout, two complete miniature monasteries. That is, each had a covered cloister surrounded by the usual buildings such as the church, the refectory, the dormitory and so on. A detached building belonging to each contained a bathroom and a kitchen.

One of the miniature complexes was called the &quot;oblati&quot;. These were the buildings for the novices. The other complex was a hospital or infirmary for the care of sick monks. This infirmary complex included a physician&#x27;s residence, a physic garden, a drug store, and a chamber for the critically ill. There was also a room for bloodletting and purging. The physic garden occupied the north east corner of the Abbey.

In the southernmost area of the abbey was the workshop containing utilities for shoemakers, saddlers (or shoemakers, sellarii), cutlers and grinders, trencher-makers, tanners, curriers, fullers, smiths and goldsmiths. The tradesmen&#x27;s living quarters were at the rear of the workshop. Here, there were also farm buildings, a large granary and threshing-floor, mills, and malthouse. At the south-east corner of the Abbey were hen and duck houses, a poultry-yard, and the dwelling of the keeper. Nearby was the kitchen garden which complemented the physic garden and a cemetery orchard.

Every large monastery had priories. A priory was a smaller structure or entities which depended on the monastery. Some were small monasteries accommodating five or ten monks. Others were no more than a single building serving as residence or a farm offices. The outlying farming establishments belonging to the monastic foundations were known as &quot;villae&quot; or &quot;granges&quot;. They were usually staffed by lay-brothers, sometimes under the supervision of a monk.

== Benedictine abbeys in England ==

Many of today&#x27;s cathedrals in England were originally Benedictine monasteries. These included Canterbury, Chester, Durham, Ely, Gloucester, Norwich, Peterborough, Rochester, Winchester, and Worcester. Shrewsbury Abbey in Shropshire was founded as a Benedictine monastery by the Normans in 1083.

=== Westminster Abbey ===
Westminster Abbey was founded in the tenth century by Saint Dunstan who established a community of Benedictine monks. The only traces of St Dunstan&#x27;s monastery remaining are round arches and massive supporting columns of the undercroft and the Pyx Chamber.

The cloister and buildings lie directly to the south of the church. Parallel to the nave, on the south side of the cloister, was a refectory, with a lavatory at the door. On the eastern side, there was a dormitory, raised on a vaulted substructure and communicating with the south transept and a chapter house (meeting room). A small cloister lay to the south-east of the large cloister. Beyond that was an infirmary with a table hall and a refectory for those who were able to leave their chambers. At the west entrance to the Abbey, there was a house and a small courtyard for the abbot.

=== St Mary&#x27;s Abbey, York ===
In 1055, St Mary&#x27;s Abbey, York was built in England&#x27;s north by the Order of Saint Benedict. It followed the common plan. The entrance to the abbey was through a strong gate on the northern side. Close to the entrance was a chapel. This was for visitors arriving at the Abbey to make their devotions. Near the gate was the &quot;hospitium&quot; (guest hall). The buildings are completely ruined, but the walls of the nave and the cloisters are still visible on the grounds of the Yorkshire Museum.

The Abbey was surrounded by fortified walls on three sides. The River Ouse bordered the fourth side. The stone walls remain as an excellent example of English abbey walls.

== Reforms at the Abbey of Cluny ==
The Abbey of Cluny was founded by William I, Duke of Aquitaine in 910 AD at Cluny, Saône-et-Loire, France. The Abbey was built in the Romanesque style. The Abbey was noted for its strict observance of the Rule of Saint Benedict. However, reforms resulted in many departures from this precedent. The Cluniac Reforms brought focus to the traditions of monastic life, encouraging art and the caring of the poor. The reforms quickly spread by the founding of new abbey complexes and by adoption of the reforms by existing abbeys. By the twelfth century, the Abbey of Cluny was the head of an order consisting of 314 monasteries.

The church at the Abbey was commenced in 1089 AD by Hugh of Cluny, the sixth abbot. It was finished and consecrated by Pope Innocent II around 1132 AD. The church was regarded as one of the wonders of the Middle Ages. At in length, it was the largest church in Christendom until the completion of St Peter&#x27;s Basilica at Rome. The church consisted of five naves, a narthex (ante-church) which was added in 1220 AD, and several towers. Together with the conventual buildings, it covered an area of twenty-five acres.

In the Dechristianization of France during the French Revolution in 1790 AD, the Abbey church was bought by the town and almost entirely destroyed. As of 2025, however, fragments of the original Abbey still stand and archaeological excavations have intermittently been conducted over the past century, yielding a massively important and rich source of information.

=== English Cluniac houses ===

The first English house of the Cluniac order was built at Lewes, Sussex. It was founded by William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey in about 1077 AD. All but one of the Cluniac houses in Britain were known as priories, symbolizing their subordination to the Abbot of Cluny. All the Cluniac houses in England and Scotland were French colonies, governed by French priors who travelled to the Abbey of Cluny to consult or be consulted (unless the abbot of Cluny chose to come to Britain, which happened rarely). The priory at Paisley was an exception. In 1245 AD it was raised to the status of an abbey, answerable only to the Pope.

== Abbeys of the Augustinian Canons ==

The Augustinian (or &quot;Austin&quot;) canons were an order of regular clergy within the hierarchy of the Catholic church. They held a position between monks and secular canons. They were known as &quot;Black canons&quot; because of the colour of their habits. In 1105 AD, the first house of the order was established at St Botolph&#x27;s Priory, Colchester, Essex.

The canons built very long naves to accommodate large congregations. The choirs were also long. Sometimes, as at Llanthony Priory and Christchurch, Dorset (Twynham), the choir was closed from the aisles. At other abbeys of the order, such as Bolton Abbey or Kirkham Priory, there were no aisles. The nave in the northern houses of the order often had only a north aisle (this is the case at Bolton, Brinkburn Priory and Lanercost Priory). The arrangement of the monastic buildings followed the ordinary plan. The prior&#x27;s lodge was usually attached to the southwest angle of the nave.

The Austin canons&#x27; house at Thornton, Lincolnshire had a large and magnificent gatehouse. The upper floors of the gatehouse formed the guest-house. The chapter-house was octagonal in shape.

== Augustinian abbeys ==
=== Premonstratensians (Norbertians) ===

The Premonstratensian regular canons, or &quot;White canons&quot;, were of an order founded in 1119 AD by Norbert of Xanten. The order was a reformed branch of the Augustinian canons. From a marshy area in the Forest of Coucy in the diocese of Laon, the order spread widely. Even in Norbert&#x27;s lifetime, the order had built abbeys in Aleppo, Syria, and in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Of the Abbey of Saint Samuel, Denys Pringle wrote, &quot;The Premonstatensian abbey of Saint Samuel was a daughter house of Prémontré itself. Its abbot had the status of a suffragan of the patriarch of Jerusalem, with the right to a cross, but not to a mitre nor a ring.&quot; It long maintained its rigid austerity, though in later years the abbey grew wealthier, and its members indulged in more frequent luxuries.

Just after 1140 AD, the Premonstratensians were brought to England. Their first settlement was at Newhouse Abbey, Lincolnshire, near the Humber tidal estuary. There were as many as thirty-five Premonstratensian abbeys in England. The head abbey in England was at Welbeck Abbey but the best preserved are Easby Abbey in Yorkshire, and Bayham Old Abbey in Kent.

The layout of Easby Abbey is irregular due to its position on the edge of a steep river bank. The cloister is duly placed on the south side of the church, and the chief buildings occupy their usual positions around it. However, the cloister garth (quadrangle), as at Chichester, is not rectangular, and thus, all the surrounding buildings are positioned in an awkward fashion. The church follows the plan adopted by the Austin canons in their northern abbeys, and has only one aisle to the north of the nave, while the choir is long, narrow and without an aisle. Each transept has an aisle to the east, forming three chapels.

The church at Bayham Old Abbey had no aisles in the nave or the choir. The latter terminated in a three-sided apse. The church is remarkable for its extreme narrowness in proportion to its length. While the building is long, it is not more than wide. Premonstratensian canons did not care to have congregations nor possessions. Therefore, they built their churches in the shape of a long room.

== Cistercian abbeys ==


The Cistercians, a Benedictine reform group, were established at Cîteaux in 1098 AD by Robert of Molesme, Abbot of Molesme, for the purpose of restoring, as far as possible, the literal observance of the Rule of Saint Benedict. La Ferté, Pontigny, Clairvaux, and Morimond were the first four abbeys to follow Cîteaux&#x27;s example and others followed. The monks of Cîteaux created the well known vineyards of Clos-Vougeot and Romanée in Burgundy.

The Cistercian principle of rigid self-abnegation carried over to the design of the order&#x27;s churches and buildings. The defining architectural characteristic of the Cistercian abbeys was extreme simplicity and plainness. Only a single, central tower was permitted, and that was usually very low. Unnecessary pinnacles and turrets were prohibited. The triforium was omitted. The windows were usually plain and undivided, and it was forbidden to decorate them with stained glass. All needless ornament was proscribed. The crosses were made of wood and the candlesticks of iron.

The same principle governed the choice of site for Cistercian abbeys in that a most dismal site might be improved by the building of an abbey. The Cistercian monasteries were founded in deep, well-watered valleys, always standing at a stream&#x27;s edge. The building might extend over the water as is the case at Fountains Abbey. These valleys, now rich and productive, had a very different appearance when the brethren first chose them as their place of retreat. Wide swamps, deep morasses, tangled thickets, and wild, impassable forests were their prevailing features. Clara Vallis of St Bernard, now the &quot;bright valley&quot; was originally, the &quot;Valley of Wormwood&quot;. It was an infamous den of robbers.

The plan of a Coptic Orthodox monastery, from Lenoir, shows a church of three aisles, with cellular apses, and two ranges of cells on either side of an oblong gallery.

<text>The &quot;Annales&quot; school () is a group of historians associated with a style of historiography developed by French historians in the 20th century to stress long-term social history. It is named after its scholarly journal &quot;Annales. Histoire, Sciences Sociales&quot;, which remains the main source of scholarship, along with many books and monographs. The school has been influential in setting the agenda for historiography in France and numerous other countries, especially regarding the use of social scientific methods by historians, emphasizing social and economic rather than political or diplomatic themes.

The school deals primarily with late medieval and early modern Europe (before the French Revolution), with little interest in later topics. It has dominated French social history and heavily influenced historiography in Europe and Latin America. Prominent leaders include co-founders Lucien Febvre (1878–1956), Henri Hauser (1866–1946) and Marc Bloch (1886–1944). The second generation was led by Fernand Braudel (1902–1985) and included Georges Duby (1919–1996), Pierre Goubert (1915–2012), Robert Mandrou (1921–1984), Pierre Chaunu (1923–2009), Jacques Le Goff (1924–2014), and Ernest Labrousse (1895–1988). Institutionally it is based on the &quot;Annales&quot; journal, the SEVPEN publishing house, the (FMSH), and especially the 6th Section of the École pratique des hautes études, all based in Paris. A third generation was led by Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie (1929–2023) and includes Jacques Revel, and Philippe Ariès (1914–1984), who joined the group in 1978. The third generation stressed history from the point of view of mentalities, or . The fourth generation of &quot;Annales&quot; historians, led by Roger Chartier (born 1945), clearly distanced itself from the approach, replaced by the cultural and linguistic turn, which emphasizes the social history of cultural practices.

The main scholarly outlet has been the journal (&quot;Annals of Economic and Social History&quot;), founded in 1929 by Lucien Febvre and Marc Bloch, which broke radically with traditional historiography by insisting on the importance of taking all levels of society into consideration and emphasized the collective nature of mentalities. Its contributors viewed events as less fundamental than the mental frameworks that shaped decisions and practices. However, informal successor as head of the school was Le Roy Ladurie. Multiple responses were attempted by the school. Scholars moved in multiple directions, covering in disconnected fashion the social, economic, and cultural history of different eras and different parts of the globe. By the time of the crisis the school was building a vast publishing and research network reaching across France, Europe, and the rest of the world. Influence spread out from Paris, but few new ideas came in. Much emphasis was given to quantitative data, seen as the key to unlocking all of social history. However, the &quot;Annales&quot; ignored the developments in quantitative studies underway in the U.S. and Britain, which reshaped economic, political, and demographic research. An attempt to require an &quot;Annales&quot;-written textbook for French schools was rejected by the government. By 1980 postmodern sensibilities undercut confidence in overarching metanarratives. As Jacques Revel notes, the success of the &quot;Annales&quot; school, especially its use of social structures as explanatory forces, contained the seeds of its own downfall, for there is &quot;no longer any implicit consensus on which to base the unity of the social, identified with the real&quot;. The &quot;Annales&quot; school kept its infrastructure, but lost its .

==The journal==

The journal began in Strasbourg as ; it moved to Paris and kept the same name from 1929 to 1939. It was successively renamed (1939–1942, 1945), (1942–1944), (1946–1994), and (1994– ).

In 1962, Braudel and Gaston Berger used Ford Foundation money and government funds to create a new independent foundation, the (FMSH), which Braudel directed from 1970 until his death. In 1970, the 6th Section and the &quot;Annales&quot; relocated to the FMSH building. FMSH set up elaborate international networks to spread the &quot;Annales&quot; gospel across Europe and the world. In 2013, it began publication of an English language edition, with all the articles translated.

The scope of topics covered by the journal is vast and experimental—there is a search for total history and new approaches. The emphasis is on social history, and very long-term trends, often using quantification and paying special attention to geography and to the intellectual world view of common people, or &quot;mentality&quot; (). Little attention is paid to political, diplomatic, or military history, or to biographies of famous men. Instead the &quot;Annales&quot; focused attention on the synthesizing of historical patterns identified from social, economic, and cultural history, statistics, medical reports, family studies, and even psychoanalysis.

==Origins==
The &quot;Annales&quot; was founded and edited by Marc Bloch and Lucien Febvre in 1929, while they were teaching at the University of Strasbourg and later in Paris. These authors, the former a medieval historian and the latter an early modernist, quickly became associated with the distinctive &quot;Annales&quot; approach, which combined geography, history, and the sociological approaches of the (many members of which were their colleagues at Strasbourg) to produce an approach which rejected the predominant emphasis on politics, diplomacy and war of many 19th and early 20th-century historians as spearheaded by historians whom Febvre called Les Sorbonnistes. Instead, they pioneered an approach to a study of long-term historical structures () over events and political transformations. Geography, material culture, and what later Annalistes called , or the psychology of the epoch, are also characteristic areas of study. The goal of the Annales was to undo the work of the Sorbonnistes, to turn French historians away from the narrowly political and diplomatic toward the new vistas in social and economic history.

Co-founder Marc Bloch (1886–1944) was a quintessential modernist who studied at the elite École Normale Supérieure, and in Germany, serving as a professor at the University of Strasbourg until he was called to the Sorbonne in Paris in 1936 as professor of economic history. Bloch&#x27;s interests were highly interdisciplinary, influenced by the geography of Paul Vidal de la Blache (1845–1918) and the sociology of Émile Durkheim (1858–1917). His own ideas, especially those expressed in his masterworks, &quot;French Rural History&quot; (, 1931) and &quot;Feudal Society&quot;, were incorporated by the second-generation Annalistes, led by Fernand Braudel.

==Precepts==
Georges Duby, a leader of the school, wrote that the history he taught:
:relegated the sensational to the sidelines and was reluctant to give a simple accounting of events, but strove on the contrary to pose and solve problems and, neglecting surface disturbances, to observe the long and medium-term evolution of economy, society and civilisation.
The Annalistes, especially Lucien Febvre, advocated a , or , a complete study of a historic problem.

==Postwar==
Bloch was shot by the Gestapo during the German occupation of France in World War II for his active membership of the French Resistance, and Febvre carried on the &quot;Annales&quot; approach in the 1940s and 1950s. It was during this time that he mentored Braudel, who would become one of the best-known exponents of this school. Braudel&#x27;s work came to define a &quot;second&quot; era of &quot;Annales&quot; historiography and was influential throughout the 1960s and 1970s, especially for his work on the Mediterranean region in the era of Philip II of Spain. 
Braudel developed the idea, often associated with Annalistes, of different modes of historical time: (the quasi motionless history) of historical geography, the history of social, political and economic structures (), and the history of men and events, in the context of their structures.

While authors such as Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, Marc Ferro and Jacques Le Goff continue to carry the &quot;Annales&quot; banner, today the &quot;Annales&quot; approach has been less distinctive as more and more historians do work in cultural history, political history and economic history.
Bloch&#x27;s (1924) looked at the long-standing folk belief that the king could cure scrofula by his thaumaturgic touch. The kings of France and England indeed regularly practiced the ritual. Bloch was not concerned with the effectiveness of the royal touch—he acted instead like an anthropologist in asking why people believed it and how it shaped relations between king and commoner. The book was highly influential in introducing comparative studies (in this case France and England), as well as long durations (&quot;longue durée&quot;) studies spanning several centuries, even up to a thousand years, downplaying short-term events. Bloch&#x27;s revolutionary charting of mentalities, or , resonated with scholars who were reading Freud and Proust. In the 1960s, Robert Mandrou and Georges Duby harmonized the concept of history with Fernand Braudel&#x27;s structures of historical time and linked mentalities with changing social conditions. A flood of studies based on these approaches appeared during the 1970s and 1980s. By the 1990s, however, history had become interdisciplinary to the point of fragmentation, but still lacked a solid theoretical basis. While not explicitly rejecting history, younger historians increasingly turned to other approaches.

==Braudel==
Fernand Braudel became the leader of the second generation after 1945. He obtained funding from the Rockefeller Foundation in New York and founded the 6th Section of the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, which was devoted to the study of history and the social sciences. It became an independent degree-granting institution in 1975 under the name École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales (EHESS). Braudel&#x27;s followers admired his use of the approach to stress slow, and often imperceptible effects of space, climate and technology on the actions of human beings in the past. The &quot;Annales&quot; historians, after living through two world wars and incredible political upheavals in France, were deeply uncomfortable with the notion that multiple ruptures and discontinuities created history. They preferred to stress inertia and the longue durée. Special attention was paid to geography, climate, and demography as long-term factors. They believed the continuities of the deepest structures were central to history, beside which upheavals in institutions or the superstructure of social life were of little significance, for history lies beyond the reach of conscious actors, especially the will of revolutionaries. They rejected the Marxist idea that history should be used as a tool to foment and foster revolutions. In turn the Marxists called them conservatives.

Braudel&#x27;s first book, (1949) (&quot;The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II&quot;) was his most influential. This vast panoramic view used ideas from other social sciences, employed effectively the technique of the longue durée, and downplayed the importance of specific events and individuals. It stressed geography but not . It was widely admired, but most historians did not try to replicate it and instead focused on their specialized monographs. The book dramatically raised the worldwide profile of the Annales School.

In 1951, historian Bernard Bailyn published a critique of , which he framed as dichotomizing politics and society.

==Regionalism==
Before &quot;Annales&quot;, French history supposedly happened in Paris. Febvre broke decisively with this paradigm in 1912, with his sweeping doctoral thesis on . The geography and social structure of this region overwhelmed and shaped the king&#x27;s policies.

The &quot;Annales&quot; historians did not try to replicate Braudel&#x27;s vast geographical scope in . Instead they focused on regions in France over long stretches of time. The most important was the study of &quot;The Peasants of Languedoc&quot; by Braudel&#x27;s star pupil and successor Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie. The regionalist tradition flourished especially in the 1960s and 1970s in the work of Pierre Goubert in 1960 on Beauvais and René Baehrel on Basse-Provence. &quot;Annales&quot; historians in the 1970s and 1980s turned to urban regions, including Pierre Deyon (Amiens), Maurice Garden (Lyon), Jean-Pierre Bardet (Rouen), Georges Freche (Toulouse), Gregory Hanlon (Agen and Layrac), and Jean-Claude Perrot (Caen). By the 1970s the shift was underway from the earlier economic history to cultural history and the history of mentalities.

==Impact outside France==
The &quot;Annales&quot; school systematically reached out to create an impact on other countries. Its success varied widely. The &quot;Annales&quot; approach was especially well received in Italy and Poland. Franciszek Bujak (1875–1953) and Jan Rutkowski (1886–1949), the founders of modern economic history in Poland and of the journal (1931– ), were attracted to the innovations of the Annales school. Rutkowski was in contact with Bloch and others, and published in the &quot;Annales&quot;. After the Communists took control in the 1940s Polish scholars were safer working on the Middle Ages and the early modern era rather than contemporary history. After the &quot;Polish October&quot; of 1956 the Sixth Section in Paris welcomed Polish historians and exchanges between the circle of the &quot;Annales&quot; and Polish scholars continued until the early 1980s. The reciprocal influence between the French school and Polish historiography was particularly evident in studies on the Middle Ages and the early modern era studied by Braudel.

In South America the &quot;Annales&quot; approach became popular. From the 1950s Federico Brito Figueroa was the founder of a new Venezuelan historiography based largely on the ideas of the Annales School. Brito Figueroa carried his conception of the field to all levels of university study, emphasizing a systematic and scientific approach to history and placing it squarely in the social sciences. Spanish historiography was influenced by the &quot;Annales School&quot; starting in 1950 with Jaume Vicens Vives (1910–1960). In Mexico, exiled Republican intellectuals extended the Annales approach, particularly from the Center for Historical Studies of El Colegio de México, the leading graduate studies institution of Latin America.

British historians, apart from a few Marxists, were generally hostile. Academic historians decidedly sided with Geoffrey Elton&#x27;s &quot;The Practice of History&quot; against Edward Hallett Carr&#x27;s &quot;What Is History?&quot; One of the few British historians who were sympathetic towards the work of the &quot;Annales&quot; school was Hugh Trevor-Roper. Among American academics, founding figure in American history of technology Lynn White Jr. dedicated his seminal and controversial book &quot;Medieval Technology and Social Change&quot; to &quot;Annales&quot; founder Marc Bloch. Both the American and the &quot;Annales&quot; historians picked up important family reconstitution techniques from French demographer Louis Henry.

The Wageningen school centered on Bernard Slicher van Bath was viewed internationally as a Dutch counterpart of the Annales school, although Slicher van Bath himself vehemently rejected the idea of a quantitative &quot;school&quot; of historiography.

The &quot;Annales&quot; school has been cited as a key influence in the development of World Systems Theory by sociologist Immanuel Wallerstein.

==Current==
The current leader is Roger Chartier, who is Directeur d&#x27;Études at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales in Paris, Professeur in the Collège de France, and Annenberg Visiting professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania. He frequently lectures and teaches in the United States, Spain, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. His work in Early Modern European History focuses on the history of education, the history of the book and the history of reading. Recently, he has been concerned with the relationship between written culture as a whole and literature (particularly theatrical plays) for France, England and Spain. His work in this specific field (based on the criss-crossing between literary criticism, bibliography, and sociocultural history) is connected to broader historiographical and methodological interests which deal with the relation between history and other disciplines: philosophy, sociology, anthropology.

Chartier&#x27;s typical undergraduate course focuses upon the making, remaking, dissemination, and reading of texts in early modern Europe and America. Under the heading of &quot;practices&quot;, his class considers how readers read and marked up their books, forms of note-taking, and the interrelation between reading and writing from copying and translating to composing new texts. Under the heading of &quot;materials&quot;, his class examines the relations between different kinds of writing surfaces (including stone, wax, parchment, paper, walls, textiles, the body, and the heart), writing implements (including styluses, pens, pencils, needles, and brushes), and material forms (including scrolls, erasable tables, codices, broadsides and printed forms and books). Under the heading of &quot;places&quot;, his class explores where texts were made, read, and listened to, including monasteries, schools and universities, offices of the state, the shops of merchants and booksellers, printing houses, theaters, libraries, studies, and closets. The texts for his course include the &quot;Bible&quot;, translations of Ovid, &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, Montaigne&#x27;s essays, Pepys&#x27;s diary, Richardson&#x27;s &quot;Pamela&quot;, and Franklin&#x27;s autobiography.

<doc id="1317" wikidata="Q83197" url="?curid=1317" title="Antimatter">
<text>In modern physics, antimatter is defined as matter composed of the antiparticles (or &quot;partners&quot;) of the corresponding particles in &quot;ordinary&quot; matter, and can be thought of as matter with reversed charge, parity, and time, known as CPT reversal. Antimatter occurs in natural processes like cosmic ray collisions and some types of radioactive decay, but only a tiny fraction of these have successfully been bound together in experiments to form antiatoms. Minuscule numbers of antiparticles can be generated at particle accelerators, but total artificial production has been only a few nanograms. No macroscopic amount of antimatter has ever been assembled due to the extreme cost and difficulty of production and handling. Nonetheless, antimatter is an essential component of widely available applications related to beta decay, such as positron emission tomography, radiation therapy, and industrial imaging.

In theory, a particle and its antiparticle (for example, a proton and an antiproton) have the same mass, but opposite electric charge, and other differences in quantum numbers.

A collision between any particle and its anti-particle partner leads to their mutual annihilation, giving rise to various proportions of intense photons (gamma rays), neutrinos, and sometimes less-massive particleantiparticle pairs. The majority of the total energy of annihilation emerges in the form of ionizing radiation. If surrounding matter is present, the energy content of this radiation will be absorbed and converted into other forms of energy, such as heat or light. The amount of energy released is usually proportional to the total mass of the collided matter and antimatter, in accordance with the notable mass–energy equivalence equation, .

Antiparticles bind with each other to form antimatter, just as ordinary particles bind to form normal matter. For example, a positron (the antiparticle of the electron) and an antiproton (the antiparticle of the proton) can form an antihydrogen atom. The nuclei of antihelium have been artificially produced, albeit with difficulty, and are the most complex anti-nuclei so far observed. Physical principles indicate that complex antimatter atomic nuclei are possible, as well as anti-atoms corresponding to the known chemical elements.

There is strong evidence that the observable universe is composed almost entirely of ordinary matter, as opposed to an equal mixture of matter and antimatter. This asymmetry of matter and antimatter in the visible universe is one of the great unsolved problems in physics. The process by which this inequality between matter and antimatter particles is hypothesised to have occurred is called baryogenesis.

==Definitions==
Antimatter particles carry the same charge as matter particles, but of opposite sign. That is, an antiproton is negatively charged and an antielectron (positron) is positively charged. Neutrons do not carry a net charge, but their constituent quarks do. Protons and neutrons have a baryon number of +1, while antiprotons and antineutrons have a baryon number of –1. Similarly, electrons have a lepton number of +1, while that of positrons is –1. When a particle and its corresponding antiparticle collide, they are both converted into energy.

The French term for &quot;made of or pertaining to antimatter&quot;, , led to the initialism &quot;C.T.&quot; and the science fiction term , as used in such novels as &quot;Seetee Ship&quot;.

==Conceptual history==
The idea of negative matter appears in past theories of matter that have now been abandoned. Using the once popular vortex theory of gravity, the possibility of matter with negative gravity was discussed by William Hicks in the 1880s. Between the 1880s and the 1890s, Karl Pearson proposed the existence of &quot;squirts&quot; and sinks of the flow of aether. The squirts represented normal matter and the sinks represented negative matter. Pearson&#x27;s theory required a fourth dimension for the aether to flow from and into.

The term antimatter was first used by Arthur Schuster in two rather whimsical letters to &quot;Nature&quot; in 1898, in which he coined the term. He hypothesized antiatoms, as well as whole antimatter solar systems, and discussed the possibility of matter and antimatter annihilating each other. Schuster&#x27;s ideas were not a serious theoretical proposal, merely speculation, and like the previous ideas, differed from the modern concept of antimatter in that it possessed negative gravity.

The modern theory of antimatter began in 1928, with a paper by Paul Dirac. Dirac realised that his relativistic version of the Schrödinger wave equation for electrons predicted the possibility of antielectrons. Although Dirac had laid the groundwork for the existence of these “antielectrons” he initially failed to pick up on the implications contained within his own equation. He freely gave the credit for that insight to J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose seminal paper “On the Theory of Electrons and Protons” (Feb 14th 1930) drew on Dirac&#x27;s equation and argued for the existence of a positively charged electron (a positron), which as a counterpart to the electron should have the same mass as the electron itself. This meant that it could not be, as Dirac had in fact suggested, a proton. Dirac further postulated the existence of antimatter in a 1931 paper which referred to the positron as an &quot;anti-electron&quot;. These were discovered by Carl D. Anderson in 1932 and named positrons from &quot;positive electron&quot;. Although Dirac did not himself use the term antimatter, its use follows on naturally enough from antielectrons, antiprotons, etc. A complete periodic table of antimatter was envisaged by Charles Janet in 1929.

The Feynman–Stueckelberg interpretation states that antimatter and antiparticles behave exactly identical to regular particles, but traveling backward in time. This concept is nowadays used in modern particle physics, in Feynman diagrams.

==Notation==
One way to denote an antiparticle is by adding a bar over the particle&#x27;s symbol. For example, the proton and antiproton are denoted as and , respectively. The same rule applies if one were to address a particle by its constituent components. A proton is made up of quarks, so an antiproton must therefore be formed from antiquarks. Another convention is to distinguish particles by positive and negative electric charge. Thus, the electron and positron are denoted simply as and respectively. To prevent confusion, however, the two conventions are never mixed.

==Properties==
There is no difference in the gravitational behavior of matter and antimatter. In other words, antimatter falls down when dropped, not up. This was confirmed with the thin, very cold gas of thousands of antihydrogen atoms that were confined in a vertical shaft surrounded by superconducting electromagnetic coils. These can create a magnetic bottle to keep the antimatter from coming into contact with matter and annihilating. The researchers then gradually weakened the magnetic fields and detected the antiatoms using two sensors as they escaped and annihilated. Most of the anti-atoms came out of the bottom opening, and only one-quarter out of the top.

There are compelling theoretical reasons to believe that, aside from the fact that antiparticles have different signs on all charges (such as electric and baryon charges), matter and antimatter have exactly the same properties. This means a particle and its corresponding antiparticle must have identical masses and decay lifetimes (if unstable). It also implies that, for example, a star made up of antimatter (an &quot;antistar&quot;) will shine just like an ordinary star. This idea was tested experimentally in 2016 by the ALPHA experiment, which measured the transition between the two lowest energy states of antihydrogen. The results, which are identical to that of hydrogen, confirmed the validity of quantum mechanics for antimatter.

==Origin and asymmetry==


Most things observable from the Earth seem to be made of matter rather than antimatter. If antimatter-dominated regions of space existed, the gamma rays produced in annihilation reactions along the boundary between matter and antimatter regions would be detectable.

Antiparticles are created everywhere in the universe where high-energy particle collisions take place. High-energy cosmic rays striking Earth&#x27;s atmosphere (or any other matter in the Solar System) produce minute quantities of antiparticles in the resulting particle jets, which are immediately annihilated by contact with nearby matter. They may similarly be produced in regions like the center of the Milky Way and other galaxies, where very energetic celestial events occur (principally the interaction of relativistic jets with the interstellar medium). The presence of the resulting antimatter is detectable by the two gamma rays produced every time positrons annihilate with nearby matter. The frequency and wavelength of the gamma rays indicate that each carries 511 keV of energy (that is, the rest mass of an electron multiplied by &quot;c&quot;2).

Observations by the European Space Agency&#x27;s INTEGRAL satellite may explain the origin of a giant antimatter cloud surrounding the Galactic Center. The observations show that the cloud is asymmetrical and matches the pattern of X-ray binaries (binary star systems containing black holes or neutron stars), mostly on one side of the Galactic Center. While the mechanism is not fully understood, it is likely to involve the production of electron–positron pairs, as ordinary matter gains kinetic energy while falling into a stellar remnant.

Antimatter may exist in relatively large amounts in far-away galaxies due to cosmic inflation in the primordial time of the universe. Antimatter galaxies, if they exist, are expected to have the same chemistry and absorption and emission spectra as normal-matter galaxies, and their astronomical objects would be observationally identical, making them difficult to distinguish. NASA is trying to determine if such galaxies exist by looking for X-ray and gamma ray signatures of annihilation events in colliding superclusters.

In October 2017, scientists working on the BASE experiment at CERN reported a measurement of the antiproton magnetic moment to a precision of 1.5 parts per billion. It is consistent with the most precise measurement of the proton magnetic moment (also made by BASE in 2014), which supports the hypothesis of CPT symmetry. This measurement represents the first time that a property of antimatter is known more precisely than the equivalent property in matter.

Antimatter quantum interferometry has been first demonstrated in 2018 in the Positron Laboratory (L-NESS) of Rafael Ferragut in Como (Italy), by a group led by Marco Giammarchi.

==Natural production==
Positrons are produced naturally in β+ decays of naturally occurring radioactive isotopes (for example, potassium-40) and in interactions of gamma quanta (emitted by radioactive nuclei) with matter. Antineutrinos are another kind of antiparticle created by natural radioactivity (β− decay). Many different kinds of antiparticles are also produced by (and contained in) cosmic rays. In January 2011, research by the American Astronomical Society discovered antimatter (positrons) originating above thunderstorm clouds; positrons are produced in terrestrial gamma ray flashes created by electrons accelerated by strong electric fields in the clouds. Antiprotons have also been found to exist in the Van Allen Belts around the Earth by the PAMELA module.

Antiparticles are also produced in any environment with a sufficiently high temperature (mean particle energy greater than the pair production threshold). It is hypothesized that during the period of baryogenesis, when the universe was extremely hot and dense, matter and antimatter were continually produced and annihilated. The presence of remaining matter, and absence of detectable remaining antimatter, is called baryon asymmetry. The exact mechanism that produced this asymmetry during baryogenesis remains an unsolved problem. One of the necessary conditions for this asymmetry is the violation of CP symmetry, which has been experimentally observed in the weak interaction.

Recent observations indicate black holes and neutron stars produce vast amounts of positron-electron plasma via the jets.

===Observation in cosmic rays===
Satellite experiments have found evidence of positrons and a few antiprotons in primary cosmic rays, amounting to less than 1% of the particles in primary cosmic rays. This antimatter cannot all have been created in the Big Bang, but is instead attributed to have been produced by cyclic processes at high energies. For instance, electron-positron pairs may be formed in pulsars, as a magnetized neutron star rotation cycle shears electron-positron pairs from the star surface. Therein the antimatter forms a wind that crashes upon the ejecta of the progenitor supernovae. This weathering takes place as &quot;the cold, magnetized relativistic wind launched by the star hits the non-relativistically expanding ejecta, a shock wave system forms in the impact: the outer one propagates in the ejecta, while a reverse shock propagates back towards the star.&quot; The former ejection of matter in the outer shock wave and the latter production of antimatter in the reverse shock wave are steps in a space weather cycle.

Preliminary results from the presently operating Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (&quot;AMS-02&quot;) on board the International Space Station show that positrons in the cosmic rays arrive with no directionality, and with energies that range from 10 GeV to 250 GeV. In September, 2014, new results with almost twice as much data were presented in a talk at CERN and published in Physical Review Letters. A new measurement of positron fraction up to 500 GeV was reported, showing that positron fraction peaks at a maximum of about 16% of total electron+positron events, around an energy of 275 ± 32 GeV. At higher energies, up to 500 GeV, the ratio of positrons to electrons begins to fall again. The absolute flux of positrons also begins to fall before 500 GeV, but peaks at energies far higher than electron energies, which peak about 10 GeV. These results on interpretation have been suggested to be due to positron production in annihilation events of massive dark matter particles.

Cosmic ray antiprotons also have a much higher energy than their normal-matter counterparts (protons). They arrive at Earth with a characteristic energy maximum of 2 GeV, indicating their production in a fundamentally different process from cosmic ray protons, which on average have only one-sixth of the energy.

There is an ongoing search for larger antimatter nuclei, such as antihelium nuclei (that is, anti-alpha particles), in cosmic rays. The detection of natural antihelium could imply the existence of large antimatter structures such as an antistar. A prototype of the &quot;AMS-02&quot; designated &quot;AMS-01&quot;, was flown into space aboard the on STS-91 in June 1998. By not detecting any antihelium at all, the &quot;AMS-01&quot; established an upper limit of 1.1×10−6 for the antihelium to helium flux ratio. AMS-02 revealed in December 2016 that it had discovered a few signals consistent with antihelium nuclei amidst several billion helium nuclei. The result remains to be verified, and , the team is trying to rule out contamination.

==Artificial production==

===Positrons===
Positrons were reported in November 2008 to have been generated by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in large numbers. A laser drove electrons through a gold target&#x27;s nuclei, which caused the incoming electrons to emit energy quanta that decayed into both matter and antimatter. Positrons were detected at a higher rate and in greater density than ever previously detected in a laboratory. Previous experiments made smaller quantities of positrons using lasers and paper-thin targets; newer simulations showed that short bursts of ultra-intense lasers and millimeter-thick gold are a far more effective source.

In 2023, the production of the first electron-positron beam-plasma was reported by a collaboration led by researchers at University of Oxford working with the High-Radiation to Materials (HRMT) facility at CERN. The beam demonstrated the highest positron yield achieved so far in a laboratory setting. The experiment employed the 440 GeV proton beam, with formula_1 protons, from the Super Proton Synchrotron, and irradiated a particle converter composed of carbon and tantalum. This yielded a total formula_2 electron-positron pairs via a particle shower process. The produced pair beams have a volume that fills multiple Debye spheres and are thus able to sustain collective plasma oscillations.

===Antiprotons, antineutrons, and antinuclei===
The existence of the antiproton was experimentally confirmed in 1955 by University of California, Berkeley physicists Emilio Segrè and Owen Chamberlain, for which they were awarded the 1959 Nobel Prize in Physics. An antiproton consists of two up antiquarks and one down antiquark (). The properties of the antiproton that have been measured all match the corresponding properties of the proton, with the exception of the antiproton having opposite electric charge and magnetic moment from the proton. Shortly afterwards, in 1956, the antineutron was discovered in proton–proton collisions at the Bevatron (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) by Bruce Cork and colleagues.

In addition to antibaryons, anti-nuclei consisting of multiple bound antiprotons and antineutrons have been created. These are typically produced at energies far too high to form antimatter atoms (with bound positrons in place of electrons). In 1965, a group of researchers led by Antonino Zichichi reported production of nuclei of antideuterium at the Proton Synchrotron at CERN. At roughly the same time, observations of antideuterium nuclei were reported by a group of American physicists at the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron at Brookhaven National Laboratory.

===Antihydrogen atoms===

In 1995, CERN announced that it had successfully brought into existence nine hot antihydrogen atoms by implementing the SLAC/Fermilab concept during the PS210 experiment. The experiment was performed using the Low Energy Antiproton Ring (LEAR), and was led by Walter Oelert and Mario Macri. Fermilab soon confirmed the CERN findings by producing approximately 100 antihydrogen atoms at their facilities. The antihydrogen atoms created during PS210 and subsequent experiments (at both CERN and Fermilab) were extremely energetic and were not well suited to study. To resolve this hurdle, and to gain a better understanding of antihydrogen, two collaborations were formed in the late 1990s, namely, ATHENA and ATRAP.

In 1999, CERN activated the Antiproton Decelerator, a device capable of decelerating antiprotons from to  – still too &quot;hot&quot; to produce study-effective antihydrogen, but a huge leap forward. In late 2002 the ATHENA project announced that they had created the world&#x27;s first &quot;cold&quot; antihydrogen. The ATRAP project released similar results very shortly thereafter. The antiprotons used in these experiments were cooled by decelerating them with the Antiproton Decelerator, passing them through a thin sheet of foil, and finally capturing them in a Penning–Malmberg trap. The overall cooling process is workable, but highly inefficient; approximately 25 million antiprotons leave the Antiproton Decelerator and roughly 25,000 make it to the Penning–Malmberg trap, which is about or 0.1% of the original amount.

The antiprotons are still hot when initially trapped. To cool them further, they are mixed into an electron plasma. The electrons in this plasma cool via cyclotron radiation, and then sympathetically cool the antiprotons via Coulomb collisions. Eventually, the electrons are removed by the application of short-duration electric fields, leaving the antiprotons with energies less than . While the antiprotons are being cooled in the first trap, a small cloud of positrons is captured from radioactive sodium in a Surko-style positron accumulator. This cloud is then recaptured in a second trap near the antiprotons. Manipulations of the trap electrodes then tip the antiprotons into the positron plasma, where some combine with antiprotons to form antihydrogen. This neutral antihydrogen is unaffected by the electric and magnetic fields used to trap the charged positrons and antiprotons, and within a few microseconds the antihydrogen hits the trap walls, where it annihilates. Some hundreds of millions of antihydrogen atoms have been made in this fashion.

In 2005, ATHENA disbanded and some of the former members (along with others) formed the ALPHA Collaboration, which is also based at CERN. The ultimate goal of this endeavour is to test CPT symmetry through comparison of the atomic spectra of hydrogen and antihydrogen (see hydrogen spectral series).

Most of the sought-after high-precision tests of the properties of antihydrogen could only be performed if the antihydrogen were trapped, that is, held in place for a relatively long time. While antihydrogen atoms are electrically neutral, the spins of their component particles produce a magnetic moment. These magnetic moments can interact with an inhomogeneous magnetic field; some of the antihydrogen atoms can be attracted to a magnetic minimum. Such a minimum can be created by a combination of mirror and multipole fields. Antihydrogen can be trapped in such a magnetic minimum (minimum-B) trap; in November 2010, the ALPHA collaboration announced that they had so trapped 38 antihydrogen atoms for about a sixth of a second. This was the first time that neutral antimatter had been trapped.

On 26 April 2011, ALPHA announced that they had trapped 309 antihydrogen atoms, some for as long as 1,000 seconds (about 17 minutes). This was longer than neutral antimatter had ever been trapped before. ALPHA has used these trapped atoms to initiate research into the spectral properties of antihydrogen.

In 2016, a new antiproton decelerator and cooler called ELENA (Extra Low ENergy Antiproton decelerator) was built. It takes the antiprotons from the antiproton decelerator and cools them to 90 keV, which is &quot;cold&quot; enough to study. This machine works by using high energy and accelerating the particles within the chamber. More than one hundred antiprotons can be captured per second, a huge improvement, but it would still take several thousand years to make a nanogram of antimatter.

The biggest limiting factor in the large-scale production of antimatter is the availability of antiprotons. Recent data released by CERN states that, when fully operational, their facilities are capable of producing ten million antiprotons per minute. Assuming a 100% conversion of antiprotons to antihydrogen, it would take 100 billion years to produce 1 gram or 1 mole of antihydrogen (approximately atoms of anti-hydrogen). However, CERN only produces 1% of the anti-matter Fermilab does, and neither are designed to produce anti-matter. According to Gerald Jackson, using technology already in use today we are capable of producing and capturing 20 grams of anti-matter particles per year at a yearly cost of 670 million dollars per facility.

===Antihelium===
Antihelium-3 nuclei () were first observed in the 1970s in proton–nucleus collision experiments at the Institute for High Energy Physics by Y. Prockoshkin&#x27;s group (Protvino near Moscow, USSR) and later created in nucleus–nucleus collision experiments. Nucleus–nucleus collisions produce antinuclei through the coalescence of antiprotons and antineutrons created in these reactions. In 2011, the STAR detector reported the observation of artificially created antihelium-4 nuclei (anti-alpha particles) () from such collisions.

The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer on the International Space Station has, as of 2021, recorded eight events that seem to indicate the detection of antihelium-3.

===Preservation===
Antimatter cannot be stored in a container made of ordinary matter because antimatter reacts with any matter it touches, annihilating itself and an equal amount of the container. Antimatter in the form of charged particles can be contained by a combination of electric and magnetic fields, in a device called a Penning trap. This device cannot, however, contain antimatter that consists of uncharged particles, for which atomic traps are used. In particular, such a trap may use the dipole moment (electric or magnetic) of the trapped particles. At high vacuum, the matter or antimatter particles can be trapped and cooled with slightly off-resonant laser radiation using a magneto-optical trap or magnetic trap. Small particles can also be suspended with optical tweezers, using a highly focused laser beam.

In 2011, CERN scientists were able to preserve antihydrogen for approximately 17 minutes. The record for storing antiparticles is currently held by the TRAP experiment at CERN: antiprotons were kept in a Penning trap for 405 days. A proposal was made in 2018 to develop containment technology advanced enough to contain a billion anti-protons in a portable device to be driven to another lab for further experimentation.

===Cost===
Scientists claim that antimatter is the costliest material to make. In 2006, Gerald Smith estimated $250 million could produce 10 milligrams of positrons (equivalent to $25 billion per gram); in 1999, NASA gave a figure of $62.5 trillion per gram of antihydrogen. This is because production is difficult (only very few antiprotons are produced in reactions in particle accelerators) and because there is higher demand for other uses of particle accelerators. According to CERN, it has cost a few hundred million Swiss francs to produce about 1 billionth of a gram (the amount used so far for particle/antiparticle collisions). In comparison, to produce the first atomic weapon, the cost of the Manhattan Project was estimated at $23 billion with inflation during 2007.

Several studies funded by NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts are exploring whether it might be possible to use magnetic scoops to collect the antimatter that occurs naturally in the Van Allen belt of the Earth, and ultimately the belts of gas giants like Jupiter, ideally at a lower cost per gram.

==Uses==

===Medical===

Matter–antimatter reactions have practical applications in medical imaging, such as positron emission tomography (PET). In positive beta decay, a nuclide loses surplus positive charge by emitting a positron (in the same event, a proton becomes a neutron, and a neutrino is also emitted). Nuclides with surplus positive charge are easily made in a cyclotron and are widely generated for medical use. Antiprotons have also been shown within laboratory experiments to have the potential to treat certain cancers, in a similar method currently used for ion (proton) therapy.

===Fuel===
Isolated and stored antimatter could be used as a fuel for interplanetary or interstellar travel as part of an antimatter-catalyzed nuclear pulse propulsion or another antimatter rocket. Since the energy density of antimatter is higher than that of conventional fuels, an antimatter-fueled spacecraft would have a higher thrust-to-weight ratio than a conventional spacecraft.

If matter–antimatter collisions resulted only in photon emission, the entire rest mass of the particles would be converted to kinetic energy. The energy per unit mass () is about 10 orders of magnitude greater than chemical energies, and about 3 orders of magnitude greater than the nuclear potential energy that can be liberated, today, using nuclear fission (about per fission reaction or ), and about 2 orders of magnitude greater than the best possible results expected from fusion (about for the proton–proton chain). The reaction of of antimatter with of matter would produce (180 petajoules) of energy (by the mass–energy equivalence formula, ), or the rough equivalent of 43 megatons of TNT – slightly less than the yield of the 27,000 kg Tsar Bomba, the largest thermonuclear weapon ever detonated.

Not all of that energy can be utilized by any realistic propulsion technology because of the nature of the annihilation products. While electron–positron reactions result in gamma ray photons, these are difficult to direct and use for thrust. In reactions between protons and antiprotons, their energy is converted largely into relativistic neutral and charged pions. The neutral pions decay almost immediately (with a lifetime of 85 attoseconds) into high-energy photons, but the charged pions decay more slowly (with a lifetime of 26 nanoseconds) and can be deflected magnetically to produce thrust.

Charged pions ultimately decay into a combination of neutrinos (carrying about 22% of the energy of the charged pions) and unstable charged muons (carrying about 78% of the charged pion energy), with the muons then decaying into a combination of electrons, positrons and neutrinos (cf. muon decay; the neutrinos from this decay carry about 2/3 of the energy of the muons, meaning that from the original charged pions, the total fraction of their energy converted to neutrinos by one route or another would be about ).

===Weapons===
Antimatter has been considered as a trigger mechanism for nuclear weapons. A major obstacle is the difficulty of producing antimatter in large enough quantities, and there is no evidence that it will ever be feasible. Nonetheless, the U.S. Air Force funded studies of the physics of antimatter in the Cold War, and began considering its possible use in weapons, not just as a trigger, but as the explosive itself.

<doc id="1322" wikidata="Q461371" url="?curid=1322" title="Casa Batlló">
<text> () is a building in the center of Barcelona, Spain. It was designed by Antoni Gaudí, and is considered one of his masterpieces. A remodel of a previously built house, it was redesigned in 1904 by Gaudí (but the actual construction works hadn’t begun at this point) and has been refurbished several times since. Gaudí&#x27;s assistants Domènec Sugrañes i Gras, Josep Canaleta and Joan Rubió also contributed to the renovation project.

The local name for the building is &quot;&quot; (House of Bones), as it has a visceral, skeletal organic quality. It is located on the in the Eixample district, and forms part of a row of houses known as the (or , the &quot;Block of Discord&quot;), which consists of four buildings by noted architects of Barcelona.

Like everything Gaudí designed, is only identifiable as in the broadest sense. The ground floor, in particular, has unusual tracery, irregular oval windows and flowing sculpted stone work. There are few straight lines, and much of the façade is decorated with a colorful mosaic made of broken ceramic tiles (). The roof is arched and was likened to the back of a dragon or dinosaur. A common theory about the building is that the rounded feature to the left of centre, terminating at the top in a turret and cross, represents the lance of Saint George (patron saint of Catalonia, Gaudí&#x27;s home), which has been plunged into the back of the dragon.

In 2005, became an UNESCO World Heritage Site.

==History==
===Initial construction (1877)===

The building that is now was built in 1877, commissioned by Lluís Sala Sánchez. It was a classical building without remarkable characteristics within the eclecticism traditional by the end of the 19th century. The building had a basement, a ground floor, four other floors and a garden in the back.

===Batlló family===

The house was bought by Josep Batlló in 1903. The design of the house made the home undesirable to buyers but the Batlló family decided to buy the place due to its centralized location. It is located in the middle of , which in the early 20th century was known as a very prestigious and fashionable area. It was an area where the prestigious family could draw attention to themselves.

In 1906, Josep Batlló still owned the home. The Batlló family was very well known in Barcelona for its contribution to the textile industry in the city. Josep Batlló i Casanovas was a textile industrialist who owned a few factories in the city. Batlló married Amàlia Godó Belaunzarán, from the family that founded the newspaper &quot;La Vanguardia&quot;. Josep wanted an architect that would design a house that was like no other and stood out as being audacious and creative. Both Josep and his wife were open to anything and they decided not to limit Gaudí. Josep did not want his house to resemble any of the houses of the rest of the Batlló family, such as Casa Pía, built by the Josep Vilaseca. He chose the architect who had designed Park Güell because he wanted him to come up with a risky plan. The family lived on the principal floor of until the middle of the 1950s.

===Renovation (1904-1906)===

In 1904, Josep Batlló hired Gaudí to design his home; at first his plans were to tear down the building and construct a completely new house. Gaudí convinced Josep that a renovation was sufficient and was also able to submit the planning application the same year. The building was completed and refurbished in 1906. He completely changed the main apartment which became the residence for the Batlló family. He expanded the central well in order to supply light to the whole building and also added new floors. In the same year the Barcelona City Council selected the house as a candidate for that year&#x27;s best building award. The award was given to another architect that year despite Gaudí&#x27;s design.

===Refurbishments===
Josep Batlló died in 1934 and the house was kept in order by the wife until her death in 1940. After the death of the two parents, the house was kept and managed by the children until 1954. In 1954, an insurance company named Seguros Iberia acquired Casa Batlló and set up offices there. In 1970, the first refurbishment occurred mainly in several of the interior rooms of the house. In 1983, the exterior balconies were restored to their original colour and a year later the exterior façade was illuminated in the ceremony of La Mercè.

===Multiple uses===
In 1993, the current owners of Casa Batlló bought the home and continued refurbishments throughout the whole building. Two years later, in 1995, Casa Batlló began to hire out its facilities for different events. More than 2,500 square meters of rooms within the building were rented out for many different functions. Due to the building&#x27;s location and the beauty of the facilities being rented, the rooms of Casa Batlló were in very high demand and hosted many important events for the city.

==Design==
===Overview===
The local name for the building is &quot;Casa dels ossos&quot; (House of Bones), as it has a visceral, skeletal organic quality. The building looks very remarkable — like everything Gaudí designed, only identifiable as Modernisme or Art Nouveau in the broadest sense. The ground floor, in particular, is rather astonishing with tracery, irregular oval windows and flowing sculpted stone work.

It seems that the goal of the designer was to avoid straight lines completely. Much of the façade is decorated with a mosaic made of broken ceramic tiles (trencadís) that starts in shades of golden orange moving into greenish blues. The roof is arched and was likened to the back of a dragon or dinosaur. A common theory about the building is that the rounded feature to the left of centre, terminating at the top in a turret and cross, represents the lance of Saint George (patron saint of Catalonia, Gaudí&#x27;s home), which has been plunged into the back of the dragon.

===Loft===
The loft is considered to be one of the most unusual spaces. It was formerly a service area for the tenants of the different apartments in the building which contained laundry rooms and storage areas. It is known for its simplicity of shapes and its Mediterranean influence through the use of white on the walls. It contains a series of sixty catenary arches that creates a space which represents the ribcage of an animal. Some people believe that the “ribcage” design of the arches is a ribcage for the dragon&#x27;s spine that is represented in the roof.

=== The Atrium (light well) ===

The Atrium or the light well is in the central part of the house and delivers air and lighting to all corners of the house. Gaudí had an obsession with light and how it reflected off certain surfaces. The wall of the atrium has different tones of blue as well as a diamond textile pattern all around the walls. The blue tiles allow an equal distribution of light to all the floors. The well has windows with wooden splits to allow them to be open and closed for ventilation. Gaudí wanted to make the bottom of the well feel like the bottom of the sea. The skylight allows light to come in and reflect off the ceramic tiles into the windows to naturally illuminate the house. The blue tiles are more intensely colored at the top and get opaquer towards the bottom. The diamond textiles match the rest of the house&#x27;s use of different, functional shapes. 

===Noble floor and museum===

The noble floor is larger than seven-hundred square meters. It is the main floor of the building. The noble floor is accessed through a private entrance hall that uses skylights resembling tortoise shells and vaulted walls in curving shapes. On the noble floor there is a spacious landing with direct views of the blue tiling of the building well. On the Passeig de Gracia side is Batlló&#x27;s study, a dining room, and a secluded spot for courting couples, decorated with a mushroom-shaped fireplace. The elaborate and animal-like décor continues throughout the whole noble floor.

In 2002, as part of the celebration of the International Year of Gaudí, the house opened its doors to the public and people were allowed to visit the noble floor. Casa Batlló met with great unanticipated success, and visitors became eager to see the rest of the house. Two years later, in celebration of the one hundredth anniversary of the beginning of work on Casa Batlló, the fifth floor was restored and the house extended its visit to the loft and the well. In 2005, Casa Batlló became a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

===Roof===

The roof terrace is one of the most popular features of the entire house due to its famous dragon back design. Gaudí represents an animal&#x27;s spine by using tiles of different colors on one side. The roof is decorated with four chimney stacks designed to prevent backdraughts.

===Exterior façade===

The façade has three distinct sections which are harmoniously integrated. The lower ground floor with the main floor and two first-floor galleries are contained in a structure of Montjuïc sandstone with undulating lines. The central part, which reaches the last floor, is a multicolored section with protruding balconies. The top of the building is a crown, like a huge gable, which is at the same level as the roof and helps to conceal the room where there used to be water tanks. This room is currently empty. The top displays a trim with ceramic pieces that has attracted multiple interpretations.

====Roof tile====

The roof&#x27;s arched profile recalls the spine of a dragon with ceramic tiles for scales, and a small triangular window towards the right of the structure simulates the eye. Legend has it that it was once possible to see the Sagrada Família through this window, which was being built simultaneously. As of 2022, the partial view of the Sagrada Família is available from this vantage point, with its spires visible over newer buildings. The tiles were given a metallic sheen to simulate the varying scales of the monster, with the color grading from green on the right side, where the head begins, to deep blue and violet in the center, to red and pink on the left side of the building.

====Tower and bulb====
One of the highlights of the façade is a tower topped with a cross of four arms oriented to the cardinal directions. It is a bulbous, root-like structure that evokes plant life. There is a second bulb-shaped structure similarly reminiscent of a thalamus flower, which is represented by a cross with arms that are actually buds announcing the next flowering. The tower is decorated with monograms of Jesus (JHS), Maria (M with the ducal crown) and Joseph (JHP), made of ceramic pieces that stand out golden on the green background that covers the façade. These symbols show the deep religiosity of Gaudí, who was inspired by the contemporaneous construction of his basilica to choose the theme of the holy family.

The bulb was broken when it was delivered, perhaps during transportation. Although the manufacturer committed to re-do the broken parts, Gaudí liked the aesthetic of the broken masonry and asked that the pieces be stuck to the main structure with lime mortar and held in with a brass ring.

====Central section====

The central part of the façade evokes the surface of a lake with water lilies, reminiscent of Monet&#x27;s &quot;Nymphéas&quot;, with gentle ripples and reflections caused by the glass and ceramic mosaic. It is a great undulating surface covered with plaster fragments of colored glass discs combined with 330 rounds of polychrome pottery. The discs were designed by Gaudí and Jujol between tests during their stay in Majorca, while working on the restoration of the Cathedral of Palma.

====Balcony====
Finally, above the central part of the façade is a smaller balcony, also iron, with a different exterior aesthetic, closer to a local type of lily. Two iron arms were installed here to support a pulley to raise and lower furniture.

====Main floor====
The façade of the main floor, made entirely in sandstone, and is supported by two columns. The design is complemented by joinery windows set with multicolored stained glass. In front of the large windows, as if they were pillars that support the complex stone structure, there are six fine columns that seem to simulate the bones of a limb, with an apparent central articulation; in fact, this is a floral decoration. The rounded shapes of the gaps and the lip-like edges carved into the stone surrounding them create a semblance of a fully open mouth, for which the Casa Batlló has been nicknamed the &quot;house of yawns&quot;. The structure repeats on the first floor and in the design of two windows at the ends forming galleries, but on the large central window there are two balconies as described above.

<doc id="1324" wikidata="Q212867" url="?curid=1324" title="Park Güell">
<text>Park Güell ( ; ) is a privatized complex of parks, gardens and architectural elements in the Gràcia district of Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. The site is located in the La Salut neighborhood on the southern side of a hill known as the Turó del Carmel, part of the Collserola mountain range. The separate Parc del Carmel is located on the northern side of the hill.

In the midst of Barcelona&#x27;s late 19th and early 20th century urban expansion, Eusebi Güell, the Catalan industrialist and art patron, sought to commission a new park. Güell commissioned the design of the park to the renowned architect, Antoni Gaudí, widely regarded as a central figure of the aesthetic movement of Catalan modernism.

Park Güell was built between 1900 and 1914 and was officially opened to the public in 1926. In 1984, UNESCO declared the park a World Heritage Site, recognizing it as part of the &quot;Works of Antoni Gaudí&quot; architectural series.

==Description==

In addition to reflecting the distinct aesthetic sensibilities, artistic influences, and visual language present throughout Gaudí&#x27;s career, Park Güell captures a particular moment in his artistic evolution. The park is associated with his naturalist phase, which occurred in the first decade of the 20th century. During this period, Gaudí&#x27;s study of nature and organic shapes began to influence him creatively. Reflecting this shift, Gaudí introduced a series of new structural solutions rooted in geometric analysis. 

Gaudí expanded upon these geometric forms to create his characteristically imaginative, ornamental style. Rooted in the Baroque, his works are characterized by a structural richness of forms and volumes, free of the rational rigidity of classical conventions. In designing Park Güell, Gaudí put these structural innovations into practice. Gaudí would further elaborate on this characteristic style in the creation of the enormous Sagrada Família (Basilica and Expiatory Church of the Holy Family).

Güell and Gaudí originally conceived the space not as a public park, but as a private community of luxurious homes equipped with all the latest modern amenities to fulfill the needs of its residents both artistically and physically. They envisioned a community strongly influenced by symbolism and Park Güell&#x27;s common spaces (stairways, plazas, terraces, gardens) are designed to express physically the political and religious ideals of both patron and architect. For example, there are noticeable concepts originating from political Catalanism, most notably in the entrance stairway where the Catalan countries are represented, and Catholicism, as Monumento al Calvario, originally designed to be a chapel. In addition to Gaudí&#x27;s reinterpretation of classical architectural elements such as columns, colonnades, and porticos, Park Güell also contains numerous references to Greek Mythology. Some have suggested that Güell and Gaudí&#x27;s conception of the park was inspired by the Temple of Apollo of Delphi.

The meaning of these symbols continues to be the subject of speculation. To some, Park Güell represents a spatial nexus of complex iconography that Gaudí intentionally applied to the project. Interpretations range from expressions of political vindication to religious exaltation, laden with mythologic, historical, and philosophical references. Others claim that Park Güell displays masonic influences in spite of the fact that both Güell and Gaudí embraced traditional Catholicism. 
==Origins as a housing development==

The park was originally part of a commercially unsuccessful housing development by Count Eusebi Güell. It was inspired by the English garden city movement, hence the use of the English word &quot;Park&quot; (Catalan: &quot;Parc Güell&quot;, Spanish: &quot;Parque Güell&quot;) in the original name. The site chosen was a rocky hill with little vegetation and few trees, called &quot;Muntanya Pelada&quot; (English: Bare Mountain). Already present on the property was a large country house called Larrard House or Muntaner de Dalt House. The site was adjacent to an upper-class neighborhood called &quot;La Salut&quot; (The Health). Güell intended to take advantage of the site&#x27;s the fresh air (away from smoky factories) and vistas. The original development planned to divide the site into sixty triangular lots for luxury houses. To provide publicity for the new development, Güell would move into Larrard House in 1906. Ultimately, only two houses were built, neither of which were designed by Gaudí. 

One of these houses was built as a display home, but upon completion was put up for sale in 1904. However, because no buyers came forward, Güell suggested that Gaudí purchase the home with his own savings. Gaudí agreed and moved in with his family and his father in 1906. This house, in which Gaudí lived from 1906 until his death in 1926, was built in 1904 by Francesc Berenguer, himself a modernist architect and associate of Gaudí&#x27;s. It contains original works by Gaudí and several of his collaborators. Since 1963, it has been open to the public as the Gaudí House Museum (Catalan: &quot;Casa Museu Gaudí&quot;). In 1969, it was declared to be a historical artistic monument of national interest.

== Municipal garden ==

Parc Güell has since been converted into a municipal garden. It is accessible by metro, although the closet metro stations (Vallcarca and Lesseps) are located some distance from the site at the base of Turó de Carmel. It can also be reached by city buses or commercial tourist buses. In October 2013, an entrance fee was introduced for the Monumental Zone (main entrance, terrace, viaducts, and areas featuring mosaics), though citizens of Barcelona may enter free of charge. Limited tickets are available, though these often sell out in advance. La Torre Rosa, Gaudí&#x27;s home converted into a museum featuring furniture that he designed, can be visited for another entrance fee. However, there is a reduced rate for those wishing to see both Gaudí&#x27;s house and the Sagrada Família Church.

The entrance is flanked by two gatehouses, both of which were designed by Gaudí. These two buildings make up the Porter&#x27;s Lodge pavilion. One of these buildings contains a small room with a telephone booth. The other, while once being the porter&#x27;s house, is now a permanent exhibition of the Barcelona City History Museum (Catalan: &quot;Museu d&#x27;Història de Barcelona&quot;)&quot;.&quot;

The focal point of the park is the main terrace, enclosed by a long bench in the form of a sea serpent. The curves of the serpent bench from a number of enclaves, designed to foster social interaction. The design of the benches was the work not of Gaudí, but of his often overlooked collaborator Josep Maria Jujol.

Another prominent feature found throughout the park are the series of elevated pathways, originally intended to service the houses, designed by Gaudí to jut out from the steep hillside or rest on viaducts. These structures often serve as the roofs for lower footpaths in arcades formed underneath. To further minimize the intrusion of these roads, Gaudí had them constructed using a local stone, rendering them as an extension of landscape. Echoing natural forms, the columns and branching vaults supporting the roadways were carved to resemble tree trunks. Similar to his previous work on the Church of Colònia Güell, Gaudí used curved vaulting and the alignment of sloping columns to form inverted catenary arch shapes, which function as ideal compression structures.

At the park&#x27;s high point, there is a stone hill composed of steps leading up to a platform on which stands three large crosses. This is Calvary, officially named El Turó de les Tres Creus. Two of the crosses point north–south and east–west, while the third and tallest cross points skyward. From this vantage it is possible to view the main city in panorama, including the Sagrada Família, Agbar Tower, and Montjuïc area in the distance.

Park Güell supports a wide variety of wildlife, notably several of Barcelona&#x27;s non-native parrots in addition to sightings of the short-toed eagle. The park also supports a population of hummingbird hawk moths.

<doc id="1325" wikidata="Q207870" url="?curid=1325" title="Casa Milà">
<text>Casa Milà (, ), popularly known as &quot;La Pedrera&quot; (, ; &quot;the stone quarry&quot;) in reference to its unconventional rough-hewn appearance, is a &quot;Modernista&quot; building in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. It was the last private residence designed by architect Antoni Gaudí and was built between 1906 and 1912.

The building was commissioned in 1906 by and his wife . At the time, it was controversial because of its undulating stone facade, twisting wrought iron balconies, and design by Josep Maria Jujol. Several structural innovations include a self-supporting stone façade, and a free-plan floor, underground garage and the spectacular terrace on the roof.

In 1984, it was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Since 2013 it has been the headquarters of the Fundació Catalunya La Pedrera, which manages visits to the building, exhibitions and other cultural and educational activities at Casa Milà.

== Building history ==

=== Architect ===
Antoni Gaudí i Cornet was born on June 25, 1852, in Catalonia, Spain. As a child, Gaudí&#x27;s health was poor, suffering from rheumatism. Because of this, he was afforded lengthy periods of time resting at his summer house in Riudoms. Here he spent a large portion of his time outdoors, allowing him to deeply study nature. This would become one of the major influences in his architecture to come.

Gaudí was a very practical man and a craftsman at his core. In his work he followed impulses and turned creative plans into reality. His openness to embrace new styles combined with a vivid imagination helped mold new styles of architecture and consequently helped push the limits of construction. Today he is regarded as a pioneer of the modern architecture style.

In 1870, Gaudí moved to Barcelona to study architecture. He was an inconsistent student who showed flashes of brilliance. It took him eight years to graduate due to a mix of health complications, military service as well as other activities.

After completion of his education he became a prolific architect as well as designing gardens, sculptures and all other decorative arts. Gaudí&#x27;s most famous works consisted of several buildings: Parque Güell; Palacio Güell; Casa Mila; Casa Vicens. He also is attributed for his work on the Crypt of La Sagrada Familia and the Nativity facade. Gaudí&#x27;s work at the time was both admired and criticized for his bold, innovative solutions.

Gaudí was injured on June 7, 1926, when he was run over by a tram. He later died in the hospital due to his injuries on June 10, 1926, at the age of 73. A few years after his death, his fame became renowned by critics and the general public alike.

===Building owners===

Casa Milà was built for Roser Segimón and her husband Pere Milà. Roser Segimón was the wealthy widow of Josep Guardiola, an &quot;Indiano&quot; or &quot;Americano&quot;, or former colonist returned from the Americas, who had made his fortune with a coffee plantation in Guatemala. Her second husband, Pere Milà, was a developer known for his flamboyant lifestyle.

===Construction process===

In 1905, Milà and Segimón married and on June 9, Roser Segimón bought a house with garden which occupied an area of 1,835 square meters, located on Paseo de Gracia, 92. In September, they commissioned Gaudí for building them a new house with the idea of living in the main floor and renting out the rest of the apartments. On February 2, 1906, the project was presented to the Barcelona City Council and the works began, demolishing the pre-existing building instead of reforming it, as in the case of the Casa Batlló.

The building was completed in December 1910 and the owner asked Gaudí to make a certificate to inhabit the main floor, which the City Council authorized in October 1911, and the couple moved in. On October 31, 1912, Gaudí issued the certificate stating that, in accordance with his plans and his direction, the work had been completed and the whole house was ready to be rented.

=== Critics and controversies ===
The building did not respect any rules of conventional style, for which Gaudí received much criticism. To begin with, the name &quot;La Pedrera&quot; is in fact a nickname assigned by the citizens who disapproved of its unusualness. The unique structure of the building and the relationship between the building&#x27;s architect and Pere Milà became the object of ridicule for the people of Barcelona and many humorous publications of the time.

==== Catholic symbols ====

Gaudí, a Catholic and a devotee of the Virgin Mary, planned for the Casa Milà to be a spiritual symbol. Overt religious elements include an excerpt from the Rosary on the cornice and planned statues of Mary, specifically Our Lady of the Rosary, and two archangels, St. Michael and St. Gabriel.

However, the Casa Milà was not built entirely to Gaudí&#x27;s specifications. The local government ordered the demolition of elements that exceeded the height standard for the city, and fined the Milàs for many infractions of building codes. After Semana Trágica, an outbreak of anticlericalism in the city, Milà prudently decided to forgo the religious statues. Gaudí contemplated abandoning the project but a priest persuaded him to continue.

=== Change of ownership ===

In 1940, Milà died. Segimon sold the property in 1946 for 18 million pesetas to Josep Ballvé i Pellisé, known for his department stores on , in partnership with the family of Pío Rubert Laporta. The Compañía Inmobiliaria Provenza, SA (CIPSA) was founded to administer the building. Roser Segimon continued to live on the main floor until her death in 1964.
The new owners divided the first floor facing into five apartments instead of the original two. In 1953, they commissioned to convert 13 rubbish-filled attic laundry rooms to street-facing apartments, leaving a communal hallway on the side facing the courtyards. Some of these two or three room apartments had a loft and were designed and furnished in a typical early 1950s style using brick, ceramic and wood. Items of furniture, such as the , were reminiscent of Eero Saarinen&#x27;s work.

The insurance company Northern took over the main floor in 1966. By then, Casa Milà had housed a bingo hall, an academy and the offices of Cementos Molins and Inoxcrom among others. Maintenance costs were high and the owners had allowed the building to become dilapidated, causing stones to loosen in 1971. Josep Anton Comas made some emergency repairs, especially to the paintings in the courtyards, while respecting the original design.

=== Restoration ===

Gaudí&#x27;s work was designated a historic and artistic monument on July 24, 1969. Casa Milà was in poor condition in the early 1980s. It had been painted a dreary brown and many of its interior color schemes had been abandoned or allowed to deteriorate, but it has been restored since including restoring many of the original colors.

In 1984, the building became part of a World Heritage Site encompassing some of Gaudí&#x27;s works. The Barcelonan city council tried to rent the main floor as an office for the 1992 Olympic bid. Finally, the day before Christmas 1986, Caixa Catalunya bought La Pedrera for 900 million pesetas. On February 19, 1987, urgently needed work began on the restoration and cleaning of the façade. The work was done by the architects Joseph Emilio Hernández-Cros and Rafael Vila. The renovated main floor opened in 1990 as part of the Cultural Olympiad of Barcelona. The floor became an exhibition room with an example of modernism in the Eixample.

== Design ==
The building is 1,323 m2 per floor on a plot of 1,620 m2. Gaudí made the first sketches in his workshop in the Sagrada Família. He designed the house as a constant curve, both outside and inside, incorporating ruled geometry and naturalistic elements.
Casa Milà consists of two buildings, which are structured around two courtyards that provide light to the nine stories: basement, ground floor, mezzanine, main (or noble) floor, four upper floors, and an attic. The basement was intended to be the garage, the main floor the residence of the Milàs (a flat of all 1,323 m2), and the rest distributed over 20 apartments. The resulting layout is shaped like an asymmetrical &quot;8&quot; because of the different shapes and sizes of the courtyards. The attic housed the laundry and drying areas, forming an insulating space for the building and simultaneously determining the levels of the roof.

One of the most notable elements of the building is the roof, crowned with skylights, staircase exits, fans, and chimneys. All of these elements, constructed out of brick covered with lime, broken marble, or glass have a specific architectural function but are also real sculptures integrated into the building.

The apartments feature plastered ceilings with dynamic reliefs, handcrafted wooden doors, windows, and furniture, as well as hydraulic tiles and various ornamental elements.

The stairways were intended as service entries, with the main access to the apartments by elevator except for the noble floor, where Gaudí added a prominent interior staircase. Gaudí wanted the people who lived in the flats to all know each other. Therefore, there were only elevators on every other floor, so people on different floors would meet one another.

=== Structure ===

Casa Milà is characterized by its self-supporting stone facade, meaning that it is free of load-bearing walls. The facade connects to the internal structure of each floor by means of curved iron beams surrounding the perimeter of each floor. This construction system allows, on one hand, large openings in the facade which give light to the homes, and on the other, free structuring of the different levels, so that internal walls can be added and demolished without affecting the stability of the building. This allows the owners to change their minds at will and to modify, without problems, the interior layout of the homes.

=== Constructive and decorative items ===
==== Facade ====
The facade is composed of large blocks of limestone from the Garraf Massif on the first floor and from the Villefranche quarry for the higher levels. The blocks were cut to follow the plot of the projection of the model, then raised to their location and adjusted to align in a continuous curve to the pieces around them.

The windows of La Pedrera are an integral part of the overall facade design. Gaudí made sure that the windows were of varying sizes, designed to optimize the amount of natural light that could enter the building.

Viewed from the outside the building has three parts: the main body of the six-storey blocks with winding stone floors, two floors set a block back with a different curve, similar to waves, a smoother texture and whiter color, and with small holes that look like embrasures, and finally the body of the roof.

Gaudí&#x27;s original facade had some of its lower-level ironwork removed. In 1928, the tailor Mosella opened the first store in La Pedrera, and he eliminated the bars. This did not concern anyone, because in the middle of twentieth century, wrought ironwork had little importance. The ironwork was lost until a few years later, when Americans donated one of them to the MoMa, where it is on display.

With restoration initiatives launched in 1987, the facade was rejoined to some pieces of stone that had fallen. In order to respect the fidelity of the original, material was obtained from the Villefranche quarry, even though by then it was no longer operating.

==== Hall and courtyards ====
The building uses a completely original solution to solve the issue of a lobby being too closed and dark. Its open and airy courtyards provide a place of transit and are directly visible to those accessing the building. There are two patios on the side of the Passeig de Gracia and of the street Provence.

;Patios

Patios, structurally, are key as supporting loads of interior facades. The floor of the courtyard is supported by pillars of cast iron. In the courtyard, there are traditional elliptical beams and girders but Gaudí applied an ingenious solution of using two concentric cylindrical beams with stretched radial beams, like the spokes of a bicycle. They form a point outside of the beam to two points above and below, making the function of the central girder a keystone and working in tension and compression simultaneously. This supported structure is twelve feet in diameter and is considered &quot;the soul of the building&quot; with a clear resemblance to Gothic crypts. The centerpiece was built in a shipyard by Josep Maria Carandell who copied a steering wheel, interpreting Gaudí&#x27;s intent as to represent the helm of the ship of life.

;Interior, gates

Access is protected by a massive iron gate with a design attributed to Jujol. It was originally used by both people and cars, as access to the garage is in the basement, now an auditorium.

The two halls are fully polychrome with oil paintings on the plaster surfaces, with eclectic references to mythology and flowers.

During construction there was a problem including a basement as a garage for cars, the new invention that was thrilling the bourgeois at the time. The future neighbor Felix Anthony Meadows, owner of Industrial Linera, requested a change because his Rolls-Royce could not access it. Gaudí agreed to remove a pillar on the ramp that led into the garage so that Felix, who was establishing sales and factory in Parets del Vallès, could go to both places with his car from La Pedrera.

For the floors of Casa Milà, Gaudí used a model of floor forms of square timbers with two colors, and the hydraulic pavement hexagonal pieces of blue and sea motifs that had originally been designed for the Batllo house. The wax was designed in gray by John Bertrand under the supervision of Gaudí who &quot;touched up with their own fingers,&quot; in the words of the manufacturer Josep Bay.

==== Loft ====

Like in Casa Batlló, Gaudí shows the application of the catenary arch as a support structure for the roof, a form which he had already used shortly after graduating in the wood frameworks of Mataró&#x27;s cooperative known as &quot;L&#x27;Obrera Mataronense.&quot; In this case, Gaudí used the Catalan technique of timbrel, imported from Italy in the fourteenth century.

The attic, where the laundry rooms were located, was a clear room under a Catalan vault roof supported by 270 parabolic vaults of different heights and spaced by about 80 cm. The roof resembles both the ribs of a huge animal and a palm, giving the roof-deck a very unconventional shape similar to a landscape of hills and valleys. The shape and location of the courtyards makes the arches higher when the space is narrowed and lower when the space expands.

The builder Bayó explained its construction: &quot;First the face of a wide wall was filled with mortar and plastered. Then Canaleta indicated the opening of each arch and Bayó put a nail at each starting point of the arch at the top of the wall. From these nails was dangled a chain so that the lowest point coincided with the deflection of the arch. Then the profile displayed on the wall by the chain was drawn and on this profile the carpenter marked and placed the corresponding centering, and the timbrel vault was started with three rows of plane bricks. Gaudí wanted to add a longitudinal axis of bricks connecting all vaults at their keystones&quot;.

==== Roof and chimneys ====

The work of Gaudí on the rooftop of La Pedrera brought his experience at Palau Güell together with solutions that were clearly more innovative – this time creating shapes and volumes with more body, more prominence, and less polychromasia.

On the rooftop there are six skylights/staircase exits (four of which were covered with broken pottery and some that ended in a double cross typical of Gaudí), twenty-eight chimneys in several groupings, two half-hidden vents whose function is to renew the air in the building, and four domes that discharged to the facade. The staircases also house the water tanks; some of which are snail-shaped.

The stepped roof of La Pedrera, called &quot;the garden of warriors&quot; by the poet Pere Gimferrer because the chimneys appear to be protecting the skylights, has undergone a radical restoration, removing chimneys added in interventions after Gaudí, television antennas, and other elements that degraded the space. The restoration brought back the splendor to the chimneys and the skylights that were covered with fragments of marble and broken Valencia tiles. One of the chimneys was topped with glass pieces – it was said that Gaudí did that the day after the inauguration of the building, taking advantage of the empty bottles from the party. It was restored with the bases of champagne bottles from the early twentieth century. The repair work has enabled the restoration of the original impact of the overhangs made of stone from Ulldecona with fragments of tiles. This whole set is more colorful than the facade, although here the creamy tones are dominant.

==== Furniture ====
Gaudí, as he had done in Casa Batlló, designed furniture specifically for the main floor. This was part of the concept artwork itself integral to modernism in which the architect assumed responsibility for global issues such as the structure and the facade, as well as every detail of the decor, designing furniture and accessories such as lamps, planters, floors or ceilings.

This was another point of friction with Segimon, who complained that there was no straight wall to place her Steinway piano. Gaudí&#x27;s response was blunt: &quot;So play the violin.&quot; The result of these disagreements has been the loss of the decorative legacy of Gaudí, as most of the furniture was removed due to climate change and the changes she made to the main floor when Gaudí died. Some remain in private collections, including a curtain made of oak 4 m. long by 1.96 m. high in the Museum of Catalan Modernism; and a chair and desktop of Milà.

Gaudí carved oak doors similar to what he had done for the Casa y Bardes, but these were only included on two floors as when Segimon discovered the price, she decided there would be no more at that quality.

== Architecture ==

&quot;Casa Milà&quot; is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site &quot;Works of Antoni Gaudí&quot;. It was a predecessor of some buildings with a similar biomorphic appearance:
* the 1921 Einstein Tower in Potsdam, designed by Erich Mendelsohn
* Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan, New York, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright
* Chapelle Notre Dame du Haut, Ronchamp, France, designed by Le Corbusier
* the Hundertwasserhaus and other works by Austrian architect Friedensreich Hundertwasser
* Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, by Frank Gehry

Free exhibitions often are held on the first floor, which also provides some opportunity to see the interior design. There is a charge for entrance to the apartment on the fourth floor and the roof. The other floors are not open to visitors.

=== Constructive similarities ===
Gaudí&#x27;s La Pedrera was inspired by a mountain, but there is no agreement as to which mountain was the reference model. Joan Bergós thought it was the rocks of Fray Guerau in Prades mountains. Joan Matamala thought that the model could have been St. Miquel del Fai, while the sculptor Vicente Vilarubias believed it was inspired by the cliffs Torrent Pareis in Menorca. Other options include the mountains of Uçhisar in Cappadocia, suggested by Juan Goytisolo, or Mola Gallifa, suggested by Louis Permanyer, based on the fact that Gaudí visited the area in 1885 to escape an outbreak of cholera in Barcelona.

Some people say that the interior layout of La Pedrera comes from studies that Gaudí made of medieval fortresses. This image is reinforced by the seeming appearance of the rooftop chimneys as &quot;sentinels&quot; with great helmets. The structure of the iron door in the lobby does not follow any symmetry, straight or repetitive pattern. Rather, it evokes bubbles of soap that are formed between the hands or the structures of a plant cell.

== Criticism and controversy ==

The building&#x27;s unconventional style made it the subject of much criticism. It was given the nickname &quot;La Pedrera&quot;, meaning &quot;the quarry&quot;. Casa Milà appeared in many satirical magazines. Joan Junceda presented it as a traditional &quot;Easter cake&quot; by means of cartoons in &quot;Patufet&quot;. Joaquim Garcia made a joke about the difficulty of setting the damask wrought iron balconies in his magazine. Homeowners in Passeig de Gracia became angry with Milà and ceased to greet him, arguing that the weird building by Gaudí would lower the price of land in the area.

===Administrative problems===
Casa Milà also caused some administrative problems. In December 1907 the City Hall stopped work on the building because of a pillar which occupied part of the sidewalk, not respecting the alignment of facades. Again on August 17, 1908, more problems occurred when the building surpassed the predicted height and borders of its construction site by . The Council called for a fine of 100,000 pesetas (approximately 25% of the cost of work) or for the demolition of the attic and roof. The dispute was resolved a year and a half later, December 28, 1909, when the Commission certified that it was a monumental building and thus not required to have a &#x27;strict compliance&#x27; with the bylaws.

===Design competitions===
The owner entered La Pedrera in the annual sponsored by the Barcelona City Council (&quot;Ayuntament&quot;). Other entries in the competition included two works by Sagnier (Calle Mallorca 264, and one on Corsica and Av. Diagonal), the by architect , and the , designed by . Although the most dramatic and clear favorite was Casa Milà, the jury opined that even though the facades were complete, &quot;there&#x27;s still a lot left to do before it&#x27;s fully completed, finalized and in a perfect state of appreciation.&quot; The winner in 1910 was Samanillo Perez, for his building which now houses the headquarters of the Circulo Ecuestre.

===Design disagreements===
Gaudí&#x27;s relations with Segimon deteriorated during the construction and decoration of the house. There were many disagreements between them, one example being the monumental bronze virgin del Rosario, which Gaudí wanted as the statue on the front of the building in homage to the name of the owner, that the artist Carles Mani i Roig was to sculpt. The statue was not made although the words &quot;Ave gratia M plena Dominus tecum&quot; were written at the top of the facade. Continuing disagreements led Gaudí to take Milà to court over his fees. The lawsuit was won by Gaudí in 1916, and he gave the 105,000 pesetas he won in the case to charity, stating that &quot;the principles mattered more than money.&quot; Milà was having to pay the mortgage.

After Gaudí&#x27;s death in 1926, Segimon got rid of most of the furniture that Gaudí had designed and covered over parts of Gaudí&#x27;s designs with new decorations in the style of Louis XVI. La Pedrera was acquired in 1986 by and when restoration was done four years later, some of the original decorations re-emerged.

When the Civil War broke out in July 1936, the Milàs were on vacation. Part of the building was collectivized by the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia; the Milàs fled the area with some artwork.

* Mentioned in the book by Trudi Alexy &quot;The Mezuzah in the Madonna&#x27;s Foot&quot;
* Mentioned in the &#x27;Ballrooms and Biscotti&#x27; episode (season 4, episode 1) of &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;
* Several scenes in the film, &quot;Gaudi Afternoon&quot;

<text>In particle physics, every type of particle of &quot;ordinary&quot; matter (as opposed to antimatter) is associated with an antiparticle with the same mass but with opposite physical charges (such as electric charge). For example, the antiparticle of the electron is the positron (also known as an antielectron). While the electron has a negative electric charge, the positron has a positive electric charge, and is produced naturally in certain types of radioactive decay. The opposite is also true: the antiparticle of the positron is the electron.

Some particles, such as the photon, are their own antiparticle. Otherwise, for each pair of antiparticle partners, one is designated as the normal particle (the one that occurs in matter usually interacted with in daily life). The other (usually given the prefix &quot;anti-&quot;) is designated the &quot;antiparticle&quot;.

Particle–antiparticle pairs can annihilate each other, producing photons; since the charges of the particle and antiparticle are opposite, total charge is conserved. For example, the positrons produced in natural radioactive decay quickly annihilate themselves with electrons, producing pairs of gamma rays, a process exploited in positron emission tomography.

The laws of nature are very nearly symmetrical with respect to particles and antiparticles. For example, an antiproton and a positron can form an antihydrogen atom, which is believed to have the same properties as a hydrogen atom. This leads to the question of why the formation of matter after the Big Bang resulted in a universe consisting almost entirely of matter, rather than being a half-and-half mixture of matter and antimatter. The discovery of charge parity violation helped to shed light on this problem by showing that this symmetry, originally thought to be perfect, was only approximate. The question about how the formation of matter after the Big Bang resulted in a universe consisting almost entirely of matter remains an unanswered one, and explanations so far are not truly satisfactory, overall. 

Because charge is conserved, it is not possible to create an antiparticle without either destroying another particle of the same charge (as is for instance the case when antiparticles are produced naturally via beta decay or the collision of cosmic rays with Earth&#x27;s atmosphere), or by the simultaneous creation of both a particle &quot;and&quot; its antiparticle (pair production), which can occur in particle accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.

Particles and their antiparticles have equal and opposite charges, so that an uncharged particle also gives rise to an uncharged antiparticle. In many cases, the antiparticle and the particle coincide: pairs of photons, Z0 bosons,  mesons, and hypothetical gravitons and some hypothetical WIMPs all self-annihilate. However, electrically neutral particles need not be identical to their antiparticles: for example, the neutron and antineutron are distinct.

== History ==

=== Experiment ===

In 1932, soon after the prediction of positrons by Paul Dirac, Carl D. Anderson found that cosmic-ray collisions produced these particles in a cloud chamber – a particle detector in which moving electrons (or positrons) leave behind trails as they move through the gas. The electric charge-to-mass ratio of a particle can be measured by observing the radius of curling of its cloud-chamber track in a magnetic field. Positrons, because of the direction that their paths curled, were at first mistaken for electrons travelling in the opposite direction. Positron paths in a cloud-chamber trace the same helical path as an electron but rotate in the opposite direction with respect to the magnetic field direction due to their having the same magnitude of charge-to-mass ratio but with opposite charge and, therefore, opposite signed charge-to-mass ratios.

The antiproton and antineutron were found by Emilio Segrè and Owen Chamberlain in 1955 at the University of California, Berkeley. Since then, the antiparticles of many other subatomic particles have been created in particle accelerator experiments. In recent years, complete atoms of antimatter have been assembled out of antiprotons and positrons, collected in electromagnetic traps.

=== Dirac hole theory ===

Solutions of the Dirac equation contain negative energy quantum states. As a result, an electron could always radiate energy and fall into a negative energy state. Even worse, it could keep radiating infinite amounts of energy because there were infinitely many negative energy states available. To prevent this unphysical situation from happening, Dirac proposed that a &quot;sea&quot; of negative-energy electrons fills the universe, already occupying all of the lower-energy states so that, due to the Pauli exclusion principle, no other electron could fall into them. Sometimes, however, one of these negative-energy particles could be lifted out of this Dirac sea to become a positive-energy particle. But, when lifted out, it would leave behind a &quot;hole&quot; in the sea that would act exactly like a positive-energy electron with a reversed charge. These holes were interpreted as &quot;negative-energy electrons&quot; by Paul Dirac and mistakenly identified with protons in his 1930 paper &quot;A Theory of Electrons and Protons&quot; However, these &quot;negative-energy electrons&quot; turned out to be positrons, and not protons.

This picture implied an infinite negative charge for the universea problem of which Dirac was aware. Dirac tried to argue that we would perceive this as the normal state of zero charge. Another difficulty was the difference in masses of the electron and the proton. Dirac tried to argue that this was due to the electromagnetic interactions with the sea, until Hermann Weyl proved that hole theory was completely symmetric between negative and positive charges. Dirac also predicted a reaction  +  →  + , where an electron and a proton annihilate to give two photons. Robert Oppenheimer and Igor Tamm, however, proved that this would cause ordinary matter to disappear too fast. A year later, in 1931, Dirac modified his theory and postulated the positron, a new particle of the same mass as the electron. The discovery of this particle the next year removed the last two objections to his theory.

Within Dirac&#x27;s theory, the problem of infinite charge of the universe remains. Some bosons also have antiparticles, but since bosons do not obey the Pauli exclusion principle (only fermions do), hole theory does not work for them. A unified interpretation of antiparticles is now available in quantum field theory, which solves both these problems by describing antimatter as negative energy states of the same underlying matter field, i.e. particles moving backwards in time.

== Elementary antiparticles ==


== Composite antiparticles ==
== Particle–antiparticle annihilation ==

If a particle and antiparticle are in the appropriate quantum states, then they can annihilate each other and produce other particles. Reactions such as  +  →  (the two-photon annihilation of an electron-positron pair) are an example. The single-photon annihilation of an electron-positron pair,  +  → , cannot occur in free space because it is impossible to conserve energy and momentum together in this process. However, in the Coulomb field of a nucleus the translational invariance is broken and single-photon annihilation may occur. The reverse reaction (in free space, without an atomic nucleus) is also impossible for this reason. In quantum field theory, this process is allowed only as an intermediate quantum state for times short enough that the violation of energy conservation can be accommodated by the uncertainty principle. This opens the way for virtual pair production or annihilation in which a one particle quantum state may &quot;fluctuate&quot; into a two particle state and back. These processes are important in the vacuum state and renormalization of a quantum field theory. It also opens the way for neutral particle mixing through processes such as the one pictured here, which is a complicated example of mass renormalization.

== Properties ==

Quantum states of a particle and an antiparticle are interchanged by the combined application of charge conjugation formula_1, parity formula_2 and time reversal formula_3.
formula_1 and formula_2 are linear, unitary operators, formula_3 is antilinear and antiunitary, 
formula_7. 
If formula_8 denotes the quantum state of a particle formula_9 with momentum formula_10 and spin formula_11 whose component in the z-direction is formula_12, then one has
::formula_13
where formula_14 denotes the charge conjugate state, that is, the antiparticle. In particular a massive particle and its antiparticle transform under the same irreducible representation of the Poincaré group which means the antiparticle has the same mass and the same spin.

If formula_15, formula_16 and formula_17 
can be defined separately on the particles and antiparticles, then
::formula_18
::formula_19
::formula_20
where the proportionality sign indicates that there might be a phase on the right hand side.

As formula_21 anticommutes with the charges, formula_22, particle and antiparticle have opposite electric charges q and -q.

== Quantum field theory ==
:&quot;This section draws upon the ideas, language and notation of canonical quantization of a quantum field theory.&quot;

One may try to quantize an electron field without mixing the annihilation and creation operators by writing

::formula_23

where we use the symbol &quot;k&quot; to denote the quantum numbers &quot;p&quot; and σ of the previous section and the sign of the energy, &quot;E(k)&quot;, and &quot;ak&quot; denotes the corresponding annihilation operators. Of course, since we are dealing with fermions, we have to have the operators satisfy canonical anti-commutation relations. However, if one now writes down the Hamiltonian

::formula_24

then one sees immediately that the expectation value of &quot;H&quot; need not be positive. This is because &quot;E(k)&quot; can have any sign whatsoever, and the combination of creation and annihilation operators has expectation value 1 or 0.

So one has to introduce the charge conjugate &quot;antiparticle&quot; field, with its own creation and annihilation operators satisfying the relations

::formula_25

where &quot;k&quot; has the same &quot;p&quot;, and opposite σ and sign of the energy. Then one can rewrite the field in the form

::formula_26

where the first sum is over positive energy states and the second over those of negative energy. The energy becomes

::formula_27

where &quot;E0&quot; is an infinite negative constant. The vacuum state is defined as the state with no particle or antiparticle, &quot;i.e.&quot;, formula_28 and formula_29. Then the energy of the vacuum is exactly &quot;E0&quot;. Since all energies are measured relative to the vacuum, H is positive definite. Analysis of the properties of &quot;ak&quot; and &quot;bk&quot; shows that one is the annihilation operator for particles and the other for antiparticles. This is the case of a fermion.

This approach is due to Vladimir Fock, Wendell Furry and Robert Oppenheimer. If one quantizes a real scalar field, then one finds that there is only one kind of annihilation operator; therefore, real scalar fields describe neutral bosons. Since complex scalar fields admit two different kinds of annihilation operators, which are related by conjugation, such fields describe charged bosons.

=== Feynman–Stückelberg interpretation ===

By considering the propagation of the negative energy modes of the electron field backward in time, Ernst Stückelberg reached a pictorial understanding of the fact that the particle and antiparticle have equal mass m and spin J but opposite charges q. This allowed him to rewrite perturbation theory precisely in the form of diagrams. Richard Feynman later gave an independent systematic derivation of these diagrams from a particle formalism, and they are now called Feynman diagrams. Each line of a diagram represents a particle propagating either backward or forward in time. In Feynman diagrams, anti-particles are shown traveling backwards in time relative to normal matter, and vice versa. This technique is the most widespread method of computing amplitudes in quantum field theory today.

Since this picture was first developed by Stückelberg, and acquired its modern form in Feynman&#x27;s work, it is called the Feynman–Stückelberg interpretation of antiparticles to honor both scientists.

<text>Kim Renard Nazel (born June 17, 1965), better known by his stage names Arabian Prince or Professor X, is an American rapper and record producer. He was a founding member of N.W.A and contributed to a few tracks from &quot;N.W.A. and the Posse&quot; (1987) and their debut studio album &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; (1989), the latter of which was released shortly after he left the group.

==Early life==
Nazel was born in Compton, California, to the son of Joseph &quot;Skippy&quot; Nazel Jr., an African American author and radio talk show host. His musical background came from his mother, a piano teacher and classical musician. His family tried its best to shelter him, sending him to a Catholic school and keeping him busy with football to keep him away from the gangs. The younger Nazel got his first experience with making music at the radio station his father hosted his talk show on; Nazel used the radio station&#x27;s equipment to put together mixtapes that he would sell at school. Nazel went on to graduate from Junípero Serra High School in nearby Gardena.

==Music career==
Nazel took the stage name of DJ Prince and started selling mixtapes at school. While working at a Petshop at a Lennox California Mall, its owner, Sam Nassif, asked him to DJ a party at a community dance hall. He kept performing there for several weekends and the success persuaded Nassif to invest even more in the place, renaming it &quot;The Cave&quot;,(And Later &quot;The Basement&quot;) where Nazel would continue to host for over three years and even after his N.W.A days. Nassif also funded DJ Prince&#x27;s first record, &quot;Strange Life&quot;.

He changed his stage name when he was 15 years old at the Skateland USA, the same skating venue credited for launching N.W.A a few years later, due to a fan&#x27;s suggestion. He said about his name:

Arabian Prince started working with Bobby Jimmy &amp; the Critters in 1984. He also produced the hit single and album for J.J. Fad, &quot;Supersonic&quot;.

In 1987, he was a founding member of N.W.A, helping with production on some tracks and appearing as a vocalist on &quot;Panic Zone&quot; from &quot;N.W.A. and the Posse&quot; (1987) and the last track off the group&#x27;s debut studio album &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; (1989), &quot;Something 2 Dance 2&quot;, a relatively radio-friendly song which was also removed from later pressings of the album due to a dispute. Arabian Prince left N.W.A in late 1988, shortly before the release of &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;, over royalty and contract disagreements. &quot;I started off as a solo artist&quot;, he said, &quot;so I was aware of what a royalty statement was. I knew that when these many records were sold, there is a quarterly statement. When you look at it, you can see how much money was paid and then share it. This was not the case. We were also never paid for touring.&quot; Eazy-E, Ice Cube and MC Ren remained as the main performers, DJ Yella was the turntablist and Dr. Dre was the main producer.

After leaving N.W.A, Arabian Prince began a solo career. His first album, &quot;Brother Arab&quot;, was released in 1989 with the single &quot;She&#x27;s Got A Big Posse&quot;; &quot;Where&#x27;s My Bytches&quot; followed in 1993.

In the mid-2000s, he started releasing music again, with his Professor X project on the Dutch label Clone Records. &quot;I could not release the record under Arabian Prince&quot;, he said, &quot;because I already had a single out, so I called myself Professor X on that record.&quot; In 2007, he performed as a DJ on the 2K Sports Holiday Bounce Tour with artists from the Stones Throw label. In 2008, Stones Throw released a compilation of his electro-rap material from the 1980s. One of his songs was included on the 2007 video game, &quot;College Hoops 2K8&quot;.

In 2015, a biopic about N.W.A. titled &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; was released; however, Arabian Prince was not portrayed in the film. After the release film, Prince said to VladTV: &quot;A lot of the scenes in real life, I was there—I&#x27;m just not there in the film, which I&#x27;m like, if you&#x27;re gonna write me out of a movie, shoot some other scenes. Don&#x27;t write scenes where I was there.&quot; Some of the pivotal scenes would be choosing the name for the band, the tour and the infamous Detroit concert. He also remembers himself as the main opposer to Jerry Heller about the royalties and the money, a role that in the film was instead given to Ice Cube.

The following year, N.W.A. was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but again, Arabian Prince was not included nor mentioned.

In 2018, Arabian Prince appeared on the &quot;AmeriKKKant&quot; album of industrial-metal band Ministry. He made a second appearance on Ministry&#x27;s 2021 album &quot;Moral Hygiene&quot;.

==Other ventures==
Aside from his music career, he worked in special effects, 3D animation and video games.

<doc id="1335" wikidata="Q177251" url="?curid=1335" title="Associative property">
<text>In mathematics, the associative property is a property of some binary operations that rearranging the parentheses in an expression will not change the result. In propositional logic, associativity is a valid rule of replacement for expressions in logical proofs.

Within an expression containing two or more occurrences in a row of the same associative operator, the order in which the operations are performed does not matter as long as the sequence of the operands is not changed. That is (after rewriting the expression with parentheses and in infix notation if necessary), rearranging the parentheses in such an expression will not change its value. Consider the following equations:

formula_1

Even though the parentheses were rearranged on each line, the values of the expressions were not altered. Since this holds true when performing addition and multiplication on any real numbers, it can be said that &quot;addition and multiplication of real numbers are associative operations&quot;.

Associativity is not the same as commutativity, which addresses whether the order of two operands affects the result. For example, the order does not matter in the multiplication of real numbers, that is, , so we say that the multiplication of real numbers is a commutative operation. However, operations such as function composition and matrix multiplication are associative, but not (generally) commutative.

Associative operations are abundant in mathematics; in fact, many algebraic structures (such as semigroups and categories) explicitly require their binary operations to be associative.

However, many important and interesting operations are non-associative; some examples include subtraction, exponentiation, and the vector cross product. In contrast to the theoretical properties of real numbers, the addition of floating point numbers in computer science is not associative, and the choice of how to associate an expression can have a significant effect on rounding error.

== Definition ==

Formally, a binary operation formula_2 on a set is called associative if it satisfies the associative law:
:formula_3, for all formula_4 in .

Here, ∗ is used to replace the symbol of the operation, which may be any symbol, and even the absence of symbol (juxtaposition) as for multiplication.
:formula_5, for all formula_4 in .

The associative law can also be expressed in functional notation thus: formula_7

==Generalized associative law==

If a binary operation is associative, repeated application of the operation produces the same result regardless of how valid pairs of parentheses are inserted in the expression. This is called the generalized associative law.

The number of possible bracketings is just the Catalan number, formula_8
, for &quot;n&quot; operations on &quot;n+1&quot; values. For instance, a product of 3 operations on 4 elements may be written (ignoring permutations of the arguments), in formula_9 possible ways:

*formula_10
*formula_11
*formula_12
*formula_13
*formula_14

If the product operation is associative, the generalized associative law says that all these expressions will yield the same result. So unless the expression with omitted parentheses already has a different meaning (see below), the parentheses can be considered unnecessary and &quot;the&quot; product can be written unambiguously as
:formula_15
As the number of elements increases, the number of possible ways to insert parentheses grows quickly, but they remain unnecessary for disambiguation.

An example where this does not work is the logical biconditional . It is associative; thus, is equivalent to , but most commonly means , which is not equivalent.

==Examples==

Some examples of associative operations include the following.

== Propositional logic ==
=== Rule of replacement ===
In standard truth-functional propositional logic, &quot;association&quot;, or &quot;associativity&quot; are two valid rules of replacement. The rules allow one to move parentheses in logical expressions in logical proofs. The rules (using logical connectives notation) are:

formula_16

and

formula_17

where &quot;formula_18&quot; is a metalogical symbol representing &quot;can be replaced in a proof with&quot;.

=== Truth functional connectives ===
&quot;Associativity&quot; is a property of some logical connectives of truth-functional propositional logic. The following logical equivalences demonstrate that associativity is a property of particular connectives. The following (and their converses, since is commutative) are truth-functional tautologies.

;Associativity of disjunction
:formula_19
;Associativity of conjunction
:formula_20
;Associativity of equivalence
:formula_21

Joint denial is an example of a truth functional connective that is &quot;not&quot; associative.

== Non-associative operation==
A binary operation formula_22 on a set &quot;S&quot; that does not satisfy the associative law is called non-associative. Symbolically,

formula_23

For such an operation the order of evaluation &quot;does&quot; matter. For example:
; Subtraction
:formula_24
; Division
:formula_25
; Exponentiation
:formula_26
; Vector cross product
:formula_27

Also although addition is associative for finite sums, it is not associative inside infinite sums (series). For example,
formula_28
whereas
formula_29

Some non-associative operations are fundamental in mathematics. They appear often as the multiplication in structures called non-associative algebras, which have also an addition and a scalar multiplication. Examples are the octonions and Lie algebras. In Lie algebras, the multiplication satisfies Jacobi identity instead of the associative law; this allows abstracting the algebraic nature of infinitesimal transformations.

Other examples are quasigroup, quasifield, non-associative ring, and commutative non-associative magmas.

===Nonassociativity of floating point calculation===

In mathematics, addition and multiplication of real numbers are associative. By contrast, in computer science, addition and multiplication of floating point numbers are &quot;not&quot; associative, as different rounding errors may be introduced when dissimilar-sized values are joined in a different order.

To illustrate this, consider a floating point representation with a 4-bit significand:


Even though most computers compute with 24 or 53 bits of significand, this is still an important source of rounding error, and approaches such as the Kahan summation algorithm are ways to minimise the errors. It can be especially problematic in parallel computing.

=== Notation for non-associative operations ===
In general, parentheses must be used to indicate the order of evaluation if a non-associative operation appears more than once in an expression (unless the notation specifies the order in another way, like formula_30). However, mathematicians agree on a particular order of evaluation for several common non-associative operations. This is simply a notational convention to avoid parentheses.

A left-associative operation is a non-associative operation that is conventionally evaluated from left to right, i.e.,

formula_31

while a right-associative operation is conventionally evaluated from right to left:

formula_32

Both left-associative and right-associative operations occur. Left-associative operations include the following:
; Subtraction and division of real numbers
:formula_33
:formula_34
; Function application
:formula_35
This notation can be motivated by the currying isomorphism, which enables partial application.

Right-associative operations include the following:
; Exponentiation of real numbers in superscript notation
:formula_36Exponentiation is commonly used with brackets or right-associatively because a repeated left-associative exponentiation operation is of little use. Repeated powers would mostly be rewritten with multiplication:
:formula_37Formatted correctly, the superscript inherently behaves as a set of parentheses; e.g. in the expression formula_38 the addition is performed before the exponentiation despite there being no explicit parentheses formula_39 wrapped around it. Thus given an expression such as formula_40, the full exponent formula_41 of the base formula_42 is evaluated first. However, in some contexts, especially in handwriting, the difference between formula_43, formula_44 and formula_36 can be hard to see. In such a case, right-associativity is usually implied.
; Function definition
:formula_46
:formula_47Using right-associative notation for these operations can be motivated by the Curry–Howard correspondence and by the currying isomorphism.

Non-associative operations for which no conventional evaluation order is defined include the following.
; Exponentiation of real numbers in infix notation
:formula_48
; Knuth&#x27;s up-arrow operators
:formula_49
:formula_50
; Taking the cross product of three vectors
:formula_51
; Taking the pairwise average of real numbers
:formula_52
; Taking the relative complement of sets 
:formula_53.(Compare material nonimplication in logic.)

== History ==

William Rowan Hamilton seems to have coined the term &quot;associative property&quot; around 1844, a time when he was contemplating the non-associative algebra of the octonions he had learned about from John T. Graves.

<text>The Apache Software Foundation ( ; ASF) is an American nonprofit corporation (classified as a 501(c)(3) organization in the United States) to support a number of open-source software projects. The ASF was formed from a group of developers of the Apache HTTP Server, and incorporated on March 25, 1999. it includes approximately 1000 members.

The Apache Software Foundation is a decentralized open source community of developers. The software they produce is distributed under the terms of the Apache License, a permissive open-source license for free and open-source software (FOSS). The Apache projects are characterized by a collaborative, consensus-based development process and an open and pragmatic software license, which is to say that it allows developers, who receive the software freely, to redistribute it under non-free terms. Each project is managed by a self-selected team of technical experts who are active contributors to the project. The ASF is a meritocracy, implying that membership of the foundation is granted only to volunteers who have actively contributed to Apache projects.

Among the ASF&#x27;s objectives are: to provide legal protection to volunteers working on Apache projects, and to prevent the &quot;Apache&quot; brand name from being used by other organizations without permission.

The ASF also holds several ApacheCon conferences each year, highlighting Apache projects and related technology.

==History==
The history of the Apache Software Foundation is linked to the Apache HTTP Server, development beginning in February 1993. A group of eight developers started working on enhancing the NCSA HTTPd daemon. They came to be known as the Apache Group. On March 25, 1999, the Apache Software Foundation was formed. The first official meeting of the Apache Software Foundation was held on April 13, 1999. The initial members of the Apache Software Foundation consisted of the Apache Group: Brian Behlendorf, Ken Coar, Miguel Gonzales, Mark Cox, Lars Eilebrecht, Ralf S. Engelschall, Roy T. Fielding, Dean Gaudet, Ben Hyde, Jim Jagielski, Alexei Kosut, Martin Kraemer, Ben Laurie, Doug MacEachern, Aram Mirzadeh, Sameer Parekh, Cliff Skolnick, Marc Slemko, William (Bill) Stoddard, Paul Sutton, Randy Terbush and Dirk-Willem van Gulik. After a series of additional meetings to elect board members and resolve other legal matters regarding incorporation, the effective incorporation date of the Apache Software Foundation was set to June 1, 1999.

Co-founder Brian Behlendorf states how the name &#x27;Apache&#x27; was chosen: &quot;I suggested the name Apache partly because the web technologies at the time that were launching were being called cyber this or spider that or something on those themes and I was like we need something a little more interesting, a little more romantic, not to be a cultural appropriator or anything like that, I had just seen a documentary about Geronimo and the last days of a Native American tribe called the Apaches right, who succumbed to the invasion from the West, from the United States, and they were the last tribe to give up their territory and for me that almost romantically represented what I felt we were doing with this web-server project...&quot;

==Projects==

Apache divides its software development activities into separate semi-autonomous areas called &quot;top-level projects&quot; (formally known as a &quot;Project Management Committee&quot; in the bylaws), some of which have a number of sub-projects. Unlike some other organizations that host FOSS projects, before a project is hosted at Apache it has to be licensed to the ASF with a grant or contributor agreement. In this way, the ASF gains the necessary intellectual property rights for the development and distribution of all its projects.

==Board of directors==
The Board of Directors of The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) is responsible for management and oversight of the business and affairs of the corporation in accordance with the Bylaws. This includes management of the corporate assets (funds, intellectual property, trademarks, and support equipment), appointment of a President and corporate officers managing the core operations of the ASF, and allocation of corporate resources for the benefit of Apache projects. Technical decision-making authority for every Apache project is assigned to their independent project management committee; the participants in each project provide direction, not the board.
The board is elected annually by the ASF membership.

Since September 18, 2024, the board of directors has been:

* Rich Bowen
* Shane Curcuru
* Willem Ning Jiang
* Jeff Jirsa
* Justin Mclean
* Jean-Baptiste Onofré
* Craig L Russell
* Sander Striker
* Kanchana Pradeepika Welagedara

<doc id="1338" wikidata="Q1111004" url="?curid=1338" title="Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990">
<text>The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 or ADA () is a civil rights law that prohibits discrimination based on disability. It affords similar protections against discrimination to Americans with disabilities as the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which made discrimination based on race, religion, sex, national origin, and other characteristics illegal, and later sexual orientation and gender identity. In addition, unlike the Civil Rights Act, the ADA also requires covered employers to provide reasonable accommodations to employees with disabilities, and imposes accessibility requirements on public accommodations.

In 1986, the National Council on Disability had recommended the enactment of an Americans with Disabilities Act and drafted the first version of the bill which was introduced in the House and Senate in 1988. A broad bipartisan coalition of legislators supported the ADA, while the bill was opposed by business interests (who argued the bill imposed costs on business) and conservative evangelicals (who opposed protection for individuals with HIV). The final version of the bill was signed into law on July 26, 1990, by President George H. W. Bush. It was later amended in 2008 and signed by President George W. Bush with changes effective as of January 1, 2009.

==Disabilities included==

Conditions classed as disabilities under the ADA include both mental and physical conditions. A condition does not need to be severe or permanent to be a disability. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission regulations provide a list of conditions that should easily be concluded to be disabilities: amputation, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, bipolar disorder, blindness, cancer, cerebral palsy, deafness, diabetes, epilepsy, HIV/AIDS, intellectual disability, major depressive disorder, mobility impairments requiring a wheelchair, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and schizophrenia. Other mental or physical health conditions also may be disabilities, depending on what the individual&#x27;s symptoms would be in the absence of &quot;mitigating measures&quot; such as medication, therapy, assistive devices, or other means of restoring function, during an &quot;active episode&quot; of the condition (if the condition is episodic).

Certain specific conditions that are widely considered anti-social, or tend to result in illegal activity, such as kleptomania, pedophilia, exhibitionism, voyeurism, etc. are excluded under the definition of &quot;disability&quot; in order to prevent abuse of the statute&#x27;s purpose. Additionally, sexual orientation is no longer considered a disorder and is also excluded from the definition of &quot;disability&quot;. However, in 2022, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit stated that the ADA covers individuals with gender dysphoria, which may aid transgender people in accessing legal protections they otherwise may be unable to.

==Titles==
===Title I—employment ===
: &quot;See also US labor law and .&quot;
The ADA states that a &quot;covered entity&quot; shall not discriminate against &quot;a qualified individual with a disability&quot;. This applies to job application procedures, hiring, advancement and discharge of employees, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment. &quot;Covered entities&quot; include employers with 15 or more employees, as well as employment agencies, labor organizations, and joint labor-management committees. There are strict limitations on when a covered entity can ask job applicants or employees disability-related questions or require them to undergo medical examination, and all medical information must be kept confidential.

Prohibited discrimination may include, among other things, firing or refusing to hire someone based on a real or perceived disability, segregation, and harassment based on a disability. Covered entities are also required to provide reasonable accommodations to job applicants and employees with disabilities. A reasonable accommodation is a change in the way things are typically done that the person needs because of a disability, and can include, among other things, special equipment that allows the person to perform the job, scheduling changes, and changes to the way work assignments are chosen or communicated. An employer is not required to provide an accommodation that would involve undue hardship (excessive difficulty or expense), and the individual who receives the accommodation must still perform the essential functions of the job and meet the normal performance requirements. An employee or applicant who currently engages in the illegal use of drugs is not considered qualified when a covered entity takes adverse action based on such use.

Part of Title I was found unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court as it pertains to states in the case of &quot;Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett&quot; as violating the sovereign immunity rights of the several states as specified by the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Court determined that state employees cannot sue their employer for violating ADA rules. State employees can, however, file complaints at the Department of Justice or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, who can sue on their behalf.

===Title II—public entities (and public transportation) ===
Title II prohibits disability discrimination by all public entities at the local level, e.g., school district, municipal, city, or county, and at state level. Public entities must comply with Title II regulations by the U.S. Department of Justice. These regulations cover access to all programs and services offered by the entity. Access includes physical access described in the ADA Standards for Accessible Design and programmatic access that might be obstructed by discriminatory policies or procedures of the entity.

Title II applies to public transportation provided by public entities through regulations by the U.S. Department of Transportation. It includes the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak), along with all other commuter authorities. This section requires the provision of paratransit services by public entities that provide fixed-route services. ADA also sets minimum requirements for space layout in order to facilitate wheelchair securement on public transport.

Title II also applies to all state and local public housing, housing assistance, and housing referrals. The Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity is charged with enforcing this provision.

===Title III—public accommodations (and commercial facilities) ===

Under Title III, no individual may be discriminated against on the basis of disability with regards to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns, leases, or operates a place of public accommodation. Public accommodations include most places of lodging (such as inns and hotels), recreation, transportation, education, and dining, along with stores, care providers, and places of public displays.

Under Title III of the ADA, all new construction (construction, modification or alterations) after the effective date of the ADA (approximately July 1992) must be fully compliant with the Americans With Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) found in the Code of Federal Regulations at 28 C.F.R., Part 36, Appendix &quot;A&quot;.

Title III also has applications to existing facilities. One of the definitions of &quot;discrimination&quot; under Title III of the ADA is a &quot;failure to remove&quot; architectural barriers in existing facilities. See . This means that even facilities that have not been modified or altered in any way after the ADA was passed still have obligations. The standard is whether &quot;removing barriers&quot; (typically defined as bringing a condition into compliance with the ADAAG) is &quot;readily achievable&quot;, defined as &quot;...easily accomplished without much difficulty or expense&quot;.

The statutory definition of &quot;readily achievable&quot; calls for a balancing test between the cost of the proposed alteration and the wherewithal of the business and/or owners of the business. Thus, what might be &quot;readily achievable&quot; for a sophisticated and financially capable corporation might not be readily achievable for a small or local business.

There are exceptions to this title; many private clubs and religious organizations may not be bound by Title III. With regard to historic properties (those properties that are listed or that are eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places, or properties designated as historic under state or local law), those facilities must still comply with the provisions of Title III of the ADA to the &quot;maximum extent feasible&quot; but if following the usual standards would &quot;threaten to destroy the historic significance of a feature of the building&quot; then alternative standards may be used.

Under 2010 revisions of Department of Justice regulations, newly constructed or altered swimming pools, wading pools, and spas must have an accessible means of entrance and exit to pools for disabled people. However, the requirement is conditioned on whether providing access through a fixed lift is &quot;readily achievable&quot;. Other requirements exist, based on pool size, include providing a certain number of accessible means of entry and exit, which are outlined in Section 242 of the standards. However, businesses are free to consider the differences in the application of the rules depending on whether the pool is new or altered, or whether the swimming pool was in existence before the effective date of the new rule. Full compliance may not be required for existing facilities; Section 242 and 1009 of the 2010 Standards outline such exceptions.

====Service animals====

ADA provides explicit coverage for service animals. Guidelines protect persons with disabilities and indemnify businesses from damages related to granting access to service animals. Businesses are allowed to ask if the animal is a service animal and ask what tasks it is trained to perform, but are not allowed to ask the service animal to perform the task nor ask for an animal ID. They cannot ask what the person&#x27;s disabilities are. A person with a disability cannot be removed from the premises unless one of two things happen: the animal is out of control and its owner cannot control it (e.g., a dog barking uncontrollably), or the animal is a direct threat to someone&#x27;s health and safety. Allergies and fear of animals are not considered to be such a threat. 

Businesses that prepare or serve food must allow service animals and their owners on the premises even if state or local health laws otherwise prohibit animals. Businesses that prepare or serve food are not required to provide care, food, a relief area for service animals. Extra fees for service animals are forbidden. They cannot be discriminated against, such as by isolation from people at a restaurant. 

People with disabilities cannot be treated as &quot;less than&quot; other customers. However, if a business normally charges for damages caused by the person to property, damage caused by a service animal can also require compensation.

====Auxiliary aids ====

The ADA provides explicit coverage for auxiliary aids.

ADA says that &quot;a public accommodation shall take those steps that may be necessary to ensure that no individual with a disability is excluded, denied services, segregated or otherwise treated differently than other individuals because of the absence of auxiliary aids and services, unless the public accommodation can demonstrate that taking those steps would fundamentally alter the nature of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations being offered or would result in an undue burden, i.e., significant difficulty or expense.&quot; The term &quot;auxiliary aids and services&quot; includes:

# Qualified interpreters on-site or through video remote interpreting (VRI) services; notetakers; real-time computer-aided transcription services; written materials; exchange of written notes; telephone handset amplifiers; assistive listening devices; assistive listening systems; telephones compatible with hearing aids; closed caption decoders; open and closed captioning, including real-time captioning; voice, text, and video-based telecommunications products and systems, including text telephones (TTYs), videophones, and captioned telephones, or equally effective telecommunications devices; videotext displays; accessible electronic and information technology; or other effective methods of making aurally delivered information available to individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing;
# Qualified readers; taped texts; audio recordings; Brailled materials and displays; screen reader software; magnification software; optical readers; secondary auditory programs (SAP); large print materials; accessible electronic and information technology; or other effective methods of making visually delivered materials available to individuals who are blind or have low vision;
# Acquisition or modification of equipment or devices; and
# Other similar services and actions.

Captions are considered one type of auxiliary aid. Since the passage of the ADA, the use of captioning has expanded. Entertainment, educational, informational, and training materials are captioned for deaf and hard-of-hearing audiences at the time they are produced and distributed. The Television Decoder Circuitry Act of 1990 requires that all televisions larger than 13 inches sold in the United States after July 1993 have a special built-in decoder that enables viewers to watch closed-captioned programming. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to adopt rules requiring closed captioning of most television programming. The FCC&#x27;s rules on closed captioning became effective January 1, 1998.

===Title IV—telecommunications ===
Title IV of the ADA amended the Communications Act of 1934 primarily by adding section . This section requires that all telecommunications companies in the U.S. take steps to ensure functionally equivalent services for consumers with disabilities, notably those who are deaf or hard of hearing and those with speech impairments. When Title IV took effect in the early 1990s, it led to the installation of public teletypewriter (TTY) machines and other TDD (telecommunications devices for the deaf). Title IV also led to the creation, in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, of what was then called dual-party relay services and now are known as Telecommunications Relay Services (TRS), such as STS relay. Today, many TRS-mediated calls are made over the Internet by consumers who use broadband connections. Some are Video Relay Service (VRS) calls, while others are text calls. In either variation, communication assistants translate between the signed or typed words of a consumer and the spoken words of others. In 2006, according to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), VRS calls averaged two million minutes a month.

===Title V—miscellaneous provisions ===
Title V includes technical provisions. It discusses, for example, the fact that nothing in the ADA amends, overrides or cancels anything in Section 504. Additionally, Title V includes an anti-retaliation or coercion provision. The &quot;Technical Assistance Manual&quot; for the ADA explains this provision:

==History==
The ADA has roots in Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.

===Drafting===

The law began in the Virginia House of Delegates in 1985 as the Virginians with Disabilities Act—supported by Warren G. Stambaugh—which was passed by the state Virginia. It is the first iteration of the Americans with Disabilities Act.

In 1986, the National Council on Disability (NCD), an independent federal agency, issued a report, Towards Independence, in which the Council examined incentives and disincentives in federal laws towards increasing the independence and full integration of people with disabilities into U.S. society. Among the disincentives to independence the Council identified was the existence of large remaining gaps in civil rights coverage for people with disabilities in the United States. A principal conclusion of the report was to recommend the adoption of comprehensive civil rights legislation, which became the ADA.

The idea of federal legislation enhancing and extending civil rights legislation to millions of Americans with disabilities gained bipartisan support in late 1988 and early 1989. In early 1989 both Congress and the newly inaugurated Bush White House worked separately, then jointly, to write legislation capable of expanding civil rights without imposing undue harm or costs on those already in compliance with existing rules and laws.

===Lobbying===
Over the years, key activists and advocates played an important role in lobbying members of the U.S. Congress to develop and pass the ADA, including Justin Whitlock Dart Jr., Patrisha Wright and others.

Wright is known as &quot;the General&quot; for her work in coordinating the campaign to enact the ADA. She is widely considered the main force behind the campaign lobbying for the ADA.

===Support and opposition===
====Support====
Senator Bob Dole was a supporter and advocate for the bill.

====Opposition from religious groups====
Conservative evangelicals opposed the ADA because the legislation protected individuals with HIV, which they associated with homosexuality.

The debate over the Americans with Disabilities Act led some religious groups to take opposite positions. The Association of Christian Schools International opposed the ADA in its original form, primarily because the ADA labeled religious institutions &quot;public accommodations&quot; and thus would have required churches to make costly structural changes to ensure access for all. The cost argument advanced by ACSI and others prevailed in keeping religious institutions from being labeled as &quot;public accommodations&quot;. Church groups such as the National Association of Evangelicals testified against the ADA&#x27;s Title I employment provisions on grounds of religious liberty. The NAE believed the regulation of the internal employment of churches was &quot;... an improper intrusion [of] the federal government.&quot;

====Opposition from business interests====
Many companies, corporations, and business groups opposed the Americans with Disabilities Act, arguing that the legislation would impose costs on businesses. Testifying before Congress, Greyhound Bus Lines stated that the act had the potential to &quot;deprive millions of people of affordable intercity public transportation and thousands of rural communities of their only link to the outside world.&quot; The US Chamber of Commerce argued that the costs of the ADA would be &quot;enormous&quot; and have &quot;a disastrous impact on many small businesses struggling to survive.&quot; The National Federation of Independent Business, an organization that lobbies for small businesses, called the ADA &quot;a disaster for small business&quot;. Pro-business conservative commentators joined in opposition, writing that the Americans with Disabilities Act was &quot;an expensive headache to millions&quot; that would not necessarily improve the lives of people with disabilities.

===&quot;Capitol Crawl&quot;===
Shortly before the act was passed, disability rights activists with physical disabilities coalesced in front of the Capitol Building, shed their crutches, wheelchairs, powerchairs and other assistive devices, and immediately proceeded to crawl and pull their bodies up all 100 of the Capitol&#x27;s front steps, without warning. As the activists did so, many of them chanted &quot;ADA now&quot;, and &quot;Vote, Now&quot;. Some activists who remained at the bottom of the steps held signs and yelled words of encouragement at the &quot;Capitol Crawlers&quot;. Jennifer Keelan, a second grader with cerebral palsy, was videotaped as she pulled herself up the steps, using mostly her hands and arms, saying &quot;I&#x27;ll take all night if I have to.&quot; This direct action is reported to have &quot;inconvenienced&quot; several senators and to have pushed them to approve the act. While there are those who do not attribute much overall importance to this action, the &quot;Capitol Crawl&quot; of 1990 is seen by some present-day disability activists in the United States as a central act for encouraging the ADA into law.

===Final passage===
Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA) authored what became the final bill and was its chief sponsor in the Senate. Harkin delivered part of his introduction speech in sign language, saying it was so his deaf brother could understand.

President George H. W. Bush, on signing the measure on July 26, 1990, said:

===ADA Amendments Act, 2008===
The ADA defines a covered disability as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, a history of having such an impairment, or being regarded as having such an impairment. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) was charged with interpreting the 1990 law with regard to discrimination in employment. The EEOC developed regulations limiting an individual&#x27;s impairment to one that &quot;severely or significantly restricts&quot; a major life activity. The ADAAA directed the EEOC to amend its regulations and replace &quot;severely or significantly&quot; with &quot;substantially limits&quot;, a more lenient standard.

On September 25, 2008, President George W. Bush signed the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA) into law. The amendment broadened the definition of &quot;disability&quot;, thereby extending the ADA&#x27;s protections to a greater number of people. The ADAAA also added to the ADA examples of &quot;major life activities&quot; including, but not limited to, &quot;caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working&quot; as well as the operation of several specified &quot;major bodily functions&quot;. The act overturned a 1999 US Supreme Court case that held that an employee was not disabled if the impairment could be corrected by mitigating measures; it specifically provides that such impairment must be determined without considering such ameliorative measures. It also overturned the court&#x27;s finding that an impairment that substantially limits one major life activity must also limit others to be considered a disability.
In 2008, the United States House Committee on Education and Labor stated that the amendment &quot;makes it absolutely clear that the ADA is intended to provide broad coverage to protect anyone who faces discrimination on the basis of disability.&quot; Thus the ADAAA led to broader coverage of impaired employees.

===Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, 2019===
In October 2019, the Supreme Court declined to resolve a circuit split as to whether websites are covered by the ADA. The Court turned down an appeal from Domino&#x27;s Pizza and let stand a U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling which held that the Americans with Disabilities Act protects access not just to brick-and-mortar public accommodations, but also to the websites and apps of those businesses.

==Impact==
The ADA led to significant improvements in terms of access to public services, accessibility in the built environment, and societal understanding of disability.

===Accessibility===
===Employment===

Between 1991 (after the enactment of the ADA) and 1995, the employment rate of men with disabilities dropped by 7.8% regardless of age, educational level, or type of disability, with the most affected being young, less-educated and intellectually disabled men. While no causal link between the ADA and that trend has been definitively identified, some researchers have characterized the ADA as ineffectual and argued that it caused this decline by raising the cost of doing business for employers, who quietly avoid hiring people with disabilities for fear of lawsuit. To these employers, hiring people with disabilities became too expensive as they had to spend extra on assistive technology.

In 2001, for men of all working ages and women under 40, Current Population Survey data showed a sharp drop in the employment of disabled workers, leading at least two economists to attribute the cause to the Act. By contrast, a study in 2003 found that while the Act may have led to short term reactions by employers, in the long term, there were either positive or neutral consequences for wages and employment. In 2005, the rate of employment among disabled people increased to 45% of the population of disabled people.

===Societal attitudes===
===&quot;Professional plaintiffs&quot;===
Since enforcement of the act began in July 1992, it has quickly become a major component of employment law. The ADA allows private plaintiffs to receive only injunctive relief (a court order requiring the public accommodation to remedy violations of the accessibility regulations) and attorneys&#x27; fees, and does not provide monetary rewards to private plaintiffs who sue non-compliant businesses. Unless a state law, such as the California Unruh Civil Rights Act, provides for monetary damages to private plaintiffs, persons with disabilities do not obtain direct financial benefits from suing businesses that violate the ADA.

The attorneys&#x27; fees provision of Title III does provide incentive for lawyers to specialize and engage in serial ADA litigation, but a disabled plaintiff does not obtain a financial reward from attorneys&#x27; fees unless they act as their own attorney, or as mentioned above, a disabled plaintiff resides in a state that provides for minimum compensation and court fees in lawsuits. Moreover, there may be a benefit to these private attorneys general who identify and compel the correction of illegal conditions: they may increase the number of public accommodations accessible to persons with disabilities. &quot;Civil rights law depends heavily on private enforcement. Moreover, the inclusion of penalties and damages is the driving force that facilitates voluntary compliance with the ADA.&quot; Courts have noted:

However, in states that have enacted laws that allow private individuals to win monetary awards from non-compliant businesses (as of 2008, these include California, Florida, Hawaii, and Illinois), &quot;professional plaintiffs&quot; are typically found. At least one of these plaintiffs in California has been barred by courts from filing lawsuits unless he receives prior court permission. Through the end of fiscal year 1998, 86% of the 106,988 ADA charges filed with and resolved by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, were either dropped or investigated and dismissed by EEOC but not without imposing opportunity costs and legal fees on employers.

==Case law==

There have been some notable cases regarding the ADA. For example, a major hotel room marketer (Hotels.com) with their business presence on the Internet was sued because their customers with disabilities could not reserve hotel rooms through their website without substantial extra efforts that persons without disabilities were not required to perform. Such lawsuits represent a major potential expansion of the ADA in that they (known as &quot;bricks vs. clicks&quot;), seek to expand the ADA&#x27;s authority to cyberspace, where entities may not have actual physical facilities that are required to comply.

===&quot;Green v. State of California&quot;===
&quot;Green v. State of California, No. S137770 (Cal. August 23, 2007)&quot; was a case in which the California Supreme Court was faced with deciding whether an employee suing the state is required to prove they are able to perform &quot;essential&quot; job duties, regardless of whether or not there was &quot;reasonable accommodation&quot;, or if the employer must prove the person suing was unable to do so. The court ruled the burden was on the employee, not the employer, and reversed a disputed decision by the lower courts. Plaintiff attorney David Greenberg brought forth considerations of the concept that, even in the state of California, employers do not have to employ a worker who is unable to perform &quot;essential job functions&quot; with &quot;reasonable accommodation&quot;. Forcing employers to do so &quot;would defy logic and establish a poor public policy in employment matters.&quot;

===&quot;National Federation of the Blind v. Target Corporation&quot;===

&quot;National Federation of the Blind v. Target Corp.&quot; was a case where a major retailer, Target Corp., was sued because their web designers failed to design its website to enable persons with low or no vision to use it.

===&quot;Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett&quot;===

&quot;Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett&quot; was a United States Supreme Court case about Congress&#x27;s enforcement powers under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. It decided that Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act was unconstitutional insofar as it allowed private citizens to sue states for money damages.

===&quot;Barden v. The City of Sacramento&quot;===
&quot;Barden v. The City of Sacramento&quot;, filed in March 1999, claimed that the City of Sacramento failed to comply with the ADA when, while making public street improvements, it did not bring its sidewalks into compliance with the ADA. Certain issues were resolved in federal court. One issue, whether sidewalks were covered by the ADA, was appealed to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled that sidewalks were a &quot;program&quot; under the ADA and must be made accessible to persons with disabilities. The ruling was later appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which refused to hear the case, letting stand the ruling of the 9th Circuit.

===&quot;Bates v. United Parcel Service, Inc&quot;===

&quot;Bates v. United Parcel Service, Inc (UPS;&quot; begun in 1999) was the first equal opportunity employment class action brought on behalf of Deaf and Hard of Hearing workers throughout the country concerning workplace discrimination. It established legal precedent for these employees to be fully covered under the ADA. Key findings included:
# UPS failed to address communication barriers and to ensure equal conditions and opportunities for deaf employees;
# Deaf employees were routinely excluded from workplace information, denied opportunities for promotion, and exposed to unsafe conditions due to lack of accommodations by UPS;
# UPS also lacked a system to alert these employees as to emergencies, such as fires or chemical spills, to ensure that they would safely evacuate their facility; and
# UPS had no policy to ensure that deaf applicants and employees actually received effective communication in the workplace.
The outcome was that UPS agreed to pay a $5.8 million award and agreed to a comprehensive accommodations program that was implemented in their facilities throughout the country.

===&quot;Spector v. Norwegian Cruise Line Ltd.&quot;===

&quot;Spector v. Norwegian Cruise Line Ltd.&quot; was a case that was decided by the United States Supreme Court in 2005. The defendant argued that as a vessel flying the flag of a foreign nation it was exempt from the requirements of the ADA. This argument was accepted by a federal court in Florida and, subsequently, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. However, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the ruling of the lower courts on the basis that Norwegian Cruise Lines was a business headquartered in the United States whose clients were predominantly Americans and, more importantly, operated out of port facilities throughout the United States.

===&quot;Olmstead v. L.C.&quot;===
&quot;Olmstead v. L.C.&quot; was a case before the United States Supreme Court in 1999. The two plaintiffs, Lois Curtis and E.W., were institutionalized in Georgia for diagnosed &quot;mental retardation&quot; and schizophrenia. Clinical assessments by the state determined that the plaintiffs could be appropriately treated in a community setting rather than the state institution. The plaintiffs sued the state of Georgia and the institution for being inappropriately treated and housed in the institutional setting rather than being treated in one of the state&#x27;s community-based treatment facilities.

The Supreme Court decided under Title II of the ADA that mental illness is a form of disability and therefore covered under the ADA, and that unjustified institutional isolation of a person with a disability is a form of discrimination because it &quot;...perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that persons so isolated are incapable or unworthy of participating in community life.&quot; The court added, &quot;Confinement in an institution severely diminishes the everyday life activities of individuals, including family relations, social contacts, work options, economic independence, educational advancement, and cultural enrichment.&quot;

Therefore, under Title II no person with a disability can be unjustly excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of services, programs or activities of any public entity.

===&quot;Michigan Paralyzed Veterans of America v. The University of Michigan&quot;===

&quot;Michigan Paralyzed Veterans of America v. The University of Michigan&quot; was a case filed before the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. It was filed on behalf of the Michigan Paralyzed Veterans of America against the University of Michigan claiming that Michigan Stadium violated the Americans with Disabilities Act in its $226-million renovation by failing to add enough seats for disabled fans or accommodate the needs for disabled restrooms, concessions and parking. Additionally, the distribution of the accessible seating was at issue, with nearly all the seats being provided in the end-zone areas. The U.S. Department of Justice assisted in the suit, which was settled in March 2008. The settlement required the stadium to add 329 wheelchair seats throughout the stadium by 2010, and an additional 135 accessible seats in clubhouses to go along with the existing 88 wheelchair seats. This case was significant because it set a precedent for the uniform distribution of accessible seating and gave the DOJ the opportunity to clarify previously unclear rules. The agreement now is a blueprint for all stadiums and other public facilities regarding accessibility.

===&quot;Paralyzed Veterans of America v. Ellerbe Becket Architects and Engineers&quot;===

One of the first major ADA lawsuits, &quot;Paralyzed Veterans of America v. Ellerbe Becket Architects and Engineers&quot; (PVA 1996) was focused on the wheelchair accessibility of a stadium project that was still in the design phase, MCI Center (now known as Capital One Arena) in Washington, D.C. Previous to this case, which was filed only five years after the ADA was passed, the DOJ was unable or unwilling to provide clarification on the distribution requirements for accessible wheelchair locations in large assembly spaces. While Section 4.33.3 of ADAAG makes reference to lines of sight, no specific reference is made to seeing over standing patrons. The MCI Center, designed by Ellerbe Becket Architects &amp; Engineers, was designed with too few wheelchair and companion seats, and the ones that were included did not provide sight lines that would enable the wheelchair user to view the playing area while the spectators in front of them were standing. This case and another related case established precedent on seat distribution and sight lines issues for ADA enforcement that continues to present day.

===&quot;Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams&quot;===

&quot;Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams&quot;, was a case in which the US Supreme Court interpreted the meaning of the phrase &quot;substantially impairs&quot; as used in the Americans with Disabilities Act. It reversed a Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals decision to grant partial summary judgment in favor of the respondent, Ella Williams, that classified her inability to perform manual job-related tasks as a disability. The Court held that the &quot;major life activity&quot; definition for evaluating the performance of manual tasks focuses the inquiry on whether Williams was unable to perform a range of tasks central to most people in carrying out the activities of daily living, not whether Williams was unable to perform her specific job tasks. Therefore, the determination of whether an impairment rises to the level of a disability is not limited to activities in the workplace solely, but rather to manual tasks in life in general. When the Supreme Court applied this standard, it found that the Court of Appeals had incorrectly determined the presence of a disability because it relied solely on her inability to perform specific manual work tasks, which was insufficient in proving the presence of a disability. The Court of Appeals should have taken into account the evidence presented that Williams retained the ability to do personal tasks and household chores, such activities being the nature of tasks most people do in their daily lives, and placed too much emphasis on her job disability. Since the evidence showed that Williams was performing normal daily tasks, it ruled that the Court of Appeals erred when it found that Williams was disabled. This ruling has since been legislatively overturned by the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA). In fact, Congress explicitly cited &quot;Toyota v. Williams&quot; in the text of the ADAAA itself as one of its driving influences for passing the ADAAA.

===&quot;US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett&quot;===
&quot;US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett&quot; was decided by the US Supreme Court in 2002. This case held that even requests for accommodation that might seem reasonable on their face, e.g., a transfer to a different position, can be rendered unreasonable because it would require a violation of the company&#x27;s seniority system. While the court held that, in general, a violation of a seniority system renders an otherwise reasonable accommodation unreasonable, a plaintiff can present evidence that, despite the seniority system, the accommodation is reasonable in the specific case at hand, e.g., the plaintiff could offer evidence that the seniority system is so often disregarded that another exception would not make a difference.

Importantly, the court held that the defendant need not provide proof that this particular application of the seniority system should prevail, and that, once the defendant showed that the accommodation violated the seniority system, it fell to Barnett to show it was nevertheless reasonable.

In this case, Barnett was a US Airways employee who injured his back, rendering him physically unable to perform his cargo-handling job. Invoking seniority, he transferred to a less-demanding mailroom job, but this position later became open to seniority-based bidding and was bid on by more senior employees. Barnett requested the accommodation of being allowed to stay on in the less-demanding mailroom job. US Airways denied his request, and he lost his job.

The Supreme Court decision invalidated both the approach of the district court, which found that the mere presence and importance of the seniority system was enough to warrant a summary judgment in favor of US Airways, as well as the circuit court&#x27;s approach that interpreted &#x27;reasonable accommodation&#x27; as &#x27;effective accommodation.&#x27;

===&quot;Access Now v. Southwest Airlines&quot;===

&quot;Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines Co.&quot; was a 2002 case where the District Court decided that the website of Southwest Airlines was not in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, because the ADA is concerned with things with a physical existence and thus cannot be applied to cyberspace. Judge Patricia A. Seitz found that the &quot;virtual ticket counter&quot; of the website was a virtual construct, and hence not a &quot;public place of accommodation&quot;. As such, &quot;To expand the ADA to cover &#x27;virtual&#x27; spaces would be to create new rights without well-defined standards.&quot;

===&quot;Ouellette v. Viacom International Inc.&quot;===

&quot;Ouellette v. Viacom International Inc.&quot; (2011) held that a mere online presence does not subject a website to the ADA guidelines. Thus Myspace and YouTube were not liable for a dyslexic man&#x27;s inability to navigate the site regardless of how impressive the &quot;online theater&quot; is.

===&quot;Authors Guild v. HathiTrust&quot;===

&quot;Authors Guild v. HathiTrust&quot; was a case in which the District Court decided that the HathiTrust digital library was a transformative, fair use of copyrighted works, making a large number of written text available to those with print disability.

===&quot;Zamora-Quezada v. HealthTexas Medical Group&quot;===
&quot;Zamora-Quezada v. HealthTexas Medical Group&quot; (begun in 1998) was the first time this act was used against HMOs when a novel lawsuit was filed by Texas attorney Robert Provan against five HMOs for their practice of revoking the contracts of doctors treating disabled patients. In 1999, these HMOs sought to dismiss Provan&#x27;s lawsuit, but a federal court ruled against them, and the case was settled out of court. Many decisions relating to Provan&#x27;s unique lawsuit against these HMOs have been cited in other court cases since.

===&quot;Campbell v. General Dynamics Government Systems Corp.&quot;===

&quot;Campbell v. General Dynamics Government Systems Corp.&quot; (2005) concerned the enforceability of a mandatory arbitration agreement contained in a dispute resolution policy linked to an e-mailed company-wide announcement, insofar as it applies to employment discrimination claims brought under the Americans with Disabilities Act.

===&quot;Tennessee v. Lane&quot;===

&quot;Tennessee v. Lane&quot;, 541 U.S. 509 (2004), was a case in the Supreme Court of the United States involving Congress&#x27;s enforcement powers under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. George Lane was unable to walk after a 1997 car accident in which he was accused of driving on the wrong side of the road. A woman was killed in the crash, and Lane faced misdemeanor charges of reckless driving. The suit was brought about because he was denied access to appear in criminal court because the courthouse had no elevator, even though the court was willing to carry him up the stairs and then willing to move the hearing to the first floor. He refused, citing he wanted to be treated as any other citizen, and was subsequently charged with failure to appear, after appearing at a previous hearing where he dragged himself up the stairs. The court ruled that Congress did have enough evidence that disabled people were being denied those fundamental rights that are protected by the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and had the enforcement powers under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. It further ruled that &quot;reasonable accommodations&quot; mandated by the ADA were not unduly burdensome and disproportionate to the harm.

===Gender dysphoria===
In 2022, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit stated that the ADA covers individuals with gender dysphoria, which may aid transgender people in accessing legal protections they otherwise may be unable to.

<text>The Apple Computer 1 (Apple-1), later known predominantly as the Apple I, is an 8-bit motherboard-only personal computer designed by Steve Wozniak and released by the Apple Computer Company (now Apple Inc.) in 1976. The company was initially formed to sell the Apple Iits first product and would later become the world&#x27;s largest technology company. The idea of starting a company and selling the computer came from Wozniak&#x27;s friend and Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. A differentiator of the Apple I was that it included video display terminal circuitry on its circuit board, allowing it to connect to a low-cost composite video monitor or television, whereas others avoided this and used more expensive monitors because business was used to more characters per displayed/typewritten line. It and the Sol-20 were some of the first home computers to have this capability.

To finance the Apple I&#x27;s development, Wozniak and Jobs sold some of their possessions for a few hundred dollars. Wozniak demonstrated the first prototype in July 1976 at the Homebrew Computer Club in Palo Alto, California, impressing the Byte Shop, an early computer retailer. After securing an order for 50 computers, Jobs was able to order the parts on credit and deliver the first Apple products after ten days.

The Apple I was one of the first computers available that used the inexpensive MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor. An expansion included a BASIC interpreter, allowing users to utilize BASIC at home instead of at institutions with mainframe computers, greatly lowering the entry cost for computing with BASIC.

Production was discontinued on September 30, 1977, after the June 10, 1977 introduction of its successor, the Apple II, which &quot;Byte&quot; magazine referred to as part of the &quot;1977 Trinity&quot; of personal computing (along with the PET 2001 from Commodore Business Machines and the TRS-80 Model I from Tandy Corporation). As relatively few computers were made before they were discontinued, coupled with their status as Apple&#x27;s first product, surviving Apple I units are now displayed in computer museums.

==History==
===Development===

In 1974, while visiting famous phone phreak John Draper in California, Steve Wozniak watched him connect a modem to the ARPANET – the precursor to the internet – and use a teleprinter to play chess with someone from Boston; this inspired him to make a cheap terminal that used an inexpensive keyboard from Sears and a standard TV. Later in March 1975, Wozniak started attending meetings of the Homebrew Computer Club, which was a major source of inspiration for him. New microcomputers such as the Altair 8800 inspired Wozniak to build a microprocessor into his video terminal circuit to make a complete computer. At the time the only appropriate CPUs available were the Intel 8080, and the Motorola 6800. Of these options, Wozniak preferred the 6800, though he was financially unable to obtain either. Instead, he began designing computers on paper until he could afford a CPU.

When the $25 MOS Technology 6502 was released in late 1975, Wozniak wrote a version of BASIC for it, then began to design a computer for it to run on. The 6502 was developed by many of the same engineers that designed the 6800, as many in Silicon Valley left employers to form their own companies. Wozniak&#x27;s earlier 6800 computer design needed only minor changes to run on the new processor.
By March 1, 1976, Wozniak completed the basic design of his computer. Wozniak originally offered the design to HP while working there, but it was rejected by the company on five occasions. When he demonstrated his computer at the Homebrew Computer Club, his friend and fellow club regular Steve Jobs was immediately interested in its commercial potential. Wozniak intended to share schematics of the machine for free; however, Jobs advised him to start a business together and sell bare printed circuit boards for the computer. Wozniak, at first skeptical, was later convinced by Jobs that even if they were not successful they could at least say to their grandchildren that they had had their own company. To raise the money they needed to build the first batch of the circuit boards, Wozniak sold his HP-65 scientific calculator while Jobs sold his Volkswagen van.
After the company was formed a month later, Jobs and Wozniak gave a presentation of the fully assembled &quot;Apple Computer A&quot; at the Homebrew Computer Club. Paul Terrell, who was starting a new computer shop in Mountain View, California, called the Byte Shop, saw the presentation and was impressed by the machine. Terrell told Jobs that he would order 50 units of the Apple I and pay $500 each on delivery, but only if they came fully assembledhe was not interested in buying bare printed circuit boards with no components.

Jobs took the purchase order from the Byte Shop to national electronic parts distributor Cramer Electronics, and ordered the components needed. When asked by the credit manager how he would pay for the parts, Jobs replied, &quot;I have this purchase order from the Byte Shop chain of computer stores for 50 of my computers and the payment terms are COD. If you give me the parts on net 30-day terms I can build and deliver the computers in that time frame, collect my money from Terrell at the Byte Shop and pay you.&quot;

To verify the purchase order, the credit manager called Paul Terrell, who assured him if the computers showed up, Jobs would have more than enough money for the parts order. The two Steves and their small crew spent day and night building and testing the computers, and delivered to Terrell on time. Terrell was surprised to receive a batch of assembled circuit boards, as he had expected complete computers with a case, monitor and keyboard. Nonetheless, he kept his word and paid the two Steves the money promised.
===Announcement and sales===

The Apple I went on sale in July 1976 at a price of . Wozniak later said he had no idea about the relation between the number and the number of the beast, and that he came up with the price because he liked &quot;repeating digits&quot; and because it was a one-third markup on the wholesale price. Jobs had managed to get the inventory into the nation&#x27;s first four storefront microcomputer retailers: Byte Shop (Palo Alto, California), itty bitty machine company (Evanston, Illinois), Data Domain (Bloomington, Indiana), and Computer Mart (New York City).

The first unit produced was used in a high school math class, and donated to Liza Loop&#x27;s public-access computer center. About 200 units were produced, and all but 25 were sold within nine or ten months.

In April 1977, the price was dropped to $475. It continued to be sold through August 1977, despite the introduction of the Apple II in April 1977, which began shipping in June of that year. In October 1977, the Apple I was officially discontinued and removed from Apple&#x27;s price list. As Wozniak was the only person who could answer most customer support questions about the computer, the company offered Apple I owners discounts and trade-ins for Apple IIs to persuade them to return their computers. These recovered boards were then destroyed by Apple, contributing to their later rarity.

Both Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak have stated that Apple did not assign serial numbers to the Apple l. Several boards have been found with numbered stickers affixed to them, which appear to be inspection stickers from the PCB manufacturer/assembler. A batch of boards is known to have numbers hand-written in black permanent marker on the back; these usually appear as &quot;01-00##&quot;. As of January 2022, 29 Apple-1s with a serial number are known. The highest known number is . Two original Apple-1s have been analyzed by Professional Sports Authenticator in Los Angeles, concluding that the serial numbers had been hand-written by Steve Jobs.

==Hardware==

The Apple I used a MOS Technologies 6502 microprocessor running at , and its design was based largely on Wozniak&#x27;s previous work centered around a Motorola 6800. The unconventional clock speed was chosen to be a fraction () of the NTSC color carrier, which simplified video circuitry. of memory was included on the base machine, which was expandable to on-board and up to by using an add-on card. On-board memory utilized newly available 4Kbit DRAM chips, and was designed to be upgradeable to the next generation of 16Kbit chips for a maximum of on-board memory. An optional $75 plug-in cassette interface card allowed users to store programs on ordinary audio cassette tapes. A BASIC interpreter, originally written by Wozniak, was provided with the cassette interface that let users easily write programs and play simple games. An onboard AC power supply was included.

The Apple I did not come with a case. It could be used bare, though some users chose to build custom (typically wooden) enclosures.

===Video and Input===
The Apple I included built-in computer terminal circuitry with composite video output. To use the computer, a user-supplied composite monitor and ASCII-encoded keyboard needed to be connected. If a monitor was not available, a standard television set could be used along with an RF modulator. In comparison, competing machines generally required an expensive dedicated video display terminal or teletypewriter. This, combined with its single-board construction, made the Apple I an elegant and inexpensive machine for its day, though competitors such as the Sol-20 and Sphere 1 offered similar feature sets.
The computer generated its video output using a shift register memory and a Signetics 2513 64×8×5 Character Generator. It was capable of displaying uppercase characters, numbers and basic punctuation and math symbols with a 5x8 pixel font:


===Apple Cassette Interface expansion===

A cassette interface was available in the form of an optional add-on for the Apple I&#x27;s expansion slot. A cassette deck plugged in to the expansion&#x27;s phone connector ports could be written to and read from as a form of removable storage. The only alternative to the interface for loading programs was typing machine code by hand, making the add-on &quot;ubiquitous&quot;.

The expansion came with a free cassette tape containing Steve Wozniak&#x27;s Integer BASIC interpreter. Other software tapes were supplied &quot;at minimal cost&quot; including ported video games such as &quot;Hamurabi&quot;, &quot;Lunar Lander&quot; and &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

==Conservation==

Only about 200 Apple I boards were produced, and the whereabouts of 62 to 82 are known. After the success of the Apple II, and of Apple broadly, the Apple I was recognized as an important historical computer. According to the 1986 &quot;Apple IIe Owner&#x27;s Guide&quot;, an Apple I was then worth &quot;between $10,000 and $15,000&quot; and a board was reportedly sold for $50,000 in 1999.

In November 2010, an Apple I with a cache of original documents and packaging sold for £133,250 ($) at Christie&#x27;s auction house in London. The documents included the return label showing Steve Jobs&#x27;s parents&#x27; address, a personally typed and signed letter from Jobs (answering technical questions about the computer), and the invoice (listing &quot;Steven&quot; as the salesman). The computer was brought to Polytechnic University of Turin for restoration.

In October 2014 the Henry Ford Museum purchased an Apple I at a Bonhams auction for . The sale included the keyboard, monitor, cassette decks and a manual. In 2017, an Apple I removed from Steve Jobs&#x27;s office in 1985 by Apple quality control engineer Don Hutmacher was placed on display at Living Computers: Museum + Labs.

On May 30, 2015, an elderly woman reportedly dropped off boxes of electronics for disposal at an electronics recycling center in the Silicon Valley of Northern California. Included in the electronics (removed from her garage after the death of her husband) was an original Apple I computer, which the recycling firm sold for . When a discarded item is sold, it is the company&#x27;s practice to give 50% of the proceeds to the original owner, but the woman has not been identified.

Apple I computers with original documents and memorabilia have frequently been auctioned for over $300,000 throughout the 2010s and 2020s. The production prototype for the Apple I survives in a badly damaged state and was itself auctioned in 2022 for $677,196.

===Replicas===

Several Apple I clones and replicas have been released in recent years. These are created by hobbyists and marketed to the hobbyist/collector community. Availability is usually limited to small runs in response to demand.

===Emulation===
Emulation software for the Apple I has been written for modern home computers and for web browsers. It has also been emulated on 1980s era computers including the SAM Coupé and Commodore 64.

<text>Apatosaurus (; meaning &quot;deceptive lizard&quot;) is a genus of herbivorous sauropod dinosaur that lived in North America during the Late Jurassic period. Othniel Charles Marsh described and named the first-known species, A. ajax, in 1877, and a second species, A. louisae, was discovered and named by William H. Holland in 1916. &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; lived about 152 to 151 million years ago (mya), during the late Kimmeridgian to early Tithonian age, and are now known from fossils in the Morrison Formation of modern-day Colorado, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Wyoming, and Utah in the United States. &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; had an average length of , and an average mass of . A few specimens indicate a maximum length of 11–30% greater than average and a mass of approximately .

The cervical vertebrae of &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; are less elongated and more heavily constructed than those of &quot;Diplodocus&quot;, a diplodocid like &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;, and the bones of the leg are much stockier despite being longer, implying that &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; was a more robust animal. The tail was held above the ground during normal locomotion. &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; had a single claw on each forelimb and three on each hindlimb. The &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; skull, long thought to be similar to &quot;Camarasaurus&quot;, is much more similar to that of &quot;Diplodocus&quot;. &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; was a generalized browser that likely held its head elevated. To lighten its vertebrae, &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; had air sacs that made the bones internally full of holes. Like that of other diplodocids, its tail may have been used as a whip to create loud noises, or, as more recently suggested, as a sensory organ.

The skull of &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; was confused with that of &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; and &quot;Brachiosaurus&quot; until 1909, when the holotype of &quot;A. louisae&quot; was found, and a complete skull just a few meters away from the front of the neck. Henry Fairfield Osborn disagreed with this association, and went on to mount a skeleton of &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; with a &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; skull cast. &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; skeletons were mounted with speculative skull casts until 1970, when McIntosh showed that more robust skulls assigned to &quot;Diplodocus&quot; were more likely from &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;.

&quot;Apatosaurus&quot; is a genus in the family Diplodocidae. It is one of the more basal genera, with only &quot;Amphicoelias&quot; and possibly a new, unnamed genus more primitive. Although the subfamily Apatosaurinae was named in 1929, the group was not used validly until an extensive 2015 study. Only &quot;Brontosaurus&quot; is also in the subfamily, with the other genera being considered synonyms or reclassified as diplodocines. &quot;Brontosaurus&quot; has long been considered a junior synonym of &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;; its type species was reclassified as &quot;A.excelsus&quot; in 1903. A 2015 study concluded that &quot;Brontosaurus&quot; is a valid genus of sauropod distinct from &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;, but not all paleontologists agree with this division. As it existed in North America during the late Jurassic, &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; would have lived alongside dinosaurs such as &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, &quot;Camarasaurus&quot;, &quot;Diplodocus&quot;, and &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;.

==Description==

&quot;Apatosaurus&quot; was a large, long-necked, quadrupedal animal with a long, whip-like tail. Its forelimbs were slightly shorter than its hindlimbs. Most size estimates are based on specimen CM3018, the type specimen of &quot;A.louisae&quot;, reaching in length and in body mass. A 2015 study that estimated the mass of volumetric models of &quot;Dreadnoughtus&quot;, &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Giraffatitan&quot; estimates CM3018 at , similar in mass to &quot;Dreadnoughtus&quot;. Some specimens of &quot;A.ajax&quot; (such as OMNH1670) represent individuals 1130% longer, suggesting masses twice that of CM3018 or , potentially rivaling the largest titanosaurs. However, the upper size estimate of OMNH1670 is likely an exaggeration, with the size estimates revised in 2020 at in length and in body mass based on volumetric analysis.

The skull is small in relation to the size of the animal. The jaws are lined with spatulate (chisel-like) teeth suited to an herbivorous diet. The snout of &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; and similar diplodocoids is squared, with only &quot;Nigersaurus&quot; having a squarer skull. The braincase of &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; is well preserved in specimen BYU17096, which also preserved much of the skeleton. A phylogenetic analysis found that the braincase had a morphology similar to those of other diplodocoids. Some skulls of &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; have been found still in articulation with their teeth. Those teeth that have the enamel surface exposed do not show any scratches on the surface; instead, they display a sugary texture and little wear.

Like those of other sauropods, the neck vertebrae are deeply bifurcated; they carried neural spines with a large trough in the middle, resulting in a wide, deep neck. The vertebral formula for the holotype of &quot;A.louisae&quot; is 15cervicals, 10dorsals, 5sacrals, and 82caudals. The caudal vertebra number may vary, even within species. The cervical vertebrae of &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; and &quot;Brontosaurus&quot; are stouter and more robust than those of other diplodocids and were found to be most similar to &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; by Charles Whitney Gilmore. In addition, they support cervical ribs that extend farther towards the ground than in diplodocines, and have vertebrae and ribs that are narrower towards the top of the neck, making the neck nearly triangular in cross-section. In &quot;Apatosaurus louisae&quot;, the atlas-axis complex of the first cervicals is nearly fused. The dorsal ribs are not fused or tightly attached to their vertebrae and are instead loosely articulated. &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; has ten dorsal ribs on either side of the body. The large neck was filled with an extensive system of weight-saving air sacs. &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;, like its close relative &quot;Supersaurus&quot;, has tall neural spines, which make up more than half the height of the individual bones of its vertebrae. The shape of the tail is unusual for a diplodocid; it is comparatively slender because of the rapidly decreasing height of the vertebral spines with increasing distance from the hips. &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; also had very long ribs compared to most other diplodocids, giving it an unusually deep chest. As in other diplodocids, the tail transformed into a whip-like structure towards the end.

The limb bones are also very robust. Within Apatosaurinae, the scapula of &quot;Apatosaurus louisae&quot; is intermediate in morphology between those of &quot;A.ajax&quot; and &quot;Brontosaurus excelsus&quot;. The arm bones are stout, so the humerus of &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; resembles that of &quot;Camarasaurus&quot;, as well as &quot;Brontosaurus&quot;. However, the humeri of &quot;Brontosaurus&quot; and &quot;A.ajax&quot; are more similar to each other than they are to &quot;A.louisae&quot;. In 1936, Charles Gilmore noted that previous reconstructions of &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; forelimbs erroneously proposed that the radius and ulna could cross; in life they would have remained parallel. &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; had a single large claw on each forelimb, a feature shared by all sauropods more derived than &quot;Shunosaurus&quot;. The first three toes had claws on each hindlimb. The phalangeal formula is 2-1-1-1-1, meaning the innermost finger (phalanx) on the forelimb has two bones and the next has one. The single manual claw bone (ungual) is slightly curved and squarely truncated on the anterior end. The pelvic girdle includes the robust ilia, and the fused (co-ossified) pubes and ischia. The femora of &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; are very stout and represent some of the most robust femora of any member of Sauropoda. The tibia and fibula bones are different from the slender bones of &quot;Diplodocus&quot; but are nearly indistinguishable from those of &quot;Camarasaurus&quot;. The fibula is longer and slenderer than the tibia. The foot of &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; has three claws on the innermost digits; the digit formula is 3-4-5-3-2. The first metatarsal is the stoutest, a feature shared among diplodocids.

==Discovery and species==
=== Initial discovery ===

The first &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; fossils were discovered by Arthur Lakes, a local miner, and his friend Henry C. Beckwith in the spring of 1877 in Morrison, a town in the eastern foothills of the Rocky Mountains in Jefferson County, Colorado. Arthur Lakes wrote to Othniel Charles Marsh, Professor of Paleontology at Yale University, and Edward Drinker Cope, a paleontologist based in Philadelphia, about the discovery until eventually collecting several fossils and sending them to both paleontologists. Marsh named &quot;Atlantosaurus montanus&quot; based on some of the fossils sent and hired Lakes to collect the rest of the material at Morrison and send it to Yale, while Cope attempted to hire Lakes as well but was rejected. One of the best specimens collected by Lakes in 1877 was a well preserved partial postcranial skeleton, including many vertebrae, and a partial braincase (YPM VP 1860), which was sent to Marsh and named &quot;Apatosaurus ajax&quot; in November 1877. The composite term &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; comes from the Greek words &#x27; ()/&#x27; () meaning &quot;deception&quot;/&quot;deceptive&quot;, and &quot;&quot; () meaning &quot;lizard&quot;; thus, &quot;deceptive lizard&quot;. Marsh gave it this name based on the chevron bones, which are dissimilar to those of other dinosaurs; instead, the chevron bones of &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; showed similarities with those of mosasaurs, most likely that of the representative species &quot;Mosasaurus&quot;. By the end of excavations at Lakes&#x27; quarry in Morrison, several partial specimens of &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; had been collected, but only the type specimen of &quot;A. ajax&quot; can be confidently referred to the species.

During excavation and transportation, the bones of the holotype skeleton were mixed with those of another Apatosaurine individual originally described as &quot;Atlantosaurus immanis&quot;; as a consequence, some elements cannot be ascribed to either specimen with confidence. Marsh distinguished the new genus &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; from &quot;Atlantosaurus&quot; on the basis of the number of sacral vertebrae, with &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; possessing three and &quot;Atlantosaurus&quot; four. Recent research shows that traits usually used to distinguish taxa at this time were actually widespread across several taxa, causing many of the taxa named to be invalid, like &quot;Atlantosaurus&quot;. Two years later, Marsh announced the discovery of a larger and more complete specimen (YPM VP 1980) from Como Bluff, Wyoming, he gave this specimen the name &quot;Brontosaurus excelsus&quot;. Also at Como Bluff, the Hubbell brothers working for Edward Drinker Cope collected a tibia, fibula, scapula, and several caudal vertebrae along with other fragments belonging to &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; in 1877–78 at Cope&#x27;s Quarry 5 at the site. Later in 1884, Othniel Marsh named &quot;Diplodocus lacustris&quot; based on a chimeric partial dentary, snout, and several teeth collected by Lakes in 1877 at Morrison. In 2013, it was suggested that the dentary of &quot;D. lacustris&quot; and its teeth were actually from &quot;Apatosaurus ajax&quot; based on its proximity to the type braincase of &quot;A. ajax&quot;. All specimens currently considered &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; were from the Morrison Formation, the location of the excavations of Marsh and Cope.

=== Second Dinosaur Rush and skull issue ===
After the end of the Bone Wars, many major institutions in the eastern United States were inspired by the depictions and finds by Marsh and Cope to assemble their own dinosaur fossil collections. The competition to mount the first sauropod skeleton specifically was the most intense, with the American Museum of Natural History, Carnegie Museum of Natural History, and Field Museum of Natural History all sending expeditions to the west to find the most complete sauropod specimen, bring it back to the home institution, and mount it in their fossil halls. The American Museum of Natural History was the first to launch an expedition, finding a well preserved skeleton (AMNH 460), which is occasionally assigned to &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;, is considered nearly complete; only the head, feet, and sections of the tail are missing, and it was the first sauropod skeleton mounted. The specimen was found north of Medicine Bow, Wyoming, in 1898 by Walter Granger, and took the entire summer to extract. To complete the mount, sauropod feet that were discovered at the same quarry and a tail fashioned to appear as Marsh believed it shouldbut which had too few vertebraewere added. In addition, a sculpted model of what the museum thought the skull of this massive creature might look like was made. This was not a delicate skull like that of &quot;Diplodocus&quot;which was later found to be more accuratebut was based on &quot;the biggest, thickest, strongest skull bones, lower jaws and tooth crowns from three different quarries&quot;. These skulls were likely those of &quot;Camarasaurus&quot;, the only other sauropod for which good skull material was known at the time. The mount construction was overseen by Adam Hermann, who failed to find &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; skulls. Hermann was forced to sculpt a stand-in skull by hand. Osborn said in a publication that the skull was &quot;largely conjectural and based on that of &quot;Morosaurus&quot;&quot; (now &quot;Camarasaurus&quot;).
In 1903, Elmer Riggs published a study that described a well-preserved skeleton of a diplodocid from the Grand River Valley near Fruita, Colorado, Field Museum of Natural History specimen P25112. Riggs thought that the deposits were similar in age to those of the Como Bluff in Wyoming from which Marsh had described &quot;Brontosaurus&quot;. Most of the skeleton was found, and after comparison with both &quot;Brontosaurus&quot; and &quot;Apatosaurus ajax&quot;, Riggs realized that the holotype of &quot;A.ajax&quot; was immature, and thus the features distinguishing the genera were not valid. Since &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; was the earlier name, &quot;Brontosaurus&quot; should be considered a junior synonym of &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;. Because of this, Riggs recombined &quot;Brontosaurus excelsus&quot; as &quot;Apatosaurus excelsus&quot;. Based on comparisons with other species proposed to belong to &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;, Riggs also determined that the Field Columbian Museum specimen was likely most similar to &quot;A.excelsus&quot;.

Despite Riggs&#x27; publication, Henry Fairfield Osborn, who was a strong opponent of Marsh and his taxa, labeled the &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; mount of the American Museum of Natural History &quot;Brontosaurus&quot;. Because of this decision the name &quot;Brontosaurus&quot; was commonly used outside of scientific literature for what Riggs considered &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;, and the museum&#x27;s popularity meant that &quot;Brontosaurus&quot; became one of the best known dinosaurs, even though it was invalid throughout nearly all of the 20th and early 21st centuries.

It was not until 1909 that an &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; skull was found during the first expedition, led by Earl Douglass, to what would become known as the Carnegie Quarry at Dinosaur National Monument. The skull was found a short distance from a skeleton (specimen CM3018) identified as the new species &quot;Apatosaurus louisae&quot;, named after Louise Carnegie, wife of Andrew Carnegie, who funded field research to find complete dinosaur skeletons in the American West. The skull was designated CM11162; it was very similar to the skull of &quot;Diplodocus&quot;. Another smaller skeleton of &quot;A.louisae&quot; was found nearby CM11162 and CM3018. The skull was accepted as belonging to the &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; specimen by Douglass and Carnegie Museum director William H. Holland, although other scientistsmost notably Osbornrejected this identification. Holland defended his view in 1914 in an address to the Paleontological Society of America, yet he left the Carnegie Museum mount headless. While some thought Holland was attempting to avoid conflict with Osborn, others suspected Holland was waiting until an articulated skull and neck were found to confirm the association of the skull and skeleton. After Holland&#x27;s death in 1934, museum staff placed a cast of a &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; skull on the mount.

While most other museums were using cast or sculpted &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; skulls on &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; mounts, the Yale Peabody Museum decided to sculpt a skull based on the lower jaw of a &quot;Camarasaurus&quot;, with the cranium based on Marsh&#x27;s 1891 illustration of the skull. The skull also included forward-pointing nasalssomething unusual for any dinosaurand fenestrae differing from both the drawing and other skulls.

No &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; skull was mentioned in literature until the 1970s when John Stanton McIntosh and David Berman redescribed the skulls of &quot;Diplodocus&quot; and &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;. They found that though he never published his opinion, Holland was almost certainly correct, that &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; had a &quot;Diplodocus&quot;-like skull. According to them, many skulls long thought to pertain to &quot;Diplodocus&quot; might instead be those of &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;. They reassigned multiple skulls to &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; based on associated and closely associated vertebrae. Even though they supported Holland, it was noted that &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; might have possessed a &quot;Camarasaurus&quot;-like skull, based on a disarticulated &quot;Camarasaurus&quot;-like tooth found at the precise site where an &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; specimen was found years before. On October20, 1979, after the publications by McIntosh and Berman, the first true skull of &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; was mounted on a skeleton in a museum, that of the Carnegie. In 1998, it was suggested that the Felch Quarry skull that Marsh had included in his 1896 skeletal restoration instead belonged to &quot;Brachiosaurus&quot;. This was supported in 2020 with a redescription of the brachiosaurid material found at the Felch Quarry.

=== Recent discoveries and reassessment ===
In 2011, the first specimen of &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; where a skull was found articulated with its cervical vertebrae was described. This specimen, CMCVP7180, was found to differ in both skull and neck features from &quot;A.louisae&quot;, but shared many features of the cervical vertebrae with &quot;A.ajax&quot;. Another well-preserved skull is Brigham Young University specimen 17096, a well-preserved skull and skeleton, with a preserved braincase. The specimen was found in Cactus Park Quarry in western Colorado. In 2013, Matthew Mossbrucker and several other authors published an abstract that described a premaxilla and maxilla from Lakes&#x27; original quarry in Morrison and referred the material to &quot;Apatosaurus ajax.&quot; 

Almost all modern paleontologists agreed with Riggs that the two dinosaurs should be classified together in a single genus. According to the rules of the ICZN (which governs the scientific names of animals), the name &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;, having been published first, has priority as the official name; &quot;Brontosaurus&quot; was considered a junior synonym and was therefore long discarded from formal use. Despite this, at least one paleontologistRobert T. Bakkerargued in the 1990s that &quot;A.ajax&quot; and &quot;A.excelsus&quot; were in fact sufficiently distinct for the latter to merit a separate genus.

In 2015, Emanuel Tschopp, Octávio Mateus, and Roger Benson released a paper on diplodocoid systematics, and proposed that genera could be diagnosed by thirteen differing characters, and species separated based on six. The minimum number for generic separation was chosen based on the fact that &quot;A.ajax&quot; and &quot;A.louisae&quot; differ in twelve characters, and &quot;Diplodocus carnegiei&quot; and &quot;D.hallorum&quot; differ in eleven characters. Thus, thirteen characters were chosen to validate the separation of genera. The six differing features for specific separation were chosen by counting the number of differing features in separate specimens generally agreed to represent one species, with only one differing character in &quot;D.carnegiei&quot; and &quot;A.louisae&quot;, but five differing features in &quot;B.excelsus&quot;. Therefore, Tschopp etal. argued that &quot;Apatosaurus excelsus&quot;, originally classified as &quot;Brontosaurus excelsus&quot;, had enough morphological differences from other species of &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; that it warranted being reclassified as a separate genus again. The conclusion was based on a comparison of 477 morphological characteristics across 81 different dinosaur individuals. Among the many notable differences are the widerand presumably strongerneck of &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; species compared to &quot;B.excelsus&quot;. Other species previously assigned to &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;, such as &quot;Elosaurus parvus&quot; and &quot;Eobrontosaurus yahnahpin&quot; were also reclassified as &quot;Brontosaurus&quot;. Some features proposed to separate &quot;Brontosaurus&quot; from &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; include: posterior dorsal vertebrae with the centrum longer than wide; the scapula rear to the acromial edge and the distal blade being excavated; the acromial edge of the distal scapular blade bearing a rounded expansion; and the ratio of the proximodistal length to transverse breadth of the astragalus 0.55 or greater. Sauropod expert Michael D&#x27;Emic pointed out that the criteria chosen were to an extent arbitrary and that they would require abandoning the name &quot;Brontosaurus&quot; again if newer analyzes obtained different results. Mammal paleontologist Donald Prothero criticized the mass media reaction to this study as superficial and premature, concluding that he would keep &quot;Brontosaurus&quot; in quotes and not treat the name as a valid genus.

===Valid species===

Many species of &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; have been designated from scant material. Marsh named as many species as he could, which resulted in many being based upon fragmentary and indistinguishable remains. In 2005, Paul Upchurch and colleagues published a study that analyzed the species and specimen relationships of &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;. They found that &quot;A.louisae&quot; was the most basal species, followed by FMNHP25112, and then a polytomy of &quot;A.ajax&quot;, &quot;A.parvus&quot;, and &quot;A.excelsus&quot;. Their analysis was revised and expanded with many additional diplodocid specimens in 2015, which resolved the relationships of &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; slightly differently, and also supported separating &quot;Brontosaurus&quot; from &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;.

*Apatosaurus ajax was named by Marsh in 1877 after Ajax, a hero from Greek mythology. Marsh designated the incomplete, juvenile skeleton YPM1860 as its holotype. The species is less studied than &quot;Brontosaurus&quot; and &quot;A.louisae&quot;, especially because of the incomplete nature of the holotype. In 2005, many specimens in addition to the holotype were found assignable to &quot;A.ajax&quot;, YPM1840, NSMT-PV 20375, YPM1861, and AMNH460. The specimens date from the late Kimmeridgian to the early Tithonian ages. In 2015, only the &quot;A.ajax&quot; holotype YPM1860 assigned to the species, with AMNH460 found either to be within &quot;Brontosaurus&quot;, or potentially its own taxon. However, YPM1861 and NSMT-PV 20375 only differed in a few characteristics, and cannot be distinguished specifically or generically from &quot;A.ajax&quot;. YPM1861 is the holotype of &quot;&quot;Atlantosaurus&quot; immanis&quot;, which means it might be a junior synonym of &quot;A.ajax&quot;.
*Apatosaurus louisae was named by Holland in 1916, being first known from a partial skeleton that was found in Utah. The holotype is CM3018, with referred specimens including CM3378, CM11162, and LACM52844. The former two consist of a vertebral column; the latter two consist of a skull and a nearly complete skeleton, respectively. &quot;Apatosaurus louisae&quot; specimens all come from the late Kimmeridgian of Dinosaur National Monument. In 2015, Tschopp etal. found the type specimen of &quot;Apatosaurus laticollis&quot; to nest closely with CM3018, meaning the former is likely a junior synonym of &quot;A.louisae&quot;.

The cladogram below is the result of an analysis by Tschopp, Mateus, and Benson (2015). The authors analyzed most diplodocid type specimens separately to deduce which specimen belonged to which species and genus.

===Reassigned species===

* &quot;Apatosaurus grandis&quot; was named in 1877 by Marsh in the article that described &quot;A.ajax&quot;. It was briefly described, figured, and diagnosed. Marsh later mentioned it was only provisionally assigned to &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; when he reassigned it to his new genus &quot;Morosaurus&quot; in 1878. Since &quot;Morosaurus&quot; has been considered a synonym of &quot;Camarasaurus&quot;, &quot;C.grandis&quot; is the oldest-named species of the latter genus.
* &quot;Apatosaurus excelsus&quot; was the original type species of &quot;Brontosaurus&quot;, first named by Marsh in 1879. Elmer Riggs reclassified &quot;Brontosaurus&quot; as a synonym of &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; in 1903, transferring the species &quot;B.excelsus&quot; to &quot;A.excelsus&quot;. In 2015, Tschopp, Mateus, and Benson argued that the species was distinct enough to be placed in its own genus, so they reclassified it back into &quot;Brontosaurus&quot;.
* &quot;Apatosaurus parvus&quot;, first described from a juvenile specimen as &quot;Elosaurus&quot; in 1902 by Peterson and Gilmore, was reassigned to &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; in 1994, and then to &quot;Brontosaurus&quot; in 2015. Many other, more mature specimens were assigned to it following the 2015 study.
* &quot;Apatosaurus minimus&quot; was originally described as a specimen of &quot;Brontosaurus&quot; sp. in 1904 by Osborn. In 1917, Henry Mook named it as its own species, &quot;A.minimus&quot;, for a pair of ilia and their sacrum. In 2012, Mike P. Taylor and Matt J. Wedel published a short abstract describing the material of &quot;A. minimus&quot;, finding it hard to place among either Diplodocoidea or Macronaria. While it was placed with &quot;Saltasaurus&quot; in a phylogenetic analysis, it was thought to represent instead some form with convergent features from many groups. The study of Tschopp etal. did find that a camarasaurid position for the taxon was supported, but noted that the position of the taxon was found to be highly variable and there was no clearly more likely position.
* &quot;Apatosaurus alenquerensis&quot; was named in 1957 by Albert-Félix de Lapparent and Georges Zbyweski. It was based on post cranial material from Portugal. In 1990, this material was reassigned to &quot;Camarasaurus&quot;, but in 1998 it was given its own genus, &quot;Lourinhasaurus&quot;. This was further supported by the findings of Tschopp etal. in 2015, where &quot;Lourinhasaurus&quot; was found to be sister to &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; and other camarasaurids.
* &quot;Apatosaurus yahnahpin&quot; was named by James Filla and Patrick Redman in 1994. Bakker made &quot;A.yahnahpin&quot; the type species of a new genus, &quot;Eobrontosaurus&quot; in 1998, and Tschopp reclassified it as &quot;Brontosaurus yahnahpin&quot; in 2015.

==Classification==

&quot;Apatosaurus&quot; is a member of the family Diplodocidae, a clade of gigantic sauropod dinosaurs. The family includes some of the longest creatures ever to walk the earth, including &quot;Diplodocus&quot;, &quot;Supersaurus&quot;, and &quot;Barosaurus&quot;. &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; is sometimes classified in the subfamily Apatosaurinae, which may also include &quot;Suuwassea&quot;, &quot;Supersaurus&quot;, and &quot;Brontosaurus&quot;. Othniel Charles Marsh described &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; as allied to &quot;Atlantosaurus&quot; within the now-defunct group Atlantosauridae. In 1878, Marsh raised his family to the rank of suborder, including &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;, &quot;Atlantosaurus&quot;, &quot;Morosaurus&quot; (=&quot;Camarasaurus&quot;) and &quot;Diplodocus&quot;. He classified this group within Sauropoda, a group he erected in the same study. In 1903, Elmer S. Riggs said the name Sauropoda would be a junior synonym of earlier names; he grouped &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; within Opisthocoelia. Sauropoda is still used as the group name. In 2011, John Whitlock published a study that placed &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; a more basal diplodocid, sometimes less basal than &quot;Supersaurus&quot;.

==Paleobiology==

It was believed throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries that sauropods like &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; were too massive to support their own weight on dry land. It was theorized that they lived partly submerged in water, perhaps in swamps. More recent findings do not support this; sauropods are now thought to have been fully terrestrial animals. A study of diplodocid snouts showed that the square snout, large proportion of pits, and fine, subparallel scratches of the teeth of &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; suggests it was a ground-height, nonselective browser. It may have eaten ferns, cycadeoids, seed ferns, horsetails, and algae. Stevens and Parish (2005) speculate that these sauropods fed from riverbanks on submerged water plants.

A 2015 study of the necks of &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; and &quot;Brontosaurus&quot; found many differences between them and other diplodocids, and that these variations may have shown that the necks of &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; and &quot;Brontosaurus&quot; were used for intraspecific combat. Various uses for the single claw on the forelimb of sauropods have been proposed. One suggestion is that they were used for defense, but their shape and size make this unlikely. It was also possible they were for feeding, but the most probable use for the claw was grasping objects such as tree trunks when rearing.

Trackways of sauropods like &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; show that they may have had a range of around per day, and that they could potentially have reached a top speed of per hour. The slow locomotion of sauropods may be due to their minimal muscling, or to recoil after strides. A trackway of a juvenile has led some to believe that they were capable of bipedalism, though this is disputed.

===Neck posture===
Diplodocids like &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; are often portrayed with their necks held high up in the air, allowing them to browse on tall trees. Some studies state diplodocid necks were less flexible than previously believed, because the structure of the neck vertebrae would not have allowed the neck to bend far upward, and that sauropods like &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; were adapted to low browsing or ground feeding.

Other studies by Taylor find that all tetrapods appear to hold their necks at the maximum possible vertical extension when in a normal, alert posture; they argue the same would hold true for sauropods barring any unknown, unique characteristics that set the soft tissue anatomy of their necks apart from that of other animals. &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;, like &quot;Diplodocus&quot;, would have held its neck angled upward with the head pointing downward in a resting posture. Kent Stevens and Michael Parrish (1999 and 2005) state &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; had a great feeding range; its neck could bend into a U-shape laterally. The neck&#x27;s range of movement would have also allowed the head to feed at the level of the feet.

Matthew Cobley &quot;et al.&quot; (2013) dispute this, finding that large muscles and cartilage would have limited movement of the neck. They state the feeding ranges for sauropods like &quot;Diplodocus&quot; were smaller than previously believed, and the animals may have had to move their whole bodies around to better access areas where they could browse vegetation. As such, they might have spent more time foraging to meet their minimum energy needs. The conclusions of Cobley &quot;etal.&quot; are disputed by Taylor, who analyzed the amount and positioning of intervertebral cartilage to determine the flexibility of the neck of &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; and &quot;Diplodocus&quot;. He found that the neck of &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; was very flexible.

===Physiology===

Given the large body mass and long neck of sauropods like &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;, physiologists have encountered problems determining how these animals breathed. Beginning with the assumption that, like crocodilians, &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; did not have a diaphragm, the dead-space volume (the amount of unused air remaining in the mouth, trachea, and air tubes after each breath) has been estimated at for a specimen. Paladino calculates its tidal volume (the amount of air moved in or out during a single breath) at with an avian respiratory system, if mammalian, and if reptilian.

On this basis, its respiratory system would likely have been parabronchi, with multiple pulmonary air sacs as in avian lungs, and a flow-through lung. An avian respiratory system would need a lung volume of about compared with a mammalian requirement of , which would exceed the space available. The overall thoracic volume of &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; has been estimated at , allowing for a , four-chambered heart and a lung capacity. That would allow about for the necessary tissue. Evidence for the avian system in &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; and other sauropods is also present in the pneumaticity of the vertebrae. Though this plays a role in reducing the weight of the animal, Wedel (2003) states they are also likely connected to air sacs, as in birds.

James Spotila &quot;et al.&quot; (1991) concludes that the large body size of sauropods would have made them unable to maintain high metabolic rates because they would not have been able to release enough heat. They assumed sauropods had a reptilian respiratory system. Wedel says that an avian system would have allowed it to dump more heat. Some scientists state that the heart would have had trouble sustaining sufficient blood pressure to oxygenate the brain. Others suggest that the near-horizontal posture of the head and neck would have eliminated the problem of supplying blood to the brain because it would not have been elevated.

James Farlow (1987) calculates that an &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;-sized dinosaur about would have possessed of fermentation contents, though he cautions that the regression equation being used is based on living mammals which are much smaller and physiologically different. Assuming &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; had an avian respiratory system and a reptilian resting-metabolism, Frank Paladino etal. (1997) estimate the animal would have needed to consume only about of water per day.

===Growth===

A 1999 microscopic study of &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; and &quot;Brontosaurus&quot; bones concluded the animals grew rapidly when young and reached near-adult sizes in about 10years. In 2008, a study on the growth rates of sauropods was published by Thomas Lehman and Holly Woodward. They said that by using growth lines and length-to-mass ratios, &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; would have grown to 25t (25 long tons; 28 short tons) in 15years, with growth peaking at in a single year. An alternative method, using limb length and body mass, found &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; grew per year, and reached its full mass before it was about 70years old. These estimates have been called unreliable because the calculation methods are not sound; old growth lines would have been obliterated by bone remodeling. One of the first identified growth factors of &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; was the number of sacral vertebrae, which increased to five by the time of the creature&#x27;s maturity. This was first noted in 1903 and again in 1936.

Long-bone histology enables researchers to estimate the age that a specific individual reached. A study by Eva Griebeler etal. (2013) examined long-bone histological data and concluded the &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; sp.SMA0014 weighed , reached sexual maturity at 21years, and died aged 28. The same growth model indicated &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; sp.BYU 601–17328 weighed , reached sexual maturity at 19years, and died aged 31.

====Juveniles====
Compared with most sauropods, a relatively large amount of juvenile material is known from &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;. Multiple specimens in the OMNH are from juveniles of an undetermined species of &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;; this material includes partial shoulder and pelvic girdles, some vertebrae, and limb bones. OMNH juvenile material is from at least two different age groups and based on overlapping bones likely comes from more than three individuals. The specimens exhibit features that distinguish &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; from its relatives, and thus likely belong to the genus. Juvenile sauropods tend to have proportionally shorter necks and tails, and a more pronounced forelimb-hindlimb disparity than found in adult sauropods.

===Tail===

An article published in 1997 reported research of the mechanics of &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; tails by Nathan Myhrvold and paleontologist Philip J. Currie. Myhrvold carried out a computer simulation of the tail, which in diplodocids like &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; was a very long, tapering structure resembling a bullwhip. This computer modeling suggested diplodocids were capable of producing a whiplike cracking sound of over 200 decibels, comparable to the volume of a cannon being fired.

A pathology has been identified on the tail of &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;, caused by a growth defect. Two caudal vertebrae are seamlessly fused along the entire articulating surface of the bone, including the arches of the neural spines. This defect might have been caused by the lack or inhibition of the substance that forms intervertebral disks or joints. It has been proposed that the whips could have been used in combat and defense, but the tails of diplodocids were quite light and narrow compared to &quot;Shunosaurus&quot; and mamenchisaurids, and thus to injure another animal with the tail would severely injure the tail itself. More recently, Baron (2020) considers the use of the tail as a bullwhip unlikely because of the potentially catastrophic muscle and skeletal damage such speeds could cause on the large and heavy tail. Instead, he proposes that the tails might have been used as a tactile organ to keep in touch with the individuals behind and on the sides in a group while migrating, which could have augmented cohesion and allowed communication among individuals while limiting more energetically demanding activities like stopping to search for dispersed individuals, turning to visually check on individuals behind, or communicating vocally.

==Paleoecology==

The Morrison Formation is a sequence of shallow marine and alluvial sediments which, according to radiometric dating, dates from between 156.3mya at its base, and 146.8mya at the top, placing it in the late Oxfordian, Kimmeridgian, and early Tithonian stages of the Late Jurassic period. This formation is interpreted as originating in a locally semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons. The Morrison Basin, where dinosaurs lived, stretched from New Mexico to Alberta and Saskatchewan; it was formed when the precursors to the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains started pushing up to the west. The deposits from their east-facing drainage basins were carried by streams and rivers and deposited in swampy lowlands, lakes, river channels, and floodplains. This formation is similar in age to the Lourinhã Formation in Portugal and the Tendaguru Formation in Tanzania.
&quot;Apatosaurus&quot; was the second most common sauropod in the Morrison Formation ecosystem, after &quot;Camarasaurus&quot;. &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; may have been more solitary than other Morrison Formation dinosaurs. Fossils of the genus have only been found in the upper levels of the formation. Those of &quot;Apatosaurus ajax&quot; are known exclusively from the upper Brushy Basin Member, about 152–151 mya. &quot;A.louisae&quot; fossils are rare, known only from one site in the upper Brushy Basin Member; they date to the late Kimmeridgian stage, about 151mya. Additional &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; remains are known from similarly aged or slightly younger rocks, but they have not been identified as any particular species, and thus may instead belong to &quot;Brontosaurus&quot;.

The Morrison Formation records a time when the local environment was dominated by gigantic sauropod dinosaurs. Dinosaurs known from the Morrison Formation include the theropods &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;, &quot;Ornitholestes&quot;, and &quot;Torvosaurus&quot;; the sauropods &quot;Brontosaurus&quot;, &quot;Brachiosaurus&quot;, &quot;Camarasaurus&quot;, and &quot;Diplodocus&quot;; and the ornithischians &quot;Camptosaurus&quot;, &quot;Dryosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;. &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; is commonly found at the same sites as &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, &quot;Camarasaurus&quot;, &quot;Diplodocus&quot;, and &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;. &quot;Allosaurus&quot; accounted for 70–75% of theropod specimens and was at the top trophic level of the Morrison food web. Many of the dinosaurs of the Morrison Formation are of the same genera as those seen in Portuguese rocks of the Lourinhã Formationmainly &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Torvosaurus&quot;or have a close counterpart&quot;Brachiosaurus&quot; and &quot;Lusotitan&quot;, &quot;Camptosaurus&quot; and &quot;Draconyx&quot;, and &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; and &quot;Dinheirosaurus&quot;. Other vertebrates that are known to have shared this paleo-environment include ray-finned fishes, frogs, salamanders, turtles, sphenodonts, lizards, terrestrial and aquatic crocodylomorphs, and several species of pterosaur. Shells of bivalves and aquatic snails are also common. The flora of the period has been evidenced in fossils of green algae, fungi, mosses, horsetails, cycads, ginkgoes, and several families of conifers. Vegetation varied from river-lining forests of tree ferns with fern understory (gallery forests), to fern savannas with occasional trees such as the &quot;Araucaria&quot;-like conifer &quot;Brachyphyllum&quot;.

<text>Allosaurus () is an extinct genus of large carnosaurian theropod dinosaur that lived 155 to 145 million years ago during the Late Jurassic period (Kimmeridgian to late Tithonian ages). The name &quot;Allosaurus&quot; means &quot;different lizard&quot;, alluding to its unique (at the time of its discovery) concave vertebrae. It is derived from the Greek words (&#x27;) (&quot;different&quot;, &quot;strange&quot;, or &quot;other&quot;) and (&#x27;) (&quot;lizard&quot; or &quot;reptile&quot;). The first fossil remains that could definitively be ascribed to this genus were described in 1877 by famed paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh. The genus has a very complicated taxonomy and includes at least three valid species, the best known of which is &quot;A. fragilis&quot;. The bulk of &quot;Allosaurus&quot; remains have come from North America&#x27;s Morrison Formation, with material also known from the Alcobaça Formation and Lourinhã Formation in Portugal with teeth known from Germany. It was known for over half of the 20th century as &quot;Antrodemus&quot;, but a study of the abundant remains from the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry returned the name &quot;Allosaurus&quot; to prominence. As one of the first well-known theropod dinosaurs, it has long attracted attention outside of paleontological circles.

&quot;Allosaurus&quot; was a large bipedal predator for its time. Its skull was light, robust, and equipped with dozens of sharp, serrated teeth. It averaged in length for &quot;A. fragilis&quot;, with the largest specimens estimated as being long. Relative to the large and powerful legs, its three-fingered hands were small and the body was balanced by a long, muscular tail. It is classified as an allosaurid, a type of carnosaurian theropod dinosaur. As the most abundant large predator of the Morrison Formation, &quot;Allosaurus&quot; was at the top of the food chain and probably preyed on contemporaneous large herbivorous dinosaurs, with the possibility of hunting other predators. Potential prey included ornithopods, stegosaurids, and sauropods. Some paleontologists interpret &quot;Allosaurus&quot; as having had cooperative social behavior and hunting in packs, while others believe individuals may have been aggressive toward each other and that congregations of this genus are the result of lone individuals feeding on the same carcasses.

==Discovery and history==

===Early discoveries and research===

The discovery and early study of &quot;Allosaurus&quot; is complicated by the multiplicity of names coined during the Bone Wars of the late 19th century. The first described fossil in this history was a bone obtained secondhand by Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden in 1869. It came from Middle Park, near Granby, Colorado, probably from Morrison Formation rocks. The locals had identified such bones as &quot;petrified horse hoofs&quot;. Hayden sent his specimen to Joseph Leidy, who identified it as half of a tail vertebra and tentatively assigned it to the European dinosaur genus &quot;Poekilopleuron&quot; as &quot;Poicilopleuron&quot; &quot;valens&quot;. He later decided it deserved its own genus, &quot;Antrodemus&quot;.

&quot;Allosaurus&quot; itself is based on YPM 1930, a small collection of fragmentary bones including parts of three vertebrae, a rib fragment, a tooth, a toe bone, and (most useful for later discussions) the shaft of the right humerus (upper arm). Othniel Charles Marsh gave these remains the formal name &quot;Allosaurus fragilis&quot; in 1877. &quot;Allosaurus&quot; comes from the Greek words &quot;/&quot;, meaning &quot;strange&quot; or &quot;different&quot;, and &quot;/&quot;, meaning &quot;lizard&quot; or &quot;reptile&quot;. It was named &#x27;different lizard&#x27; because its vertebrae were different from those of other dinosaurs known at the time of its discovery. The species epithet &quot;fragilis&quot; is Latin for &quot;fragile&quot;, referring to lightening features in the vertebrae. The bones were collected from the Morrison Formation of Garden Park, north of Cañon City. O. C. Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope, who were in scientific competition with each other, went on to coin several other genera based on similarly sparse material that would later figure in the taxonomy of &quot;Allosaurus&quot;. These include Marsh&#x27;s &quot;Creosaurus&quot; and &quot;Labrosaurus&quot;, as well as Cope&#x27;s &quot;Epanterias&quot;.

In their haste, Cope and Marsh did not always follow up on their discoveries (or, more commonly, those made by their subordinates). For example, after the discovery by Benjamin Mudge of the type specimen of &quot;Allosaurus&quot; in Colorado, Marsh elected to concentrate work in Wyoming. When work resumed at Garden Park in 1883, M. P. Felch found an almost complete &quot;Allosaurus&quot; and several partial skeletons. In addition, one of Cope&#x27;s collectors, H. F. Hubbell, found a specimen in the Como Bluff area of Wyoming in 1879, but apparently did not mention its completeness and Cope never unpacked it. Upon unpacking it in 1903 (several years after Cope had died), it was found to be one of the most complete theropod specimens then known and the skeleton, now cataloged as AMNH 5753, was put on public view in 1908. This is the well-known mount poised over a partial &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; skeleton as if scavenging it, illustrated as such in a painting by Charles R. Knight. Although notable as the first free-standing mount of a theropod dinosaur and often illustrated and photographed, it has never been scientifically described.

The multiplicity of early names complicated later research, with the situation compounded by the terse descriptions provided by Marsh and Cope. Even at the time, authors such as Samuel Wendell Williston suggested that too many names had been coined. For example, Williston pointed out in 1901 that Marsh had never been able to adequately distinguish &quot;Allosaurus&quot; from &quot;Creosaurus&quot;. The most influential early attempt to sort out the convoluted situation was produced by Charles W. Gilmore in 1920. He came to the conclusion that the tail vertebra named &quot;Antrodemus&quot; by Leidy was indistinguishable from those of &quot;Allosaurus&quot; and that &quot;Antrodemus&quot; should be the preferred name because, as the older name, it had priority. &quot;Antrodemus&quot; became the accepted name for this familiar genus for over 50 years, until James Henry Madsen published on the Cleveland-Lloyd specimens and concluded that &quot;Allosaurus&quot; should be used because &quot;Antrodemus&quot; was based on material with poor, if any, diagnostic features and locality information. For example, the geological formation that the single bone of &quot;Antrodemus&quot; came from is unknown. &quot;Antrodemus&quot; has been used informally for convenience when distinguishing between the skull Gilmore restored and the composite skull restored by Madsen.

===Cleveland-Lloyd discoveries===

Although sporadic work at what became known as the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry in Emery County, Utah, had taken place as early as 1927 and the fossil site itself described by William L. Stokes in 1945, major operations did not begin there until 1960. Under a cooperative effort involving nearly 40 institutions, thousands of bones were recovered between 1960 and 1965, led by James Henry Madsen. The quarry is notable for the predominance of &quot;Allosaurus&quot; remains, the condition of the specimens, and the lack of scientific resolution on how it came to be. The majority of bones belong to the large theropod &quot;Allosaurus fragilis&quot; (it is estimated that the remains of at least 46 &quot;A. fragilis&quot; have been found there, out of at a minimum 73 dinosaurs) and the fossils found there are disarticulated and well-mixed. Nearly a dozen scientific papers have been written on the taphonomy of the site, suggesting numerous mutually exclusive explanations for how it may have formed. Suggestions have ranged from animals getting stuck in a bog, becoming trapped in deep mud, falling victim to drought-induced mortality around a waterhole, and getting trapped in a spring-fed pond or seep. Regardless of the actual cause, the great quantity of well-preserved &quot;Allosaurus&quot; remains has allowed this genus to be known in great detail, making it among the best-known of all theropods. Skeletal remains from the quarry pertain to individuals of almost all ages and sizes, from less than to long, and the disarticulation is an advantage for describing bones usually found fused. Due to being one of Utah&#x27;s two fossil quarries where numerous &quot;Allosaurus&quot; specimens have been discovered, &quot;Allosaurus&quot; was designated as the state fossil of Utah in 1988.

===Modern study===
The period since Madsen&#x27;s monograph has been marked by a great expansion in studies dealing with topics concerning &quot;Allosaurus&quot; in life (paleobiological and paleoecological topics). Such studies have covered topics including skeletal variation, growth, skull construction, hunting methods, the brain, and the possibility of gregarious living and parental care. Reanalysis of old material (particularly of large &#x27;allosaur&#x27; specimens), new discoveries in Portugal, and several very complete new specimens have also contributed to the growing knowledge base.

===&quot;Big Al&quot; and &quot;Big Al II&quot;===

In 1991, &quot;Big Al&quot; (MOR 693), a 95% complete, partially articulated specimen of &quot;Allosaurus&quot; was discovered, measuring about long. MOR 693 was excavated near Shell, Wyoming, by a joint Museum of the Rockies and University of Wyoming Geological Museum team. This skeleton was discovered by a Swiss team, led by Kirby Siber. Chure and Loewen in 2020 identified the individual as a representative of the species &quot;A. jimmadseni&quot;. In 1996, the same team discovered a second &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, &quot;Big Al II&quot;. This specimen, the best preserved skeleton of its kind to date, is also referred to &quot;A. jimmadseni&quot;.

The completeness, preservation, and scientific importance of this skeleton gave &quot;Big Al&quot; its name. The individual itself was below the average size for &quot;Allosaurus fragilis&quot;, as it was a subadult estimated at only 87% grown. The specimen was described by Breithaupt in 1996. Nineteen of its bones were broken or showed signs of serious infection, which may have contributed to &quot;Big Al&#x27;s&quot; death. Pathologic bones included five ribs, five vertebrae, and four bones of the feet. Several of its damaged bones showed signs of osteomyelitis, a severe bone infection. A particular problem for the living animal was infection and trauma to the right foot that probably affected movement and may have also predisposed the other foot to injury because of a change in gait. &quot;Big Al&quot; had an infection on the first phalanx on the third toe that was afflicted by an involucrum. The infection was long-lived, perhaps up to six months. &quot;Big Al II&quot; is also known to have multiple injuries.

===Portuguese discoveries===
In 1988, during construction works of a warehouse, a skeleton of a large theropod was discovered near the village of Andrés, Leiria District, Portugal. The Andrés quarry is included in the Bombarral Formation (&quot;Grés Superiores&quot;). The lower part of this formation is diachronic with the Alcobaça Formation in the northen Lusitanian Basin, and is dated to the Early Tithonian. This specimen was reported in 1999 as the first occurrence of &quot;Allosaurus fragilis&quot; outside North America. The specimen, labeled MNHNUL/AND.001, is deposited in the National Museum of Natural History and Science, Lisbon. It consists of a partial skeleton, composed of an incomplete right quadrate, several vertebrae and chevrons, several dorsal ribs and gastralia, a partial pelvis, most of the hind limbs and several indeterminate fragments. In 2003, Miguel Telles Antunes and Octávio Mateus published a review of the dinosaurs from Portugal, where they assigned the Andrés specimen to &quot;Allosaurus&quot; sp.

The Guimarota coal mine in Leiria, Portugal, produced plenty of remains of micro-vertebrates while it was being explored. The Guimarota beds belong to the Alcobaça Formation, and are dated of the Late Kimmeridgian. In 2005, Oliver Rauhut and Regina Fechner describe the right maxilla of a juvenile theropod (IPFUB Gui Th 4) from the Guimarota mine, that was stored in the collections of the Institute of Geological Sciences of the Free University of Berlin. They attribute the maxilla to &quot;Allosaurus&quot; sp. based on the large maxillary fenestra and coeval presence of the other &quot;Allosaurus&quot; specimens. This specimen allowed the authors to conclude that the development of paranasal pneumacity in theropods is heterochronic, with juveniles having more pronouced pneumaticity than adults.

In 2006, a new species of &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, &quot;A. europaeus&quot;, was reported based a specimen found in a beach near Vale Frades, Lourinhã, Portugal. The specimen, labeled ML415, is deposited in the Lourinhã Museum, and consists of a partial skull, three cervical vertebrae and cervical ribs. It was found in rocks of the Praia Azul Member of the Lourinhã Formation, which in that sector is dated to the Early Tithonian.

In 2005, the Andrés quarry was reactivated for further prospection, which yielded remains of a diverse vertebrate fauna and new &quot;Allosaurus&quot; remains. These new remains (such as a partial right frontal, MNHNUL/AND.001/062), along with further preparation of the original Andrés specimen, allowed for a more detailed comparison with other &quot;Allosaurus&quot; species. The authors concluded that the Andrés specimen is compatible with the diagnosis of &quot;A. fragilis&quot;, and also disputed the attribution of the Vale Frades specimen to a new species, claiming that the autapomorphies proposed in the diagnosis of &quot;A. europaeus&quot; can be explained by individual variation. In 2010, new &quot;Allosaurus&quot; elements from the Andrés quarry are reported, including new cranial remains such as a right quadrate-quadratojudal, two lacrimals, a right dentary, a right frontal, the posterior end of the right mandible and a complete braincase. A second complete left ilium suggests the presence of a second &quot;Allosaurus&quot; individual in the quarry, larger than the first. The authors once again claim that &quot;A. europaeus&quot; should be considered a &quot;nomen dubium&quot; until a more detailed description of the Vale Frades specimen is published.

A detailed description of the remains of the Andrés specimen was published on the doctoral thesis of Elisabete Malafaia. The remains were collected between 1988 and 2010, and include cranial elements (such as the maxilla, nasal, lacrimals, prefrontal, postorbitals, frontals, palatines, quadrate, quadratojugal, squamosal, vomer, braincase, articular, surangulars, prearticular, angulars, supradentary and coronoid, isolated mesial and lateral teeth) and postcranial elements (intercentrum of the atlas, dorsal, sacral and caudal vertebrae, cervical and dorsal ribs, chevrons, coracoid, ilium, pubes, femora, tibiae, fibulae, astragalus and calcaneum, distal tarsal III, second, tird, and fourth metatarsals, and several phalanges). Duplicate elements reported in the thesis include the previously mentioned left ilium, a fragmentary pubic peduncle in articulation with the pubes, and a right frontal, caudal vertebra, and pedal phalanges of a third much smaller individual. The author claims that the Andrés specimens present noticeable differences with both &quot;A. fragilis&quot; and the type specimen of &quot;A. europaeus&quot;, but tentatively assigns it to &quot;Allosaurus&quot; cf. &quot;europaeus&quot;, pending the discovery of more specimens that allow the comparison between the two.

In 2024, Burigo and Mateus publish a redescription and revised diagnosis of the Vale Frades specimen. The authors report new elements, such as the atlas-axis, coronoid, new teeth and rib fragments, and confirm the validity of the species. A specimen-level phylogenetic analysis using scored cranial characters was performed. The authors claim that the Andrés specimen is attributable to &quot;A. europaeus&quot;, and that &quot;A. europaeus&quot; is more closely related to &quot;A. jimmadsenni&quot; than to &quot;A. fragilis&quot;.

===Species===

Seven species of &quot;Allosaurus&quot; have been named: &quot;A. anax&quot;, &quot;A. amplus&quot;, &quot;A. atrox&quot;, &quot;A. europaeus&quot;, the type species &quot;A. fragilis&quot;, &quot;A. jimmadseni&quot; and &quot;A. lucasi&quot;. Among these (excluding &quot;A. anax&quot;, which was named in 2024), Daniel Chure and Mark Loewen in 2020 only recognized the species &quot;A. fragilis&quot;, &quot;A. europaeus&quot;, and the newly-named &quot;A. jimmadseni&quot; as being valid species. Some studies have suggested that &quot;A. europaeus&quot; does not show any unique characters compared to the North American species, though other authors have suggested that the species is valid and has a number of distinguishing characters.

&quot;A. fragilis&quot; is the type species and was named by Marsh in 1877. It is known from the remains of at least 60 individuals, all found in the Kimmeridgian–Tithonian Upper Jurassic-age Morrison Formation of the United States, spread across Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming. Details of the humerus (upper arm) of &quot;A. fragilis&quot; have been used as diagnostic among Morrison theropods, but &quot;A. jimmadseni&quot; indicates that this is no longer the case at the species level.

&quot;A. jimmadseni&quot; has been scientifically described based on two nearly complete skeletons. The first specimen to wear the identification was unearthed in Dinosaur National Monument in northeastern Utah, with the original &quot;Big Al&quot; individual subsequently recognized as belonging to the same species. This species differs from &quot;A. fragilis&quot; in several anatomical details, including a jugal (cheekbone) with a straight lower margin. Fossils are confined to the Salt Wash Member of the Morrison Formation, with &quot;A. fragilis&quot; only found in the higher Brushy Basin Member. The specific name &quot;jimmadseni&quot; is named in honor of Madsen, for his contributions to the taxonomy of the genus, notably for his 1976 work.
&quot;A. fragilis&quot;, &quot;A. jimmadseni&quot;, &quot;A. anax&quot;, &quot;A. amplus&quot;, and &quot;A. lucasi&quot; are all known from remains discovered in the Kimmeridgian–Tithonian Upper Jurassic-age Morrison Formation of the United States, spread across Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming. &quot;A. fragilis&quot; is regarded as the most common, known from the remains of at least 60 individuals. For a while in the late 1980s and early 1990s, it was common to recognize &quot;A. fragilis&quot; as the short-snouted species, with the long-snouted taxon being &quot;A. atrox.&quot; However, subsequent analysis of specimens from the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry, Como Bluff, and Dry Mesa Quarry showed that the differences seen in the Morrison Formation material could be attributed to individual variation. A study of skull elements from the Cleveland-Lloyd site found wide variation between individuals, calling into question previous species-level distinctions based on such features as the shape of the lacrimal horns and the proposed differentiation of &quot;A. jimmadseni&quot; based on the shape of the jugal. &quot;A. anax&quot; was described and named in 2024 from several fossils representing various skeleton parts, the holotype being a postorbital numbered as OMNH 1771. This species is characterized by the lack of rugose ornamentation on the postorbital, the dorsal vertebrae with hourglass-shaped centra and pneumatic foramina, and other features of the postorbital, cervical vertebrae, and fibula. The specific name comes from the Ancient Greek ἄναξ (&quot;anax&quot;, &quot;king&quot;, &quot;lord&quot; or &quot;tribal chief&quot;), and is intended to be an updated reference to the now dubious saurischian genus &quot;Saurophaganax&quot;, to which the fossils were previously attributed.

The &quot;Allosaurus&quot; material from Portugal has a controversial taxonomic research history. The Andrés &quot;Allosaurus&quot; specimens, consisting of very complete cranial and post-cranial remains, have been attributed to &quot;A. fragilis&quot;, &quot;A.&quot; sp&quot;, A. europaeus&quot; and &quot;A.&quot; cf. &quot;europaeus&quot;. The Vale Frades &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, consisting of a partial skull and cervical vertebrae and ribs, is the type specimen of &quot;A. europaeus&quot;, although the validity of that species has been previously questioned. In 2024, a revised diagnosis of &quot;A. europaeus&quot; was published, confirming the validity of the species. The specific affinities of the Andrés specimens are still unclear.

The issue of species and potential synonyms was historically complicated by the type specimen of &quot;Allosaurus fragilis&quot; (YPM 1930) being extremely fragmentary, consisting of a few incomplete vertebrae, limb fragments, rib fragments, and a single tooth. Because of this, several scientists have interpreted the type specimen as potentially dubious, meaning the genus &quot;Allosaurus&quot; itself or at least the species &quot;A. fragilis&quot; would be a &quot;nomen dubium&quot; (&quot;dubious name&quot;, based on a specimen too incomplete to compare to other specimens or to classify). To address this situation, Gregory S. Paul and Kenneth Carpenter (2010) submitted a petition to the ICZN to have the name &quot;A. fragilis&quot; officially transferred to the more complete specimen USNM4734 (as a neotype), a decision that was ratified by the ICZN on December 29, 2023.

Teeth of indeterminate species of &quot;Allosaurus&quot; have been reported from Tönniesberg and Kahlberg in Saxony, Germany, dating to the upper Kimmeridigian.

===Synonyms===

&quot;Creosaurus&quot;, &quot;Epanterias&quot;, and &quot;Labrosaurus&quot; are regarded as junior synonyms of &quot;Allosaurus&quot;. Most of the species that are regarded as synonyms of &quot;A. fragilis&quot;, or that were misassigned to the genus, are obscure and based on very scrappy remains. One exception is &quot;Labrosaurus ferox&quot;, named in 1884 by Marsh for an oddly formed partial lower jaw, with a prominent gap in the tooth row at the tip of the jaw, and a rear section greatly expanded and turned down. Later researchers suggested that the bone was pathologic, showing an injury to the living animal, and that part of the unusual form of the rear of the bone was due to plaster reconstruction. It is now regarded as an example of &quot;A. fragilis&quot;.

In his 1988 book, &quot;Predatory Dinosaurs of the World&quot;, the freelance artist &amp; author Gregory S. Paul proposed that &quot;A. fragilis&quot; had tall pointed horns and a slender build compared to a postulated second species &quot;A. atrox&quot;, as well as not being a different sex due to rarity. &quot;Allosaurus atrox&quot; was originally named by Marsh in 1878 as the type species of its own genus, &quot;Creosaurus&quot;, and is based on YPM 1890, an assortment of bones that includes a couple of pieces of the skull, portions of nine tail vertebrae, two hip vertebrae, an ilium, and ankle and foot bones. Although the idea of two common Morrison allosaur species was followed in some semi-technical and popular works, the 2000 thesis on Allosauridae noted that Charles Gilmore mistakenly reconstructed USNM 4734 as having a shorter skull than the specimens referred by Paul to &quot;atrox&quot;, refuting supposed differences between USNM 4734 and putative &quot;A. atrox&quot; specimens like DINO 2560, AMNH 600, and AMNH 666.

&quot;Allosaurus agilis&quot;, seen in Zittel, 1887, and Osborn, 1912, is a typographical error for &quot;A. fragilis.&quot; &quot;Allosaurus ferox&quot; is a typographical error by Marsh for &quot;A. fragilis&quot; in a figure caption for the partial skull YPM 1893 and YPM 1893 has been treated as a specimen of &quot;A fragilis&quot;. Likewise, &quot;Labrosaurus fragilis&quot; is a typographical error by Marsh (1896) for &quot;Labrosaurus ferox&quot;. &quot;A. whitei&quot; is a &quot;nomen nudum&quot; coined by Pickering in 1996 for the complete &quot;Allosaurus&quot; specimens that Paul referred to &quot;A. atrox&quot;.

&quot;Madsenius&quot; was coined by David Lambert in 1990, being based on remains from Dinosaur National Monument assigned to &quot;Allosaurus&quot; or &quot;Creosaurus&quot; (a synonym of &quot;Allosaurus&quot;), and was to be described by paleontologist Robert Bakker as &quot;Madsenius trux&quot;. However, &quot;Madsenius&quot; is now seen as yet another synonym of &quot;Allosaurus&quot; because Bakker&#x27;s action was predicated upon the false assumption of USNM 4734 being distinct from long-snouted &quot;Allosaurus&quot; due to errors in Gilmore&#x27;s 1920 reconstruction of USNM 4734.

&quot;Wyomingraptor&quot; was informally coined by Bakker for allosaurid remains from the Morrison Formation of the Late Jurassic. The remains unearthed are labeled as &quot;Allosaurus&quot; and are housed in the Tate Geological Museum. However, there has been no official description of the remains and &quot;Wyomingraptor&quot; has been dismissed as a &quot;nomen nudum&quot;, with the remains referable to &quot;Allosaurus&quot;.

===Formerly assigned species and fossils===

Several species initially classified within or referred to &quot;Allosaurus&quot; do not belong within the genus. &quot;A. medius&quot; was named by Marsh in 1888 for various specimens from the Early Cretaceous Arundel Formation of Maryland, although most of the remains were removed by Richard Swann Lull to the new ornithopod species &quot;Dryosaurus grandis&quot;, except for a tooth. It was transferred to &quot;Antrodemus&quot; by Oliver Hay in 1902, but Hay later clarified that this was an inexplicable error on his part. Gilmore considered the tooth nondiagnostic but transferred it to &quot;Dryptosaurus&quot;, as &quot;D. medius&quot;. The referral was not accepted in the most recent review of basal tetanurans, and &quot;Allosaurus medius&quot; was simply listed as a dubious species of theropod. It may be closely related to &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot;.

&quot;Allosaurus valens&quot; is a new combination for &quot;Antrodemus valens&quot; used by Friedrich von Huene in 1932; &quot;Antrodemus valens&quot; itself may also pertain to &quot;Allosaurus fragilis&quot;, as Gilmore suggested in 1920.

&quot;A. lucaris&quot;, another Marsh name, was given to a partial skeleton in 1878. He later decided it warranted its own genus, &quot;Labrosaurus&quot;, but this has not been accepted, and &quot;A. lucaris&quot; is also regarded as another specimen of &quot;A. fragilis&quot;. &quot;Allosaurus lucaris&quot;, is known mostly from vertebrae, sharing characters with &quot;Allosaurus&quot;. Paul and Carpenter stated that the type specimen of this species, YPM 1931, was from a younger age than &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, and might represent a different genus. However, they found that the specimen was undiagnostic, and thus &quot;A. lucaris&quot; was a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;.

&quot;Allosaurus sibiricus&quot; was described in 1914 by A. N. Riabinin on the basis of a bone, later identified as a partial fourth metatarsal, from the Early Cretaceous of Buryatia, Russia. It was transferred to &quot;Chilantaisaurus&quot; in 1990, but is now considered a &quot;nomen dubium&quot; indeterminate beyond Theropoda.

&quot;Allosaurus meriani&quot; was a new combination by George Olshevsky for &quot;Megalosaurus meriani&quot; Greppin, 1870, based on a tooth from the Late Jurassic of Switzerland. However, a recent overview of &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; included it in &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; sp.

&quot;Apatodon mirus&quot;, based on a scrap of vertebra Marsh first thought to be a mammalian jaw, has been listed as a synonym of &quot;Allosaurus fragilis&quot;. However, it was considered indeterminate beyond Dinosauria by Chure, and Mickey Mortimer believes that the synonymy of &quot;Apatodon&quot; with &quot;Allosaurus&quot; was due to correspondence to Ralph Molnar by John McIntosh, whereby the latter reportedly found a paper saying that Othniel Charles Marsh admitted that the &quot;Apatodon&quot; holotype was actually an allosaurid dorsal vertebra.
&quot;A. amplexus&quot; was named by Gregory S. Paul for giant Morrison allosaur remains, and included in his conception &quot;Saurophagus maximus&quot; (later &quot;Saurophaganax&quot;). &quot;A. amplexus&quot; was originally coined by Cope in 1878 as the type species of his new genus &quot;Epanterias&quot;, and is based on what is now AMNH 5767, parts of three vertebrae, a coracoid, and a metatarsal. Following Paul&#x27;s work, this species has been accepted as a synonym of &quot;A. fragilis&quot;. A 2010 study by Paul and Kenneth Carpenter, however, indicates that &quot;Epanterias&quot; is temporally younger than the &quot;A. fragilis&quot; type specimen, so it is a separate species at minimum.

&quot;A. maximus&quot; was a new combination by David K. Smith for Chure&#x27;s &quot;Saurophaganax maximus&quot;, a taxon created by Chure in 1995 for giant allosaurid remains from the Morrison of Oklahoma. These remains had been known as &quot;Saurophagus&quot;, but that name was already in use, leading Chure to propose a substitute. Smith, in his 1998 analysis of variation, concluded that &quot;S. maximus&quot; was not different enough from &quot;Allosaurus&quot; to be a separate genus, but did warrant its own species, &quot;A. maximus&quot;. This reassignment was rejected in a review of basal tetanurans. A 2024 reassessment of fossil material assigned to &quot;Saurophaganax&quot; suggested that the holotype neural arch of this taxon could not confidently be assigned to a theropod, but that it exhibited some similarities to sauropods. Other &quot;Saurophaganax&quot; bones could be referred to diplodocid sauropods. As such, the researchers assigned the remaining theropod bones to a new species of &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, &quot;A. anax&quot;.

There are also several species left over from the synonymizations of &quot;Creosaurus&quot; and &quot;Labrosaurus&quot; with &quot;Allosaurus&quot;. &quot;Creosaurus potens&quot; was named by Lull in 1911 for a vertebra from the Early Cretaceous of Maryland. It is now regarded as a dubious theropod. &quot;Labrosaurus stechowi&quot;, described in 1920 by Janensch based on isolated &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;-like teeth from the Tendaguru beds of Tanzania, was listed by Donald F. Glut as a species of &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, is now considered a dubious ceratosaurian related to &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;. &quot;L. sulcatus&quot;, named by Marsh in 1896 for a Morrison theropod tooth, which like &quot;L. stechowi&quot; is now regarded as a dubious &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;-like ceratosaur.
&quot;A. tendagurensis&quot; was named in 1925 by Werner Janensch for a partial shin (MB.R.3620) found in the Kimmeridgian-age Tendaguru Formation in Mtwara, Tanzania. Although tabulated as a tentatively valid species of &quot;Allosaurus&quot; in the second edition of the Dinosauria, subsequent studies place it as indeterminate beyond Tetanurae, either a carcharodontosaurian or megalosaurid. Although obscure, it was a large theropod, possibly around long and in weight.

Kurzanov and colleagues in 2003 designated six teeth from Siberia as &quot;Allosaurus&quot; sp. (meaning the authors found the specimens to be most like those of &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, but did not or could not assign a species to them). They were reclassified as an indeterminate theropod. Also, reports of &quot;Allosaurus&quot; in Shanxi, China go back to at least 1982. These were interpreted as &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; remains in 2012.

An astragalus (ankle bone) thought to belong to a species of &quot;Allosaurus&quot; was found at Cape Paterson, Victoria in Early Cretaceous beds in southeastern Australia. It was thought to provide evidence that Australia was a refugium for animals that had gone extinct elsewhere. This identification was challenged by Samuel Welles, who thought it more resembled that of an ornithomimid, but the original authors defended their identification. With fifteen years of new specimens and research to look at, Daniel Chure reexamined the bone and found that it was not &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, but could represent an allosauroid. Similarly, Yoichi Azuma and Phil Currie, in their description of &quot;Fukuiraptor&quot;, noted that the bone closely resembled that of their new genus. This specimen is sometimes referred to as &quot;Allosaurus robustus&quot;, an informal museum name. It likely belonged to something similar to &quot;Australovenator&quot;, although one study considered it to belong to an abelisaur.

==Description==

&quot;Allosaurus&quot; was a typical large theropod, having a massive skull on a short neck, a long, slightly sloping tail, and reduced forelimbs. &quot;Allosaurus fragilis&quot;, the best-known species, had an average length of and mass of , with the largest definitive &quot;Allosaurus&quot; specimen (AMNH 680) estimated at long, with an estimated weight of . In his 1976 monograph on &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, James H. Madsen mentioned a range of bone sizes which he interpreted to show a maximum length of . As with dinosaurs in general, weight estimates are debatable, and since 1980 have ranged between , , and approximately for modal adult weight (not maximum). John Foster, a specialist on the Morrison Formation, suggests that is reasonable for large adults of &quot;A. fragilis&quot;, but that is a closer estimate for individuals represented by the average-sized thigh bones he has measured. Using the subadult specimen nicknamed &quot;Big Al&quot;, since assigned to the species &quot;Allosaurus jimmadseni&quot;, researchers using computer modeling arrived at a best estimate of for the individual, but by varying parameters they found a range from approximately to approximately . A separate computational project estimated the adaptive optimum body mass in &quot;Allosaurus&quot; to be ~2,345 kg. &quot;A. europaeus&quot; has been measured up to in length and in body mass.

Several gigantic specimens have been attributed to &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, but may in fact belong to other genera. The dubious genus &quot;Saurophaganax&quot; (OMNH 1708) was estimated to reach around in length, and its single species was sometimes included in the genus &quot;Allosaurus&quot; as &quot;Allosaurus maximus&quot;. However, a 2024 study concluded that some material assigned to &quot;Saurophaganax&quot; actually belonged to a diplodocid sauropod with the material confidently assigned to Allosauridae belonging to a new species of &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, &quot;A. anax&quot;, and the body mass of this species was tentatively estimated around based on fragmentary material. Another potential specimen of &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, once assigned to the genus &quot;Epanterias&quot; (AMNH 5767), may have measured in length. A more recent discovery is a partial skeleton from the Peterson Quarry in Morrison rocks of New Mexico; this large allosaurid was suggested to be a potential specimen of &quot;Saurophaganax&quot; prior to this taxon&#x27;s 2024 reassessment.

David K. Smith, examining &quot;Allosaurus&quot; fossils by quarry, found that the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry (Utah) specimens are generally smaller than those from Como Bluff (Wyoming) or Brigham Young University&#x27;s Dry Mesa Quarry (Colorado), but the shapes of the bones themselves did not vary between the sites. A later study by Smith incorporating Garden Park (Colorado) and Dinosaur National Monument (Utah) specimens found no justification for multiple species based on skeletal variation; skull variation was most common and was gradational, suggesting individual variation was responsible. Further work on size-related variation again found no consistent differences, although the Dry Mesa material tended to clump together on the basis of the astragalus, an ankle bone. Kenneth Carpenter, using skull elements from the Cleveland-Lloyd site, found wide variation between individuals, calling into question previous species-level distinctions based on such features as the shape of the horns, and the proposed differentiation of &quot;A. jimmadseni&quot; based on the shape of the jugal. A study published by Motani et al., in 2020 suggests that &quot;Allosaurus&quot; was also sexually dimorphic in the width of the femur&#x27;s head against its length.

===Skull===

The skull and teeth of &quot;Allosaurus&quot; were modestly proportioned for a theropod of its size. Paleontologist Gregory S. Paul gives a length of for a skull belonging to an individual he estimates at long. Each premaxilla (the bones that formed the tip of the snout) held five teeth with D-shaped cross-sections, and each maxilla (the main tooth-bearing bones in the upper jaw) had between 14 and 17 teeth; the number of teeth does not exactly correspond to the size of the bone. Each dentary (the tooth-bearing bone of the lower jaw) had between 14 and 17 teeth, with an average count of 16. The teeth became shorter, narrower, and more curved toward the back of the skull. All of the teeth had saw-like edges. They were shed easily, and were replaced continually, making them common fossils. Its skull was light, robust and equipped with dozens of sharp, serrated teeth.

The skull had a pair of horns above and in front of the eyes. These horns were composed of extensions of the lacrimal bones, and varied in shape and size. There were also lower paired ridges running along the top edges of the nasal bones that led into the horns. The horns were probably covered in a keratin sheath and may have had a variety of functions, including acting as sunshades for the eyes, being used for display, and being used in combat against other members of the same species (although they were fragile). There was a ridge along the back of the skull roof for muscle attachment, as is also seen in tyrannosaurids.

Inside the lacrimal bones were depressions that may have held glands, such as salt glands. Within the maxillae were sinuses that were better developed than those of more basal theropods such as &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; and &quot;Marshosaurus&quot;; they may have been related to the sense of smell, perhaps holding something like Jacobson&#x27;s organs. The roof of the braincase was thin, perhaps to improve thermoregulation for the brain. The skull and lower jaws had joints that permitted motion within these units. In the lower jaws, the bones of the front and back halves loosely articulated, permitting the jaws to bow outward and increasing the animal&#x27;s gape. The braincase and frontals may also have had a joint.

===Postcranial skeleton===

&quot;Allosaurus&quot; had nine vertebrae in the neck, 14 in the back, and five in the sacrum supporting the hips. The number of tail vertebrae is unknown and varied with individual size; James Madsen estimated about 50, while Gregory S. Paul considered that to be too many and suggested 45 or less. There were hollow spaces in the neck and anterior back vertebrae. Such spaces, which are also found in modern theropods (that is, the birds), are interpreted as having held air sacs used in respiration. The rib cage was broad, giving it a barrel chest, especially in comparison to less derived theropods like &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;. &quot;Allosaurus&quot; had gastralia (belly ribs), but these are not common findings, and they may have ossified poorly. In one published case, the gastralia show evidence of injury during life. A furcula (wishbone) was also present, but has only been recognized since 1996; in some cases furculae were confused with gastralia. The ilium, the main hip bone, was massive, and the pubic bone had a prominent foot that may have been used for both muscle attachment and as a prop for resting the body on the ground. Madsen noted that in about half of the individuals from the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry, independent of size, the pubes had not fused to each other at their foot ends. He suggested that this was a sexual characteristic, with females lacking fused bones to make egg-laying easier. This proposal has not attracted further attention, however.

The forelimbs of &quot;Allosaurus&quot; were short in comparison to the hindlimbs (only about 35% the length of the hindlimbs in adults) and had three fingers per hand, tipped with large, strongly curved and pointed claws. The arms were powerful, and the forearm was somewhat shorter than the upper arm (1:1.2 ulna/humerus ratio). The wrist had a version of the semilunate carpal also found in more derived theropods like maniraptorans. Of the three fingers, the innermost (or thumb) was the largest, and diverged from the others. The phalangeal formula is 2-3-4-0-0, meaning that the innermost finger (phalange) has two bones, the next has three, and the third finger has four. The legs were not as long or suited for speed as those of tyrannosaurids, and the claws of the toes were less developed and more hoof-like than those of earlier theropods. Each foot had three weight-bearing toes and an inner dewclaw, which Madsen suggested could have been used for grasping in juveniles. There was also what is interpreted as the splint-like remnant of a fifth (outermost) metatarsal, perhaps used as a lever between the Achilles tendon and foot.

=== Skin ===
Skin impressions from &quot;Allosaurus&quot; have been described. One impression, from a juvenile specimen, measures 30 cm² and is associated with the anterior dorsal ribs/pectoral region. The impression shows small scales measuring 1–3 mm in diameter. A skin impression from the &quot;Big Al Two&quot; specimen, associated with the base of the tail, measures 20 cm x 20 cm and shows large scales measuring up to 2 cm in diameter. However, it has been noted that these scales are more similar to those of sauropods, and due to the presence of non-theropod remains associated with the tail of &quot;Big Al Two&quot; there is a possibility that this skin impression is not from &quot;Allosaurus&quot;.

Another &quot;Allosaurus&quot; fossil features a skin impression from the mandible, showing scales measuring 1–2 mm in diameter. The same fossil also preserves skin measuring 20 x 20 cm from the ventral side of the neck, showing scutate scales measuring 0.5 cm wide and 11 cm long. A small skin impression from an &quot;Allosaurus&quot; skull has been reported but never described.

==Classification==

&quot;Allosaurus&quot; was an allosaurid, a member of a family of large theropods within the larger group Carnosauria. The family name Allosauridae was created for this genus in 1878 by Othniel Charles Marsh, but the term was largely unused until the 1970s in favor of Megalosauridae, another family of large theropods that eventually became a wastebasket taxon. This, along with the use of &quot;Antrodemus&quot; for &quot;Allosaurus&quot; during the same period, is a point that needs to be remembered when searching for information on &quot;Allosaurus&quot; in publications that predate James Madsen&#x27;s 1976 monograph. Major publications using the name &quot;Megalosauridae&quot; instead of &quot;Allosauridae&quot; include Gilmore, 1920, von Huene, 1926, Romer, 1956 and 1966, Steel, 1970, and Walker, 1964.

Following the publication of Madsen&#x27;s influential monograph, Allosauridae became the preferred family assignment, but it too was not strongly defined. Semi-technical works used Allosauridae for a variety of large theropods, usually those that were larger and better-known than megalosaurids. Typical theropods that were thought to be related to &quot;Allosaurus&quot; included &quot;Indosaurus&quot;, &quot;Piatnitzkysaurus&quot;, &quot;Piveteausaurus&quot;, &quot;Yangchuanosaurus&quot;, &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot;, &quot;Chilantaisaurus&quot;, &quot;Compsosuchus&quot;, &quot;Stokesosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Szechuanosaurus&quot;. Given modern knowledge of theropod diversity and the advent of cladistic study of evolutionary relationships, none of these theropods is now recognized as an allosaurid, although several, like &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; and &quot;Yangchuanosaurus&quot;, are members of closely related families.
Below is a cladogram based on the analysis of Benson et al. in 2010.

Allosauridae is one of four families in Allosauroidea; the other three are Neovenatoridae, Carcharodontosauridae and Sinraptoridae. Allosauridae has at times been proposed as ancestral to the Tyrannosauridae (which would make it paraphyletic), one example being Gregory S. Paul&#x27;s &quot;Predatory Dinosaurs of the World&quot;, but this has been rejected, with tyrannosaurids identified as members of a separate branch of theropods, the Coelurosauria. Allosauridae is the smallest of the carnosaur families, with only &quot;Saurophaganax&quot; and a currently unnamed French allosauroid accepted as possible valid genera besides &quot;Allosaurus&quot; in the most recent review. Another genus, &quot;Epanterias&quot;, is a potential valid member, but it and &quot;Saurophaganax&quot; may turn out to be large examples of &quot;Allosaurus&quot;. Some reviews have kept the genus &quot;Saurophaganax&quot; and included &quot;Epanterias&quot; with &quot;Allosaurus&quot;.

The controversial &quot;Saurophaganax&quot;, initially recognized as a large &quot;Allosaurus&quot;-like theropod, has had a controversial taxonomic history. In 2019, Rauhut and Pol noted that its taxonomic placement within Allosauroidea is unstable, being recovered as a sister taxon of Metriacanthosauridae or Allosauria, or even as the basalmost carcharodontosaurian. In 2024, &quot;Saurophaganax&quot; was reassessed as a dubious, chimeric taxon with the holotype being so fragmentary that it could only be confidently referred to the Saurischia, and some specimens more likely belonging to a diplodocid sauropod.

==Paleobiology==
===Life history===

The wealth of &quot;Allosaurus&quot; fossils, from nearly all ages of individuals, allows scientists to study how the animal grew and how long its lifespan may have been. Remains may reach as far back in the lifespan as eggs—crushed eggs from Colorado have been suggested as those of &quot;Allosaurus&quot;. Based on histological analysis of limb bones, bone deposition appears to stop at around 22 to 28 years, which is comparable to that of other large theropods like &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;. From the same analysis, its maximum growth appears to have been at age 15, with an estimated growth rate of about 150 kilograms (330 lb) per year.

Medullary bone tissue (endosteally derived, ephemeral, mineralization located inside the medulla of the long bones in gravid female birds) has been reported in at least one &quot;Allosaurus&quot; specimen, a shin bone from the Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry. Today, this bone tissue is only formed in female birds that are laying eggs, as it is used to supply calcium to shells. Its presence in the &quot;Allosaurus&quot; individual has been used to establish sex and show it had reached reproductive age. However, other studies have called into question some cases of medullary bone in dinosaurs, including this &quot;Allosaurus&quot; individual. Data from extant birds suggested that the medullary bone in this &quot;Allosaurus&quot; individual may have been the result of a bone pathology instead. However, with the confirmation of medullary tissue indicating sex in a specimen of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, it may be possible to ascertain whether or not the &quot;Allosaurus&quot; in question was indeed female.
The discovery of a juvenile specimen with a nearly complete hindlimb shows that the legs were relatively longer in juveniles, and the lower segments of the leg (shin and foot) were relatively longer than the thigh. These differences suggest that younger &quot;Allosaurus&quot; were faster and had different hunting strategies than adults, perhaps chasing small prey as juveniles, then becoming ambush hunters of large prey upon adulthood. The thigh bone became thicker and wider during growth, and the cross-section less circular, as muscle attachments shifted, muscles became shorter, and the growth of the leg slowed. These changes imply that juvenile legs has less predictable stresses compared with adults, which would have moved with more regular forward progression. Conversely, the skull bones appear to have generally grown isometrically, increasing in size without changing in proportion.

===Feeding===

Most paleontologists accept &quot;Allosaurus&quot; as an active predator of large animals. There is dramatic evidence for allosaur attacks on &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;, including an &quot;Allosaurus&quot; tail vertebra with a partially healed puncture wound that fits a &quot;Stegosaurus&quot; tail spike, and a &quot;Stegosaurus&quot; neck plate with a U-shaped wound that correlates well with an &quot;Allosaurus&quot; snout. Sauropods seem to be likely candidates as both live prey and as objects of scavenging, based on the presence of scrapings on sauropod bones fitting allosaur teeth well and the presence of shed allosaur teeth with sauropod bones. However, as Gregory Paul noted in 1988, &quot;Allosaurus&quot; was probably not a predator of fully grown sauropods, unless it hunted in packs, as it had a modestly sized skull and relatively small teeth, and was greatly outweighed by contemporaneous sauropods. Another possibility is that it preferred to hunt juveniles instead of fully grown adults. Research in the 1990s and the first decade of the 21st century may have found other solutions to this question. Robert T. Bakker, comparing &quot;Allosaurus&quot; to Cenozoic saber-toothed carnivorous mammals, found similar adaptations, such as a reduction of jaw muscles and increase in neck muscles, and the ability to open the jaws extremely wide. Although &quot;Allosaurus&quot; did not have saber teeth, Bakker suggested another mode of attack that would have used such neck and jaw adaptations: the short teeth in effect became small serrations on a saw-like cutting edge running the length of the upper jaw, which would have been driven into prey. This type of jaw would permit slashing attacks against much larger prey, with the goal of weakening the victim.

Similar conclusions were drawn by another study using finite element analysis on an &quot;Allosaurus&quot; skull. According to their biomechanical analysis, the skull was very strong but had a relatively small bite force. By using jaw muscles only, it could produce a bite force of 805 to 8,724 N, but the skull could withstand nearly 55,500 N of vertical force against the tooth row. The authors suggested that &quot;Allosaurus&quot; used its skull like a machete against prey, attacking open-mouthed, slashing flesh with its teeth, and tearing it away without splintering bones, unlike &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, which is thought to have been capable of damaging bones. They also suggested that the architecture of the skull could have permitted the use of different strategies against different prey; the skull was light enough to allow attacks on smaller and more agile ornithopods, but strong enough for high-impact ambush attacks against larger prey like stegosaurids and sauropods. Their interpretations were challenged by other researchers, who found no modern analogs to a hatchet attack and considered it more likely that the skull was strong to compensate for its open construction when absorbing the stresses from struggling prey. The original authors noted that &quot;Allosaurus&quot; itself has no modern equivalent, that the tooth row is well-suited to such an attack, and that articulations in the skull cited by their detractors as problematic actually helped protect the palate and lessen stress. Another possibility for handling large prey is that theropods like &quot;Allosaurus&quot; were &quot;flesh grazers&quot; which could take bites of flesh out of living sauropods that were sufficient to sustain the predator so it would not have needed to expend the effort to kill the prey outright. This strategy would also potentially have allowed the prey to recover and be fed upon in a similar way later. An additional suggestion notes that ornithopods were the most common available dinosaurian prey, and that &quot;Allosaurus&quot; may have subdued them by using an attack similar to that of modern big cats: grasping the prey with their forelimbs, and then making multiple bites on the throat to crush the trachea. This is compatible with other evidence that the forelimbs were strong and capable of restraining prey. Studies done by Stephen Lautenschager et al. from the University of Bristol also indicate &quot;Allosaurus&quot; could open its jaws quite wide and sustain considerable muscle force. When compared with &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; and the therizinosaurid &quot;Erlikosaurus&quot; in the same study, it was found that &quot;Allosaurus&quot; had a wider gape than either; the animal was capable of opening its jaws to a 92-degree angle at maximum. The findings also indicate that large carnivorous dinosaurs, like modern carnivores, had wider jaw gapes than herbivores.
A biomechanical study published in 2013 by Eric Snively and colleagues found that &quot;Allosaurus&quot; had an unusually low attachment point on the skull for the longissimus capitis superficialis neck muscle compared to other theropods such as &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;. This would have allowed the animal to make rapid and forceful vertical movements with the skull. The authors found that vertical strikes as proposed by Bakker and Rayfield are consistent with the animal&#x27;s capabilities. They also found that the animal probably processed carcasses by vertical movements in a similar manner to falcons, such as kestrels: The animal could have gripped prey with the skull and feet, then pulled back and up to remove flesh. This differs from the prey-handling envisioned for tyrannosaurids, which probably tore flesh with lateral shakes of the skull, similar to crocodilians. In addition, &quot;Allosaurus&quot; was able to &quot;move its head and neck around relatively rapidly and with considerable control&quot;, at the cost of power.

Other aspects of feeding include the eyes, arms, and legs. The shape of the skull of &quot;Allosaurus&quot; limited potential binocular vision to 20° of width, slightly less than that of modern crocodilians. As with crocodilians, this may have been enough to judge prey distance and time attacks. The arms, compared with those of other theropods, were suited for both grasping prey at a distance or clutching it close, and the articulation of the claws suggests that they could have been used to hook things. Finally, the top speed of &quot;Allosaurus&quot; has been estimated at per hour.

A paper on the cranio-dental morphology of &quot;Allosaurus&quot; and how it worked has deemed the hatchet jaw attack unlikely, reinterpreting the unusually wide gape as an adaptation to allow &quot;Allosaurus&quot; to deliver a muscle-driven bite to large prey, with the weaker jaw muscles being a trade-off to allow for the widened gape.
Sauropod carrion may also have been important to large theropods in the Morrison Formation. Forensic techniques indicate that sauropod carcasses were targeted by &quot;Allosaurus&quot; at all stages of decomposition, indicating that late-stage decay pathogens were not a significant deterrent. A survey of sauropod bones from the Morrison Formation also reported widespread bite marks on sauropod bones in low-economy regions, which suggests that large theropods scavenged large sauropods when available, with the scarcity of such bite marks on the remains of smaller bones being potentially attributable to much more complete consumption of smaller or adolescent sauropods and on ornithischians, which would have been more commonly taken as live prey. A single dead adult &quot;Barosaurus&quot; or &quot;Brachiosaurus&quot; would have had enough calories to sustain multiple large theropods for weeks or months, though the vast majority of the Morrison&#x27;s sauropod fossil record consisted of much smaller-bodied taxa such as &quot;Camarasaurus lentus&quot; or &quot;Diplodocus&quot;.

It has also been argued that disabled individuals such as Big Al and Big Al II were physically incapable of hunting due to their numerous injuries but were able to survive nonetheless as scavengers of giant sauropod-falls, Interestingly, a recent review of paleopathologies in theropods may support this conclusion. The researchers found a positive association between allosaurids and fractures to the appendicular skeleton, while tyrannosaurs had a statistically negative association with these types of injuries. The fact that allosaurs were more likely to survive and heal even when severe fractures limited their locomotion abilities can be explained, in part, by different resource accessibility paradigms for the two groups, as allosauroids generally lived in sauropod-inhabited ecosystems, some of which, including the Morrison, have been interpreted as arid and highly water-stressed environments; however, the water-stressed nature of the Morrison has been heavily criticized in several more recent works on the basis of fossil evidence for the presence of extensive forest cover and aquatic ecosystems.

===Social behavior===

It has been speculated since the 1970s that &quot;Allosaurus&quot; preyed on sauropods and other large dinosaurs by hunting in groups.
Such a depiction is common in semitechnical and popular dinosaur literature. Robert T. Bakker has extended social behavior to parental care, and has interpreted shed allosaur teeth and chewed bones of large prey animals as evidence that adult allosaurs brought food to lairs for their young to eat until they were grown, and prevented other carnivores from scavenging on the food. However, there is actually little evidence of gregarious behavior in theropods, and social interactions with members of the same species would have included antagonistic encounters, as shown by injuries to gastralia and bite wounds to skulls (the pathologic lower jaw named &quot;Labrosaurus ferox&quot; is one such possible example). Such head-biting may have been a way to establish dominance in a pack or to settle territorial disputes.

Although &quot;Allosaurus&quot; may have hunted in packs, it has been argued that &quot;Allosaurus&quot; and other theropods had largely aggressive interactions instead of cooperative interactions with other members of their own species. The study in question noted that cooperative hunting of prey much larger than an individual predator, as is commonly inferred for theropod dinosaurs, is rare among vertebrates in general, and modern diapsid carnivores (including lizards, crocodiles, and birds) rarely cooperate to hunt in such a way. Instead, they are typically territorial and will kill and cannibalize intruders of the same species, and will also do the same to smaller individuals that attempt to eat before they do when aggregated at feeding sites. According to this interpretation, the accumulation of remains of multiple &quot;Allosaurus&quot; individuals at the same site; e.g., in the Cleveland–Lloyd Quarry, are not due to pack hunting, but to the fact that &quot;Allosaurus&quot; individuals were drawn together to feed on other disabled or dead allosaurs, and were sometimes killed in the process. This could explain the high proportion of juvenile and subadult allosaurs present, as juveniles and subadults are disproportionally killed at modern group feeding sites of animals like crocodiles and Komodo dragons. The same interpretation applies to Bakker&#x27;s lair sites. There is some evidence for cannibalism in &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, including &quot;Allosaurus&quot; shed teeth found among rib fragments, possible tooth marks on a shoulder blade, and cannibalized allosaur skeletons among the bones at Bakker&#x27;s lair sites.

===Brain and senses===

The brain of &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, as interpreted from spiral CT scanning of an endocast, was more consistent with crocodilian brains than those of the other living archosaurs, birds. The structure of the vestibular apparatus indicates that the skull was held nearly horizontal, as opposed to strongly tipped up or down. The structure of the inner ear was like that of a crocodilian, indicating that &quot;Allosaurus&quot; was more adapted to hear lower frequencies and would have had difficulty hearing subtle sounds. The olfactory bulbs were large and well suited for detecting odors, but were typical for an animal of its size.

===Paleopathology===

In 2001, Bruce Rothschild and others published a study examining evidence for stress-fractures and tendon avulsions in theropod dinosaurs and the implications for their behavior. Since stress-fractures are caused by repeated trauma rather than singular events they are more likely to be caused by the behavior of the animal than other kinds of injury. Stress-fractures and tendon avulsions occurring in the forelimb have special behavioral significance since while injuries to the feet could be caused by running or migration, resistant prey items are the most probable source of injuries to the hand. &quot;Allosaurus&quot; was one of only two theropods examined in the study to exhibit a tendon avulsion, and in both cases the avulsion occurred on the forelimb. When the researchers looked for stress-fractures, they found that &quot;Allosaurus&quot; had a significantly greater number of stress-fractures than &quot;Albertosaurus&quot;, &quot;Ornithomimus&quot; or &quot;Archaeornithomimus&quot;. Of the 47 hand bones the researchers studied, three were found to contain stress-fractures. Of the feet, 281 bones were studied and 17 were found to have stress-fractures. The stress-fractures in the foot bones &quot;were distributed to the proximal phalanges&quot; and occurred across all three weight-bearing toes in &quot;statistically indistinguishable&quot; numbers. Since the lower end of the third metatarsal would have contacted the ground first while an allosaur was running, it would have borne the most stress. If the allosaurs&#x27; stress-fractures were caused by damage accumulating while walking or running this bone should have experience more stress-fractures than the others. The lack of such a bias in the examined &quot;Allosaurus&quot; fossils indicates an origin for the stress-fractures from a source other than running. The authors conclude that these fractures occurred during interaction with prey, like an allosaur trying to hold struggling prey with its feet. The abundance of stress-fractures and avulsion injuries in &quot;Allosaurus&quot; provide evidence for &quot;very active&quot; predation-based rather than scavenging diets.

The left scapula and fibula of an &quot;Allosaurus fragilis&quot; specimen cataloged as USNM 4734 are both pathological, both probably due to healed fractures. The specimen USNM 8367 preserved several pathological gastralia which preserve evidence of healed fractures near their middle. Some of the fractures were poorly healed and &quot;formed pseudoarthroses&quot;. A specimen with a fractured rib was recovered from the Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry. Another specimen had fractured ribs and fused vertebrae near the end of the tail. An apparent subadult male &quot;Allosaurus fragilis&quot; was reported to have extensive pathologies, with a total of fourteen separate injuries. The specimen MOR 693 had pathologies on five ribs, the sixth neck vertebra, the third, eighth, and thirteenth back vertebrae, the second tail vertebra and its chevron, the gastralia right scapula, manual phalanx I left ilium metatarsals III and V, the first phalanx of the third toe and the third phalanx of the second. The ilium had &quot;a large hole...caused by a blow from above&quot;. The near end of the first phalanx of the third toe was afflicted by an involucrum.

Additionally, a subadult &quot;Allosaurus&quot; individual that suffered from spondyloarthropathy has been discovered in Dana Quarry in Wyoming. This finding represents the first known fossil evidence of spondyloarthropathy occurring in a theropod.

Other pathologies reported in &quot;Allosaurus&quot; include:
* Willow breaks in two ribs
* Healed fractures in the humerus and radius
* Distortion of joint surfaces in the foot, possibly due to osteoarthritis or developmental issues
* Osteopetrosis along the endosteal surface of a tibia.
* Distortions of the joint surfaces of the tail vertebrae, possibly due to osteoarthritis or developmental issues
* &quot;[E]xtensive &#x27;neoplastic&#x27; ankylosis of caudals&quot;, possibly due to physical trauma, as well as the fusion of chevrons to centra
* Coossification of vertebral centra near the end of the tail
* Amputation of a chevron and foot bone, both possibly a result of bites
* &quot;[E]xtensive exostoses&quot; in the first phalanx of the third toe
* Lesions similar to those caused by osteomyelitis in two scapulae
* Bone spurs in a premaxilla, ungual, and two metacarpals
* Exostosis in a pedal phalanx possibly attributable to an infectious disease
* A metacarpal with a round depressed fracture

==Paleoecology==
&quot;Allosaurus&quot; was the most common large theropod in the vast tract of Western American fossil-bearing rock known as the Morrison Formation, accounting for 70 to 75% of theropod specimens, and as such was at the top trophic level of the Morrison food chain. The Morrison Formation is interpreted as a semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons, and flat floodplains. Vegetation varied from river-lining forests of conifers, tree ferns, and ferns (gallery forests), to fern savannas with occasional trees such as the &quot;Araucaria&quot;-like conifer &quot;Brachyphyllum&quot;.

The Morrison Formation has been a rich fossil hunting ground. The flora of the period has been revealed by fossils of green algae, fungi, mosses, horsetails, ferns, cycads, ginkgoes, and several families of conifers. Animal fossils discovered include bivalves, snails, ray-finned fishes, frogs, salamanders, turtles, sphenodonts, lizards, terrestrial and aquatic crocodylomorphs, several species of pterosaur, numerous dinosaur species, and early mammals such as docodonts, multituberculates, symmetrodonts, and triconodonts. Dinosaurs known from the Morrison include the theropods &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;, &quot;Ornitholestes&quot;, &quot;Tanycolagreus&quot;, and &quot;Torvosaurus&quot;, the sauropods &quot;Haplocanthosaurus&quot;, &quot;Camarasaurus&quot;, &quot;Cathetosaurus&quot;, &quot;Brachiosaurus&quot;, &quot;Suuwassea&quot;, &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;, &quot;Brontosaurus&quot;, &quot;Barosaurus&quot;, &quot;Diplodocus&quot;, &quot;Supersaurus&quot;, &quot;Amphicoelias&quot;, and &quot;Maraapunisaurus&quot;, and the ornithischians &quot;Camptosaurus&quot;, &quot;Dryosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;. &quot;Allosaurus&quot; is commonly found at the same sites as &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;, &quot;Camarasaurus&quot;, &quot;Diplodocus&quot;, and &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;. The Late Jurassic formations of Portugal where &quot;Allosaurus&quot; is present are interpreted as having been similar to the Morrison, but with a stronger marine influence. Many of the dinosaurs of the Morrison Formation are the same genera as those seen in Portuguese rocks (mainly &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;, &quot;Torvosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;), or have a close counterpart (&quot;Brachiosaurus&quot; and &quot;Lusotitan&quot;, &quot;Camptosaurus&quot; and &quot;Draconyx&quot;).
&quot;Allosaurus&quot; coexisted with fellow large theropods &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; and &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; in both the United States and Portugal. The three appear to have had different ecological niches, based on anatomy and the location of fossils. &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; and &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; may have preferred to be active around waterways, and had lower, thinner bodies that would have given them an advantage in forest and underbrush terrains, whereas &quot;Allosaurus&quot; was more compact, with longer legs, faster but less maneuverable, and seems to have preferred dry floodplains. &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;, better known than &quot;Torvosaurus&quot;, differed noticeably from &quot;Allosaurus&quot; in functional anatomy by having a taller, narrower skull with large, broad teeth. &quot;Allosaurus&quot; was itself a potential food item to other carnivores, as illustrated by an &quot;Allosaurus&quot; pubic foot marked by the teeth of another theropod, probably &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; or &quot;Torvosaurus&quot;. The location of the bone in the body (along the bottom margin of the torso and partially shielded by the legs), and the fact that it was among the most massive in the skeleton, indicates that the &quot;Allosaurus&quot; was being scavenged.

A bone assemblage in the Upper Jurassic Mygatt-Moore Quarry preserves an unusually high occurrence of theropod bite marks, most of which can be attributed to &quot;Allosaurus&quot; and &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;, while others could have been made by &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; given the size of the striations. While the position of the bite marks on the herbivorous dinosaurs is consistent with predation or early access to remains, bite marks found on &quot;Allosaurus&quot; material suggest scavenging, either from the other theropods or from another &quot;Allosaurus&quot;. The unusually high concentration of theropod bite marks compared to other assemblages could be explained either by a more complete utilization of resources during a dry season by theropods, or by a collecting bias in other localities.
