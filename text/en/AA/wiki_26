<text>The age of consent is the age at which a person is considered to be legally competent to consent to sexual acts. Consequently, an adult who engages in sexual activity with a person younger than the age of consent is unable to legally claim that the sexual activity was consensual, and such sexual activity may be considered child sexual abuse or statutory rape. The person below the minimum age is considered the victim, and their sex partner the offender, although some jurisdictions provide exceptions through &quot;Romeo and Juliet laws&quot; if one or both participants are underage and are close in age.

The term &quot;age of consent&quot; typically does not appear in legal statutes. Generally, a law will establish the age below which it is illegal to engage in sexual activity with that person. It has sometimes been used with other meanings, such as the age at which a person becomes competent to consent to marriage, but consent to sexual activity is the meaning now generally understood. It should not be confused with other laws regarding age minimums including, but not limited to, the age of majority, age of criminal responsibility, voting age, drinking age, and driving age.

Age of consent laws vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, though most jurisdictions set the age of consent within the range of 14 to 18 (with the exceptions of Cuba which sets the age of consent at 12, Argentina, Niger and Western Sahara which set the age of consent at 13, Mexico which sets the age of consent between 12 and 18, and 14 Muslim states which set the consent by marriage only). The laws may also vary by the type of sexual act, the gender of the participants or other considerations, such as involving a position of trust; some jurisdictions may also make allowances for minors engaged in sexual acts with each other, rather than a single age. Charges and penalties resulting from a breach of these laws may range from a misdemeanor, such as &#x27;corruption of a minor&#x27;, to what is popularly called statutory rape.

There are many &quot;grey areas&quot; in this area of law, some regarding unspecific and untried legislation, others brought about by debates regarding changing societal attitudes, and others due to conflicts between federal and state laws. These factors all make age of consent an often confusing subject and a topic of highly charged debates.

==History and social attitudes==

===Traditional attitudes===
In traditional societies, the age of consent for a sexual union was a matter for the family to decide, or a tribal custom. In most cases, this coincided with signs of puberty, menstruation for a woman, and pubic hair for a man.

Reliable data for ages at marriage is scarce. In England, for example, the only reliable data in the early modern period comes from property records made after death. Not only were the records relatively rare, but not all bothered to record the participants&#x27; ages, and it seems that the more complete the records are, the more likely they are to reveal young marriages. Modern historians have sometimes shown reluctance to accept evidence of young ages of marriage, dismissing it as a &#x27;misreading&#x27; by a later copier of the records.

In the 12th century, Gratian, the influential compiler of canon law in medieval Europe, accepted the age of puberty for marriage to be around twelve for girls and around fourteen for boys but acknowledged consent to be meaningful if both children were older than seven years of age. There were authorities that said that such consent for entering marriage could take place earlier. Marriage would then be valid as long as neither of the two parties annulled the marital agreement before reaching puberty, or if they had already consummated the marriage. Judges sometimes honored marriages based on mutual consent at ages younger than seven: in contrast to established canon, there are recorded marriages of two- and three-year-olds.

In China, Law Code of the Reign (), published in 1202 which catalogued laws that came into effect from 1127 to 1195, introduced statutory rape in the following decree: &#x27;Successful intercourse with girls younger than 10 is considered rape in all circumstances, punishable by exile 3000 li (miles) away into the uncivilized provinces; if the rape was unsuccessful, exile by 500 li; If injury occurs in process, death by hanging&#x27;.

The first &quot;recorded&quot; age-of-consent law in Europe dates from 1275 in England; as part of its provisions on rape, the Statute of Westminster 1275 made it a misdemeanor to &quot;ravish&quot; a &quot;maiden within age,&quot; whether with or without her consent. The phrase &quot;within age&quot; was later interpreted by jurist Sir Edward Coke (England, 17th century) as meaning the age of marriage, which at the time was twelve years of age.

The Great Ming Code, 25th section, Criminal Code on Rape came into effect from 1373, raised the age of consent to 12 by stating &#x27;girls younger than 12 lack rational sexual desires, therefore any intercourse with them is considered the same as rape and therefore punishable by death with hanging&#x27;.

The American colonies followed the English tradition, and the law was more of a guide. For example, Mary Hathaway (Virginia, 1689) was only nine when she was married to William Williams. Sir Edward Coke &quot;made it clear that the marriage of girls under 12 was normal, and the age at which a girl who was a wife was eligible for a dower from her husband&#x27;s estate was 9 even though her husband be only four years old.&quot;

In the 16th century, a small number of Italian and German states set the minimum age for sexual intercourse for girls, setting it at twelve years. Towards the end of the 18th century, other European countries also began to enact similar laws. The first French Constitution of 1791 established the minimum age at eleven years. Portugal, Spain, Denmark and the Swiss cantons initially set the minimum age at ten to twelve years.

Age of consent laws were historically difficult to follow and enforce. Legal norms based on &quot;age&quot; were not, in general, common until the 19th century, because clear proof of exact age and precise date of birth were often unavailable.

In 18th-century Australia it was thought that children were inherently sinful and vulnerable to sexual temptations. Punishment for &quot;giving in&quot; to these temptations was generally left to parents and was not seen as a government matter, except in the case of rape. Australian children had few rights and were legally considered the of their parents. From the late 18th century, and especially in the 19th century, attitudes started to change. By the mid-19th century there was increased concern over child sexual abuse.

===Reforms in the 19th and 20th century===
A general shift in social and legal attitudes toward issues of sex occurred during the modern era. Attitudes on the appropriate age of permission for females to engage in sexual activity drifted toward adulthood. While ages from ten to thirteen years were typically regarded as acceptable ages for sexual consent in Western countries during the mid-19th century, by the end of the 19th century changing attitudes towards sexuality and childhood resulted in the raising of the age of consent.

English common law had traditionally set the age of consent within the range of ten to twelve years old, but the Offences Against the Person Act 1875 raised this to thirteen in Great Britain and Ireland. Early feminists of the Social Purity movement, such as Josephine Butler and others, instrumental in securing the repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts, began to turn towards the problem of child prostitution by the end of the 1870s. Sensational media revelations about the scourge of child prostitution in London in the 1880s then caused outrage among the respectable middle-classes, leading to pressure for the age of consent to be raised again.

The investigative journalist William Thomas Stead of the &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot; was pivotal in exposing the problem of child prostitution in the London underworld through a publicity stunt. In 1885 he &quot;purchased&quot; one victim, Eliza Armstrong, the thirteen-year-old daughter of a chimney sweep, for five pounds and took her to a brothel where she was drugged. He then published a series of four expos√©s entitled &quot;The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon&quot;, which shocked its readers with tales of child prostitution and the abduction, procurement, and sale of young English virgins to Continental &quot;pleasure palaces&quot;. The &quot;Maiden Tribute&quot; was an instant sensation with the reading public, and Victorian society was thrown into an uproar about prostitution. Fearing riots on a national scale, the Home Secretary, Sir William Harcourt, pleaded in vain with Stead to cease publication of the articles. A wide variety of reform groups held protest meetings and marched together to Hyde Park demanding that the age of consent be raised. The government was forced to propose the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885, which raised the age of consent from thirteen to sixteen and clamped down on prostitution.

In the United States, as late as the 1880s most states set the minimum age at ten to twelve (in Delaware, it was seven in 1895). Inspired by the &quot;Maiden Tribute&quot; articles, female reformers in the U.S. initiated their own campaign, which petitioned legislators to raise the legal minimum age to at least sixteen, with the ultimate goal to raise the age to eighteen. The campaign was successful, with almost all states raising the minimum age to between sixteen and eighteen years by 1920.

In France, Portugal, Denmark, the Swiss cantons and other countries, the minimum age was raised to between thirteen and sixteen years in the following decades. Though the original arguments for raising the age of consent were based on morality, since then the &quot;raison d&#x27;√™tre&quot; of the laws has changed to child welfare and a so-called right to childhood or innocence.

In France, under the Napoleonic Code, the age of consent was set in 1832 at eleven, and was raised to thirteen in 1863. It was increased to fifteen in 1945. In the 1970s, a group of prominent French intellectuals advocated for the repeal of the age of consent laws, but did not succeed.

In Spain, it was set in 1822 at &quot;puberty age&quot;, and changed to twelve in 1870, which was kept until 1999, when it became 13; and in 2015 it was raised to 16.

===21st century===
In the 21st century, concerns about child sex tourism and commercial sexual exploitation of children gained prominence, resulting in legislative changes in multiple jurisdictions, as well as the adoption of international laws.

The Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse (Lanzarote, 25 October 2007), and the European Union&#x27;s &quot;Directive 2011/92/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council&quot; of 13 December 2011 on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography were adopted.

The Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography came into force in 2002.

The Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children, which came into force in 2003, prohibits commercial sexual exploitation of children.

The Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (which came into force in 2008) also deals with commercial sexual exploitation of children.

Several Western countries have raised their ages of consent in recent decades. These include Canada (in 2008‚Äîfrom 14 to 16); and in Europe, Iceland (in 2007‚Äîfrom 14 to 15), Lithuania (in 2010‚Äîfrom 14 to 16), Croatia (in 2013‚Äîfrom 14 to 15), Spain (in 2015‚Äîfrom 13 to 16), Romania (in 2020 from 15 to 16) and Estonia (in 2022‚Äîfrom 14 to 16).

The International Criminal Court Statute does not provide a specific age of consent in its rape/sexual violence statute, but makes reference to sexual acts committed against persons &quot;incapable of giving genuine consent&quot;; and the explicative footnote states, &quot;It is understood that a person may be incapable of giving genuine consent if affected by natural, induced or &quot;age-related incapacity&quot;.&quot; (see note 51)

===Law===

Sexual relations with a person under the age of consent is a crime in most countries; Jurisdictions use a variety of terms for the offense, including &quot;child sexual abuse&quot;, &quot;statutory rape&quot;, &quot;illegal carnal knowledge&quot;, &quot;corruption of a minor&quot;, besides others.

The enforcement practices of age-of-consent laws vary depending on the social sensibilities of the particular culture (see above). Often, enforcement is not exercised to the letter of the law, with legal action being taken only when a sufficiently socially-unacceptable age gap exists between the two individuals, or if the perpetrator is in a position of power over the minor (e.g. a teacher, minister, or doctor). The sex of each participant can also influence perceptions of an individual&#x27;s guilt and therefore enforcement.

===Age===
The threshold age for engaging in sexual activity varies between jurisdictions. Most jurisdictions have set a fixed age of consent. However, some jurisdictions permit sex with a person after the onset of their puberty, such as Yemen, but only in marriage. Ages can also vary based on the type of calendar used, such as the lunar calendar, how birth dates in leap years are handled, or even the method by which birth date is calculated.

===Defenses and exceptions===
The age of consent is a legal barrier to the minor&#x27;s ability to consent and therefore obtaining consent is not in general a defense to having sexual relations with a person under the prescribed age, for example:

====Reasonable belief that the victim is over the age of consent====
In some jurisdictions it is a defense if the accused can show their reasonable belief that the victim was over the age of consent. However, where such a defense is provided, it normally applies only when the victim is close to the age of consent or the accused can show due diligence in determining the age of the victim (e.g. an underage person who used a fake identification document claiming to be of legal age).

====Marriage====
In various jurisdictions, age of consent laws do not apply if the parties are legally married to each other. Ruhollah Khomeini, first Supreme Leader of Iran, wrote in Tahrir al-Wasilah that sexual penetration requires the girl to be at least 9 years old, but that other sexual acts are unobjectionable regardless their age, even if they are a &quot;suckling infant&quot;.

=====Similar age=====
Some jurisdictions have laws explicitly allowing sexual acts with minors under the age of consent if their partner is close in age. In Canada, the age of consent is 16, but there are three close-in-age exemptions: sex with minors aged 14‚Äì15 is permitted if the partner is less than five years older, sex with minors aged 12‚Äì13 is permitted if the partner is less than two years older, and sex with minors aged 0‚Äì11 is permitted if the partner is 12 or 13 years of age, as long as the partner is not in a position of trust over the other minor.

=====Age under threshold=====
Another approach takes the form of a stipulation that sexual intercourse between a minor and an older partner is legal under the condition that the latter does not exceed a certain age. For example, the age of consent in the US state of Delaware is 18, but it is allowed for teenagers aged 16 and 17 to engage in sexual intercourse as long as the older partner is younger than 30. The law in Canada for sex between minors aged 0‚Äì11 with a partner younger than 14 also takes this form.

=====Similar maturity=====
Other countries state that the sexual conduct with the minor is not to be punished if the partners are of a similar age and development: for instance, the age of consent in Finland is 16, but the law states that the act will not be punished if &quot;there is no great difference in the ages or the mental and physical maturity of the persons involved&quot;. In Slovenia, the age of consent is 15, but the activity is only deemed criminal if there is &quot;a marked discrepancy between the maturity of the perpetrator and that of the victim&quot;.

====Homosexual and heterosexual age discrepancies====
Some jurisdictions, such as the Bahamas, UK overseas territory of the Cayman Islands, Paraguay and Suriname have a higher age of consent for same-sex sexual activity. However, such discrepancies are increasingly being challenged. Within Bermuda for example (since 1 November 2019 under section 177 of the Criminal Code Act 1907) the age of consent for vaginal and oral sex is 16, but for anal sex it is 18. In Canada, the United Kingdom and Western Australia, for example, the age of consent was formerly 21 for same-sex sexual activity between males (with no laws regarding lesbian sexual activities), while it was 16 for heterosexual sexual activity; this is no longer the case and the age of consent for all sexual activity is 16. In June 2019, the Canadian government repealed the section of the criminal code that set a higher age of consent for anal intercourse.

====Gender-age differentials====
In some jurisdictions (such as Indonesia), there are different ages of consent for heterosexual sexual activity that are based on the gender of each person. In countries where there are gender-age differentials, the age of consent may be higher for girls‚Äîfor example in Papua New Guinea, where the age of consent for heterosexual sex is 16 for girls and 14 for boys, or they may be higher for males, such as in Indonesia, where males must be 19 years old and females must be 16 years old. There are also numerous jurisdictions‚Äîsuch as Kuwait and the Palestinian Territories‚Äîin which marriage laws govern the gender-age differential. In these jurisdictions, it is illegal to have sexual intercourse outside of marriage, so the &quot;de facto&quot; age of consent is the marriageable age. In Kuwait, this means that boys must be at least 17 and girls at least 15 years old.

====Position of authority/trust====
In most jurisdictions where the age of consent is below 18 (such as England and Wales), in cases where a person aged 18 or older is in a position of trust over a person under 18, the age of consent usually rises to 18 or higher. Examples of such positions of trust include relationships between teachers and students. For example, in England and Wales the age of consent is 16, but if the person is a student of the older person it becomes¬†18.

====Circumstances of the relationship====
In several jurisdictions, it is illegal to engage in sexual activity with a person under a certain age under certain circumstances regarding the relationship in question, such as if it involves taking advantage of or corrupting the morals of the young person. For example, while the age of consent is 14 in Germany and 16 in Canada, it is illegal in both countries to engage in sexual activity with a person under 18 if the activity exploits the younger person. Another example is in Mexico, where there is a crime called &quot;estupro&quot; defined as sexual activity with a person over the age of consent but under a certain age limit (generally 18) in which consent of the younger person was obtained through seduction and/or deceit. In Pennsylvania, the age of consent is officially 16, but if the older partner is 18 or older, they may still be prosecuted for corruption of minors for their corruption or tending to corrupt the morals of the younger person.

===Extraterritoriality===

A growing number of countries have specific extraterritorial legislation that prosecutes their citizens in their homeland should they engage in illicit sexual conduct in a foreign country with children. In 2008, ECPAT reported that 44 countries had extraterritorial child sex legislation. For example, PROTECT Act of 2003, a federal United States law bans sexual activity by its citizens with foreigners or with U.S. citizens from another state, if the partner is under 18 and the activity is illegal under the federal, state, or local law. This applies in cases where any of the partners travels into or out of the United States, or from one state into another, for the purpose of an illegal sexual encounter.

==Other issues==

===Gender of participants===
There is debate as to whether the gender of those involved should lead to different treatment of the sexual encounter, in law or in practice. Traditionally, age of consent laws regarding vaginal intercourse were often meant to protect the chastity of unmarried girls. Many feminists and social campaigners in the 1970s have objected to the social importance of virginity, and have also attempted to change the stereotypes of female passivity and male aggression; demanding that the law protect children from exploitation regardless of their gender, rather than dealing with concerns of chastity. This has led to gender-neutral laws in many jurisdictions. On the other hand, there is an opposing view which argues that the act of vaginal intercourse is an &quot;unequal act&quot; for males and females, due to issues such as pregnancy, increased risk of STDs, and risk of physical injury if the girl is too young and not physically ready. In the US, in &quot;Michael M. v. Superior Ct.450 U.S. 464 (1981)&quot; it was ruled that the double standard of offering more legal protection to girls is valid because &quot;the Equal Protection Clause does not mean that the physiological differences between men and women must be disregarded&quot;.

Traditionally, many age of consent laws dealt primarily with men engaging in sexual acts with underage girls and boys (the latter acts often falling under sodomy and buggery laws). This means that in some legal systems, issues of women having sexual contact with underage partners were rarely acknowledged. For example, until 2000, in the UK, before the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000, there was no statutory age of consent for lesbian sex. In New Zealand, before 2005, there were no age of consent laws dealing with women having sex with underage boys. Previously, in Fiji, male offenders of child sexual abuse could receive up to life imprisonment, whilst female offenders would receive up to seven years. Situations like these have been attributed to societal views on traditional gender roles, and to constructs of male sexuality and female sexuality; according to E Martellozzo, &quot;[V]iewing females as perpetrators of sexual abuse goes against every stereotype that society has of women: women as mothers and caregivers and not as people who abuse and harm&quot;. Alissa Nutting argues that women are not acknowledged as perpetrators of sex crimes because society does not accept that women have an autonomous sexuality of their own.

===Marriage and the age of consent===

The age at which a person can be legally married can differ from the age of consent. In jurisdictions where the marriageable age is lower than the age of consent, those laws usually override the age of consent laws in the case of a married couple where one or both partners are below the age of consent. Some jurisdictions prohibit all sex outside of marriage irrespective of age, as in the case of Yemen.

===Prostitution===

In many countries, there are specific laws dealing with child prostitution.

===Pornography and &quot;jailbait&quot; images===
In some countries, states, or other jurisdictions, the age of consent may be lower than the age at which a person can appear in pornographic images and films. In many jurisdictions, the minimum age for participation and even viewing such material is 18. As such, in some jurisdictions, films and images showing individuals under the age of 18, but above the age of consent, that meet the legal definition of child pornography are prohibited despite the fact that the sexual acts depicted are legal to engage in otherwise under that jurisdiction&#x27;s age of consent laws. In those cases, it is only the filming of the sex act that is the crime as the act itself would not be considered a sex crime. For example, in the United States under federal law it is a crime to film minors below 18 in sexual acts, even in states where the age of consent is below 18. In those states, charges such as child pornography can be used to prosecute someone having sex with a minor, who could not otherwise be prosecuted for statutory rape, provided they filmed or photographed the act.

Jailbait images can be differentiated from child pornography, as they do not feature minors before the onset of puberty, nor do they contain nudity. The images are, however, usually sexualized, often featuring tween or young teenagers in bikinis, skirts, underwear or lingerie. Whether or not these images are legal is debated. When questioned regarding their legality legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin stated he thought it was not illegal, though legal expert Sunny Hostin was more skeptical, describing jailbait images as &quot;borderline&quot; child pornography which may be illegal.

===Health===

The human immune system continues to develop after puberty. The age of exposure has an influence upon if the immune system can fend off infections in general, and this is also true in the case of some sexually transmitted diseases. For example, a risk factor for HPV strains causing genital warts is sexual debut at a young age; if this extends to the cancer causing strains, then sexual debut at a young age would potentially also increase risk of persistence of HPV infections that cause the very HPV induced cancers that are being diagnosed in spiking numbers of relatively young people.

==Initiatives to change the age of consent==

Age-of-consent reform refers to the efforts of some individuals or groups, for different reasons, to alter or abolish age-of-consent laws. These efforts advocate positions such as:
* Introductions of close-in-age exceptions.
* Reducing the age-of-consent for homosexual activity to match that of heterosexual activity.
* A change in the way that age-of-consent laws are examined in court.
* Either increases in the ages of consent or more severe penalties or both.
* Either decreases in the ages of consent or less severe penalties or both.
* Abolition of the age-of-consent laws either permanently or as a temporary, practical expedient.

<text>Alypius of Antioch was a geographer and a vicarius of Roman Britain, probably in the late 350s AD. He replaced Flavius Martinus after that vicarius&#x27; suicide. His rule is recorded is Ammianus XXIII 1, 3.

==Life==
He came from Antioch and served under Constantius II and was probably appointed to ensure that nobody with western associations was serving in Britain during a time of mistrust, rebellion and suppression symbolised by the brutal acts of the imperial notary Paulus Catena. He may have had to deal with the insurrection of the usurper named Carausius II.

Alypius was afterwards commissioned to rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem as part of Julian&#x27;s systematic attempt to reverse the Christianization of the Roman Empire by restoring pagan and, in this case, Jewish practices. Among the letters of Julian are two (29 and 30) addressed to Alypius; one inviting him to Rome, the other thanking him for a geographical treatise, which no longer exists.

<doc id="1655" wikidata="Q371670" url="?curid=1655" title="Amalasuintha">
<text>Amalasuintha (495 ‚Äì 30 April 535) was a ruler of the Ostrogothic Kingdom from 526 to 535. Initially serving as regent for her son Athalaric, she became queen after his premature death. Highly educated, Amalasuintha was praised by both Cassiodorus and Procopius for her wisdom and her ability to speak three languages (Greek, Gothic, and Latin). Her status as an independent female monarch, and obvious affinity for Roman culture, caused discontent among the Gothic nobles in her court, and she was deposed and killed after six months of sole rule. Eastern Roman emperor Justinian I used her death as a casus belli to invade Italy, setting off the Gothic War.

== Family ==
Amalasuintha was likely born in Ravenna in 495, the only child of Theodoric and his wife Audofleda, the sister of Clovis, King of the Franks. The union of Amalasuintha&#x27;s parents were of a political purpose, as many royal marriages were at the time. Theodoric married Audofleda about the year 493, after he had defeated the various Gothic kingdoms and sought an alliance with the Franks. Amalasuintha was born into the Amali dynasty on her father&#x27;s side, which dynasty comprised Goths of Germanic descent. Like her father, Amalasuintha was married out of political reasons to Eutharic, an Amali prince, to ensure a legitimate heir to the throne. They had two children together, Athalaric and Matasuntha. Eutharic died in 522, causing Theodoric some alarm, as his kingdom lacked an adult male heir to inherit the throne. As Amalasuintha&#x27;s son Athalaric was only 10 years old at the time of Theodoric&#x27;s death, Amalasuintha took control of the kingdom alongside her son as regent and, although accounts by Cassiodorus and Procopius refer to Athalaric as King, she effectively ruled on his behalf.

==Rule==
===Regent===
According to Procopius, the Goth aristocracy wanted Athalaric to be raised in the Gothic manner, but Amalasuintha wanted him to resemble the Roman princes. Amalasuintha had close ties to the Byzantine emperor Justinian I, which would have made her adherence to Roman learning and customs especially objectionable to her fellow Goths. The regency lasted until 534, when Athalaric died from what was most likely the combination of excessive drinking (a part of Gothic culture) and a disease, probably diabetes. In order to secure the power in the Amali name, Amalasuintha created the consortium regni that allowed her to continue to rule as queen while still presenting a public face that honored conservative Gothic tradition. She then appointed her older cousin Theodahad to rule as co-regent, in which Amalasuintha would play the male character and Theodahad would play the woman, as male and female monarchs sharing powers. Masculinity is the main characteristic attributed to Amalasuintha by Procopius and Cassiodorus, because she had a strong determination and temperament.

Her tremendous influence in her position as regent can be seen in a diptych of Rufius Gennadius Probus Orestes in which she appears alongside her son, Athalaric, in 530. Deeply imbued with the old Roman culture, she gave to her son&#x27;s education a more refined and literary turn than suited her Goth subjects. Conscious of her unpopularity, she banished ‚Äì and afterwards put to death ‚Äì three Gothic nobles whom she suspected of conspiring against her rule. At the same time, she opened negotiations with Justinian, with the view of removing herself and the Gothic treasure to Constantinople.

===Queen regnant===
After Athalaric&#x27;s death, Amalasuintha became queen and ruled alone for a short while before making her cousin Theodahad co-ruler with the intent of strengthening her position. Theodahad was a prominent leader of the Gothic military aristocracy that opposed her pro-Roman stances, and Amalasuintha believed this duumvirate might make supporters from her harshest critics. Instead Theodahad fostered the disaffection of the Goths, and had Amalasuintha imprisoned on the island of Martana in Lake Bolsena.

==Death==

While imprisoned by her co-regent Theodahad, Amalasuintha was murdered while bathing on 30 April 535. The death of Amalasuintha was used by Justinian I as a reason to go to war with the Ostrogoths and attempt to reclaim Italy for the Roman Empire. According to the Eastern Roman historian Procopius, Amalasuintha was thinking about handing over Italy to Justinian around the time of her death. There is some evidence to suggest that the Byzantine Empress Theodora arranged to have Amalasuintha murdered, by conspiring with Theodahad through Justinian&#x27;s ambassador Peter the Illyrian. It has been suggested by Procopius that Theodora viewed Amalasuintha as a potential love rival and threat to her position as Empress. However, modern scholarship has contended that Theodora was acting on Justinian&#x27;s behalf in arranging Amalasuintha&#x27;s murder as it gave him clear justification to attack Theodahad. 

In 536, Theodahad was deposed by Witigis, who had forcibly married Amalasuintha&#x27;s daughter Matasuntha. With the people&#x27;s support, Witigis had Theodahad put to death.

== Sources ==
The letters of Cassiodorus, chief minister and literary adviser of Amalasuintha, and the histories of Procopius and Jordanes, give us our chief information as to the character of Amalasuintha. Cassiodorus was a part of a greater pro-Roman party that desired to Romanize the traditional Ostrogothic kingship, further evidence of the pro-Roman circle that Amalasuintha surrounded herself with.

==Legacy==
=== Arts ===
The life of Amalasuintha was made the subject of a tragedy, the first play written by the young Carlo Goldoni and presented at Milan in 1733.

Romanian poet George Co»ôbuc wrote a poem entitled &quot;Regina Ostrogotilor (The Queen of the Ostrogoths)&quot; in which Amalasuintha (as Amalasunda) speaks to Theodahad (mentioned as Teodat in the poem) shortly before he kills her.

Amalasuintha is portrayed by Honor Blackman in the 1968 film &quot;Kampf um Rom&quot;. Her character is suffocated to death in a locked bath house.&quot;&quot;

=== Eponymy ===
Asteroid 650 Amalasuntha is named in her honour. &quot;Ranunculus amalasuinthae&quot; is a microspecies of &quot;Ranunculus auricomus&quot; known from Pomerania, among others from a site situated not far from the cemetery of Goths near Grzybnica.

<text>Amalric of Bena (; ; died ) was a French theologian, philosopher and sect leader, after whom the Amalricians are named. Reformers such as Martin Luther considered him to be a proto-Protestant.

==Biography==
Amalric was born in the latter part of the 12th century at Bennes, a village between Oll√© and Chauffours in the diocese of Chartres.

Amalric taught philosophy and theology at the University of Paris and enjoyed a great reputation as a subtle dialectician; his lectures developing the philosophy of Aristotle attracted a large audience. In 1204 his doctrines were condemned by the university and, on a personal appeal to Pope Innocent III, the sentence was ratified, Amalric being ordered to return to Paris and recant his errors.

His death was caused, it is said, by grief at the humiliation to which he had been subjected.
In 1209, ten of his followers were burnt before the gates of Paris and Amalric&#x27;s own body was exhumed and burnt and the ashes given to the winds. The doctrines of his followers, known as the Amalricians, were formally condemned by the fourth Lateran Council in 1215.

==Propositions==
Amalric appears to have derived his philosophical system from a selective reading of Eriugena, whose expressions he developed in a one-sided and strongly pantheistic form. 

Only three propositions can be attributed to him with certainty:
#that God is all (&quot;omnia sunt deus&quot;) and thus all things are one because whatever is, is God (&quot;omnia unum, quia quidquid est, est Deus&quot;);
#that every Christian is bound to believe that he is a member of the body of Christ, and that this belief is necessary for salvation;
#that he who remains in love of God can commit no sin.

Because of the first proposition, God himself is thought to be invisible and only recognizable in his creation.

These three propositions were further developed by his followers, who maintained that God revealed Himself in a threefold revelation, the first in the Biblical patriarch Abraham, marking the &quot;epoch of the Father&quot;; the second in Jesus Christ, who began the &quot;epoch of the Son&quot;; and the third in Amalric and his disciples, who inaugurated the &quot;era of the Holy Ghost.&quot;

Amalricians taught:
*Hell is ignorance, therefore Hell is within all men, &quot;like a bad tooth in a mouth&quot;;
*God is identical with all that is, even evil belongs to God and proves God&#x27;s omnipotence;
*A man who knows that God works through everything cannot sin, because every human act is then the act of God;
*A man who recognizes the truth that God works through everything is already in Heaven and this is the only resurrection. There is no other life; man&#x27;s fulfillment is in this life alone.

Due to persecutions, this sect does not appear to have long survived the death of its founder. Not long after the burning of ten of their members (1210), the sect itself lost its importance, while some of the surviving Amalricians became Brethren of the Free Spirit.

According to Hosea Ballou, then Pierre Batiffol and George T. Knight (1914) Amalric believed that all people would eventually be saved and this was one of the counts upon which he was declared a heretic by Pope Innocent III.

<text>Afonso I (; 1106/1109/11111185), also called Afonso Henriques, nicknamed the Conqueror () and the Founder () by the Portuguese, was the first king of Portugal. He achieved the independence of the County of Portugal, establishing a new kingdom and doubling its area with the &quot;&quot;, an objective that he pursued until his death.

Afonso was the son of Theresa of Le√≥n and Henry of Burgundy, rulers of the County of Portugal. Henry died in 1112, leaving Theresa to rule alone. Unhappy with Theresa&#x27;s romantic relationship with Galician Fernando P√©rez de Traba and his political influence, the Portuguese nobility rallied around Afonso, who revolted and defeated his mother at the Battle of S√£o Mamede in 1128 and became sole Count of Portugal soon afterwards. In 1139, Afonso renounced the suzerainty of the Kingdom of Le√≥n and established the independent Kingdom of Portugal.

Afonso actively campaigned against the Moors in the south. In 1139 he won a decisive victory at the Battle of Ourique, and in 1147 he seized Santar√©m and Lisbon from the Moors, with help from men on their way to the Holy Land for the Second Crusade. He secured the independence of Portugal following a victory over Le√≥n at Valdevez and received papal approval through &quot;Manifestis Probatum&quot;. Afonso died in 1185 and was succeeded by his son, Sancho I.

==Early life==
Afonso was the son of Theresa, the illegitimate daughter of King Alfonso VI of Le√≥n, and her husband, Henry of Burgundy. He was the youngest of 4 children, with the oldest being Urraca Henriques. According to the &#x27; the future Portuguese king was born in Guimar√£es, which was at the time the most important political centre of his parents. This was accepted by most Portuguese scholars until 1990, when Torquato de Sousa Soares proposed Coimbra, the centre of the county of Coimbra and another political centre of Afonso&#x27;s progenitors, as his birthplace, which caused outrage in Guimar√£es and a polemic between this historian and Jos√© Hermano Saraiva. Almeida Fernandes later proposed Viseu as the birthplace of Afonso based on the &#x27;, which states Afonso was born in 1109, a position followed by historian Jos√© Mattoso in his biography of the king, regardless of this, it is widely accepted that Afonso was born in Guimar√£es. Abel Estef√¢nio has suggested a different date and thesis, proposing 1106 as the birth date and the region of Tierra de Campos or even Sahag√∫n as likely birthplaces based on the known itineraries of Henry and Theresa. His place of baptism is also under suspicion: according to tradition the place is indicated as being in the Church of S√£o Miguel do Castelo, in Guimar√£es; however, there are doubts because of the date of the consecration of the Church, made in 1239. There are those who argue that the baptism actually took place in the Cathedral of Braga where he was baptised by Primate Archbishop Saint Gerald of Braga, which is politically sound for Count Henry to have the highest-ranking clergy baptise his heir.

Henry and Theresa reigned jointly as count and countess of Portugal until his death on 22 May 1112 during the siege of Astorga, after which Theresa ruled Portugal alone. She would proclaim herself queen (a claim recognised by Pope Paschal II in 1116) but was captured and forced to reaffirm her vassalage to her half-sister, Urraca of Le√≥n.

It is not known who was the tutor of Afonso. Later traditions, probably started with Jo√£o Soares Coelho (a bastard descendant of Egas Moniz through a female line) in the mid-13th century and ampliated by later chronicles such as the &quot;&quot;, asserted he had been Egas Moniz de Ribadouro, possibly with the help of oral memories that associated the tutor to the house of Ribadouro. Yet, contemporary documents, namely from the chancery of Afonso in his early years as count of Portucale, indicate according to Mattoso that the most likely tutor of Afonso Henriques was Egas Moniz&#x27;s oldest brother, Erm√≠gio Moniz, who, besides being the senior brother within the family of Ribadouro, became the &quot;dapifer&quot; and &quot;majordomus&quot; of Afonso I from 1128 until his death in 1135, which indicates his closer proximity to the prince.

In an effort to pursue a larger share in the Leonese inheritance, his mother Theresa joined forces with Fernando P√©rez de Trava, the most powerful count in Galicia. The Portuguese nobility disliked the alliance between Galicia and Portugal and rallied around Afonso. The Archbishop of Braga, Maurice Bourdin, was also concerned with the dominance of Galicia, apprehensive of the ecclesiastical pretensions of his new rival the Galician Archbishop of Santiago de Compostela, Diego Gelm√≠rez, who had claimed an alleged discovery of relics of Saint James in his town, as a way to gain power and riches over the other cathedrals in the Iberian Peninsula. In order to stop her son Afonso from overthrowing her, Theresa exiled him when he was twelve in the year 1120. In 1122, Afonso turned fourteen, the adult age in the 12th century. In symmetry with his cousin, Afonso made himself a knight on his own account in the Cathedral of Zamora in 1125. After the military campaign of Alfonso VII against his mother in 1127, Afonso revolted against her and proceeded to take control of the county from its queen.

== Path to sole rulership ==

In 1128, near Guimar√£es at the Battle of S√£o Mamede, Afonso and his supporters overcame troops under both his mother and her lover, Count Fernando P√©rez de Traba of Galicia. Afonso exiled his mother to Galicia, and took over rule of the County of Portucale. Thus the possibility of re-incorporating Portucale into a Kingdom of Portugal and Galicia as before was eliminated and Afonso became sole ruler following demands for greater independence from the county&#x27;s church and nobles. The battle was mostly ignored by the Leonese suzerain, who was occupied at the time with a revolt in Castile. He was also, most likely, waiting for the reaction of the Galician families. After Theresa&#x27;s death in 1131, Alfonso VII of Le√≥n proceeded to demand vassalage from his cousin. On 6 April 1129, Afonso Henriques dictated the writ in which he proclaimed himself Prince of Portugal or Prince of the Portuguese, an act informally allowed by Alfonso VII, as it was thought to be Afonso Henriques&#x27;s right by blood, as one of two grandsons of the Emperor of Hispania.

Afonso then turned his arms against the persistent problem of the Moors in the south. His campaigns were successful and, on 25 July 1139, he obtained an overwhelming victory in the Battle of Ourique, and straight after was (possibly unanimously) proclaimed King of the Portuguese by his soldiers, establishing his equality in rank to the other realms of the Peninsula, although the first reference to his royal title dates from 1140. The first assembly of the Portuguese Cortes convened at Lamego (wherein he would have been given the crown from the Archbishop of Braga, to confirm his independence) is a 17th-century embellishment of Portuguese history.

== Reign ==
Complete independence from Alfonso VII of Le√≥n&#x27;s suzerainty, however, could not be achieved by military means alone. The County of Portugal still had to be acknowledged diplomatically by the neighboring lands as a kingdom and, most importantly, by the Catholic Church and the pope. Afonso wed Mafalda of Savoy, daughter of Count Amadeus III of Savoy, and sent ambassadors to Rome to negotiate with the pope. He succeeded in renouncing the suzerainty of his cousin, Alfonso VII of Le√≥n, becoming instead a vassal of the papacy, as the kings of Sicily and Aragon had done before him. 

In Portugal he built several monasteries and convents and bestowed important privileges to religious orders. He is notably the builder of Alcoba√ßa Monastery, to which he called the Cistercian Order of his uncle Bernard of Clairvaux of Burgundy. In 1143, he wrote to Pope Innocent II to declare himself and the kingdom servants of the church, swearing to pursue driving the Moors out of the Iberian Peninsula. Bypassing any king of Le√≥n, Afonso declared himself the direct of the papacy. Afonso continued to distinguish himself by his exploits against the Moors, from whom he wrested Santar√©m (see Conquest of Santar√©m) and Lisbon in 1147 (see Siege of Lisbon). He also conquered an important part of the land south of the Tagus River, although this was lost again to the Moors in the following years.

Meanwhile, King Alfonso VII of Le√≥n regarded the independent ruler of Portugal as nothing but a rebel. Conflict between the two was constant and bitter in the following years. Afonso became involved in a war, taking the side of the Aragonese king, an enemy of Castile. To ensure the alliance, his son Sancho was engaged to Dulce of Aragon. Finally after winning the Battle of Valdevez, the Treaty of Zamora (1143) established peace between the cousins and the recognition by the Kingdom of Le√≥n that Portugal was a fully independent kingdom.

In 1169 the now old King Afonso was possibly disabled in an engagement near Badajoz, by a fall from his horse and slamming against the castle gate, and made prisoner by the soldiers of King Ferdinand II of Le√≥n, his son-in-law. He spent months at the hot springs of S√£o Pedro do Sul, but never recovered and from this time onward the Portuguese king never rode a horse again. However, it is not certain if this was because of the disability: according to the later Portuguese chronistic tradition, this happened because Afonso would have to surrender himself again to Ferdinand or risk war between the two kingdoms if he ever rode a horse again. Portugal was obliged to surrender as his ransom almost all the conquests Afonso had made in Galicia (north of the Minho River) in the previous years. This event became known in Portuguese history as the Disaster of Badajoz (&quot;o Desastre de Badajoz&quot;). 
In 1179 the privileges and favors given to the Catholic Church were compensated. With consistent effort by several parties, such as the primate archbishop of Braga, Paio Mendes, in the papal court, the papal bull &quot;Manifestis Probatum&quot; was promulgated accepting the new king as vassal to the pope exclusively. In it Pope Alexander III also acknowledged Afonso as king and Portugal as an independent kingdom with the right to conquer lands from the Moors.

In 1184, the Almohad caliph Abu Yaqub Yusuf rallied a great Almohad force to retaliate against the Portuguese raids done since the end of a five-year truce in 1178 and besieged Santar√©m, which was defended by Afonso&#x27;s son Sancho. The Almohad siege failed when news arrived the archbishop of Compostella had come to the defense of the city and Fernando II of Le√≥n himself with his army. The Almohads ended the siege and their retreat turned into a rout due to panic in their camp, with the Almohad caliph being injured in the process (according to one version, because of a crossbow bolt) and dying on the way back to Seville. Afonso died shortly after on 6 December 1185. The Portuguese revere him as a hero, both on account of his personal character and as the founder of their nation. There are mythical stories that it took ten men to carry his sword, and that Afonso wanted to engage other monarchs in personal combat, but no one would dare accept his challenge. It is also told, despite his honourable character, that he had a temper. Several chronicles give the example of a papal legate that brought a message from Pope Paschal II refusing to acknowledge Afonso&#x27;s claim as king: either after committing or saying a small offense against him or after being simply read the letter, Afonso almost killed, in his rage, the papal representative, and it took several Portuguese nobles and soldiers to physically restrain the young would-be king.

==Scientific research==

In July 2006, the tomb of the king (which is located in the Santa Cruz Monastery in Coimbra) was to be opened for scientific purposes by researchers from the University of Coimbra (Portugal) and the University of Granada (Spain). The opening of the tomb provoked considerable concern among some sectors of Portuguese society and Portuguese State Agency for Architectural Patrimony (&quot;Instituto Portugu√™s do Patrim√≥nio Arquitect√≥nico&quot; ‚Äì IPPAR) halted the opening, requesting more protocols from the scientific team because of the importance of the king in the nation&#x27;s heart and public thought.

==Family==
In 1146, Afonso married Mafalda, daughter of Amadeus III, Count of Savoy and Mahaut of Albon, both appearing together for the first time in May of that year confirming royal charters. They had the following issue:

* Henry (5 March 1147 ‚Äì 1155) named after his paternal grandfather, Henry, Count of Portugal, he died when he was only eight years old. Despite being just a child he represented his father at a council in Toledo at the age of three;
* Urraca (1148‚Äì1211), married King Ferdinand II of Le√≥n and was the mother of King Alfonso IX. The marriage was subsequently annulled in 1171 or 1172 and she retired in Zamora, one of the villas that she had received as part of her &quot;arras&quot;, and later at the Monastery of Santa Mar√≠a in Wamba, Valladolid where she was buried;
* Teresa (1151‚Äì1218), countess consort of Flanders due to her marriage to Philip I and duchess consort of Burgundy through her second marriage to Odo III;
* Mafalda (1153after 1162). In January 1160, her father and Ram√≥n Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona, negotiated the marriage of Mafalda to Alfonso, future King Alfonso II of Aragon who at that time was three or four years old. After the death of Ram√≥n Berenguer IV in the summer of 1162, King Ferdinand II of Le√≥n convinced his widow, Queen Petronilla, to cancel the infante&#x27;s wedding plans with Mafalda and for Alfonso to marry instead Sancha, daughter of Alfonso VII of Le√≥n and his second wife Queen Richeza of Poland. Mafalda died in her childhood at an unrecorded date.
* Sancho, the future King Sancho I of Portugal (11 November 115426 March 1211). He was baptised with the name of Martin for having been born on the saint&#x27;s feast day;
* John (1156‚Äì25 August 1164); and
* Sancha (1157‚Äì14 February 1166/67), born ten days before the death of her mother, Sancha died before reaching the age of ten on 14 February according to the death registry at the Monastery of Santa Cruz (Coimbra) where she was buried.

Before his marriage to Mafalda, King Afonso fathered his first son with Chamoa G√≥mez, daughter of Count G√≥mez N√∫√±ez and Elvira P√©rez, sister of Fernando and Bermudo P√©rez de Traba:

* Afonso (1140‚Äì1207). Born around 1140, according to recent investigations, he is the same person as the one often called Fernando Afonso who was the &quot;alferes-mor&quot; of the king and later Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller. His presence in the court is first recorded in 1159. In 1169 he succeeded as alferes-mor his half-brother, Pedro Pais da Maia, the legitimate son of his mother and Paio Soares da Maia.

The extramarital offspring by Elvira G√°lter were:
* Urraca Afonso. In 1185, her father gave her Av√¥, stipulating that this villa was to be inherited only by the children that she had with her husband Pedro Afonso de Ribadouro (also known as Pedro Afonso Viegas), grandson of Egas Moniz, which could indicate another previous or subsequent marriage. In 1187, she exchanged with her half-brother, King Sancho, this villa for Aveiro. She died after 1216, the year she made a donation to the Monastery of Tarouca.
* Teresa Afonso. In some genealogies she appears as the daughter of Elvira G√°lter, and in others as the daughter of Chamoa G√≥mez. Her first marriage was with Sancho Nunes de Barbosa with whom she had a daughter, Urraca Sanches, who married Gon√ßalo Mendes de Sousa, the father of Mendo Gon√ßalves de Sousa known as &quot;Sous√£o&quot;. Her second husband was Fernando Martins Bravo, Lord of Bragan√ßa and Chaves, with no issue from this marriage.

King Afonso was also the father of:
* Pedro Afonso (died after 1183), Lord of Arega and Pedr√≥g√£o, mayor of Abrantes in 1179, &quot;alferes&quot; of King Afonso I between 1181 and 1183, and Master of the Order of Aviz.

Afonso succeeded his father on 27 March 1211.

==Reign==

As a king, Afonso II set a different approach of government. Hitherto, his father Sancho I and his grandfather Afonso I were mostly concerned with military issues either against the neighbouring Kingdom of Castile or against the Moorish lands in the south. Afonso did not pursue territory enlargement policies and managed to ensure peace with Castile during his reign. Despite this, some towns were conquered from the Moors by the private initiative of noblemen and clergy, as when Bishop Soeiro Viegas initiated the conquest of Alc√°cer do Sal. This does not mean that he was a weak or somehow cowardly man. The first years of his reign were marked instead by internal disturbances between Afonso and his brothers and sisters. The king managed to keep security within Portuguese borders only by outlawing and exiling his kin.

Since military issues were not a government priority, Afonso established the state&#x27;s administration and centralized power on himself. He designed the first set of Portuguese written laws. These were mainly concerned with private property, civil justice, and minting. Afonso also sent ambassadors to European kingdoms outside the Iberian Peninsula and began amicable commercial relations with most of them.

In 1220, Afonso instituted inquiri√ß√µes to investigate the nature of holdings and to recover whatever had been illegally taken from the crown. This issue was in response to the church&#x27;s rein over Portuguese land as they supported Afonso&#x27;s fight in the civil war with Sancho II. These included examination of local noble titles and rights, including investigation of properties, lands and incomes against royal charters that had been issued.

Other reforms included the always delicate matters with the pope. In order to get the independence of Portugal recognized by Rome, his grandfather, Afonso I, had to legislate an enormous number of privileges to the Church. These eventually created a state within the state. With Portugal&#x27;s position as a country firmly established, Afonso II endeavoured to weaken the power of the clergy and to apply a portion of the enormous revenues of the Catholic Church to purposes of national utility. These actions led to a serious diplomatic conflict between the pope and Portugal. After being excommunicated for his audacities by Pope Honorius III, Afonso II promised to make amends to the church, but he died in Coimbra on 25 March 1223 before making any serious attempts to do so.

King Afonso was buried originally at the Monastery of Santa Cruz in Coimbra where his body remained for nearly ten years. His remains were transferred subsequently to Alcoba√ßa Monastery, as he had stipulated in his will. He and his wife, Queen Urraca, were buried at its Royal Pantheon.

==Marriage and descendants==
In 1206, he married Urraca, daughter of Alfonso VIII of Castile and Eleanor of England. The couple were both descendants of King Alfonso VI of Le√≥n. The offspring of this marriage were:

* Sancho II (8 September 12074 January 1248), king of Portugal; 
* Afonso III (5 May 121016 February 1279), king of Portugal;
* Eleanor (1211‚Äì1231), queen of Denmark
* Ferdinand (1218‚Äì1246), lord of Serpa

Out of wedlock, he had two illegitimate sons:
* Jo√£o Afonso (d. 9 October 1234), buried in the Alcoba√ßa monastery;
* Pedro Afonso (d. after 1249), who accompanied his brother King Afonso in the conquest of Faro in 1249. He had an illegitimate daughter named Constan√ßa Peres.

<doc id="1659" wikidata="Q295850" url="?curid=1659" title="Afonso III of Portugal">
<text>Afonso III (; 5 May 121016 February 1279), called the Boulonnais (Port. &quot;o Bolonh√™s&quot;), was King of Portugal and the first to use the title &quot;King of Portugal and the Algarve&quot;, from 1249. He was the second son of King Afonso II of Portugal and his wife, Urraca of Castile; he succeeded his brother, King Sancho II of Portugal, who died on 4 January 1248.

==Early life==
Afonso was born in Coimbra. As the second son of King Afonso II of Portugal, he was not expected to inherit the throne, which was destined to go to his elder brother Sancho.

He lived mostly in France, where he married Countess Matilda II of Boulogne in 1238, thereby becoming count of Boulogne, Mortain, Aumale and Dammartin-en-Go√´le &quot;jure uxoris&quot;.

==Reign==
In 1245, conflicts between his brother, the king, and the church became unbearable. Pope Innocent IV ordered Sancho II to be removed from the throne and to be replaced by the Count of Boulogne. Afonso did not refuse the papal order and consequently marched to Portugal. Since Sancho was not a popular king the order was not hard to enforce, and he fled into exile to Toledo, Castile, where he died on 4 January 1248. Until his brother&#x27;s death and his own eventual coronation, Afonso retained and used the title of &quot;Visitador, Curador e Defensor do Reino&quot; (Overseer, Curator and Defender of the Kingdom).

In order to ascend the throne Afonso abdicated his rights to the county of Boulogne in 1248. In 1253, he divorced Matilda in order to marry Beatrice of Castile, illegitimate daughter of Alfonso X, King of Castile, and Mayor Guill√©n de Guzm√°n.

Determined not to make the same mistakes as his brother, Afonso III paid special attention to what the middle class, composed of merchants and small land owners, had to say. In 1254, in the city of Leiria, he held the first session of the &quot;Cortes&quot;, a general assembly comprising the nobility, the middle class and representatives of all municipalities. He also made laws intended to restrain the upper classes from abusing the least favored part of the population. Remembered as a notable administrator, Afonso III founded several towns, granted the title of city to many others and reorganized public administration.

Afonso showed extraordinary vision for the time. Progressive measures taken during his kingship include: representatives of the commons, besides the nobility and clergy, were involved in governance; the end of preventive arrests such that henceforward all arrests had to be first presented to a judge to determine the detention measure; and fiscal innovation, such as negotiating extraordinary taxes with the mercantile classes and direct taxation of the Church, rather than debasement of the coinage. These may have led to his excommunication by the Holy See and possibly precipitated his death, and his son Denis&#x27;s premature rise to the throne at only 18 years old.

Secure on the throne, Afonso III then proceeded to make war with the Muslim communities that still thrived in the south. In his reign the Algarve became part of the kingdom, following the capture of Faro.

===Final years and death===
Following his success against the Moors, Afonso III had to deal with a political situation concerning the country&#x27;s borders with Castile. The neighbouring kingdom considered that the newly acquired lands of the Algarve should be Castilian, not Portuguese, which led to a series of wars between the two kingdoms. Finally, in 1267, the Treaty of Badajoz was signed in Badajoz, determining that the southern border between Castile and Portugal should be the River Guadiana, as it is today.

Afonso died in Alcoba√ßa, Coimbra or Lisbon, aged 68.

==Marriages and descendants==
Afonso&#x27;s first wife was Matilda II, Countess of Boulogne, daughter of Renaud, Count of Dammartin, and Ida, Countess of Boulogne. They had no surviving children. He divorced Matilda in 1253 and, in the same year, married Beatrice of Castile, illegitimate daughter of Alfonso X, King of Castile, and Mayor Guill√©n de Guzm√°n.

<doc id="1660" wikidata="Q272903" url="?curid=1660" title="Afonso IV of Portugal">
<text>Afonso IV (; 8 February 129128 May 1357), called the Brave (), was King of Portugal from 1325 until his death in 1357. He was the only legitimate son of King Denis of Portugal and Elizabeth of Aragon.

== Early life ==
Afonso, born in Lisbon, was the rightful heir to the Portuguese throne. However, he was not Denis&#x27; favourite son, even nearly beginning conflict against him. Instead, the old king preferred his illegitimate son, Afonso Sanches. The notorious rivalry between the half-brothers led to civil war several times. On 7 January 1325, Afonso IV&#x27;s father died and he became king, whereupon he exiled his rival, Afonso Sanches, to Castile, and stripped him of all the lands and fiefdom given by their father. From Castile, Afonso Sanches orchestrated a series of attempts to usurp the crown. After a few failed attempts at invasion, the brothers signed a peace treaty, arranged by Afonso IV&#x27;s mother, Elizabeth.

In 1309, Afonso married Beatrice of Castile, daughter of King Sancho IV of Castile and Mar√≠a de Molina. The first-born of this union was a daughter, Maria of Portugal.

==King of Portugal and Algarve==
In 1325 Alfonso XI of Castile entered a child-marriage with Constanza Manuel of Castile, the daughter of one of his regents. Two years later, he had the marriage annulled so he could marry Afonso&#x27;s daughter, Maria of Portugal. Maria became Queen of Castile in 1328 upon her marriage to Alfonso XI, who soon became involved publicly with a mistress. Constanza was imprisoned in a castle in Toro while her father, Don Juan Manuel, waged war against Alfonso XI until 1329. Eventually, the two reached a peaceful accord after mediation by Juan del Campo, Bishop of Oviedo; this secured Constanza&#x27;s release from prison.

The public humiliation of his daughter led Afonso IV to have his son and heir, Peter I of Portugal, marry the no less aggrieved Castilian &quot;infanta&quot;, Constanza. Afonso subsequently started a war against Castile, peace arriving four years later, through the intervention of the &quot;infanta&quot; Maria herself. A year after the peace treaty was signed in Seville, Portuguese troops played an important role in defeating the Moors at the Battle of R√≠o Salado in October 1340.

== Later life ==
Political intrigue marked the last part of Afonso IV&#x27;s reign, although Castille was torn by civil war after Alfonso XI died. Henry of Trast√°mara challenged the new King Peter of Castile, who sent many Castilian nobles into exile in Portugal. Afonso&#x27;s son Peter fell in love with his new wife&#x27;s lady-in-waiting, In√™s de Castro. In√™s was the daughter of an important noble family from Galicia, with links (albeit illegitimate) to both the royal houses of Castile and Portugal. Her brothers were aligned with the Trastamara faction, and became favorites of Peter, much to the dismay of others at the Portuguese court, who considered them Castilian upstarts. When Constanza died weeks after giving birth to their third child, Peter began living openly with In√™s, recognized all her children as his and refused to marry anyone other than In√™s herself. His father refused to go to war again against Castile, hoping the heir apparent&#x27;s infatuation would end, and tried to arrange another dynastic marriage for him.

The situation became worse as the years passed and the aging Afonso lost control over his court. His grandson and Peter&#x27;s only legitimate son, Ferdinand I of Portugal, was a sickly child, while In√™s&#x27; illegitimate children thrived. Worried about his legitimate grandson&#x27;s life, and the growing power of Castile within Portugal&#x27;s borders, Afonso ordered In√™s de Castro first imprisoned in his mother&#x27;s old convent in Coimbra, and then murdered in 1355. He expected his son to give in and marry a princess, but Peter became enraged upon learning of his wife&#x27;s decapitation in front of their young children. Peter put himself at the head of an army and devastated the country between the Douro and the Minho rivers before he was reconciled to his father in early 1357. Afonso died almost immediately after, in Lisbon in May.

Afonso IV&#x27;s nickname &quot;the Brave&quot; alludes to his martial exploits. However, his most important accomplishments were the relative peace enjoyed by the country during his long reign and the support he gave to the Portuguese Navy. Afonso granted public funding to raise a proper commercial fleet and ordered the first Portuguese maritime explorations. The conflict with Pedro, and the explorations he initiated, eventually became the foundation of the Portuguese national epic, &quot;Os Lus√≠adas&quot; by Lu√≠s de Cam√µes.

The dramatic circumstances of the relationship between father, son and In√™s was used as the basis for the plot of more than twenty operas and ballets. The story with its tragic d√©nouement is immortalized in several plays and poems in Portuguese, such as &quot;Os Lus√≠adas&quot; by Lu√≠s de Cam√µes (canto iii, stanzas 118‚Äì135), and in Spanish, including &quot;Nise lastimosa&quot; and &quot;Nise laureada&quot; (1577) by Jer√≥nimo Berm√∫dez, &quot;Reinar despues de morir&quot; by Luis V√©lez de Guevara, as well as a play by French playwright Henry de Montherlant called &quot;La Reine morte&quot; (&quot;The Dead Queen&quot;). Mary Russell Mitford also wrote a drama based on the story entitled &quot;Inez de Castro&quot;. &quot;In√™s de Castro&quot; is a novel by Maria Pilar Queralt del Hierro in Spanish and Portuguese.

==Marriage and descendants==
On 12 September 1309, Afonso married Beatrice of Castile, daughter of Sancho IV of Castile, and Mar√≠a de Molina, and had four sons and three daughters. Afonso broke the tradition of previous kings and did not have any children out of wedlock.

* Maria of Portugal, Queen of Castile (131318 January 1357), was the wife of Alfonso XI of Castile, and mother of the future King Peter of Castile. Due to the affair of her husband with his mistress Eleanor de Guzm√°n &quot;it was an unfortunate union from the start, contributing to dampening the relations of both kingdoms&quot;; 
* Afonso (1315‚Äì1317), died in his infancy. Buried at the disappeared Convento das Donas of the Dominican Order in Santar√©m; 
* Denis (born 12 February 1317), died a few months after his birth, and was buried in Alcoba√ßa Monastery; 
* Peter I of Portugal (8 April 132018 January 1367), the first surviving male offspring, he succeeded his father. When his wife Constanza died in 1345, Beatrice took care of the education of the two orphans, the &quot;infantes&quot; Maria and Ferdinand, who later reigned as King Ferdinand I of Portugal;
* Isabel (21 December 132411 July 1326), buried at the Monastery of Santa Clara-a-Velha in Coimbra; 
* John (23 September 132621 June 1327), buried at the Monastery of S√£o Dinis de Odivelas;
* Eleanor of Portugal, Queen of Aragon (1328‚Äì1348), born in the same year as her sister Maria&#x27;s wedding, she married King Peter IV of Aragon in November 1347 and died a year after her marriage, succumbing to the Black Death.

<doc id="1661" wikidata="Q299119" url="?curid=1661" title="Afonso V of Portugal">
<text>Afonso V (; 15 January 1432 ‚Äì 28 August 1481), known by the sobriquet the African (), was King of Portugal from 1438 until his death in 1481, with a brief interruption in 1477. His sobriquet refers to his military conquests in Northern Africa.

==Early life==

Born in Sintra on 15 January 1432, Afonso was the second son of King Edward of Portugal by his wife Eleanor of Aragon. Following the death of his older brother, Infante Jo√£o (1429‚Äì1433), Afonso acceded to the position of heir apparent and was made the first Prince of Portugal by his father, who sought to emulate the English court&#x27;s custom of a dynastic title that distinguished the heir apparent from the other children of the monarch. He was only six years old when he succeeded his father in 1438.

During his minority, Afonso was placed under the regency of his mother, Eleanor, in accordance with the will left by his late father. As both a foreigner and a woman, the queen was not a popular choice for regent. When the met in late 1438, a law was passed requiring a joint regency consisting of Eleanor and Pedro, Duke of Coimbra, the younger brother of the late king. The dual regency was a failure and in 1439, the named Pedro &quot;protector and guardian&quot; of the king and &quot;ruler and defender&quot; of the kingdom. Eleanor attempted to resist, but without support in Portugal she fled to Castile.

Pedro&#x27;s regency was characterized by political unrest and weakened authority caused by strife with Afonso, Count of Barcelos, his half-brother and political enemy. In 1441, Afonso&#x27;s V betrothal to Pedro&#x27;s eldest daughter, Isabella, was arranged. The engagement caused a conflict between Pedro and the Count of Barcelos, who had wished for the monarch to marry his granddaughter.

Afonso reached the age of majority in 1446, but Pedro retained administrative power and the title of regent. Afonso and Isabella were formally married on 6 May 1447, seemingly strengthening Pedro&#x27;s power at court. However, the Count of Barcelos began to wield more influence over the young king and persuaded him to dispense Pedro in July 1448. On 15 September of the same year, Afonso V nullified all the laws and edicts approved under the regency. Tensions escalated and in early 1449 Pedro marched his ducal army towards Lisbon, igniting a brief civil war. Pedro was eventually defeated and killed by Afonso V&#x27;s royal forces in the Battle of Alfarrobeira in May 1449.

==Rule==
===Administration===
Afonso financially supported the exploration of the Atlantic Ocean led by his uncle Prince Henry the Navigator. In February 1449, he granted Henry monopoly over navigation in the African Atlantic between Capes Cantin and Bojador. The grant caused conflict with John II of Castile, who asserted that conquest of Barbary and Guinea were reserved for the Castilian crown. John II was also angered by Henry&#x27;s conduct in the Canary Islands and repeatedly wrote to Afonso complaining about displays of hostility, such as attacks on Castilian shipping. Tensions finally deescalated with the marriage of Afonso&#x27;s youngest sister, Joan, to John II&#x27;s heir, Henry, in 1455.

In 1452, Pope Nicholas V issued the papal bull , which granted Afonso V the right to reduce &quot;Saracens, pagans and any other unbelievers&quot; to hereditary slavery. This was reaffirmed and extended in the bull of 1455 (also by Nicholas V). These papal bulls came to be seen by some as a justification for the subsequent era of slave trade and European colonialism.

After Henry&#x27;s death in 1460, his nephew Ferdinand inherited his titles and rights but the monopoly over trade reverted to the crown. In 1469, Afonso V granted Fern√£o Gomes the monopoly of trade in the Gulf of Guinea.

===Invasion of Morocco===

Afonso V&#x27;s interest in Africa was sparked by a desire to support Papal efforts against Islam, especially after the fall of Constantinople in 1453. A large crusade was desired but the Papacy struggled to rally the necessary forces and Afonso, having already made war preparations in Portugal, saw an opportunity to pursue military campaigns in Africa.

In 1458, Afonso V, leading an expeditionary force of 25,000 men, assaulted and captured the town of Alc√°cer Ceguer. After the conquest, he gave himself the title &quot;king of Portugal and the Algarves&quot;, where the plural form of Algarve was meant to refer to both the original Kingdom of the Algarve in southern Portuguese as well as the new territories in Africa. For the next two decades, the Portuguese nobility and crown concentrated their efforts primarily on Morocco. Between November 1463 and April 1464, Afonso made multiple unsuccessful attempts to sieze Tangiers. In August 1471, he launched another campaign with the intention of capturing the city, but his fleet was diverted by a storm to the port of Arzila. After a fierce battle, Arzila was captured. Subsequently, the nearby population of Tangiers fled and the city fell into Portuguese control. His victories earned the king the nickname of &quot;the African&quot; or .

===War with Castile===
Following his campaigns in Africa, Afonso V found new grounds for battle in neighboring Castile. On 11 December 1474 King Henry IV of Castile died without a male heir, leaving just one daughter, Joanna. However, her paternity was questioned; it was rumored that his wife, Queen Joan of Portugal (Afonso&#x27;s sister) had an affair with a nobleman named Beltr√°n de La Cueva. The death of Henry ignited a war of succession, with one faction supporting Joanna and the other supporting Isabella, Henry&#x27;s half-sister. Afonso V was persuaded to intervene on behalf of Joanna, his niece.

On 12 May 1475 Afonso entered Castile with an army of 5,600 cavalry and 14,000 foot soldiers. He met Joanna in Palencia and the two were betrothed and proclaimed sovereigns of Castile on 25 May. The formal marriage was delayed because their close blood-relationship necessitated a papal dispensation.

In March 1476, after several skirmishes and much maneuvering, the 8,000 men of Afonso and Prince John, faced a Castilian force of similar size in the Battle of Toro. The Castilians were led by Isabella&#x27;s husband, Prince Ferdinand II of Aragon, Cardinal Mendoza and the Duke of Alba. The fight was fierce and confusing but the result was a stalemate: while the forces of Cardinal Mendoza and the Duke of Alba won over their opponents led by the Portuguese king‚Äîwho left the battlefield to take refuge in Castronu√±o‚Äîthe troops commanded by Prince John defeated and persecuted the troops of the Castilian right wing and recovered the Portuguese royal standard, remaining ordered in the battlefield where they collected the fugitives of Afonso. Both sides claimed victory, but Afonso&#x27;s prospects for obtaining the Castilian crown were severely damaged.

After the battle, Afonso sailed to France hoping to obtain the assistance of King Louis XI in his fight against Castile. In September 1477, disheartened that his efforts to secure support had proved fruitless, Afonso abdicated the throne and embarked on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. He was eventually persuaded to return to Portugal, where he arrived in November 1477. Prince John had been proclaimed king days prior to Afonso&#x27;s arrival, but relinquished his new title and insisted that his father reassume the crown.

From 1477 to 1481, Afonso V and Prince John were &quot;practically corulers.&quot; Afonso made preparations for a second invasion of Castile in winter 1478, but was deterred by Castilian Hermandad forces. The Treaty of Alc√°√ßovas was finally negotiated in 1479, wherein Afonso renounced his claim to the Castilian throne in exchange for Portuguese hegemony in the Atlantic south of the Canary Islands. Although the treaty was advantageous for Portugal, the king was deeply unhappy with the provision that forced his bride and niece, Joanna, into a convent. Withdrawn and melancholic, he announced his intention to abdicate for a second time and retired to a monastery in Sintra. He died of fever shortly after, on 28 August 1481.

==Marriages and descendants==
Afonso married, firstly, in 1447, his first cousin Isabella of Coimbra, with whom he had three children:

*John, Prince of Portugal (29 January 1451)
*Joan, Princess of Portugal (6 February 1452 ‚Äì 12 May 1490) ‚Äì known as Saint Joan of Portugal, or Saint Joan Princes 
*John II of Portugal (3 March 1455 ‚Äì 25 October 1495) ‚Äì succeeded his father as 13th King of Portugal
After the death of his wife in 1455, he had at least one child out of wedlock with Maria Soares da Cunha, daughter of Afonso&#x27;s major valet, Fernao de Sa Alcoforado:
*√Ålvaro Soares da Cunha (1466‚Äì1557), Noble of the Royal House, Lord of the House of Quintas in Sao Vicente de Pinheiro, Porto and Chief Guard of Pestilence in Porto

<doc id="1662" wikidata="Q691168" url="?curid=1662" title="Afonso VI of Portugal">
<text>&quot;Dom&quot; Afonso VI (; 21 August 164312 September 1683), known as &quot;the Victorious&quot; (), was the second king of Portugal of the House of Braganza from 1656 until his death. He was initially under the regency of his mother, Luisa de Guzm√°n, until 1662, when he removed her to a convent and took power with the help of his favourite, D. Lu√≠s de Vasconcelos e Sousa, 3rd Count of Castelo Melhor.

Afonso&#x27;s reign saw the end of the Restoration War (1640‚Äì68) and Spain&#x27;s recognition of Portugal&#x27;s independence. He also negotiated a French alliance through his marriage. In 1668, his brother Pedro II conspired to have him declared incapable of ruling, and took supreme &quot;de facto&quot; power as regent, although nominally Afonso was still sovereign. Queen Maria Francisca, Afonso&#x27;s wife, received an annulment and subsequently married Pedro. Afonso spent the rest of his life and reign practically a prisoner.

== Early life ==
Afonso was the second of three sons born to King John IV and Queen Luisa. At the age of three, he experienced an illness that resulted in paralysis on the right side of his body. The condition was believed to have also affected his intellectual abilities. His father created him 10th Duke of Braganza.

After the death of his eldest brother Teod√≥sio, Prince of Brazil in 1653, Afonso became the heir apparent to the throne of the kingdom. He also received the crown-princely title 2nd Prince of Brazil.

== Reign ==

He succeeded his father, John IV, in 1656 at the age of thirteen. His mother, Luisa de Guzm√°n, was named regent in his father&#x27;s will.

Luisa&#x27;s regency continued even after Afonso came of age because he was considered mentally unfit for governing. In addition to lacking intellect, the king exhibited wild and disruptive behavior. In 1662, after Afonso terrorized Lisbon at night alongside his favorites, Luisa and her council responded by banishing some of the king&#x27;s companions that were associated with the raids. Angered, Afonso took power with the help of Castelo Melhor and Luisa&#x27;s regency came to an end. She subsequently retired to a convent, where she died in 1666.

Afonso appointed Castelo Melhor as his private secretary (&quot;escriv√£o da puridade&quot;). He proved to be a competent minister. His astute military organization and sensible general appointments resulted in decisive military victories over the Spanish at Elvas (14 January 1659), Ameixial (8 June 1663) and Montes Claros (17 June 1665), culminating in the final Spanish recognition of sovereignty of Portugal&#x27;s new ruling dynasty, the House of Braganza, on 13 February 1668 in the Treaty of Lisbon.

=== Colonial affairs ===
Colonial affairs saw the Dutch conquest of Jaffna, Portugal&#x27;s last colony in Portuguese Ceylon (1658), and the cession of Bombay and Tangier to England (23 June 1661) as dowry for Afonso&#x27;s sister, Infanta Catherine of Braganza, who had married King Charles II of England.

=== Marriage ===
Melhor successfully arranged for Afonso to marry Maria Francisca of Savoy, a relative of the Duke of Savoy, in 1666, but the marriage was short-lived. Maria Francisca filed for an annulment in 1667 based on the impotence of the king. The church granted her the annulment, and she married Afonso&#x27;s brother, Peter II, Duke of Beja.

== Downfall ==

Also in 1667, Pedro managed to gain enough support to force Afonso to relinquish control of the government to him, and he became prince regent in 1668. While Pedro never formally usurped the throne, Afonso was king in name only for the rest of his life. For seven years after Peter&#x27;s coup, Afonso was kept on the island of Terceira in the Azores. His health broken by this captivity, he was eventually permitted to return to the Portuguese mainland, but he remained powerless and kept under guard. At Sintra he died in 1683.

The room where he was imprisoned is preserved at Sintra National Palace.

<doc id="1664" wikidata="Q360388" url="?curid=1664" title="Alfonso II of Asturias">
<text>Alfonso II of Asturias (842), nicknamed the Chaste (), was the king of Asturias during two different periods: first in the year 783 and later from 791 until his death in 842. Upon his death, Nepotian, a family member of undetermined relation, attempted to usurp the crown in place of the future Ramiro I.

During his reign, which covered a span of 51 years, Alfonso discovered the supposed tomb of St. James the Great (called in Spanish) in the town of Compostela, which later became known as the city of Santiago de Compostela. He was the son of Fruela I and Munia, a Basque woman captured and brought back to Asturias by the former following a military campaign.

== Early life ==
He was born in Oviedo in 759 or 760. He was put under the guardianship of his aunt Adosinda after his father&#x27;s death, but one tradition relates his being put in the Monastery of San Xuli√°n de Samos. He was the governor of the palace during the reign of Adosinda&#x27;s husband Silo. On Silo&#x27;s death, he was elected king by Adosinda&#x27;s allies, but the magnates raised his uncle Mauregatus to the throne instead. Alfonso fled to √Ålava where he found shelter with his maternal relatives. Mauregatus was succeeded by Bermudo I, Alfonso&#x27;s cousin, who abdicated after his defeat at the Battle of the Burbia River.

== Alfonso proclaimed king ==
Alfonso was subsequently elected king on 14 September 791. Poets of a later generation invented the story of the secret marriage between his sister Ximena and Sancho, count of Saldana, and the feats of their son Bernardo del Carpio. Bernardo is the hero of a &quot;&quot; written to please the anarchical spirit of the nobles.

Alfonso moved the capital from Pravia, where Silo had located it, to Oviedo, the city of his father&#x27;s founding and his birth. There he constructed churches and a palace. He built the churches of San Tirso, where he is buried, and of San Juli√°n de los Prados (aka Santullano), high above overlooking the nascent city.

== Andalusian raids into Asturias ==
On accession to the throne, Hisham I, son of Abd al-Rahman I, commenced a string of military campaigns in the eastern Pyrenees and to the north-west. In 794, a raid spearheaded by Abd al-Karim dealt a major military blow to Alfonso II on the eastern fringes of the Kingdom of Asturias (Cantabria and Castile). The Asturian king asked for the assistance of the Basque Frankish vassal Belasco, master of √Ålava and bordering regions at the time. Abd al-Karim advanced deeper west into Asturias and pillaged the region, while his brother Abd al-Malik ventured into the western Asturian lands.

== Relations with Charlemagne and the Papacy ==
Under pressure from his enemies, Alfonso II reached out to Charlemagne, sending delegations to Toulouse and Aix-la-Chapelle in 796, 797, and 798. These diplomatic efforts, proffered by Froia and later Basiliscus, may have aimed to strengthen his legitimacy and the Asturian government against ongoing internal unrest‚Äî‚Äî&quot;viz.&quot;, troubles in Galicia‚Äî‚Äîand external attacks of the Ibn Mugait brothers, the generals Abd al-Karim and Abd al-Malik.

Alfonso was acknowledged as a king by Charlemagne and the Pope, and Asturias as a kingdom for the first time in the Royal Frankish Annals. The king showed an interest in the Frankish cult of Saint Martin of Tours, and he encouraged Carolingian Church influence in Asturias.

Alfonso&#x27;s envoys to Charlemagne&#x27;s courts may have also dealt with the adoptionist controversy, which had brought Bermudo&#x27;s kingdom into Charlemagne&#x27;s view. It seems that Carolingian support did much to spur his raid into Andalusian territory up to Lisbon, which was captured and sacked by his troops in 798.

== Later events ==

Also, during Alfonso&#x27;s reign, the alleged resting place of St. James was revealed. Tradition relates that in 814, the body of Saint James was discovered in Compostela and that Alfonso was the first pilgrim to the shrine at Libred√≥n.

In 825, he defeated Saracen forces at Nar√≥n (near Ferrol) and also in year 825 Anceo (in the hills equidistant from Pontevedra and Vigo), and, thanks to these victories, the &quot;repopulation&quot; of parts of Galicia, Le√≥n, and Castile was started‚Äî with charters confirming the possession of the territories.

The &quot;Cr√≥nica Sebastianense&quot; records his death in 842, saying:

:&quot;tras haber llevado por 52 a√±os casta, sobria, inmaculada, piadosa y gloriosamente el gobierno del reino&quot;

:[after having held for 52 years chastely, soberly, immaculately, piously, and gloriously the government of the realm]

<text>Amarasimha (IAST: , ) was a Sanskrit grammarian and poet from ancient India, of whose personal history hardly anything is known. He is said to have been &quot;one of the nine gems that adorned the throne of Vikramaditya,&quot; and according to the evidence of Xuanzang, this is the Chandragupta Vikramaditya (Chandragupta II) who flourished about CE 375. Other sources describe him as belonging to the period of Vikramaditya of 7th century. Most of Amarasi·πÉha&#x27;s works were lost, with the exception of the celebrated &quot;Amara-Kosha&quot; (IAST: &quot;&quot;) (&quot;Treasury of Amara&quot;). The first reliable mention of the &quot;Amarakosha&quot; is in the Amoghavritti of Shakatayana composed during the reign of Amoghavarsha (814-867 CE)

The &quot;Amarakosha&quot; is a lexicon of Sanskrit words in three books, and hence is sometimes called the &quot;TrikƒÅ·πá·∏çƒ´&quot; or the &quot;Tripartite&quot;. It is also known as &quot;Namalinganushasana&quot;. The &quot;Amarakosha&quot; contains 10,000 words, and is arranged, like other works of its class, in metre, to aid the memory.

The first chapter of the &quot;Kosha&quot; was printed at Rome in Tamil character in 1798. An edition of the entire work, with English notes and an index by Henry Thomas Colebrooke appeared at Serampore in 1808. The Sanskrit text was printed at Calcutta in 1831. A French translation by ALA Loiseleur-Deslongchamps was published at Paris in 1839. B. L. Rice compiled the text in Kannada script with meanings in English and Kannada in 1927.

<doc id="1676" wikidata="Q32347" url="?curid=1676" title="Alfonso XII">
<text>Alfonso XII (Alfonso Francisco de As√≠s Fernando P√≠o Juan Mar√≠a de la Concepci√≥n Gregorio Pelayo de Borb√≥n y Borb√≥n; 28 November 185725 November 1885), also known as El Pacificador (Spanish: the Peacemaker), was King of Spain from 29 December 1874 to his death in 1885.

After the Glorious Revolution of 1868 deposed his mother Isabella II from the throne, Alfonso studied in Austria and France. His mother abdicated in his favour in 1870, and he returned to Spain as king in 1874 following a military coup against the First Spanish Republic. Alfonso died aged 27 in 1885, leaving his pregnant widow, Maria Christina of Austria, as regent of Spain. Their son, Alfonso XIII, became king upon his birth the following year. Maria Christina continued as regent until Alfonso XIII came of age in 1902.

==Paternity, early life, and exile==
Alfonso was born in Madrid as the eldest son of the reigning Queen Isabella II on 28 November 1857. His official father, Isabella&#x27;s husband Francisco de As√≠s, has been generally viewed as effeminate, impotent or homosexual, leading writers to question his biological paternity. There is speculation that Alfonso&#x27;s biological father may have been Enrique Puigmolt√≥ y Mayans, a captain of the guard. Others have assigned the fatherhood to Federico Puig Romero, a colonel who was murdered under unclear circumstances in 1866. The relationship of the queen with Puigmolt√≥ was so much of a public hearsay at the time that Francisco de As√≠s initially refused to attend the baptism ceremony of Alfonso (the heir apparent), though he was eventually forced to do so.

These rumours were used as political propaganda against Alfonso by the Carlists, and he came to be widely nicknamed &quot;Puigmoltejo&quot; in reference to his supposed father. His mother&#x27;s accession had created a second cause of instability, the Carlist Wars, where the supporters of Don Carlos, Count of Molina as King of Spain rose to have him enthroned.

In addition, within the context of the post-Napoleonic restorations and revolutions which engulfed Europe and the Americas, both the Carlistas and the Isabelino conservatives were opposed to the new Napoleonic constitutional system. Much like in Britain, which subtracted itself from the liberal constitutional process, Spanish conservatives wanted to continue with the traditional Organic Laws, such as the Fuero Juzgo, the Nov√≠sima Recopilaci√≥n and the Partidas of Alfonso X. This led to a third cause of instability, the independence of most of the American possessions, recognized between 1823 and 1850.

When Queen Isabella II and her husband were forced to leave Spain by the Revolution of 1868, Alfonso accompanied them to Paris. From there, he was sent to the Theresianum in Vienna to continue his studies. On 25 June 1870, he was recalled to Paris, where his mother abdicated in his favour, in the presence of a number of Spanish nobles who had tied their fortunes to those of the exiled queen. He assumed the name Alfonso XII, for although no king of united Spain had borne the name &quot;Alfonso&quot;, the Spanish monarchy was regarded as continuous with the more ancient monarchy represented by the 11 kings of Asturias, Le√≥n and Castile also named Alfonso.

==The Republic==


After the revolution, the &quot;Cortes&quot; decided to set up a new dynasty on the throne. Prince Amadeo of Savoy, the younger son of King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy and a distant cousin of Alfonso by common descent from Charles III, was recognized as King of Spain in November 1870. During a tumultuous reign, Amadeo was targeted by assassination attempts and struggled with opposition from both Carlists and republicans while his own faction split. After the Carlists revolted and the Third Carlist War broke out, he abdicated and returned to Italy in early 1873.

Following Amadeo&#x27;s abandonment, the First Spanish Republic was established, including the territories of Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Pacific Archipelagos. The first act of President Estanislao Figueras was to extend the abolition of slavery to Puerto Rico; Cuban slaves would have to wait until 1889. The republicans were not in agreement either, and they had to contend with a war in Cuba and Muslim uprisings in Spanish Morocco. In the midst of these crises, the Carlist War continued and the Carlist party made itself strong in areas with claims over their national and institutional specificity such as Catalonia and the Basque Country. This unrest led to the creation of a group in favour of the Bourbon Restoration, led by the moderate conservative Antonio C√°novas del Castillo. 

Alfonso was well-educated and cultured, especially compared to his mother. His tutors took great care to have him educated in good schools and to familiarize him with different cultures, languages and government models throughout Europe. During the Franco-Prussian War, Alfonso relocated from Paris to Geneva with his family, and then continued his studies at the Theresianum in Vienna in 1872. C√°novas began to take responsibility for Alfonso&#x27;s education with the goal of shaping him into the ideal king for the planned Bourbon Restoration, and next sent him to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, in England. The training he received there was severe but more cosmopolitan than it would have been in Spain, given its atmosphere at the time.

On 1 December 1874, Alfonso issued the Sandhurst Manifesto, where he set the ideological basis of the Bourbon Restoration. It was drafted in reply to a birthday greeting from his followers, a manifesto proclaiming himself the sole representative of the Spanish monarchy. At the end of 1874, Brigadier Mart√≠nez Campos, who had long been working more or less openly for the king, led some battalions of the central army to Sagunto, rallied the troops sent against him to his own flag, and entered Valencia in the king&#x27;s name. Thereupon the President resigned, and his power was transferred to the king&#x27;s plenipotentiary and adviser, C√°novas. With C√°novas disapproval (he detested the intervention of the military in politics), the 29 December 1875 pronunciamento of Gen. Mart√≠nez Campos in Sagunto ended the failed republic and meant the rise of the young Prince Alfonso.

==Reign==

Within a few days after C√°novas del Castillo took power as Premier, the new king, proclaimed on 29 December 1874, arrived at Madrid, passing through Barcelona and Valencia and was acclaimed everywhere (1875). In 1876, a vigorous campaign against the Carlists, in which the young king took part, resulted in the defeat of Don Carlos and the Duke&#x27;s abandonment of the struggle.

Initially led by C√°novas del Castillo as moderate prime minister, what was thought at one time as a coup aimed at placing the military in the political-administrative positions of power, in reality ushered in a civilian regime that lasted until Primo de Rivera&#x27;s 1923 coup d&#x27;√©tat. C√°novas was the real architect of the new regime of the Restoration.

In 1881 Alfonso refused to sanction a law by which the ministers were to remain in office for a fixed term of 18 months. Upon the consequent resignation of C√°novas del Castillo, he summoned Pr√°xedes Mateo Sagasta, the Liberal leader, to form a new cabinet.

In order to eliminate one of the problems of the reign of Isabel II, the single party and its destabilizing consequences, the Liberal Party was allowed to incorporate and participate in national politics, and the &#x27;turnismo&#x27; or alternation was to become the new system. Turnismo would be endorsed in the Constitution of 1876 and the Pact of El Pardo (1885). It meant that liberal and conservative prime ministers would succeed each other ending thus the troubles.

This led to the end of the Carlist revolts and the victory over the New York-backed Cuban revolutionaries, and led to a huge backing both by insular and peninsular Spaniards of Alfonso.

Alfonso&#x27;s short reign established the foundations for the final socioeconomic recuperation of Spain, bringing an end to the political instability that had dominated Spain for the past two-thirds of a century (see History of Spain (1808‚Äì1874)). Both Europe (the coastal regions, such as the Basque Country, Catalonia, and Asturias) and the colonies in the Antilles and Pacific were able to grow steadily. Cuba and Puerto Rico prospered to the point that Spain&#x27;s first train was not in Spain proper but between Havana and G√ºines in Cuba, and the first telegraph in Latin America was in Puerto Rico, established by Samuel Morse, whose daughter and son-in-law lived there. Upon the American invasion of Puerto Rico, ten US dollars were needed to buy one Puerto Rican peso.

==Marriages==
On 23 January 1878 at the Basilica of Atocha in Madrid, Alfonso married his first cousin, Princess Mar√≠a de las Mercedes, but she died within five months of the marriage.
On 29 November 1879 at the Basilica of Atocha in Madrid, Alfonso married his double third cousin, Archduchess Maria Christina of Austria. During the honeymoon, a pastry cook named Otero fired at the young sovereign and his wife as they were driving in Madrid.

The children of this marriage were:
* Mar√≠a de las Mercedes, Princess of Asturias, (11 September 188017 October 1904), married on 14 February 1901 to Prince Carlos of Bourbon-Two Sicilies. She was titular heir to the throne of Spain from the death of her father until the posthumous birth of her brother.
* Mar√≠a Teresa, (12 November 188223 September 1912), married to Prince Ferdinand of Bavaria on 12 January 1906
* Alfonso XIII (17 May 188628 February 1941). Born posthumously. He married Princess Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg

Alfonso had two sons by Elena Armanda Nicolasa Sanz y Mart√≠nez de Arizala (15 December 1849, in Castell√≥n de la Plana ‚Äì 24 December 1898, in Paris):
* Alfonso Sanz y Mart√≠nez de Arizala (28 January 1880, in Madrid19 March 1970, in Paris), married in 1922 to Mar√≠a de Guadalupe de Limantour y Mariscal
* Fernando Sanz y Mart√≠nez de Arizala (28 February 1881, in Madrid8 January 1925, in Pau, France), unmarried and without issue

==Death and impact==

In November 1885, Alfonso died aged 27 at the Royal Palace of El Pardo near Madrid. He had been suffering from tuberculosis, but the immediate cause of his death was a recurrence of dysentery.

In 1902, his widow Maria Cristina initiated a national contest to build a monument in memory of Alfonso. The winning design, by Jos√© Grases Riera, was constructed in an artificial lake in Madrid&#x27;s Parque del Buen Retiro in 1922.

Coming to the throne at such an early age, Alfonso had served no apprenticeship in the art of ruling. Benevolent and sympathetic in disposition, he won the affection of his people by fearlessly visiting districts ravaged by cholera or devastated by the 1884 Andalusian earthquake. His capacity for dealing with men was considerable, and he never allowed himself to become the instrument of any particular party. During his short reign, peace was established both at home and abroad, finances were well regulated, and the various administrative services were placed on a basis that afterwards enabled Spain to pass through the disastrous war with the United States without the threat of a revolution.

<text>Alfonso XIII (Spanish: &quot;Alfonso Le√≥n Fernando Mar√≠a Jaime Isidro Pascual Antonio de Borb√≥n y Habsburgo-Lorena&quot;; French: &quot;Alphonse L√©on Ferdinand Marie Jacques Isidore Pascal Antoine de Bourbon&quot;; 17 May 1886 ‚Äì 28 February 1941), also known as El Africano or the African for his Africanist views, was King of Spain from his birth until 14 April 1931, when the Second Spanish Republic was proclaimed. He became a monarch at birth as his father, Alfonso XII, had died the previous year. Alfonso&#x27;s mother, Maria Christina of Austria, served as regent until he assumed full powers on his sixteenth birthday in 1902.

Alfonso XIII&#x27;s upbringing and public image were closely linked to the military estate; he often presented himself as a soldier-king. His effective reign started four years after the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, when various social milieus projected their expectations of national regeneration onto him. Like other European monarchs of his time he played a political role, entailing a controversial use of his constitutional executive powers. His wedding to Princess Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg in 1906 was marred by an attempt at regicide; he was unharmed.

With public opinion divided over World War I, and moreover a split between pro-German and pro-Entente sympathizers, Alfonso XIII used his relations with other European royal families to help preserve a stance of neutrality, as espoused by his government; however, several factors weakened the monarch&#x27;s constitutional legitimacy: the rupture of the system, the deepening of the Restoration system crisis in the 1910s, a trio of crises in 1917, the spiral of violence in Morocco, and especially the lead-up to the 1923 installment of the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera, an event that succeeded by means of both military coup d&#x27;√©tat and the king&#x27;s acquiescence. Over the course of his reign, the monarch ended up favouring an authoritarian solution rather than constitutional liberalism.

Upon the political failure of the dictatorship, Alfonso XIII removed support from Primo de Rivera (who was thereby forced to resign in 1930) and favoured (during the &quot;dictablanda&quot;) an attempted return to the pre-1923 state of affairs. Nevertheless, he had lost most of his political capital along the way. He left Spain voluntarily after the municipal elections of April 1931 ‚Äì which was understood as a plebiscite on maintaining the monarchy or declaring a republic ‚Äì the result of which led to the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic on 14 April 1931. For his efforts with the European War Office during World War I, he earned a nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1917, which was ultimately won by the Red Cross. To date, he remains the only monarch known to have been nominated for a Nobel Prize.

==Reign==
===Early life and education===

Alfonso XIII was born at the Royal Palace of Madrid on 17 May 1886. He was the posthumous son of Alfonso XII of Spain, who had died in November 1885, and became king upon his birth. Just after he was born, he was carried naked to the prime minister Pr√°xedes Mateo Sagasta on a silver tray.

Five days later, he was carried in a solemn court procession with a Golden Fleece around his neck and was baptised with water specially brought from the River Jordan in Palestine. The French newspaper described the young king in 1889 as &quot;the happiest and best-loved of all the rulers of the earth&quot;. His mother, Maria Christina of Austria, served as his regent until his sixteenth birthday. During the regency, in 1898, Spain lost its colonial rule over Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippines to the United States as a result of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War.

Alfonso became seriously ill during the 1889‚Äì1890 pandemic. His health deteriorated around 10 January 1890, and doctors reported his condition as the flu attacked his nervous system leaving the young king in a state of indolence. He eventually recovered.

When Alfonso came of age in May 1902, the week of his majority was marked by festivities, bullfights, balls and receptions throughout Spain. He took his oath to the constitution before members of the Cortes on 17 May.

Alfonso received, to a large extent, a military education that imbued him with &quot;a Spanish nationalism strengthened by his military vocation&quot;. Besides the clique of military tutors, Alfonso also received political teachings from a liberal, , and moral precepts from an integrist, Jos√© Fern√°ndez de la Monta√±a.

===Engagement and marriage===

By 1905, Alfonso was looking for a suitable consort. On a state visit to the United Kingdom, he stayed in London at Buckingham Palace with King Edward VII. There he met Princess Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg, the daughter of Edward&#x27;s youngest sister Princess Beatrice, and a granddaughter of Queen Victoria. He found her attractive, and she returned his interest. There were obstacles to the marriage. Victoria was a Protestant, and would have to become a Catholic. Victoria&#x27;s brother, Leopold, was a haemophiliac, so there was a 50 percent chance that Victoria was a carrier of the trait. Finally, Alfonso&#x27;s mother Maria Christina wanted him to marry a member of her family, the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, or some other Catholic princess, as she considered the Battenbergs to be non-dynastic.

Victoria was willing to change her religion, and her being a haemophilia carrier was only a possibility. Maria Christina was eventually persuaded to drop her opposition. In January 1906 she wrote an official letter to Princess Beatrice proposing the match. Victoria met Maria Christina and Alfonso in Biarritz, France, later that month, and converted to Catholicism in San Sebasti√°n in March.
In May, diplomats of both kingdoms officially executed the agreement of marriage. Alfonso and Victoria were married at the Royal Monastery of San Jer√≥nimo in Madrid on 31 May 1906, with British royalty in attendance, including Victoria&#x27;s cousins the Prince and Princess of Wales (later King George V and Queen Mary). The wedding was marked by an assassination attempt on Alfonso and Victoria by Catalan anarchist Mateu Morral. As the wedding procession returned to the palace, he threw a bomb from a window which killed 30 bystanders and members of the procession, while 100 others were wounded.

On 10 May 1907, the couple&#x27;s first child, Alfonso, Prince of Asturias, was born. Victoria was in fact a haemophilia carrier, and Alfonso inherited the condition.

Neither of the two daughters born to the King and Queen were haemophilia carriers, but another of their sons, Gonzalo (1914‚Äì1934), had the condition. Alfonso distanced himself from his wife for transmitting the condition to their sons. From 1914 on, he had several mistresses, and fathered five illegitimate children. A sixth illegitimate child had been born before his marriage.

===World War I===
During World War I, because of his family connections with both sides and the division of popular opinion, Spain remained neutral. The King established an office for assistance to prisoners of war on all sides. This office used the Spanish diplomatic and military network abroad to intercede for thousands of POWs ‚Äì transmitting and receiving letters for them, and other services. The office was located in the Royal Palace.

Alfonso attempted to save the Russian Tsar Nicholas II and his family from the Bolsheviks who captured them, sending two telegrams offering the Russian imperial family refuge in Spain. He later learned of the execution of the Romanov family, but was mistaken in believing that only Nicholas II and his son Alexei had been killed. As such, he continued to push for the Tsarina Alexandra, a first cousin of Victoria Eugenie, and her four daughters to be brought to Spain, not having realized that they had also been murdered.

Alfonso became gravely ill during the 1918 flu pandemic. Spain was neutral and thus under no wartime censorship restrictions, so his illness and subsequent recovery were reported to the world, while flu outbreaks in the belligerent countries were concealed. This gave the misleading impression that Spain was the most affected area and led to the pandemic being dubbed &quot;the Spanish Flu&quot;.

===Cracking of the system and dictatorship===
Following World War I, Spain entered the lengthy yet victorious Rif War (1920‚Äì1926) to preserve its colonial rule over northern Morocco. Critics of the monarchy thought the war was an unforgivable loss of money and lives, and nicknamed Alfonso &quot;el Africano&quot; (&quot;the African&quot;). Alfonso had not acted as a strict constitutional monarch, and supported the Africanists who wanted to conquer for Spain a new empire in Africa to compensate for the lost empire in the Americas and elsewhere. The Rif War had starkly polarized Spanish society between the Africanists who wanted to conquer an empire in Africa vs. the &quot;abandonistas&quot; who wanted to abandon Morocco as not worth the blood and treasure. Alfonso liked to play favourites with his generals, and one of his most favoured generals was Manuel Fern√°ndez Silvestre. In 1921, when Silvestre advanced up into the Rif mountains of Morocco, Alfonso sent him a telegram whose first line read &quot;Hurrah for real men!&quot;, urging Silvestre not to retreat at a time when Silvestre was experiencing major difficulties. Silvestre stayed the course, leading his men into the Battle of Annual, one of Spain&#x27;s worst defeats. Alfonso, who was on holiday in the south of France at the time, was informed of the &quot;Disaster of the Annual&quot; while he was playing golf. Reportedly, Alfonso&#x27;s response to the news was to shrug his shoulders and say &quot;Chicken meat is cheap&quot;, before resuming his game. Alfonso remained in France and did not return to Spain to comfort the families of the soldiers lost in the battle, which many people at the time saw as a callous and cold act, a sign that the King was indifferent over the lives of his soldiers. In 1922, the Cortes started an investigation into the responsibility for the Annual disaster and soon discovered evidence that the King had been one of the main supporters of Silvestre&#x27;s advance into the Rif mountains.

After the &quot;Disaster of the Annual&quot;, Spain&#x27;s war in the Rif went from bad to worse, and as the Spanish were barely hanging on to Morocco, support for the &quot;abandonistas&quot; grew as many people could see no point to the war. In August 1923, Spanish soldiers embarking for Morocco mutinied, other soldiers in M√°laga simply refused to board the ships that were to take them to Morocco, while in Barcelona huge crowds of left-wingers had staged anti-war protests at which Spanish flags were burned while the flag of the Rif Republic was waved about. With the Africanists comprising only a minority, it was clear that it was only a matter of time before the &quot;abandonistas&quot; forced the Spanish to give up on the Rif, which was part of the reason for the military coup d&#x27;√©tat later in 1923.

On 13 September 1923, Miguel Primo de Rivera, Captain General of Catalonia, staged a military coup with the collaboration from a quad of &quot;Africanist&quot; generals based in Madrid (Jos√© Cavalcanti, Federico Berenguer, Leopoldo Saro and Antonio Dab√°n). These generals were associated with the innermost military clique of Alfonso XIII and wanted to prevent investigations about Annual from tarnishing the monarch, even if Primo de Rivera had embraced &quot;Abandonista&quot; positions prior to that point. Primo de Rivera ruled as a dictator with the king&#x27;s support until January 1930.

During the dictatorship, the king increased his public presence, siding with a Catholic, anti-Catalanist, dictatorial and militarist brand of Spanish nationalism.
On 28 January 1930, amid economic problems, general unpopularity and a putschist plot led by General Manuel Goded in motion, of which Alfonso XIII was most probably aware, Miguel Primo de Rivera was forced to resign, exiling to Paris, only to die a few weeks later of the complications from diabetes in combination with the effects of a flu. Alfonso XIII appointed General D√°maso Berenguer as the new prime minister. Back in 1926, Alfonso XIII had appointed Berenguer as Chief of Staff of the Military House of the King, a post conventionally fit for burned-out generals in order to move them away from the spotlight for a time in a show of affection. The new period was nicknamed as &quot;dictablanda&quot;. The King was so closely associated with the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera that it was difficult for him to distance himself from the regime that he had supported for almost seven years. The enforced changes relied on the incorrect assumption that Spaniards would accept the notion that nothing had happened after 1923 and that going back to the prior state of things was possible.

==Dethronement and politics in exile==
On 12 April, the Republican coalition, short of winning a majority of councillors overall, won a sweeping majority in major cities in the 1931 municipal elections, which were perceived as a plebiscite on monarchy. The results shocked the government, with foreign minister Romanones admitting to the press an &quot;absolute monarchist defeat&quot; and Civil Guard honcho Jos√© Sanjurjo reportedly telling government ministers that, given circumstances, the Armed Forces could not be &quot;absolutely&quot; relied upon for the sustainment of the monarchy. Alfonso XIII fled the country and the Second Spanish Republic was peacefully proclaimed on 14 April 1931.

In November 1931, the Constituent Republican Cortes held an impassionate debate about the political responsibilities of the former monarch. Some of the grievances against the actions of Alfonso XIII as a king included interference in state institutions to reinforce his personal power, bargaining personal support from the military clique with rewards and merits, his abuse of the power to dissolve the legislature, rendering the co-sovereignty between the Nation and the Crown a total fiction; that he had disproportionately fostered the Armed forces (often to contain internal protest), had used the armed forces abroad with imperialist aims alien to the interests of the nation but his own, that he had personally devised the military operation of Annual behind the back of the Council of Ministers, and that following the massacre of Annual that &quot;cost the lives of thousands of Spanish lads&quot;, he had decided to launch a coup with the help of a few generals rather than facing scrutiny in the legislature. Other than Romanones, who exculpated the actions of the monarch, disconformity towards the Primo de Rivera dictatorship notwithstanding, no other legislator intervened in his favour, with the debate focusing on whether to label the monarch&#x27;s actions as a military rebellion, l√®se-majest√©, high treason, or even condemning &quot;a delinquent personality&quot; or &quot;a wholly punishable life&quot;. The debate ended with an eloquent speech by Prime Minister Manuel Aza√±a pleading for the unanimity of the house &quot;to condemn and exclude D. Alfonso de Borb√≥n from the law, proclaiming the majesty of our republic, the unbreakable will of our civism and the permanence of the Spanish glories framed by the institutions freely given by the Nation&quot;. The house passed the act brought forward by the Commission of Responsibilities, summarizing Alfonso de Borb√≥n&#x27;s responsibilities as being guilty of high treason.

Involved in anti-Republican plots from his exile, and keen to draw support from the Carlists in the context of the uneasy and competing relations between the Carlist and Alfonsist factions within the radicalised monarchist camp, in the aftermath of so-called Pact of Territet he issued a statement dated 23 January 1932 endorsing the manifesto launched by Carlist claimant Alfonso Carlos (in which the latter hinted at the cession of dynastic rights should the former king accept &quot;those fundamental principles which in our traditional regime have been demanded of all Kings with precedence of personal rights&quot;), with the dethroned king likewise accusing in the document the reformist Republic to be &quot;inspired and sponsored by communism, freemasonry and judaism&quot;.

In 1933, his two eldest sons, Alfonso and Jaime, renounced their claims to the defunct throne on the same day, and in 1934 his youngest son Gonzalo died. This left his third son Juan his only male heir.

After the July 1936 attempted coup d&#x27;√©tat against the democratically elected Republican government a war broke out in Spain. On 30 July 1936, Alfonso&#x27;s son Juan took the initiative of leaving Cannes to go to Spain to join the rebel faction, with the former king (then in a hunting trip in Czechoslovakia) reportedly giving consent, so Juan de Borb√≥n crossed the border set to join the front in Somosierra dressed in a blue jumpsuit and red beret under the fake name &quot;Juan L√≥pez&quot;. However, rebel general Emilio Mola, mastermind behind the putschist plot, was warned of the move and had Juan returned. The former king made it clear he favoured the rebel faction against the Republican government. In September 1936, the general who had emerged as leader of the rebel faction, Francisco Franco, declared that he would not restore Alfonso as king.

==Death==

On 15 January 1941, Alfonso XIII renounced his rights to the defunct Spanish throne in favour of Juan. He died in Rome on 28 February that year following weeks in agony after a first severe attack of angina pectoris.

In Spain, dictator Francisco Franco ordered three days of national mourning. The ex-king&#x27;s funeral was held in Rome in the Church of Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri. He was buried in the Church of Santa Maria in Monserrato degli Spagnoli, the Spanish national church in Rome, immediately below the tombs of Popes Callixtus III and Alexander VI. In January 1980 his remains were transferred to El Escorial in Spain.

==Legacy==
Alfonso was a promoter of tourism in Spain. The need for the lodging of his wedding guests prompted the construction of the luxurious Hotel Palace in Madrid. He also supported the creation of a network of state-run lodges, Paradores, in historic buildings of Spain. His fondness for the sport of football led to the patronage of several &quot;royal&quot; (&quot;real&quot; in Spanish) football clubs, the first being Real Club Deportivo de La Coru√±a in 1907. Selected others include Real Madrid, Real Sociedad, Real Betis, Real Uni√≥n, Espanyol, Real Zaragoza and Real Racing Club.

An avenue in the northern Madrid neighbourhood of Chamart√≠n, Avenida de Alfonso XIII, is named after him. A plaza or town centre in Iloilo City, Philippines (now Plaza Libertad) was named in his honour called Plaza Alfonso XIII. A street in Merthyr Tydfil, in Wales, was built especially to house Spanish immigrants in the mining industry and named Alphonso Street after Alfonso XIII.

Ratoncito P√©rez first appeared as the Spanish equivalent to the Tooth Fairy in a 1894 tale written by Luis Coloma for King Alfonso XIII, who had just lost a milk tooth at the age of eight, with the King appearing in the tale as &quot;King Buby&quot;. The tale has been adapted into further literary works and movies since then, with the character of King Buby appearing in some. The tradition of Ratoncito P√©rez replacing the lost milk teeth with a small payment or gift while the child sleeps is almost universally followed today in Spain and Hispanic America. Alfonso XIII is also mentioned on the plaque that the City Council of Madrid dedicated in 2003 to Ratoncito P√©rez on the second floor of number eight of , where the mouse was said to have lived.

==Personal life==
===Legitimate and illegitimate children===
Alfonso and his wife Princess Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg (Ena) had seven children:
#Alfonso, Prince of Asturias (10 May 1907 ‚Äì 6 September 1938);
#Infante Jaime, Duke of Segovia (23 May 1908 ‚Äì 20 March 1975);
#Infanta Beatriz (22 June 1909 ‚Äì 22 November 2002);
#Infante Fernando (stillborn 21 May 1910);
#Infanta Mar√≠a Cristina (12 December 1911 ‚Äì 23 December 1996);
#Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona (20 June 1913 ‚Äì 1 April 1993);
#Infante Gonzalo (24 October 1914 ‚Äì 13 August 1934).

Alfonso also had a number of reported illegitimate children that are known, including: 
*Roger Marie Vincent Philippe L√©v√™que de Vilmorin (1905‚Äì1980; by French aristocrat M√©lanie de Gaufridy de Dortan, married to Philippe de Vilmorin); 
*Juana Alfonsa Mil√°n y Qui√±ones de Le√≥n (1916‚Äì2005; by Alfonso&#x27;s &quot;governess&quot; B√©atrice Noon); 
*Anna Mar√≠a Teresa Ruiz y Moragas (1925‚Äì1965; by Spanish actress Carmen Ruiz Moragas) 
* (1929‚Äì2016; by Spanish actress Carmen Ruiz Moragas); 
*Carmen Gravina (1926‚Äì2006; by Carmen de Navascu√©s).

===Attitude towards Jews===
Alfonso was known for his friendly attitude towards Jews and publicly praised them. In 1932, he embraced the Judeo-Masonic-Communist conspiracy theory. He took several actions to offer them protection. In 1917, Alfonso instructed the Spanish consul in Jerusalem, Antonio de la Cierva y Lewita, Count of Ballobar, to help protect Palestinian Jews. On another occasion, after a high official in Tetuan had committed onslaughts against Jews, a delegation composed of Catholics, Jews, and Muslims appealed to Alfonso. The King then removed the Tetuan official from power, in spite of the fact that the official possessed the support of the Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs. According to the Jewish Professor Abraham S.E. Yahuda, Alfonso told Yahuda in private conversations that he would issue no policies of discrimination towards Jews, believing all of his Spanish subjects to be entitled to equal rights and protection.

===Pornographic cinema===
Alfonso is occasionally referred to as &quot;the playboy king&quot;, due in part to his promotion and collection of Spanish pornographic films, as well as his extramarital affairs. As King, Alfonso commissioned pornographic films through the Barcelona production company &quot;Royal Films&quot;, with the Count of Romanones acting as an intermediary figure between him and the company. Between forty and seventy pornographic films are said to have been shot in total (three of which have been preserved) and were screened in Barcelona&#x27;s Chinatown, as well as during Alfonso&#x27;s private screenings. The films, while silent and in black and white, were nonetheless very explicit for the time, showing full nudity and sex scenes. These films featured content considered immoral and degenerate, including sexual relationships involving Catholic priests, lesbianism, and &quot;women with enormous breasts&quot; (the last of which is said to have been Alfonso&#x27;s passion). Most of these films were later destroyed during Franco&#x27;s regime.

This has led some to speculate that Alfonso may have possessed a sex addiction.

==Ancestry==
Alfonso XIII is a rare example of endogamy. In the eleventh generation he is &quot;assumed&quot; to only have 111 ancestors whereas in a standard situation one expects to identify 1024 of them, a situation of implex of 89%. The biological paternity of Alfonso&#x27;s father Alfonso XII on the part of Francisco de As√≠s is however very much in doubt.

Written as it was during Queen Ena&#x27;s lifetime, this book necessarily omits the King&#x27;s extramarital affairs; but it remains a useful biography, not least because the author knew Alfonso quite well, interviewed him at considerable length, and relates him to the wider Spanish intellectual culture of his time.

<text>Alfonso I (7 September 1134), called the Battler or the Warrior (), was King of Aragon and Navarre from 1104 until his death in 1134. He was the second son of King Sancho Ram√≠rez and successor of his brother Peter I. With his marriage to Urraca, queen regnant of Castile, Le√≥n and Galicia, in 1109, he began to use, with some justification, the grandiose title Emperor of Spain, formerly employed by his father-in-law, Alfonso VI. Alfonso the Battler earned his sobriquet in the Reconquista. He won his greatest military successes in the middle Ebro, where he conquered Zaragoza in 1118 and later took Ejea, Tudela, Calatayud, Borja, Tarazona, Daroca, and Monreal del Campo. He died in September 1134 after an unsuccessful battle with the Muslims at the Battle of Fraga.

Alfonso&#x27;s nickname comes from the Aragonese version of the &quot;Chronicle of San Juan de la Pe√±a&quot; (c. 1370), which says that &quot;they called him lord Alfonso the battler because in Spain there wasn&#x27;t as good a knight who won twenty-nine battles&quot; (&quot;clamabanlo don Alfonso batallador porque en Espayna no ovo tan buen cavallero que veynte nueve batallas ven√ßi√≥&quot;).

==Early life==
His earliest years were passed in the monastery of Siresa, learning to read and write and to practice the military arts under the tutelage of Lope Garc√©s the Pilgrim, who was repaid for his services by his former charge with the county of Pedrola when Alfonso came to the throne.

During his brother&#x27;s reign, he participated in the taking of Huesca (the Battle of Alcoraz, 1096), which became the largest city in the kingdom and the new capital. He also joined El Cid&#x27;s expeditions in Valencia. His father gave him the lordships of Biel, Luna, Ardenes, and Bailo.

A series of deaths put Alfonso directly in line for the throne. His brother&#x27;s children, Isabella and Peter (who married Mar√≠a Rodr√≠guez, daughter of El Cid), died in 1103 and 1104 respectively.

==Matrimonial conflicts==
A passionate fighting-man (he fought twenty-nine battles against Christian or Moor), he was married (when well over 30 years and a habitual bachelor) in 1109 to the ambitious Queen Urraca of Le√≥n, a passionate woman unsuited for a subordinate role. The marriage had been arranged by her father Alfonso VI of Le√≥n in 1106 to unite the two chief Christian states against the Almoravids, and to supply them with a capable military leader. But Urraca was tenacious of her right as queen regnant and had not learnt chastity in the polygamous household of her father. Husband and wife quarrelled with the brutality of the age and came to open war, even placing Urraca under siege at Astorga in 1112. Alfonso had the support of one section of the nobles who found their account in the confusion. Being a much better soldier than any of his opponents he won the Battle of Candespina and the Battle of Viadangos, but his only trustworthy supporters were his Aragonese, who were not numerous enough to keep Castile and Le√≥n subjugated. The marriage of Alfonso and Urraca was declared null by the pope, as they were second cousins, in 1110, but he ignored the papal nuncio and clung to his liaison with Urraca until 1114. During his marriage, he had called himself &quot;King and Emperor of Castile, Toledo, Arag√≥n, Pamplona, Sobrarbe, and Ribagorza&quot; in recognition of his rights as Urraca&#x27;s husband; of his inheritance of the lands of his father, including the kingdom of his great-uncle Gonzalo; and his prerogative to conquer Andalusia from the Muslims. He inserted the title of &quot;imperator&quot; on the basis that he had three kingdoms under his rule.

Alfonso&#x27;s late marriage and his failure to remarry and produce the essential legitimate heir that should have been a dynastic linchpin of his aggressive territorial policies have been adduced as a lack of interest in women. Ibn al-Athir (1166‚Äì1234) describes Alfonso as a tireless soldier who would sleep in his armor without benefit of cover, whom when asked why he did not take his pleasure from women, responded that the man devoted to war needs the companionship of men not women.

==Church relations==

The king quarrelled with the church, and particularly the Cistercians, almost as violently as with his wife. As he defeated her, so he drove Archbishop Bernard into exile and replaced the abbot of Sahag√∫n with his brother. He was finally compelled to give way in Castile and Le√≥n to his stepson, Alfonso VII of Castile, son of Urraca and her first husband. The intervention of Pope Calixtus II brought about an arrangement between the old man and his young namesake.

In 1122 in Belchite, he founded a confraternity of knights to fight against the Almoravids. It was the start of the military orders in Aragon. Years later, he organised a branch of the &quot;Militia Christi&quot; of the Holy Land at Monreal del Campo.

==Military expansion==
Alfonso spent his first four years as king in near-constant war with the Muslims. In 1105, he conquered Ejea and Tauste and refortified Castellar and Juslibol. In 1106, he defeated Ahmad II al-Musta&#x27;in of Zaragoza at Valtierra. In 1107, he took Tamarite de Litera and San Esteban de Litera. 
Then followed a period dominated by his relations with Castile and Le√≥n through his wife, Urraca. He resumed his conquests in 1117 with Fitero, Corella, Cintru√©nigo, Murchante, Monteagudo, and Cascante.

In 1118, the Council of Toulouse declared a crusade to assist in the conquest of Zaragoza. Many Frenchmen consequently joined Alfonso at Ayerbe. They took Almud√©var, Gurrea de G√°llego, and Zuera, besieging Zaragoza itself by the end of May. The city fell on 18 December, and the forces of Alfonso occupied the Azuda, the government tower. The great palace of the city was given to the monks of Bernard. Promptly, the city was made Alfonso&#x27;s capital. Two years later, in 1120, he defeated a Muslim army intent on reconquering his new capital at the Battle of Cutanda. He promulgated the &quot;fuero&quot; of &quot;tortum per tortum&quot;, facilitating taking the law into one&#x27;s own hands, which among others reassumed the Muslim right to dwell in the city and their right to keep their properties and practice their religion under their own jurisdiction as long as they maintained tax payment and relocated to the suburbs.

In 1119, he retook Cervera, Tudejen, Castell√≥n, Tarazona, √Ågreda, Magall√≥n, Borja, Alag√≥n, Novillas, Mall√©n, Rueda, √âpila and populated the region of Soria. He began the siege of Calatayud, but left to defeat the army at Cutanda trying to retake Zaragoza. When Calatayud fell, he took Bubierca, Alhama de Arag√≥n, Ariza, and Daroca (1120). In 1123, he besieged Lleida, which was in the hands of the count of Barcelona. From the winter of 1124 to September 1125, he was on a risky expedition to Pe√±a Cadiella deep in Andalusia.

In the great raid of 1125, he carried away a large part of the subject Christians from Granada, and in the south-west of France, he had rights as king of Navarre. From 1125 to 1126, he was on campaign against Granada, where he was trying to install a Christian prince, and C√≥rdoba, where he got only as far as Motril. In 1127, he reconquered Longares, but simultaneously lost all his Castilian possessions to Alfonso VII. He confirmed a treaty with Castile the next year (1128) with the Peace of T√°mara, which fixed the boundaries of the two realms.

He conquered Molina de Arag√≥n and populated Monz√≥n in 1129, before besieging Valencia, which had fallen again upon the Cid&#x27;s death.

He went north of the Pyren√©es in October 1130 to protect the Val d&#x27;Aran. Early in 1131, he besieged Bayonne. It is said he ruled &quot;from Belorado to Pallars and from Bayonne to Monreal.&quot;

At the siege of Bayonne in October 1131, three years before his death, he published a will leaving his kingdom to three autonomous religious orders based in Palestine and politically largely independent ‚Äì the Knights Templars, the Hospitallers, and the Knights of the Holy Sepulchre, whose influences might have been expected to cancel one another out. The will has puzzled some historians, who have read it as an unusual gesture of extreme piety, though not out of line with his purported devotion for militant Christianity. Elena Lourie (1975) suggested instead that it was Alfonso&#x27;s attempt to neutralize the papacy&#x27;s interest in a disputed succession ‚Äì Aragon had been a fief of the papacy since 1068 ‚Äì and to fend off Urraca&#x27;s son from her first marriage, Alfonso VII of Castile, for the papacy would be bound to press the terms of such a pious testament. Generous bequests to important churches and abbeys in Castile had the effect of making the noble churchmen there beneficiaries who would be encouraged by the will to act as a brake on Alfonso VII&#x27;s ambitions to break it ‚Äì and yet among the magnates witnessing the will in 1131 there was not a single cleric. In the event it was a will that his nobles refused to carry out ‚Äì instead bringing his brother Ramiro from the monastery to assume royal powers ‚Äì an eventuality that Lourie suggests was Alfonso&#x27;s hidden intent.

His final campaigns were against Mequinenza (1133) and Fraga (1134), where Garc√≠a Ram√≠rez, the future king of Navarre, and a mere 500 other knights fought with him. It fell on 17 July. He was dead by September. His tomb is in the monastery of San Pedro in Huesca.

==Death==

===Succession===

The testament of Alfonso leaving his kingdom to the three orders was dismissed out of hand by the nobility of his kingdoms, and possible successors were sought. Alfonso&#x27;s only brother, Ramiro, had been a Benedictine monk since childhood, and his commitment to the church, his temperament and vow of celibacy made him ill-suited to rule a kingdom under constant military threat and in need of a stable line of succession. The step-son of the deceased king, Alfonso VII of Le√≥n, as reigning monarch and legitimate descendant of Sancho III of Navarre, put himself forward but garnered no local support. The nobility of Navarre aligned behind Pedro de Atar√©s, the grandson of Alfonso&#x27;s illegitimate uncle, while the Aragonese nobility rallied around the abbot-bishop Ramiro. A convention was called at Borja in order to develop a consensus. Pedro de Atar√©s had so alienated his own partisans there with his perceived arrogance that they had abandoned him, yet at the same time were unwilling to accept Alfonso&#x27;s younger brother Ramiro. The convention then broke up without ever arriving at a compromise, and the two regional factions proceeded to act independently.

The choice of the Navarrese lords fell on Garc√≠a Ram√≠rez, Lord of Monz√≥n, descendant of an illegitimate son of Garc√≠a S√°nchez III and prot√©g√© of Alfonso VII to be their king. The Aragonese took Ramiro out of a monastery and made him king, marrying him without papal dispensation to Agnes, sister of the Duke of Aquitaine, then betrothing their newborn daughter to Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona, who was then named Ramiro&#x27;s heir. &quot;The result of the crisis produced by the result of Alfonso I&#x27;s will was a major reorientation of the peninsula&#x27;s kingdoms: the separation of Aragon and Navarre, the union of Aragon and Catalonia and ‚Äì a moot point but stressed particularly by some Castilian historians ‚Äì the affirmation of &#x27;Castilian hegemony&#x27; in Spain&quot; by the rendering of homage for Zaragoza by Alfonso&#x27;s eventual heir, Ramon Berenguer IV of Barcelona.

===Pseudo-Alfonso the Battler===
Sometime during the reign of Alfonso II of Aragon, the Battler&#x27;s grandnephew, a man came forward claiming to be Alfonso the Battler. The only contemporary references to this event are two letters of Alfonso II addressed to Louis VII of France; they were carried to Louis by Berengar, the Bishop of Lleida, but are not dated. According to the second of these, the pretender was then living in Louis&#x27;s domains, meaning the Principality of Catalonia, which was ruled by Alfonso under Louis&#x27;s suzerainty. This pretender was an old man (appropriately, since the Battler had died some decades earlier) and Alfonso II expressed confidence that Louis would arrest him at the earliest possible moment and bring him to justice. The first letter supplies sufficient information to date it approximately, since the Bishop sojourned at the court of Louis on his way to Rome. It is known from other sources that Berengar attended the Third Lateran Council in March 1179. The letters were probably written towards the end of 1178 or in January 1179 at the latest. According to an annalist source for the years 1089‚Äì1196, the pretender was received with honour and pomp in Zaragoza, Calatayud, and Daroca, which the Battler had conquered, but after it was found out that he was false he was executed before the city of Barcelona in 1181. Modern historian Antonio Ubieto Arteta has hypothesised that the Aragonese lords of the tenancies of Zaragoza, Calatayud, and Daroca ‚Äì Pedro de Luesia, Loferrench de Luna, Pedro de Castillazuelo (lord of Calatayud), Pedro Cornel (lord of Murillo de G√°llego), and the majordomo Jimeno de Artusilla, all of whom disappear between 1177 and 1181 in the documentation of their tenancies ‚Äì supported, at least initially, the pretender. These lords also appear in the later legend of the Bell of Huesca, which has no historical basis, as the victims of Ramiro II (1136). Since, historically, they were not active in the 1130s, it is possible that the historically based legend of the pseudo-Alfonso had some influence on the genesis of the Bell of Huesca.

The earliest chronicle source for the imposture is Rodrigo Jim√©nez de Rada, writing in the middle of the thirteenth century, who records that there were several legends then current about the death of Alfonso the Battler: some believed he perished in the battle of Fraga, some that his body had never been recovered, others that he was buried in the monastery of Montearag√≥n, and still others that he had fled from Fraga in shame after his defeat and became a pilgrim as an act of penance. Some years later, Rodrigo writes, though he does not give a year, an impostor arose and was received by many as the Battler, though Alfonso II had him arrested and hanged. This is the earliest reference to the impostor&#x27;s end. The legend was amplified in later years. According to the fourteenth-century &quot;Cr√≥nica de los Estados Peninsulares&quot;, the Battler went on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, where he lived for many years. The &quot;Cr√≥nica de San Juan de la Pe√±a&quot; also recounts the incident, but it depends entirely on Rodrigo and the &quot;Estados Peninsulares&quot;. It is not until the seventeenth-century historian Jer√≥nimo Zurita penned his &quot;Anales de la Corona de Arag√≥n&quot; that new details were added to the legend. Zurita dates the impostor&#x27;s appearance to the death of Raymond Berengar IV of Barcelona, who had been exercising power in Aragon, and the succession of the child Alfonso II in 1162. The death of the impostor, by hanging, must have occurred in 1163.

<text>Amaryllis () is the only genus in the subtribe Amaryllidinae (tribe Amaryllideae). It is a small genus of flowering bulbs, with two species. The better known of the two, &quot;Amaryllis belladonna&quot;, is a native of the Western Cape region of South Africa, particularly the rocky southwest area between the Olifants River Valley and Knysna.

For many years there was confusion among botanists over the generic names &quot;Amaryllis&quot; and &quot;Hippeastrum&quot;, one result of which is that the common name &#x27;amaryllis&#x27; is mainly used for cultivars of the genus &quot;Hippeastrum&quot;, widely sold in the winter months for their ability to bloom indoors.

Plants of the genus &quot;Amaryllis&quot; are known as belladonna lily, Jersey lily, naked lady, amarillo, Easter lily in Southern Australia or, in South Africa, March lily due to its propensity to flower around March. This is one of numerous genera with the common name &#x27;lily&#x27; due to their flower shape and growth habit. However, they are only distantly related to the true lily, &quot;Lilium&quot;. In the Victorian language of flowers, amaryllis means &quot;love, beauty, and determination&quot;, and can also represent hope and achievement.

== Description ==

&quot;Amaryllis&quot; is a bulbous plant, with each bulb being in diameter. It has several strap-shaped, hysteranthous, green leaves with midrib, long and broad, arranged in two rows.

Each bulb produces one or two leafless, stout, persistent and erect stems tall, each of which bears at the top a cluster of two to twelve zygomorphic, funnel-shaped flowers without a tube. Each flower is in diameter with six spreading tepals (three outer sepals, three inner petals, with similar appearance to each other). The usual color is white with crimson veins, but pink or purple also occur naturally. Stamens are very shortly connate basally, declinate, unequal. Style is declinate, stigma is three-lobed. Ovules are approx. 8 per locule. Seeds are compressed-globose, white to pink. The number of chromosomes is 2&quot;n&quot; = 22.

==Taxonomy==
The single genus is in subtribe Amaryllidinae, in the tribe Amaryllideae. The taxonomy of the genus has been controversial. In 1753 Carl Linnaeus created the name &quot;Amaryllis belladonna&quot;, the type species of the genus &quot;Amaryllis&quot;. At the time both South African and South American plants were placed in the same genus; subsequently they were separated into two different genera. The key question is whether Linnaeus&#x27;s type was a South African plant or a South American plant. If the latter, &quot;Amaryllis&quot; would be the correct name for the genus &quot;Hippeastrum&quot;, and a different name would have to be used for the genus discussed here. Alan W. Meerow et al. have briefly summarized the debate, which took place from 1938 onwards and involved botanists on both sides of the Atlantic. The outcome was a decision by the 14th International Botanical Congress in 1987 that &quot;Amaryllis&quot; should be a conserved name (i.e. correct regardless of priority) and ultimately based on a specimen of the South African &quot;Amaryllis belladonna&quot; from the Clifford Herbarium at the Natural History Museum in London.

===Species===
, &quot;Amaryllis&quot; had only two accepted species, both native to the Cape Provinces of South Africa:
*&quot;Amaryllis belladonna&quot; ‚Äì south-west Cape Provinces; introduced into many parts of the world, including California, Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand
*&quot;Amaryllis paradisicola&quot; ‚Äì west Cape Provinces

=== Phylogeny ===
Amaryllidinae are placed within Amaryllideae as follow:

These are phylogenetically related as follows:

===Etymology ===
The name &quot;Amaryllis&quot; is taken from a shepherdess in Virgil&#x27;s pastoral &quot;Eclogues&quot;, (from the Greek .

Although the 1987 decision settled the question of the scientific name of the genus, the common name &#x27;amaryllis&#x27; continues to be used differently. Bulbs sold as amaryllis and described as &quot;ready to bloom for the holidays&quot; belong to the allied genus &quot;Hippeastrum&quot;. The common name &quot;naked lady&quot; comes from the plant&#x27;s pattern of flowering when the foliage has died down. This name is also used for other bulbs with a similar growth and flowering pattern; some of these have their own widely used and accepted common names, such as the resurrection lily (&quot;Lycoris squamigera&quot;).

== Habitat ==
In areas of its native habitat with mountainous fynbos, flowering tends to be suppressed until after bush fires as dense overhead vegetation prevents growth. In more open sandy areas of the Western Cape, the plant flowers annually. Plants tend to be very localized in dense concentrations due to the seeds&#x27; large size and heavy weight. Strong winds shake loose the seeds, which fall to ground and immediately start to germinate, aided by the first winter rains.

== Ecology ==
The leaves are produced in the autumn or early spring in warm climates depending on the onset of rain and eventually die down by late spring. The bulb is then dormant until late summer. The plant is not frost-tolerant, nor does it do well in tropical environments since they require a dry resting period between leaf growth and flower spike production.

One or two leafless stems arise from the bulb in the dry ground in late summer (March in its native habitat and August in USDA zone 7).

The plant has a symbiotic relationship with carpenter bees. It is also visited by noctuid moths at night. The relative importance of these insects as pollinators has not yet been established; however, carpenter bees are thought to be the main pollinators of amaryllis on the Cape Peninsula. The plant&#x27;s main parasite is the lily borer &quot;Brithys crini&quot; and/or &quot;Diaphone eumela&quot;.

==Cultivation==

&quot;Amaryllis belladonna&quot; was introduced into cultivation at the beginning of the eighteenth century. It reproduces slowly by either bulb division or seeds and has gradually naturalized from plantings in urban and suburban areas throughout the lower elevations and coastal areas in much of the West Coast of the US since these environments mimic their native South African habitat. Hardiness zones 6‚Äì8. It is also naturalized in Australia.

There is an &quot;Amaryllis belladonna&quot; hybrid which was bred in the 1800s in Australia. No one knows the exact species it was crossed with to produce color variations of white, cream, peach, magenta and nearly red hues. The hybrids were crossed back onto the original &quot;Amaryllis belladonna&quot; and with each other to produce naturally seed-bearing crosses that come in a very wide range of flower sizes, shapes, stem heights and intensities of pink. Pure white varieties with bright green stems were bred as well. The hybrids are quite distinct in that the many shades of pink also have stripes, veining, darkened edges, white centers and light yellow centers, also setting them apart from the original light pink. In addition, the hybrids often produce flowers in a fuller circle rather than the &quot;side-facing&quot; habit of the &quot;old-fashioned&quot; pink. The hybrids are able to adapt to year-round watering and fertilization but can also tolerate completely dry summer conditions if need be.

&quot;A.¬†belladonna&quot; has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

&quot;Amaryllis belladonna&quot; has been crossed in cultivation with &quot;Crinum moorei&quot; to produce a hybrid called √ó¬†&quot;Amarcrinum&quot;, which has named cultivars. Hybrids said to be between &quot;Amaryllis belladonna&quot; and &quot;Brunsvigia josephinae&quot; have been called √ó¬†&quot;Amarygia&quot;. Neither hybrid genus name is accepted by the &quot;World Checklist of Selected Plant Families&quot;.

<doc id="1683" wikidata="Q336855" url="?curid=1683" title="Alfonso III of Aragon">
<text>Alfonso III (4 November 1265 ‚Äì 18 June 1291), called the Liberal (&quot;el Liberal&quot;) and the Free (also &quot;the Frank&quot;, from &quot;el Franc&quot;), was king of Aragon and Valencia, and count of Barcelona (as ) from 1285 until his death. He conquered the Kingdom of Majorca between his succession and 1287.

==Life==
Alfonso was the son of King Peter¬†III of Aragon and Constance, daughter and heiress of King Manfred of Sicily.

Soon after assuming the throne, he conducted a campaign to reincorporate the Balearic Islands into the Crown of Aragon, which had been lost due to the division of the realm by his grandfather, James¬†I of Aragon. Thus in 1285 he declared war on his uncle, James¬†II of Majorca, and conquered both Majorca (1285) and Ibiza (1286), effectively reassuming suzerainty over the Kingdom of Majorca. He followed this with the conquest of Menorca ‚Äì until then an autonomous Muslim state (Man√ªrqa) within the Kingdom of Majorca ‚Äì on 17 January 1287, the anniversary of which now serves as Menorca&#x27;s national holiday.

Alfonso initially sought to maintain Aragonese control over Sicily by supporting the claims of his brother James¬†II to the island. However, he later retracted his support for his brother shortly before his death and instead tried to make peace with the Papal States and with France.

His reign was marred by a constitutional struggle with the Aragonese nobles, which eventually culminated in the articles of the Union of Aragon ‚Äì the so-called &quot;Magna Carta of Aragon&quot;, which devolved several key royal powers into the hands of lesser nobles. His inability to resist the demands of his nobles was to leave a heritage of disunity in Aragon and further dissent amongst the nobility, who increasingly saw little reason to respect the throne, and brought the Kingdom of Aragon close to anarchy.

During his lifetime a dynastic marriage with Eleanor, daughter of King Edward¬†I of England, was arranged. However, Alfonso died before meeting his bride, at the age of 25 in 1291, and was buried in the Franciscan convent in Barcelona; since 1852 his remains have been buried in Barcelona Cathedral.

==In culture==
Dante Alighieri, in the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, recounts that he saw Alfonso&#x27;s spirit seated outside the gates of Purgatory with the other monarchs whom Dante blamed for the chaotic political state of Europe during the 13th century.

<doc id="1684" wikidata="Q380088" url="?curid=1684" title="Alfonso IV of Aragon">
<text>Alfonso IV (2 November 1299 ‚Äì 24 January 1336), called the Kind (also &quot;the Gentle&quot; or &quot;the Nice&quot;, ), was King of Aragon and Count of Barcelona (as Alfons III) from 1327 to his death. His reign saw the incorporation of the County of Urgell, Duchy of Athens, and Duchy of Neopatria into the Crown of Aragon.

==Biography==
Alfonso was born in Naples, the second son of James II and Blanche of Anjou. In 1314, aged 14, he married Teresa d&#x27;Enten√ßa y Cabrera, heiress of Urgell, who was the same age as him. Teresa&#x27;s granduncle Ermengol X of Urgell had died childless in La Llitera; before his death, he had agreed to make Alfonso his heir, on condition that Alfonso would marry Teresa, who was his nearest kin. Alfonso was at this time only the second son (and not the heir) of the king of Aragon. He and his father readily agreed to Ermengol&#x27;s condition, and Alfonso married Teresa in 1314 in the Cathedral of Lerida. The teenage bridegroom is reputed to have been so liberal in the expenses during the wedding, that the local counsels imposed restrictions on how much he could spend. Alfonso and Teresa became the parents of seven children.

Alfonso became heir to the throne in December 1319 after his older brother James renounced his rights to become a monk. During the reign of his father, Alfonso was the procurator-general of the Crown, and in 1323‚Äì1324, he undertook the conquest of Sardinia.

Alfonso&#x27;s father and first wife Teresa died within a few days of each other in 1327. Teresa died in childbirth on 20 October 1327, and James II died on 2 November 1327, whereupon Alfonso became king. In 1329, he began a long war with the Republic of Genoa. The city of Sassari had previously surrendered to Alfonso in 1323, but rebelled three more times; its possession was contested by Genoa, which led to the protracted war.

In February 1329, Alfonso married Eleanor of Castile (1308‚Äì1359), the sister of king Alfonso XI of Castile. Eleanor had been briefly married to Alfonso&#x27;s elder brother James the monk. That marriage, which James had refused to consummate, had been annulled in 1319‚Äì20. Eleanor had thereafter retired to a convent (although she never took the veil) and had remained unmarried. By December the same year, the couple were rejoiced to become the parents of a son, Ferdinand, who was followed five years later by another son, John.

Eleanor earnestly sought to advance the interests of her own infant sons over those of her stepson, the &quot;Infante&quot; Peter, who was the heir-apparent. She convinced her husband to grant very large and significant territories to her sons. on 28 December 1329, Alfonso granted his new-born son Ferdinand the Marquisate of Tortosa and the cities of Albarrac√≠n, Orihuela, Callosa d&#x27;en Sarri√†, Guardamar, Alicante, Monforte, Elda, La Mola, Novelda and Aspe. Eleanor&#x27;s younger son John, who was born five years later, was also granted several lordships when he was only a toddler: Elche, Biel and Bolsa were all bestowed upon him. These territories would be controlled by Eleanor, who had also received the city of Huesca and some other villages and castles belonging to the Aragonese crown at the time of her wedding. Nor was this all. While all of the above grants had been made from among the possessions of the Aragonese crown, the King also sought to bestow estates located within the Kingdom of Valencia upon the toddler Ferdinand, but he was prevented from doing so. When the King granted Ferdinand the cities of X√†tiva, Alzira, Sagunto, Morella, Burriana and Castell√≥n de la Plana, all located in the Kingdom of Valencia, the local subjects protested, and for this reason the King decided to revoked these patents. These grants of land diminished the territorial patrimony of the crown and mainly affected the &quot;Infante&quot; Peter, Alfonso&#x27;s son by his first wife, who however was too young to make any significant protest. However, the issue agitated the court, created a climate of resentment and divided the nobility into two camps.

Alfonso died in January 1336, aged only 36. He was succeeded by Peter IV, his 16-year-old son from his first marriage.

<text>Amasis II ( ; &quot;·∏§MS&quot;) or Ahmose II was a pharaoh (reigned 570526 BCE) of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt, the successor of Apries at Sais. He was the last great ruler of Egypt before the Persian conquest.

==Life==

Most of our information about him is derived from Herodotus (2.161ff) and can only be imperfectly verified by monumental evidence. According to the Greek historian, he was of common origins. He was originally an officer in the Egyptian army. His birthplace was Siuph at Sa√Øs. He took part in a general campaign of Pharaoh Psamtik II in 592 BC in Nubia.

A revolt which broke out among native Egyptian soldiers gave him his opportunity to seize the throne. These troops, returning home from a disastrous military expedition to Cyrene in Libya, suspected that they had been betrayed in order that Apries, the reigning king, might rule more absolutely by means of his Greek mercenaries; many Egyptians fully sympathized with them. General Amasis, sent to meet them and quell the revolt, was proclaimed king by the rebels instead, and Apries, who then had to rely entirely on his mercenaries, was defeated (though it is suggested that Apries had more native support than classical sources describe). Apries then fled to an &quot;island&quot; (possibly an elevated or isolated base of Apries within Egypt) and was killed while mounting a final insurrection against Amasis in 567 BCE with the aid of a shipped force (probably Greek and maybe Carian), while the Babylonians also invaded Egypt the same year. An inscription confirms the struggle between the native Egyptian and the foreign soldiery, and proves that Apries was killed and honourably buried in the fourth year of Amasis ( BCE). Amasis&#x27; revolt against Apries is also alluded to in Jeremiah 44:30. Amasis then married Khedebneithirbinet II, one of the daughters of his predecessor Apries, in order to legitimise his kingship.

Some information is known about the family origins of Amasis: his mother was a certain Tashereniset, as a bust of her, today located in the British Museum, shows. A stone block from Mehallet el-Kubra also establishes that his maternal grandmother‚ÄîTashereniset&#x27;s mother‚Äîwas a certain Tjenmutetj.

His court is relatively well known. The head of the gate guard Ahmose-sa-Neith appears on numerous monuments, including the location of his sarcophagus. He was referenced on monuments of the 30th Dynasty and apparently had a special significance in his time. Wahibre was &#x27;Leader of the southern foreigners&#x27; and &#x27;Head of the doors of foreigners&#x27;, so he was the highest official for border security. Under Amasis the career of the doctor, Udjahorresnet, began, who was of particular importance to the Persians. Several &quot;heads of the fleet&quot; are known. Psamtek Meryneit and Pasherientaihet / Padineith are the only known viziers.
Herodotus describes how Amasis II would eventually cause a confrontation with the Persian armies. According to Herodotus, Amasis was asked by Cambyses II or Cyrus the Great for an Egyptian ophthalmologist on good terms. Amasis seems to have complied by forcing an Egyptian physician into mandatory labor, causing him to leave his family behind in Egypt and move to Persia in forced exile. In an attempt to exact revenge for this, the physician grew very close to Cambyses and suggested that Cambyses should ask Amasis for a daughter in marriage in order to solidify his bonds with the Egyptians. Cambyses complied and requested a daughter of Amasis for marriage.

Amasis, worrying that his daughter would be a concubine to the Persian king, refused to give up his offspring; Amasis also was not willing to take on the Persian empire, so he concocted a deception in which he forced the daughter of the ex-pharaoh Apries, whom Herodotus explicitly confirms to have been killed by Amasis, to go to Persia instead of his own offspring.

This daughter of Apries was none other than Nitetis, who was, as per Herodotus&#x27;s account, &quot;tall and beautiful.&quot; Nitetis naturally betrayed Amasis and upon being greeted by the Persian king explained Amasis&#x27;s trickery and her true origins. This infuriated Cambyses and he vowed to take revenge for it. Amasis died before Cambyses reached him, but his heir and son Psamtik III was defeated by the Persians.

Herodotus also describes how, just like his predecessor, Amasis relied on Greek mercenaries and councilmen. One such figure was Phanes of Halicarnassus, who would later leave Amasis, for reasons that Herodotus does not clearly know, but suspects were personal between the two figures. Amasis sent one of his eunuchs to capture Phanes, but the eunuch was bested by the wise councilman and Phanes fled to Persia, meeting up with Cambyses and providing advice for his invasion of Egypt. Egypt was finally lost to the Persians during the battle of Pelusium in 525 BC.

==Egypt&#x27;s wealth==

Amasis brought Egypt into closer contact with Greece than ever before. Herodotus relates that under his prudent administration, Egypt reached a new level of wealth; Amasis adorned the temples of Lower Egypt especially with splendid monolithic shrines and other monuments (his activity here is proved by existing remains). For example, a shrine built by him was excavated at Tell Nebesha.

Amasis was described by Herodotus as a philhellene. He assigned the commercial colony of Naucratis on the Canopic branch of the Nile to the Greeks, and when the temple of Delphi was burnt, he contributed 1,000 talents to the rebuilding. He also married a Greek princess named Ladice daughter of King Battus III and made alliances with Polycrates of Samos and Croesus of Lydia. Montaigne cites the story by Herodotus that Ladice cured Amasis of his impotence by praying to Aphrodite.

Under Amasis, Egypt&#x27;s agricultural based economy reached its zenith. Herodotus, who visited Egypt less than a century after Amasis II&#x27;s death, writes that:
His kingdom consisted probably of Egypt only, as far as the First Cataract, but to this he added Cyprus, and his influence was great in Cyrene, Libya. In his fourth year ( BCE), Egypt was invaded by the Babylonians, under the leadership of Nebuchadnezzar II. It is believed that Amasis managed to repel this invasion, forcing Nebuchadnezzar II to retire plans to conquer his kingdom. (However, some have suggested that Nebuchadnezzar came to defeat Apries, the combined forces of Amasis and Nebuchadnezzar managing to kill him, securing Amasis&#x27; throne, though as vassal king.) Amasis was later faced with another formidable enemy with the rise of Persia under Cyrus who ascended to the throne in 559 BCE; his final years were preoccupied by the threat of the impending Persian onslaught against Egypt. With great strategic skill, Cyrus had destroyed Lydia in 546 BCE and finally defeated the Babylonians in 538 BCE which left Amasis with no major Near Eastern allies to counter Persia&#x27;s increasing military might. Amasis reacted by cultivating closer ties with the Greek states to counter the future Persian invasion into Egypt but died in 526 BCE shortly before the Persians attacked. The final assault instead fell upon his son Psamtik III, whom the Persians defeated in 525 BCE after he had reigned for only six months.

==Tomb and desecration==

Amasis II died in 526 BC. He was buried at the royal necropolis of Sais within the temple enclosure of Neith, and while his tomb has not been rediscovered, Herodotus describes it for us:

Herodotus also relates the desecration of Amasis&#x27; mummy when the Persian king Cambyses conquered Egypt and thus ended the 26th (Saite) Dynasty:
==Later reputation==

From the fifth century BCE, there is evidence of stories circulating about Amasis, in Egyptian sources (including a demotic papyrus of the third century BCE), Herodotus, Hellanikos, and Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Convivium Septem Sapientium&quot;. &#x27;In those tales Amasis was presented as a non-conventional Pharaoh, behaving in ways unbecoming to a king but gifted with practical wisdom and cunning, a trickster on the throne or a kind of comic Egyptian Solomon&#x27;.
For example, Herodotus relates that, when the Egyptians disrespected Amasis for having been born a commoner, he had his golden footbath () melted down, made into a statue of a god, and placed in the centre of city where people would worship it. After the people of that city had worhsipped and &quot;did great reverence&quot; to it, Amasis gathered them and declared to them that the golden image they now worshipped had once been a footbath where people would vomit, urinate and wash their feet. He claimed that likewise, although he was once a man of the people, he was now their king and they ought to fittingly respect him.

On another occasion, Herodotus tells that Amasis&#x27; friends admonished him for spending his time frivolously instead of on governing the country. He responded to them that archers stretch their bows only when they need them, because if they kept them constantly stretched the bows would break. &quot;So also is the state of man: if he should always be in earnest and not relax himself for sport at the due time, he would either go mad or be struck with stupor before he was aware; and knowing this well, I distribute a portion of the time to each of the two ways of living.&quot;

<doc id="1686" wikidata="Q312304" url="?curid=1686" title="Alfonso V of Aragon">
<text>Alfonso the Magnanimous (Alfons el Magn√†nim in Catalan) (139627 June 1458) was King of Aragon and King of Sicily (as Alfons V) and the ruler of the Crown of Aragon from 1416 and King of Naples (as Alfons I) from 1442 until his death. He was involved with struggles to the throne of the Kingdom of Naples with Louis III of Anjou, Joanna II of Naples and their supporters, but ultimately failed and lost Naples in 1424. He recaptured it in 1442 and was crowned king of Naples. He had good relations with his vassal, Stjepan Kosaƒça, and his ally, Skanderbeg, providing assistance in their struggles in the Balkans. He led diplomatic contacts with the Ethiopian Empire and was a prominent political figure of the early Renaissance, being a supporter of literature as well as commissioning several constructions for the Castel Nuovo.

==Early life==
Born at Medina del Campo, he was the son of Ferdinand of Trast√°mara and Eleanor of Alburquerque. Ferdinand was the brother of King Henry III of Castile, and Alfonso was betrothed to his uncle King Henry&#x27;s daughter Maria in 1408. In 1412, Ferdinand was selected to succeed to the territories of the Crown of Aragon. Alfonso and Maria&#x27;s marriage was celebrated in Valencia on 12 June 1415.

King Ferdinand died on 2 April 1416, and Alfonso succeeded him as king of Aragon, Valencia, and Majorca and count of Barcelona. He also claimed the island of Sardinia, though it was then in the possession of Genoa. Alfonso was also in possession of much of Corsica by the 1420s.

Alfonso&#x27;s marriage with Maria was childless. His mistress Lucrezia d&#x27;Alagno served as a &quot;de facto&quot; queen at the Neapolitan court as well as an inspiring muse. With another mistress, , Alfonso had three children: Ferdinand (1423‚Äì1494), Maria (who married Leonello d&#x27;Este), and Eleanor (who married Mariano Marzano). With 
the last mistress Ippolita, married de&#x27;Giudici, Alfonso had one daughther Colia (1430-1473/5) married in 1445 with Emanuele d&#x27;Appiano, Lord of Piombino, Count of Holy Roman Empire. The d&#x27;Appiano d&#x27;Aragona family received, in 1509 the title of Prince of Holy Roman Empire.

Alfonso was the object of diplomatic contacts from the Empire of Ethiopia. In 1428, he received a letter from Yeshaq I of Ethiopia, borne by two dignitaries, which proposed an alliance against the Muslims and would be sealed by a dual marriage that would require Alfonso&#x27;s brother Peter to bring a group of artisans to Ethiopia where he would marry Yeshaq&#x27;s daughter. In return, Alfonso sent a party of 13 craftsmen, all of whom perished on the way to Ethiopia. He later sent a letter to Yeshaq&#x27;s successor Zara Yaqob in 1450, in which he wrote that he would be happy to send artisans to Ethiopia if their safe arrival could be guaranteed, but it probably never reached Zara Yaqob.

==Struggle for Naples==
===First attempt===

In 1421 the childless Queen Joanna II of Naples adopted and named him as heir to the Kingdom of Naples, and Alfonso went to Naples. Here he hired the condottiero Braccio da Montone with the task of reducing the resistance of his rival claimant, Louis III of Anjou, and his forces led by Muzio Attendolo Sforza. With Pope Martin V supporting Sforza, Alfonso switched his religious allegiance to the Aragonese antipope Benedict XIII. When Sforza abandoned Louis&#x27; cause, Alfonso seemed to have all his problems solved; however, his relationship with Joanna suddenly worsened, and in May 1423 he had her lover, Gianni Caracciolo, a powerful figure in the Neapolitan court, arrested.

After an attempt to arrest the queen herself had failed, Joan called on Sforza who defeated the Aragonese militias near Castel Capuano in Naples. Alfonso fled to Castel Nuovo, but the help of a fleet of 22 galleys led by Giovanni da Cardona improved his situation. Sforza and Joanna ransomed Caracciolo and retreated to the fortress of Aversa. Here she repudiated her earlier adoption of Alfonso and, with the backing of Martin V, named Louis III as her heir instead.

The duke of Milan, Filippo Maria Visconti, joined the anti-Aragonese coalition. Alfonso requested support from Braccio da Montone, who was besieging Joanna&#x27;s troops in L&#x27;Aquila, but had to set sail for Spain, where a war had broken out between his brothers and the Kingdom of Castile. On his way towards Barcelona, Alfonso sacked Marseille, a possession of Louis III.

In late 1423 the Genoese fleet of Filippo Maria Visconti moved in the southern Tyrrhenian Sea, rapidly conquering Gaeta, Procida, Castellammare and Sorrento. Naples, which was held by Alfonso&#x27;s brother, Pedro de Aragon, was besieged in 1424 by the Genoese ships and Joanna&#x27;s troops, now led by Francesco Sforza, the son of Muzio Sforza (who had met his death at L&#x27;Aquila). The city fell in April 1424. Pedro, after a short resistance in Castel Nuovo, fled to Sicily in August. Joanna II and Louis III again took possession of the realm, although the true power was in the hands of Gianni Caracciolo.
===Second attempt===

An opportunity for Alfonso to reconquer Naples occurred in 1432, when Caracciolo was killed in a conspiracy. Alfonso tried to regain the favour of the queen, but failed, and had to wait for the death of both Louis (at Cosenza in 1434) and Joanna herself (February 1435). In her will, she bequeathed her realm to Ren√© of Anjou, Louis III&#x27;s younger brother. This solution was opposed by the new pope, Eugene IV, who was the feudal overlord of the Kingdom of Naples. The Neapolitans having called in the French, Alfonso decided to intervene and, with the support of several barons of the kingdom, captured Capua and besieged the important sea fortress of Gaeta. His fleet of 25 galleys was met by the Genoese ships sent by Visconti, led by Biagio Assereto. In the Battle of Ponza that ensued, Alfonso was defeated and taken prisoner.

In Milan, Alfonso impressed his captor with his cultured demeanor and persuaded him to let him go by persuading that it was not in Milan&#x27;s interest to prevent the victory of the Aragonese party in Naples. Helped by a Sicilian fleet, Alfonso recaptured Capua and set his base in Gaeta in February 1436. Meanwhile, papal troops had invaded the Neapolitan kingdom, but Alfonso bribed their commander, Cardinal Giovanni Vitelleschi, and their successes waned.

In the meantime, Ren√© had managed to reach Naples on 19 May 1438. Alfonso tried to besiege the city in the following September, but failed. His brother Pedro was killed during the battle. Castel Nuovo, where an Aragonese garrison resisted, fell to the Angevine mercenaries in August 1439. After the death of his condottiero Jacopo Caldora, however, Ren√©&#x27;s fortune started to decline: Alfonso could easily capture Aversa, Salerno, Benevento, Manfredonia and Bitonto. Ren√©, whose possession included now only part of the Abruzzi and Naples, obtained 10,000 men from the pope, but the cardinal leading them signed a truce with Alfonso. Giovanni Sforza came with a reduced corps, as troops sent by Eugene IV had halted his father Francesco in the Marche.

Alfonso, provided with the most impressive artillery of the times, again besieged Naples. The siege began on 10 November 1441, ending on 2 June the following year. After the return of Ren√© to Provence, Alfonso easily reduced the remaining resistance and made his triumphal entrance in Naples on 26 February 1443, as the monarch of a pacified kingdom.

Alfonso then reunited under his dominion the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily, divided since the Sicilian Vespers. After the personal union, he began to call himself &quot;Rex Utriusque Siciliae&quot;; this was then used by other kings and his successors who ruled over those territories.

==Art and administration==
Like many Renaissance rulers, Alfonso V was a patron of the arts. He founded the academy of Naples under Giovanni Pontano, and for his entrance into the city in 1443 had a magnificent triumphal arch added to the main gate of Castel Nuovo. Alfonso V supplied the theme of Renaissance sculptures over the west entrance.

Alfonso was particularly attracted to classical literature. He reportedly brought copies of the works of Livy and Julius Caesar on his campaigns; the poet Antonio Beccadelli even claimed that Alfonso was cured of a disease by the reading of a few pages from Quintus Curtius Rufus&#x27; history of Alexander the Great. Although this reputed erudition attracted scholars to his court, Alfonso apparently enjoyed pitting them against each other in spectacles of bawdy Latin rhetoric.

After his conquest of Naples in 1442, Alfonso ruled primarily through his mercenaries and political lackeys. In his Italian kingdom, he maintained the former political and administrative institutions. His holdings in Spain were governed by his wife Maria.

A unified General Chancellorship for the whole Aragonese realm was set up in Naples, although the main functionaries were of Aragonese nationality. Apart from financial, administrative and artistic improvements, his other accomplishments in the Sicilian kingdom include the restoration of the aqueducts, the drainage of marshy areas, and the paving of streets.

Alfonso founded the first university of Sicily, the &quot;Siciliae Studium Generale&quot;.

== Later life==

Alfonso was also a powerful and faithful supporter of Skanderbeg, whom he decided to take under his protection as a vassal in 1451, shortly after the latter had scored his second victory against Murad II. In addition to financial assistance, he supplied the Albanian leader with troops, military equipment, and sanctuary for himself and his family if such a need should arise. This was because in 1448, while Skanderbeg was fighting off the Turkish invasions, three military columns, commanded by Demetrio Reres along with his sons Giorgio and Basilio, had been dispatched to help Alfonso V defeat the barons of Naples who had rebelled against him.

He also supported Bosnian duke, Stjepan Vukƒçiƒá Kosaƒça, who turned to the king for help in his affairs in Bosnia. Alfonso made him &quot;Knight of the Virgin&quot;, but did not provide any troops. On 15¬†February 1444, Stjepan signed a treaty with the king of Aragon and Naples, becoming his vassal in exchange for Alfonso&#x27;s help against his enemies‚ÄîStephen Thomas and Ivani≈° Pavloviƒá (1441‚Äì1450) of the Pavloviƒá noble family as well as the Republic of Venice. In the same treaty, Stjepan promised to pay Alfonso regular tribute instead of paying the Ottoman sultan as he had done until then.

Alfonso, by formally submitting his reign to the Papacy, obtained the consent of Pope Eugene IV that the Kingdom of Naples would go to his illegitimate son, Ferdinand. He died in Castel dell&#x27;Ovo in 1458, while he was planning the conquest of Genoa. At the time, Alfonso was at odds with Pope Callixtus III, who died shortly afterwards. Alfonso&#x27;s Iberian possessions had been ruled for him by his brother, who succeeded him as John II of Aragon. Sicily and Sardinia were also inherited by John II.

==Marriage and issue==

Alfonso had been betrothed to his first cousin Maria of Castile (1401‚Äì1458; sister of John II of Castile) in Valladolid in 1408; the marriage was celebrated in Valencia on 12 June 1415. They failed to produce children. Alfonso had been in love with a woman of noble family named Lucrezia d&#x27;Alagno, who served as a &quot;de facto&quot; queen at the Neapolitan court as well as an inspiring muse.

Genealogical records in the Old Occitan Chronicle of Montpellier in &quot;Le petit Thalamus de Montpellier&quot; indicate that Alphonso&#x27;s relationship with his mistress, Giraldona Carlino (daughter of Enrique Carlino and his wife, Isabel), produced three children:

* His successor in Naples, King Ferdinand I of Naples, (born 1423; reigned 1458‚Äì1494).
* (1425‚Äì1449) (died 1449, aged around 23 or 24). She had married in 1444 Leonello d&#x27;Este, deceased 1450.
* Leonora d&#x27;Aragona, who married c. 1443, Mariano Marzano, Duke of Squillace, Prince of Rossano. Her daughter Francesca married Leonardo III Tocco.

<text>Amathus or Amathous () was an ancient city and one of the ancient royal cities of Cyprus until about 300 BC. Some of its remains can be seen today on the southern coast in front of Agios Tychonas, about east of Limassol and west of Larnaca. Its ancient cult sanctuary of Aphrodite was the second most important in Cyprus, her homeland, after Paphos.

Archaeological work has recently been continued at the site and many finds are exhibited in the Limassol Museum.

==History==
===Pre-history and ancient era===

The pre-history of Amathus survives in both myth and archaeology. No traces of human activity was detected in the site before the earliest Iron Age, BC, and no town is mentioned in the space between Kition and Kourion in the list of Cypriot cities from Medinet Habu. 
The city&#x27;s legendary founder was Cinyras, linked with the birth of Adonis, who called the city after his mother Amathous. According to a version of the Ariadne legend noted by Plutarch, Theseus abandoned Ariadne at Amathousa, where she died giving birth to her child and was buried in a sacred tomb. According to Plutarch&#x27;s source, Amathousians called the sacred grove where her shrine was situated the Wood of Aphrodite Ariadne. myth would have Amathus settled instead by one of the sons of Heracles, named Amathes (·ºàŒºŒ¨Œ∏Œ∑œÇ), thus accounting for the fact that he was worshiped there.
It was said in antiquity that the people of Amathus were autochthonous, most likely Eteocyprian or &quot;Pelasgian&quot;. Their non-Greek language is confirmed on the site by Eteocypriot inscriptions in the Cypriot syllabary which alone in the Aegean world survived the Bronze Age collapse and continued to be used down to the 4th century BC.
Amathus was built on the coastal cliffs with a natural harbour and flourished at an early date, soon requiring several cemeteries. Greeks from Euboea left their pottery at Amathus from the 10th century BC. During the post-Phoenician era of the 8th century BC, a palace was erected and a port was also constructed, which served the trade with the Greeks and the Levantines. A special burial ground for infants, a &quot;tophet&quot; served the culture of the Phoenicians. For the Hellenes, high on the cliff a temple was built, which became a worship site devoted to Aphrodite, in her particular local presence as &quot;Aphrodite Amathusia&quot; along with a bearded male Aphrodite called &quot;Aphroditos&quot;. The excavators discovered the final stage of the Temple of Aphrodite, also known as Aphrodisias, which dates approximately to the 1st century BC. According to the legend, it was where festive Adonia took place, in which athletes competed in hunting wild boars during sport competitions; they also competed in dancing and singing, all to the honour of Adonis.
The earliest remains hitherto found on the site are tombs of the early Iron Age period of Graeco-Phoenician influences (1000-600 BC). Amathus is sometimes identified with &quot;Qarti·∏´adasti&quot; (Phoenician &quot;New-Town&quot;) in the Cypriote tribute-list of Esarhaddon of Assyria (668 BC) and some Phoenician inscriptions from the island, although others identify this &quot;Qarti·∏´adasti&quot; with Kition or a part of it. It certainly maintained strong Phoenician sympathies, for it was its refusal to join the philhellene league of Onesilos of Salamis which provoked the revolt of Cyprus from Achaemenid Persia in 500-494 BC, when Amathus was besieged unsuccessfully and avenged itself by the capture and execution of Onesilos. Herodotus reports
:&quot;Because he had besieged them, the Amathusians cut off Onesilos‚Äô head and brought it to Amathous, where they hung it above the gates. As it hung there empty, a swarm of bees entered it and filled it with honeycomb. When they sought advice about this event, an oracle told them to take the head down and bury it, and to make annual sacrifice to Onesilos as a hero, saying that it would be better for them if they did this. The Amathusians did as they were told and still perform these rites in my day.&quot; (&quot;Histories&quot; 5.114)

Amathus was a rich and densely populated kingdom with a flourishing agriculture (grain and sheep) and copper mines situated very close to the northeast Kalavasos.
===Hellenistic era===

About 385-380 BC, the philhellene Evagoras of Salamis was similarly opposed by Amathus, allied with Citium and Soli; and even after Alexander the city resisted annexation, and was bound over to give hostages to Seleucus. Its political importance was now ended but its temple of Adonis and Aphrodite Amathusia remained famous in Roman times. The epithet &quot;Amathusia&quot; in Roman poetry often means little more than &quot;Cypriote,&quot; but attesting to the fame of the city.

From the 4th century BC the pedestals of two sculptures donated by the last Basileus of Amathous, Androkles, representing his two sons, Orestheus and Andragoras, have survived. Their inscriptions are in both Eteocyprian and Greek languages.

The decline of Amathus is often measured by the Ptolemaic gifts to Argos, where Amathus donated only 40 drachmas in 170-160 BC, but Kition and Salamis gave 208, Kourion 172, and Paphos 100. However, this figure contradicts the archaeologic evidence of new buildings in this period including a balneion, a bath, a gymnasium, as well as fortifications of the Acropolis, including a new tower. The port of Paphos appears to have lost traffic compared to Amathus in the Ptolemaic period, an indication that Paphos, as the capital of the island, perhaps offered fewer drachmas than the other cities for different reasons, like Amathus.

===Roman era===

In the Roman era Amathus became the capital of one of the four administrative regions of Cyprus.

A Roman temple was built in the 1st century AD on top of the Hellenistic predecessor. The temple facilities remained so important in Roman times that &#x27;Amathusia&#x27; was used as a synonym for &#x27;Cypriot&#x27;.

===Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages===
Later, in the 4th century AD, Amasus became the see of a Christian bishop and continued to flourish until the Byzantine period. Of its bishops, Heliodorus was at the Council of Chalcedon in 451 and Alexander at the Second Council of Nicaea in 787. In the late 6th century, Saint Ioannis Eleimonas (John the Charitable), protector of the Knights of St. John, was born in Amathus and after 614 sent Theodorus, bishop of Amathus, to Jerusalem to ransom some slaves.

Today, Amathus is a see of the Church of Cyprus and is also listed (under the name &quot;Amathus in Cypro&quot;, to distinguish it from &quot;Amathus in Transjordan&quot;) as a titular see by the Catholic Church, which however, in line with the practice adopted after the Second Vatican Council, has made no appointments to the bishopric since the death of the last Latin titular bishop in 1984.

Anastasius Sinaita, the famous 7th-century prolific monk of Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery, was born here. It is thought that he left Cyprus after the 649 Arab conquest of the island, setting out for the Holy Land, and eventually becoming a monk on Sinai.

Amathus declined and was already almost deserted when Richard Plantagenet won Cyprus by a victory there over Isaac Comnenus in 1191. The tombs were plundered and the stones from the beautiful edifices were brought to Limassol to be used for new constructions. Much later, in 1869, a great number of blocks of stone from Amathus were used for the construction of the Suez Canal. A ruined Byzantine church marks its site.

===In modern times===
A new settlement close to Amathus but further inland, Agios Tychonas, is named after the bishop Saint Tychon of Amathus. The site of the ruins is within the borders of this village, though the expansion of the Limassol tourist area has threatened the ruins: it is speculated that some of the hotels are on top of the Amathus necropolis.

==The site and archaeology==

=== The Swedish Cyprus Expedition ===

From April to May 1930 The Swedish Cyprus Expedition excavated a necropolis on both sides of Amathus&#x27;acropolis. Amathus was known and visited during the 18th century and 19th centuries by travelers and archaeologists. Earlier excavators, such as General Luigi Palma Di Cesnola, the first American consul in Cyprus, excavated the necropolis&#x27; large tombs situated north of the acropolis and the tombs in the necropolis west of the acropolis hill. Since he did not publish any plans or drawings John Lindros illustrated two of the tombs from the old excavations that were still possible to visit. The necropolis had partly been excavated by the English Expedition to Cyprus in 1893-94 and published in &quot;Excavations in Cyprus&quot;, London 1900. The Swedish Cyprus Expedition excavated around 25 tombs.
The tombs excavated are shaft tombs with a dromos, which are rather rare in Cyprus. Variations of the shaft tombs occur, mostly because of the various circumstances of space and economics as well as difficulties in cutting the rock. The archaeologist identified six different styles. It is the shape of the dromos that differs the most between the different styles. Tombs 1 and 2 differ from the others in the sense of construction and quality and might have been created for wealthier people, maybe royals. Tomb 3 is more reminiscent of the other graves found in Cyprus since it is a chamber tomb. Tomb no. 26 had a large tumulus and might have been related to other Hellenistic tumuli. It contained a stone pithos with an alabastron in which a burnt skeleton was found. Around the rim of the alabastron a wreath of gilded myrtle leaves was placed. The excavator thought it might have been a Ptolemaic official who died in Amathus and was buried according to a foreign burial custom.

Otherwise, the same burial customs were observed in most of the tombs. Many were reused multiple times, in which case the burial gifts were pushed into the corner of the tomb. Later, during the Hellenistic and Roman periods, Amathus was once again used for burial. These burials did not damage or alternate the earlier tombs since they were usually somewhere in the upper layers. The tombs are dated from the Cypro-Geometric I to the Roman period.

=== Later Excavations ===
The city had vanished, except for fragments of wall and of a great stone urn on the acropolis, dating from the 6th century BC of which a similar vessel was taken to the Mus√©e du Louvre in 1867. It is tall and weighs 14 tons. It was made from a single piece of stone and has four curved handles carved with bulls. In the 1870s, Luigi Palma di Cesnola excavated the necropolis of Amathus, as elsewhere in Cyprus, enriching the early collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art; some objects went to the British Museum. More modern archaeological joint Cypriote-French excavations started in 1980 and still continue. The Acropolis, the Temple of Aphrodite, the agora, the city&#x27;s walls, the basilica and the port have all been excavated.

Further archaeological objects found during the excavations are preserved at both the Cyprus Museum in Nicosia and the Limassol District Archaeological Museum.
In the agora there are marble columns decorated with spirals and a huge paved squares. On the coastal side of the city there is an Early Christian basilica with mosaic floors decorated with semi-precious stones. Further, near the terraced road leading to the Temple, situated on the top of the cliff, several houses built in a row dating to the Hellenistic period have been discovered. At the east and west extremes of the city the two acropoleis are situated where a number of tombs have been found, many of which are intact.

Two small sanctuaries, with terracotta votive offerings of Graeco-Phoenician age, lie not far off, but the location of the great shrines of Adonis and Aphrodite have not been identified (M. Ohnefalsch-Richter, &quot;Kypros,&quot; i. ch.1).

<text>Alphons (Latinized &quot;Alphonsus&quot;, &quot;Adelphonsus&quot;, or &quot;Adefonsus&quot;) is a male given name recorded from the 8th century (Alfonso I of Asturias, r. 739‚Äì757) in the Christian successor states of the Visigothic Kingdom in the Iberian Peninsula. In the later medieval period it became a standard name in the Hispanic and Portuguese royal families.

It is derived from a Gothic name, or a conflation of several Gothic names; from &quot;*A√æalfuns&quot;, composed of the elements &quot;a√æal&quot; &quot;noble&quot; and &quot;funs&quot; &quot;eager, brave, ready&quot;, and perhaps influenced by names such as &quot;*Alafuns&quot;, &quot;*Adefuns&quot; and &quot;*Hildefuns&quot;.
It is recorded as &quot;Adefonsus&quot; in the 9th and 10th century, and as &quot;Adelfonsus&quot;, &quot;Adelphonsus&quot; in the 10th to 11th. The reduced form &quot;Alfonso&quot; is recorded in the late 9th century, and the Portuguese form &quot;Afonso&quot; from the early 11th and &quot;Anf√≥s&quot; in Catalan from the 12th century until the 15th. 
Variants of the name include: &quot;Alonso&quot; (Spanish), &quot;Alfonso&quot; (Spanish and Italian), &quot;Alfons&quot; (Dutch, German, Catalan, Polish, Croatian and Scandinavian), &quot;Afonso&quot; (Portuguese and Galician), &quot;Alphonse&quot;, &quot;Alfonse&quot; (French and English), etc.

<doc id="1690" wikidata="Q455758" url="?curid=1690" title="Amati">
<text>Amati (, ) is the last name of a family of Italian violin makers who lived at Cremona from about 1538 to 1740. Their importance is considered equal to those of the Bergonzi, Guarneri, and Stradivari families. Today, violins created by Nicol√≤ Amati are valued at around $600,000. Because of their age and rarity, Amati instruments are mostly kept in a museum or private collections and are seldom played in public.

==Family members==

===Andrea Amati===

Andrea Amati (20 December 1577) designed and created the violin, viola and cello known as the &quot;violin family&quot;. Based in Cremona, Italy, he standardized the basic form, shape, size, materials and method of construction. Makers from nearby Brescia experimented, such as Gasparo da Sal√≤, Micheli, Zanetto and Pellegrino, but it was Andrea Amati who gave the modern violin family their definitive profile.

A claim that Andrea Amati received the first order for a violin from Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici in 1555 is invalid as Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici died in 1492. A number of Andrea Amati&#x27;s instruments survived for some time, dating between 1538 (Amati made the first Cello called &quot;The King&quot; in 1538) and 1574. The largest number of these are from 1560, a set for an entire orchestra of 38 ordered by Catherine de M√©dicis the regent queen of France and bore hand painted royal French decorations in gold including the motto and coat of arms of her son Charles IX of France. Of these 38 instruments ordered, Amati created violins of two sizes, violas of two sizes and large-sized cellos. They were in use until the French revolution of 1789 and only 14 of these instruments survived. His work is marked by selection of the finest materials, great elegance in execution, soft clear amber, soft translucent varnish, and an in depth use of acoustic and geometrical principles in design.
=== Antonio and Girolamo Amati ===
Andrea Amati was succeeded by his sons Antonio Amati (‚Äì1607) and Girolamo Amati (‚Äì1630). &quot;The Brothers Amati&quot;, as they were known, implemented far-reaching innovations in design, including the perfection of the shape of the f-holes. They are also thought to have pioneered the modern alto format of viola, in contrast to older tenor violas, but the widespread belief that they were the first ones to do so 

===Nicol√≤ Amati===

Nicol√≤ Amati (3 December 159612 April 1684) was the son of Girolamo Amati. Often considered the most eminent violin maker of the family, he improved the model adopted by the rest of the Amatis and produced instruments capable of yielding greater power of tone. His pattern was unusually small, but he also made a wider model now known as the &quot;Grand Amati&quot;, which have become his most sought-after violins.

Of his pupils, the most famous were Antonio Stradivari and Andrea Guarneri, the first of the Guarneri family of violin makers. (There is much controversy regarding the apprenticeship of Antonio Stradivari. While the label on Stradivari&#x27;s first known violin states that he was a pupil of Amati, the validity of his statement is questioned.

=== Girolamo Amati (Hieronymus II) ===
The last maker of the family was Nicol√≤&#x27;s son, Girolamo Amati, known as Hieronymus II (26 February 164921 February 1740). He improved the arching of his father&#x27;s instruments.

==Extant Amati instruments==

Amati instruments include some of the oldest extant examples of the violin family, dating to as far back as the mid-16th century. , they are only occasionally played in public.

Instruments in the UK include Andrea Amati violins from the set delivered to Charles IX of France in 1564.

====The Stanley Solomon Tenore ca 1536====

Andrea Amati ca 1536

Originally a tenor viola, the front is of pine of slightly wavy grain of medium width. The back is one-piece of maple, slab-cut, slightly flamed but with evident circular decorations. The little scroll is later, but it matches the instrument. The varnish is golden brown.

====The Witten, The IX Charles, The ex Collis ca 1560====

Andrea Amati ca 1560

This rare viola is one of the best preserved of Andrea Amati&#x27;s decorated instruments. It features gilt paintings of fleurs-de-lis and trefoils on its back, surrounding the monogram identified by Italian scholar Renato Meucci to be that of Marguerite de Valois-Angoul√™me. The Latin motto painted in gilt around the monogram, as well as around the ribs, is identical to that found on the Museum&#x27;s Amati violin made at about the same time and may relate to the court of King Philip II of Spain. The loss of some of the mottoes&#x27; text, as well as other decorative elements painted on the back, clearly reveals that this instrument was reduced in both length and width from its original, large tenor dimensions.

Northern Italian viola attributed to Andrea Amati. Made, in our opinion, circa 1620 by a member of the Amati school. The head by another maker. The back is from one piece of slab cut maple with faint irregular flames. The sides are from slab cut maple similar to the back. The scroll is from quarter cut maple with faint narrow flames. The top is from two pieces of spruce with medium and narrow grain. The dimensions are somewhat reduced. The varnish has a golden brown color. Labelled &quot;ANDREAS AMATIUS CREMONA 1567&quot;.

This instrument was cut down in size around 1800 from an original length of about 47¬†cm. The ribs are painted with the inscription: &quot;Non AEtesin Homine sed Virtus Consideramus&quot;.

Although the instrument comes with a certificate from Simone F. Sacconi attributing it to the Brothers Amati circa 1620, both Charles Beare and Jacques Francais believe it to be a work of Andrea Amati, possibly completed by the Brothers Amati, in which case its date would be closer to 1580.

====Held by the Royal Academy of Music London ca 1620====

Antonio &amp; Girolamo Amati ca 1620

One of the few surviving tenors which has not been reduced in size for modern playing. The head is particularly beautiful and well proportioned. The cheeks are flat, in the style of a cello head, although not so wide as to obstruct the player&#x27;s left hand. The long and elegant pegbox tapers to a wide throat beneath the perfectly carved scroll. The volutes are hollowed and gather depth from the second through to the narrow final turn. The figured quarter-sawn maple used for the back and sides of the instrument is of a type commonly used by the Amatis. The continuous slope of the flame across the centre joint (achieved by reversing one half of the back before jointing), rather than the mirror-image pattern most commonly seen, is also a feature of their work. The front is of straight and even close-grained spruce.

<doc id="1695" wikidata="Q134154" url="?curid=1695" title="Amazons">
<text>The Amazons (Ancient Greek: &#x27;, singular&#x27;; in Latin &#x27;,&#x27;) were a people in Greek mythology, portrayed in a number of ancient epic poems and legends, such as the Labours of Heracles, the &quot;Argonautica&quot; and the &quot;Iliad&quot;. They were female warriors and hunters, known for their physical agility, strength, archery, riding skills, and the arts of combat. Their society was closed to men and they raised only their daughters and returned their sons to their fathers, with whom they would only socialize briefly in order to reproduce.

Courageous and fiercely independent, the Amazons, commanded by their queen, regularly undertook extensive military expeditions into the far corners of the world, from Scythia to Thrace, Asia Minor and the Aegean Islands, reaching as far as Arabia and Egypt. Besides military raids, the Amazons are also associated with the foundation of temples and the establishment of numerous ancient cities like Ephesos, Cyme, Smyrna, Sinope, Myrina, Magnesia, Pygela, etc.

The texts of the original myths envisioned the homeland of the Amazons at the periphery of the then-known world. Various claims to the exact place ranged from provinces in Asia Minor (Lycia, Caria, etc.) to the steppes around the Black Sea, or even Libya (Libyan Amazon). However, authors most frequently referred to Pontus in northern Anatolia, on the southern shores of the Black Sea, as the independent Amazon kingdom where the Amazon queen resided at her capital Themiscyra, on the banks of the Thermodon river.

Decades of archaeological discoveries of burial sites of female warriors, including royalty, in the Eurasian Steppes suggest that the horse cultures of the Scythian, Sarmatian and Hittite peoples likely inspired the Amazon myth. In 2019, a grave with multiple generations of female Scythian warriors, armed and in golden headdresses, was found near Voronezh in southwestern Russia.

==Name==
===Etymology===

The origin of the word is uncertain. It may be derived from an Iranian ethnonym &quot;*ha-mazan-&quot; &#x27;warriors&#x27;, a word attested indirectly through a derivation, a denominal verb in Hesychius of Alexandria&#x27;s gloss (&quot;&quot;&quot;: &#x27;to make war&#x27; in Persian&quot;), where it appears together with the Indo-Iranian root &quot;*kar-&quot; &#x27;make&#x27;.

It may alternatively be a Greek word descended from &#x27;manless, without husbands&#x27; (alpha privative combined with a derivation from &quot;*man-&quot; cognate with Proto-Balto-Slavic &quot;&quot;, found in Czech &quot;mu≈æ&quot;) has been proposed, an explanation deemed &quot;unlikely&quot; by Hjalmar Frisk. A further explanation proposes Iranian *&quot;ama-janah&quot; &#x27;virility-killing&#x27; as source.

Among the ancient Greeks, the term &quot;Amazon&quot; was popularly folk etymologized as originating from the Greek , &#x27; (&#x27;breastless&#x27;), from -&quot;a&quot; (&#x27;without&#x27;) and &#x27;, a variant of &quot;&quot; (&#x27;breast&#x27;), connected with an etiological tradition once claimed by Marcus Justinus who alleged that Amazons had their right breast cut off or burnt out. There is no indication of such a practice in ancient works of art, in which the Amazons are always represented with both breasts, although one is frequently covered. According to Philostratus, Amazon babies were not fed just with the right breast. Author Adrienne Mayor suggests that the false etymology led to the myth.

===Alternative terms===
Herodotus used the terms &quot;Androktones&quot; () &#x27;killers/slayers of men&#x27; or &#x27;of husbands&#x27; and &quot;Androleteirai&quot; () &#x27;destroyers of men, murderesses&#x27;. Amazons are called &quot;Antianeirai&quot; () &#x27;equivalent to men&#x27; and Aeschylus used the term &quot;Styganor&quot; () &#x27;those who loathe all men&#x27;.

In his work &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; and in &quot;The Suppliants&quot;, Aeschylus referred to the Amazons as &#x27;the unwed, flesh-devouring Amazons&#x27; (). In the Hippolytus tragedy, Phaedra calls Hippolytus, &#x27;the son of the horse-loving Amazon&#x27; (). In his Dionysiaca, Nonnus calls the Amazons of Dionysus &quot;Androphonus&quot; () &#x27;men slaying&#x27;.
Herodotus stated that in the Scythian language, the Amazons were called &quot;Oiorpata&quot;, which he explained as being from &quot;oior&quot; &#x27;man&#x27; and &quot;pata&quot; &#x27;to slay&#x27;.

== Historiography ==

The ancient Greeks never had any doubts that the Amazons were, or had been, real. Not the only people enchanted by warlike women of nomadic cultures, such exciting tales also come from ancient Egypt, Persia, India, and China. Greek heroes of old had encounters with the queens of their martial society and fought them. However, their original home was not exactly known, thought to be in the obscure lands beyond the civilized world. As a result, many classical scholars consider Amazons to be entirely fictional figures, invented by Greek men to serve as ‚Äúanti-women‚Äù or to symbolize Persians. Some authors preferred comparisons to cultures of Asia Minor or even Minoan Crete. The most obvious historical candidates are Lycia and Scythia and Sarmatia in line with the account by Herodotus. In his Histories (5th century BC) Herodotus claims that the &quot;Sauromatae&quot; (predecessors of the Sarmatians), who ruled the lands between the Caspian Sea and the Black Sea, arose from a union of Scythians and Amazons.

Herodotus also observed rather unusual customs among the Lycians of southwest Asia Minor. The Lycians obviously followed matrilineal rules of descent, virtue, and status. They named themselves along their maternal family line and a child&#x27;s status was determined by the mother&#x27;s reputation. This remarkably high esteem of women and legal regulations based on maternal lines, still in effect in the 5th century BC in the Lycian regions that Herodotus had traveled to, suggested to him the idea that these people were descendants of the mythical Amazons.

Modern historiography no longer relies exclusively on textual and artistic material, but also on the vast archaeological evidence of over a thousand nomad graves from steppe territories from the Black Sea all the way to Mongolia. Discoveries of battle-scarred female skeletons buried with their weapons (bows and arrows, quivers, and spears) prove that women warriors were not merely figments of imagination, but the product of the Scythian and Sarmatian horse-centered lifestyle, however it is not known if these people were the inspiration for the Amazons of Greek mythology.

== Mythology ==

According to myth, Otrera, the first Amazon queen, is the offspring of a romance between Ares the god of war and the nymph Harmonia of the Akmonian Wood, and as such a demigoddess.

Early records refer to two events in which Amazons appeared prior to the Trojan War (before 1250 BC). Within the epic context, Bellerophon, Greek hero, and grandfather of the brothers and Trojan War veterans &quot;Glaukos and Sarpedon&quot;, faced Amazons during his stay in Lycia, when King Iobates sent Bellerophon to fight the Amazons, hoping they would kill him, yet Bellerophon slew them all. The youthful King Priam of Troy fought on the side of the Phrygians, who were attacked by Amazons at the Sangarios River.

===Amazons in the Trojan War===
There are Amazon characters in Homer&#x27;s Trojan War epic poem, the &quot;Iliad&quot;, one of the oldest surviving texts in Europe (around 8th century BC).
The now lost epic &quot;Aethiopis&quot; (probably by Arctinus of Miletus, 6th century BC), like the &quot;Iliad&quot; and several other epics, is one of the works that in combination form the Trojan War Epic Cycle. In one of the few references to the text, an Amazon force under queen Penthesilea, who was of Thracian birth, came to join the ranks of the Trojans after Hector&#x27;s death and initially put the Greeks under serious pressure. Only after the greatest effort and the help of the reinvigorated hero Achilles, the Greeks eventually triumphed. Penthesilea died fighting the mighty Achilles in single combat. Homer himself deemed the Amazon myths to be common knowledge all over Greece, which suggests that they had already been known for some time before him. He was also convinced that the Amazons lived not at its fringes, but somewhere in or around Lycia in Asia Minor - a place well within the Greek world.

Troy is mentioned in the &quot;Iliad&quot; as the place of Myrine&#x27;s death. Later identified as an Amazon queen, according to Diodorus (1st century BC), the Amazons under her rule invaded the territories of the Atlantians, defeated the army of the Atlantian city of Cerne, and razed the city to the ground.

===In Scythia===
The Poet Bacchylides (6th century BC) and the historian Herodotus (5th century BC) located the Amazon homeland in &quot;Pontus&quot; at the southern shores of the Black Sea, and the capital Themiscyra at the banks of the Thermodon (modern Terme river), by the modern city of Terme. Herodotus also explains how it came to be that some Amazons would eventually be living in Scythia. A Greek fleet, sailing home upon defeating the Amazons in battle at the Thermodon river, included three ships crowded with Amazon prisoners. Once out at sea, the Amazon prisoners overwhelmed and killed the small crews of the prisoner ships and, despite not having even basic navigation skills, managed to escape and safely disembark at the Scythian shore. As soon as the Amazons had caught enough horses, they easily asserted themselves in the steppe in between the Caspian Sea and the Black Sea and, according to Herodotus, would eventually assimilate with the Scythians, whose descendants were the Sauromatae, the predecessors of the Sarmatians.

===Amazon homeland===
Strabo (1st century BC) visits and confirms the original homeland of the Amazons on the plains by the Thermodon river. However, long gone and not seen again during his lifetime, the Amazons had allegedly retreated into the mountains. Strabo, however, added that other authors, among them Metrodorus of Scepsis and Hypsicrates claim that after abandoning Themiscyra, the Amazons had chosen to resettle beyond the borders of the Gargareans, an all-male tribe native to the northern foothills of the Caucasian Mountains. The Amazons and Gargareans had for many generations met in secrecy once a year during two months in spring, in order to produce children. These encounters would take place in accordance with ancient tribal customs and collective offers of sacrifices. All females were retained by the Amazons themselves, and males were returned to the Gargareans. 5th century BC poet Magnes sings of the bravery of the Lydians in a cavalry-battle against the Amazons.

===Heracles myth===

Hippolyte was an Amazon queen killed by Heracles, who had set out to obtain the queen&#x27;s magic belt in a task he was to accomplish as one of the Labours of Heracles. Although neither side had intended to resort to lethal combat, a misunderstanding led to the fight. In the course of this, Heracles killed the queen and several other Amazons. In awe of the strong hero, the Amazons eventually handed the belt to Heracles. In another version, Heracles does not kill the queen, but exchanges her kidnapped sister Melanippe for the belt.

===Theseus myth===
Queen Hippolyte was abducted by Theseus, who took her to Athens, where she was married to him and bore him a son, Hippolytus. In other versions, the kidnapped Amazon is called Antiope, the sister of Hippolyte. In revenge, the Amazons invaded Greece, plundered some cities along the coast of Attica, and besieged and occupied Athens. Hippolyte, who fought on the side of Athens, according to another account was killed during the final battle along with all of the Amazons.

===Amazons and Dionysus===
According to Plutarch, the god Dionysus and his companions fought Amazons at Ephesus. The Amazons fled to Samos and Dionysus pursued them and killed a great number of them at a site since called &quot;Panaema&quot; (blood-soaked field). The Christian author Eusebius writes that during the reign of Oxyntes, one of the mythical kings of Athens, the Amazons burned down the temple at Ephesus.

In another myth Dionysus unites with the Amazons to fight against Cronus and the Titans. Polyaenus writes that after Dionysus has subdued the Indians, he allies with them and the Amazons and takes them into his service, who serve him in his campaign against the Bactrians. Nonnus in his &quot;Dionysiaca&quot; reports about the Amazons of Dionysus, but states that they do not come from Thermodon.

===Amazons and Alexander the Great===

Amazons are also mentioned by biographers of Alexander the Great, who report of Queen Thalestris bearing him a child (a story in the &quot;Alexander Romance&quot;). However, other biographers of Alexander dispute the claim, including the highly regarded Plutarch. He noted a moment when Alexander&#x27;s naval commander Onesicritus read an Amazon myth passage of his &quot;Alexander History&quot; to King Lysimachus of Thrace who had taken part in the original expedition. The king smiled at him and said: &quot;And where was I, then?&quot;

The Talmud recounts that Alexander wanted to conquer a &quot;kingdom of women&quot; but reconsidered when the women told him: 

===Roman and ancient Egyptian records===

Virgil&#x27;s characterization of the Volsci warrior maiden Camilla in the &quot;Aeneid&quot; borrows from the myths of the Amazons. Philostratus, in &quot;Heroica&quot;, writes that the Mysian women fought on horses alongside the men, just as the Amazons. The leader was Hiera, wife of Telephus. The Amazons are also said to have undertaken an expedition against the Island of Leuke, at the mouth of the Danube, where the ashes of Achilles were deposited by Thetis. The ghost of the dead hero so terrified the horses, that they threw off and trampled upon the invaders, who were forced to retreat. Virgil touches on the Amazons and their queen Penthesilea in his epic Aeneid (around 20 BC).

The biographer Suetonius had Julius Caesar remark in his &quot;De vita Caesarum&quot; that the Amazons &quot;once ruled a large part of Asia&quot;. Appian provides a vivid description of Themiscyra and its fortifications in his account of Lucius Licinius Lucullus&#x27; &quot;Siege of Themiscyra&quot; in 71 BC during the Third Mithridatic War.

An Amazon myth has been partly preserved in two badly fragmented versions around historical people in 7th century BC Egypt. The Egyptian prince &quot;Petechonsis&quot; and allied Assyrian troops undertook a joint campaign into the &quot;Land of Women&quot;, to the &quot;Middle East&quot; at the border to India. &quot;Petechonsis&quot; initially fought the Amazons, but soon fell in love with their queen &quot;Sarpot&quot; and eventually allied with her against an invading Indian army. This story is said to have originated in Egypt independently of Greek influences.

===Amazon queens===
Sources provide names of individual Amazons, that are referred to as queens of their people, even as the head of a dynasty. Without a male companion, they are portrayed in command of their female warriors. Among the most prominent Amazon queens were:

* Otrera, daughter of the nymph Harmonia and god of war, Ares. She is the mother of Hippolyta, Antiope, Melanippe, and Penthesilea and the mythical founder of the Temple of Artemis in Ephesus.
*Hippolyta, daughter of Otrera and Ares. She is part of the Theseus and Heracles myths, in which Antiope is her sister. Alcippe, the only Amazon known to have sworn a chastity oath, belongs to her entourage.
* Penthesilea, who kills her sister Hippolyte in a hunting accident, comes to the aid of the hard-pressed Trojans with her warriors, is defeated by Achilles, who mourns her.
* Lampedo and Marpesia, queens of the Amazons mentioned by Justin
* Myrina, who leads a military expedition in Libya, defeats the Atlanteans, forms an alliance with the ruler of Egypt, and conquers numerous cities and islands.
* Thalestris, the last known Amazon queen. According to legend, she meets the Greek conqueror Alexander the Great in 330 BC. Her home is the Thermodon region, or, variably, the Gates of Alexander, south of the Caspian Sea.

== Various authors and chroniclers ==
===Quintus Smyrnaeus===
Quintus Smyrnaeus, author of the Posthomerica lists the attendant warriors of Penthesilea: &quot;Clonie was there, Polemusa, Derinoe, Evandre, and Antandre, and Bremusa, Hippothoe, dark-eyed Harmothoe, Alcibie, Derimacheia, Antibrote, and Thermodosa glorying with the spear.&quot;

===Diodorus Siculus===
Diodorus Siculus lists twelve Amazons who challenged and died fighting Heracles during his quest for Hippolyta&#x27;s girdle: Aella, Philippis, Prothoe, Eriboea, Celaeno, Eurybia, Phoebe, Deianeira, Asteria, Marpe, Tecmessa, and Alcippe. After Alcippe&#x27;s death, a group attack followed. Diodorus also mentions Melanippe, whom Heracles set free after accepting her girdle and Antiope as ransom.

Diodorus lists another group with Myrina as the queen who commanded the Amazons in a military expedition in Libya, as well as her sister Mytilene, after whom she named the city of the same name. Myrina also named three more cities after the Amazons who held the most important commands under her, Cyme, Pitane, and Priene.

===Justin and Paulus Orosius===
Both Justin in his &quot;Epitome of Trogus Pompeius&quot; and Paulus Orosius give an account of the Amazons, citing the same names. Queens Marpesia and Lampedo shared the power during an incursion in Europe and Asia, where they were slain. Marpesia&#x27;s daughter Orithyia succeeded them and was greatly admired for her skill on war. She shared power with her sister Antiope, but she was engaged in war abroad when Heracles attacked. Two of Antiope&#x27;s sisters were taken prisoner, Melanippe by Heracles and Hippolyta by Theseus. Heracles latter restored Melanippe to her sister after receiving the queen&#x27;s arms in exchange, though, on other accounts she was killed by Telamon. They also mention Penthesilea&#x27;s role in the Trojan War.

===Hyginus===
Another list of Amazons&#x27; names is found in Hyginus&#x27; &quot;Fabulae&quot;. Along with Hippolyta, Otrera, Antiope and Penthesilea, it attests the following names: Ocyale, Dioxippe, Iphinome, Xanthe, Hippothoe, Laomache, Glauce, Agave, Theseis, Clymene, Polydora.

Perhaps the most important is Queen Otrera, consort of Ares and mother by him of Hippolyta and Penthesilea. She is also known for building a temple to Artemis at Ephesus.

===Valerius Flaccus===
Another different set of names is found in Valerius Flaccus&#x27; &quot;Argonautica&quot;. He mentions Euryale, Harpe, Lyce, Menippe and Thoe. Of these Lyce also appears on a fragment, preserved in the &quot;Latin Anthology&quot; where she is said to have killed the hero Clonus of Moesia, son of Doryclus, with her javelin.

===Palaephatus===
Palaephatus, who himself might have been a fictional character, attempted to rationalize the Greek myths in his work &quot;On Unbelievable Tales&quot;. He suspected that the Amazons were probably men who were mistaken for women by their enemies because they wore clothing that reached their feet, tied up their hair in headbands, and shaved their beards. Probably the first in a long line of skeptics, he rejected any real basis for them, reasoning that because they did not exist during his time, most probably they did not exist in the past either. He himself contradicted this in his rationalizing of Oedipus and the Sphinx, portraying the latter as an Amazon woman named &quot;Sphinx.&quot;

== Late Antiquity, Middle Age and Renaissance literature ==
Stephanus of Byzantium (7th-century CE) provides numerous alternative lists of the Amazons, including for those who died in combat against Heracles, describing them as the &quot;most prominent of their people&quot;. Both Stephanus and Eustathius connect these Amazons with the placename &quot;Thibais&quot;, which they claim to have been derived from the Amazon &quot;Thiba&#x27;s&quot; name. Several of Stephanus&#x27; Amazons served as eponyms for cities in Asia Minor, like &quot;Cyme&quot; and &quot;Smyrna&quot; or &quot;Amastris&quot;, who was believed to lend her name to the city previously known as &quot;Kromna&quot;, although in fact it was named after the historical Amastris. The city Anaea in Caria was named after an Amazon.

In his work &quot;Getica&quot; (on the origin and history of the Goths, ) Jordanes asserts that the Goths&#x27; ancestors, descendants of Magog, originally lived in Scythia, at the Sea of Azov between the Dnieper and Don Rivers. When the Goths were abroad campaigning against Pharaoh Vesosis, their women, on their own successfully fended off a raid by a neighboring tribe. Emboldened, the women established their own army under Marpesia, crossed the Don and invaded eastward into Asia. Marpesia&#x27;s sister Lampedo remained in Europe to guard the homeland. They procreated with men once a year. These women conquered Armenia, Syria and all of Asia Minor, even reaching Ionia and Aeolis, holding this vast territory for 100 years.

In &quot;Digenes Akritas&quot;, the twelfth century medieval epic of &quot;Basil, the Greco-Syrian knight&quot; of the Byzantine frontier, the hero battles and then commits adultery with the female warrior Maximo (killing her afterwards in one version of the epic), descended from some Amazons and taken by Alexander from the Brahmans.

John Tzetzes lists in &quot;Posthomerica&quot; twenty Amazons, who fell at Troy. This list is unique in its attestation for all the names but Antianeira, Andromache and Hippothoe. Other than these three, the remaining 17 Amazons were named as Toxophone, Toxoanassa, Gortyessa, Iodoce, Pharetre, Andro, Ioxeia, Oistrophe, Androdaixa, Aspidocharme, Enchesimargos, Cnemis, Thorece, Chalcaor, Eurylophe, Hecate, and Anchimache.

Famous medieval traveller John Mandeville mentions them in his book:

Medieval and Renaissance authors credit the Amazons with the invention of the battle-axe. This is probably related to the &quot;sagaris&quot;, an axe-like weapon associated with both Amazons and Scythian tribes by Greek authors (see also Thracian tomb of Aleksandrovo kurgan). Paulus Hector Mair expresses astonishment that such a &quot;manly weapon&quot; should have been invented by a &quot;tribe of women&quot;, but he accepts the attribution out of respect for his authority, Johannes Aventinus.

Ariosto&#x27;s &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot; contains a country of warrior women, ruled by Queen Orontea; the epic describes an origin much like that in Greek myth, in that the women, abandoned by a band of warriors and unfaithful lovers, rallied together to form a nation from which men were severely reduced, to prevent them from regaining power. The Amazons and Queen Hippolyta are also referenced in Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; in &quot;The Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot;.

Amazons continued to be subject of scholarly debate during the European Renaissance, and with the onset of the Age of Exploration, encounters were reported from ever more distant lands. In 1542, Francisco de Orellana reached the Amazon River, naming it after the &quot;&quot;, a tribe of warlike women he claimed to have encountered and fought on the Nhamund√° River, a tributary of the Amazon. Afterwards the whole basin and region of the Amazon (&quot;Amaz√¥nia&quot; in Portuguese, &quot;Amazon√≠a&quot; in Spanish) were named after the river. Amazons also figure in the accounts of both Christopher Columbus and Walter Raleigh.

== Amazons in art ==

Beginning around 550 BC. depictions of Amazons as daring fighters and equestrian warriors appeared on vases. After the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC the &quot;Amazon battle - Amazonomachy&quot; became popular motifs on pottery. By the sixth century BC, public and privately displayed artwork used the Amazon imagery for pediment reliefs, sarcophagi, mosaics, pottery, jewelry and even monumental sculptures, that adorned important buildings like the Parthenon in Athens. Amazon motifs remained popular until the Roman imperial period and into Late antiquity.

Apart from the artistic desire to express the passionate womanhood of the Amazons in contrast with the manhood of their enemies, some modern historians interpret the popularity of Amazon in art as indicators of societal trends, both positive and negative. Greek and Roman societies, however, utilized the Amazon mythology as a literary and artistic vehicle to unite against a commonly-held enemy. The metaphysical characteristics of Amazons were seen as personifications of both nature and religion. Roman authors like Virgil, Strabo, Pliny the Elder, Curtius, Plutarch, Arrian, and Pausanius advocated the greatness of the state, as Amazon myths served to discuss the creation of origin and identity for the Roman people. However, that changed over time. Amazons in Roman literature and art have many faces, such as the &quot;Trojan ally, the warrior goddess, the native Latin, the warmongering Celt, the proud Sarmatian, the hedonistic and passionate Thracian warrior queen, the subdued Asian city, and the worthy Roman foe&quot;.

In Renaissance Europe, artists started to reevaluate and depict Amazons based on Christian ethics. Queen Elizabeth of England was associated with Amazon warrior qualities (&quot;the foremost ancient examples of feminism&quot;) during her reign and was indeed depicted as such. Though, as explained in &quot;Divina Virago&quot; by Winfried Schleiner, Celeste T. Wright has given a detailed account of the bad reputation Amazons had in the Renaissance. She notes that she has not found any Elizabethans comparing the Queen to an Amazon and suggests that they might have hesitated to do so because of the association of Amazons with enfranchisement of women, which was considered contemptible. Elizabeth was present at a tournament celebrating the marriage of the Earl of Warwick and Anne Russell at Westminster Palace on 11 November 1565 involving male riders dressed as Amazons. They accompanied the challengers carrying their heraldry. These riders wore crimson gowns, masks with long hair attached, and swords.

Peter Paul Rubens and Jan Brueghel depicted the Battle of the Amazons around 1598, a &quot;most dramatic baroque painting&quot;, followed by a painting of the Rococo period by Johann Georg Platzer, also titled &quot;Battle of the Amazons&quot;. In 19th-century European Romanticism German artist Anselm Feuerbach occupied himself with the Amazons as well. Of Faeurbach&#x27;s painting, Gert Schiff wrote that: It engendered all the aspirations of the Romantics: their desire to transcend the boundaries of the ego and of the known world; their interest in the occult in nature and in the soul; their search for a national identity, and the ensuing search for the mythic origins of the Germanic nation; finally, their wish to escape the harsh realities of the present through immersion in an idealized past.

== Maps ==
On medieval Borgia Velletri map picture of females with bow and arrow and with spear and shield with description &quot;The land formerly of illustrious women&quot; of place North (on the bottom) on &quot;Edilus fluuius maximus&quot; (Volga).

In medieval Fra Mauro map country placed on the Middle Volga.

==Archaeology==
Speculation that the idea of Amazons contains a core of reality is based on archaeological discoveries at kurgan burial sites in the steppes of southern Ukraine and Russia. The varied war weapons artifacts found in graves of numerous high-ranking Scythian and Sarmatian warrior women have led scholars to conclude that the Amazonian legend has been inspired by the real world: About 20% of the warrior graves on the lower Don and lower Volga contained women dressed for battle similar to how men dress. Armed women accounted for up to 25% of Sarmatian military burials. Russian archaeologist Vera Kovalevskaya asserts that when Scythian men were abroad fighting or hunting, women would have to be able to competently defend themselves, their animals, and their pastures.

In early 20th century Minoan archeology, a theory regarding Amazon origins in Minoan civilization was raised in an essay by Lewis Richard Farnell and John Myres. According to Myres, the tradition interpreted in the light of evidence furnished by supposed Amazon cults seems to have been very similar and may have even originated in Minoan culture.

==Modern legacy==
The city of Samsun in modern-day Samsun Province, Turkey features an &quot;Amazon Village&quot; museum, to help bring attention to the legacy of the Amazons and to promote both academic interest and tourism. An annual &quot;Amazon Celebration Festival&quot; takes place in the Terme district.

During the Ottoman‚ÄìEgyptian invasion of Mani in 1826, in the battle of Diros the women of Mani defeated the Ottoman army and for this were given the name of &#x27;The Amazons of Diros&#x27;.

From 1936 to 1939, annual propaganda events, called Night of the Amazons (&quot;Nacht der Amazonen&quot;) were performed in Nazi Germany at the Nymphenburg Palace Park in Munich. Announced as evening highlights of the &quot;International Horse Racing Week Munich-Riem&quot;, bare-breasted variety show girls of the SS-Cavalry, 2,500 participants and international guests performed at the open-air revue. These revues served to promote an allegedly emancipated female role and a cosmopolitan and foreigner-friendly Nazi regime.

===Military units===

* Russian general and statesman Grigory Potemkin, and then favourite of Catherine the Great created an Amazons Company in 1787. Wives and daughters of the soldiers of the Greek Battalion of Balaklava were enlisted and formed this unit.
* The Mino, or Minon, (&quot;Our Mothers&quot;) were a late 19th to early 20th-century all-female official military regiment of the former Kingdom of Dahomey (present-day Benin). Since the early 18th-century women contingents had already joined the army, usually during deployment, in order to inflate the army size. However, women proved themselves courageous and effective in active combat, and a regular unit was established. Western observers, who had allegedly perceived certain Amazon-like physical and mental qualities in these women, came up with the trivial epithet Dahomey Amazons.

===Social and religious activism===
* During the period 1905‚Äì1913, members of the militant Suffragette movement were frequently referred to as &quot;Amazons&quot; in books and newspaper articles.
* In Ukraine Katerina Tarnovska leads a group called the Asgarda which claims to be a new tribe of Amazons.

<text>Ambergris ( or ; ; ), ambergrease, or grey amber is a solid, waxy, flammable substance of a dull grey or blackish colour produced in the digestive system of sperm whales. Freshly produced ambergris has a marine, fecal odor. It acquires a sweet, earthy scent as it ages, commonly likened to the fragrance of isopropyl alcohol without the vaporous chemical astringency.

Ambergris has been highly valued by perfume makers as a fixative that allows the scent to last much longer, although it has been mostly replaced by synthetic ambroxide. It is sometimes used in cooking.

Dogs are attracted to the smell of ambergris and are sometimes used by ambergris searchers.

==Etymology==
The English word &quot;amber&quot; derives from Middle Persian , traveling via Arabic (), Middle Latin &quot;ambar,&quot; and Middle French &quot;ambre&quot; to be adopted in Middle English in the 14th century.

The word &quot;ambergris&quot; comes from the Old French &quot;ambre gris&quot; or &quot;grey amber&quot;. The addition of &quot;grey&quot; came about when, in the Romance languages, the sense of the word &quot;amber&quot; was extended to Baltic amber (fossil resin), as white or yellow amber (&quot;ambre jaune&quot;), from as early as the late 13th century. This fossilized resin subsequently became the dominant (and now exclusive) sense of &quot;amber&quot;, leaving &quot;ambergris&quot; as the word for the whale secretion.

The archaic alternate spelling &quot;ambergrease&quot; arose as an eggcorn from the phonetic pronunciation of &quot;ambergris,&quot; encouraged by the substance&#x27;s waxy texture.

==Formation==
Ambergris is formed from a secretion of the bile duct in the intestines of the sperm whale, and can be found floating on the sea or washed up on coastlines. It is sometimes found in the abdomens of dead sperm whales. Because the beaks of giant squids have been discovered within lumps of ambergris, scientists have hypothesized that the substance is produced by the whale&#x27;s gastrointestinal tract to ease the passage of hard, sharp objects that it may have eaten.

Ambergris is passed like fecal matter. It is speculated that an ambergris mass too large to be passed through the intestines is expelled via the mouth, but this remains under debate. Another theory states that an ambergris mass is formed when the colon of a whale is enlarged by a blockage from intestinal worms and cephalopod parts resulting in the death of the whale and the mass being excreted into the sea. Ambergris takes years to form. Christopher Kemp, the author of &quot;Floating Gold: A Natural (and Unnatural) History of Ambergris&quot;, says that it is only produced by sperm whales, and only by an estimated one percent of them. Ambergris is rare; once expelled by a whale, it often floats for years before making landfall. The slim chances of finding ambergris and the legal ambiguity involved led perfume makers away from ambergris, and led chemists on a quest to find viable alternatives.

Ambergris is found primarily in the Atlantic Ocean and on the coasts of South Africa; Brazil; Madagascar; the East Indies; The Maldives; China; Japan; India; Australia; New Zealand; and the Molucca Islands. Most commercially collected ambergris comes from the Bahamas in the Atlantic, particularly New Providence. In 2021, fishermen found a 127 kg (280-pound) piece of ambergris off the coast of Yemen, valued at US$1.5 million. Fossilised ambergris from 1.75 million years ago has also been found.

==Physical properties==
Ambergris is found in lumps of various shapes and sizes, usually weighing from to or more. When initially expelled by or removed from the whale, the fatty precursor of ambergris is pale white in color (sometimes streaked with black), soft, with a strong fecal smell. Following months to years of photodegradation and oxidation in the ocean, this precursor gradually hardens, developing a dark grey or black color, a crusty and waxy texture, and a peculiar odor that is at once sweet, earthy, marine, and animalic. Its scent has been generally described as a vastly richer and smoother version of isopropanol without its stinging harshness. In this developed condition, ambergris has a specific gravity ranging from 0.780 to 0.926 (meaning it floats in water). It melts at about to a fatty, yellow resinous liquid; and at it is volatilised into a white vapor. It is soluble in ether, and in volatile and fixed oils.

==Chemical properties==
Ambergris is relatively nonreactive to acid. White crystals of a terpenoid known as ambrein, discovered by Leopold Ru≈æiƒçka and Fernand Lardon in 1946, can be separated from ambergris by heating raw ambergris in alcohol, then allowing the resulting solution to cool. Breakdown of the relatively scentless ambrein through oxidation produces ambroxide and ambrinol, the main odor components of ambergris.

Ambroxide is now produced synthetically and used extensively in the perfume industry.

==Applications==
Ambergris has been mostly known for its use in creating perfume and fragrance much like musk. Perfumes based on ambergris still exist.
Ambergris has historically been used in food and drink. A serving of eggs and ambergris was reportedly King Charles II of England&#x27;s favorite dish. A recipe for Rum Shrub liqueur from the mid 19th century called for a thread of ambergris to be added to rum, almonds, cloves, cassia, and the peel of oranges in making a cocktail from &quot;The English and Australian Cookery Book&quot;. It has been used as a flavoring agent in Turkish coffee and in hot chocolate in 18th century Europe. The substance is considered an aphrodisiac in some cultures.

Ancient Egyptians burned ambergris as incense, while in modern Egypt ambergris is used for scenting cigarettes. The ancient Chinese called the substance &quot;dragon&#x27;s spittle fragrance&quot;. During the Black Death in Europe, people believed that carrying a ball of ambergris could help prevent them from contracting plague. This was because the fragrance covered the smell of the air which was believed to be a cause of plague.

During the Middle Ages, Europeans used ambergris as a medication for headaches, colds, epilepsy, and other ailments.

==Legality==

From the 18th to the mid-19th century, the whaling industry prospered. By some reports, nearly 50,000 whales, including sperm whales, were killed each year. Throughout the 19th century, &quot;millions of whales were killed for their oil, whalebone, and ambergris&quot; to fuel profits, and they soon became endangered as a species as a result. Due to studies showing that the whale populations were being threatened, the International Whaling Commission instituted a moratorium on commercial whaling in 1982. Although ambergris is not harvested from whales, many countries also ban the trade of ambergris as part of the more general ban on the hunting and exploitation of whales.

Urine, faeces, and ambergris (that has been naturally excreted by a sperm whale) are waste products not considered parts or derivatives of a CITES species and are therefore not covered by the provisions of the convention.

Countries where ambergris trade is illegal include:
* Australia ‚Äì Under federal law, the export and import of ambergris for commercial purposes is banned by the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The various states and territories have additional laws regarding ambergris.
* United States ‚Äì The possession and trade of ambergris is prohibited by the Endangered Species Act of 1973.
* India ‚Äì Sale or possession is illegal under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.

Countries where trade of ambergris is legal include:
* United Kingdom
* France
* Switzerland
* Maldives

<text>Ambiorix (Gaulish &quot;king of the surroundings&quot;, or &quot;king-protector&quot;) ( 54‚Äì53 BC) was, together with Cativolcus, prince of the Eburones, leader of a Belgic tribe of north-eastern Gaul (Gallia Belgica), where modern Belgium is located. In the nineteenth century Ambiorix became a Belgian national hero because of his resistance against Julius Caesar, as written in Caesar&#x27;s &quot;Commentarii de Bello Gallico&quot;.

== Name ==
It is generally accepted that &quot;Ambiorix&quot; is a Gaulish personal name formed with the prefix &quot;ambio-&quot; attached to &quot;rix&quot; (&#x27;king&#x27;), but the meaning of the first element is debated. Some scholars translate &quot;Ambiorix&quot; as the &#x27;king of the surroundings&#x27; or &#x27;king of the enclosure&#x27;, by interpreting &quot;ambio-&quot; as a thematized form of &quot;ambi-&quot; (&#x27;around, on both sides&#x27;) meaning &#x27;surroundings&#x27; or else &#x27;enclosure&#x27; (cf. Old Irish &quot;imbe&quot; &#x27;enclosure&#x27;). Alternatively, Fredrik Otto Lindeman renders &quot;Ambiorix&quot; as the &#x27;protector-king&#x27;, by deriving &quot;ambio-&quot; from the Proto-Indo-European compound (&#x27;protector&#x27;; cf. Old Indic &quot;adhi-p√°-&quot; &#x27;protector, ruler, master, king&#x27;).

== Biography ==

===Early history===
In 57 BCE, Julius Caesar conquered parts of Gaul and also Belgica (Belgium, modern-day Northern France, Luxembourg, part of present-day Netherlands below the Rhine River; and the north-western portion of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany). There were several tribes in the country who fought against each other frequently. The Eburones were ruled by Ambiorix and Catuvolcus. In 54 BCE, Caesar&#x27;s troops urgently needed more food, and so the local tribes were forced to give up part of their harvest, which had not been good that year. Understandably, the starving Eburones were reluctant to do so and Caesar ordered that camps be built near the Eburones&#x27; villages. Each centurion was ordered to make sure the food supplies were delivered to the Roman soldiers. This created resentment among the Eburones.

Although Julius Caesar had freed him from paying tribute to the Atuatuci, Ambiorix joined Catuvolcus in the winter of 54 BCE in an uprising against the Roman forces under Quintus Titurius Sabinus and Lucius Aurunculeius Cotta.

===Resisting the Romans===
Because a drought had disrupted his grain supply, Caesar was forced to winter his legions among the rebellious Belgic tribes. Roman troops led by Sabinus and Cotta were wintering among the Eburones when they were attacked by them, led by Ambiorix and Cativolcus. Ambiorix deceived the Romans, telling them the attack was made without his consent, and further advised them to flee as a large Germanic force was preparing to cross the Rhine. Trusting Ambiorix, Sabinus and Cotta&#x27;s troops left the next morning. A short distance from their camp, the Roman troops were ambushed by the Eburones and massacred.

Elsewhere, another Roman force under Quintus Tullius Cicero, younger brother of the orator Marcus, were wintering amongst the Nervii. Leading a coalition of rebellious Belgic tribes, Ambiorix surrounded Cicero&#x27;s camp. After a long while, a Roman messenger was finally able to slip through the Belgic lines and get word of the uprising to Caesar. Mobilizing his legions, Caesar immediately marched to Cicero&#x27;s aid. As they approached the besieged Roman camp, the Belgae moved to engage Caesar&#x27;s troops. Vastly outnumbered, Caesar ordered his troops to appear confused and frightened, and they successfully lured the Belgae to attack them on ground favourable to the Romans. Caesar&#x27;s forces launched a fierce counterattack, and soon put the Belgae to flight. Later, Caesar&#x27;s troops entered Cicero&#x27;s camp to find most of the men wounded.

Meanwhile, Indutiomarus, a leader of the Treveri, began to harass Labienus&#x27;s camp daily, eventually provoking Labienus to send out his cavalry with specific orders to kill Indutiomarus. They did so, and routed the remnants of Indutiomarus&#x27;s army. Caesar personally remained in Gaul for the remainder of winter due to the renewed Gallic threat.

===Caesar&#x27;s revenge===
When the Roman Senate became aware of the latest events, Caesar swore to destroy all the Belgic tribes. Ambiorix had killed fifteen cohorts. A Belgic attack on Cicero, then stationed with a legion in the territory of the Nervii, failed due to the timely appearance of Caesar. The Roman campaigns against the Belgae took a few years, but eventually the tribes were slaughtered or driven out and their fields burned. The Eburones disappeared from history after this genocidal event. According to the writer Florus, Ambiorix and his men succeeded in escaping across the Rhine and vanished from history.

==Legacy==
Caesar wrote about Ambiorix in his commentary about his battles against the Gauls, &quot;De Bello Gallico&quot;. In this text he also famously wrote: &quot;Of these [three regions], the Belgae are the bravest.&quot; (&quot;...¬†&quot;Horum omnium fortissimi sunt Belgae&quot;¬†...&quot;).

Ambiorix remained a relatively obscure figure until the nineteenth century. The independence of Belgium in 1830 spurred a search for national heroes. In Caesar&#x27;s &quot;De Bello Gallico&quot;, Ambiorix and his deeds were rediscovered. In 1841, the Belgian poet Joannes Nolet de Brauwere Van Steeland wrote a lyrical epic about Ambiorix. Furthermore, on 5 September 1866 a statue of Ambiorix was erected on the main market square in Tongeren, Belgium, referred to by Caesar as Atuatuca, i.e. Atuatuca Tungrorum.

Today, Ambiorix is one of the most famous characters in Belgian history. Many companies, bars and friteries have named themselves after him, and in many Belgian comics such as Suske en Wiske and Jommeke he plays a guest role. There was also a short-lived comic called &quot;Ambionix&quot;, which featured a scientist teleporting a Belgic chief, loosely based on Ambiorix, to modern-day Belgium.

In the French comic Asterix, in the album &quot;Asterix in Belgium&quot;, Asterix, Obelix, Dogmatix and Vitalstatistix go to Belgium because they are angry with Caesar about his remark that the Belgians are the bravest of all the Gauls.

==In popular culture==
* Ambiorix leads the Gallic civilization in the &quot;New Frontier&quot; season pass of the 4X video game &quot;Civilization VI&quot;.

<text>August Wilhelm Ambros (17 November 181628 June 1876) was an Austrian music historian, critic and composer of Czech descent.

== Life ==
He was born in M√Ωto, Rokycany District, Bohemia. His father was a cultured man, and his mother was the sister of (1773‚Äì1850), the musical archaeologist and collector. Ambros studied at the University of Prague and was well-educated in music and the arts, which were his abiding passion. He was, however, destined for the law and an official career in the Austrian civil service, and from 1839 he occupied various important posts under the ministry of justice, music being an avocation.

From 1850 onwards, he became well known as a critic and essay-writer, and in 1860 he began working on his magnum opus, his &quot;History of Music&quot;, which was published at intervals from 1862 in five volumes, the last two (1878, 1882) being edited and completed by Otto Kade and .

Ambros was a professor of the history of music at Prague from 1869 to 1871. Also in Prague, he sat on the board of governors in the Prague Royal Conservatory. By 1872, he was living in Vienna and was employed by the Department of Justice as an officer and by Prince Rudolf&#x27;s family as his tutor. Through his work in Vienna, he was given a leave of absence for half the year in order to let him travel the world to collect musical information to include in his &quot;History of Music&quot; book. He was an excellent pianist, and the author of numerous compositions reminiscent of Felix Mendelssohn.

Ambros died at Vienna in 1876, aged 59.

<doc id="1701" wikidata="Q3783" url="?curid=1701" title="Amazon River">
<text>The Amazon River (, ; , ) in South America is the largest river by discharge volume of water in the world, and the longest or second-longest river system in the world, a title which is disputed with the Nile.

The headwaters of the Apur√≠mac River on Nevado Mismi had been considered, for nearly a century, the Amazon basin&#x27;s most distant source until a 2014 study found it to be the headwaters of the Mantaro River on the Cordillera Rumi Cruz in Peru. The Mantaro and Apur√≠mac rivers join, and with other tributaries form the Ucayali River, which in turn meets the Mara√±√≥n River upstream of Iquitos, Peru, forming what countries other than Brazil consider to be the main stem of the Amazon. Brazilians call this section the Solim√µes River above its confluence with the Rio Negro forming what Brazilians call the Amazon at the Meeting of Waters () at Manaus, the largest city on the river.

The Amazon River has an average discharge of about ‚Äîapproximately per year, greater than the next seven largest independent rivers combined. Two of the top ten rivers by discharge are tributaries of the Amazon river. The Amazon represents 20% of the global riverine discharge into oceans. The Amazon basin is the largest drainage basin in the world, with an area of approximately . The portion of the river&#x27;s drainage basin in Brazil alone is larger than any other river&#x27;s basin. The Amazon enters Brazil with only one-fifth of the flow it finally discharges into the Atlantic Ocean, yet already has a greater flow at this point than the discharge of any other river in the world.It has a length of 6,400 km (3977 miles) but according to some report its length varies from 7,025-7,100 km (4,365-4,410 miles).

==Etymology==
The Amazon was initially known by Europeans as the Mara√±√≥n, and the Peruvian part of the river is still known by that name, as well as the Brazilian state of Maranh√£o, which contains part of the Amazon. It later became known as Rio Amazonas in Spanish and Portuguese.

The name Rio Amazonas was reportedly given after native warriors attacked a 16th-century expedition by Francisco de Orellana. The warriors were led by women, reminding de Orellana of the Amazon warriors, a tribe of women warriors related to Iranian Scythians and Sarmatians mentioned in Greek mythology.
The word Amazon itself may be derived from the Iranian compound * ha-maz-an- &quot;(one) fighting together&quot; or ethnonym &quot;* ha-mazan-&quot; &quot;warriors&quot;, a word attested indirectly through a derivation, a denominal verb in Hesychius of Alexandria&#x27;s gloss (&quot;&quot;&quot;: &#x27;to make war&#x27; in Persian&quot;), where it appears together with the Indo-Iranian root &quot;* kar-&quot; &quot;make&quot; (from which Sanskrit &quot;karma&quot; is also derived).

Other scholars claim that the name is derived from the Tupi word &quot;amassona&quot;, meaning &quot;boat destroyer&quot;.

== History ==
=== Geological history ===
Recent geological studies suggest that for millions of years, the Amazon River flowed in the opposite direction ‚Äì from east to west. Eventually the Andes Mountains formed, blocking its flow to the Pacific Ocean and causing it to switch directions to its current mouth in the Atlantic Ocean.

=== Pre-Columbian era ===
During what many archaeologists called the &quot;formative stage&quot;, Amazonian societies were deeply involved in the emergence of South America&#x27;s highland agrarian systems. The trade with Andean civilizations in the terrains of the headwaters in the Andes formed an essential contribution to the social and religious development of higher-altitude civilizations like the Muisca and Incas. Early human settlements were typically based on low-lying hills or mounds.

Shell mounds were the earliest evidence of habitation; they represent piles of human refuse (waste) and are mainly dated between 7500¬†BC and 4000¬†BC. They are associated with ceramic age cultures; no preceramic shell mounds have been documented so far by archaeologists. Artificial earth platforms for entire villages are the second type of mounds. They are best represented by the Marajoara culture. Figurative mounds are the most recent types of occupation.

There is ample evidence that the areas surrounding the Amazon River were home to complex and large-scale indigenous societies, mainly chiefdoms who developed towns and cities. Archaeologists estimate that by the time the Spanish conquistador De Orellana traveled across the Amazon in 1541, more than 3 million indigenous people lived around the Amazon. These pre-Columbian settlements created highly developed civilizations. For instance, pre-Columbian indigenous people on the island of Maraj√≥ may have developed social stratification and supported a population of 100,000 people. To achieve this level of development, the indigenous inhabitants of the Amazon rainforest altered the forest&#x27;s ecology by selective cultivation and the use of fire. Scientists argue that by burning areas of the forest repeatedly, the indigenous people caused the soil to become richer in nutrients. This created dark soil areas known as &quot;terra preta de √≠ndio&quot; (&quot;Indian dark earth&quot;). Because of the terra preta, indigenous communities were able to make land fertile and thus sustainable for the large-scale agriculture needed to support their large populations and complex social structures. Further research has hypothesized that this practice began around 11,000 years ago. Some say that its effects on forest ecology and regional climate explain the otherwise inexplicable band of lower rainfall through the Amazon basin.

Many indigenous tribes engaged in constant warfare. According to James S. Olson, &quot;The Munduruku expansion (in the 18th century) dislocated and displaced the Kawah√≠b, breaking the tribe down into much smaller groups¬†... [Munduruku] first came to the attention of Europeans in 1770 when they began a series of widespread attacks on Brazilian settlements along the Amazon River.&quot;

=== Arrival of Europeans ===
In March 1500, Spanish conquistador Vicente Y√°√±ez Pinz√≥n was the first documented European to sail up the Amazon River. Pinz√≥n called the stream &quot;R√≠o Santa Mar√≠a del Mar Dulce&quot;, later shortened to &quot;Mar Dulce&quot;, literally, &quot;sweet sea&quot;, because of its freshwater pushing out into the ocean. Another Spanish explorer, Francisco de Orellana, was the first European to travel from the origins of the upstream river basins, situated in the Andes, to the mouth of the river. In this journey, Orellana baptized some of the affluents of the Amazonas like Rio Negro, Napo and Jurua.
The name Amazonas is thought to be taken from the native warriors that attacked this expedition, mostly women, that reminded De Orellana of the mythical female Amazon warriors from the ancient Hellenic culture in Greece (see also Origin of the name).

=== Exploration ===
Gonzalo Pizarro set off in 1541 to explore east of Quito into the South American interior in search of &quot;El Dorado&quot;, the &quot;city of gold&quot; and La Canela, the &quot;valley of cinnamon&quot;. He was accompanied by his second-in-command Francisco de Orellana. After , the Coca River joined the Napo River (at a point now known as Puerto Francisco de Orellana); the party stopped for a few weeks to build a boat just upriver from this confluence. They continued downriver through an uninhabited area, where they could not find food. Orellana offered and was ordered to follow the Napo River, then known as &quot;R√≠o de la Canela&quot; (&quot;Cinnamon River&quot;), and return with food for the party. Based on intelligence received from a captive native chief named Delicola, they expected to find food within a few days downriver by ascending another river to the north.

De Orellana took about 57 men, the boat, and some canoes and left Pizarro&#x27;s troops on 26 December 1541. However, De Orellana missed the confluence (probably with the Aguarico) where he was searching supplies for his men. By the time he and his men reached another village, many of them were sick from hunger and eating &quot;noxious plants&quot;, and near death. Seven men died in that village. His men threatened to mutiny if the expedition turned back to attempt to rejoin Pizarro, the party being over 100 leagues downstream at this point. He accepted to change the purpose of the expedition to discover new lands in the name of the king of Spain, and the men built a larger boat in which to navigate downstream. After a journey of down the Napo River, they reached a further major confluence, at a point near modern Iquitos, and then followed the upper Amazon, now known as the Solim√µes, for a further to its confluence with the Rio Negro (near modern Manaus), which they reached on 3 June 1542.

Regarding the initial mission of finding cinnamon, Pizarro reported to the king that they had found cinnamon trees, but that they could not be profitably harvested. True cinnamon (&quot;Cinnamomum Verum&quot;) is not native to South America. Other related cinnamon-containing plants (of the family &quot;Lauraceae&quot;) are fairly common in that part of the Amazon and Pizarro probably saw some of these. The expedition reached the mouth of the Amazon on 24 August 1542, demonstrating the practical navigability of the Great River.

In 1560, another Spanish conquistador, Lope de Aguirre, may have made the second descent of the Amazon. Historians are uncertain whether the river he descended was the Amazon or the Orinoco River, which runs more or less parallel to the Amazon further north.

Portuguese explorer Pedro Teixeira was the first European to travel up the entire river. He arrived in Quito in 1637, and returned via the same route.

From 1648 to 1652, Portuguese Brazilian &quot;bandeirante&quot; Ant√≥nio Raposo Tavares led an expedition from S√£o Paulo overland to the mouth of the Amazon, investigating many of its tributaries, including the Rio Negro, and covering a distance of over .

In what is currently in Brazil, Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela, several colonial and religious settlements were established along the banks of primary rivers and tributaries for trade, slaving , and evangelization among the indigenous peoples of the vast rainforest, such as the Urarina. In the late 1600s, Czech Jesuit Father Samuel Fritz, an apostle of the Omagus established some forty mission villages. Fritz proposed that the Mara√±√≥n River must be the source of the Amazon, noting on his 1707 map that the Mara√±√≥n &quot;has its source on the southern shore of a lake that is called Lauricocha, near Hu√°nuco.&quot; Fritz reasoned that the Mara√±√≥n is the largest river branch one encounters when journeying upstream, and lies farther to the west than any other tributary of the Amazon. For most of the 18th‚Äì19th centuries and into the 20th century, the Mara√±√≥n was generally considered the source of the Amazon.

=== Post-colonial exploitation and settlement ===

The Cabanagem revolt (1835‚Äì1840) was directed against the white ruling class. It is estimated that from 30% to 40% of the population of Gr√£o-Par√°, estimated at 100,000 people, died.

The population of the Brazilian portion of the Amazon basin in 1850 was perhaps 300,000, of whom about 175,000 were Europeans and 25,000 were slaves. The Brazilian Amazon&#x27;s principal commercial city, Par√° (now Bel√©m), had from 10,000 to 12,000 inhabitants, including slaves. The town of Man√°os, now Manaus, at the mouth of the Rio Negro, had a population between 1,000 and 1,500. All the remaining villages, as far up as Tabatinga, on the Brazilian frontier of Peru, were relatively small.

On 6 September 1850, Emperor Pedro II of Brazil sanctioned a law authorizing steam navigation on the Amazon and gave the Viscount of Mau√° (Irineu Evangelista de Sousa) the task of putting it into effect. He organised the &quot;Companhia de Navega√ß√£o e Com√©rcio do Amazonas&quot; in Rio de Janeiro in 1852; in the following year it commenced operations with four small steamers, the &quot;Monarca&quot; (&#x27;Monarch&#x27;), the &quot;Camet√°&quot;, the &quot;Maraj√≥&quot; and the &quot;Rio Negro&quot;.

At first, navigation was principally confined to the main river; and even in 1857 a modification of the government contract only obliged the company to a monthly service between Par√° and Manaus, with steamers of 200 tons cargo capacity, a second line to make six round voyages a year between Manaus and Tabatinga, and a third, two trips a month between Par√° and Camet√°. This was the first step in opening up the vast interior.

The success of the venture called attention to the opportunities for economic exploitation of the Amazon, and a second company soon opened commerce on the Madeira, Pur√∫s, and Negro; a third established a line between Par√° and Manaus, and a fourth found it profitable to navigate some of the smaller streams. In that same period, the Amazonas Company was increasing its fleet. Meanwhile, private individuals were building and running small steam craft of their own on the main river as well as on many of its tributaries.

On 31 July 1867, the government of Brazil, constantly pressed by the maritime powers and by the countries encircling the upper Amazon basin, especially Peru, decreed the opening of the Amazon to all countries, but they limited this to certain defined points: Tabatinga ‚Äì on the Amazon; Camet√° ‚Äì on the Tocantins; Santar√©m ‚Äì on the Tapaj√≥s; Borba ‚Äì on the Madeira, and Manaus ‚Äì on the Rio Negro. The Brazilian decree took effect on 7 September 1867.

Thanks in part to the mercantile development associated with steamboat navigation coupled with the internationally driven demand for natural rubber, the Peruvian city of Iquitos became a thriving, cosmopolitan center of commerce. Foreign companies settled in Iquitos, from where they controlled the extraction of rubber. In 1851 Iquitos had a population of 200, and by 1900 its population reached 20,000. In the 1860s, approximately 3,000 tons of rubber were being exported annually, and by 1911 annual exports had grown to 44,000 tons, representing 9.3% of Peru&#x27;s exports. During the rubber boom it is estimated that diseases brought by immigrants, such as typhus and malaria, killed 40,000 native Amazonians.

The first direct foreign trade with Manaus commenced around 1874. Local trade along the river was carried on by the English successors to the Amazonas Company‚Äîthe Amazon Steam Navigation Company‚Äîas well as numerous small steamboats, belonging to companies and firms engaged in the rubber trade, navigating the Negro, Madeira, Pur√∫s, and many other tributaries, such as the Mara√±√≥n, to ports as distant as Nauta, Peru.

By the turn of the 20th century, the exports of the Amazon basin were India-rubber, cacao beans, Brazil nuts and a few other products of minor importance, such as pelts and exotic forest produce (resins, barks, woven hammocks, prized bird feathers, live animals) and extracted goods, such as lumber and gold.

=== 20th-century development ===


Since colonial times, the Portuguese portion of the Amazon basin has remained a land largely undeveloped by agriculture and occupied by indigenous people who survived the arrival of European diseases.

Four centuries after the European discovery of the Amazon river, the total cultivated area in its basin was probably less than , excluding the limited and crudely cultivated areas among the mountains at its extreme headwaters. This situation changed dramatically during the 20th century.

Wary of foreign exploitation of the nation&#x27;s resources, Brazilian governments in the 1940s set out to develop the interior, away from the seaboard where foreigners owned large tracts of land. The original architect of this expansion was president Get√∫lio Vargas, with the demand for rubber from the Allied forces in World War II providing funding for the drive.

In the 1960s, economic exploitation of the Amazon basin was seen as a way to fuel the &quot;economic miracle&quot; occurring at the time. This resulted in the development of &quot;Operation Amazon&quot;, an economic development project that brought large-scale agriculture and ranching to Amazonia. This was done through a combination of credit and fiscal incentives.

However, in the 1970s the government took a new approach with the National Integration Program (PIN). A large-scale colonization program saw families from northeastern Brazil relocated to the &quot;land without people&quot; in the Amazon Basin. This was done in conjunction with infrastructure projects mainly the Trans-Amazonian Highway (&quot;Transamaz√¥nica&quot;).

The Trans-Amazonian Highway&#x27;s three pioneering highways were completed within ten years but never fulfilled their promise. Large portions of the Trans-Amazonian and its accessory roads, such as BR-317 (Manaus-Porto Velho), are derelict and impassable in the rainy season. Small towns and villages are scattered across the forest, and because its vegetation is so dense, some remote areas are still unexplored.

Many settlements grew along the road from Bras√≠lia to Bel√©m with the highway and National Integration Program, however, the program failed as the settlers were unequipped to live in the delicate rainforest ecosystem. This, although the government believed it could sustain millions, instead could sustain very few.

With a population of 1.9 million people in 2014, Manaus is the largest city on the Amazon. Manaus alone makes up approximately 50% of the population of the largest Brazilian state of Amazonas. The racial makeup of the city is 64% pardo (mulatto and mestizo) and 32% white.

Although the Amazon river remains undammed, around 412 dams are in operation on the Amazon&#x27;s tributary rivers. Of these 412 dams, 151 are constructed over six of the main tributary rivers that drain into the Amazon. Since only 4% of the Amazon&#x27;s hydropower potential has been developed in countries like Brazil, more damming projects are underway and hundreds more are planned. After witnessing the negative effects of environmental degradation, sedimentation, navigation and flood control caused by the Three Gorges Dam in the Yangtze River, scientists are worried that constructing more dams in the Amazon will harm its biodiversity in the same way by &quot;blocking fish-spawning runs, reducing the flows of vital oil nutrients and clearing forests&quot;. Damming the Amazon River could potentially bring about the &quot;end of free flowing rivers&quot; and contribute to an &quot;ecosystem collapse&quot; that will cause major social and environmental problems.

== Course ==
=== Origins ===

The most distant source of the Amazon was thought to be in the Apur√≠mac river drainage for nearly a century. Such studies continued to be published even as recently as 1996, 2001, 2007, and 2008, where various authors identified the snowcapped Nevado Mismi peak, located roughly west of Lake Titicaca and southeast of Lima, as the most distant source of the river. From that point, Quebrada Carhuasanta emerges from Nevado Mismi, joins Quebrada Apacheta and soon forms R√≠o Lloqueta which becomes R√≠o Hornillos and eventually joins the R√≠o Apur√≠mac.

A 2014 study by Americans James Contos and Nicolas Tripcevich in &quot;Area&quot;, a peer-reviewed journal of the Royal Geographical Society, however, identifies the most distant source of the Amazon as actually being in the R√≠o Mantaro drainage. A variety of methods were used to compare the lengths of the Mantaro river vs. the Apur√≠mac river from their most distant source points to their confluence, showing the longer length of the Mantaro. Then distances from Lago Jun√≠n to several potential source points in the uppermost Mantaro river were measured, which enabled them to determine that the Cordillera Rumi Cruz was the most distant source of water in the Mantaro basin (and therefore in the entire Amazon basin). The most accurate measurement method was direct GPS measurement obtained by kayak descent of each of the rivers from their source points to their confluence (performed by Contos). Obtaining these measurements was difficult given the class IV‚ÄìV nature of each of these rivers, especially in their lower &quot;Abyss&quot; sections. Ultimately, they determined that the most distant point in the Mantaro drainage is nearly 80¬†km farther upstream compared to Mt. Mismi in the Apur√≠mac drainage, and thus the maximal length of the Amazon river is about 80¬†km longer than previously thought. Contos continued downstream to the ocean and finished the first complete descent of the Amazon river from its newly identified source (finishing November 2012), a journey repeated by two groups after the news spread.

After about , the Apur√≠mac then joins R√≠o Mantaro to form the Ene, which joins the Perene to form the Tambo, which joins the Urubamba River to form the Ucayali. After the confluence of Apur√≠mac and Ucayali, the river leaves Andean terrain and is surrounded by floodplain. From this point to the confluence of the Ucayali and the Mara√±√≥n, some , the forested banks are just above the water and are inundated long before the river attains its maximum flood stage. The low river banks are interrupted by only a few hills, and the river enters the enormous Amazon rainforest.

=== The Upper Amazon or Solim√µes ===
Although the Ucayali‚ÄìMara√±√≥n confluence is the point at which most geographers place the beginning of the Amazon River proper, in Brazil the river is known at this point as the &quot;Solim√µes das √Åguas&quot;. The river systems and flood plains in Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela, whose waters drain into the &quot;Solim√µes&quot; and its tributaries, are called the &quot;Upper Amazon&quot;.

The Amazon proper runs mostly through Brazil and Peru, and is part of the border between Colombia and Peru. It has a series of major tributaries in Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, some of which flow into the Mara√±√≥n and Ucayali, and others directly into the Amazon proper. These include rivers Putumayo, Caquet√°, Vaup√©s, Guain√≠a, Morona, Pastaza, Nucuray, Urituyacu, Chambira, Tigre, Nanay, Napo, and Huallaga.

At some points, the river divides into anabranches, or multiple channels, often very long, with inland and lateral channels, all connected by a complicated system of natural canals, cutting the low, flat &quot;igap√≥&quot; lands, which are never more than above low river, into many islands.

From the town of Canaria at the great bend of the Amazon to the Negro, vast areas of land are submerged at high water, above which only the upper part of the trees of the sombre forests appear. Near the mouth of the Rio Negro to Serpa, nearly opposite the river Madeira, the banks of the Amazon are low, until approaching Manaus, they rise to become rolling hills.

=== The Lower Amazon ===

The Lower Amazon begins where the darkly colored waters of the Rio Negro meets the sandy-colored Rio Solim√µes (the upper Amazon), and for over these waters run side by side without mixing. At √ìbidos, a bluff above the river is backed by low hills. The lower Amazon seems to have once been a gulf of the Atlantic Ocean, the waters of which washed the cliffs near √ìbidos.

Only about 10% of the Amazon&#x27;s water enters downstream of √ìbidos, very little of which is from the northern slope of the valley. The drainage area of the Amazon basin above √ìbidos city is about , and, below, only about (around 20%), exclusive of the of the Tocantins basin. The Tocantins River enters the southern portion of the Amazon delta.

In the lower reaches of the river, the north bank consists of a series of steep, table-topped hills extending for about from opposite the mouth of the Xingu as far as Monte Alegre. These hills are cut down to a kind of terrace which lies between them and the river.

On the south bank, above the Xingu, a line of low bluffs bordering the floodplain extends nearly to Santar√©m in a series of gentle curves before they bend to the southwest, and, abutting upon the lower Tapaj√≥s, merge into the bluffs which form the terrace margin of the Tapaj√≥s river valley.

=== Mouth ===
Bel√©m is the major city and port at the mouth of the river at the Atlantic Ocean. The definition of where exactly the mouth of the Amazon is located, and how wide it is, is a matter of dispute, because of the area&#x27;s peculiar geography. The Par√° and the Amazon are connected by a series of river channels called &quot;furos&quot; near the town of Breves; between them lies Maraj√≥, the world&#x27;s largest combined river/sea island.

If the Par√° river and the Maraj√≥ island ocean frontage are included, the Amazon estuary is some wide. In this case, the width of the mouth of the river is usually measured from Cabo Norte, the cape located straight east of Pracu√∫ba in the Brazilian state of Amap√°, to Ponta da Tijoca near the town of Curu√ß√°, in the state of Par√°.

A more conservative measurement excluding the Par√° river estuary, from the mouth of the Araguari River to Ponta do Navio on the northern coast of Maraj√≥, would still give the mouth of the Amazon a width of over . If only the river&#x27;s main channel is considered, between the islands of Curu√° (state of Amap√°) and Jurupari (state of Par√°), the width falls to about .

The plume generated by the river&#x27;s discharge covers up to 1.3 million km2 and is responsible for muddy bottoms influencing a wide area of the tropical north Atlantic in terms of salinity, pH, light penetration, and sedimentation.

=== Lack of bridges ===
There are no bridges across the entire width of the river. This is not because the river would be too wide to bridge; for most of its length, engineers could build a bridge across the river easily. For most of its course, the river flows through the Amazon Rainforest, where there are very few roads and cities. Most of the time, the crossing can be done by a ferry. The Manaus Iranduba Bridge linking the cities of Manaus and Iranduba spans the Rio Negro, the second-largest tributary of the Amazon, just before their confluence.

=== Dispute regarding length ===

While debate as to whether the Amazon or the Nile is the world&#x27;s longest river has gone on for many years, the historic consensus of geographic authorities has been to regard the Amazon as the second longest river in the world, with the Nile being the longest. However, the Amazon has been reported as being anywhere between and long. It is often said to be &quot;at least&quot; long. The Nile is reported to be anywhere from . Often it is said to be &quot;about&quot; long. There are several factors that can affect these measurements, such as the position of the geographical source and the mouth, the scale of measurement, and the length measuring techniques (for details see also List of rivers by length).

In July 2008, the Brazilian Institute for Space Research (INPE) published a news article on their webpage, claiming that the Amazon River was longer than the Nile. The Amazon&#x27;s length was calculated as , taking the Apacheta Creek as its source. Using the same techniques, the length of the Nile was calculated as , which is longer than previous estimates but still shorter than the Amazon. The results were reached by measuring the Amazon downstream to the beginning of the tidal estuary of &quot;Canal do Sul&quot; and then, after a sharp turn back, following tidal canals surrounding the isle of Maraj√≥ and finally including the marine waters of the &quot;R√≠o Par√°&quot; bay in its entire length. According to an earlier article on the webpage of the National Geographic, the Amazon&#x27;s length was calculated as by a Brazilian scientist. In June 2007, Guido Gelli, director of science at the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), told London&#x27;s Telegraph Newspaper that it could be considered that the Amazon was the longest river in the world. However, according to the above sources, none of the two results was published, and questions were raised about the researchers&#x27; methodology. In 2009, a peer-reviewed article, was published, concluding that the Nile is longer than the Amazon by stating a length of for the Nile and for the Amazon, measured by using a combination of satellite image analysis and field investigations to the source regions.
According to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, the final length of the Amazon remains open to interpretation and continued debate.

== Watershed ==

The Amazon basin, the largest in the world, covers about 40% of South America, an area of approximately . It drains from west to east, from Iquitos in Peru, across Brazil to the Atlantic. It gathers its waters from 5 degrees north latitude to 20 degrees south latitude. Its most remote sources are found on the inter-Andean plateau, just a short distance from the Pacific Ocean.

The Amazon River and its tributaries are characterised by extensive forested areas that become flooded every rainy season. Every year, the river rises more than , flooding the surrounding forests, known as &quot;v√°rzea&quot; (&quot;flooded forests&quot;). The Amazon&#x27;s flooded forests are the most extensive example of this habitat type in the world. In an average dry season, of land are water-covered, while in the wet season, the flooded area of the Amazon basin rises to .

The quantity of water released by the Amazon to the Atlantic Ocean is enormous: up to in the rainy season, with an average of from 1973 to 1990. The Amazon is responsible for about 20% of the Earth&#x27;s fresh water entering the ocean. The river pushes a vast plume of fresh water into the ocean. The plume is about long and between wide. The fresh water, being lighter, flows on top of the seawater, diluting the salinity and altering the colour of the ocean surface over an area up to in extent. For centuries ships have reported fresh water near the Amazon&#x27;s mouth yet well out of sight of land in what otherwise seemed to be the open ocean.

The Atlantic has sufficient wave and tidal energy to carry most of the Amazon&#x27;s sediments out to sea, thus the Amazon does not form a true delta. The great deltas of the world are all in relatively protected bodies of water, while the Amazon empties directly into the turbulent Atlantic.

There is a natural water union between the Amazon and the Orinoco basins, the so-called Casiquiare canal. The Casiquiare is a river distributary of the upper Orinoco, which flows southward into the Rio Negro, which in turn flows into the Amazon. The Casiquiare is the largest river on earth that links two major river systems, a so-called bifurcation.

=== Flooding ===
Not all of the Amazon&#x27;s tributaries flood at the same time of the year. Many branches begin flooding in November and might continue to rise until June. The rise of the Rio Negro starts in February or March and begins to recede in June. The Madeira River rises and falls two months earlier than most of the rest of the Amazon river.

The depth of the Amazon between Manacapuru and √ìbidos has been calculated as between . At Manacapuru, the Amazon&#x27;s water level is only about above mean sea level. More than half of the water in the Amazon downstream of Manacapuru is below sea level. In its lowermost section, the Amazon&#x27;s depth averages , in some places as much as .

The main river is navigable for large ocean steamers to Manaus, upriver from the mouth. Smaller ocean vessels below 9000 tons and with less than draft can reach as far as Iquitos, Peru, from the sea. Smaller riverboats can reach higher, as far as Achual Point. Beyond that, small boats frequently ascend to the Pongo de Manseriche, just above Achual Point in Peru.

Annual flooding occurs in late northern latitude winter at high tide when the incoming waters of the Atlantic are funnelled into the Amazon delta. The resulting undular tidal bore is called the &quot;pororoca&quot;, with a leading wave that can be up to high and travel up to inland.

== Geology ==
The Amazon River originated as a transcontinental river in the Miocene epoch between 11.8 million and 11.3 million years ago and took its present shape approximately 2.4 million years ago in the Early Pleistocene.

The proto-Amazon during the Cretaceous flowed west, as part of a proto-Amazon-Congo river system, from the interior of present-day Africa when the continents were connected, forming western Gondwana. 80 million years ago, the two continents split. Fifteen million years ago, the main tectonic uplift phase of the Andean chain started. This tectonic movement is caused by the subduction of the Nazca Plate underneath the South American Plate. The rise of the Andes and the linkage of the Brazilian and Guyana bedrock shields, blocked the river and caused the Amazon Basin to become a vast inland sea. Gradually, this inland sea became a massive swampy, freshwater lake and the marine inhabitants adapted to life in freshwater.

Eleven to ten million years ago, waters worked through the sandstone from the west and the Amazon began to flow eastward, leading to the emergence of the Amazon rainforest. During glacial periods, sea levels dropped and the great Amazon lake rapidly drained and became a river, which would eventually become the disputed world&#x27;s longest, draining the most extensive area of rainforest on the planet.

Paralleling the Amazon River is a large aquifer, dubbed the Hamza River, the discovery of which was made public in August 2011.

=== Fauna ===

More than one-third of all known species in the world live in the Amazon rainforest. It is the richest tropical forest in the world in terms of biodiversity. In addition to thousands of species of fish, the river supports crabs, algae, and turtles.

==== Mammals ====
Along with the Orinoco, the Amazon is one of the main habitats of the &quot;boto&quot;, also known as the Amazon river dolphin (&quot;Inia geoffrensis&quot;). It is the largest species of river dolphin, and it can grow to lengths of up to . The colour of its skin changes with age; young animals are gray, but become pink and then white as they mature. The dolphins use echolocation to navigate and hunt in the river&#x27;s tricky depths. The &quot;boto&quot; is the subject of a legend in Brazil about a dolphin that turns into a man and seduces maidens by the riverside.

The tucuxi (&quot;Sotalia fluviatilis&quot;), also a dolphin species, is found both in the rivers of the Amazon basin and in the coastal waters of South America. The Amazonian manatee (&quot;Trichechus inunguis&quot;), also known as &quot;seacow&quot;, is found in the northern Amazon River basin and its tributaries. It is a mammal and a herbivore. Its population is limited to freshwater habitats, and, unlike other manatees, it does not venture into saltwater. It is classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

The Amazon and its tributaries are the main habitat of the giant otter (&quot;Pteronura brasiliensis&quot;). Sometimes known as the &quot;river wolf,&quot; it is one of South America&#x27;s top carnivores. Because of habitat destruction and hunting, its population has dramatically decreased. It is now listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), which effectively bans international trade.

==== Reptiles ====
The anaconda is found in shallow waters in the Amazon basin. One of the world&#x27;s largest species of snake, the anaconda spends most of its time in the water with just its nostrils above the surface. Species of caimans, that are related to alligators and other crocodilians, also inhabit the Amazon as do varieties of turtles.

==== Birds ====
==== Fish ====

The Amazonian fish fauna is the centre of diversity for neotropical fishes, some of which are popular aquarium specimens like the neon tetra and the freshwater angelfish. More than 5,600 species were known , and approximately fifty new species are discovered each year. The arapaima, known in Brazil as the &quot;pirarucu&quot;, is a South American tropical freshwater fish, one of the largest freshwater fish in the world, with a length of up to . Another Amazonian freshwater fish is the arowana (or &quot;aruan√£&quot; in Portuguese), such as the silver arowana (&quot;Osteoglossum bicirrhosum&quot;), which is a predator and very similar to the arapaima, but only reaches a length of . Also present in large numbers is the notorious piranha, an omnivorous fish that congregates in large schools and may attack livestock. There are approximately 30 to 60 species of piranha. The candir√∫, native to the Amazon River, is a species of parasitic fresh water catfish in the family Trichomycteridae, just one of more than 1200 species of catfish in the Amazon basin. Other catfish &#x27;walk&#x27; overland on their ventral fins, while the kumakuma (&quot;Brachyplatystoma filamentosum&quot;), aka &quot;piraiba&quot; or &quot;goliath catfish&quot;, can reach in length and in weight.

The electric eel (&quot;Electrophorus electricus&quot;) and more than 100 species of electric fishes (Gymnotiformes) inhabit the Amazon basin. River stingrays (Potamotrygonidae) are also known. The bull shark (&quot;Carcharhinus leucas&quot;), a euryhaline species which can thrive in both salt and fresh water, has been reported as far as up the Amazon River at Iquitos in Peru.

==== Butterflies ====
==== Microbiota ====
Freshwater microbes are generally not very well known, even less so for a pristine ecosystem like the Amazon. Recently, metagenomics has provided answers to what kind of microbes inhabit the river. The most important microbes in the Amazon River are Actinomycetota, Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Thermoproteota.

== Challenges ==
The Amazon River serves as a vital lifeline for more than 47 million people in its basin and faces a multitude of challenges that threaten both its ecosystem and the indigenous communities dependent on its resources. According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the Yanomami, a tribe of approximately 29,000, struggles to preserve their land, culture, and traditional way of life due to encroaching illegal gold miners, malnutrition, and malaria. Meanwhile, in 2022, the region&#x27;s severe drought, has led to a devastating increase in water temperatures, reaching 39.1 degrees Celsius, causing the demise of 125 Amazon river dolphins. This event displays the deteriorating environmental conditions and indicates the increasing vulnerability of the river&#x27;s ecosystem. In recent years, the Amazon River has experienced historically low water levels, the lowest in over a century. Brazil, the primary custodian of this invaluable natural resource, grapples with the challenges of mitigating the effects of this drought on communities and ecosystems, further emphasizing the urgency of sustainable environmental management and conservation efforts.

<text>Alfred of Beverley was an English chronicler, and sacrist of the collegiate church of St John the Evangelist and St John of Beverley wrote a history of Britain and England in nine chapters (c. 1148- c.1151) from its supposed foundation by the Trojan Brutus, down to the death of Henry I in 1135. Alfred&#x27;s chief sources, in addition to Bede&#x27;s &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica de Gentis Anglorum ,&quot; are Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae,&quot; Henry of Huntingdon&#x27;s &quot;Historia Anglorum, The Chronicle of John of Worcester,&quot; and the &quot;Historia Regum&quot;, attributed to Symeon of Durham.

==Biography==
Alfred of Beverley, was a priest of Beverley, and is described in the preface to his book as &quot;treasurer of the church of Beverley&quot; and &quot;Master Alfred, sacrist of the church of Beverley&quot;.

Alfred of Beverley speaks of himself as contemporary with the removal of the Flemings from the north of England to Ross in Herefordshire in 1112, and writes that he compiled his chronicle &quot;when the church was silent, owing to the number of persons excommunicated under the decree of the council of London&quot;, an apparent reference to the council held at Mid-Lent, 1143. His attention, by his own account, was first drawn to history by the publication (before 1139) of Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s Historia Regum Britanniae, and he looked forward to following up the chronicle which bears his name, and which largely depends on Geoffrey&#x27;s work, with a collection of excerpts from the credible portions of the Historia Regum Britanniae, but no trace of such a work is extant.

Alfred of Beverley&#x27;s chronicle is entitled &quot;Aluredi Beverlacensis Annales sive Historia de gestis Regum Britanni√¶ libris ix. ad annum 1129&quot;. It is largely devoted to the fabulous history of Britain, and is mainly borrowed from Bede, Henry of Huntingdon, and Symeon of Durham, when Geoffrey of Monmouth is not laid under contribution. Alfred quotes occasionally from Suetonius, Orosius, and Nennius, and names many Roman authors whom he had consulted in vain for references to Britain. The chronicle is of no real use to the historical student, since it adds no new fact to the information to be found in well-known earlier authorities.

According to Sidney Lee (1885) the best manuscript of Alfred&#x27;s &quot;Annales&quot; was among the Hengwrt MSS. belonging to W. W. E. Wynne, Esq., of Peniarth, Merionethshire, and had not been printed. Hearne printed the ‚ÄòAnnales‚Äô in 1716 from an inferior Bodleian MS. (Rawl. B. 200).

<text>Autpert Ambrose (Ambroise) () (ca. 730 ‚Äì 784) was a Frankish Benedictine monk. An abbot of San Vincenzo al Volturno in South Italy in the time of Desiderius, king of the Lombards, Autpert wrote a considerable number of works on the Bible and religious subjects generally. Among these are commentaries on the Apocalypse, on the Psalms, and on the Song of Songs; a life of the founders of the monastery of San Vincenzo (); and a &quot;Conflictus vitiorum et virtutum&quot; (Combat between the Virtues and the Vices). Jean Mabillon calls him &quot;sanctissimus&quot; because of his great virtue and the Bollandists gave him the title &quot;saint&quot;. His cultus has been approved.

== Biography ==
Autpert Ambrose was born in Gaul, probably Provence, at the beginning of the eighth century. He moved to Italy and entered the Benedictine monastery of San Vincenzo al Volturno, near Benevento, in Southern Italy, where he received his intellectual and spiritual formation and was ordained a priest sometime before 761. He became abbot on 4 October 777. In 774 Charlemagne had defeated the Lombards, but had not subjugated the Duchy of Benevento: Autpert&#x27;s election aggravated the disputes between French and Lombard monks, and on 28 December 778 he was forced to leave the monastery to the Lombard Poto and flee to Spoleto. Summoned to Rome by Charlemagne to resolve the conflict, he died on the way, perhaps murdered, in 784. Information about his life is available primarily from the fragmentary &quot;Chronicon Vulturnense&quot; written by a monk named John, and from brief autobiographical references in some of his own writings. The same chronicle places him in the court of Charlemagne. This is apparently an error due to the confusion of Autpert with a certain Aspertus or Asbertus, who was chancellor of Prince Arnolfus from 888 to 892.

In 2009, Pope Benedict XVI gave a homily about him in Saint Peter&#x27;s square. In this homily, Autpert&#x27;s death date is given as 784 (older scholarship had given a date between 778 and 779).

== Works ==
Autpert&#x27;s most famous work is his lengthy &quot;Expositio in Apocalypsin&quot; which is dependent upon a variety of patristic authors whom Autpert explicitly acknowledges, including Jerome, Victorinus, Ticonius, Augustine of Hippo, Primasius of Hadrumetum, and Gregory the Great. In fact, this commentary is one of the sources for a partial reconstruction of the lost Apocalypse commentary of the Donatist Ticonius. It is prefaced by a letter to Pope Stephen III in which Autpert defends himself from his detractors. His &quot;Vita sanctorum patrum Paldonis, Tatonis et Tasonis&quot; is an account of the three founders of the monastery at Volturno who through their pious lives offer an example of the imitation of Christ. His &quot;Libellus de conflictu vitiorum atque virtutum&quot; emphasizes monastic themes such as fear of God, obedience, and fidelity. Other works include &quot;Oratio contra septem vitia&quot;, &quot;Sermo de cupiditate&quot;, &quot;Sermo in purificatione sanctae Mariae&quot;, &quot;Homilia de transfiguratione Domini&quot;, and &quot;Sermo de adsumptione sanctae Mariae&quot;. Several additional sermons, known to have existed, have not survived. His extant sermons are marked by a strong mystical imprint. His commentaries on Leviticus, the Song of Songs, and the Psalms, mentioned in the &quot;Chronicon Vulturnese&quot;, are also not extant. Whether or not Autpert is the author of the hymn &quot;Ave maris stella&quot; is debated. The reason for this possible attribution is that Mary plays a significant theological role in both his sermons and Apocalypse commentary. She is not only a figure of the Church but also its most excellent member. As mother of Christ, she is also mother of the elect.

== &quot;Expositio in Apocalypsin&quot; ==
Autpert&#x27;s masterpiece is considered his &quot;Expositio in Apocalypsin&quot;, a lengthy commentary on the Book of Revelation. Autpert refers to various early Christian writers in order to give his commentary authority. In addition, he uses the writers to correct heresy where he believed it to exist. Although he is very careful not to depart from the tradition of the Church or from orthodox teaching, his work is no mere string of patristic quotations. Throughout his Apocalypse commentary Christ is mystically identified with the Church, so much so that the Church actually begins with the birth of Christ. In addition, there is only one Church in heaven and on earth, not two. To those knowing the truth there is manifest one and the same Church, neither divided nor separated, which reigns with Christ in heaven, encompassing those members who have completed their struggle, and which reigns with Christ on earth, encompassing those members who continue in battle. The first resurrection (cf. Rev. 20:5b‚Äì6a), which implies a second, refers to the reign of Christ for a thousand years and the reign of the just with him. The second resurrection refers not to the resurrection of the flesh from dust but rather to the life of the soul rising from the abandonment of sin. The second death (cf. Rev. 20:6b) is eternal damnation. Gog and Magog (cf. Rev. 20:8) refer to the nations all over the earth which are agents of the devil persecuting the Church. The book of life (cf. Rev. 20:12) is the Old and New Testament, whose contemplation brings the elect to the light of day and the love of neighbour. The city of God continuously grows in number through the washing and regeneration of the Holy Spirit, and at the end of the present age the Last Judgment of God will come through his son Jesus Christ.

<doc id="1715" wikidata="Q334923" url="?curid=1715" title="Abu Bakr">
<text>Abd Allah ibn Abi Quhafa (; 23 August 634), commonly known by the &quot;kunya&quot; Abu Bakr (), was the first caliph, ruling from 632 until his death in 634. A close companion and father-in-law of Muhammad, Abu Bakr is referred to with the honorific title &quot;al-·π¢iddƒ´q&quot; (, lit. the Veracious) by Sunni Muslims.

Born to Abu Quhafa and Umm al-Khayr of the Banu Taym, Abu Bakr was amongst the earliest converts to Islam and propagated dawah to the Mushrikites. He was considered the first Muslim missionary as several companions of Muhammad converted through Abu Bakr. He accompanied Muhammad on his migration to Medina and became one of the latter&#x27;s bodyguards. Abu Bakr participated in all of Muhammad&#x27;s campaigns and served as the first in 631. In the absence of Muhammad, Abu Bakr led the prayers.

Following Muhammad&#x27;s death in 632, Abu Bakr succeeded the leadership of the Muslim community as the first caliph, being elected at Saqifa. His election was contested by a number of rebellious tribal leaders. During his reign, he overcame a number of uprisings, collectively known as the Ridda wars, as a result of which he was able to consolidate and expand the rule of the Muslim state over the entire Arabian Peninsula. He also commanded the initial incursions into the neighbouring Sasanian and Byzantine empires, which in the years following his death, would eventually result in the Muslim conquests of Persia and the Levant. Apart from politics, Abu Bakr is also credited for the compilation of the Quran, of which he had a personal caliphal codex. Prior to dying in August 634, Abu Bakr nominated Umar () as his successor. Along with Muhammad, Abu Bakr is buried in the Green Dome at the Al-Masjid an-Nabawi in Medina, the second holiest site in Islam. He died of illness after a reign of 2 years, 2 months and 14 days, the only Rashidun caliph to die of natural causes.

Though Abu Bakr&#x27;s reign was short, it included successful invasions of the two most powerful empires of the time, the Sassanian Empire and the Byzantine Empire. He set in motion a historical trajectory that in a few decades would lead to one of the largest empires in history. His victory over the local rebel Arab forces is a significant part of Islamic history. Sunni Muslims revere Abu Bakr as the first of the rightly-guided caliphs and the greatest individual after the prophets and messengers. Shia tradition considers Abu Bakr an usurper of the caliphate and an enemy of the .

==Lineage and titles==

According to Ibn Sa&#x27;d, Abu Bakr&#x27;s full name was Abdullah ibn Abi Quhafa ibn Amer ibn Amr ibn Ka&#x27;ab ibn Sa&#x27;ad ibn Taym ibn Murrah ibn Ka&#x27;ab ibn Lu&#x27;ayy ibn Ghalib ibn Fihr ibn Malik ibn Al-Nader ibn Kinanah ibn Khouzayma ibn Mudrikah ibn Ilyas ibn Mudhar ibn Nizar ibn Ma&#x27;add ibn Adnan. This lineage meets the lineage of Muhammad at the sixth generation with Murrah ibn Ka&#x27;b.

===Abdullah===

In Arabic, the name &quot;Abd Allah&quot; means &quot;servant of Allah&quot;. This is his birth name.

===Abu Bakr===
This nickname (kunya) was given to him as a child when he grew up among a bedouin tribe and developed a fondness for camels. He played with the camel calves and goats, earning this nickname &quot;Abu Bakr,&quot; meaning &quot;father of the young camel.&quot; A &quot;bakr&quot; in Arabic is a young but already fully grown camel.

===Ateeq===

One of his early titles, preceding his conversion to Islam, was &quot;Ateeq&quot;, meaning &quot;saved one&quot;. In a weak narration in Tirmidhi, Muhammad later restated this title when he said that Abu Bakr is the &quot;Ateeq of Allah from the fire&quot; meaning &quot;saved&quot; or &quot;secure&quot; and the association with Allah showing how close to and protected he is by Allah.

===al-Siddiq===

He was called (&#x27;the truthful&#x27;) by Muhammad after he believed him in the event of Isra and Mi&#x27;raj when other people did not, and Ali confirmed that title several times. He was also reportedly referred to in the Quran as the &quot;second of the two in the cave&quot; in reference to the event of hijra, where with Muhammad he hid in the cave in Jabal Thawr from the Meccan party that was sent after them.

While traditional sources translate this epithet as &#x27;the truthful&#x27;, an equally likely interpretation is &#x27;the tax collector&#x27; (i.e., the collector of ).

===al-Sahib===
He was honorifically called &quot;al-sahib&quot; (the companion) in the Qur&#x27;an describing his role as a companion of Muhammad when hiding from the Quraysh in the Jabal Thawr cave during the Hijra to Medina:

===Al-AtqƒÅ===
In a hadith narrated by ibn Abbas of the exegesis of chapter 92 of the Qur&#x27;an by imam al-Suyuti we find the word &quot;al-atqƒÅ&quot; (), meaning &quot;the most pious,&quot; &quot;the most righteous,&quot; or &quot;the most God-fearing,&quot; is referring to Abu Bakr as an example for the believers.

===Al-AwwƒÅh===
&quot;Al-AwwƒÅh&quot; () means someone who supplicates abundantly to God, someone who is merciful, and the gentle-hearted. Ibrahim al-Nakha&#x27;i said that Abu Bakr has also been called al-awwƒÅh for his merciful character.

==Early life==
Abu Bakr was born in Mecca sometime in 573 CE, to a rich family in the Banu Taym tribe of the Quraysh tribal confederacy. His father was Abu Quhafa and his mother was Umm al-Khayr.

He spent his early childhood like other Arab children of the time, among the Bedouins who called themselves &quot;Ahl-i-Ba&#x27;eer&quot;- the people of the camel, and developed a particular fondness for camels. In his early years he played with the camel calves and goats, and his love for camels earned him the nickname (&quot;kunya&quot;) &quot;Abu Bakr&quot;, the father of the camel&#x27;s calf.

Like other children of the rich Meccan merchant families, Abu Bakr was literate and developed a fondness for poetry. He used to attend the annual fair at Ukaz, and participate in poetical symposia. He had a very good memory and had a good knowledge of the genealogy of the Arab tribes, their stories and their politics.

A story is preserved that once when he was a child, his father took him to the Kaaba, and asked him to pray before the idols. His father went away to attend to some other business, and Abu Bakr was left alone. Addressing an idol, Abu Bakr said &quot;O my God, I am in need of beautiful clothes; bestow them on me&quot;. The idol remained indifferent. Then he addressed another idol, saying, &quot;O God, give me some delicious food. See that I am so hungry&quot;. The idol remained cold. That exhausted the patience of young Abu Bakr. He lifted a stone, and, addressing an idol, said, &quot;Here I am aiming a stone; if you are a god protect yourself&quot;. Abu Bakr hurled the stone at the idol and left the Kaaba. Regardless, it recorded that prior to converting to Islam, Abu Bakr practiced as a &quot;hanif&quot; and never worshipped idols.

==Companionship of Muhammad==

On his return from a business trip in Yemen, friends informed him that in his absence, Muhammad had declared himself a messenger of God. According to a report of the historian Al-Tabari, in his &quot;Tarikh al-Tabari&quot;, Abu Bakr may have converted to Islam after around fifty people, though this is disputed. Some Sunni and all the Shi&#x27;a believe that the second person to publicly accept Muhammed as the messenger of God was Ali ibn Abi Talib, the first being Muhammad&#x27;s wife Khadija. Ibn Kathir, in his &quot;Al Bidaya Wal Nihayah&quot;, disregards this. He stated that the first woman to embrace Islam was Khadijah. Zayd ibn Harithah was the first freed slave to embrace Islam. Ali ibn Abi Talib was the first child to embrace Islam, for he has not even reached the age of puberty at that time, while Abu Bakr was the first free man to embrace Islam. 

===Subsequent life in Mecca===
His wife Qutaylah bint Abd-al-Uzza did not accept Islam and he divorced her. His other wife, Um Ruman, became a Muslim. All his children accepted Islam except Abd al-Rahman, from whom Abu Bakr disassociated himself. His conversion also brought many people to Islam. He persuaded his intimate friends to convert, and presented Islam to other friends in such a way that many of them also accepted the faith. Those who converted to Islam at the dawah of Abu Bakr were:
* Uthman Ibn Affan (who would become the 3rd Caliph)
* Al-Zubayr (who played a part in the Muslim conquest of Egypt)
* Talha ibn Ubayd-Allah, his cousin and an important companion of Muhammad.
* &#x27;Abd al-Rahman ibn &#x27;Awf (who would remain an important part of the Rashidun Caliphate)
* Sa&#x27;d ibn Abi Waqqas (who played a leading role in the Islamic conquest of Persia)
* Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah (who was a commander in chief of the Rashidun army in Levant)
* Abu Salama, he was a foster brother of Muhammad.
* Khalid ibn Sa&#x27;id, (who acted as a general under the Rashidun army in Syria)

Abu Bakr&#x27;s acceptance proved to be a milestone in Muhammad&#x27;s mission. Slavery was common in Mecca, and many slaves accepted Islam. When an ordinary free man accepted Islam, despite opposition, he would enjoy the protection of his tribe. For slaves, however, there was no such protection and they commonly experienced persecution. Abu Bakr felt compassion for slaves, so he purchased eight (four men and four women) and then freed them, paying 40,000 dinar for their freedom. He was known to have freed slaves, including Bilal ibn Rabah.

The men were:
* Bilal ibn Rabah
* Abu Fukayha
* Ammar ibn Yasir
* Amir ibn Fuhayra
The women were:
* Lubaynah
* Al-Nahdiah
* Umm Ubays
* Harithah bint al-Muammil

Most of the slaves liberated by Abu Bakr were either women or old and frail men. When the father of Abu Bakr asked him why he did not liberate strong and young slaves, who could be a source of strength for him, Abu Bakr replied that he was freeing the slaves for the sake of God, and not for his own sake.

===Persecution by the Quraysh, 613===

For three years after the birth of Islam, Muslims kept their faith private. In 613, according to Islamic tradition, Muhammad was commanded by God to call people to Islam openly. The first public address inviting people to offer allegiance to Muhammad was delivered by Abu Bakr. In a fit of fury, the young men of the Quraysh tribe rushed at Abu Bakr and beat him until he lost consciousness. Following this incident, Abu Bakr&#x27;s mother converted to Islam. Abu Bakr was persecuted many times by the Quraysh. Though Abu Bakr&#x27;s beliefs would have been defended by his own clan, it would not be so for the entire Quraysh tribe.

===Last years in Mecca===
In 617, the Quraysh enforced a boycott against the Banu Hashim. Muhammad along with his supporters from Banu Hashim, were cut off in a pass away from Mecca. All social relations with the Banu Hashim were cut off and their state was that of imprisonment. Before it many Muslims migrated to Abyssinia (now Ethiopia). Abu Bakr, feeling distressed, set out for Yemen and then to Abyssinia from there. He met a friend of his named Ad-Dughna (chief of the Qarah tribe) outside Mecca, who invited Abu Bakr to seek his protection against the Quraysh. Abu Bakr went back to Mecca, it was a relief for him, but soon due to the pressure of Quraysh, Ad-Dughna was forced to renounce his protection. Once again the Quraysh were free to persecute Abu Bakr.

In 620, Muhammad&#x27;s uncle and protector, Abu Talib ibn Abd al-Muttalib, and Muhammad&#x27;s wife Khadija died. Abu Bakr&#x27;s daughter Aisha was betrothed to Muhammad; however, it was decided that the actual marriage ceremony would be held later. In 620 Abu Bakr was the first person to testify to Muhammad&#x27;s Isra and Mi&#x27;raj (Night Journey).

=== Migration to Medina ===
In 622, on the invitation of the Muslims of Medina, Muhammad ordered Muslims to migrate to Medina. The migration began in batches. Ali was the last to remain in Mecca, entrusted with responsibility for settling any loans the Muslims had taken out, and famously slept in the bed of Muhammad when the Quraysh, led by Ikrima, attempted to murder Muhammad as he slept. Meanwhile, Abu Bakr accompanied Muhammad to Medina. Due to the danger posed by the Quraysh, they did not take the road, but moved in the opposite direction, taking refuge in a cave in Jabal Thawr, some five miles south of Mecca. Abd Allah ibn Abi Bakr, the son of Abu Bakr, would listen to the plans and discussions of the Quraysh, and at night he would carry the news to the fugitives in the cave. Asma bint Abi Bakr, the daughter of Abu Bakr, brought them meals every day. Aamir, a servant of Abu Bakr, would bring a flock of goats to the mouth of the cave every night, where they were milked. The Quraysh sent search parties in all directions. One party came close to the entrance to the cave, but was unable to see them. Abu Bakr was referenced in the Qur&#x27;an in verse 40 of : &quot;If ye help him not, still God helped him when those who disbelieve drove him forth, the (second of the two i.e. Abu Bakr); when they two were in the cave, when he said unto his (companion i.e. Abu Bakr). Aisha, Abu Sa Ωid al-Khudri and Abd Allah ibn Abbas in interpreting this verse said that Abu Bakr was the companion who stayed with Muhammad in the cave.

After staying at the cave for three days and three nights, Abu Bakr and Muhammad proceed to Medina, staying for some time at Quba, a suburb of Medina.

===Life in Medina===
In Medina, Muhammad decided to construct a mosque. A piece of land was chosen and the price of the land was paid for by Abu Bakr. The Muslims, including Abu Bakr, constructed a mosque named Al-Masjid al-Nabawi at the site. Abu Bakr was paired with Khaarijah bin Zaid Ansari (who was from Medina) as a brother in faith. Abu Bakr&#x27;s relationship with Khaarijah was most cordial, which was further strengthened when Abu Bakr married Habiba, a daughter of Khaarijah. Khaarijah bin Zaid Ansari lived at Sunh, a suburb of Medina, and Abu Bakr also settled there. After Abu Bakr&#x27;s family arrived in Medina, he bought another house near Muhammad&#x27;s.

While the climate of Mecca was dry, the climate of Medina was damp and because of this, most of the migrants fell sick on arrival. Abu Bakr contracted a fever for several days, during which time he was attended to by Khaarijah and his family. In Mecca, Abu Bakr was a wholesale trader in cloth and he started the same business in Medina. He opened his new store at Sunh, and from there cloth was supplied to the market at Medina. Soon his business flourished. Early in 623, Abu Bakr&#x27;s daughter Aisha, who was already married to Muhammad, was sent on to Muhammad&#x27;s house after a simple marriage ceremony, further strengthening relations between Abu Bakr and Muhammad.

=== Military campaigns under Muhammad ===
===Battle of Badr===

In 624, Abu Bakr was involved in the first battle between the Muslims and the Quraysh of Mecca, known as the Battle of Badr, but did not fight, instead acting as one of the guards of Muhammad&#x27;s tent. In relation to this, Ali later asked his associates as to who they thought was the bravest among men. Everyone stated that Ali was the bravest of all men. Ali then replied:

In Sunni accounts, during one such attack, two discs from Abu Bakr&#x27;s shield penetrated into Muhammad&#x27;s cheeks. Abu Bakr went forward with the intention of extracting these discs but Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah requested he leave the matter to him, losing his two incisors during the process. In these stories subsequently Abu Bakr, along with other companions, led Muhammad to a place of safety.

===Battle of Uhud===

In 625, he participated in the Battle of Uhud, in which the majority of the Muslims were routed and he himself was wounded. Before the battle had begun, his son Abd al-Rahman, at that time still non-Muslim and fighting on the side of the Quraysh, came forward and threw down a challenge for a duel. Abu Bakr accepted the challenge but was stopped by Muhammad. In the second phase of the battle, Khalid ibn al-Walid&#x27;s cavalry attacked the Muslims from behind, changing a Muslim victory to defeat.

===Battle of the Trench===

In 627 he participated in the Battle of the Trench and also in the Invasion of Banu Qurayza. In the Battle of the Trench, Muhammad divided the ditch into a number of sectors and a contingent was posted to guard each sector. One of these contingents was under the command of Abu Bakr. The enemy made frequent assaults in an attempt to cross the ditch, all of which were repulsed. To commemorate this event a mosque, later known as &#x27;Masjid-i-Siddiq&#x27;, was constructed at the site where Abu Bakr had repulsed the charges of the enemy.

===Battle of Khaybar===

Abu Bakr took part in the Battle of Khaybar. Khaybar had eight fortresses, the strongest and most well-guarded of which was called Al-Qamus. Muhammad sent Abu Bakr with a group of warriors to attempt to take it, but they were unable to do so. Muhammad also sent Umar with a group of warriors, but Umar could not conquer Al-Qamus either. Some other Muslims also attempted to capture the fort, but they were unsuccessful as well. Finally, Muhammad sent Ali, who defeated the enemy leader, Marhab.

===Military campaigns during final years of Muhammad===
In 629 Muhammad sent &#x27;Amr ibn al-&#x27;As to Zaat-ul-Sallasal, followed by Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah in response to a call for reinforcements. Abu Bakr and Umar commanded an army under al-Jarrah, and they attacked and defeated the enemy.

In 630, when the Muslims conquered Mecca, Abu Bakr was part of the army. Before the conquest of Mecca his father Abu Quhafa converted to Islam.

====Battles of Hunayn and Ta&#x27;if====

In 630, the Muslim army was ambushed by archers from the local tribes as it passed through the valley of Hunayn, some eleven miles northeast of Mecca. Taken unaware, the advance guard of the Muslim army fled in panic. There was considerable confusion, and the camels, horses and men ran into one another in an attempt to seek cover. Muhammad, however, stood firm. Only nine companions remained around him, including Abu Bakr. Under Muhammad&#x27;s instruction, his uncle Abbas shouted at the top of his voice, &quot;O Muslims, come to the Prophet of Allah&quot;. The call was heard by the Muslim soldiers and they gathered beside Muhammad. When the Muslims had gathered in sufficient number, Muhammad ordered a charge against the enemy. In the hand-to-hand fight that followed the tribes were routed and they fled to Autas.

Muhammad posted a contingent to guard the Hunayn pass and led the main army to Autas. In the confrontation at Autas the tribes could not withstand the Muslim onslaught. Believing continued resistance useless, the tribes broke camp and retired to Ta&#x27;if.

Abu Bakr was commissioned by Muhammad to lead the attack against Ta&#x27;if. The tribes shut themselves in the fort and refused to come out in the open. The Muslims employed catapults, but without tangible result. The Muslims attempted to use a testudo formation, in which a group of soldiers shielded by a cover of cowhide advanced to set fire to the gate. However, the enemy threw red hot scraps of iron on the testudo, rendering it ineffective.

The siege dragged on for two weeks, and still there was no sign of weakness in the fort. Muhammad held a council of war. Abu Bakr advised that the siege might be raised and that God make arrangements for the fall of the fort. The advice was accepted, and in December 630, the siege of Ta&#x27;if was raised and the Muslim army returned to Mecca. A few days later Malik bin Auf, the commander, came to Mecca and became a Muslim.

===Abu Bakr as Amir al-Hajj===
In 630‚Äì631 (AH 9), Muhammad assigned Abu Bakr as the to lead around 300 pilgrims from Medina to Mecca. In 631 AD, Muhammad sent from Medina a delegation of three hundred Muslims to perform the Hajj according to the new Islamic way and appointed Abu Bakr as the leader of the delegation. The day after Abu Bakr and his party had left for the Hajj, Muhammad received a new revelation: Surah Tawbah, the ninth chapter of the Quran. It is related that when this revelation came, someone suggested to Muhammad that he should send news of it to Abu Bakr. Muhammad said that only a man of his house could proclaim the revelation.

Muhammad summoned Ali, and asked him to proclaim a portion of Surah Tawbah to the people on the day of sacrifice when they assembled at Mina. Ali went forth on Muhammad&#x27;s slit-eared camel, and overtook Abu Bakr. When Ali joined the party, Abu Bakr wanted to know whether he had come to give orders or to convey them. Ali said that he had not come to replace Abu Bakr as Amir-ul-Hajj, and that his only mission was to convey a special message to the people on behalf of Muhammad.

At Mecca, Abu Bakr presided at the Hajj ceremony, and Ali read the proclamation on behalf of Muhammad. The main points of the proclamation were:

#Henceforward the non-Muslims were not to be allowed to visit the Kaaba or perform the pilgrimage.
#No one should circumambulate the Kaaba naked.
#Polytheism was not to be tolerated. Where the Muslims had any agreement with the polytheists such agreements would be honoured for the stipulated periods. Where there were no agreements a grace period of four months was provided and thereafter no quarter was to be given to the polytheists.

From the day this proclamation was made a new era dawned, and Islam alone was to be supreme in Arabia.

===Expedition of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq===

Abu Bakr led one military expedition, the Expedition of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq, which took place in Najd, in July 628 (third month 7AH in the Islamic calendar). Abu Bakr led a large company in Nejd on the order of Muhammad. Many were killed and taken prisoner. The Sunni Hadith collection &quot;Sunan Abu Dawud&quot; mentions the event.

===Expedition of Usama bin Zayd===

In 632, during the final weeks of his life, Muhammad ordered an expedition into Syria to avenge the defeat of the Muslims in the Battle of Mu&#x27;tah some years previously. Leading the campaign was Usama ibn Zayd, whose father, Muhammad&#x27;s erstwhile adopted son Zayd ibn Harithah, had been killed in the earlier conflict. No more than twenty years old, inexperienced and untested, Usama&#x27;s appointment was controversial, becoming especially problematic when veterans such as Abu Bakr, Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah and Sa&#x27;d ibn Abi Waqqas were placed under his command. Nevertheless, the expedition was dispatched, though soon after setting off, news was received of Muhammad&#x27;s death, forcing the army to return to Medina. The campaign was not reengaged until after Abu Bakr&#x27;s ascension to the caliphate, at which point he chose to reaffirm Usama&#x27;s command, which ultimately led to its success.

=== Death of Muhammad ===
There are a number of traditions regarding Muhammad&#x27;s final days which have been used to reinforce the idea of the great friendship and trust which is existed between him and Abu Bakr. In one such episode, as Muhammad was nearing death, he found himself unable to lead prayers as he usually would. He instructed Abu Bakr to take his place, ignoring concerns from Aisha that her father was too emotionally delicate for the role. Abu Bakr subsequently took up the position, and when Muhammad entered the prayer hall one morning during Fajr prayers, Abu Bakr attempted to step back to let him to take up his normal place and lead. Muhammad, however, allowed him to continue. In a related incident, around this time, Muhammad ascended the pulpit and addressed the congregation, saying, &quot;God has given his servant the choice between this world and that which is with God and he has chosen the latter.&quot; Abu Bakr, understanding this to mean that Muhammad did not have long to live, responded &quot;Nay, we and our children will be your ransom.&quot; Muhammad consoled his friend and ordered that all the doors leading to the mosque be closed aside from that which led from Abu Bakr&#x27;s house, &quot;for I know no one who is a better friend to me than he.&quot;

Upon Muhammad&#x27;s death, the Muslim community was unprepared for the loss of its leader and many experienced a profound shock. Umar was particularly affected, instead declaring that Muhammad had gone to consult with God and would soon return, threatening anyone who would say that Muhammad was dead. Abu Bakr, having returned to Medina, calmed Umar by showing him Muhammad&#x27;s body, convincing him of his death. He then addressed those who had gathered at the mosque, saying, &quot;If anyone worships Muhammad, Muhammad is dead. If anyone worships God, God is alive, immortal&quot;, thus putting an end to any idolising impulse in the population. He then concluded with verses from the Quran: &quot;(O Muhammad) Verily you will die, and they also will die.&quot; (), &quot;Muhammad is no more than an Apostle; and indeed many Apostles have passed away, before him, If he dies Or is killed, will you then Turn back on your heels? And he who turns back On his heels, not the least Harm will he do to Allah And Allah will give reward to those Who are grateful.&quot; ()

==Caliphate==

=== Saqifa ===
In the immediate aftermath of Muhammad&#x27;s death, a gathering of the Ansar took place in the (courtyard) of the Banu Sa&#x27;ida clan. The general belief at the time was that the purpose of the meeting was for the Ansar to decide on a new leader of the Muslim community among themselves, with the intentional exclusion of the Muhajirun (migrants from Mecca), though this has later become the subject of debate.

Nevertheless, Abu Bakr and Umar, upon learning of the meeting, became concerned of a potential coup and hastened to the gathering. Upon arriving, Abu Bakr addressed the assembled men with a warning that an attempt to elect a leader outside of Muhammad&#x27;s own tribe, the Quraysh, would likely result in dissension, as only they can command the necessary respect among the community. He then took Umar and Abu Ubaidah, by the hand and offered them to the Ansar as potential choices. Habab ibn Mundhir, a veteran from the battle of Badr, countered with his own suggestion that the Quraysh and the Ansar choose a leader each from among themselves, who would then rule jointly. The group grew heated upon hearing this proposal and began to argue amongst themselves. The orientalist William Muir gives the following observation of the situation:

Umar hastily took Abu Bakr&#x27;s hand and swore his own allegiance to the latter, an example followed by the gathered men. The meeting broke up when a violent scuffle erupted between Umar and the chief of the Banu Sa&#x27;ida, Sa&#x27;d ibn Ubadah. This event suggests that the choice of Abu Bakr was not unanimous, with emotions running high as a result of the disagreement.

Abu Bakr was near-universally accepted as head of the Muslim community (under the title of Caliph) as a result of Saqifah, though he did face contention because of the rushed nature of the event. Several companions, most prominent among them being Ali ibn Abi Talib, initially refused to acknowledge his authority. Among Shi&#x27;ites, it is also argued that Ali had previously been appointed as Muhammad&#x27;s heir, with the election being seen as in contravention to the latter&#x27;s wishes. Abu Bakr later sent Umar to confront Ali, resulting in an altercation which may have involved violence. However, after six months the group made peace with Abu Bakr and Ali offered him his allegiance.

=== Accession ===
After assuming the office of Caliph, Abu Bakr&#x27;s first address was as follows:

Abu Bakr&#x27;s reign lasted for 27 months, during which he crushed the rebellion of the Arab tribes throughout the Arabian Peninsula in the successful Ridda wars. In the last months of his rule, he sent Khalid ibn al-Walid on conquests against the Sassanid Empire in Mesopotamia and against the Byzantine Empire in Syria. This would set in motion a historical trajectory (continued later on by Umar and Uthman ibn Affan) that in just a few short decades would lead to one of the largest empires in history. He had little time to pay attention to the administration of state, though state affairs remained stable during his Caliphate. On the advice of Umar and Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah, he agreed to draw a salary from the state treasury and discontinue his cloth trade.

===Ridda wars===
Troubles emerged soon after Abu Bakr&#x27;s succession, with several Arab tribes launching revolts, threatening the unity and stability of the new community and state. These insurgencies and the caliphate&#x27;s responses to them are collectively referred to as the Ridda wars (&quot;Wars of Apostasy&quot;).

The opposition movements came in two forms. One type challenged the political power of the nascent caliphate as well as the religious authority of Islam with the acclamation of rival ideologies, headed by political leaders who claimed the mantle of prophethood in the manner that Muhammad had done. These rebellions include:
*that of the Banu Asad ibn Khuzaymah headed by Tulayha ibn Khuwaylid
*that of the Banu Hanifa headed by Musaylimah
*those from among the Banu Taghlib and the Bani Tamim headed by Sajah
*that of the Al-Ansi headed by Al-Aswad Al-Ansi
These leaders are all denounced in Islamic histories as &quot;false prophets&quot;.

The second form of opposition movement was more strictly political in character. Some of the revolts of this type took the form of tax rebellions in Najd among tribes such as the Banu Fazara and Banu Tamim. Other dissenters, while initially allied to the Muslims, used Muhammad&#x27;s death as an opportunity to attempt to restrict the growth of the new Islamic state. They include some of the Rabƒ´ øa in Bahrayn, the Azd in Oman, as well as among the Kindah and Khawlan in Yemen.

Abu Bakr, likely understanding that maintaining firm control over the disparate tribes of Arabia was crucial to ensuring the survival of the state, suppressed the insurrections with military force. He dispatched Khalid ibn Walid and a body of troops to subdue the uprisings in Najd as well as that of Musaylimah, who posed the most serious threat. Concurrent to this, Shurahbil ibn Hasana and Al-Ala&#x27;a Al-Hadrami were sent to Bahrayn, while Ikrimah ibn Abi Jahl, Hudhayfah al-Bariqi and Arfaja al-Bariqi were instructed to conquer Oman. Finally, Al-Muhajir ibn Abi Umayya and Khalid ibn Asid were sent to Yemen to aid the local governor in re-establishing control. Abu Bakr also made use of diplomatic means in addition to military measures. Like Muhammad before him, he used marriage alliances and financial incentives to bind former enemies to the caliphate. For instance, a member of the Banu Hanifa who had sided with the Muslims was rewarded with the granting of a land estate. Similarly, a Kindah rebel named Al-Ash&#x27;ath ibn Qays, after repenting and re-joining Islam, was later given land in Medina as well as the hand of Abu Bakr&#x27;s sister Umm Farwa in marriage.

At their heart, the Ridda movements were challenges to the political and religious supremacy of the Islamic state. Through his success in suppressing the insurrections, Abu Bakr had in effect continued the political consolidation which had begun under Muhammad&#x27;s leadership with relatively little interruption. By wars&#x27; end, he had established an Islamic hegemony over the entirety of the Arabian Peninsula.

===Expeditions into Persia and Syria===
With Arabia having united under a single centralised state with a formidable military, the region could now be viewed as a potential threat to the neighbouring Byzantine and Sasanian empires. It may be that Abu Bakr, reasoning that it was inevitable that one of these powers would launch a pre-emptive strike against the youthful caliphate, decided that it was better to deliver the first blow himself. Regardless of the caliph&#x27;s motivations, in 633, small forces were dispatched into Iraq and Palestine, capturing several towns. Though the Byzantines and Sassanians were certain to retaliate, Abu Bakr had reason to be confident; the two empires were militarily exhausted after centuries of war against each other, making it likely that any forces sent to Arabia would be diminished and weakened.

A more pressing advantage though was the effectiveness of the Muslim fighters as well as their zeal, the latter of which was partially based on their certainty of the righteousness of their cause. Additionally, the general belief among the Muslims was that the community must be defended at all costs. Historian Theodor N√∂ldeke gives the somewhat controversial opinion that this religious fervour was intentionally used to maintain the enthusiasm and momentum of the &quot;ummah&quot;:

Though Abu Bakr had started these initial conflicts which eventually resulted in the Islamic conquests of Persia and the Levant, he did not live to see those regions conquered by Islam, instead leaving the task to his successors.

===Preservation of the Quran===

Abu Bakr was instrumental in preserving the Quran in written form. It is said that after the hard-won victory over Musaylimah in the Battle of Yamama in 632, Umar saw that some five hundred of the Muslims who had memorised the Quran had been killed in wars. Fearing that it might become lost or corrupted, Umar requested that Abu Bakr authorise the compilation and preservation of the scriptures in written format. The caliph was initially hesitant, being quoted as saying, &quot;how can we do that which the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless and keep him, did not himself do?&quot; He eventually relented, however, and appointed Zayd ibn Thabit, who had previously served as one of the scribes of Muhammad, for the task of gathering the scattered verses. The fragments were recovered from every quarter, including from the ribs of palm branches, scraps of leather, stone tablets and &quot;from the hearts of men&quot;. The collected work was transcribed onto sheets and verified through comparison with Quran memorisers. The finished codex, termed the &quot;Mus&#x27;haf&quot;, was presented to Abu Bakr, who prior to his death, bequeathed it to his successor Umar. Upon Umar&#x27;s own death, the &quot;Mus&#x27;haf&quot; was left to his daughter Hafsa, who had been one of the wives of Muhammad. It was this volume, borrowed from Hafsa, which formed the basis of Uthman&#x27;s legendary prototype, which became the definitive text of the Quran. All later editions are derived from this original.

==Death==

On 23 August 634, Abu Bakr fell sick and did not recover. He developed a high fever and was confined to bed. His illness was prolonged, and when his condition worsened, he felt that his end was near. Realising this, he sent for Ali and requested him to perform his ghusl since Ali had also done it for Muhammad.

Abu Bakr felt that he should nominate his successor so that the issue should not be a cause of dissension among the Muslims after his death, though there was already controversy over Ali not having been appointed. He appointed Umar for this role after discussing the matter with some companions. Some of them favoured the nomination and others disliked it, due to the tough nature of Umar.

Abu Bakr thus dictated his last testament to Uthman ibn Affan as follows:
Umar led the funeral prayer for him and he was buried beside the grave of Muhammad.

==Appearance==
The historian Al-Tabari, in regards to Abu Bakr&#x27;s appearance, records the following interaction between Aisha and her paternal nephew, Abd Allah ibn Abd al-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr:
When she was in her howdah and saw a man from among the Arabs passing by, she said, &quot;I have not seen a man more like Abu Bakr than this one.&quot; We said to her, &quot;Describe Abu Bakr.&quot; She said, &quot;A slight, white man, thin-bearded and bowed. His waist wrapper would not hold but would fall down around his loins. He had a lean face, sunken eyes, a bulging forehead, and trembling knuckles.&quot;
Referencing another source, Al-Tabari further describes him as being &quot;white mixed with yellowness, of good build, slight, 
bowed, thin, tall like a male palm tree, hook-nosed, lean-faced, sunken-eyed, thin-shanked, and strong-thighed. He used to dye himself with henna and black dye.&quot;

==Assessment and legacy==
Though the period of his caliphate covers only two years, two months and fifteen days, it included successful invasions of the two most powerful empires of the time: the Sassanid Empire and Byzantine Empire. He is known as &quot;Al-Siddiq, Atiq&quot; and &quot;Companion of the Cave.&quot;

Abu Bakr had the distinction of being the first Caliph in the history of Islam and also the first Caliph to nominate a successor. He was the only Caliph in the history of Islam who refunded to the state treasury at the time of his death the entire amount of the allowance that he had drawn during the period of his caliphate. He has the distinction of purchasing the land for Al-Masjid al-Nabawi.

===Sunni view===
Sunni Muslim tradition considers Abu Bakr the best men after the prophets in Sunni Islam. They also consider Abu Bakr as one of the Ten Promised Paradise (&quot;al-‚ÄòAshara al-Mubashshara&quot;) whom Muhammad had testified were destined for Paradise. He is regarded as the &quot;Successor of Allah&#x27;s Messenger&quot; (&quot;Khalifa Rasulullah&quot;), and first of the Rightly Guided Caliphs‚Äîi.e. Rashidun‚Äîand as the rightful successor to Muhammad. Abu Bakr had always been the closest friend and confidant of Muhammad throughout his life, being beside Muhammad at every major event. It was Abu Bakr&#x27;s wisdom that Muhammad always honored. Abu Bakr is regarded among the best of Muhammad&#x27;s followers; as Umar ibn al-Khattab stated, &quot;If the faith of Abu Bakr was weighed against the faith of the people of the earth, the faith of Abu Bakr would outweigh the others.&quot;

===Shia view===
Shia Muslims believe that Ali ibn Abi Talib was supposed to assume the leadership, and that he had been publicly and unambiguously appointed by Muhammad as his successor at Ghadir Khumm. It is also believed that Abu Bakr and Umar conspired to take over power in the Muslim nation after Muhammad&#x27;s death, in a coup d&#x27;√©tat against Ali.

Most Twelver Shia (as the main branch of Shia Islam, with 85% of all Shias) have a negative view of Abu Bakr because, after Muhammad&#x27;s death, Abu Bakr refused to grant Muhammad&#x27;s daughter, Fatimah, the lands of the village of Fadak which she claimed her father had given to her as a gift before his death. He refused to accept the testimony of her witnesses, so she claimed the land would still belong to her as inheritance from her deceased father. However, Abu Bakr replied by saying that Muhammad had told him that the prophets of God do not leave as inheritance any worldly possessions and on this basis he refused to give her the lands of Fadak. However, as Sayed Ali Asgher Razwy notes in his book &quot;A Restatement of the History of Islam &amp; Muslims&quot;, Muhammad inherited a maid servant, five camels, and ten sheep. Shia Muslims believe that prophets can receive inheritance, and can pass on inheritance to others as well. In addition, Shias claim that Muhammad had given Fadak to Fatimah during his lifetime, and Fadak was therefore a gift to Fatimah, not inheritance. This view has also been supported by the Abbasid ruler al-Ma&#x27;mun.

Twelvers also accuse Abu Bakr of participating in the burning of the house of Ali and Fatima. The Twelver Shia believe that Abu Bakr sent Khalid ibn Walid to crush those who were in favour of Ali&#x27;s caliphate (&quot;see Ridda wars&quot;). The Twelver Shia strongly contest the idea that Abu Bakr or Umar were instrumental in the collection or preservation of the &quot;Quran&quot;, claiming that they should have accepted the copy of the book in the possession of Ali.

However, Sunnis argue that Ali and Abu Bakr were not enemies and that Ali named his sons Abi Bakr in honor of Abu Bakr. After the death of Abu Bakr, Ali raised Abu Bakr&#x27;s son Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr. The Twelver Shia view Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr as one of the greatest companions of Ali. When Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr was killed by the Umayyads, Aisha, the third wife of Muhammad, raised and taught her nephew Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr. Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr&#x27;s mother was from Ali&#x27;s family and Qasim&#x27;s daughter Farwah bint al-Qasim was married to Muhammad al-Baqir and was the mother of Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq. Therefore, Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr was the grandson of Abu Bakr and the grandfather of Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq.

Zaydi Shias, the largest group amongst the Shia before the Safavid dynasty and currently the second-largest group (although its population is only about 5% of all Shia Muslims), believe that on the last hour of Zayd ibn Ali (the uncle of Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq), he was betrayed by the people in Kufa who said to him: &quot;May God have mercy on you! What do you have to say on the matter of Abu Bakr and Umar ibn al-Khattab?&quot; Zayd ibn Ali said, &quot;I have not heard anyone in my family renouncing them both nor saying anything but good about them...when they were entrusted with government they behaved justly with the people and acted according to the Quran and the Sunnah&quot;.

In a similar view, the Ismaili Shias under the leadership of the Aga Khans have also come to accept the caliphates of the first three caliphs, including that of Abu Bakr:

<text>Ambrogio Traversari, also referred to as Ambrose of Camaldoli (138620 October 1439), was an Italian monk and theologian who was a prime supporter of the papal cause in the 15th century. He is honored as a saint by the Camaldolese Order.

==Biography==
Traversari was born near Forl√¨, in the village of Portico di Romagna in 1386. At the age of 14 he entered the Camaldolese Order in the Monastery of St. Mary of the Angels in Florence, and soon acquired a reputation as a leading theologian and Hellenist. In his study of Greek literature his master was Emmanuel Chrysoloras. Traversari worked primarily as a scholar until he became prior general of the Order in 1431.

Traversari emerged as a leading advocate of papal primacy. This attitude he showed clearly when he attended the Council of Basel as legate of Pope Eugene IV and defended the primacy of the pope, calling upon the council not to &quot;rend asunder Christ&#x27;s seamless robe&quot;. He was next sent by Eugene to the Emperor Sigismund to ask his aid in the pope&#x27;s efforts to end this council, which for five years had been encroaching on papal prerogatives. Eugene transferred the council from Basel to Ferrara on 18 September 1437.

So strong was Traversari&#x27;s hostility to some of the delegates that he described Basel as a western Babylon. He likewise supported the pope at Ferrara and Florence, and worked hard in the attempt to reconcile the Eastern and Western Churches. But in this council, and later, in that of Florence, Traversari, by his efforts and charity toward some indigent Greek bishops, greatly helped to bring about a union of the two Churches, the decree for which, 6 July 1439, he was called on to prepare a draft.

Ambrose Traversari died soon after. His feastday is celebrated by the Camaldolese Order on 20 November.

==Character==
According to the author of his biography in the eleventh edition of the &quot;Encyclop√¶dia Britannica&quot;: &quot;Ambrose is interesting as typical of the new humanism which was growing up within the church. Thus while among his own colleagues he seemed merely a hypocritical and arrogant priest, in his relations with his brother humanists, such as Cosimo de&#x27; Medici, he appeared as the student of classical antiquities and especially of Greek theological authors&quot;.

==Works==
His works include a treatise on the Holy Eucharist, one on the Procession of the Holy Spirit, many lives of saints, as well as a history of his term as prior general of the Camaldolese. He also translated from Greek into Latin a life of John Chrysostom (Venice, 1533); the &quot;Spiritual Wisdom&quot; of John Moschus; &quot;The Ladder of Divine Ascent&quot; of John Climacus (Venice, 1531), P.G., LXXXVIII. Between 1424 and 1433 he worked on the translation of the &quot;Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers&quot; by Diogenes La√´rtius, which came to be widely circulated in manuscript form. He also translated four books against the errors of the Greeks, by Manuel Kalekas, Patriarch of Constantinople, a Dominican friar (Ingolstadt, 1608), P.G., CLII, col. 13-661, a work known only through Ambrose&#x27;s translation.

He also translated many homilies of John Chrysostom; the writings of Dionysius Areopagita (1436); Basil of Caesarea&#x27;s treatise on virginity; thirty-nine discourses of Ephrem the Syrian, and many other works of the Fathers and writers of the Greek Church. Jean Mabillon&#x27;s &quot;Letters and Orations of St. Ambrose of Camaldoli&quot; was published in Florence in 1759.

*&quot;Hodoeporicon&quot;, diary of a journey visiting the monasteries of Italy

<text>Ambrosians are members of one of the religious brotherhoods which at various times since the 14th century have sprung up in and around Milan, Italy. In the 16th century, a sect of Anabaptist Ambrosians was founded.

==Orders==
Only the oldest of the Catholic Ambrosians, the , had anything more than a very local significance. This order is known from a bull of Pope Gregory XI addressed to the monks of the church of St Ambrose outside Milan.

Saint Ambrose, Bishop of Milan, certainly did not found religious orders, though he took an interest in the monastic life and watched over its beginnings in his diocese, providing for the needs of a monastery outside the walls of Milan, as Saint Augustine recounts in his &quot;Confessions&quot;. Ambrose also made successful efforts to improve the moral life of women in the Milan of his time by promoting the permanent institution of Virgins, as also of widows. His exhortations and other interventions have survived in various writings:
* 
* 
* 
Ambrose was the only Father of the Church to leave behind so many writings on the subject and his attentions naturally enough led to the formation of communities which later became formal monasteries of women.

It is against this background that two religious orders or congregations‚Äîone of men and one of women, when founded in the Milan area during the 13th and 15th centuries‚Äîtook Saint Ambrose as their patron and hence adopted his name.

===Order of St Ambrose===
The first of the groups to adopt the name of St Ambrose was formed in a cave in a wood (Latin nemus, a term later used in their name) outside Milan by three rich Milanese nobles, Alessandro Crivelli, Antonio Petrasancta, and Alberto Besozzo, who were joined by numerous others, including lay hermits and priests and came over time to adopt a cenobitic form of life. Their chosen initial locality was associated traditionally with St Ambrose. In 1375 Pope Gregory XI approved them as an order with the obligation of following the Rule of St Augustine, and celebration the liturgy according to the Ambrosian Rite. Initially the various houses founded were quasi autonomous and had no formal bond between them. Subsequently Pope Eugene IV, in a bull of 4 October 1441, formed them into an order on the mendicant model, with the name &quot;Fratres Sancti Ambrosii ad Nemus&quot; The brethren were ruled by a rector general, elected by a general chapter meeting every three years, and assisted in his duties by two &quot;visitors&quot;. Upon election the rector general was instituted by the Archbishop of Milan. The friars wore a habit consisting of a brown tunic, scapular, and hood. The priests of the congregation undertook preaching and other tasks of the ministry but were not allowed to accept the charge of parishes. The original house adjacent to the then Milanese church of San Primo was constituted as the order&#x27;s main seat. There was another important house at Parabiago, a town located to the North West of Milan, and outside the Milan diocese only two other houses existed, both in Rome: San Clemente and San Pancrazio. 

In 1579 Saint Charles Borromeo, Archbishop of Milan, successfully reformed their discipline, which had grown lax. In 1589 Pope Sixtus V united to the Congregation of St Ambrose the houses of a group known as the &quot;Brothers of the Apostles of the Poor Life&quot; (or &quot;Apostolini&quot; or &quot;Brothers of St. Barnabas&quot;), whose houses were located in the province of Genoa and in the March of Ancona. This was an order that had been founded by Giovanni Scarpa at the end of the 15th century. The union was confirmed by Pope Paul V in 1606, at which time the congregation added the name of St. Barnabas to its title, adopted new constitutions and divided its houses into four provinces. Two of these, were in effect the two communities in Rome already mentioned, San Clemente and San Pancrazio. 

Published works have survived from the pen of Ascanio Tasca and Michele Mulozzani, each of whom was superior-general, and of Zaccaria Visconti, Francesco-Maria Guazzi and Paolo Fabulotti. Although various Ambrosians were given the title of Blessed in recognition of their holiness: Antonio Gonzaga of Mantua, Filippo of Fermo, and Gerardo of Monza, the order was eventually dissolved by Pope Innocent X in 1650.

===Nuns===
The Nuns of St Ambrose (Ambrosian Sisters) wore a habit of the same colour as the Brothers of St Ambrose, conformed to their constitutions, and followed the Ambrosian Rite, but were independent in government. Pope Sixtus IV gave the nuns canonical status in 1474. Their one monastery was on the top of Monte Varese, near Lago Maggiore, on the spot where their foundress, the Blessed Catarina Morigia (or Catherine of Palanza), had first led a solitary life. Other early nuns were the Blessed Juliana of Puriselli, Benedetta Bimia, and Lucia Alciata. The nuns were esteemed by St Charles Borromeo.

Another group of cloistered &quot;Nuns of St Ambrose&quot;, also called the Annunciatae (Italian: &quot;Annunziate&quot;) of Lombardy or &quot;Sisters of St Marcellina&quot;, were founded in 1408 by three young women of Pavia, Dorothea Morosini, Eleonora Contarini, and Veronica Duodi. Their houses, scattered throughout Lombardy and Venetia, were united into a congregation by St Pius V, under the Rule of St Augustine with a mother-house, residence of the prioress general, at Pavia. One of the nuns in this group was Saint Catharine Fieschi Adorno, who died on September 14, 1510.

===Oblates of St. Ambrose and of St. Charles===

In some sense also &quot;Ambrosians&quot; are the members of a diocesan religious society founded by St Charles Borromeo, Archbishop of Milan. All priests or destined to become priests, they took a simple vow of obedience to their bishop. The model for this was a society that already existed at Brescia, under the name of &quot;Priests of Peace&quot;. In August 1578 the new society was inaugurated, being entrusted with the church of the Holy Sepulchre and given the name of &quot;Oblates of St. Ambrose.&quot; They later received the approbation of Gregory XIII. St Charles died in 1584. These Oblates were dispersed by Napoleon I in 1810, while another group called the Oblates of Our Lady of Rho escaped this fate. In 1848 they were reorganized and given the name of &quot;Oblates of St. Charles&quot; and reassigned the house of the Holy Sepulchre. In the course of the 19th century similar groups were founded in a number of countries, including the &quot;Oblates of St Charles&quot;, established in London by Cardinal Nicholas Wiseman.

<text>Ambrosiaster or Pseudo-Ambrose is the name given to the unknown author of a commentary on the epistles of Saint Paul, written some time between 366 and 384AD. The name &quot;Ambrosiaster&quot; in Latin means &quot;would-be Ambrose&quot;. Various conjectures have been made as to Ambrosiaster&#x27;s true identity, and several other works have been attributed to the same author, with varying degrees of certainty.

== Identity ==
Pseudo-Ambrose was the name given by Erasmus to refer to the author of a volume containing the first complete Latin commentary on the Pauline epistles. 

Attempts to identify Ambrosiaster with known authors has continued, but with no success. Because Augustine cites Ambrosiaster&#x27;s commentary on Romans 5:12 under the name of &quot;Hilary&quot;, many critics have attempted to identify Ambroasiaster with one of the many writers named &quot;Hilary&quot; active in the period. In 1899, Germain Morin suggested that the writer was Isaac, a converted Jew and writer of a tract on the Trinity and Incarnation, who was exiled to Spain in 378‚Äì380 and then relapsed to Judaism. Morin afterwards abandoned this theory of the authorship in favour of Decimus Hilarianus Hilarius, proconsul of Africa in 377. Alternatively, Paolo Angelo Ballerini attempted to sustain the traditional attribution of the work to Ambrose, in his complete edition of that Father&#x27;s work. This is extremely problematic, though, since it would require Ambrose to have written the book before he became a bishop, and then added to it in later years, incorporating later remarks of Hilary of Poitiers on Romans. No identifications, therefore, have acquired lasting popularity with scholars, and Ambrosiaster&#x27;s identity remains a mystery.

Internal evidence from the documents has been taken to suggest that the author was active in Rome during the period of Pope Damasus, and, almost certainly, a member of the clergy.

==Works==
===Commentary on Paul===
The &quot;Commentary on Thirteen Pauline Letters&quot; is considered valuable as evidence of the state of the Latin text of Paul&#x27;s epistles before the appearance of the Vulgate of Jerome, and as an example of Pauline interpretation prior to Augustine of Hippo. It was traditionally ascribed to Ambrose, but in 1527, Erasmus threw doubt on the accuracy of this ascription, and the anonymous author came to be known as &quot;Ambrosiaster&quot;. It was once thought that Erasmus coined this name; however, Ren√© Hoven, in 1969, showed that this was incorrect, and that credit should actually be given to the Maurists. Later scholars have followed Hoven in this assessment, although it has also been suggested that the name originated with Franciscus Lucas Brugensis.

===Other works===
Several other works which now survive only as fragments have been attributed to this same author. These include a commentary on Matthew 24, and discussions on the parable of the leaven, the denial of Peter, and Jesus&#x27;s arrest. In 1905, Alexander Souter established that Ambrosiaster was also the author of the &quot;Quaestiones Veteris et Novi Testamenti,&quot; a lengthy collection of exegetical and polemical tractates which manuscripts have traditionally ascribed to Augustine.

Other works ascribed to the same author, less definitely, are the &quot;Lex Dei sive Mosaicarum et Romanorum legum collatio&quot;, &quot;De bello judaico&quot;, and the fragmentary &quot;Contra Arianos&quot; sometimes ascribed to the pseudo-Hilary and the &quot;sermo 246&quot; of pseudo-Augustine. They mention Simon Magus.

==Influence==
Many scholars argue that Ambrosiaster&#x27;s works were essentially Pelagian, although this is disputed. Pelagius cited him extensively. For example, Alfred Smith argued that Pelagius got his views on predestination and original sin from Ambrosiaster. However, Augustine also made use of Ambrosiaster&#x27;s commentaries.

<doc id="1719" wikidata="Q459606" url="?curid=1719" title="Ambrosius Aurelianus">
<text>Ambrosius Aurelianus (; Anglicised as Ambrose Aurelian and called Aurelius Ambrosius in the &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; and elsewhere) was a war leader of the Romano-British who won an important battle against the Anglo-Saxons in the 5th century, according to Gildas. He also appeared independently in the legends of the Britons, beginning with the 9th-century &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;. Eventually, he was transformed by Geoffrey of Monmouth into the uncle of King Arthur, the brother of Arthur&#x27;s father Uther Pendragon, as a ruler who precedes and predeceases them both. He also appears as a young prophet who meets the tyrant Vortigern; in this guise, he was later transformed into the wizard Merlin.

==According to Gildas==
Ambrosius Aurelianus is one of the few people whom Gildas identifies by name in his sermon &quot;De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae&quot;, and the only one named from the 5th century. &quot;De Excidio&quot; is considered the oldest extant British document about the so-called Arthurian period of Sub-Roman Britain. Following the destructive assault of the Saxons, the survivors gather together under the leadership of Ambrosius, who is described as:

Ambrosius was possibly of high birth and very likely a Christian: Gildas says that he won his battles &quot;with God&#x27;s help&quot;. Ambrosius&#x27;s parents were slain by the Saxons and he was among the few survivors of their initial invasion.

According to Gildas, Ambrosius organised the survivors into an armed force and achieved the first military victory over the Saxon invaders. However, this victory was not decisive: &quot;Sometimes the Saxons and sometimes the citizens [meaning the Romano-British inhabitants] were victorious.&quot; Due to Gildas&#x27;s description of him, Ambrosius is one of the figures called the Last of the Romans.

===Scholarship questions===
Two points in Gildas&#x27;s description have attracted much scholarly commentary. The first is what Gildas meant by saying Ambrosius&#x27; family &quot;had worn the purple&quot;. Roman emperors and male Patricians wore clothes with a purple band to denote their class so the reference to purple may be to an aristocratic heritage. Roman military tribunes (&quot;tribuni militum&quot;), senior officers in Roman legions, wore a similar purple band so the reference may be to a family background of military leadership. The tradition was old, as the togas and pallia of already ancient senators and tribunes were trimmed with the purple band. In the church, &quot;the purple&quot; is a euphemism for blood and therefore &quot;wearing the purple&quot; may be a reference to martyrdom or a bishop&#x27;s robe. In addition, in the later Roman Empire both Roman consuls and governors of consular rank also wore clothes with a purple fringe. The &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot;, a Roman catalogue of official posts, lists four or five provincial governors in Roman Britain and two of them were of consular rank. One was the governor of Maxima Caesariensis and the other that of Valentia. The parent who wore the purple may well have been one of these governors, whose names were not recorded.

It has been suggested by historian Alex Woolf that Ambrosius may have been related to the 5th-century Romano-British usurpers Marcus or Gratian ‚Äì Woolf expresses a preference based on nomenclature for Marcus. Frank D. Reno, an Arthurian scholar, has instead argued that the name &quot;Aurelianus&quot; indicates the descent of Ambrosius from the Illyrian Roman emperor Aurelian (reigned 270‚Äì275). Aurelian&#x27;s military campaigns included the conquest of the Gallic Empire. N. J. Higham suggests that Ambrosius may have been distantly related to imperial families of the late Roman Empire, such as the Theodosian dynasty. Branches of this particular dynasty were known to be active in western Roman provinces like Hispania.

Mike Ashley instead focuses on the name &quot;Ambrosius&quot; and its possible connection to Saint Ambrosius, a fourth-century Bishop of Milan, who also served as consular governor in areas of Roman Italy. The father of the Bishop is sometimes claimed to be a fourth century Praetorian prefect of Gaul named Aurelius Ambrosius, whose areas included Britain, though some modern scholars doubt that Saint Ambrosius was related to this man (instead identifying his father with an official named Uranius mentioned in an extract from the Theodosian Code). Ashley suggests that Ambrosius Aurelianus was related to the two Aurelii Ambrosii. Tim Venning points out that the name &quot;Aurelianus&quot; could be the result of a Roman adoption. When a boy was adopted into a new gens (clan), he received the family names of his new family but was often additionally called by a cognomen indicating his descent from his original family. The additional cognomen often had the form &quot;-anus&quot;. When Gaius Octavius from gens Octavia was adopted by his uncle Gaius Julius Caesar, he was often distinguished from his adoptive father by the addition &quot;Octavianus&quot;. In this case, Ambrosius may have been a member of gens Aurelia who was adopted by another gens/family.

The second question is the meaning of the word &quot;avita&quot;: Gildas could have meant &quot;ancestors&quot;, or intended it to mean more specifically &quot;grandfather&quot; ‚Äì thus indicating Ambrosius lived about a generation before the Battle of Badon. Lack of information prevents sure answers to these questions.

===Gildas&#x27;s motives===
N. J. Higham, author of a book on Gildas and the literary tropes that he used, has suggested that Gildas may have had considerable motive for drawing attention to Ambrosius. He was not attempting to write a historical biography of the man, according to Higham, but setting him as an example to his contemporaries. It was essential to the philosophy of Gildas that Briton leaders who achieved victory over the barbarians were only able to do so because of divine aid. And only those who had superior Christian virtues were deserving of this aid. Ambrosius Aurelianus was apparently known for at least one such victory over the barbarians. To fit him into his worldview, Gildas was almost required to feature the former warrior as a man of exceptional virtues and obedience to God. He was made to fit Gildas&#x27;s version of a model leader.

Higham also suggests that the Roman lineage of Ambrosius was highlighted for a reason. Gildas was apparently intentionally connecting him with the legitimate authority and military virtues of the Romans. He was also contrasting him with the subsequent Briton rulers whose reigns lacked in such legitimacy.

===Identifying historical figures===
Gildas is a primary source for the Battle of Badon, yet he never mentions the names of the combatants. It is not known if Ambrosius Aurelianus or his successors took part in the battle. The names of the Saxon leaders in the battle are not recorded.

The identities of Ambrosius&#x27;s descendants are unknown, since Gildas never identifies them by name. It is assumed that they were Gildas&#x27;s contemporaries and known to the author. Higham suggests that they were prominent figures of the time. Their lineage and identities were probably sufficiently familiar to his intended audience that they did not have to be named. The work portrays Ambrosius&#x27;s descendants as inferior to their ancestor as part of his criticism on rulers of his time, according to Higham. Those criticised were likely aware that the vitriol was intended for them, but probably would not challenge a work offering such a glowing report of their illustrious ancestor.

Mike Ashley suggests that the descendants of Ambrosius could include other people named by Gildas. He favours the inclusion in this category of one Aurelius Caninus (&quot;Aurelius the dog-like&quot;), whom Gildas accuses of parricide, fornication, adultery, and warmongering. His name &quot;Aurelius&quot; suggests Romano-British descent. The insulting nickname &quot;Caninus&quot; was probably invented by Gildas himself, who similarly insults other contemporary rulers. Due to the name used by Gildas, there are theories that this ruler was actually named Conan/Cynan/Kenan. Some identify him with Cynan Garwyn, a 6th-century King of Powys, though it is uncertain if he was a contemporary of Gildas or lived one or two generations following him. Another theory is that this ruler did not reign in Britain but in Brittany. Caninus, in this view, might be Conomor (&quot;Great Dog&quot;). Conomor is considered a likelier contemporary of Gildas. Conomor was likely from Domnon√©e, an area of Brittany controlled by British immigrants from Dumnonia. He might be remembered in British legend as Mark of Cornwall.

Gildas primarily describes the Saxons as barbarian raiders; their invasions involved a slow and difficult process of military conquest. By AD 500, possibly the time described by Gildas, Anglo-Saxons controlled the Isle of Wight, Kent, Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Suffolk, and coastal areas of Northumberland and Yorkshire. The rest of the former Roman Britain was still under the control of the local Britons or remnants of the Roman provincial administration. Gildas also mentions depopulation of cities and this probably reflects historical facts. Londinium, once a major city, was completely abandoned during the 5th century.

==According to Bede==
Bede follows Gildas&#x27;s account of Ambrosius in his &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;, but in his &quot;Chronica Majora&quot; he dates Ambrosius&#x27;s victory to the reign of the Emperor Zeno (474‚Äì491).

Bede&#x27;s treatment of the 5th century history of Great Britain is not particularly valuable as a source. Until about the year 418, Bede could choose between several historical sources and often followed the writings of Orosius. Following the end of Orosius&#x27;s history, Bede apparently lacked other available sources and relied extensively on Gildas. Entries from this period tend to be close paraphrases of Gildas&#x27;s account with mostly stylistic changes. Bede&#x27;s account of Ambrosius Aurelianus has been translated as following:

Bede does not mention the descendants of Ambrosius Aurelianus, nor their supposed degeneracy.

==According to Nennius==
The &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, attributed to Nennius, preserves several snippets of lore about Ambrosius. Despite the traditional attribution, the authorship of the work and the period of its writing are open questions for modern historians. There are several extant manuscript versions of the work, varying in details. The most important ones have been dated to between the 9th and the 11th century. Some modern scholars think it unlikely that the work was composed by a single writer or compiler, suggesting that it may have taken centuries to reach its final form, though this theory is not conclusive.

In Chapter 31, we are told that Vortigern ruled in fear of Ambrosius. This is the first mention of Ambrosius in the work. According to Frank D. Reno, this would indicate that Ambrosius&#x27;s influence was formidable, since Vortigern considered him more of a threat than northern invaders and attempts to restore Roman rule in Britain. The chapter relates events following the end of Roman rule in Britain and preceding Vortigern&#x27;s alliance with the Saxons.

The most significant appearance of Ambrosius is the story about Ambrosius, Vortigern, and the two dragons beneath Dinas Emrys, &quot;Fortress of Ambrosius&quot; in Chapters 40‚Äì42. In this account, Ambrosius is still an adolescent but has supernatural powers. He intimidates Vortigern and the royal magicians. When it is revealed that Ambrosius is the son of a Roman consul, Vortigern is convinced to cede to the younger man the castle of Dinas Emrys and all the kingdoms in the western part of Britain. Vortigern then retreats to the north, in an area called Gwynessi. This story was later retold with more detail by Geoffrey of Monmouth in his fictionalised &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, conflating the personage of Ambrosius with the Welsh tradition of Myrddin the visionary, known for oracular utterances that foretold the coming victories of the native Celtic inhabitants of Britain over the Saxons and the Normans. Geoffrey also introduces him into the &quot;Historia&quot; under the name Aurelius Ambrosius as one of three sons of Constantine III, along with Constans and Uther Pendragon.

In Chapter 48, Ambrosius Aurelianus is described as &quot;king among all the kings of the British nation&quot;. The chapter records that Pascent, the son of Vortigern, was granted rule over the regions of Buellt and Gwrtheyrnion by Ambrosius. Finally, in Chapter 66, various events are dated from a Battle of Guoloph (often identified with Wallop, ESE of Amesbury near Salisbury), which is said to have been between Ambrosius and Vitolinus. The author dates this battle as taking place 12 years from the reign of Vortigern.

It is not clear how these various traditions about Ambrosius relate to each other, or whether they come from the same tradition; it is very possible that these references are to different men with the same name. Frank D. Reno points out that the works call all these men &quot;Ambrosius&quot;/&quot;Emrys&quot;. The cognomen &quot;Aurelianus&quot; is never used. The &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; dates the battle of Guoloph to &quot;the twelfth year of Vortigern&quot;, by which the year 437 seems to be meant. This is perhaps a generation before the battle that Gildas may imply was commanded by Ambrosius Aurelianus.

The text never identifies who Ambrosius&#x27;s father is, just gives his title as a Roman consul. When an adolescent Ambrosius speaks of his father, there is no suggestion that this father is deceased. The boy is not identified as an orphan. The exact age of Ambrosius is not given in his one encounter with Vortigern. Frank D. Reno suggests that he might be as young as 13 years old, barely a teenager.

It is impossible to know to what degree Ambrosius actually wielded political power, and over what area. Ambrosius and Vortigern are shown as being in conflict in the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, and some historians have suspected that this preserves a historical core of the existence of two parties in opposition to one another, one headed by Ambrosius and the other by Vortigern. J. N. L. Myres built upon this suspicion and speculated that belief in Pelagianism reflected an actively provincial outlook in Britain and that Vortigern represented the Pelagian party, while Ambrosius led the Catholic one. Subsequent historians accepted Myres&#x27;s speculation as fact, creating a narrative of events in 5th century Britain with various degrees of elaborate detail. Yet a simpler alternative interpretation of the conflict between these two figures is that the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; is preserving traditions hostile to the purported descendants of Vortigern, who at this time were a ruling house in Powys. This interpretation is supported by the negative character of all of the stories retold about Vortigern in the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, which include his alleged practice of incest.

The identity of Ambrosius&#x27;s last mentioned enemy, Vitalinus, is somewhat obscure. Various manuscripts of the &quot;Historia&quot; and translations also render his name as &quot;Guitolin&quot;, &quot;Guitolini&quot;, and &quot;Guitholini&quot;. He is mentioned in chapter 49 as one of four sons of Gloiu and co-founder of the city of Gloucester. No other background information is given. There are theories that Gloiu is also the father of Vortigern, but the genealogy is obscure and no supporting primary text can be found. There have been further attempts to identify Vitalinus with a pro-Vortigern or anti-Roman faction in Britain, opposed to the rise of the Romano-British Ambrosius. However, this is rendered problematic since Vitalinus seems to also have a Romano-British name. The traditional view of pro-Roman and pro-Briton factions active in this period might oversimplify a more complex situation.

==According to William of Malmesbury==

Ambrosius appears briefly in the &quot;Gesta Regum Anglorum&quot; (&quot;Deeds of the Kings of the English&quot;) by William of Malmesbury. Despite its name, the work attempted to reconstruct British history in general by drawing together the varying accounts of Gildas, Bede, Nennius, and various chroniclers. The work features Ambrosius as the apparent employer of Arthur. The relevant passage has been translated as follows:

William swiftly shifts attention from Ambrosius to Arthur, and proceeds to narrate Arthur&#x27;s supposed victory in the Battle of Badon. The narrative is probably the first to connect Ambrosius and Arthur. William had to reconcile the accounts of Gildas and Bede who implied that Ambrosius was connected to the battle, and that of Nennius which clearly stated that it was Arthur who was connected to the battle. He solved the apparent discrepancy by connecting both of them to it. Ambrosius as the king of the Britons and Arthur as his most prominent general and true victor of the battle.

==According to Geoffrey of Monmouth==

Ambrosius Aurelianus appears in later pseudo-chronicle tradition beginning with Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; with the slightly garbled name &quot;Aurelius Ambrosius&quot;, now presented as son of a King Constantine. King Constantine&#x27;s eldest son Constans is murdered at Vortigern&#x27;s instigation, and the two remaining sons (Ambrosius and Uther, still very young) are quickly hustled into exile in Brittany. (This does not fit with Gildas&#x27; account, in which Ambrosius&#x27; family perished in the turmoil of the Saxon uprisings.) Later, the two brothers return from exile with a large army when Vortigern&#x27;s power has faded. They destroy Vortigern and become friends with Merlin. They go on to defeat the Saxon leader Hengist in two battles at Maisbeli (probably Ballifield, near Sheffield) and Cunengeburg. Hengist is executed and Ambrosius becomes king of Britain. However, he is poisoned by his enemies, and Uther succeeds him. The text identifies the poisoner as Eopa.

Judgements vary wildly of the value of Geoffrey as both a historian and a literary storyteller. He has been praised for giving us detailed information about an otherwise obscure period and possibly preserving information from lost sources, and condemned for an excessive use of artistic licence and possibly inventing stories wholecloth. 
 According to Frank D. Reno, whenever Geoffrey uses extant sources, the details in the text tend to be accurate. Assuming that he was also using sources lost to us, it may be difficult to decide which details are truthful. Reno suggests that &quot;individual judgements&quot; have to be made about various elements of his narrative.

Geoffrey changed the word &quot;Aurelianus&quot; to &quot;Aurelius&quot;, which is the name of a Roman gens. Geoffrey retains the story of Emrys and the dragons from Nennius, but identifies the figure with Merlin. Merlin is Geoffrey&#x27;s version of a historical figure known as Myrddin Wyllt. Myrddin is only mentioned once in the &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot;, at an entry dated to 573. The name of Merlin is given in Latin as Ambrosius Merlinus. &quot;Merlinus&quot; may have been intended as the agnomen of a Roman or Romano-British individual like Ambrosius.

Elements of Ambrosius Aurelianus, the traditional warrior king, are used by Geoffrey for other characters. Ambrosius&#x27; supposed supernatural powers are passed to Merlin. Geoffrey&#x27;s Aurelius Ambrosius rises to the throne but dies early, passing the throne to a previously unknown brother called Uther Pendragon. The role of warrior king is shared by Uther and his son Arthur.

Geoffrey also uses the character Gloiu, father of Vitalinus/Vitolinus, derived from Nennius. He names this character as a son of Claudius and appointed by his father as Duke of the Welsh. His predecessor as Duke is called Arvirargus. Assuming that Claudius and Arvirargus are supposed to be contemporaries, then this Claudius is the Roman emperor Claudius I (reigned 41‚Äì54). It seems unlikely that Claudius would have living grandsons in the 5th century, four centuries following his death. Reno suggests that Claudius II (reigned 268‚Äì270) would be a more likely &quot;Claudius&quot; to have living descendants in the 5th century.

Geoffrey for the first time gives a genealogy of Ambrosius. He is supposedly a paternal nephew of Aldroenus, King of Brittany, son of Constantine and an unnamed Briton noblewoman, adoptive grandson (on his mother&#x27;s side) of Guthelinus/Vitalinus, Bishop of London, younger brother of Constans and older brother of Uther Pendragon. Ambrosius and Uther are supposedly raised by their adoptive maternal grandfather Guthelinus/Vitalinus. It is not explicitly covered in Geoffrey&#x27;s narrative, but this genealogy makes Constantine and his children descendants of Conan Meriadoc, legendary founder of the line of Kings of Brittany. Conan is also featured in the &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, where he is appointed king by Roman emperor Magnus Maximus (reigned 383‚Äì388).

Constantine&#x27;s reign is placed by Geoffrey as following the Groans of the Britons mentioned by Gildas. Constantine is reported killed by a Pict and his reign is followed by a brief succession crisis. Candidates for the throne included all three sons of Constantine, but there were problems for their eventual rise to the throne. Constans was a monk, and Ambrosius and Uther were underage and still in their cradle. The crisis is resolved when Vortigern places Constans on the throne, and then serves as his chief adviser and power behind the throne. When Constans is killed by the Picts serving as bodyguards of Vortigern, Vortigern feigns anguish and has the killers executed. Ambrosius is still underage and Vortigern rises to the throne.

The chronology offered by Geoffrey for the early life of Ambrosius contradicts Gildas and Nennius, and is also internally inconsistent. The Groans of the Britons involves an appeal by the Britons to Roman consul &quot;Agitius&quot;. This person has been identified with Flavius Aetius (d. 454), magister militum (&quot;master of soldiers&quot;) of the Western Roman Empire and consul of the year 446. The Groans are generally dated to the 440s and 450s, preceding the death of Aetius. If Geoffrey&#x27;s Constantine rose to the throne immediately following the Groans, this would place his reign in this period. Geoffrey gives a 10-year reign for Constantine and his marriage lasts just as long. However the eldest son Constans is clearly older than 10 years by the time his father dies. He is already an adult candidate of the throne and has had time to follow a monastic career. Even assuming there is a time gap between the death of Constantine and the adulthood of Constans, his younger brothers 
have not aged at all in the narrative.
Geoffrey&#x27;s narrative has an underage Ambrosius, if not a literal infant, in the 460s. Accounts deriving from Gildas and Nennius place Ambrosius in the prime of his life in the same decade. Most telling is that Geoffrey has Vortigern rising to the throne in the 460s. Nennius places the rise of Vortigern in the year 425, and Vortigern is entirely absent in chronologies of the 460s. Suggesting that he was deceased by that time.

Geoffrey&#x27;s narrative includes as a major character Hengist, as leader of the Saxons. He is featured as the father of Queen Rowena and father-in-law of Vortigern. Other Saxon characters in the narrative tend to receive less attention by the writer, but their names tend to correspond to Anglo-Saxons known from other sources. Henginst&#x27;s supposed son Octa is apparently Octa of Kent, a 6th-century ruler variously connected to Hengist as a son or descendant. The other son, Ebissa, is more difficult to identify. He might correspond to kinsmen of Hengist variously identified as &quot;Ossa&quot;, &quot;Oisc&quot;, and &quot;Aesc&quot;. A minor Saxon character called &quot;Cherdic&quot; is probably Cerdic of Wessex, though elsewhere Geoffrey calls the same king &quot;Cheldric&quot;. He actually may appear under three different names in the narrative, since Geoffrey elsewhere calls the interpreter of Hengist &quot;Ceretic&quot;, a variant of the same name.

Geoffrey, in the last chapters featuring Vortigern, has the king served by magicians. This detail derives from Nennius, though Nennius was talking about Vortigern&#x27;s &quot;wise men&quot;. They may not have been magic users but advisers. Vortigern&#x27;s encounter with Emrys/Merlin takes place in this part of the narrative. Merlin warns Vortigern that Ambrosius and Uther have already sailed for Britain and are soon to arrive, apparently to claim his throne. Ambrosius soon arrives at the head of the army and is crowned king. He besieges Vortigern at the castle of &quot;Genoreu&quot;, which is identified with Nennius&#x27; &quot;Cair Guorthigirn&quot; (&quot;Fort Vortigern&quot;) and the hillfort at Little Doward. Ambrosius burns the castle down and Vortigern dies with it.

Having killed Vortigern, Ambrosius next turns his attention to Hengist. Despite the fact that no earlier military actions of Ambrosius are recorded, the Saxons have already heard of his bravery and battle prowess. They immediately retreat beyond the Humber. Hengist soon amasses a massive army to face Ambrosius. His army counts 200,000 men and Ambrosius&#x27; only 10,000 men. He marches south and the first battle between the two armies takes place in Maisbeli, where Ambrosius emerges the victor. It is unclear what location Geoffrey had in mind. Maisbeli translates to &quot;the field of Beli&quot;, and could be related to the Beli Mawr of Welsh legend and/or the Celtic god Belenus. Alternatively it could be a field where the Beltane festival was celebrated. Geoffrey could derive the name from a similar-sounding toponym. For example, Meicen of the Hen Ogledd (&quot;Old North&quot;), traditionally identified with Hatfield.

Following his defeat, Hengist retreats towards Cunungeburg. Geoffrey probably had in mind Conisbrough, not far from Hatfield. Ambrosius leads his army against the new position of the Saxons. The second battle is more evenly fought, and Hengist has a chance to achieve victory. However, Ambrosius receives reinforcements from Brittany and the tide of the battle turns in favour of the Britons. Hengist himself is captured by his old enemy Eldol, Consul of Gloucester and decapitated. Soon after the battle, the surviving Saxon leaders Octa and Eosa submit themselves to Ambrosius&#x27; rule. He pardons them and grants them an area near Scotland. The area is not named, but Geoffrey could be basing this on Bernicia, a real Anglo-Saxon kingdom covering areas in the modern borders of Scotland and England.

Geoffrey closely connects the deaths of Vortigern and Hengist, which are elsewhere poorly recorded. Vortigern historically died in the 450s, and various dates for the death of Hengist have been proposed, between the 450s and the 480s. Octa of Kent, the supposed son and heir of Hengist, was still alive in the 6th century and seems to belong to a later historical era than his father. The ruling family of the Kingdom of Kent were called the Oiscingas, a term identifying them as descendants of Oisc of Kent, not of Hengist. In effect, none of them was likely a literal son of Hengist and their relation to Hengist may have been a later invention. Geoffrey did not invent the connection, but his sources here were likely legendary in nature.

Following his victories and the end of the wars, Ambrosius organises the burial of killed nobles at Kaercaradduc. Geoffrey identifies this otherwise unknown location with Caer-Caradog (Salisbury). Ambrosius wants a permanent memorial for the slain and assigns the task to Merlin. The result is the so-called Giants&#x27; Ring. Its location in the vicinity of Salisbury has led to its identification with Stonehenge, though Geoffrey never uses that term. Stonehenge is closer to Amesbury than Salisbury. The ring formation of the monument could equally apply to Avebury, the largest stone circle in Europe.

==In other texts==

In Welsh legend and texts, Ambrosius appears as &quot;Emrys Wledig&quot; (Emperor Ambrose). The term &quot;Wledig&quot; is a title used by notable royal and military commanders. It is mostly used for famous figures such as Cunedda, and the Roman emperor Magnus Maximus (&quot;Macsen Wledig&quot;) when he appears in Welsh folklore.

In Robert de Boron&#x27;s &quot;Merlin&quot;, he is called simply &quot;Pendragon&quot; and his younger brother is named &quot;Uter&quot;, which he changes to &quot;Uterpendragon&quot; after the death of the elder sibling. This is probably a confusion that entered oral tradition from Wace&#x27;s &quot;Roman de Brut&quot;. Wace usually only refers to &quot;li roi&quot; (&quot;the king&quot;) without naming him, and someone has taken an early mention of Uther&#x27;s epithet &quot;Pendragon&quot; as the name of his brother.

Richard Carew&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Cornwall&quot; (1602) drew on an earlier French writer, Nicholas Gille, who mentions Moigne, brother of Aurelius and Uther, who was duke of Cornwall, and &quot;gouerner of the Realme&quot; under Emperor Honorius.

==Possible identification with other figures==

===Riothamus===
L√©on Fleuriot has suggested Ambrosius is identical to Riothamus, a Brythonic leader who fought a major battle against the Goths in France around the year 470. Fleuriot argues that Ambrosius led the Britons in the battle, in which he was defeated and forced to retreat to Burgundy. Fleuriot proposed that he then returned to Britain to continue the war against the Saxons.

==Place-name evidence==
It has been suggested that the place-name Amesbury in Wiltshire might preserve the name of Ambrosius, and that perhaps Amesbury was the seat of his power base in the later fifth century. Scholars such as Shimon Applebaum have found a number of place names through the Midland dialect regions of Britain that incorporate the &quot;ambre-&quot; element; examples include Ombersley in Worcestershire, Ambrosden in Oxfordshire, Amberley in Herefordshire, Amberley in Gloucestershire, and Amberley in West Sussex. These scholars have claimed that this element represents an Old English word &quot;amor&quot;, the name of a woodland bird. However, Amesbury in Wiltshire is in a different dialect region and does not easily fit into the pattern of the Midland dialect place names.

==Modern fictional treatments==
*The novel &quot;Coalescent&quot; by Stephen Baxter depicts Aurelianus as a general to Artorius, Briton and basis for the legend of King Arthur. In Baxter&#x27;s novel, Aurelianus is a minor character who interacts with the book&#x27;s main Roman-era protagonist, Regina, founder of a (literally) underground matriarchal society. In the text, he is credited with winning the battle of Mount Badon.
*In Marion Zimmer Bradley&#x27;s &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot;, Aurelianus is depicted as the ageing High King of Britain, a &quot;too-ambitious&quot; son of a Western Roman Emperor. His sister&#x27;s son is Uther Pendragon, but Uther is described as not having any Roman blood. Aurelianus is unable to gather the leadership of the native Celts, who refuse to follow any but their own race.
*In Alfred Duggan&#x27;s &quot;Conscience of the King&quot;, a historical novel about Cerdic, founder of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex, Ambrosius Aurelianus is a Romano-British general who rose independently to military power, forming alliances with various British kings and setting out to drive the invading Saxons from Britain. Cerdic, who is of both Germanic and British descent and raised as a Roman citizen, served in his army as a young man. In the novel Ambrosius is a separate character from Arthur, or Artorius, who appears much later as a foe of Cerdic.
*In Stephen R. Lawhead&#x27;s &quot;Pendragon Cycle&quot;, Aurelianus (most often referred to as &quot;Aurelius&quot;) figures prominently, along with his brother Uther, in the second book of the series, &quot;Merlin&quot;. He is poisoned soon after becoming High King of Britain, and Uther succeeds him. Lawhead alters the standard Arthurian story somewhat, in that he has Aurelius marry Igraine and become the true father of King Arthur (Uther does marry his brother&#x27;s widow, though).
*In Valerio Massimo Manfredi&#x27;s &quot;The Last Legion&quot;, Aurelianus (here called &quot;Aurelianus Ambrosius Ventidius&quot;) is a major character and is shown as one of the last loyal Romans, going to enormous lengths for his boy emperor Romulus Augustus, whose power has been wrested by the barbarian Odoacer. In this story, Romulus Augustus marries Igraine, and King Arthur is their son, and the sword of Julius Caesar becomes the legendary Excalibur in Britain. In the 2007 film version of the novel, he is played by Colin Firth and his name becomes &quot;Aurelianus Caius Antonius&quot;. In both he is called &quot;Aurelius&quot; for short.
*Mary Stewart&#x27;s &quot;The Crystal Cave&quot; follows Geoffrey of Monmouth in calling him Aurelius Ambrosius and portrays him as the father of Merlin, the elder brother of Uther (hence uncle of Arthur), an initiate of Mithras, and generally admired by everyone except the Saxons. Much of the book is set at his court in Brittany or during the campaign to retake his throne from Vortigern. Later books in the series show that Merlin&#x27;s attitude toward Arthur is influenced by his belief that Arthur is a reincarnation of Ambrosius, who is seen through Merlin&#x27;s eyes as a model of good kingship.
*In Rosemary Sutcliff&#x27;s &quot;The Lantern Bearers&quot; Prince Ambrosius Aurelianus of Arfon fights the Saxons by training his British army with Roman techniques and making effective use of cavalry. By the end of the novel, the elite cavalry wing is led by his nephew, a dashing young warrior prince named Artos, whom Sutcliff postulates to be the real Arthur. In the sequel &quot;Sword at Sunset&quot;, Artos eventually succeeds an ailing Ambrosius as High King after he deliberately gets himself killed while hunting.
*In Parke Godwin&#x27;s &quot;Firelord&quot;, Ambrosius is the elderly tribune of the diminished, dispirited and politically fractured Legio VI Victrix garrisoning Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. Near his death, he names Artorius Pendragon (Arthur) as his successor, encourages him to convert the legion to alae (heavy cavalry) and allows the legionnaires to renounce their loyalty to Rome and take personal oaths of fealty to Artorius in order to help unify Brittania politically and to create a military force with the ability to quickly redeploy to meet differing threats.
*In Jack Whyte&#x27;s &quot;Camulod Chronicles&quot;, Ambrosius Aurelianus is the half-brother of Caius Merlyn Britannicus (Merlin) and helps him lead the people of Camulod (Camelot).
*In Henry Treece&#x27;s &quot;The Great Captains&quot;, Ambrosius is the aged and blind Count of Britain who is deposed by the Celt Artos the Bear after the latter takes his sword of command Caliburn and plunges it into a tree stump, daring him to pull it out.
*In &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, Ambrosius and Arthur are one and the same. Merlin was an Ancient fleeing from Atlantis who later Ascends, then comes back in order to build the Sangraal, or Holy Grail, to defeat the Ori. Daniel Jackson also comments that it would mean that Ambrosius was 74 at the Battle of Mount Badon.
*Ambrosius (voiced by Owen Teale) is a major character in the 2020 Audible Original drama &quot;Albion: The Legend of Arthur&quot;, in which he is depicted as the uncle of Arthur and having a son named Cunan.

<text>Ammon (; Ammonite: ê§èê§åê§ç &quot; ªAmƒÅn&quot;; &#x27;; ) was an ancient [[Semitic languages|Semitic-speaking]] kingdom occupying the east of the [[Jordan River]], between the torrent valleys of [[Wadi Mujib|Arnon]] and [[Jabbok]], in present-day [[Jordan]]. The chief city of the country was &quot;Rabbah&quot; or &quot;Rabbat Ammon&quot;, site of the modern city of [[Amman]], Jordan&#x27;s capital. [[Milcom]] and [[Moloch|Molech]] are named in the [[Hebrew Bible]] as the gods of Ammon. The people of this kingdom are calledChildren of AmmonorAmmonites.

==History==

The Ammonites occupied the northern Central Trans-Jordanian Plateau from the latter part of the second millennium BC to at least the second century AD.

Ammon maintained its independence from the Neo-Assyrian Empire (10th to 7th centuries BC) by paying tribute to the Assyrian kings at a time when that Empire raided or conquered nearby kingdoms. The Kurkh Monolith lists the Ammonite king Baasha ben Ruhubi&#x27;s army as fighting alongside Ahab of Israel and Syrian allies against Shalmaneser III at the Battle of Qarqar in 853 BC, possibly as vassals of Hadadezer, the Aramaean king of Damascus. In 734 BC the Ammonite king Sanipu was a vassal of Tiglath-Pileser III of Assyria, and Sanipu&#x27;s successor Pudu-ilu held the same position under Sennacherib () and Esarhaddon (). An Assyrian tribute-list exists from this period, showing that Ammon paid one-fifth as much tribute as Judah did.

Somewhat later, the Ammonite king Amminadab I () was among the tributaries who suffered in the course of the great Arabian campaign of Assurbanipal. Other kings attested to in contemporary sources are Barachel (attested to in several contemporary seals) and Hissalel; Hissalel reigned about 620 BC, and is mentioned in an inscription on a bronze bottle found at Tel Siran in present-day Amman, along with his son, King Amminadab II, who reigned around 600 BC.

Archaeology and history indicate that Ammon flourished during the period of the Neo-Babylonian Empire (626 to 539 BC). This contradicts the view, dominant for decades, that Transjordan was either destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar II, or suffered a rapid decline following Judah&#x27;s destruction by that king. Newer evidence suggests that Ammon enjoyed continuity from the Neo-Babylonian to the Persian period of 550 to 330 BC. One reason includes Ammon becoming a Babylonian province, shortly after being devastated by Nebuchadnezzar II in the 580s BC.

In accounts in the First Book of Maccabees, the Ammonites and their neighboring tribes are noted for having resisted the revival of Jewish power under Judas Maccabaeus in the period 167 to 160 BC. The dynast Hyrcanus founded Qasr Al Abd, and was a descendant of the Seleucid Tobiad dynasty of Tobiah, whom Nehemiah mentions in the 5th century BC as an Ammonite (ii. 19) from the east-Jordanian district.

By the Roman conquest of the Levant by Pompey in 63 BC, Ammon lost its distinct identity through assimilation.

However, the last notice of the Ammonites occurs in Justin Martyr&#x27;s &quot;Dialogue with Trypho&quot; (¬ß 119), in the second century CE; Justin affirms that they were still a numerous people.

==Biblical account==
The first mention of the Ammonites in the Hebrew Bible is in Genesis 19:37-38. It is stated there that they descended from Ben-Ammi, a son of Lot with his younger daughter who plotted with her sister to intoxicate Lot and, in his inebriated state, have intercourse with him to become pregnant. Ben-Ammi literally means &quot;son of my people&quot;. After the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Lot&#x27;s daughters&#x27; plot resulted in them conceiving and giving birth to Ammon and his half-brother, Moab.

The Ammonites settled to the east of the Jordan, invading the Rephaim lands east of Jordan, between the Jabbok and Arnon, dispossessing them and dwelling in their place. Their territory originally comprising all from the Jordan to the wilderness, and from the River Jabbok south to the River Arnon. It was accounted a land of giants; and that giants formerly dwelt in it, whom the Ammonites called Zamzummim.

Shortly before the Israelite Exodus, the Amorites west of Jordan, under King Sihon, invaded and occupied a large portion of the territory of Moab and Ammon. The Ammonites were driven from the rich lands near the Jordan and retreated to the mountains and valleys to the east. The invasion of the Amorites created a wedge and separated the two kingdoms of Ammon and Moab.

Throughout the Bible, the Ammonites and the Israelites are portrayed as mutual antagonists. During the Exodus, the Israelites were prohibited by the Ammonites from passing through their lands. This mistreatment is one of the reasons given for why the Torah forbids Jewish women from marrying Ammonite men.

In the times of Judges, the Ammonites allied themselves with Eglon of Moab in attacking Israel. The Ammonites maintained their claim to part of Transjordan, after it was occupied by the Israelites who obtained it from Sihon. During the days of Jephthah, the Ammonites occupied the lands east of the River Jordan and started to invade Israelite lands west of the river. Jephthah became the leader in resisting these incursions.

The constant harassment of the Israelite communities east of the Jordan by the Ammonites was the impetus behind the unification of the tribes under Saul. King Nahash of Ammon (990 BC) lay siege to Jabesh-Gilead. Nahash appears abruptly as the attacker of Jabesh-Gilead, which lay outside the territory he laid claim to. Having subjected the occupants to a siege, the population sought terms for surrender, and were told by Nahash that they had a choice of death (by the sword) or having their right eyes gouged out. The population obtained seven days&#x27; grace from Nahash, during which they would be allowed to seek help from the Israelites, after which they would have to submit to the terms of surrender. The occupants sought help from the people of Israel, sending messengers throughout the whole territory, and Saul, a herdsman at this time, responded by raising an army which decisively defeated Nahash and his cohorts at Bezek.

The strangely cruel terms given by Nahash for surrender were explained by Josephus as being the &quot;usual practice&quot; of Nahash. A more complete explanation came to light with the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls: although not present in either the Septuagint or masoretic text, an introductory passage, preceding this narrative, was found in a copy of the Books of Samuel among the scrolls found in cave 4:
This eventually led to an alliance with Saul. Under his command, the Israelites relieved the siege and defeated the Ammonite king, eventually resulting in the formation of the Israelite kingdom.

During the reign of King David, the Ammonites humiliated David&#x27;s messengers, and hired the Aramean armies to attack Israel. This eventually ended in a war and a year-long siege of Rabbah, the capital of Ammon. The war ended with all the Ammonite cities being conquered and plundered, and the inhabitants being killed or put to forced labor at David&#x27;s command.

According to both 1 Kings 14:21-31 and 2 Chronicles 12:13, Naamah was an Ammonite. She was the only wife of King Solomon to be mentioned by name in the Tanakh as having borne a child. She was the mother of Solomon&#x27;s successor, Rehoboam.

When the Arameans of Damascus city-state deprived the Kingdom of Israel of their possessions east of the Jordan, the Ammonites became allies of Ben-hadad, and a contingent of 1,000 of them served as allies of Syria in the great battle of the Arameans and Assyrians at Qarqar in 854 BC in the reign of Shalmaneser III.

The Ammonites, Moabites and Meunim formed a coalition against Jehoshaphat of Judah. The coalition later was thrown to confusion, with the armies slaughtering one another. They were subdued and paid tribute to Jotham.

After submitting to Tiglath-Pileser III they were generally tributary to the Neo-Assyrian Empire. They joined in the general uprising that took place under Sennacherib; but they submitted and then became tributary in the reign of Esar-haddon. Their hostility to Judah is shown in their joining the Chaldeans to destroy it. Their cruelty is denounced by the prophet Amos and their destruction (with their return in the future) by Jeremiah; Ezekiel; and Zephaniah. Their murder of Gedaliah was a dastardly act. They may have regained their old territory when Tiglath-pileser carried off the Israelites east of the Jordan into captivity.

Tobiah the Ammonite united with Sanballat to oppose Nehemiah, and their opposition to the Jews did not cease with the establishment of the latter in Judea.

The Ammonites presented a serious problem to the Pharisees because many marriages between Israelite men and Ammonite (and Moabite) women had taken place in the days of Nehemiah. The men had married women of the various nations without conversion, which made the children not Jewish. They also joined the Syrians in their wars with the Maccabees and were defeated by Judas. The &quot;sons of Ammon&quot; would be subject to Israel during the time of the Messiah&#x27;s rulership according to the prophet Isaiah (Isaiah 11:14). The book of Zephaniah states that &quot;Moab will assuredly be like Sodom, and the sons of Ammon like Gomorrah‚ÄîGround overgrown with weeds and full of salt mines, and a permanent desolation.&quot; (Zephaniah 2:9).

===Modern interpretation===
The biblical narrative has traditionally been considered literal fact, but is now generally interpreted as recording a gross popular irony by which the Israelites expressed their loathing of the morality of the Moabites and Ammonites. It has been doubted, however, whether the Israelites would have directed such irony to Lot himself, particularly because incest was not explicitly forbidden or stigmatized until the Book of Leviticus, i.e. centuries after the time of Abraham and Lot.

===Rabbinic literature===
The Ammonites, still numerous in the south of Palestine in the second century CE according to Justin Martyr, presented a serious problem to the Pharisaic scribes because many marriages with Ammonite and Moabite wives had taken place in the days of Nehemiah (Neh. 13). Still later, it is not improbable that when Judas Maccabeus had inflicted a crushing defeat upon the Ammonites, Jewish warriors took Ammonite women as wives, and their sons, sword in hand, claimed recognition as Jews notwithstanding the law (Deut. 23) that &quot;an Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord.&quot; Such a condition or a similar incident is reflected in the story told in the Talmud that in the days of King Saul, the legitimacy of David&#x27;s claim to royalty was disputed on account of his descent from Ruth, the Moabite; whereupon Ithra, an Israelite, girt with his sword, strode like an Ishmaelite into the schoolhouse of Jesse, declaring upon the authority of Samuel, the prophet, and his bet din (court of justice), that the law excluding the Ammonite and Moabite from the Jewish congregation referred only to the men‚Äîwho alone had sinned in not meeting Israel with bread and water‚Äîand not to the women. The story reflects actual conditions in pre-Talmudic times, conditions that led to the fixed rule stated in the Mishnah: &quot;Ammonite and Moabite men are excluded from the Jewish community for all time; their women are admissible.&quot;

That Rehoboam, the son of King Solomon, was born of an Ammonite woman also made it difficult to maintain the messianic claims of the house of David; but it was adduced as an illustration of divine Providence which selected the &quot;two doves,&quot; Ruth, the Moabite, and Naamah, the Ammonitess, for honorable distinction. Ruth&#x27;s kindness as noted in the Book of Ruth by Boaz is seen in the Jewish Tradition as in rare contradistinction to the peoples of Moab (where Ruth comes from) and Amon in general, who were noted by the Torah for their distinct &quot;lack&quot; of kindness. Deut. 23:5: &quot;Because they [the peoples of Amon and Moab] did not greet you with bread and water on the way when you left Egypt, and because he [the people of Moab] hired Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor in Aram Naharaim against you, to curse you.&quot; Rashi notes regarding Israel&#x27;s travels on the way: &quot;when you were in [a state of] extreme exhaustion.&quot;

Jehoash was one of the four men who pretended to be gods. He was persuaded thereto particularly by the princes, who said to him. &quot;Wert thou not a god thou couldst not come out alive from the Holy of Holies&quot; . He was assassinated by two of his servants, one of whom was the son of an Ammonite woman and the other the offspring of a Moabite (2 Chron. 24:26); for God said: &quot;Let the descendants of the two ungrateful families chastise the ungrateful Joash&quot; (Yalk., Ex. 262). Moab and Ammon were the two offspring of Lot&#x27;s incest with his two daughters as described in Gen. 19:30‚Äì38.

Baalis, king of the Ammonites, envious of the Jewish colony&#x27;s prosperity, or jealous of the might of the Babylonian king, instigated Ishmael, son of Nathaniel, &quot;of the royal seed,&quot; to make an end of the Judean rule in Palestine, Ishmael, being an unscrupulous character, permitted himself to become the tool of the Ammonite king in order to realize his own ambition to become the ruler of the deserted land. Information of this conspiracy reached Gedaliah through Johanan, son of Kareah, and Johanan undertook to slay Ishmael before he had had time to carry out his evil design; but the governor disbelieved the report, and forbade Johanan to lay hands upon the conspirator. Ishmael and his ten companions were royally entertained at Gedaliah&#x27;s table. In the midst of the festivities Ishmael slew the unsuspecting Gedaliah, the Chaldean garrison stationed in Mizpah, and all the Jews that were with him, casting their bodies into the pit of Asa (Josephus, &quot;Ant.&quot; x. 9, ¬ß 4). The Rabbis condemn the overconfidence of Gedaliah, holding him responsible for the death of his followers (Niddah 61a; comp. Jer. xli. 9). Ishmael captured many of the inhabitants of Mizpah, as well as &quot;the daughters of the king&quot; entrusted to Gedaliah&#x27;s care by the Babylonian general, and fled to Ammon. Johanan and his followers, however, on receiving the sad tidings, immediately pursued the murderers, overtaking them at the lake of Gibeon. The captives were rescued, but Ishmael and eight of his men escaped to the land of Ammon. The plan of Baalis thus succeeded, for the Jewish refugees, fearing lest the Babylonian king should hold them responsible for the murder, never returned to their native land. In spite of the exhortations of Jeremiah they fled to Egypt, joined by the remnant of the Jews that had survived, together with Jeremiah and Baruch (Jer. xliii. 6). The rule of Gedaliah lasted, according to tradition, only two months, although Gr√§tz argues that it continued more than four years.

==Language==

The few Ammonite names that have been preserved also include Nahash and Hanun, both from the Bible. The Ammonites&#x27; language is believed to be in the Canaanite family, closely related to Hebrew and Moabite. Ammonite may have incorporated certain Aramaic influences, including the use of &quot;‚Äòbd&quot;, instead of commoner Biblical Hebrew &quot;‚Äò≈õh&quot;, for &quot;work&quot;. The only other notable difference with Biblical Hebrew is the sporadic retention of feminine singular &quot;-t&quot; (e.g., &quot;≈°ƒßt&quot; &quot;cistern&quot;, but &quot;lyh&quot; &quot;high (fem.)&quot;.)

===Inscriptions===
Inscriptions found in the Ammonite language include an inscription on a bronze bottle dating to c. 600 BC and the Amman Citadel Inscription.

==Religion==
Sources for what little is known of Ammonite religion are mostly the Hebrew Bible and material evidence. In general it appears to have been rather typical for Levantine religions, with Milcom, El and the moon god being the most prominent deities.

==Economy==
The economy, for the most part, was based on agriculture and herding. Most people lived in small villages surrounded by farms and pastures. Like its sister-kingdom of Moab, Ammon was the source of numerous natural resources, including sandstone and limestone. It had a productive agricultural sector and occupied a vital place along the King&#x27;s Highway, the ancient trade route connecting Egypt with Mesopotamia, Syria, and Asia Minor. As with the Edomites and Moabites, trade along this route gave them considerable revenue. Circa 950 BC Ammon showed rising prosperity, due to agriculture and trade, and built a series of fortresses. Its capital was located in what is now the Citadel of Amman.

<text>Ammonius Hermiae (; ; ‚Äì between 517 and 526) was a Greek philosopher from Alexandria in the eastern Roman empire during Late Antiquity. A Neoplatonist, he was the son of the philosophers Hermias and Aedesia, the brother of Heliodorus of Alexandria and the grandson of Syrianus. Ammonius was a pupil of Proclus in Roman Athens, and taught at Alexandria for most of his life, having obtained a public chair in the 470s.

According to Olympiodorus of Thebes&#x27;s &quot;Commentaries&quot; on Plato&#x27;s &quot;Gorgias&quot; and &quot;Phaedo&quot; texts, Ammonius gave lectures on the works of Plato, Aristotle, and Porphyry of Tyre, and wrote commentaries on Aristotelian works and three lost commentaries on Platonic texts. He is also the author of a text on the astrolabe published in the &quot;Catalogus Codicum Astrologorum Graecorum&quot;, and lectured on astronomy and geometry. Ammonius taught numerous Neoplatonists, including Damascius, Olympiodorus of Thebes, John Philoponus, Simplicius of Cilicia, and Asclepius of Tralles. Also among his pupils were the physician Gessius of Petra and the ecclesiastical historian Zacharias Rhetor, who became the bishop of Mytilene.

As part of the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire, the Alexandrian school was investigated by the Roman imperial authorities; Ammonius made a compromise with the Patriarch of Alexandria, Peter III, voluntarily limiting his teaching in return for keeping his own position. This alienated a number of his colleagues and pupils, including Damascius, who nonetheless called him &quot;the greatest commentator who ever lived&quot; in his own &quot;Life of Isidore of Alexandria&quot;.

==Life==
Ammonius&#x27; father Hermias died when he was a child, and his mother Aedesia raised him and his brother Heliodorus in Alexandria. When they reached adulthood, Aedesia accompanied her sons to Athens where they studied under Proclus. Eventually, they returned to Alexandria where Ammonius, as head of the Neoplatonist school in the city, lectured on Plato and Aristotle for the rest of his life. According to Damascius, during the persecution of the pagans at Alexandria in the late 480s, Ammonius made concessions to the Christian authorities so that he could continue his lectures. Damascius, who scolds Ammonius for the agreement that he made, does not say what the concessions were, but they may have involved limitations on the doctrines he could teach or promote. He was still teaching in 515; Olympiodorus heard him lecture on Plato&#x27;s &quot;Gorgias&quot; in that year. He was also an accomplished astronomer; he lectured on Ptolemy and is known to have written a treatise on the astrolabe.

==Writings==

Of his reputedly numerous writings, only his commentary on Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;De Interpretatione&quot; survives intact. A commentary on Porphyry&#x27;s &quot;Isagoge&quot; may also be his, but it is somewhat corrupt and contains later interpolations.

In &quot;De Interpretatione&quot;, Ammonius contends that divine foreknowledge makes void the contingent. Like Boethius in his second &quot;Commentary&quot; and in &quot;The Consolation of Philosophy,&quot; this argument maintains the effectiveness of prayer. Ammonius cites Iamblichus, who said &quot;knowledge is intermediate between the knower and the known, since it is the activity of the knower concerning the known.&quot;

In addition, there are some notes of Ammonius&#x27; lectures written by various students which also survive:

*On Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Categories&quot; (anonymous writer)
*On Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Prior Analytics I&quot; (anonymous writer)
*On Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Metaphysics 1‚Äì7&quot; (written by Asclepius)
*On Nicomachus&#x27; &quot;Introduction to Arithmetic&quot; (written by Asclepius)
*On Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Prior Analytics&quot; (written by John Philoponus)
*On Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Posterior Analytics&quot; (written by John Philoponus)
*On Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;On Generation and Corruption&quot; (written by John Philoponus)
*On Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;On the Soul&quot; (written by John Philoponus)

There is Greek-language work called &quot;Life of Aristotle&quot;, which is usually ascribed to Ammonius, but &quot;is more probable that it is the work of Joannes Philoponus, the pupil of Ammonius, to whom it is ascribed in some MSS.&quot;

<doc id="1724" wikidata="Q310173" url="?curid=1724" title="Ammonius Saccas">
<text>Ammonius Saccas (; ; 175 AD243 AD) was a Hellenistic Platonist self-taught philosopher from Alexandria, generally regarded as the precursor of Neoplatonism or one of its founders. He is mainly known as the teacher of Plotinus, whom he taught from 232 to 243. He was undoubtedly the most significant influence on Plotinus in his development of Neoplatonism, although little is known about his own philosophical views. Later Christian writers stated that Ammonius was a Christian, but it is now generally assumed that there was a different Ammonius of Alexandria who wrote biblical texts.

==Life==
The origins and meaning of Ammonius&#x27; cognomen, &quot;Sakkas&quot;, are disputed. Many scholars have interpreted it as indicating he was a porter in his youth, a view supported in antiquity by Byzantine bishop Theodoret. Others have asserted that this is a misreading of &quot;Sakkas&quot; for &quot;sakkophoros&quot; (porter). Some others have connected the cognomen with the &quot;≈öƒÅkyas&quot;, an ancient ruling clan of India, claiming that Ammonius Saccas was of Indian origin. This view has both been subsequently contested and supported by more recent scholarship. Some scholars supporting Ammonius&#x27; Indian origin have also contended that this ancestry is consistent with the passion of his foremost student Plotinus for India, and helps to explain the philosophical similarities between Vedanta and Neoplatonism, which many scholars attribute to Indian influence. On the other hand, scholars contesting his Indian origins point out that Ammonius was from the Brucheion quarter of Alexandria, which was the royal quarter of the city inhabited mostly by Greeks, and that the name &quot;Ammonius&quot; was common to many Greeks, with a number of scholars and historians supporting a Greek origin for Ammonius. However, his name is theophoric to the deity Amun, indicating possible Egyptian origin.

Most details of Ammonius&#x27; life come from the fragments left from Porphyry&#x27;s writings. The most famous pupil of Ammonius Saccas was Plotinus, who studied under Ammonius for eleven years. According to Porphyry, in 232, at the age of 28, Plotinus went to Alexandria to study philosophy:
In his twenty-eighth year he [Plotinus] felt the impulse to study philosophy and was recommended to the teachers in Alexandria who then had the highest reputation; but he came away from their lectures so depressed and full of sadness that he told his trouble to one of his friends. The friend, understanding the desire of his heart, sent him to Ammonius, whom he had not so far tried. He went and heard him, and said to his friend, &quot;This is the man I was looking for.&quot; From that day he stayed continually with Ammonius and acquired so complete a training in philosophy that he became eager to make acquaintance with the Persian philosophical discipline and that prevailing among the Indians.

According to Porphyry, the parents of Ammonius were Christians, but upon learning Greek philosophy, Ammonius rejected his parents&#x27; religion for paganism. This conversion is contested by the Christian writers Jerome and Eusebius, who state that Ammonius remained a Christian throughout his lifetime:

[Porphyry] plainly utters a falsehood (for what will not an opposer of Christians do?) when he says that ... Ammonius fell from a life of piety into heathen customs. ... Ammonius held the divine philosophy unshaken and unadulterated to the end of his life. His works yet extant show this, as he is celebrated among many for the writings which he has left.

However, we are told by Longinus that Ammonius wrote nothing, and if Ammonius was the principal influence on Plotinus, then it is unlikely that Ammonius would have been a Christian. One way to explain much of the confusion concerning Ammonius is to assume that there were two people called Ammonius: Ammonius Saccas who taught Plotinus, and an Ammonius the Christian who wrote biblical texts. Another explanation might be that there was only one Ammonius but that Origen, who found the Neo-Platonist views of his teacher essential to his own beliefs about the essential nature of Christianity, chose to suppress Ammonius&#x27; choice of Paganism over Christianity. The insistence of Eusebius, Origen&#x27;s pupil, and Jerome, all of whom were recognized Fathers of the Christian Church, that Ammonius Saccas had not rejected his Christian roots would be easier for Christians to accept than the assertion of Porphyry, who was a Pagan, that Ammonius had chosen Paganism over Christianity.

To add to the confusion, it seems that Ammonius had two pupils called Origen: Origen the Christian, and Origen the Pagan. It is quite possible that Ammonius Saccas taught both Origens. And since there were two Origens who were accepted as contemporaries it was easy for later Christians to accept that there were two individuals named Ammonius, one a Christian and one a Pagan. Among Ammonius&#x27; other pupils there were Herennius and Cassius Longinus.

==Philosophy==
Hierocles, writing in the 5th century, states that Ammonius&#x27; fundamental doctrine was that Plato and Aristotle were in full agreement with each other:
He was the first who had a godly zeal for the truth in philosophy and despised the views of the majority, which were a disgrace to philosophy. He apprehended well the views of each of the two philosophers [Plato and Aristotle] and brought them under one and the same &quot;nous&quot; and transmitted philosophy without conflicts to all of his disciples, and especially to the best of those acquainted with him, Plotinus, Origen, and their successors.

According to Nemesius, a bishop and Neoplatonist c. 400, Ammonius held that the soul was immaterial.

Little is known about Ammonius&#x27;s role in the development of Neoplatonism. Porphyry seems to suggest that Ammonius was instrumental in helping Plotinus think about philosophy in new ways:
But he [Plotinus] did not just speak straight out of these books but took a distinctive personal line in his consideration, and brought the mind of Ammonius&#x27; to bear on the investigation in hand.

Two of Ammonius&#x27;s students ‚Äì Origen the Pagan, and Longinus ‚Äì seem to have held philosophical positions which were closer to Middle Platonism than Neoplatonism, which perhaps suggests that Ammonius&#x27;s doctrines were also closer to those of Middle Platonism than the Neoplatonism developed by Plotinus (see the &quot;Enneads&quot;), but Plotinus does not seem to have thought that he was departing in any significant way from that of his master. 
Like Porphyry (&quot;The Life of Plotinus&quot;, 3, 24‚Äì29), also Nemesius refers of Ammonius Saccas as the teacher or the master of Plotinus (Nemesius, &quot;Nature of Man&quot;, 2.103).

<doc id="1726" wikidata="Q174677" url="?curid=1726" title="Book of Amos">
<text>The Book of Amosis the third of the Twelve Minor Prophets in the Old Testament (Tanakh) and the second in the Greek Septuagint tradition. According to the Bible, Amos was an older contemporary of Hosea and Isaiah, and was active c. 750 BC during the reign of Jeroboam II (788‚Äì747 BC) of Samaria (Northern Israel), while Uzziah was King of Judah. Amos is said to have lived in the kingdom of Judah but preached in the northern Kingdom of Israel where themes of social justice, God&#x27;s omnipotence, and divine judgment became staples of prophecy. In recent years, scholars have grown more skeptical of The Book of Amos‚Äô presentation of Amos‚Äô biography and background. It is known for its distinct ‚Äúsinister tone and violent portrayal of God.‚Äù

==Structure==
According to Michael D. Coogan, the Book of Amos can be structured as follows:
*Oracles against the nations (1:3‚Äì2:6)
*Oracle concerning prophecy (3:3‚Äì8)
*Addresses to groups in Israel
**Women of Samaria (4:1‚Äì3)
**Rich people in Samaria (6:1‚Äì7)
**Rich people in Jerusalem (8:4‚Äì8)
*Five visions of God&#x27;s judgment on Israel, interrupted by a confrontation between Amos and his listeners at Bethel (7:10‚Äì17):
**Locusts (7:1‚Äì3)
**Fire (7:4‚Äì6)
**A plumb line (7:7‚Äì9)
**A basket of fruit (8:1‚Äì3)
**God besides the altar (9:1‚Äì8a)
*Epilogue (9:8b‚Äì15)

==Summary==
The book opens with a historical note about the prophet, then a short oracle announcing Yahweh&#x27;s judgment (repeated in the Book of Joel). The prophet denounces the crimes committed by the gentile (non-Jewish) nations, and tells Israel that even they have sinned and are guilty of the same crimes, and reports five symbolic visions prophesying the destruction of Israel. Included in this, with no apparent order, are an oracle on the nature of prophecy, snippets of hymns, oracles of woe, a third-person prose narrative concerning the prophet, and an oracle promising restoration of the House of David, which had not yet fallen in the lifetime of Amos.

==Composition==
Amos prophesied during the reigns of Jeroboam II of Israel and Uzziah of Judah; this places him in the first half of the 8th century BC. According to the book&#x27;s superscription (Amos 1:1) he was from Tekoa, a town in Judah south of Jerusalem, but his prophetic mission was in the northern kingdom. He is called a &quot;shepherd&quot; and a &quot;dresser of sycamore trees&quot;, but the book&#x27;s literary qualities suggest a man of education rather than a poor farmer.

Scholars have long recognized that Amos utilized an ancient hymn within his prophecy, verses of which are found at 4:13, 5:8‚Äì9, 8:8, and 9:5‚Äì6. This hymn is best understood as praising Yahweh for his judgment, demonstrated in his destructive power, rather than praise for creation. Scholarship has also identified &#x27;Sumerian City Lament&#x27; (SCL) motifs within Amos and particularly the hymn, offering the possibility that Amos used SCL as a literary template for his prophecy of Jerusalem&#x27;s destruction. The Amos hymn has also been discussed in terms of a &quot;covenant curse&quot; which was used to warn Israel of the consequences of breaking the covenant, and in particular a &quot;Flood covenant-curse&quot; motif, first identified by D.R. Hillers. Recent scholarship has shown Amos&#x27;s hymn is an ancient narrative text, has identified a new verse at 7.4; and has compared the hymn to the Genesis Flood account and Job 9:5‚Äì10.

== Themes ==
The central idea of the book of Amos is that God puts his people on the same level as the surrounding nations ‚Äì God expects the same purity of them all. As it is with all nations that rise up against the kingdom of God, even Israel and Judah will not be exempt from the judgment of God because of their idolatry and unjust ways. The nation that represents Yahweh must be made pure of anything or anyone that profanes the name of God; his name must be exalted.

Amos is the first prophet to use the term &quot;the Day of the Lord&quot;. This phrase becomes important within future prophetic and apocalyptic literature. For the people of Israel &quot;The Day of the Lord&quot; is the day when God will fight against his and their enemies, and it will be a day of victory for Israel. However, Amos and other prophets include Israel as an enemy of God, as Israel is guilty of injustice toward the innocent, poor, and young women. To Amos &quot;The Day of the Lord&quot; will be a day of doom.

Other major ideas proposed in the book of Amos include justice and concern for the disadvantaged, and that Yahweh is God of all nations (not just Israel), and is likewise the judge of all nations, and is also a God of moral righteousness. Also that Yahweh created all people, and the idea that Israel&#x27;s covenant with God did not exempt them from accountability for sin; as well as that God elected and liberated Israel so that he would be known throughout the world. And that if God destroys the unjust, a remnant will remain, and that God is free to judge whether to redeem Israel.

<doc id="1727" wikidata="Q217414" url="?curid=1727" title="Amphipolis">
<text>Amphipolis (; ) was an important ancient Greek polis (city), and later a Roman city, whose large remains can still be seen. It gave its name to the modern municipality of Amphipoli, in the Serres regional unit of northern Greece.

Amphipolis was originally a colony of ancient Athenians and was the site of the battle between the Spartans and Athenians in 422 BC. It was later the place where Alexander the Great prepared for campaigns leading to his invasion of Asia in 335 BC. Alexander&#x27;s three finest admirals, Nearchus, Androsthenes and Laomedon, resided in Amphipolis. After Alexander&#x27;s death, his wife Roxana and their son Alexander IV were imprisoned and murdered there in 311 BC.

Excavations in and around the city have revealed important buildings, ancient walls and tombs. The finds are displayed at the archaeological museum of Amphipolis. At the nearby vast Kasta burial mound, an ancient Macedonian tomb has recently been revealed. The Lion of Amphipolis monument nearby is a popular destination for visitors.

It was located within the region of Edonis.

==History==
===Origins===
Throughout the 5th century BC, Athens sought to consolidate its control over Thrace, which was strategically important because of its raw materials (the gold and silver of the Pangaion hills and the dense forests that provided timber for naval construction), and the sea routes vital for Athens&#x27; supply of grain from Scythia. 
A first unsuccessful attempt at colonisation was in 497¬†BC by the Milesian Tyrant Histiaeus. After the defeat of the Persians at the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC, the Athenian general Kimon managed to occupy Eion a few kilometres south on the coast in 476 BC, and turned it into a military base and commercial port. The Athenians founded a first colony at &quot;Ennea-Hodoi&quot; (‚ÄòNine Ways‚Äô) in 465¬†BC, but the first ten thousand colonists were massacred by the Thracians. A second attempt took place in 437¬†BC on the same site under general Hagnon which was successful. The city and its first impressive and elaborately built walls of 7.5¬†km length date from this time. The new Athenian colony quickly became of considerable size and wealth.

The new settlement took the name of Amphipolis (literally, &quot;around the city&quot;), a name which is the subject of much debate about its etymology. Thucydides claims the name comes from the fact that the Strymon River flows &quot;around the city&quot; on two sides; however a note in the &quot;Suda&quot; (also given in the lexicon of Photius) offers a different explanation apparently given by Marsyas, son of Periander: that a large proportion of the population lived &quot;around the city&quot;. However, a more probable explanation is the one given by Julius Pollux: that the name indicates the vicinity of an isthmus.

Amphipolis quickly became the main power base of the Athenians in Thrace and, consequently, a target of choice for their Spartan adversaries. In 424 BC during the Peloponnesian War the Spartan general Brasidas captured Amphipolis.

Two years later in 422¬†BC, a new Athenian force under the general Cleon failed once more during the Battle of Amphipolis at which both Kleon and Brasidas lost their lives. Brasidas survived long enough to hear of the defeat of the Athenians and was buried at Amphipolis with impressive pomp. From then on he was regarded as the founder of the city and honoured with yearly games and sacrifices.

The Athenian population remained very much in the minority in the city and hence Amphipolis remained an independent city and an ally of the Athenians, rather than a colony or member of the Athens-led Delian League. It entered a new phase of prosperity as a cosmopolitan centre.

===Macedonian rule===
The city itself kept its independence until the reign of king Philip II () despite several Athenian attacks, notably because of the government of Callistratus of Aphidnae. In 357¬†BC, Philip succeeded where the Athenians had failed and conquered the city, thereby removing the obstacle which Amphipolis presented to Macedonian control over Thrace. According to the historian Theopompus, this conquest came to be the object of a secret accord between Athens and Philip II, who would return the city in exchange for the fortified town of Pydna, but the Macedonian king betrayed the accord, refusing to cede Amphipolis and laying siege to Pydna as well.

The city was not immediately incorporated into the Macedonian kingdom, and for some time preserved its institutions and a certain degree of autonomy. The border of Macedonia was not moved further east; however, Philip sent a number of Macedonian governors to Amphipolis, and in many respects the city was effectively &quot;Macedonianized&quot;. Nomenclature, the calendar and the currency (the gold stater, created by Philip to capitalise on the gold reserves of the Pangaion hills, replaced the Amphipolitan drachma) were all replaced by Macedonian equivalents. In the reign of Alexander the Great, Amphipolis was an important naval base, and the birthplace of three of the most famous Macedonian admirals: Nearchus, Androsthenes and Laomedon, whose burial place is most likely marked by the famous lion of Amphipolis.

The importance of the city in this period is shown by Alexander the Great&#x27;s decision that it was one of the six cities at which large luxurious temples costing 1,500 talents were built. Alexander prepared for campaigns here against Thrace in 335¬†BC and his army and fleet assembled near the port before the invasion of Asia. The port was also used as naval base during his campaigns in Asia. After Alexander&#x27;s death, his wife Roxana and their young son Alexander¬†IV were exiled by Cassander and later murdered here.

Throughout Macedonian sovereignty Amphipolis was a strong fortress of great strategic and economic importance, as shown by inscriptions. Amphipolis became one of the main stops on the Macedonian royal road (as testified by a border stone found between Philippi and Amphipolis giving the distance to the latter), and later on the &quot;Via Egnatia&quot;, the principal Roman road which crossed the southern Balkans. Apart from the ramparts of the lower town, the gymnasium and a set of well-preserved frescoes from a wealthy villa are the only artifacts from this period that remain visible. Though little is known of the layout of the town, modern knowledge of its institutions is in considerably better shape thanks to a rich epigraphic documentation, including a military ordinance of Philip V and an ephebarchic law from the gymnasium.

===Conquest by the Romans===

After the final victory of Rome over Macedonia in the Battle of Pydna in 168¬†BC, Amphipolis became the capital of one of the four mini-republics, or &quot;merides&quot;, which were created by the Romans out of the kingdom of the Antigonids which succeeded Alexander&#x27;s empire in Macedon. These &quot;merides&quot; were gradually incorporated into the Roman client state, and later province, of Thracia. According to the &quot;Acts of the Apostles&quot;, the apostles Paul and Silas passed through Amphipolis in the early AD¬†50s, on their journey between Philippi and Thessalonica; where hence they proselytized to the Greeks, including Epicurean and Stoic philosophers.

In the 1st c. BC the city was badly damaged in the Thracian revolt against Roman rule.

===Revival in Late Antiquity===
During the period of Late Antiquity, Amphipolis benefited from the increasing economic prosperity of Macedonia, as is evidenced by the large number of Christian churches that were built. Significantly however, these churches were built within a restricted area of the town, sheltered by the walls of the acropolis. This has been taken as evidence that the large fortified perimeter of the ancient town was no longer defendable, and that the population of the city had considerably diminished.

Nevertheless, the number, size and quality of the churches constructed between the 5th and 6th centuries are impressive. Four basilicas adorned with rich mosaic floors and elaborate architectural sculptures (such as the ram-headed column capitals ‚Äì see picture) have been excavated, as well as a church with a hexagonal central plan which evokes that of the basilica of St Vitalis in Ravenna. It is difficult to find reasons for such municipal extravagance in such a small town. One possible explanation provided by the historian Andr√© Boulanger is that an increasing ‚Äòwillingness‚Äô on the part of the wealthy upper classes in the late Roman period to spend money on local gentrification projects (which he terms &quot;euergetism&quot;, from the Greek verb ; meaning &#x27;I do good&#x27;) was exploited by the local church to its advantage, which led to a mass gentrification of the urban centre and of the agricultural riches of the city&#x27;s territory. Amphipolis was also a diocese under the metropolitan see of Thessalonica ‚Äì the Bishop of Amphipolis is first mentioned in 533. The bishopric is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.

===Final decline of the city===

The Slavic invasions of the late 6th century gradually encroached on the back-country Amphipolitan lifestyle and led to the decline of the town, during which period its inhabitants retreated to the area around the acropolis. The ramparts were maintained to a certain extent, thanks to materials plundered from the monuments of the lower city, and the large unused cisterns of the upper city were occupied by small houses and the workshops of artisans. Around the middle of the 7th century, a further reduction of the inhabited area of the city was followed by an increase in the fortification of the town, with the construction of a new rampart with pentagonal towers cutting through the middle of the remaining monuments. The acropolis, the Roman baths, and especially the episcopal basilica were crossed by this wall.

The city was probably abandoned in the eighth century, as the last bishop was attested at the Second Council of Nicaea in 787. Its inhabitants probably moved to the neighbouring site of ancient Eion, port of Amphipolis, which had been rebuilt and refortified in the Byzantine period under the name ‚ÄúChrysopolis‚Äù. This small port continued to enjoy some prosperity, before being abandoned during the Ottoman period. The last recorded sign of activity in the region of Amphipolis was the construction of a fortified tower to the north in 1367 by the &quot;megas primikerios&quot; John and the &quot;stratopedarches&quot; Alexios to protect the land that they had given to the monastery of Pantokrator on Mount Athos.

==Archaeology==

The site was discovered and described by many travellers and archaeologists during the 19th century, including E. Cousin√©ry (1831) (engraver), Leon Heuzey (1861), and P. Perdrizet (1894‚Äì1899). However, excavations did not truly begin until after the Second World War. The Greek Archaeological Society under D. Lazaridis excavated in 1972 and 1985, uncovering a necropolis, the city wall (see photograph), the basilicas, and the acropolis. Further excavations have since uncovered the river bridge, the gymnasium, Greek and Roman villas and numerous tombs etc.

Parts of the lion monument and tombs were discovered during World War I by Bulgarian and British troops whilst digging trenches in the area. In 1934, M. Feyel, of the √âcole fran√ßaise d&#x27;Ath√®nes (EfA), led an epigraphical mission to the site and uncovered further remains of the lion monument (a reconstruction was given in the &quot;Bulletin de Correspondance Hell√©nique&quot;, a publication of the EfA which is available on line).

The silver ossuary containing the cremated remains of Brasidas and a gold crown (see image) was found in a tomb in pride of place under the Agora.

===The Tomb of Amphipolis===


In 2012 Greek archaeologists unearthed a large tomb within the Kasta Hill, the biggest burial mound in Greece, northeast of Amphipolis. The large size and quality of the tumulus indicates the prominence of the burials made there, and its dating and the connections of the city with Alexander the Great suggest important occupants. The perimeter wall of the tumulus is long, and is made of limestone covered with marble.

The tomb comprises three chambers separated by walls. There are two sphinxes just outside the entrance to the tomb. Two of the columns supporting the roof in the first section are in the form of Caryatids, in the 4th century BC style. The excavation revealed a pebble mosaic directly behind the Caryatids and in front of the Macedonian marble door leading to the &quot;third&quot; chamber. The mosaic shows the allegory of the abduction of Persephone by Hades, but the persons depicted are Philip and Olympias of Macedon. Hades&#x27; chariot is drawn by two white horses and led to the underworld by Hermes. The mosaic verifies the Macedonian character of the tomb. As the head of one of the sphinxes was found inside the tomb behind the broken door, it is clear that there were intruders, probably in antiquity.

Fragments of bones from 5 individuals were found in the cist tomb, the most complete of which is a 60+ year old woman in the deepest layer. Dr. Katerina Peristeri, the archaeologist heading the excavation of the tomb, dates the tomb to the late 4th century BC, the period after the death of Alexander the Great (323¬†BC). One theory is that the tomb was built for the mother of Alexander the Great, Olympias.

Restoration of the tomb is due for completion in 2023 in the course of which building materials of the grave site which were later used by the Romans elsewhere will be rebuilt in their original location.
===The city walls===

The original 7.5¬†km long walls are generally visible, particularly the northern section which is preserved to a height of 7.5m. 5 preserved gates can be seen and notably the gate in front of the wooden bridge.

In early Christian times another, inner, wall was built around the acropolis.

===The ancient wooden bridge of Amphipolis===

The ancient bridge that crossed the river Strymon was mentioned by Thucydides, was strategic as it controlled access between Macedonia and the Chalkidike in the west to Thrace in the east, and was important for the economy and trade. It was therefore incorporated into the city walls.
It was discovered in 1977 and is a unique find for Greek antiquity. The hundreds of wooden piles have been carbon-dated and show the vast life of the bridge with some piles dating from 760 BC, and others used till about 1800 AD.

===The Gymnasium===
This was a major public building for the military and gymnastic training of youth as well as for their artistic and intellectual education. It was built in the 4th c. BC and includes a palaestra, the rectangular court surrounded by colonnades with adjoining rooms for many athletic functions. The covered stoa or xystos for indoor training in inclement weather is a long portico 75m long and 7m wide to allow 6 runners to compete simultaneously. There was also a parallel outdoor track, &quot;paradromida&quot;, for training in good weather and a system of cisterns for water supply.

During the Macedonian era it became a major institution.

The stone stela bearing the rules of the gymnasium was found in the north wing, detailing the duties and powers of the master and the education of the athletes.

After it was destroyed in the 1st c. BC in the Thracian rebellion against Roman rule, it was rebuilt in Augustus&#x27;s time in the 1st c. AD along with the rest of the city.
