<text>The bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) is a bird of prey found in North America. A sea eagle, it has two known subspecies and forms a species pair with the white-tailed eagle (&quot;Haliaeetus albicilla&quot;), which occupies the same niche as the bald eagle in the Palearctic. Its range includes most of Canada and Alaska, all of the contiguous United States, and northern Mexico. It is found near large bodies of open water with an abundant food supply and old-growth trees for nesting.

The bald eagle is an opportunistic feeder which subsists mainly on fish, which it swoops down upon and snatches from the water with its talons. It builds the largest nest of any North American bird and the largest tree nests ever recorded for any animal species, up to deep, wide, and in weight. Sexual maturity is attained at the age of four to five years.

Bald eagles are not bald; the name derives from an older meaning of the word, &quot;white-headed&quot;. The adult is mainly brown with a white head and tail. The sexes are identical in plumage, but females are about 25 percent larger than males. The yellow beak is large and hooked. The plumage of the immature is brown.

The bald eagle is the national symbol of the United States and appears on its seal. In the late 20th century it was on the brink of extirpation in the contiguous United States, but measures such as banning the practice of hunting bald eagles and banning the use of the harmful pesticide DDT slowed the decline of their population. Populations have since recovered, and the species&#x27; status was upgraded from &quot;endangered&quot; to &quot;threatened&quot; in 1995 and removed from the list altogether in 2007. In 2024, the bald eagle was officially made the national bird of the United States.

==Taxonomy==

The bald eagle is placed in the genus &quot;Haliaeetus&quot; (sea eagles), and gets both its common and specific scientific names from the distinctive appearance of the adult&#x27;s head. &quot;Bald&quot; in the English name is from an older usage meaning &quot;having white on the face or head&quot; rather than &quot;hairless&quot;, referring to the white head feathers contrasting with the darker body. 

The genus name is Neo-Latin: &quot;Haliaeetus&quot; (from the ), and the specific name, &quot;leucocephalus&quot;, is Latinized () and ().

The bald eagle was one of the many species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his 18th-century work &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, under the name &quot;Falco leucocephalus&quot;.

The bald eagle forms a species pair with the white-tailed eagle of Eurasia. This species pair consists of a white-headed and a tan-headed species of roughly equal size; the white-tailed eagle also has overall somewhat paler brown body plumage. The two species fill the same ecological niche in their respective ranges. The pair diverged from other sea eagles at the beginning of the Early Miocene (c. 10Â Ma BP) at the latest, but possibly as early as the Early/Middle Oligocene, 28 Ma BP, if the most ancient fossil record is correctly assigned to this genus.

=== Subspecies ===
There are two recognized subspecies of bald eagle:
* &quot;H. l. leucocephalus&quot; is the nominate subspecies. It is found in the southern United States and Baja California Peninsula.
* &quot;H. l. washingtoniensis&quot; , synonym &quot;H. l. alascanus&quot; , the northern subspecies, is larger than southern nominate &quot;leucocephalus&quot;. It is found in the northern United States, Canada and Alaska.

==Description==

The plumage of an adult bald eagle is evenly dark brown with a white head and tail. The tail is moderately long and slightly wedge-shaped. Males and females are identical in plumage coloration, but sexual dimorphism is evident in the species, in that females are 25% larger than males. The beak, feet and irises are bright yellow. The legs are feather-free, and the toes are short and powerful with large talons. The highly developed talon of the hind toe is used to pierce the vital areas of prey while it is held immobile by the front toes. The beak is large and hooked, with a yellow cere. The adult bald eagle is unmistakable in its native range. The closely related African fish eagle (&quot;Haliaeetus vocifer&quot;) (from far outside the bald eagle&#x27;s range) also has a brown body (albeit of somewhat more rufous hue), white head and tail, but differs from the bald eagle in having a white chest and black tip to the bill.
The plumage of the immature is a dark brown overlaid with messy white streaking until the fifth (rarely fourth, very rarely third) year, when it reaches sexual maturity. Immature bald eagles are distinguishable from the golden eagle (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;), the only other very large, non-vulturine raptorial bird in North America, in that the former has a larger, more protruding head with a larger beak, straighter edged wings which are held flat (not slightly raised) and with a stiffer wing beat and feathers which do not completely cover the legs. When seen well, the golden eagle is distinctive in plumage with a more solid warm brown color than an immature bald eagle, with a reddish-golden patch to its nape and (in immature birds) a highly contrasting set of white squares on the wing.

The bald eagle has sometimes been considered the largest true raptor (accipitrid) in North America. The only larger species of raptor-like bird is the California condor (&quot;Gymnogyps californianus&quot;), a New World vulture which today is not generally considered a taxonomic ally of true accipitrids. However, the golden eagle, averaging and in wing chord length in its American race (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos canadensis&quot;), is merely lighter in mean body mass and exceeds the bald eagle in mean wing chord length by around . Additionally, the bald eagle&#x27;s close cousins, the relatively longer-winged but shorter-tailed white-tailed eagle and the overall larger Steller&#x27;s sea eagle (&quot;Haliaeetus pelagicus&quot;), may, rarely, wander to coastal Alaska from Asia.

The bald eagle has a body length of . Typical wingspan is between and mass is normally between . Females are about 25% larger than males, averaging as much as , and against the males&#x27; average weight of .

The size of the bird varies by location and generally corresponds with Bergmann&#x27;s rule: the species increases in size further away from the equator and the tropics. For example, eagles from South Carolina average in mass and in wingspan, smaller than their northern counterparts. One field guide in Florida listed similarly small sizes for bald eagles there, at about . Of intermediate size, 117 migrant bald eagles in Glacier National Park were found to average but this was mostly (possibly post-dispersal) juvenile eagles, with 6 adults here averaging . Wintering eagles in Arizona (winter weights are usually the highest of the year since, like many raptors, they spend the highest percentage of time foraging during winter) were found to average .

The largest eagles are from Alaska, where large females may weigh more than and span across the wings. A survey of adult weights in Alaska showed that females there weighed on average , respectively, and males weighed against immatures which averaged and in the two sexes. An Alaskan adult female eagle that was considered outsized weighed some . R.S. Palmer listed a record from 1876 in Wyoming County, New York of an enormous adult bald eagle that was shot and reportedly scaled . Among standard linear measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is long, and the tarsus is . The culmen reportedly ranges from , while the measurement from the gape to the tip of the bill is . The bill size is unusually variable: Alaskan eagles can have up to twice the bill length of birds from the southern United States (Georgia, Louisiana, Florida), with means including both sexes of and in culmen length, respectively, from these two areas.

The call consists of weak staccato, chirping whistles, &quot;kleek kik ik ik ik&quot;, somewhat similar in cadence to a gull&#x27;s call. The calls of young birds tend to be more harsh and shrill than those of adults.

==Range==

The bald eagle&#x27;s natural range covers most of North America, including most of Canada, all of the continental United States, and northern Mexico. It is the only sea eagle endemic to North America. Occupying varied habitats from the bayous of Louisiana to the Sonoran Desert and the eastern deciduous forests of Quebec and New England, northern birds are migratory, while southern birds are resident, remaining on their breeding territory all year. At minimum population, in the 1950s, it was largely restricted to Alaska, the Aleutian Islands, northern and eastern Canada, and Florida. From 1966 to 2015 bald eagle numbers increased substantially throughout its winter and breeding ranges, and as of 2018 the species nests in every continental state and province in the United States and Canada.

The majority of bald eagles in Canada are found along the British Columbia coast while large populations are found in the forests of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario. Bald eagles also congregate in certain locations in winter. From November until February, one to two thousand birds winter in Squamish, British Columbia, about halfway between Vancouver and Whistler. In March 2024, bald eagles were found nesting in Toronto for the first time. The birds primarily gather along the Squamish and Cheakamus Rivers, attracted by the salmon spawning in the area. Similar congregations of wintering bald eagles at open lakes and rivers, wherein fish are readily available for hunting or scavenging, are observed in the northern United States.

It has occurred as a vagrant twice in Ireland; a juvenile was shot illegally in Fermanagh on January 11, 1973 (misidentified at first as a white-tailed eagle), and an exhausted juvenile was captured near Castleisland, County Kerry on November 15, 1987. There is also a record of it from Llyn Coron, Anglesey, in the United Kingdom, from October 17, 1978; the provenance of this individual eagle has remained in dispute.

==Habitat==
The bald eagle occurs during its breeding season in virtually any kind of American wetland habitat such as seacoasts, rivers, large lakes or marshes or other large bodies of open water with an abundance of fish. Studies have shown a preference for bodies of water with a circumference greater than , and lakes with an area greater than are optimal for breeding bald eagles.

The bald eagle typically requires old-growth and mature stands of coniferous or hardwood trees for perching, roosting, and nesting. Tree species reportedly is less important to the eagle pair than the tree&#x27;s height, composition and location. Perhaps of paramount importance for this species is an abundance of comparatively large trees surrounding the body of water. Selected trees must have good visibility, be over tall, an open structure, and proximity to prey. If nesting trees are in standing water such as in a mangrove swamp, the nest can be located fairly low, at as low as above the ground. In a more typical tree standing on dry ground, nests may be located from in height. In Chesapeake Bay, nesting trees averaged in diameter and in total height, while in Florida, the average nesting tree stands high and is in diameter. Trees used for nesting in the Greater Yellowstone area average high. Trees or forest used for nesting should have a canopy cover of no more than 60%, and no less than 20%, and be in close proximity to water. Most nests have been found within of open water. The greatest distance from open water recorded for a bald eagle nest was over , in Florida.

Bald eagle nests are often very large in order to compensate for size of the birds. The largest recorded nest was found in Florida in 1963, and was measured at wide and deep.

In Florida, nesting habitats often consist of mangrove swamps, the shorelines of lakes and rivers, pinelands, seasonally flooded flatwoods, hardwood swamps, and open prairies and pastureland with scattered tall trees. Favored nesting trees in Florida are slash pines (&quot;Pinus elliottii&quot;), longleaf pines (&quot;P. palustris&quot;), loblolly pines (&quot;P. taeda&quot;) and cypress trees, but for the southern coastal areas where mangroves are usually used. In Wyoming, groves of mature cottonwoods or tall pines found along streams and rivers are typical bald eagle nesting habitats. Wyoming eagles may inhabit habitat types ranging from large, old-growth stands of ponderosa pines (&quot;Pinus ponderosa&quot;) to narrow strips of riparian trees surrounded by rangeland. In Southeast Alaska, Sitka spruce (&quot;Picea sitchensis&quot;) provided 78% of the nesting trees used by eagles, followed by hemlocks (&quot;Tsuga&quot;) at 20%. Increasingly, eagles nest in human-made reservoirs stocked with fish.
The bald eagle is usually quite sensitive to human activity while nesting, and is found most commonly in areas with minimal human disturbance. It chooses sites more than from low-density human disturbance and more than from medium- to high-density human disturbance. However, bald eagles will occasionally nest in large estuaries or secluded groves within major cities, such as Hardtack Island on the Willamette River in Portland, Oregon or John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge at Tinicum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which are surrounded by a great quantity of human activity. Even more contrary to the usual sensitivity to disturbance, a family of bald eagles moved to the Harlem neighborhood in New York City in 2010.

While wintering, bald eagles tend to be less habitat and disturbance sensitive. They will commonly congregate at spots with plentiful perches and waters with plentiful prey and (in northern climes) partially unfrozen waters. Alternately, non-breeding or wintering bald eagles, particularly in areas with a lack of human disturbance, spend their time in various upland, terrestrial habitats sometimes quite far away from waterways. In the northern half of North America (especially the interior portion), this terrestrial inhabitance by bald eagles tends to be especially prevalent because unfrozen water may not be accessible. Upland wintering habitats often consist of open habitats with concentrations of medium-sized mammals, such as prairies, meadows or tundra, or open forests with regular carrion access.

==Behavior==
The bald eagle is a powerful flier, and soars on thermal convection currents. It reaches speeds of when gliding and flapping, and about while carrying fish. Its dive speed is between , though it seldom dives vertically. Regarding their flying abilities, despite being morphologically less well adapted to faster flight than golden eagles (especially during dives), the bald eagle is considered surprisingly maneuverable in flight. Bald eagles have also been recorded catching up to and then swooping under geese in flight, turning over and thrusting their talons into the other bird&#x27;s breast. It is partially migratory, depending on location. If its territory has access to open water, it remains there year-round, but if the body of water freezes during the winter, making it impossible to obtain food, it migrates to the south or to the coast. A number of populations are subject to post-breeding dispersal, mainly in juveniles; Florida eagles, for example, will disperse northwards in the summer. The bald eagle selects migration routes which take advantage of thermals, updrafts, and food resources. During migration, it may ascend in a thermal and then glide down, or may ascend in updrafts created by the wind against a cliff or other terrain. Migration generally takes place during the daytime, usually between the local hours of 8:00Â a.m. and 6:00Â p.m., when thermals are produced by the sun.

==Diet and feeding==
The bald eagle is an opportunistic carnivore with the capacity to consume a great variety of prey. Fish often comprise most of the eagle&#x27;s diet throughout their range. In 20 food habit studies across the species&#x27; range, fish comprised 56% of the diet of nesting eagles, birds 28%, mammals 14% and other prey 2%. More than 400 species are known to be included in the bald eagle&#x27;s prey spectrum, far more than its ecological equivalent in the Old World, the white-tailed eagle, is known to take. Despite its considerably lower population, the bald eagle may come in second amongst all North American accipitrids, slightly behind only the red-tailed hawk, in number of prey species recorded.

===Behavior===

To hunt fish, the eagle swoops down over the water and snatches the fish out of the water with its talons. They eat by holding the fish in one claw and tearing the flesh with the other. Eagles have structures on their toes called spicules that allow them to grasp fish. Ospreys also have this adaptation. Bird prey may occasionally be attacked in flight, with prey up to the size of Canada geese attacked and killed in mid-air. It has been estimated that the bald eagle&#x27;s gripping power (pounds by square inch) is ten times greater than that of a human. Bald eagles can fly with fish at least equal to their own weight, but if the fish is too heavy to lift, the eagle may be dragged into the water. Bald eagles can swim, but in some cases, they drag their catch ashore with their talons. Still, some eagles drown or succumb to hypothermia. Many sources claim that bald eagles, like all large eagles, cannot normally take flight carrying prey more than half of their own weight unless aided by favorable wind conditions. On numerous occasions, when large prey such as large fish including mature salmon or geese are attacked, eagles have been seen to make contact and then drag the prey in a strenuously labored, low flight over the water to a bank, where they then finish off and dismember the prey. When food is abundant, an eagle can gorge itself by storing up to of food in a pouch in the throat called a crop. Gorging allows the bird to fast for several days if food becomes unavailable. Occasionally, bald eagles may hunt cooperatively when confronting prey, especially relatively large prey such as jackrabbits or herons, with one bird distracting potential prey, while the other comes behind it in order to ambush it. While hunting waterfowl, bald eagles repeatedly fly at a target and cause it to dive repeatedly, hoping to exhaust the victim so it can be caught (white-tailed eagles have been recorded hunting waterfowl in the same way). When hunting concentrated prey, a successful catch often results in the hunting eagle being pursued by other eagles and needing to find an isolated perch for consumption if it is able to carry it away successfully.

They obtain much of their food as carrion or via a practice known as kleptoparasitism, by which they steal prey away from other predators. Due to their dietary habits, bald eagles are frequently viewed in a negative light by humans. Thanks to their superior foraging ability and experience, adults are generally more likely to hunt live prey than immature eagles, which often obtain their food from scavenging. They are not very selective about the condition or origin, whether provided by humans, other animals, auto accidents or natural causes, of a carcass&#x27;s presence, but will avoid eating carrion where disturbances from humans are a regular occurrence. They will scavenge carcasses up to the size of whales, though carcasses of ungulates and large fish are seemingly preferred. Congregated wintering waterfowl are frequently exploited for carcasses to scavenge by immature eagles in harsh winter weather. Bald eagles also may sometimes feed on material scavenged or stolen from campsites and picnics, as well as garbage dumps (dump usage is habitual mainly in Alaska) and fish-processing plants.

===Fish===
In Southeast Alaska, fish comprise approximately 66% of the year-round diet of bald eagles and 78% of the prey brought to the nest by the parents. Eagles living in the Columbia River Estuary in Oregon were found to rely on fish for 90% of their dietary intake. At least 100 species of fish have been recorded in the bald eagle&#x27;s diet. From observation in the Columbia River, 58% of the fish were caught alive by the eagle, 24% were scavenged as carcasses and 18% were pirated away from other animals.

In the Pacific Northwest, spawning trout and salmon provide most of the bald eagles&#x27; diet from late summer throughout fall. Though bald eagles occasionally catch live salmon, they usually scavenge spawned salmon carcass. Southeast Alaskan eagles largely prey on pink salmon (&quot;Oncorhynchus gorbuscha&quot;), coho salmon (&quot;O. kisutch&quot;) and, more locally, sockeye salmon (&quot;O. nerka&quot;), with Chinook salmon (&quot;O. tshawytscha&quot;). Due to the Chinook salmon&#x27;s large size ( average adult size) probably being taken only as carrion and a single carcass can attract several eagles. Also important in the estuaries and shallow coastlines of southern Alaska are Pacific herring (&quot;Clupea pallasii&quot;), Pacific sand lance (&quot;Ammodytes hexapterus&quot;) and eulachon (&quot;Thaleichthys pacificus&quot;). In Oregon&#x27;s Columbia River Estuary, the most significant prey species were largescale suckers (&quot;Catostomus macrocheilus&quot;) (17.3% of the prey selected there), American shad (&quot;Alosa sapidissima&quot;; 13%) and common carp (&quot;Cyprinus carpio&quot;; 10.8%). Eagles living in the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland were found to subsist largely on American gizzard shad (&quot;Dorosoma cepedianum&quot;), threadfin shad (&quot;Dorosoma petenense&quot;) and white bass (&quot;Morone chrysops&quot;). Floridian eagles have been reported to prey on catfish, most prevalently the brown bullhead (&quot;Ameiurus nebulosus&quot;) and any species in the genus &quot;Ictalurus&quot; as well as mullet, trout, needlefish, and eels. Chain pickerels (&quot;Esox niger&quot;) and white suckers (&quot;Catostomus commersonii&quot;) are frequently taken in interior Maine. Wintering eagles on the Platte River in Nebraska preyed mainly on American gizzard shads and common carp. Bald eagles are also known to eat the following fish species: rainbow trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss&quot;), white catfish (&quot;Ameiurus catus&quot;), rock greenling (&quot;Hexagrammos lagocephalus&quot;), Pacific cod (&quot;Gadus macrocephalus&quot;), Atka mackerel (&quot;Pleurogrammus monopterygius&quot;), largemouth bass (&quot;Micropterus salmoides&quot;), northern pike (&quot;Esox lucius&quot;), striped bass (&quot;Morone saxatilis&quot;), dogfish shark (&quot;Squalidae.sp&quot;) and Blue walleye (&quot;Sander vitreus&quot;).

Fish taken by bald eagles varies in size, but bald eagles take larger fish than other piscivorous birds in North America, typically range from and prefer fish. When experimenters offered fish of different sizes in the breeding season around Lake Britton in California, fish measuring were taken 71.8% of the time by parent eagles while fish measuring were chosen only 25% of the time. At nests around Lake Superior, the remains of fish (mostly suckers) were found to average in total length. In the Columbia River estuary, most preyed on by eagles were estimated to measure less than , but larger fish between or even exceeding in length also taken especially during the non-breeding seasons. They can take fish up to at least twice their own weight, such as large mature salmons, carps, or even muskellunge (&quot;Esox masquinongy&quot;), by dragging its catch with talons and pull toward ashore. Much larger marine fish such as Pacific halibut (&quot;Hippoglossus stenolepis&quot;) and lemon sharks (&quot;Negaprion brevirostris&quot;) have been recorded among bald eagle prey though probably are only taken as young, as small, newly mature fish, or as carrion.

Benthic fishes such as catfish are usually consumed after they die and float to the surface, though while temporarily swimming in the open may be more vulnerable to predation than most fish since their eyes focus downwards. Bald eagles also regularly exploit water turbines which produce battered, stunned or dead fish easily consumed. Predators who leave behind scraps of dead fish that they kill, such as brown bears (&quot;Ursus arctos&quot;), gray wolves (&quot;Canis lupus&quot;) and red foxes (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;), may be habitually followed in order to scavenge the kills secondarily. Once North Pacific salmon die off after spawning, usually local bald eagles eat salmon carcasses almost exclusively. Eagles in Washington need to consume of fish each day for survival, with adults generally consuming more than juveniles and thus reducing potential energy deficiency and increasing survival during winter.

===Birds===

Behind fish, the next most significant prey base for bald eagles are other waterbirds. The contribution of such birds to the eagle&#x27;s diet is variable, depending on the quantity and availability of fish near the water&#x27;s surface. Waterbirds can seasonally comprise from 7% to 80% of the prey selection for eagles in certain localities. Overall, birds are the most diverse group in the bald eagle&#x27;s prey spectrum, with 200 prey species recorded.

Bird species most preferred as prey by eagles tend to be medium-sized, such as western grebes (&quot;Aechmophorus occidentalis&quot;), mallards (&quot;Anas platyrhynchos&quot;), and American coots (&quot;Fulica americana&quot;) as such prey is relatively easy for the much larger eagles to catch and fly with. American herring gull (&quot;Larus smithsonianus&quot;) are the favored avian prey species for eagles living around Lake Superior. Black ducks (&quot;Anas rubripes&quot;), common eiders (&quot;Somateria mollissima&quot;), and double-crested cormorants (&quot;Phalacrocorax auritus&quot;) are also frequently taken in coastal Maine and velvet scoter (&quot;Melanitta fusca&quot;) was dominant prey in San Miguel Island.
Due to easy accessibility and lack of formidable nest defense against eagles by such species, bald eagles are capable of preying on such seabirds at all ages, from eggs to mature adults, and they can effectively cull large portions of a colony. Along some portions of the North Pacific coastline, bald eagles which had historically preyed mainly kelp-dwelling fish and supplementally sea otter (&quot;Enhydra lutris&quot;) pups are now preying mainly on seabird colonies since both the fish (possibly due to overfishing) and otters (cause unknown) have had steep population declines, causing concern for seabird conservation. Because of this more extensive predation, some biologist has expressed concern that murres are heading for a &quot;conservation collision&quot; due to heavy eagle predation. Eagles have been confirmed to attack nocturnally active, burrow-nesting seabird species such as storm petrels and shearwaters by digging out their burrows and feeding on all animals they find inside. If a bald eagle flies close by, waterbirds will often fly away en masse, though they may seemingly ignore a perched eagle in other cases. when the birds fly away from a colony, this exposes their unprotected eggs and nestlings to scavengers such as gulls.

While they usually target small to medium-sized seabirds, larger seabirds such as great black-backed gulls (&quot;Larus marinus&quot;) and northern gannets (&quot;Morus bassanus&quot;) and brown pelicans (&quot;Pelecanus occidentalis&quot;) of all ages can successfully be taken by bald eagles. Similarly, large waterbirds are occasionally killed. Geese such as wintering emperor geese (&quot;Chen canagica&quot;) and snow geese (&quot;C. caerulescens&quot;), which gather in large groups, sometimes becoming regular prey. Smaller Ross&#x27;s geese (&quot;Anser rossii&quot;) are also taken, as well as large-sized Canada geese (&quot;Branta canadensis&quot;). Predation on the largest subspecies (&quot;Branta canadensis maxima&quot;) has been reported. Other large waterbird prey include common loons (&quot;Gavia immer&quot;) of all ages. Large wading birds can also fall prey to bald eagles. For the great blue herons (&quot;Ardea herodias&quot;), bald eagles are their only serious enemies of all ages. Slightly larger Sandhill cranes (&quot;Grus canadensis&quot;) can be taken as well. While adult whooping cranes (&quot;Grus americana&quot;) are too large and formidable, their chicks can fall prey to bald eagles. They even occasionally prey on adult tundra swans (&quot;Cygnus columbianus&quot;). Young trumpeter swans (&quot;Cygnus buccinator&quot;) are also taken, and an unsuccessful attack on an adult swan has been photographed.

Bald eagles have been occasionally recorded as killing other raptors. In some cases, these may be attacks of competition or kleptoparasitism on rival species but end with the consumption of the dead victims. Nine species of other accipitrids and owls are known to have been preyed upon by bald eagles. Owl prey species have ranged in size from western screech-owls (&quot;Megascops kennicotti&quot;) to snowy owls (&quot;Bubo scandiacus&quot;). Larger diurnal raptors known to have fallen victim to bald eagles have included red-tailed hawks (&quot;Buteo jamaicensis&quot;), peregrine falcons (&quot;Falco peregrinus&quot;), northern goshawks (&quot;Accipiter gentilis&quot;), ospreys (&quot;Pandion haliaetus&quot;) and black (&quot;Coragyps atratus&quot;) and turkey vultures (&quot;Cathartes aura&quot;).

===Mammals===
Mammalian preys are generally less frequently taken than fish or avian prey. However, in some regions, such as landlocked areas of North America, wintering bald eagles may become habitual predators of medium-sized mammals that occur in colonies or local concentrations, such as prairie dogs (&quot;Cynomys&quot; sp.) and jackrabbits (&quot;Lepus&quot; sp.). Bald eagles in Seedskadee National Wildlife Refuge often hunt in pair to catch cottontails, jackrabbits and prairie dogs. They can attack and prey on rabbits and hares of nearly any size, from marsh rabbits (&quot;Sylvilagus palustris&quot;) to black and white-tailed jackrabbits (&quot;Lepus californicus&quot; &amp; &quot;L. townsendii&quot;), and Arctic hares (&quot;Lepus arcticus&quot;). In San Luis Valley, white-tailed jackrabbits can be important prey. Additionally, rodents such as montane voles (&quot;Microtus montanus&quot;), brown rats (&quot;Rattus norvegicus&quot;), and various squirrels are taken as supplementary prey. Larger rodents such as muskrats (&quot;Ondatra zibethicus&quot;), young or small adult nutrias (&quot;Myocastor coypus&quot;) and groundhogs (&quot;Marmota monax&quot;) are also preyed upon. Even American porcupines (&quot;Erethizon dorsatum&quot;) are reportedly attacked and killed.

Where available, seal colonies can provide a lot of food. On Protection Island, Washington, they commonly feed on harbor seal (&quot;Phoca vitulina&quot;) afterbirths, still-borns and sickly seal pups. Similarly, bald eagles in Alaska readily prey on sea otter (&quot;Enhydra lutris&quot;) pups. Small to medium-sized terrestrial mammalian carnivores can be taken infrequently. Mustelid including American martens (&quot;Martes pennanti&quot;), American minks (&quot;Neogale vison&quot;), and larger fisher cats (&quot;Pekania pennanti&quot;) are known to be hunted. Foxes are also taken, including Island foxes (&quot; Urocyon littoralis &quot;), Arctic foxes (&quot;Vulpes lagopus&quot;), and grey foxes (&quot;Urocyon cinereoargenteus&quot;). Although fox farmers claimed that bald eagle heavily prey on young and adult free-range Arctic fox, the predation events are sporadic. In one instance, two bald Eagles fed upon a red fox (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;) that had tried to cross a frozen Delaware Lake. Other medium-sized carnivorans such as striped skunks (&quot;Mephitis mephitis&quot;), American hog-nosed skunks (&quot;Conepatus leuconotus&quot;), and common raccoons (&quot;Procyon lotor&quot;) are taken, as well as domestic cats (&quot;Felis catus&quot;) and dogs (&quot;canis familiaris&quot;).

Other wild mammalian prey include fawns of deer such as white-tailed deer (&quot;Odocoileus virginianus&quot;) and Sitka deer (&quot;Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis&quot;), which weigh around can be taken alive by bald eagles. In one instance, a bald eagle was observed carrying mule deer (&quot;Odocoileus hemionus&quot;) fawn. Additionally, Virginia opossums (&quot;Didelphis virginiana&quot;) can be preyed upon. Still, predation events are rare due to their nocturnal habits.

Together with the golden eagle, bald eagles are occasionally accused of preying on livestock, especially sheep (&quot;Ovis aries&quot;). There are a handful of proven cases of lamb predation, some specimens weighing up to , by bald eagles. Still, they are much less likely to attack a healthy lamb than a golden eagle. Both species prefer native, wild prey and are unlikely to cause any extensive detriment to human livelihoods. There is one case of a bald eagle killing and feeding on an adult, pregnant ewe (then joined in eating the kill by at least 3 other eagles), which, weighing on average over , is much larger than any other known prey taken by this species.

===Reptiles and other prey===
Supplemental prey is readily taken given the opportunity. In some areas, reptiles may become regular prey, especially in warm areas such as Florida where reptile diversity is high. Turtles are perhaps the most regularly hunted type of reptile. In coastal New Jersey, 14 of 20 studied eagle nests included remains of turtles. The main species found were common musk turtles (&quot;Sternotherus odoratus&quot;), diamondback terrapin (&quot;Malaclemys terrapin&quot;) and juvenile common snapping turtles (&quot;Chelydra serpentina&quot;). In these New Jersey nests, mainly subadult and small adults were taken, ranging in carapace length from . Similarly, many turtles were recorded in the diet in the Chesapeake Bay. In Texas, softshell turtles are the most frequently taken prey, and a large number of Barbour&#x27;s map turtles are taken in Torreya State Park. Other reptilian and amphibian prey includes southern alligator lizards (&quot;Elgaria multicarinata&quot;), snakes such as garter snakes and rattlesnakes, and Greater siren (&quot;Siren lacertina&quot;).

Invertebrates are occasionally taken. In Alaska, eagles feed on sea urchins (&quot;Strongylocentrotus&quot; sp.), chitons, mussels, and crabs. Other various mollusks such as land snails, abalones, bivalves, periwinkles, blue mussels, squids, and starfishes are taken as well.

=== Interspecific predatory relationships ===

When competing for food, eagles will usually dominate other fish-eaters and scavengers, aggressively displacing mammals such as coyotes (&quot;Canis latrans&quot;) and foxes, and birds such as corvids, gulls, vultures and other raptors. Occasionally, coyotes, bobcats (&quot;Lynx rufus&quot;) and domestic dogs (&quot;Canis familiaris&quot;) can displace eagles from carrion, usually less confident immature birds, as has been recorded in Maine. Bald eagles are less active, bold predators than golden eagles and get relatively more of their food as carrion and from kleptoparasitism (although it is now generally thought that golden eagles eat more carrion than was previously assumed). However, the two species are roughly equal in size, aggressiveness and physical strength and so competitions can go either way. Neither species is known to be dominant, and the outcome depends on the size and disposition of the individual eagles involved. Wintering bald and golden eagles in Utah both sometimes won conflicts, though in one recorded instance a single bald eagle successfully displaced two consecutive golden eagles from a kill.

Though bald eagles face few natural threats, an unusual attacker comes in the form of the common loon (&quot;G. immer&quot;), which is also taken by eagles as prey. While common loons normally avoid conflict, they are highly territorial and will attack predators and competitors by stabbing at them with their knife-like bill; as the range of the bald eagle has increased following conservation efforts, these interactions have been observed on several occasions, including a fatality of a bald eagle in Maine that is presumed to have come about as a result of it attacking a nest, then having a fatal puncture wound inflicted by one or both loon parents.

The bald eagle is thought to be much more numerous in North America than the golden eagle, with the bald species estimated to number at least 150,000 individuals, about twice as many golden eagles there are estimated to live in North America. Due to this, bald eagles often outnumber golden eagles at attractive food sources. Despite the potential for contention between these animals, in New Jersey during winter, a golden eagle and numerous bald eagles were observed to hunt snow geese alongside each other without conflict. Similarly, both eagle species have been recorded, via video-monitoring, to feed on gut piles and carcasses of white-tailed deer (&quot;Odocoileus virginianus&quot;) in remote forest clearings in the eastern Appalachian Mountains without apparent conflict. Bald eagles are frequently mobbed by smaller raptors, due to their infrequent but unpredictable tendency to hunt other birds of prey. Many bald eagles are habitual kleptoparasites, especially in winters when fish are harder to come by. They have been recorded stealing fish from other predators such as ospreys, herons and even otters. They have also been recorded opportunistically pirating birds from peregrine falcons (&quot;Falco peregrinus&quot;), prairie dogs from ferruginous hawks (&quot;Buteo regalis&quot;) and even jackrabbits from golden eagles. When they approach scavengers such as dogs, gulls or vultures at carrion sites, they often attack them in an attempt to force them to disgorge their food. Healthy adult bald eagles are not preyed upon in the wild and are thus considered apex predators.

==Reproduction==
Bald eagles are sexually mature at four or five years of age. When they are old enough to breed, they often return to the area where they were born. Bald eagles have high mate fidelity and generally mate for life. However, if one pair member dies or disappears, the survivor will choose a new mate. A pair that has repeatedly failed in breeding attempts may split and look for new mates. Bald eagle courtship involves elaborate, spectacular calls and flight displays by the males. The flight includes swoops, chases, and cartwheels, in which they fly high, lock talons, and free-fall, separating just before hitting the ground. Usually, a territory defended by a mature pair will be of waterside habitat.
Compared to most other raptors, which mostly nest in April or May, bald eagles are early breeders: nest building or reinforcing is often by mid-February, egg laying is often late February (sometimes during deep snow in the North), and incubation is usually mid-March and early May. Eggs hatch from mid-April to early May, and the young fledge from late June to early July. The nest is the largest of any bird in North America; it is used repeatedly over many years and with new material added each year may eventually be as large as deep, across and weigh . One nest in Florida was found to be deep, across, and to weigh . This nest is on record as the largest tree nest ever recorded for any animal. Usually nests are used for under five years, as they either collapse in storms or break the branches supporting them by their sheer weight. However, one nest in the Midwest was occupied continuously for at least 34 years. The nest is built of branches, usually in large trees found near water. When breeding where there are no trees, the bald eagle will nest on the ground, as has been recorded largely in areas largely isolated from terrestrial predators, such as Amchitka Island in Alaska.
In Sonora, Mexico, eagles have been observed nesting on top of hecho catcuses (&quot;Pachycereus pectin-aboriginum&quot;). Nests located on cliffs and rock pinnacles have been reported historically in California, Kansas, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah, but currently are only verified to occur only in Alaska and Arizona. The eggs average about long, ranging from , and have a breadth of , ranging from . Eggs in Alaska averaged in mass, while in Saskatchewan they averaged . As with their ultimate body size, egg size tends to increase with distance from the equator. Eagles produce between one and three eggs per year, two being typical. Rarely, four eggs have been found in nests, but these may be exceptional cases of polygyny. Eagles in captivity have been capable of producing up to seven eggs. It is rare for all three chicks to successfully reach the fledgling stage. The oldest chick often bears the advantage of a larger size and louder voice, which tends to draw the parents&#x27; attention towards it. Occasionally, as is recorded in many large raptorial birds, the oldest sibling sometimes attacks and kills its younger sibling(s), especially early in the nesting period when their sizes are most different. However, nearly half of the known bald eagles produce two fledglings (more rarely three), unlike in some other &quot;eagle&quot; species such as some in the genus &quot;Aquila&quot;, in which a second fledgling is typically observed in less than 20% of nests, despite two eggs typically being laid. Both the male and female take turns incubating the eggs, but the female does most of the sitting. The parent not incubating will hunt for food or look for nesting material during this stage. For the first two to three weeks of the nestling period, at least one adult is at the nest almost 100% of the time. After five to six weeks, the attendance of parents usually drops off considerably (with the parents often perching in trees nearby).

A young eaglet can gain up to a day, the fastest growth rate of any North American bird. The young eaglets pick up and manipulate sticks, play tug of war with each other, practice holding things in their talons, and stretch and flap their wings. By eight weeks, the eaglets are strong enough to flap their wings, lift their feet off the nest platform, and rise in the air. The young fledge at anywhere from 8 to 14 weeks of age, though will remain close to the nest and be attended to by their parents for a further 6 weeks. Juvenile eagles first start dispersing away from their parents about 8 weeks after they fledge. Variability in departure date related to effects of sex and hatching order on growth and development. For the next four years, immature eagles wander widely in search of food until they attain adult plumage and are eligible to reproduce.

Male eagles have been observed killing and cannibalizing their chicks. In 2024 at the National Conservation Training Center in West Virginia, the NCTC&#x27;s Eagle Cam recorded two bald eagle chicks being attacked and devoured by their father as soon as the mother departed from the nest. The NCTC noted in its statement on the incident that such behavior &quot;has been observed in other nests and is not uncommon in birds of prey.&quot;

On rare occasions, bald eagles have been recorded to adopt other raptor fledglings into their nests, as seen in 2017 by a pair of eagles in Shoal Harbor Migratory Bird Sanctuary near Sidney, British Columbia. The pair of eagles in question are believed to have carried a juvenile red-tailed hawk back to their nest, presumably as prey, whereupon the chick was accepted into the family by both the parents and the eagles&#x27; three nestlings. The hawk, nicknamed &quot;Spunky&quot; by biologists monitoring the nest, fledged successfully.

==Longevity and mortality==

The average lifespan of bald eagles in the wild is around 20 years, with the oldest confirmed one having been 38 years of age. In captivity, they often live somewhat longer. In one instance, a captive individual in New York lived for nearly 50 years. As with size, the average lifespan of an eagle population appears to be influenced by its location and access to prey. As they are no longer heavily persecuted, adult mortality is quite low. In one study of Florida eagles, adult bald eagles reportedly had 100% annual survival rate. In Prince William Sound in Alaska, adults had an annual survival rate of 88% even after the Exxon Valdez oil spill adversely affected eagles in the area. Of 1,428 individuals from across the range necropsied by National Wildlife Health Center from 1963 to 1984, 329 (23%) eagles died from trauma, primarily impact with wires and vehicles; 309 (22%) died from gunshot; 158 (11%) died from poisoning; 130 (9%) died from electrocution; 68 (5%) died from trapping; 110 (8%) from emaciation; and 31 (2%) from disease; cause of death was undetermined in 293 (20%) of cases. In this study, 68% of mortality was human-caused. Today, eagle-shooting is believed to be considerably reduced due to the species&#x27; protected status. A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service study of 1,490 bald eagle deaths from 1986 through 2017 in Michigan found that 532 (36%) died due to being struck by cars while scavenging roadkill and 176 (12%) died due to lead poisoning from ingesting fragments of lead ammo and fishing gear present in carrion, with the proportion of both causes of death increasing significantly towards the end of the study period.

Most non-human-related mortality involves nestlings or eggs. Around 50% of eagles survive their first year. However, in the Chesapeake Bay area, 100% of 39 radio-tagged nestlings survived to their first year. Nestling or egg fatalities may be due to nest collapses, starvation, sibling aggression or inclement weather. Another significant cause of egg and nestling mortality is predation. Nest predators include large gulls, corvids (including ravens, crows and magpies), wolverines (&quot;Gulo gulo&quot;), fishers (&quot;Pekania pennanti&quot;), red-tailed hawks, owls, other eagles, bobcats, American black bears (&quot;Ursus americanus&quot;) and raccoons. If food access is low, parental attendance at the nest may be lower because both parents may have to forage, thus resulting in less protection. Nestlings are usually exempt from predation by terrestrial carnivores that are poor tree-climbers, but Arctic foxes (&quot;Vulpes lagopus&quot;) occasionally snatched nestlings from ground nests on Amchitka Island in Alaska before they were extirpated from the island. The bald eagle will defend its nest fiercely from all comers and has even repelled attacks from bears, having been recorded knocking a black bear out of a tree when the latter tried to climb a tree holding nestlings.

==Relationship with humans==

===Population decline and recovery===

Once a common sight in much of the continent, the bald eagle was severely affected in the mid-20th century by a variety of factors, among them the thinning of egg shells attributed to use of the pesticide DDT. Bald eagles, like many birds of prey, were especially affected by DDT due to biomagnification. DDT itself was not lethal to the adult bird, but it interfered with their calcium metabolism, making them either sterile or unable to lay healthy eggs; many of their eggs were too brittle to withstand the weight of a brooding adult, making it nearly impossible for them to hatch. It is estimated that in the early 18th century the bald eagle population was 300,000â500,000, but by the 1950s there were only 412 nesting pairs in the 48 contiguous states of the US.
Other factors in bald eagle population reductions were a widespread loss of suitable habitat, as well as both legal and illegal shooting. In 1930 a New York City ornithologist wrote that in the territory of Alaska in the previous 12 years approximately 70,000 bald eagles had been shot. Many of the hunters killed the bald eagles under the long-held beliefs that bald eagles grabbed young lambs and even children with their talons, yet the birds were innocent of most of these alleged acts of predation (lamb predation is rare, human predation is thought to be non-existent). Illegal shooting was described as &quot;the leading cause of direct mortality in both adult and immature bald eagles&quot; by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1978. Leading causes of death in bald eagles include lead pollution, poisoning, collision with motor vehicles, and power-line electrocution. A study published in 2022 in the journal Science found that more than half of adult eagles across 38 US states suffered from lead poisoning. The primary cause is when eagles scavenge carcasses of animals shot by hunters. These are often tainted with lead shotgun pellets, rifle rounds, or fishing tackle.

The species was first protected in the U.S. and Canada by the 1918 Migratory Bird Treaty, later extended to all of North America. The Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, approved by the U.S. Congress in 1940, protected the bald eagle and the golden eagle, prohibiting commercial trapping and killing of the birds as well as collecting their eggs. The bald eagle was declared an endangered species in the U.S. in 1967, and amendments to the 1940 act between 1962 and 1972 further restricted commercial uses and increased penalties for violators. Perhaps most significant in the species&#x27; recovery, in 1972, DDT was banned from usage in the United States due to the fact that it inhibited the reproduction of many birds. DDT was completely banned in Canada in 1989, though its use had been highly restricted since the late 1970s.
With regulations in place and DDT banned, the eagle population rebounded. The bald eagle can be found in growing concentrations throughout the United States and Canada, particularly near large bodies of water. In the early 1980s, the estimated total population was 100,000 individuals, with 110,000â115,000 by 1992; the U.S. state with the largest resident population is Alaska, with about 40,000â50,000, with the next highest population the Canadian province of British Columbia with 20,000â30,000 in 1992. Obtaining a precise count of the bald eagle population is extremely difficult. The most recent data submitted by individual states was in 2006, when 9789 breeding pairs were reported. For some time, the stronghold breeding population of bald eagles in the lower 48 states was in Florida, where over a thousand pairs have held on while populations in other states were significantly reduced by DDT use. Today, the contiguous state with the largest number of breeding pairs of eagles is Minnesota with an estimated 1,312 pairs, surpassing Florida&#x27;s most recent count of 1,166 pairs. 23, or nearly half, of the 48 contiguous states now have at least 100 breeding pairs of bald eagles. In Washington State, there were only 105 occupied nests in 1980. That number increased by about 30 per year, so that by 2005 there were 840 occupied nests. 2005 was the last year that the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife counted occupied nests. Further population increases in Washington may be limited by the availability of late winter food, particularly salmon.

The bald eagle was officially removed from the U.S. federal government&#x27;s list of endangered species on July 12, 1995, by the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, when it was reclassified from &quot;endangered&quot; to &quot;threatened&quot;. On July 6, 1999, a proposal was initiated &quot;To Remove the Bald Eagle in the Lower 48 States From the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife&quot;. It was de-listed on June 28, 2007. It has also been assigned a risk level of least concern category on the IUCN Red List. In the &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; oil spill of 1989 an estimated 247 were killed in Prince William Sound, though the local population returned to its pre-spill level by 1995. In some areas, the increase in eagles has led to decreases in other bird populations and the eagles may be considered a pest.

===Killing permits===
In December 2016, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed extending the permits issued to wind generation companies to allow them to kill up to 4,200 bald eagles per year without facing a penalty, four times the previous number. The permits would last 30 years, six times the previous 5-year term.

===In captivity===

Permits are required to keep bald eagles in captivity in the United States. Permits are primarily issued to public educational institutions, and the eagles that they show are permanently injured individuals that cannot be released to the wild. The facilities where eagles are kept must be equipped with adequate caging, as well as workers experienced in the handling and care of eagles. The bald eagle can be long-lived in captivity if well cared for, but does not breed well even under the best conditions.

In Canada and in England a license is required to keep bald eagles for falconry. Bald eagles cannot legally be kept for falconry in the United States, but a license may be issued in some jurisdictions to allow use of such eagles in birds-of-prey flight shows.

==Cultural significance==
The bald eagle is important in various Native American cultures and, as the national symbol of the United States, is prominent in seals and logos, coinage, postage stamps, and other items relating to the U.S. federal government.

===Role in Native American culture===
The bald eagle is a sacred bird in some North American cultures, and its feathers, like those of the golden eagle, are central to many religious and spiritual customs among Native Americans. Eagles are considered spiritual messengers between gods and humans by some cultures. Many pow wow dancers use the eagle claw as part of their regalia as well. Eagle feathers are often used in traditional ceremonies, particularly in the construction of regalia worn and as a part of fans, bustles and head dresses. In the Navajo tradition an eagle feather is represented to be a protector, along with the feather Navajo medicine men use the leg and wing bones for ceremonial whistles. The Lakota, for instance, give an eagle feather as a symbol of honor to person who achieves a task. In modern times, it may be given on an event such as a graduation from college. The Pawnee consider eagles as symbols of fertility because their nests are built high off the ground and because they fiercely protect their young. The Choctaw consider the bald eagle, who has direct contact with the upper world of the sun, as a symbol of peace.
During the Sun Dance, which is practiced by many Plains Indian tribes, the eagle is represented in several ways. The eagle nest is represented by the fork of the lodge where the dance is held. A whistle made from the wing bone of an eagle is used during the course of the dance. Also during the dance, a medicine man may direct his fan, which is made of eagle feathers, to people who seek to be healed. The medicine man touches the fan to the center pole and then to the patient, in order to transmit power from the pole to the patient. The fan is then held up toward the sky, so that the eagle may carry the prayers for the sick to the Creator.

Current eagle feather law stipulates that only individuals of certifiable Native American ancestry enrolled in a federally recognized tribe are legally authorized to obtain or possess bald or golden eagle feathers for religious or spiritual use. The constitutionality of these laws has been questioned by Native American groups on the basis that it violates the First Amendment by affecting ability to practice their religion freely.

The National Eagle Repository, a division of the FWS, exists as a means to receive, process, and store bald and golden eagles which are found dead and to distribute the eagles, their parts and feathers to federally recognized Native American tribes for use in religious ceremonies.

===National symbol of the United States===
The bald eagle is the national symbol of the United States. It was adopted as a national emblem in 1782, but not designated the &quot;national bird&quot; until an act of Congress in December 2024.

The founders of the United States were fond of comparing their new republic with the Roman Republic, in which eagle imagery (usually involving the golden eagle) was prominent. On June 20, 1782, the Continental Congress adopted the design for the Great Seal of the United States, depicting a bald eagle grasping 13 arrows and an olive branch with thirteen leaves with its talons.

The bald eagle appears on most official seals of the U.S. government, including the presidential seal, the presidential flag, and in the logos of many U.S. federal agencies. Between 1916 and 1945, the presidential flag (but not the seal) showed an eagle facing to its left (the viewer&#x27;s right), which gave rise to the urban legend that the flag is changed to have the eagle face towards the olive branch in peace, and towards the arrows in wartime.

Contrary to popular legend, there is no evidence that Benjamin Franklin ever publicly supported the wild turkey (&quot;Meleagris gallopavo&quot;), rather than the bald eagle, as a symbol of the United States. However, in a letter written to his daughter in 1784 from Paris, criticizing the Society of the Cincinnati, he stated his personal distaste for the bald eagle&#x27;s behavior. In the letter Franklin states:

Franklin opposed the creation of the Society because he viewed it, with its hereditary membership, as a noble order unwelcome in the newly independent Republic, contrary to the ideals of Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, for whom the Society was named. His reference to the two kinds of birds is interpreted as a satirical comparison between the Society of the Cincinnati and Cincinnatus.

===Popular culture===
Largely because of its role as a symbol of the United States, but also because of its being a large predator, the bald eagle has many representations in popular culture. In film and television depictions the call of the red-tailed hawk, which is much louder and more powerful, is often substituted for bald eagles.

<text>The brown bear (Ursus arctos) is a large bear native to Eurasia and North America. Of the land carnivorans, it is rivaled in size only by its closest relative, the polar bear, which is much less variable in size and slightly bigger on average. The brown bear is a sexually dimorphic species, as adult males are larger and more compactly built than females. The fur ranges in color from cream to reddish to dark brown. It has evolved large hump muscles, unique among bears, and paws up to wide and long, to effectively dig through dirt. Its teeth are similar to those of other bears and reflect its dietary plasticity.

Throughout the brown bear&#x27;s range, it inhabits mainly forested habitats in elevations of up to . It is omnivorous, and consumes a variety of plant and animal species. Contrary to popular belief, the brown bear derives 90% of its diet from plants. When hunting, it will target animals as small as insects and rodents to those as large as moose or muskoxen. In parts of coastal Alaska, brown bears predominantly feed on spawning salmon that come near shore to lay their eggs. For most of the year, it is a usually solitary animal that associates only when mating or raising cubs. Females give birth to an average of one to three cubs that remain with their mother for 1.5 to 4.5 years. It is a long-lived animal, with an average lifespan of 25 years in the wild. Relative to its body size, the brown bear has an exceptionally large brain. This large brain allows for high cognitive abilities, such as tool use. Attacks on humans, though widely reported, are generally rare.

While the brown bear&#x27;s range has shrunk, and it has faced local extinctions across its wide range, it remains listed as a least concern species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) with a total estimated population in 2017 of 110,000. Populations that were hunted to extinction in the 19th and 20th centuries are the Atlas bear of North Africa and the Californian, Ungavan and Mexican populations of the grizzly bear of North America. Many of the populations in the southern parts of Eurasia are highly endangered as well. One of the smaller-bodied forms, the Himalayan brown bear, is critically endangered: it occupies only 2% of its former range and is threatened by uncontrolled poaching for its body parts. The Marsican brown bear of central Italy is one of several currently isolated populations of the Eurasian brown bear and is believed to have a population of only about 50 bears.

The brown bear is considered to be one of the most popular of the world&#x27;s charismatic megafauna. It has been kept in zoos since ancient times, and has been tamed and trained to perform in circuses and other acts. For thousands of years, the brown bear has had a role in human culture, and is often featured in literature, art, folklore, and mythology.

==Etymology==
The brown bear is sometimes referred to as the , from Middle English. This name originated in the fable &quot;History of Reynard the Fox&quot;, translated by William Caxton, from the Middle Dutch word or , meaning &quot;brown&quot;. In the mid-19th-century United States, the brown bear was given the nicknames &quot;Old Ephraim&quot; and &quot;Moccasin Joe&quot;.

The scientific name of the brown bear, &quot;Ursus arctos&quot;, comes from the Latin , meaning &quot;bear&quot;, and the Greek /, also meaning &quot;bear&quot;.

==Evolution and taxonomy==

===Taxonomy and subspecies===

Carl Linnaeus scientifically described the species under the name &quot;Ursus arctos&quot; in the 1758 edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. Brown bear taxonomy and subspecies classification has been described as &quot;formidable and confusing&quot;, with few authorities listing the same set of subspecies. There are hundreds of obsolete brown-bear subspecies. As many as 90 subspecies have been proposed. A 2008 DNA analysis identified as few as five main clades, which comprise all extant brown bear species, while a 2017 phylogenetic study revealed nine clades, including one representing polar bears. , 15 extant, or recently extinct, subspecies were recognized by the general scientific community.

DNA analysis shows that, apart from recent, human-caused population fragmentation, brown bears in North America are generally part of a single interconnected population system, with the exception of the population (or subspecies) in the Kodiak Archipelago, which has probably been isolated since the end of the last Ice Age. These data demonstrate that &quot;U. a. gyas&quot;, &quot;U. a. horribilis&quot;, &quot;U. a. sitkensis&quot;, and &quot;U. a. stikeenensis&quot; are not distinct or cohesive groups, and would more accurately be described as ecotypes. For example, brown bears in any particular region of the Alaska coast are more closely related to adjacent grizzly bears than to distant populations of brown bears.

The history of the bears of the Alexander Archipelago is unusual in that these island populations carry polar bear DNA, presumably originating from a population of polar bears that was left behind at the end of the Pleistocene, but have since been connected with adjacent mainland populations through the movement of males, to the point where their nuclear genomes indicate more than 90% brown bear ancestry. MtDNA analysis revealed that brown bears are apparently divided into five different clades, some of which coexist or co-occur in different regions.

===Evolution===
The brown bear is one of eight extant species in the bear family Ursidae and of six extant species in the subfamily Ursinae. 

The brown bear is thought to have evolved from the Etruscan bear (&quot;Ursus etruscus&quot;) in Asia during the early Pliocene. A genetic analysis indicated that the brown bear lineage diverged from the cave bear species-complex approximately 1.2â1.4Â million years ago, but did not clarify if &quot;U. savini&quot; persisted as a paraspecies for the brown bear before perishing. The oldest brown bear fossils occur in Asia from about 500,000 to 300,000 years ago. They entered Europe 250,000 years ago and North Africa shortly after. Brown bear remains from the Pleistocene period are common in the British Isles, where, amongst other factors, they may have contributed to the extinction of cave bears (&quot;Ursus spelaeus&quot;).

Brown bears first emigrated to North America from Eurasia via Beringia during the Illinoian Glaciation. Genetic evidence suggests that several brown bear populations migrated into North America, aligning with the glacial cycles of the Pleistocene. The founding population of most North American brown bears arrived first, with the genetic lineage developing around ~177,000 BP. Genetic divergences suggest that brown bears first migrated south during MIS-5 (~92,000â83,000 BP), upon the opening of the ice-free corridor, After a local extinction in Beringia ~33,000 BP, two new but closely related lineages repopulated Alaska and northern Canada from Eurasia after the Last Glacial Maximum (&gt;25,000 BP).

Brown-bear fossils discovered in Ontario, Ohio, Kentucky, and Labrador show that the species occurred farther east than indicated in historic records. In North America, two types of the subspecies &quot;Ursus arctos horribilis&quot; are generally recognizedâthe coastal brown bear and the inland grizzly bear.

===Hybrids===

A grizzlyâpolar bear hybrid is a rare ursid hybrid resulting from a crossbreeding of a brown bear with a polar bear. It has occurred both in captivity and in the wild. In 2006, the occurrence of this hybrid was confirmed by testing the DNA of a strange-looking bear that had been shot in the Canadian Arctic, and seven more hybrids have since been confirmed in the same region, all descended from a single female polar bear. Previously, the hybrid had been produced in zoos and was considered a &quot;cryptid&quot; (a hypothesized animal for which there is no scientific proof of existence in the wild). Analyses of the genomes of bears have shown that introgression between species was widespread during the evolution of the genus &quot;Ursus&quot;, including the introgression of polar-bear DNA introduced to brown bears during the Pleistocene.

==Description==

===Size===

The brown bear is the most variable in size of modern bears. The typical size depends upon which population it is from, as most accepted subtypes vary widely in size. This is in part due to sexual dimorphism, as male brown bears average at least 30% larger than females in most subtypes. Individual bears vary in size seasonally, weighing the least in spring due to lack of foraging during hibernation, and the most in late fall, after a period of hyperphagia to put on additional weight to prepare for hibernation.

Brown bears generally weigh , with males outweighing females. They have a head-and-body length of and a shoulder height of . The tail is relatively short, as in all bears, ranging from in length. The smallest brown bears, females during spring among barren-ground populations, can weigh so little as to roughly match the body mass of males of the smallest living bear species, the sun bear (&quot;Helarctos malayanus&quot;), while the largest coastal populations attain sizes broadly similar to those of the largest living bear species, the polar bear. Brown bears of the interior are generally smaller, being around the same weight as an average lion, at an average of in males and in females, whereas adults of the coastal populations weigh about twice as much. The average weight of adult male bears, from 19 populations, was found to be while adult females from 24 populations were found to average .

===Coloration===
Brown bears are often not fully brown. They have long, thick fur, with a moderately elongated mane at the back of the neck which varies somewhat across bear types. In India, brown bears can be reddish with silver-tipped hairs, while in China, brown bears are bicolored, with a yellowish-brown or whitish collar across the neck, chest, and shoulders. Even within well-defined subspecies, individuals may show highly variable hues of brown. North American grizzlies can be from dark brown (almost black) to cream (almost white) or yellowish-brown and often have darker-colored legs. The common name &quot;grizzly&quot; stems from their typical coloration, with the hairs on their back usually being brownish-black at the base and whitish-cream at the tips, giving them their distinctive &quot;grizzled&quot; color. Apart from the cinnamon subspecies of the American black bear (&quot;U. americanus cinnamonum&quot;), the brown bear is the only modern bear species to typically appear truly brown. The brown bear&#x27;s winter fur is very thick and long, especially in northern subspecies, and can reach at the withers. The winter hairs are thin, yet rough to the touch. The summer fur is much shorter and sparser, with its length and density varying among geographic ranges.

===Cranial morphology and size===
Adults have massive, heavily built, concave skulls, which are large in proportion to the body. The projections of the skull are well developed. Skull lengths of Russian brown bears tend to be for males, and for females. Brown bears have the broadest skull of any extant ursine bear. The width of the zygomatic arches in males is , and in females. Brown bears have strong jaws: the incisors and canine teeth are large, with the lower canines being strongly curved. The first three molars of the upper jaw are underdeveloped and single-crowned with one root. The second upper molar is smaller than the others, and is usually absent in adults. It is usually lost at an early age, leaving no trace of its alveolus in the jaw. The first three molars of the lower jaw are very weak, and are often lost at an early age. The teeth of brown bears reflect their dietary plasticity and are broadly similar to those of other bears. They are reliably larger than teeth of American black bears, but average smaller in molar length than those of polar bears.

===Claws and feet===
Brown bears have large, curved claws, with the front ones being larger than the back. They may reach and measure along the curve. Compared with the American black bear (&quot;Ursus americanus&quot;), the brown bear has longer and stronger claws, with a blunt curve. Due to their claw structure, in addition to their excessive weight, adult brown bears are not able to climb trees as well as black bears. In rare cases adult female brown bears have been seen scaling trees. The claws of a polar bear are quite different, being notably shorter but broader with a strong curve and sharper point. The species has large paws; the rear feet measure long, while the forefeet tend to measure 40% less. Brown bears are the only extant bears with a hump at the top of their shoulder, which is made entirely of muscle. This feature developed presumably to impart more force in digging, which helps during foraging and facilitates den construction prior to hibernation.

==Distribution and habitat==

Brown bears inhabit the broadest range of habitats of any living bear species. They seem to have no altitudinal preferences and have been recorded from sea level to an elevation of in the Himalayas. In most of their range, brown bears seem to prefer semi-open country, with a scattering of vegetation, that can allow them a resting spot during the day. However, they have been recorded as inhabiting every variety of northern temperate forest known to occur.

This species was once native to Europe, much of Asia, the Atlas Mountains of Africa, and North America, but are now extirpated in some areas, and their populations have greatly decreased in other areas. There are approximately 200,000 brown bears left in the world. The largest populations are in Russia with 130,000, the United States with 32,500, and Canada with around 25,000. Brown bears live in Alaska, east through the Yukon and Northwest Territories, south through British Columbia, and through the western half of Alberta. The Alaskan population is estimated at a healthy 30,000 individuals. In the lower 48 states, they are repopulating slowly, but steadily along the Rockies and the western Great Plains.

In Europe, in 2010, there were 14,000 brown bears in ten fragmented populations, from Spain (estimated at only 20â25 animals in the Pyrenees in 2010, in a range shared between Spain, France, and Andorra, and some 210 animals in Asturias, Cantabria, Galicia, and LeÃ³n, in the Picos de Europa and adjacent areas in 2013) in the west, to Russia in the east, and from Sweden and Finland in the north to Romania (5,000â6,000), Bulgaria (900â1,200), Slovakia (with about 600â800 animals), Slovenia (500â700 animals), and Greece (with Karamanlidis et al. 2015 estimating &gt;450 animals) in the south. In Asia, brown bears are found primarily throughout Russia, thence more spottily southwest to parts of the Middle East, including the Eastern Black Sea Region, Turkey which has 5,432 individuals of brown bear, to as far south as southwestern Iran, and to the southeast in Northeast China. Brown bears are also found in Western China, Kyrgyzstan, North Korea, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India. A population of brown bears can be found on the Japanese island of HokkaidÅ, which holds the largest number of non-Russian brown bears in eastern Asia, with about 2,000â3,000 animals.

===Conservation status===
While the brown bear&#x27;s range has shrunk and it has faced local extinctions, it remains listed as a least-concern species by the IUCN, with a total population of approximately 200,000. , the brown bear and the American black bear are the only bear species not classified as threatened by the IUCN. However, the California grizzly bear, Ungava brown bear, Atlas bear, and Mexican grizzly bear, as well as brown bear populations in the Pacific Northwest, were hunted to extinction in the 19th and early 20th centuries and many of the southern Asian subspecies are highly endangered. The Syrian brown bear (&quot;U. a. syriacus&quot;) is very rare and it has been extirpated from more than half of its historic range. One of the smallest-bodied subspecies, the Himalayan brown bear (&quot;U. a. isabellinus&quot;), is critically endangered: it occupies only 2% of its former range and is threatened by uncontrolled poaching for its body parts. The Marsican brown bear in central Italy is believed to have a population of just 50 bears.

The smallest populations are most vulnerable to habitat loss and fragmentation, whereas the largest are primarily threatened by overhunting. The use of land for agriculture may negatively effect brown bears. Additionally, roads and railway tracks could pose a serious threat, as oncoming vehicles may collide with crossing animals. Poaching has been cited as another mortality factor. In one instance, a 3-year-long survey in the Russian Far East detected the illegal shipping of brown bear gallbladders to Southeast Asian countries. The purpose and motive behind the trade is unknown.

An action plan in 2000 aimed to conserve brown bears in Europe by mitigating humanâwildlife conflict, educating farm owners as to sustainable practices, and preserving and expanding remaining forests. Compensation was given to people who suffered losses of livestock, food supplies, or shelter. Growing bear populations were recorded in some countries, such as Sweden, where an increase of 1.5% per annum occurred between the 1940s and 1990s. Brown bears in Central Asia are primarily threatened by climate change. In response to this, conservationists plan on building wildlife corridors to promote easy access from one brown bear population to another. In Himalayan Nepal, farmers may kill brown bears in revenge for livestock predation.

==Behavior and life history==
A 2014 study revealed that brown bears peaked in activity around the morning and early evening hours. Although activity can happen day or night, bears that live in locations where they are apt to interact with humans are more likely to be fully nocturnal. 
In areas with little interaction, many adult bears are primarily crepuscular, while yearlings and newly independent bears appear to be most active throughout the day. From summer through autumn, a brown bear can double its weight from what it was in the spring, gaining up to of fat, on which it relies to make it through winter, when it becomes lethargic. Although they are not full hibernators and can be woken easily, both sexes prefer to den in a protected spot during the winter months. Hibernation dens may be located at any spot that provides cover from the elements and that can accommodate their bodies, such as a cave, crevice, cavernous tree roots, or hollow logs.

Brown bears have one of the largest brains of any extant carnivoran relative to their body size and have been shown to engage in tool use, which requires advanced cognitive abilities. This species is mostly solitary, although bears may gather in large numbers at major food sources (e.g., open garbage dumps or rivers containing spawning salmon) and form social hierarchies based on age and size. Adult male bears are particularly aggressive and are avoided by adolescent and subadult males, both at concentrated feeding opportunities and chance encounters. Females with cubs rival adult males in aggression and are much more intolerant of other bears than single females. Young adolescent males tend to be least aggressive and have been observed in nonantagonistic interactions with each other. Dominance between bears is asserted by making a frontal orientation, showing off canine teeth, muzzle twisting, and neck stretching, to which a subordinate will respond with a lateral orientation, by turning away and dropping the head, and by sitting or lying down. During combat, bears use their paws to strike their opponents in the chest or shoulders and bite the head or neck.

===Communication===
Several different facial expressions have been documented in brown bears. The &quot;relaxed-face&quot; is made during everyday activities, a face where the ears pointed to the sides and the mouth closed or slackly open. During social play, bears make &quot;relaxed open-mouth face&quot; in which the mouth is open, with a curled upper lip and hanging lower lip, and the ears alert and shifting. When looking at another animal at a distance, the bear makes an &quot;alert face&quot; as the ears are cocked and alert, the eyes wide open with the mouth is closed or only open slightly. The &quot;tense closed mouth face&quot; is made with the ears laid back and the mouth closed, and occurs when the bear feels threatened. When approached by another individual, the animal makes a &quot;puckered-lip face&quot; with a protruding upper lip and ears that go from cocked and alert when at a certain distance to laid back when closer or when retreating. The &quot;jaw gape face&quot; consists of an open mouth with visible lower canines and hanging lips while the &quot;biting face&quot; is similar to the &quot;relaxed open-mouth face&quot; except the ears are flattened and the eyes are wide enough to expose the sclera. Both the &quot;jaw gape face&quot; and the &quot;biting face&quot; are made when the bear is aggressive and can quickly switch between them.

Brown bears also produce various vocalizations. Huffing occurs when the animal is tense, while woofing is made when alarmed. Both sounds are produced by exhalations, though huffing is harsher and is made continuously (approximately twice per second). Growls and roars are made when aggressive. Growling is &quot;harsh&quot; and &quot;guttural&quot; and can range from a simple &quot;grrr&quot; to a rumble. A rumbling growl can escalate to a roar when the bear is charging. Roaring is described as &quot;thunderous&quot; and can travel . Mothers and cubs wanting physical contact will bawl, which is heard as &quot;waugh!, waugh!&quot;.

===Home ranges===
Brown bears usually inhabit vast home ranges; however, they are not highly territorial. Several adult bears roam freely over the same vicinity without contention, unless rights to a fertile female or food sources are being contested. Despite their lack of traditional territorial behavior, adult males seem to have a &quot;personal zone&quot; within which other bears are not tolerated if they are seen. Males always wander further than females, due to such behavior giving increasing access to both females and food sources. Females have the advantage of inhabiting smaller territories, which decreases the likelihood of encounters with male bears who may endanger their cubs.

In areas where food is abundant, such as coastal Alaska, home ranges for females and males are up to and , respectively. Similarly, in British Columbia, bears of the two sexes travel in relatively compact home ranges of . In Yellowstone National Park, home ranges for females are up to and up to for males. In Romania, the largest home range was recorded for adult males (). In the central Arctic of Canada, where food sources are quite scarce, home ranges range up to for females and for males.

===Reproduction===
The mating season occurs from mid-May to early July, shifting to later in the year the farther north the bears are found. Brown bears are polygynandrous, remaining with the same mate for a couple of days to a couple of weeks and mating multiply during the mating season. Outside of this narrow time frame, adult male and female brown bears show no sexual interest in each other. Females mature sexually between the ages of four and eight. Males first mate about a year later, when they are large and strong enough to compete with other males for mating rights. Males will try to mate with as many females as they can; usually a successful male will mate with two females in a span of one to three weeks. Similarly, adult female brown bears can mate with up to four, sometimes even eight, males while in oestrus (heat), potentially mating with two in a single day. Females come into oestrus every three to four years, with an outside range of 2.4 to 5.7 years. The urine markings of a female in oestrus can attract several males via scent. Dominant males may try to sequester a female for her entire oestrus period of approximately two weeks, but usually are unable to retain her for the entire time. Copulation is prolonged and lasts for over 20 minutes.

Males take no part in raising cubs â parenting is left entirely to the females. Through the process of delayed implantation, a female&#x27;s fertilized egg divides and floats freely in the uterus for six months. During winter dormancy, the fetus attaches to the uterine wall. The cubs are born eight weeks later, while the mother sleeps. If the mother does not gain enough weight to survive through the winter while gestating, the embryo does not implant and is reabsorbed into the body. Litters consist of as many as six cubs, though litters of one to three are more typical. The size of a litter depends on factors such as geographic location and food supply. At birth, cubs are blind, toothless and hairless and may weigh . There are records of females sometimes adopting stray cubs or even trading or kidnapping cubs when they emerge from hibernation (a larger female may claim cubs from a smaller one). Older and larger females within a population tend to give birth to larger litters. The cubs feed on their mother&#x27;s milk until spring or early summer, depending on climate conditions. At this time, the cubs weigh and have developed enough to follow and forage for solid food with their mother over long distances.

The cubs are dependent on the mother and a close bond is formed. During the dependency stage, the cubs learn (rather than inherit as instincts from birth) survival techniques, such as which foods have the highest nutritional value and where to obtain them; how to hunt, fish, and defend themselves; and where to den. Increased brain size in large carnivores has been positively linked to whether a given species is solitary, as is the brown bear, or raises offspring communally. Thus, the relatively large, well-developed brain of a female brown bear is presumably key in teaching behavior. The cubs learn by following and imitating their mother&#x27;s actions during the period they are with her. Cubs remain with their mother for an average of 2.5 years in North America, and gain independence from as early as 1.5 years of age to as late as 4.5 years. The stage at which independence is attained may generally be earlier in some parts of Eurasia, as the latest date which mother and cubs were together was 2.3 years. Most families separated in under two years in a study in Hokkaido, and in Sweden most yearlings were their own. Brown bears practice infanticide, as an adult male bear may kill the cubs of another. When an adult male brown bear kills a cub, it is usually because he is trying to bring the female into oestrus, as she will enter that state within two to four days after the death of her cubs. Cubs may flee up a tree when they see a strange male bear approaching. The mother often successfully defends them, even though the male may be twice as heavy as she. However, females have been known to die in such confrontations.

===Dietary habits===

The brown bear is one of the most omnivorous animals and has been recorded as consuming the greatest variety of foods of any bear. Despite their reputation, most brown bears are not highly carnivorous, as they derive up to 90% of their dietary food energy from vegetable matter. They often feed on a variety of plant life, including berries, grasses, flowers, acorns, and pine cones, as well as fungi such as mushrooms. Among all bears, brown bears are uniquely equipped to dig for tough foods such as roots, bulbs, and shoots. They use their long, strong claws to dig out earth to reach roots and their powerful jaws to bite through them. In spring, winter-provided carrion, grasses, shoots, sedges, moss, and forbs are the dietary mainstays for brown bears internationally. Fruits, including berries, become increasingly important during summer and early autumn. Roots and bulbs become critical in autumn for some inland bear populations if fruit crops are poor.

They will also commonly consume animal matter, which in summer and autumn may regularly be in the form of insects, larvae, and grubs, including beehives. Bears in Yellowstone eat an enormous number of moths during the summer, sometimes as many as 40,000 army cutworm moths in a single day, and may derive up to half of their annual food energy from these insects. Brown bears living near coastal regions will regularly eat crabs and clams. In Alaska, bears along the beaches of estuaries regularly dig through the sand for clams. This species may eat birds and their eggs, including almost entirely ground- or rock-nesting species. The diet may be supplemented by rodents or similar small mammals, including marmots, ground squirrels, mice, rats, lemmings, and voles. With particular regularity, bears in Denali National Park will wait at burrows of Arctic ground squirrels, hoping to pick off a few of those rodents.

In the Kamchatka peninsula and several parts of coastal Alaska, brown bears feed mostly on spawning salmon, whose nutrition and abundance explain the enormous size of the bears in those areas. The fishing techniques of bears are well-documented. They often congregate around falls when the salmon are forced to breach the water, at which point the bears will try to catch the fish in mid-air (often with their mouths). They will also wade into shallow water, hoping to pin a slippery salmon with their claws. While they may eat almost all the parts of the fish, bears at the peak of salmon spawning, when there is usually a glut of fish to feed on, may eat only the most nutrious parts of the salmon (including the eggs and head) and then indifferently leave the rest of the carcass to scavengers, which can include red foxes, bald eagles, common ravens, and gulls. Despite their normally solitary habits, brown bears will gather closely in numbers at good spawning sites. The largest and most powerful males claim the most fruitful fishing spots and will sometimes fight over the rights to them.

Beyond the regular predation of salmon, most brown bears are not particularly active predators. While perhaps a majority of bears of the species will charge at large prey at one point in their lives, many predation attempts start with the bear clumsily and half-heartedly pursuing the prey and end with the prey escaping alive. On the other hand, some brown bears are quite self-assured predators who habitually pursue and catch large prey. Such bears are usually taught how to hunt by their mothers from an early age. Large mammals preyed on can include various ungulate species such as elk, moose, caribou, muskoxen, and wild boar. When brown bears attack these large animals, they usually target young or infirm ones, which are easier to catch. Typically when hunting (especially young prey), the bear pins its prey to the ground and then immediately tears at and eats it alive. It will also bite or swipe some prey to stun it enough to knock it over for consumption. In general, large mammalian prey is killed with raw strength and bears do not display the specialized killing methods of felids and canids. To pick out young or infirm individuals, bears will charge at herds so the more vulnerable, and thus slower-moving, individuals will become apparent. Brown bears may ambush young animals by finding them via scent.

When emerging from hibernation, brown bears, whose broad paws allow them to walk over most ice and snow, may pursue large prey such as moose, whose hooves cannot support them on encrusted snow. Similarly, predatory attacks on large prey sometimes occur at riverbeds, when it is more difficult for the prey specimen to run away due to muddy or slippery soil. On rare occasions, while confronting fully-grown, dangerous prey, bears kill them by hitting with their powerful forearms, which can break the necks and backs of large creatures such as adult moose and adult bison. They feed on carrion, and use their size to intimidate other predators â such as wolves, cougars, tigers, and American black bears â away from their kills. Carrion is especially important in the early spring (when the bears are emerging from hibernation), much of it comprising winter-killed big game. Cannibalism is not unheard of, though predation is not normally believed to be the primary motivation when brown bears attack each other.

When forced to live in close proximity with humans and their domesticated animals, bears may potentially predate any type of domestic animal. Among these, domestic cattle are sometimes exploited as prey. Cattle are bitten on the neck, back, or head, and then the abdominal cavity is opened for eating. Plants and fruit farmed by humans are readily consumed as well, including corn, wheat, sorghum, melons, and any form of berries. They may feed on domestic bee yards, readily consuming both honey and the brood (grubs and pupae) of the honey bee colony. Human foods and trash are eaten when possible. When an open garbage dump was kept in Yellowstone, brown bears were one of the most voracious and regular scavengers. The dump was closed after both brown and American black bears came to associate humans with food and lost their natural fear of them.

===Relations with other predators===
Adult bears are generally immune to predatory attacks except from large Siberian (Amur) tigers and other bears. Following a decrease of ungulate populations from 1944 to 1959, 32 cases of Siberian tigers attacking both Ussuri brown bears (&quot;Ursus arctos lasiotus&quot;) and Ussuri black bears (&quot;U. thibetanus ussuricus&quot;) were recorded in the Russian Far East, and bear hairs were found in several tiger scat samples. Tigers attack black bears less often than brown bears, since the brown bears live in more open habitats and are not able to climb trees. In the same time period, four cases of brown bears killing female tigers and young cubs were reported, both in disputes over prey and in self-defense. In rare cases, when Amur tigers prey on brown bears, they usually target young and sub-adult bears, besides small female adults taken outside their dens, generally when lethargic from hibernation. Predation by tigers on denned brown bears was not detected during a study carried out between 1993 and 2002. Ussuri brown bears, along with the smaller black bears constitute 2.1% of the Siberian tiger&#x27;s annual diet, of which 1.4% are brown bears.

Brown bears regularly intimidate wolves to drive them away from their kills. In Yellowstone National Park, bears pirate wolf kills so often, Yellowstone&#x27;s Wolf Project director Doug Smith wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s not a matter of if the bears will come calling after a kill, but when.&quot; Despite the animosity between the two species, most confrontations at kill sites or large carcasses end without bloodshed on either side. Though conflict over carcasses is common, on rare occasions the two predators tolerate each other at the same kill. To date, there is a single recorded case of fully-grown wolves being killed by a grizzly bear. Given the opportunity, however, both species will prey on the other&#x27;s cubs. In some areas, grizzly bears regularly displace cougars from their kills. Cougars kill small bear cubs on rare occasions, but there was only one report of a bear killing a cougar, of unknown age and condition, between 1993 and 1996. 

Brown bears usually dominate other bear species in areas where they coexist. Due to their smaller size, American black bears are at a competitive disadvantage to grizzly bears in open, unforested areas. Although displacement of black bears by grizzly bears has been documented, actual killing of black bears by grizzlies has only occasionally been reported. Confrontation is mostly avoided due to the black bear&#x27;s diurnal habits and preference for heavily forested areas, as opposed to the grizzly&#x27;s largely nocturnal habits and preference for open spaces. Brown bears may also kill Asian black bears, though the latter species probably largely avoids conflicts with the brown bear, due to similar habits and habitat preferences to the American black species. As of the 21st century, there has been an increase in interactions between brown bears and polar bears, theorized to be caused by climate change. Brown and grizzly bears have been seen moving increasingly northward into territories formerly claimed by polar bears. They tend to dominate polar bears in disputes over carcasses, and dead polar bear cubs have been found in brown bear dens.

===Longevity and mortality===
The brown bear has a naturally long life. Wild females have been observed reproducing at 28 years, which is the oldest known age for reproduction of any ursid in the wild. The peak reproductive age for females ranges from four to 20 years old. The lifespan of both sexes within minimally hunted populations is estimated at an average of 25 years. The oldest recorded wild individual was nearly 37 years old. In captivity, the oldest recorded female was around 40 years old, while males have been known to live up to 47 years.

While male bears potentially live longer in captivity, female grizzly bears have a greater annual survival rate than males within wild populations, per a study done in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Annual mortality for bears of any age is estimated at 10% in most protected areas. Around 13% to 44% of cubs die within their first year. Beyond predation by large predators â including wolves, Siberian tigers, and other brown bears â starvation and accidents also claim the lives of cubs. Studies have indicated that the most prevalent cause of mortality for first-year cubs is malnutrition.

Brown bears are susceptible to parasites such as flukes, ticks, tapeworms, roundworms, and biting lice. It is thought that brown bears may catch canine distemper virus (CDV) from other caniforms such as stray dogs and wolves. A captive individual allegedly succumbed to Aujeszky&#x27;s disease.

=== Hibernation physiology ===
A study conducted by the Brown Bear Research Project did a proteomic analysis of the brown bear&#x27;s blood, organs, and tissues to pinpoint proteins and peptides that either increased or decreased in expression in the winter and summer months. One major finding was that the presence of the plasma protein sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) increased by 45 times during the brown bear&#x27;s hibernation period. Although scientists do not yet understand the role of SHBG in maintaining the brown bear&#x27;s health, some believe these findings could potentially help in understanding and preventing human diseases that come from a sedentary lifestyle.

==Relations with humans==

===Attacks on humans===

Brown bears usually avoid areas where extensive development or urbanization has occurred. They usually avoid people and rarely attack on sight. They are, however, unpredictable in temperament, and may attack if threatened or surprised. Mothers defending cubs are the most prone to attacking, being responsible for 70% of brown bear-caused human fatalities in North America. Attacks tend to result in serious injury and, in some cases, death. Due to the bears&#x27; enormous physical strength, a single bite or swipe can be deadly. Violent encounters with brown bears usually last a few minutes, though they can be prolonged if the victims fight back.

A study conducted in 2019 found that 664 bear attacks were reported during a 15-year period (20002015) throughout North America and Eurasia. There were 568 injuries and 95 fatalities. Around 10 people a year are killed by brown bears in Russia, more than all the other parts of the brown bear&#x27;s range combined. In Japan, a large brown bear nicknamed &quot;Kesagake&quot; (&quot;kesa-style slasher&quot;) caused the worst brown bear attack in Japanese history in Tomamae, HokkaidÅ, during numerous encounters during December 1915. It killed seven people and wounded three others before being gunned down during a large-scale beast-hunt. A study by U.S. and Canadian researchers has found bear spray to be more effective at stopping aggressive bear behavior than guns, working in 92% of studied incidents, versus 67% for guns.

=== Bear hunting ===

Humans have been recorded hunting brown bears for over 10,300â9,300 years. Bears were hunted throughout their range in Europe, Asia and North America by both the Native Americans and Europeans. The former usually killed bears for survival needs, while the latter for sports or population control. In Europe, between the 17th and 18th centuries, humans sought to control brown bear numbers by awarding those who managed to kill one. This bounty scheme pushed the brown bear population to the brink of extinction before comprehensive protection was offered in the 1900s. Despite this, a 2018 study found hunting to be one of the contributing factors to the drop in brown bear numbers in northern Europe.

The earliest known case of a European killing a grizzly bear dates back to 1691. Their arrival in western United States led to the extirpation of local brown bear populations in the 19th and early 20th centuries. During the early years of European settlement in North America, bears were usually killed with a spear or lasso rope. The introduction of rifles in the mid-19th century largely facilitated bear hunts, which allowed for an increasing trend. Bears were also pitted into fights against male cattle, often ending with either animal grievously injured or dead. The last two decades of the 19th century saw an increase in bounties. Conflicts with farmers also contributed to its rapid decline. It wasn&#x27;t until the 1920s that grizzly bears received some type of protection from the US government. Today, brown bears are legally hunted in some American states, such as Alaska. However, a hunting license is required and killings of nurturing females and cubs will result in a prison sentence.

Brown bear meat is sometimes consumed and used in recipes such as dumplings, hams and stews. The Indigenous people of James Bay (Eastern) Cree use their flesh in traditional dishes. In Asia and Romania, the paws are consumed as exotic delectables; they have been a prevalent component of traditional Chinese food since 500 BC. The total weight of commercially sold brown bear meat is estimated at 17 tons annually.

=== In captivity ===
Bears have been recorded in captivity as early as 1,500 BC. As of 2017, there are more than 700 brown bears in zoos and wildlife parks worldwide. Captive bears are largely lethargic and spend a considerable amount of time doing nothing. When active, captive bears may engage in repetitive back and forth motion, known widely as pacing. This behavior is most prevalent in bears kept in small, cramped cages often with no natural setting. Pacing is a way of coping with stress that comes with being trapped in unnaturally small spaces. These stereotyped behaviors have decreased due to better and larger enclosures being built, and more sustainable management from zoo staff.

Starting from infancy, brown bears may also be exploited as dancing bears. Cubs, for example, are positioned on hot metal plates, causing them to &quot;dance&quot; to the sound of violin music running in the background. The process is repeated, resulting in bears being trained to &quot;dance&quot; when a violin is played. Similarly, brown bears are displayed in tiny enclosures near a restaurant, mainly for the purpose of luring customers. Privately owned bears are also placed in insufficient environments and often suffer from malnutrition and obesity. 

Brown bears have been popular attractions at circuses and other acts since ancient times. Due to their large size and imposing demeanor, the Romans used brown bears in the execution of criminals, and pitted bears in fights with other animals. Gladiators would also fight bears, in what was essentially a fight to the death. Such events occurred in amphitheaters housing thousands of spectators. In later times, street performances became popular in the Middle Ages; acts included &quot;dancing&quot; and &quot;sleeping on command&quot;. These performances became increasingly widespread, and from the 1700s to 1800s, traveling circuses would perform in the streets of many European and Asian countries. Such circuses made use of bears that wore special clothing, and were usually run by musicians. A short while later, modern circuses began utilizing bears around the second half of the 18th century. Brown bears were said to be the easiest bear species to train due to their intelligence, unique personalities, and exceptional stability. According to a 2009 analysis, the brown bear was the second most exploited circus animal after the tiger.

===Culture===

Bears have been popular subjects in art, literature, folklore, and mythology. The image of the mother bear was prevalent throughout societies in North America and Eurasia, based on the female&#x27;s devotion and protection of her cubs. The earliest cave paintings of bears occurred in the Paleolithic, with over 100 recorded paintings. Brown bears often figure in the literature of Europe and North America as &quot;cute and cuddly&quot;, in particular that which is written for children. &quot;The Brown Bear of Norway&quot; is a Scottish fairy tale telling of the adventures of a girl who married a prince magically turned into a bear and who managed to get him back into a human form by the force of her love after many trials and tribulations. With &quot;Goldilocks and the Three Bears&quot;, a story from England, the Three Bears are usually depicted as brown bears. In German-speaking countries, children are often told the fairytale of &quot;Snow White and Rose Red&quot;; the handsome prince in this tale has been transfigured into a brown bear. In the United States, parents often read their preschool age children the book &quot;Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?&quot; to teach them their colors and how they are associated with different animals. Smokey Bear, the famous mascot of U.S. Forest Service, has since the 1940s been used to educate people on the dangers of human-caused wildfire.

Brown bears have been extensively featured in the culture of Native Americans, and are considered sacred. To stop a bear&#x27;s spirit from escaping after it was killed, the Denaa people severed all 4 of its paws. They delayed consuming brown-bear flesh, owing to the belief that the bear&#x27;s spirit was overwhelming in fresh kills. In addition, community members that wore bear claw necklaces were highly respected, as wearing one was seen as a sign of bravery and honor. The clattering caused by repeatedly shaking these necklaces were believed to bring forth therapeutic powers. In Haida culture, one legend has it that a marriage between a woman and a grizzly bear commenced the lineage of the native people. This is thought to have allowed the Haida to thrive in bear country.

There is evidence of prehistoric bear worship, though this is disputed by archaeologists. It is possible that bear worship existed in early Chinese and Ainu cultures. The Romans built small carved figures of bears that were used during the burials of infants. In Ancient Greek mythology, bears were considered similar to humans, mainly due to their ability to stand upright. In many western stories and older fables the portrayed attributes of bears are sluggishness, foolishness, and gullibility, which contradicts the actual behavior of the species. For example, bears have been reported tricking hunters by backtracking in the snow. 

In North America, the brown bear is considered a charismatic megafauna and has long piqued people&#x27;s interest. The death of Bear 148 at the hands of a trophy hunter in 2017 sparked media outrage and the continued disapproval of trophy hunting. The Russian bear is a common national personification for Russia (as well as the former Soviet Union), despite the country having no officially-designated national animal. The brown bear is Finland&#x27;s national animal. The grizzly bear is the state animal of Montana. The California golden bear is the state animal of California, despite being extinct. The coat of arms of Madrid depicts a bear reaching up into a madroÃ±o or strawberry tree (&quot;Arbutus unedo&quot;) to eat some of its fruit. The Swiss city of Bern&#x27;s coat of arms depicts a bear and the city&#x27;s name is popularly thought to derive from the German word for bear. The brown bear is depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 5-kuna coin, minted since 1993.

<text>In physics, the BardeenâCooperâSchrieffer (BCS) theory (named after John Bardeen, Leon Cooper, and John Robert Schrieffer) is the first microscopic theory of superconductivity since Heike Kamerlingh Onnes&#x27;s 1911 discovery. The theory describes superconductivity as a microscopic effect caused by a condensation of Cooper pairs. The theory is also used in nuclear physics to describe the pairing interaction between nucleons in an atomic nucleus.

It was proposed by Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer in 1957; they received the Nobel Prize in Physics for this theory in 1972. 

==History==
Rapid progress in the understanding of superconductivity gained momentum in the mid-1950s. It began with the 1948 paper, &quot;On the Problem of the Molecular Theory of Superconductivity&quot;, where Fritz London proposed that the phenomenological London equations may be consequences of the coherence of a quantum state. In 1953, Brian Pippard, motivated by penetration experiments, proposed that this would modify the London equations via a new scale parameter called the coherence length. John Bardeen then argued in the 1955 paper, &quot;Theory of the Meissner Effect in Superconductors&quot;, that such a modification naturally occurs in a theory with an energy gap. The key ingredient was Leon Cooper&#x27;s calculation of the bound states of electrons subject to an attractive force in his 1956 paper, &quot;Bound Electron Pairs in a Degenerate Fermi Gas&quot;.

In 1957 Bardeen and Cooper assembled these ingredients and constructed such a theory, the BCS theory, with Robert Schrieffer. The theory was first published in April 1957 in the letter, &quot;Microscopic theory of superconductivity&quot;. The demonstration that the phase transition is second order, that it reproduces the Meissner effect and the calculations of specific heats and penetration depths appeared in the December 1957 article, &quot;Theory of superconductivity&quot;. They received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1972 for this theory.

In 1986, high-temperature superconductivity was discovered in La-Ba-Cu-O, at temperatures up to 30Â K. Following experiments determined more materials with transition temperatures up to about 130Â K, considerably above the previous limit of about 30Â K. It is experimentally very well known that the transition temperature strongly depends on pressure. In general, it is believed that BCS theory alone cannot explain this phenomenon and that other effects are in play. These effects are still not yet fully understood; it is possible that they even control superconductivity at low temperatures for some materials.

==Overview==
At sufficiently low temperatures, electrons near the Fermi surface become unstable against the formation of Cooper pairs. Cooper showed such binding will occur in the presence of an attractive potential, no matter how weak. In conventional superconductors, an attraction is generally attributed to an electron-lattice interaction. The BCS theory, however, requires only that the potential be attractive, regardless of its origin. In the BCS framework, superconductivity is a macroscopic effect which results from the condensation of Cooper pairs. These have some bosonic properties, and bosons, at sufficiently low temperature, can form a large BoseâEinstein condensate. Superconductivity was simultaneously explained by Nikolay Bogolyubov, by means of the Bogoliubov transformations.

In many superconductors, the attractive interaction between electrons (necessary for pairing) is brought about indirectly by the interaction between the electrons and the vibrating crystal lattice (the phonons). Roughly speaking the picture is the following:

An electron moving through a conductor will attract nearby positive charges in the lattice. This deformation of the lattice causes another electron, with opposite spin, to move into the region of higher positive charge density. The two electrons then become correlated. Because there are a lot of such electron pairs in a superconductor, these pairs overlap very strongly and form a highly collective condensate. In this &quot;condensed&quot; state, the breaking of one pair will change the energy of the entire condensate - not just a single electron, or a single pair. Thus, the energy required to break any single pair is related to the energy required to break &quot;all&quot; of the pairs (or more than just two electrons). Because the pairing increases this energy barrier, kicks from oscillating atoms in the conductor (which are small at sufficiently low temperatures) are not enough to affect the condensate as a whole, or any individual &quot;member pair&quot; within the condensate. Thus the electrons stay paired together and resist all kicks, and the electron flow as a whole (the current through the superconductor) will not experience resistance. Thus, the collective behavior of the condensate is a crucial ingredient necessary for superconductivity.

===Details===
BCS theory starts from the assumption that there is some attraction between electrons, which can overcome the Coulomb repulsion. In most materials (in low temperature superconductors), this attraction is brought about indirectly by the coupling of electrons to the crystal lattice (as explained above). However, the results of BCS theory do &quot;not&quot; depend on the origin of the attractive interaction. For instance, Cooper pairs have been observed in ultracold gases of fermions where a homogeneous magnetic field has been tuned to their Feshbach resonance. The original results of BCS (discussed below) described an s-wave superconducting state, which is the rule among low-temperature superconductors but is not realized in many unconventional superconductors such as the d-wave high-temperature superconductors.

Extensions of BCS theory exist to describe these other cases, although they are insufficient to completely describe the observed features of high-temperature superconductivity.

BCS is able to give an approximation for the quantum-mechanical many-body state of the system of (attractively interacting) electrons inside the metal. This state is now known as the BCS state. In the normal state of a metal, electrons move independently, whereas in the BCS state, they are bound into Cooper pairs by the attractive interaction. The BCS formalism is based on the reduced potential for the electrons&#x27; attraction. Within this potential, a variational ansatz for the wave function is proposed. This ansatz was later shown to be exact in the dense limit of pairs. Note that the continuous crossover between the dilute and dense regimes of attracting pairs of fermions is still an open problem, which now attracts a lot of attention within the field of ultracold gases.

===Underlying evidence===
The hyperphysics website pages at Georgia State University summarize some key background to BCS theory as follows:

* Evidence of a band gap at the Fermi level (described as &quot;a key piece in the puzzle&quot;)
: the existence of a critical temperature and critical magnetic field implied a band gap, and suggested a phase transition, but single electrons are forbidden from condensing to the same energy level by the Pauli exclusion principle. The site comments that &quot;a drastic change in conductivity demanded a drastic change in electron behavior&quot;. Conceivably, pairs of electrons might perhaps act like bosons instead, which are bound by different condensate rules and do not have the same limitation. 
*Isotope effect on the critical temperature, suggesting lattice interactions
: The Debye frequency of phonons in a lattice is proportional to the inverse of the square root of the mass of lattice ions. It was shown that the superconducting transition temperature of mercury indeed showed the same dependence, by substituting the most abundant natural mercury isotope, 202Hg, with a different isotope, 198Hg.
* An exponential rise in heat capacity near the critical temperature for some superconductors
: An exponential increase in heat capacity near the critical temperature also suggests an energy bandgap for the superconducting material. As superconducting vanadium is warmed toward its critical temperature, its heat capacity increases greatly in a very few degrees; this suggests an energy gap being bridged by thermal energy.
* The lessening of the measured energy gap towards the critical temperature
: This suggests a type of situation where some kind of binding energy exists but it is gradually weakened as the temperature increases toward the critical temperature. A binding energy suggests two or more particles or other entities that are bound together in the superconducting state. This helped to support the idea of bound particles â specifically electron pairs â and together with the above helped to paint a general picture of paired electrons and their lattice interactions.

==Implications==
BCS derived several important theoretical predictions that are independent of the details of the interaction, since the quantitative predictions mentioned below hold for any sufficiently weak attraction between the electrons and this last condition is fulfilled for many low temperature superconductors - the so-called weak-coupling case. These have been confirmed in numerous experiments:
* The electrons are bound into Cooper pairs, and these pairs are correlated due to the Pauli exclusion principle for the electrons, from which they are constructed. Therefore, in order to break a pair, one has to change energies of all other pairs. This means there is an energy gap for single-particle excitation, unlike in the normal metal (where the state of an electron can be changed by adding an arbitrarily small amount of energy). This energy gap is highest at low temperatures but vanishes at the transition temperature when superconductivity ceases to exist. The BCS theory gives an expression that shows how the gap grows with the strength of the attractive interaction and the (normal phase) single particle density of states at the Fermi level. Furthermore, it describes how the density of states is changed on entering the superconducting state, where there are no electronic states any more at the Fermi level. The energy gap is most directly observed in tunneling experiments and in reflection of microwaves from superconductors.
* BCS theory predicts the dependence of the value of the energy gap Î at temperature &quot;T&quot; on the critical temperature &quot;T&quot;c. The ratio between the value of the energy gap at zero temperature and the value of the superconducting transition temperature (expressed in energy units) takes the universal value formula_1 independent of material. Near the critical temperature the relation asymptotes to formula_2 which is of the form suggested the previous year by M. J. Buckingham based on the fact that the superconducting phase transition is second order, that the superconducting phase has a mass gap and on Blevins, Gordy and Fairbank&#x27;s experimental results the previous year on the absorption of millimeter waves by superconducting tin.
* Due to the energy gap, the specific heat of the superconductor is suppressed strongly (exponentially) at low temperatures, there being no thermal excitations left. However, before reaching the transition temperature, the specific heat of the superconductor becomes even higher than that of the normal conductor (measured immediately above the transition) and the ratio of these two values is found to be universally given by 2.5.
* BCS theory correctly predicts the Meissner effect, i.e. the expulsion of a magnetic field from the superconductor and the variation of the penetration depth (the extent of the screening currents flowing below the metal&#x27;s surface) with temperature. 
* It also describes the variation of the critical magnetic field (above which the superconductor can no longer expel the field but becomes normal conducting) with temperature. BCS theory relates the value of the critical field at zero temperature to the value of the transition temperature and the density of states at the Fermi level.
* In its simplest form, BCS gives the superconducting transition temperature &quot;T&quot;c in terms of the electron-phonon coupling potential &quot;V&quot; and the Debye cutoff energy &quot;E&quot;D: formula_3 where &quot;N&quot;(0) is the electronic density of states at the Fermi level. For more details, see Cooper pairs.
* The BCS theory reproduces the isotope effect, which is the experimental observation that for a given superconducting material, the critical temperature is inversely proportional to the square-root of the mass of the isotope used in the material. The isotope effect was reported by two groups on 24 March 1950, who discovered it independently working with different mercury isotopes, although a few days before publication they learned of each other&#x27;s results at the ONR conference in Atlanta. The two groups are Emanuel Maxwell, and C. A. Reynolds, B. Serin, W. H. Wright, and L. B. Nesbitt. The choice of isotope ordinarily has little effect on the electrical properties of a material, but does affect the frequency of lattice vibrations. This effect suggests that superconductivity is related to vibrations of the lattice. This is incorporated into BCS theory, where lattice vibrations yield the binding energy of electrons in a Cooper pair.

<text>The biathlon is a winter sport that combines cross-country skiing and rifle shooting. It is treated as a race, with contestants skiing through a cross-country trail whose distance is divided into shooting rounds. The shooting rounds are not timed per se, but depending on the competition, missed shots result in extra distance or time being added to the contestant&#x27;s total.

==History==

According to &quot;EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica&quot;, the biathlon &quot;is rooted in the skiing traditions of Scandinavia, where early inhabitants revered the Norse god Ullr as both the ski god and the hunting god.&quot; In modern times, the activity that developed into this sport was an exercise for Norwegians as alternative training for the military. Norwegian skiing regiments organized military skiing contests in the 18th century, divided into four classes: shooting at mark while skiing at top speed, downhill race among trees, downhill race on big hills without falling, and a long race on flat ground while carrying a rifle and military pack. In modern terminology, these military contests included downhill, slalom, biathlon, and cross-country skiing. One of the world&#x27;s first known ski clubs, &quot;Trysil Skytte- og SkilÃ¸berforening&quot; (the Trysil Rifle and Ski Club), was formed in Norway in 1861 to promote national defense at the local level. 20th century variants include (the military contest), a 17Â km cross-country race with shooting, and the military cross-country race at 30Â km including marksmanship. 

The modern biathlon is a civilian variant of the old military combined exercise. In Norway, the biathlon was until 1984 a branch of , an organization set up by the government to promote civilian marksmanship in support of national defence. In Norwegian, the biathlon is called (literally &quot;ski shooting&quot;). In Norway, there are still separate contests in , a cross-country race at 12Â km with large-caliber rifle shooting at various targets with unknown range.

Called military patrol, the combination of skiing and shooting was contested at the Winter Olympic Games in 1924 and then demonstrated in 1928, 1936, and 1948, during which time Norway and Finland were strong competitors. In 1948, the sport was reorganized under the Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne et Biathlon and became re-accepted as an Olympic sport in 1955, with widespread popularity within the Soviet and Swedish winter sport circuits.

The first Biathlon World Championship was held in 1958 in Austria, and in 1960 the sport was finally included in the Olympic Games. At Albertville in 1992, women were first allowed in the Olympic biathlon. The pursuit format was added for the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics, and the IBU added mixed relay as a format for the 2006 Olympics.

The competitions from 1958 to 1965 used high-power centrefire cartridges, such as the .30-06 Springfield and the 7.62Ã51mm NATO, before the .22 Long Rifle rimfire cartridge was standardized in 1978. The ammunition was carried in a belt worn around the competitor&#x27;s waist. The sole event was the men&#x27;s 20Â km individual, encompassing four separate ranges and firing distances of 100Â m, 150Â m, 200Â m, and 250Â m. The target distance was reduced to 150Â m with the addition of the relay in 1966. The shooting range was further reduced to 50Â m in 1978 with the mechanical self-indicating targets making their debut at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid. For the 2018â2019 season, fully electronic targets were approved as an alternative to paper or mechanical steel targets for IBU events.

==Governing body==
In 1948, the International Modern Pentathlon Union (UIPM) was founded to standardize the rules for the modern pentathlon and from 1953 also biathlon. In July 1993, the biathlon branch of the UIPMB created the International Biathlon Union (IBU), which officially separated from the UIPMB in 1998.

Presidents of the UIPMB/IBU:
* 1947â1949: Tom Wiborn (Sweden)
* 1949â1960: Gustaf Dyrssen (Sweden)
* 1960â1988: Sven Thofelt (Sweden)
* 1988â1992: Igor Novikov (USSR/Russia)
* 1992â2018: Anders Besseberg (Norway)
* SinceÂ 2018: (Sweden)

==Championships==

The following articles list major international biathlon events and medalists. Unlike the Olympics and World Championships (BWCH), the World Cup (BWC) is an entire winter season of (mostly) weekly races, where the medalists are those with the highest sums of World Cup points at the end of the season.
* Biathlon at the Winter Olympics
* Biathlon World Championships
* Biathlon World Cup
* Biathlon European Championships
* IBU Cup
* Biathlon Junior World Championships
* Biathlon at the Winter Universiade

==Rules and equipment==

The complete rules of the biathlon are given in the official IBU rule books.

===Basic concepts===
A biathlon competition consists of a race in which contestants ski through a cross-country trail system whose total distance is divided into either two or four shooting rounds, half in the prone position, the other half standing. Depending on the shooting performance, extra distance or time is added to the contestant&#x27;s total skiing distance/time. The contestant with the shortest total time wins.

For each shooting round, the biathlete must hit five targets or receive a penalty for each missed target, which varies according to the competition rules as follows:

* Skiing around a penalty loopâtypically taking 20â30 seconds for elite biathletes to complete, depending on weather and snow conditions.
* Adding one minute to the skier&#x27;s total time.
* Use of an extra cartridge (placed at the shooting range) to hit the target; only three such extras are available for each round, and a penalty loop must be done for each target left standing.

In order to keep track of the contestants&#x27; progress and relative standing throughout a race, split times (intermediate times) are taken at several points along the skiing track and upon finishing each shooting round. The large display screens commonly set up at biathlon arenas, as well as the information graphics shown as part of the TV picture, will typically list the split time of the fastest contestant at each intermediate point and the times and time differences to the closest runners-up.

===Skiing details===
In the Olympics, all cross-country skiing techniques are permitted in the biathlon, allowing the use of skate skiing, which is overwhelmingly the choice of competitors. The minimum ski length is the height of the skier minus 4Â cm. The rifle has to be carried by the skier during the race at all times.

===Shooting details===
The biathlete carries a small-bore rifle, which must weigh at least , excluding ammunition and magazines. The rifles use .22 LR ammunition and are bolt action or Fortner (straight-pull bolt) action. Each rifle holds 4 magazines with 5 rounds each. Additional rounds can be kept on the stock of the rifle for a relay race.

The target range shooting distance is . There are five circular shooting targets to be hit in each shooting round. When shooting in the prone position, the target diameter is ; when shooting in the standing position, the target diameter is . This translates to angular target sizes of 0.9 and 2.3 mrad respectively. On all modern biathlon ranges, the targets are self-indicating, in that they flip from black to white when hit, giving the biathlete, as well as the spectators, instant visual feedback for each shot fired.

Ear protection is not required during biathlon shooting as the ammunition used is usually subsonic. An eyecup (blinder) is an optional feature of biathlon rifles.

==Competition format==

===Individual===
The individual race [ for women] is the oldest biathlon event; the distance is skied over five laps. The biathlete shoots four times at any shooting lane (lanes 1â15 are in prone, while lanes 16â30 are for standing), in the order of prone, standing, prone, standing, totaling 20 targets. For each missed target, a fixed penalty time, usually one minute, is added to the skiing time of the biathlete. Competitors&#x27; starts are staggered, normally by 30 seconds.

A variation of the standard individual race, called short individual, was introduced during the 2018â19 Biathlon IBU Cup. The races are 15Â km for men and 12.5Â km for women, and for each missed target, 45 seconds will be added to the skiing time.

===Sprint===
The sprint is for men &amp; for women; the distance is skied over three laps. The biathlete shoots twice at any shooting lane, once prone (usually lanes 1â15) and once standing (lanes 16â30), for a total of 10 shots. For each miss, a penalty loop of 150Â m must be skied before continuing the race. As in the individual competition, the biathletes start in intervals.

=== Super Sprint ===
Introduced at the 2017â18 Biathlon IBU Cup, the Super Sprint is a shorter version of the sprint race. Unlike the traditional sprint race, the Super Sprint is divided into two segments â qualification and final. The qualification is done like the traditional sprint, but on a 1.5Â km lap with a total length of 4.5Â km. Only the top 30 competitors qualify for the final, in which all competitors start simultaneously and do five laps on the same course (like in mass start) with a total race length of 4Â km. During the final, the competitors have three spare rounds should they miss a target (like in relay race). However, if not all targets are cleared during shooting instead of going on the penalty loop, the biathlete is disqualified from the race.

Changes were made for the following season with the course now being 1Â km (0.2Â km increase) meaning that the qualification race length will become 3Â km, while the final race becomes 5Â km in length. Also the number of spare rounds was decreased from three to one.

===Pursuit===

In a pursuit, biathletes&#x27; starts are separated by their time differences from a previous race, most commonly a sprint. The contestant crossing the finish line first is the winner. The distance is 12.5Â km for men and 10Â km for women, skied over five laps; there are four shooting bouts (two prone, two standing, in that order) and each miss means a penalty loop of 150Â m. To prevent awkward or dangerous crowding of the skiing loops and overcapacity at the shooting range, World Cup Pursuits are held with only the 60 top-ranking biathletes after the preceding race. The biathletes shoot on a first-come, first-served basis at the lane corresponding to the position they arrived for all shooting bouts. If the pursuit follows an individual biathlon race, the lag behind the winner is halved.

===Mass start===
In the mass start, all biathletes start at the same time, and the first across the finish line wins. In this 15Â km for men or 12.5Â km for women competition, the distance is skied over five laps; there are four bouts of shooting (two prone, two standing, in that order), with the first shooting bout being at the lane corresponding to the competitor&#x27;s bib number (bib #10 shoots at lane #10 regardless of position in race), with the rest of the shooting bouts being on a first-come, first-served basis (if a competitor arrives at the lane in fifth place, they shoot at lane 5). As in sprint and pursuit, competitors must ski one 150Â m penalty loop for each miss. Here again, to avoid unwanted congestion, World Cup Mass starts are held with only the 30 top ranking athletes on the start line (half that of the Pursuit as here all contestants start simultaneously).

===Mass start 60===
Starting in the 2018/2019 season, the Mass Start 60 became part of the International Biathlon Union (IBU) competition formats. The Mass Start with 60 starters does not replace the current Mass Start with 30 starters.

Everyone skis the first lap together, but only the first 30 stop to shoot, and the second 30 keep skiing. At the end of the second lap, the second 30 stop to shoot, and the first 30 continue to ski. After the first two shoots are over (everyone&#x27;s first prone), the race continues like a typical race, and all competitors shoot remaining prone, and two stands together. Or more simply:

Bib 1â30 = lap, shoot1, lap, lap, shoot2, lap, shoot3, lap, shoot4, lap

Bib 31â60 = lap, lap, shoot1, lap, shoot2, lap, shoot3, lap, shoot4, lap

===Relay===
The relay teams consist of four biathletes, who each ski 7.5Â km (men) or 6Â km (women), each leg skied over three laps, with two shooting rounds; one prone, one standing. For every round of five targets, there are eight bullets available. However, the last three can only be single-loaded manually one at a time from spare round holders or bullets deposited by the competitor into trays or onto the mat at the firing line. If there are still standing targets after eight bullets, one 150Â m (490Â ft) penalty loop must be taken for each missed target remaining. The first-leg participants all start simultaneously, and as in cross-country skiing relays, every athlete of a team must touch the team&#x27;s next-leg participant to perform a valid changeover. On the first shooting stage of the first leg, the participant must shoot in the lane corresponding to their bib number (bib #10 shoots at lane #10 regardless of their position in the race), then for the remainder of the relay, the relay team shoots on a first-come, first-served basis (arrive at the range in fifth place, shoot at lane 5).

===Mixed relay===
The mixed relay is similar to the ordinary relay, but the teams are composed of two women and two men. From its first instance at the world championships in 2005 until the end of the 2017 season, the first two legs were always run by the women, followed by the men on legs 3 and 4. Since the 2018 season however, the race can be started by either the men or women . Additionally, for most of the event&#x27;s history, the women&#x27;s legs have been and the men&#x27;s legs as in ordinary relay competitions. However, since the 2019 season the event has all four legs being either or .
This event was added to the Olympics starting in 2014.

===Single mixed relay===
In 2015, the single mixed relay was introduced to the Biathlon World Cup by the IBU. The event is run on a track with a penalty loop, and each team consists of a female and a male runner. The race is divided into four legs, with the first three being or 2 laps and the final leg being or 3 laps, totalling . After each leg, the runners exchange so that each runner completes two legs. Specific to this format, the exchange happens immediately after the last shooting of each leg without skiing an additional lap (as is usually the case). The race can be started by either the female or male member of the relay, with the finishing member performing an extra lap. This event was added to the world championships in 2019.

===Team (obsolete)===
A team consists of four biathletes, but unlike the relay competition, all team members start at the same time. Two athletes must shoot in the prone shooting round, the other two in the standing round. In case of a miss, the two non-shooting biathletes must ski a penalty loop of 150Â m (490Â ft). The skiers must enter the shooting area together and must also finish within 15 seconds of each other; otherwise, a time penalty of one minute is added to the total time. Since 2004, this race format has been obsolete at the World Cup level.

==Broadcasting==
Biathlon events are broadcast most regularly where the sport enjoys its greatest popularity, namely Germany (ARD, ZDF), Austria (ORF), Norway (NRK), France (L&#x27;Ãquipe 21), Finland (YLE), Estonia (ETV), Latvia (LTV), Lithuania (LRT), Croatia (HRT), Poland (Polsat), Ukraine (), Sweden (SVT), Russia (Match TV, Channel One), Belarus (TVR), Slovakia (RTVS), Slovenia (RTV), Bosnia and Herzegovina (BHRT), Bulgaria (BNT), and South Korea (KBS); it is broadcast on European-wide Eurosport, which also broadcasts to the Asia-Pacific region. World Cup races are streamed via the IBU website.

<text>Bubble and squeak is an English dish made from cooked potatoes and cabbage, mixed together and fried. The food writer Howard Hillman classes it as one of the &quot;great peasant dishes of the world&quot;. The dish has been known since at least the 18th century, and in its early versions it contained cooked beef; by the mid-20th century the two vegetables had become the principal ingredients.

==History==
The name of the dish, according to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (OED), alludes to the sounds made by the ingredients when being fried. The first recorded use of the name listed in the OED dates from 1762; &quot;The St James&#x27;s Chronicle&quot;, recording the dishes served at a banquet, included &quot;Bubble and Squeak, garnish&#x27;d with Eddowes Cow Bumbo, and Tongue&quot;. A correspondent in &quot;The Public Advertiser&quot; two years later reported making &quot;a very hearty Meal on fried Beef and Cabbage; though I could not have touched it had my Wife recommended it to me under the fashionable Appellation of &quot;Bubble and Squeak&quot;&quot;. In 1791 another London paper recorded the quarterly meeting of the Bubble and Squeak Society at Smithfield.
The dish as it is made in modern times differs considerably from its first recorded versions, in which cooked beef was the main ingredient and potatoes did not feature. The earliest-known recipe is in Maria Rundell&#x27;s &quot;A New System of Domestic Cookery&quot;, published in 1806. It consists wholly of cabbage and rare roast beef, seasoned and fried. This method is followed by William Kitchiner in his book &quot;Apicius Redivivus, or The Cook&#x27;s Oracle&quot; (1817); in later editions he adds a couplet at the top of his recipe:
&lt;poem&gt;
 When &#x27;midst the frying Pan in accents savage,
 The Beef, so surly, quarrels with the Cabbage. &lt;/poem&gt;
Mrs Beeton&#x27;s recipe in her &quot;Book of Household Management&quot; (1861) similarly combines cooked beef with cabbage (and, in her recipe, onions) but no potato. An 1848 recipe from the US is similar, but adds chopped carrots. In all of these, the meat and vegetables are served next to each other, and not mixed together.

In 1872, a Lancashire newspaper offered a recipe for &quot;delicious bubble and squeak&quot;, consisting of thinly-sliced beef fried with cabbage and carrot, but not potatoes, although by then they had been a major crop in Lancashire for decades. In the 1880s potatoes began to appear in recipes. In 1882 the &quot;Household&quot; column of &quot;The Manchester Times&quot; suggested:
Potatoes featured in a recipe printed in a Yorkshire paper in 1892 but, as in earlier versions, the main ingredients were beef and cabbage.

==Modern versions==

Possibly because of the scarcity of beef during food rationing in and after the Second World War, by the latter half of the 20th century the basic ingredients were widely considered to be cooked and mashed (or coarsely crushed) potato and chopped cooked cabbage. Those are the only two ingredients in Delia Smith&#x27;s 1987 recipe. Clarissa Dickson Wright&#x27;s 1996 version consists of crushed cooked potatoes, finely chopped raw onion, and cooked cabbage (or brussels sprouts), seasoned with salt and pepper, mixed together and shallow-fried until browned on the exterior. Like Smith, Dickson Wright specifies dripping (or lard) for frying, finding vegetable oil unsuitable for frying bubble and squeak, because the mixture will not brown adequately. Several other cooks find oil or butter satisfactory.

Fiona Beckett (2008), like Smith and Dickson Wright, stipulates no ingredients other than potato and cabbage,
but there are many published variants of the basic recipe. Gary Rhodes favours sliced brussels sprouts, rather than cabbage, with gently cooked sliced onions and mashed potato, fried in butter. He comments that although the basic ingredients of bubble and squeak and colcannon are similar, the two are very different dishes, the former being traditionally made from left-overs and fried to give a brown crust, and the latter &quot;a completely separate dish of potato, spring onion and cabbage, served almost as creamed potatoes&quot;.

Jeff Smith (1987) adds grated courgettes and chopped ham and bacon. Mark Hix (2005) adds cooked and chopped leeks and swede to the mix. Jamie Oliver (2007) adds chestnuts and &quot;whatever veg you like â carrots, Brussels, swedes, turnips, onions, leeks or Savoy cabbage&quot;. Nigel Slater, in a 2013 recipe using Christmas leftovers, adds chopped goose, ham and pumpkin to the mixture.

The mixture is then shallow fried, either shaped into round cakes or as a single panful and then sliced. The first method is suggested by Delia Smith, Hix and Slater; Rhodes finds both methods satisfactory; Dickson Wright, Oliver and Jeff Smith favour the whole-pan method.

==Outside Britain==
Bubble and squeak is familiar in Australia; a 1969 recipe adds peas and pumpkin to the basic mix. The dish is not common in the US but is not unknown; an American recipe from 1913 resembles Rundell&#x27;s version, with the addition of a border of mashed potato. In 1983 the American food writer Howard Hillman included bubble and squeak in his survey &quot;Great Peasant Dishes of the World&quot;. More recently &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine ran an article about the dish in 2004. A Canadian newspaper in 1959 reported a minor controversy about the origins of the dish, with readers variously claiming it as Australian, English, Irish and Scottish. In 1995, another Canadian paper called the dish &quot;universally beloved&quot;.

==Other uses of term==
The OED gives a secondary definition of &quot;bubble and squeak&quot;: &quot;figurative and in figurative contexts. Something resembling or suggestive of bubble and squeak, especially in consisting of a variety of elements&quot;. In 1825 a reviewer in &quot;The Morning Post&quot; dismissed a new opera at Covent Garden as &quot;a sort of bubble and squeak mixture of English and Italian&quot;. The OED gives examples from the 18th to the 21st centuries, including, from Coleridge, &quot;... the restless Bubble and Squeak of his Vanity and Discontent&quot;, and from D. H. Lawrence, &quot;I can make the most lovely bubble and squeak of a life for myself&quot;. In cockney rhyming slang the phrase was formerly used for &quot;beak&quot; (magistrate) and more recently &quot;Bubble&quot; has been used for &quot;Greek&quot;.

The term has been borrowed by authors of children&#x27;s books as names for a pair of puppies and (by two different authors) pairs of mice.

In the late 1940&#x27;s, George Moreno Jr., an American animator living and working in England, borrowed the term; re-spelling it &quot;Bubble and Squeek,&quot; for a series of cartoon shorts released by Associated British-Pathe. The star characters of Moreno&#x27;s cartoons were a humanized taxi (Squeek) and its driver (Bubble.)

<doc id="4408" wikidata="Q5977" url="?curid=4408" title="Buddy Holly">
<text>Charles Hardin Holley (September 7, 1936 â February 3, 1959), known as Buddy Holly, was an American singer, songwriter, and musician who was a central and pioneering figure of mid-1950s rock and roll. He was born to a musical family in Lubbock, Texas, during the Great Depression, and learned to play guitar and sing alongside his two siblings. 

Holly made his first appearance on local television in 1952, and the following year he formed the group Buddy and Bob with his friend Bob Montgomery. In 1955, after opening once for Elvis Presley, Holly decided to pursue a career in music. He played with Presley three times that year, and his band&#x27;s style shifted from country and western to rock and roll. In October that year, when Holly opened for Bill Haley &amp; His Comets, he was spotted by Nashville scout Eddie Crandall, who helped him get a contract with Decca Records.

Holly&#x27;s recording sessions at Decca were produced by Owen Bradley, who had become famous for producing orchestrated country hits for stars like Patsy Cline. Unhappy with Bradley&#x27;s musical style and control in the studio, Holly went to producer Norman Petty in Clovis, New Mexico, and recorded a demo of &quot;That&#x27;ll Be the Day&quot;, among other songs. Petty became the band&#x27;s manager and sent the demo to Brunswick Records, which released it as a single credited to the Crickets, a name chosen by the band to subvert Decca&#x27;s contract limitations. In September 1957, as the band toured, &quot;That&#x27;ll Be the Day&quot; topped the US and UK singles charts. Its success was followed in October by another major hit, &quot;Peggy Sue&quot;.

The album &quot;The &quot;Chirping&quot; Crickets&quot;, released in November 1957, reached number five on the UK Albums Chart. Holly made his second appearance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; in January 1958 and soon after toured Australia and then the UK. In early 1959, he assembled a new band, consisting of Waylon Jennings (bass), Tommy Allsup (guitar), and Carl Bunch (drums), and embarked on a tour of the mid-western US. After a show in Clear Lake, Iowa, Holly chartered an airplane to travel to his next show in Moorhead, Minnesota. Soon after takeoff, the plane crashed, killing Holly, Ritchie Valens, the Big Bopper, and pilot Roger Peterson in a crash later referred to by Don McLean as &quot;The Day the Music Died&quot; in his song &quot;American Pie&quot;.

During his short career, Holly wrote and recorded many songs. He is often regarded as the artist who defined the traditional rock-and-roll lineup of two guitars, bass, and drums. Holly was a major influence on later popular music artists, including Bob Dylan, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton, the Hollies, Elvis Costello and Elton John. Holly was among the first artists inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in 1986. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked him number 13 in its list of 100 Greatest Artists in 2010.

==Life and career==
===Early life and career (1936â1955)===
Charles Hardin Holley (spelled &quot;-ey&quot;) was born in Lubbock, Texas, on September 7, 1936, the youngest of four children of Lawrence Odell &quot;L.O.&quot; Holley (1901â1985) and Ella Pauline Drake (1902â1990). His elder siblings were Larry (1925â2022), Travis (1927â2016), and Patricia Lou (1929â2008). Holly was of mostly English and Welsh descent and had small amounts of Native American ancestry as well. From early childhood, Holly was nicknamed &quot;Buddy.&quot; During the Great Depression, the Holleys frequently moved residence within Lubbock; L.O. changed jobs several times. Buddy Holly was baptized a Baptist, and the family were members of the Tabernacle Baptist Church.

The Holleys had an interest in music; all the family members except L.O. were able to play an instrument or sing. The elder Holley brothers performed in local talent shows; on one occasion, Buddy joined them on violin. Since he could not play it, his brother Larry greased the bow so it would not make any sound. The brothers won the contest. During World War II, Larry and Travis were called to military service. Upon his return, Larry brought with him a guitar he had bought from a shipmate while serving in the Pacific. At age 11, at his mother&#x27;s urging, Buddy took piano lessons but abandoned them after nine months. He switched to the guitar after he saw a classmate playing and singing on the school bus. Buddy&#x27;s parents initially bought him a steel guitar, but he insisted that he wanted a guitar like his brother&#x27;s. His parents bought him an acoustic guitar from a local pawnshop, and he learned how to play it from Travis.

During his early childhood, Holly was influenced by the music of Hank Williams, Jimmie Rodgers, Moon Mullican, Bill Monroe, Hank Snow, Bob Wills, and the Carter Family. At Roscoe Wilson Elementary, Holly became friends with Bob Montgomery, and the two played together, practicing with songs by The Louvin Brothers and Johnnie &amp; Jack. They both listened to the radio programs &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; on WSM, &quot;Louisiana Hayride&quot; on KWKH, and &quot;Big D Jamboree&quot;. At the same time, Holly played with other musicians he met in high school, including Sonny Curtis and Jerry Allison. In 1952 Holly and Jack Neal participated as a duo billed as Buddy and Jack in a talent contest on a local television show. After Neal left, he was replaced by Bob Montgomery, and they were billed as Buddy and Bob. They soon started performing on the &quot;Sunday Party&quot; show on KDAV in 1953 and performed live gigs in Lubbock. At that time, Holly was influenced by late-night radio stations that played blues and rhythm and blues (R&amp;B). He would sit in his car with Curtis and tune to distant radio stations that could only be received at night, when local transmissions ceased. Holly then modified his music by blending his earlier country and western influence with R&amp;B. 

By 1955, after graduating from Lubbock High School, Holly decided to pursue a full-time career in music. He was further encouraged after seeing Elvis Presley perform live in Lubbock, whose act was booked by Pappy Dave Stone of KDAV. In February, Holly opened for Presley at the Fair Park Coliseum, in April at the Cotton Club, and again in June at the Coliseum. By that time, Holly had incorporated into his band Larry Welborn on the stand-up bass and Allison on drums, as his style shifted from country and western to rock and roll due to seeing Presley&#x27;s performances and hearing his music. In October, Stone booked Bill Haley &amp; His Comets and placed Holley as the opening act to be seen by Nashville scout Eddie Crandall. Impressed, Crandall persuaded Grand Ole Opry manager Jim Denny to seek a recording contract for Holley. Stone sent a demo tape, which Denny forwarded to Paul Cohen, who signed the band to Decca Records in February 1956. In the contract, Decca misspelled Holly&#x27;s surname as &quot;Holly&quot;, and from then on he was known as Buddy Holly, instead of his real name Holley.

On January 26, 1956, Holly attended his first formal recording session, which was produced by Owen Bradley. He attended two more sessions in Nashville, but with the producer selecting the session musicians and arrangements, Holly became increasingly frustrated by his lack of creative control. In April 1956, Decca released &quot;Blue Days, Black Nights&quot; as a single, with &quot;Love Me&quot; on the B-side. Denny included Holly on a tour as the opening act for Faron Young. During the tour, they were promoted as Buddy Holly and the Two Tones, while later Decca called them Buddy Holly and the Three Tunes. The label later released Holly&#x27;s second single &quot;Modern Don Juan&quot;, backed with &quot;You Are My One Desire&quot;. Neither single made an impression. On January 22, 1957, Decca informed Holly his contract would not be renewed, but insisted he could not record the same songs for anyone else for five years.

===The Crickets (1956â1957) ===
Holly was unhappy with the results of his time with Decca, and inspired by the success of Buddy Knox&#x27;s &quot;Party Doll&quot; and Jimmy Bowen&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Stickin&#x27; with You&quot;, he visited Norman Petty, who had produced and promoted both records. Together with Allison, bassist Joe B. Mauldin, and rhythm guitarist Niki Sullivan, he went to Petty&#x27;s studio in Clovis, New Mexico. The group recorded a demo of &quot;That&#x27;ll Be the Day&quot;, a song they had previously recorded in Nashville. In June 1956, Holly along with his older brother Larry as well as Allison and Sonny Curtis had gone to see the film &quot;The Searchers&quot;, starring John Wayne, in which Wayne repeatedly used the phrase &quot;That&#x27;ll be the day&quot;. This line of dialogue inspired the young musicians. Now playing lead guitar, Holly achieved the sound he desired. Petty became his manager and sent the record to Brunswick Records in New York City. Holly, still under contract with Decca, could not release the record under his name, so a band name was used; Allison proposed the name &quot;Crickets.&quot; Brunswick gave Holly a basic agreement to release &quot;That&#x27;ll Be the Day&quot;, leaving him with both artistic control and financial responsibility for future recordings.

Impressed with the demo, the label&#x27;s executives released it without recording a new version. &quot;I&#x27;m Looking for Someone to Love&quot; was the B-side; the single was credited to The Crickets. Petty and Holly later learned that Brunswick was a subsidiary of Decca, which legally cleared future recordings under the name Buddy Holly. Recordings credited to the Crickets would be released on Brunswick, while the recordings under Holly&#x27;s name were released on another subsidiary label, Coral Records. Holly concurrently held a recording contract with both labels.

Norman Petty reasoned correctly that disc jockeys would be reluctant to play and promote multiple new records by the same artist, but would have no problem playing these same records if they were credited to different performers. Holly himself was unaware of this strategy; in a 1957 radio interview with Dale Lowery, Holly said, &quot;We have three records going out right now. Of course, the first one was &#x27;That&#x27;ll Be the Day&#x27;, the first one released. Then we have a new one out by The Crickets, called &#x27;Oh Boy!&#x27; and &#x27;Not Fade Away&#x27;, and then there&#x27;s one out, it&#x27;s the same group but it&#x27;s under my name -- I don&#x27;t know why they did it that way, but it went out under my name -- called &#x27;Peggy Sue&#x27; and &#x27;Everyday&#x27;.&quot; Holly&#x27;s records were released with labels reading &quot;Buddy Holly&quot; &quot;or&quot; &quot;The Crickets&quot;; the band was never credited on records as &quot;Buddy Holly &quot;and&quot; the Crickets&quot; until 1962, when a compilation album was released.

&quot;That&#x27;ll Be the Day&quot; was released on July 27, 1957. Petty booked Holly and the Crickets for a tour with Irvin Feld, who had noticed the band after &quot;That&#x27;ll Be the Day&quot; appeared on the R&amp;B chart. He booked them for appearances in Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and New York City. The band was booked to play at New York&#x27;s Apollo Theater on August 16â22. During the opening performances, the group did not impress the audience, but they were accepted after they included &quot;Bo Diddley.&quot; By the end of their run at the Apollo, &quot;That&#x27;ll Be the Day&quot; was climbing the charts. Encouraged by the single&#x27;s success, Petty started to prepare two album releases; a solo album for Holly and another for the Crickets. Holly appeared on &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, hosted by Dick Clark on ABC, on August 26. Before leaving New York, the band befriended The Everly Brothers.
&quot;That&#x27;ll Be the Day&quot; topped the US &quot;Best Sellers in Stores&quot; chart on September 23 and was number one on the UK Singles Chart for three weeks in November. Three days prior, Coral released &quot;Peggy Sue&quot;, backed with &quot;Everyday&quot;, with Holly credited as the performer. By October, &quot;Peggy Sue&quot; had reached number three on &quot;Billboard&quot;â³s pop chart and number two on the R&amp;B chart; it peaked at number six on the UK Singles chart. As the success of the song grew, it brought more attention to Holly, with the band at the time being billed as &quot;Buddy Holly and the Crickets&quot; (although never on records during Holly&#x27;s lifetime).

In the last week of September, the band members flew to Lubbock to visit their families. Holly&#x27;s high school girlfriend, Echo McGuire, had left him for a fellow student. Aside from McGuire, Holly had a relationship with Lubbock fan June Clark. After Clark ended their relationship, Holly realized the importance of his relationship with McGuire and considered his relationship with Clark a temporary one. Meanwhile, for their return to recording, Petty arranged a session in Oklahoma City, where he was performing with his own band. While the band drove to the location, the producer set up a makeshift studio. The rest of the songs needed for an album and singles were recorded; Petty later dubbed the material in Clovis. The resulting album, &quot;The &quot;Chirping&quot; Crickets&quot;, was released on November 27, 1957. It reached number five on the UK Albums Chart. In October, Brunswick released the second single by the Crickets, &quot;Oh, Boy!&quot;, with &quot;Not Fade Away&quot; on the B-side. The single reached number 10 on the pop chart and 13 on the R&amp;B chart. Holly and the Crickets performed &quot;That&#x27;ll Be the Day&quot; and &quot;Peggy Sue&quot; on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; on December 1, 1957. Following the appearance, Niki Sullivan left the group because he was tired of the intensive touring, and wished to resume his education. On December 29, Holly and the Crickets performed &quot;Peggy Sue&quot; on &quot;The Arthur Murray Party&quot;.

===International tours and split (1958)===
On January 8, 1958, Holly and the Crickets joined &quot;America&#x27;s Greatest Teenage Recording Stars&quot; tour. On January 25, Holly recorded &quot;Rave On&quot;; the next day, he made his second appearance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, singing &quot;Oh, Boy!&quot; Holly departed to perform in Honolulu, Hawaii, on January 27, and then started a week-long tour of Australia billed as the &quot;Big Show&quot; with Paul Anka, Jerry Lee Lewis and Jodie Sands. In March, the band toured the United Kingdom, playing 50 shows in 25 days. The same month, his debut solo album, &quot;Buddy Holly&quot;, was released. Upon their return to the United States, Holly and the Crickets joined Alan Freed&#x27;s &quot;Big Beat Show&quot; tour for 41 dates. In April, Decca released &quot;That&#x27;ll Be the Day&quot;, featuring the songs recorded with Bradley during his early Nashville sessions.

A new recording session in Clovis was arranged in May; Holly hired Tommy Allsup to play lead guitar. The session produced the recordings of &quot;It&#x27;s So Easy&quot; and &quot;Heartbeat.&quot; Holly was impressed by Allsup and invited him to join the Crickets. In June, Holly traveled alone to New York for a solo recording session. Without the Crickets, he chose to be backed by a jazz and R&amp;B band, recording &quot;Now We&#x27;re One&quot; and Bobby Darin&#x27;s &quot;Early in the Morning.&quot;

During a visit to the offices of Peer-Southern, Holly met MarÃ­a Elena Santiago. He asked her out on their first meeting and proposed marriage to her on their first date. The wedding took place on August 15. Norman Petty had tried to dissuade Holly from marriage; he felt that it would disappoint Holly&#x27;s public and damage his career.

Holly and Santiago frequented many of New York&#x27;s music venues, including the Village Gate, Blue Note, Village Vanguard, and Johnny Johnson&#x27;s. Santiago later said that Holly was keen to learn fingerstyle flamenco guitar and that he would often visit her aunt&#x27;s home to play the piano there. Holly planned collaborations between soul singers and rock and roll. He wanted to make an album with Ray Charles and Mahalia Jackson. Holly also had ambitions to work in film and registered for acting classes with Lee Strasberg&#x27;s Actors Studio.

Santiago accompanied Holly on tours. To hide her marriage to Holly, she was presented as the Crickets&#x27; secretary. She took care of the laundry and equipment set-up and collected the concert revenues. Santiago kept the money for the band instead of its habitual transfer to Petty in New Mexico. She and her aunt Provi Garcia, an executive in the Latin American music department at Peer-Southern, convinced Holly that Petty was paying the band&#x27;s royalties from Coral-Brunswick into his own company&#x27;s account. Holly planned to retrieve his royalties from Petty and later to fire him as manager and producer. At the recommendation of the Everly Brothers, Holly hired lawyer Harold Orenstein to negotiate his royalties. The problems with Petty were triggered after he was unable to pay Holly. At the time, New York promoter Manny Greenfield reclaimed a large part of Holly&#x27;s earnings; Greenfield had booked Holly for shows during previous tours. The two had a verbal agreement; Greenfield would obtain 5% of the booking earnings. Greenfield later felt he was also acting as Holly&#x27;s manager and deserved a higher payment, which Holly refused. Greenfield then sued Holly. Under New York law, because Holly&#x27;s royalties originated in New York and were directed out of the state, the payments were frozen until the dispute was settled.

In September, Holly returned to Clovis for a new recording session, which yielded &quot;Reminiscing&quot; and &quot;Come Back Baby.&quot; During the session, he ventured into producing by recording Lubbock DJ Waylon Jennings. Holly produced the single &quot;Jole Blon&quot; and &quot;When Sin Stops (Love Begins)&quot; for Jennings. Holly became increasingly interested in the New York music, recording, and publishing scene. Holly and Santiago settled in Apartment 4H of the Brevoort Apartments, at 11 Fifth Avenue in Greenwich Village, where he recorded a series of acoustic songs, including &quot;Crying, Waiting, Hoping&quot; and &quot;What to Do.&quot; The inspiration to record the songs is sometimes attributed to the ending of his relationship with McGuire.

On October 21, 1958, Holly&#x27;s final studio session was recorded at the Pythian Temple on West 70th Street (now a luxury condominium). Known by Holly fans as &quot;the string sessions&quot;, Holly recorded four songs for Coral in an innovative collaboration with an 18-piece ensemble composed of former members of the NBC Symphony Orchestra (including saxophonist Boomie Richman) under the direction of Dick Jacobs.

The four songs recorded during the -hour session were: 
*&quot;True Love Ways&quot; (written by Buddy Holly), 
*&quot;Moondreams&quot; (written by Norman Petty), 
*&quot;Raining in My Heart&quot; (written by Felice and Boudleaux Bryant) and 
*&quot;It Doesn&#x27;t Matter Anymore&quot; (written by Paul Anka).
These four songs were the only ones Coral ever mixed in stereo, but only &quot;Raining in My Heart&quot; was released that way (in 1959, on an obscure promotional LP titled &quot;Hitsville&quot;). All four records otherwise received releases in mono. The original stereo mixes were consulted many years later for compilation albums.

Holly ended his association with Petty in December 1958. His band members kept Petty as their manager and split from Holly. The split was amicable and based on logistics: Holly had decided to settle permanently in New York, where the business and publishing offices were, and the Crickets preferred not to leave their home state.

===Winter Dance Party tour and death (1959)===

Holly vacationed with his wife in Lubbock and visited Jennings&#x27;s radio station in December 1958. For the start of the Winter Dance Party tour, he assembled a band consisting of Waylon Jennings (electric bass), Tommy Allsup (guitar), and Carl Bunch (drums). Holly and Jennings left for New York City, arriving on January 15, 1959. Jennings stayed at Holly&#x27;s apartment by Washington Square Park on the days prior to a meeting scheduled at the headquarters of the General Artists Corporation, which organized the tour. They then traveled by train to Chicago to join the rest of the band.
The Winter Dance Party tour began in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on January 23, 1959. The amount of travel involved created logistical problems, as the distance between venues had not been considered when scheduling performances. Adding to the problem, the unheated tour buses twice broke down in freezing weather, with dire consequences. Holly&#x27;s drummer, Carl Bunch, was hospitalized for frostbite to his toes (sustained while aboard the bus), so Holly decided to seek other transportation. On February 2, before their appearance in Clear Lake, Iowa, Holly chartered a four-seat Beechcraft Bonanza airplane for Jennings, Allsup, and himself, from Dwyer Flying Service in Mason City, Iowa. Holly&#x27;s idea was to depart following the show at the Surf Ballroom in Clear Lake and fly to their next venue, in Moorhead, Minnesota, via Fargo, North Dakota, allowing them time to rest and launder their clothes and avoid an arduous bus journey. Immediately after the Clear Lake show (which ended just before midnight), Allsup agreed to flip a coin for the seat with Ritchie Valens. Valens called heads; when he won, he reportedly said, &quot;That&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve ever won anything in my life.&quot; Allsup later opened a restaurant/bar in Fort Worth, Texas, called Heads Up Saloon. Waylon Jennings voluntarily gave up his seat to J. P. Richardson (the Big Bopper), who had influenza and complained that the tour bus was too cold and uncomfortable for a man of his size.

The pilot, Roger Peterson, took off in inclement weather, even though he was not certified to fly by instruments only. Buddy&#x27;s brother Larry Holley said, &quot;I got the full report from the Civil Aeronautics â it took me a year to get it, but I got it â and they had installed a new Sperry gyroscope in the airplane. The Sperry works different than any other gyro. One of them, the background moves and the plane stays like this [stationary], and in the other one the background stays steady and the plane moves, it works just backwards. He [the pilot] could have been reading this backwards... they were going down, they thought they were still climbing.&quot;

Shortly after 1:00Â a.m. on February 3, 1959, Holly, Valens, Richardson, and Peterson were killed when the aircraft crashed into a cornfield five miles northwest of Clear Lake shortly after takeoff. The three musicians, who were ejected from the fuselage upon impact, sustained severe head and chest injuries. Holly was 22 years old.

The report did not mention a gun belonging to Holly that was found by a farmer two months after the crash. Newspaper accounts of the gun discovery fueled rumors among fans that the pilot was somehow shot, causing the crash. Another curious finding at the crash was that Richardson&#x27;s body was discovered nearly away from the crash while the others were found in or near the wreckage. However, an autopsy done at the request of Richardson&#x27;s son in 2007 found no evidence to support the rumors. Dr. Bill Bass, a forensic anthropologist at the University of Tennessee, stated that &quot;There was no indication of foul play,&quot; and that Richardson &quot;died immediately.&quot;
Holly&#x27;s funeral was held on February 7, 1959, at the Tabernacle Baptist Church in Lubbock. The service was officiated by Ben D. Johnson, who had presided at the Hollys&#x27; wedding just months earlier. The pallbearers were Jerry Allison, Joe B. Mauldin, Niki Sullivan, Bob Montgomery, and Sonny Curtis. Some sources say that Phil Everly, one half of The Everly Brothers, was also pallbearer, but Everly said that he attended the funeral but was not a pallbearer. Waylon Jennings was unable to attend because of his commitment to the still-touring Winter Dance Party. Holly&#x27;s body was interred in the City of Lubbock Cemetery, in the eastern part of the city. Holly&#x27;s headstone carries the correct spelling of his surname (Holley) and a carving of his Fender Stratocaster guitar.

Santiago watched the first reports of Holly&#x27;s death on television. The following day, she suffered a miscarriage. Holly&#x27;s mother, who heard the news on the radio in Lubbock, Texas, screamed and collapsed. Because of Elena&#x27;s miscarriage, in the months following the accident, some government authorities implemented a policy against announcing victims&#x27; names until after families are informed. Santiago did not attend the funeral and has never visited the gravesite. She later told the &quot;Avalanche-Journal&quot;, &quot;In a way, I blame myself. I was not feeling well when he left. I was two weeks pregnant, and I wanted Buddy to stay with me, but he had scheduled that tour. It was the only time I wasn&#x27;t with him. And I blame myself because I know that, if only I had gone along, Buddy never would have gotten into that airplane.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Holly married MarÃ­a Elena Santiago, a New York record company receptionist, on August 15, 1958, at Tabernacle Baptist Church in his hometown of Lubbock, Texas. In 1959, Santiago was pregnant with their first child, but suffered a miscarriage immediately after Holly&#x27;s death. They had only been married for six months.

Peggy Sue Gerron was the inspiration behind Holly&#x27;s hit song &quot;Peggy Sue&quot;. Holly and Gerron had a flirtatious relationship, and Gerron had known Holly since her schooldays when she was dating drummer Jerry Allison. Gerron married Allison on July 22, 1958. The two newlywed couples had a shared honeymoon in Acapulco, Mexico.

Holly&#x27;s own marriage to Santiago was distant and tense, and the couple were supposedly headed for divorce. In late 1958, Holly had also encouraged Gerron to divorce Allison over his drunken behavior, but she declined. The act of divorce went against her Catholic beliefs (however, Gerron eventually did divorce Allison in 1965). In December 1958, Holly recorded a demo of one of his last songs &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot;âabout Gerron and Allison&#x27;s marriage.

==Image and style==
Holly&#x27;s singing style was characterized by his vocal hiccups, a technique he acquired after hearing Elvis do it in 1955 on the Hayride show, and his alternation between his regular voice and falsetto. Holly&#x27;s &quot;stuttering vocals&quot; were complemented by his percussive guitar playing, solos, stops, bent notes, and rhythm and blues chord progressions. He often strummed downstrokes that were accompanied by Allison&#x27;s percussion.

Holly bought his first Fender Stratocaster, which became his signature guitar, at Harrod Music in Lubbock. His innovative playing style was characterized by its blending of chunky rhythm and high string lead work. Holly played his first 1954 Stratocaster until it was stolen during a tour stop in Michigan in 1957. To replace it, he purchased a 1957 model before a show in Detroit. Holly owned four or five Stratocasters during his career.

At the beginning of their music careers, Holly and his group wore business suits. When they met the Everly Brothers, Don Everly took the band to Phil&#x27;s Men&#x27;s Shop in New York City and introduced them to Ivy League clothes. The brothers advised Holly to replace his old-fashioned glasses with horn-rimmed glasses, which had been popularized by Steve Allen. Holly bought a pair of glasses made in Mexico from Lubbock optometrist Dr. J. Davis Armistead. Teenagers in the United States started to request this style of glasses, which were later popularly known as &quot;Buddy Holly glasses.&quot;

While Holly&#x27;s other belongings were recovered immediately following his fatal plane crash, there was no record of his signature glasses being found. They were presumed lost until, in March 1980, they were discovered in a Cerro Gordo County courthouse storage area by Sheriff Gerald Allen. They had been found in the spring of 1959, after the snow had melted, and had been given to the sheriff&#x27;s office. They were placed in an envelope dated April 7, 1959, along with the Big Bopper&#x27;s watch, a lighter, two pairs of dice and part of another watch, and misplaced when the county moved courthouses. The glasses frames were returned to Santiago a year later, after a legal contest over them with his parents. They are now on display at the Buddy Holly Center in Lubbock, Texas.

The rarest and only known Buddy Holly poster from &quot;The Day the Music Died,&quot; was sold at Heritage Auctions for a record-breaking $447,000 in 2022.

==Legacy==
Buddy Holly left behind dozens of unfinished recordingsÂ â solo transcriptions of his new compositions, informal jam sessions with bandmates, and tapes demonstrating songs intended for other artists. The last known recordings, made in Holly&#x27;s apartment in late 1958, were his last six original songs. In June 1959, Coral Records overdubbed two of them with backing vocals by the Ray Charles Singers and studio musicians in an attempt to simulate the established Crickets sound. The finished tracks became the first posthumous Holly single, &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot;/&quot;Crying, Waiting, Hoping.&quot; The new release was successful enough to warrant an album drawing upon the other Holly demos, using the same studio personnel, in January 1960. All six songs were included in &quot;The Buddy Holly Story, Vol. 2&quot; (1960).

The demand for Holly records was so great (although none saw much chart success on the US billboards), and Holly had recorded so prolifically, that his record label was able to release new Holly albums and singles for the next 10 years. Norman Petty produced most of these new editions, drawing upon unreleased studio masters, alternate takes, audition tapes, and even amateur recordings (some dating back to 1954 with low-fidelity vocals). The final &quot;new&quot; Buddy Holly album, &quot;Giant&quot;, was released in 1969; the single chosen from the album was &quot;Love Is Strange.&quot;
&quot;EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica&quot; stated that Holly &quot;produced some of the most distinctive and influential work in rock music.&quot; AllMusic defined him as &quot;the single most influential creative force in early rock and roll.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked him number 13 on its list of &quot;100 Greatest Artists.&quot; The &quot;Telegraph&quot; called him a &quot;pioneer and a revolutionary [...] a multidimensional talent [...] (who) co-wrote and performed (songs that) remain as fresh and potent today.&quot; In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Holly at number 74 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame included Holly among its first class in 1986. On its entry, the Hall of Fame remarked upon the large quantity of material he produced during his short musical career, and said it &quot;made a major and lasting impact on popular music.&quot; It called him an &quot;innovator&quot; for writing his own material, his experimentation with double tracking and the use of orchestration; he is also said to have &quot;pioneered and popularized the now-standard&quot; use of two guitars, bass, and drums by rock bands. The Songwriters Hall of Fame also inducted Holly in 1986, and said his contributions &quot;changed the face of Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll.&quot; Holly developed in collaboration with Petty techniques of overdubbing and reverb, while he used innovative instrumentation later implemented by other artists. Holly became &quot;one of the most influential pioneers of rock and roll&quot; who had a &quot;lasting influence&quot; on genre performers of the 1960s.
In 1980, Grant Speed sculpted a statue of Holly playing his Fender guitar. This statue is the centerpiece of Lubbock&#x27;s Walk of Fame, which honors notable people who contributed to Lubbock&#x27;s musical history. Other memorials to Buddy Holly include a street named in his honor and the Buddy Holly Center, which contains a museum of Holly memorabilia and fine arts gallery. The center is located on Crickets Avenue, one street east of Buddy Holly Avenue, in a building that previously housed the Fort Worth and Denver South Plains Railway Depot. In 2010, the statue was taken down for refurbishment, and construction of a new Walk of Fame began.

In 1997, the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences gave Holly the Lifetime Achievement Award. He was inducted into the Iowa Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Hall of Fame in 2000. On May 9, 2011, the City of Lubbock held a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the Buddy and Maria Elena Holly Plaza, the new home of the statue and the Walk of Fame. On what would have been his 75th birthday, a star bearing Holly&#x27;s name was placed on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Groundbreaking was held on April 20, 2017, for the construction of a new performing arts center in Lubbock, the Buddy Holly Hall of Performing Arts and Sciences, a downtown $153Â million project expected to be completed in 2020. Thus far, the private group, the Lubbock Entertainment and Performing Arts Association, has raised or received pledges in the amount of $93Â million to underwrite the project.

According to a June 2019 article in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;, &quot;virtually all&quot; of Holly&#x27;s masters were lost in the 2008 Universal fire. This is disputed by Chad Kassem of Analogue Productions, who claims to have used the master tapes of Holly&#x27;s first two albums in Analogue Productions reissues of these albums on LP and SACD in 2017.

===Influence===

==== The Beatles ====
John Lennon and Paul McCartney saw Holly for the first time when he appeared on &quot;Sunday Night at the London Palladium&quot;. The two had recently met and begun their musical association. They studied Holly&#x27;s records, learned his performance style and lyricism, and based their act around his persona. Inspired by Holly&#x27;s insect-themed Crickets, they chose to name their band &quot;the Beatles&quot;. Lennon and McCartney later cited Holly as one of their main influences.

Lennon&#x27;s band the Quarrymen covered &quot;That&#x27;ll Be the Day&quot; in their first recording session, in 1958. During breaks in the Beatles&#x27; first appearance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, on February 9, 1964, Lennon asked CBS coordinator Vince Calandra about Holly&#x27;s performances; Calandra said Lennon and McCartney repeatedly expressed their appreciation of Holly. The Beatles recorded a close cover of Holly&#x27;s version of &quot;Words of Love&quot;, which was released on their 1964 album &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; (in the US, in June 1965 on &quot;Beatles VI&quot;). During the January 1969 recording sessions for their album &quot;Let It Be&quot;, the Beatles played a slow, impromptu version of &quot;Mailman, Bring Me No More Blues&quot; â which Holly popularized but did not write â with Lennon mimicking Holly&#x27;s vocal style. Lennon recorded a cover version of &quot;Peggy Sue&quot; on his 1975 album &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;. McCartney owns the publishing rights to Holly&#x27;s song catalog.

==== Bob Dylan ====
On January 31, 1959, two nights before Holly&#x27;s death, 17-year-old Bob Dylan attended Holly&#x27;s performance in Duluth. Dylan referred to this in his acceptance speech when he received the Grammy Award for Album of the Year for &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; in 1998: &quot;...Â when I was sixteen or seventeen years old, I went to see Buddy Holly play at Duluth National Guard Armory and I was three feet away from himÂ ... and he looked at me. And I just have some sort of feeling that he wasÂ ... with us all the time we were making this record in some kind of way.&quot;

==== The Rolling Stones ====
Mick Jagger saw Holly performing live in Woolwich, London, during a tour of the UK; Jagger particularly remembered Holly&#x27;s performance of &quot;Not Fade Away&quot; â a song that also inspired Keith Richards, who modeled his early guitar playing on the track. The Rolling Stones had a hit version of the song in 1964. Richards later said, &quot;[Holly] passed it on via the Beatles and via [the Rolling Stones]Â ...Â He&#x27;s in everybody.&quot;

==== Steve Marriott ====
From a young age, Steve Marriott was a huge fan of Holly and would mimic his hero by wearing large-rimmed spectacles with the lenses removed. Marriott wrote his first song, called &quot;Shelia My Dear&quot;, after his aunt Shelia to whom he was close. Those who heard the song said it was played at a jaunty pace in the style of Holly and his bandmates also nicknamed him &#x27;Buddy&#x27;. Marriott also recorded a version of Kenny Lynch&#x27;s song &quot;Give Her My Regards&quot; b/w &quot;Imaginary Love&quot;, the B-side written by Marriott, and released as a 45-rpm in 1963 on Decca, inspired by Buddy Holly and the Crickets. His band, Humble Pie released a cover version of &quot;Heartbeat&quot; on their 1969 album &quot;Town and Country&quot;.

==== Don McLean ====
Don McLean&#x27;s popular 1971 ballad &quot;American Pie&quot; was inspired by Holly&#x27;s death and the day of the plane crash. The song&#x27;s lyric, which calls the incident &quot;The Day the Music Died&quot;, became popularly associated with the crash. McLean&#x27;s album &quot;American Pie&quot; is dedicated to Holly. In 2015, McLean wrote, &quot;Buddy Holly would have the same stature musically whether he would have lived or died, because of his accomplishmentsÂ ...Â By the time he was 22 years old, he had recorded some 50 tracks, most of which he had written himselfÂ ...Â in my view and the view of many others, a hitÂ ...Â Buddy Holly and the Crickets were the template for all the rock bands that followed.&quot;

==== Eric Clapton ====
&quot;The Chirping Crickets&quot; was the first album Eric Clapton ever bought; he later saw Holly on &quot;Sunday Night at the London Palladium&quot;. In his autobiography, Clapton recounted the first time he saw Holly and his Fender, saying, &quot;I thought I&#x27;d died and gone to heavenÂ ...Â it was like seeing an instrument from outer space and I said to myself: &#x27;That&#x27;s the future â that&#x27;s what I want. In 1969, his supergroup Blind Faith released a cover version of Holly&#x27;s &quot;Well All Right&quot; featuring Steve Winwood on vocals.

====Bobby Vee====
The launch of Bobby Vee&#x27;s successful musical career resulted from Holly&#x27;s death; Vee was selected to replace Holly on the tour that continued after the plane crash. Holly&#x27;s profound influence on Vee&#x27;s singing style can be heard in the songs &quot;Rubber Ball&quot; â the B-side of which was a cover of Holly&#x27;s &quot;Everyday&quot; â and &quot;Run to Him.&quot;

====The Hollies====
The name of the British rock band the Hollies is often claimed as a tribute to Holly; according to the band, they admired Holly, but their name was mainly inspired by sprigs of holly in evidence around Christmas 1962.

====Phil Ochs====
In 1970, protest folk singer Phil Ochs released his sarcastic &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; (1970) album, and eventually, his live album &quot;Gunfight at Carnegie Hall&quot; (1974). During his concert at Carnegie Hall on March 27, 1970, Phil Ochs performed his &quot;Buddy Holly Medley&quot; comprising Holly&#x27;s songs &quot;Not Fade Away&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Love You Too&quot;, &quot;Think It Over&quot;, &quot;Oh, Boy!&quot;, &quot;Everyday&quot;, and &quot;It&#x27;s So Easy&quot;. Before performing the medley, Ochs announced to the audience, &quot;We&#x27;re going to do a medley of songs of one of the greatest musicians that ever lived, a man who died prematurely, a man who had a big influence on meÂ ...Â Before I became a protest and folk singer, I had memorized many other things before Pete Seeger, before Bob Dylan, before the Weavers, before anything you might have ever heard in New York City, and this is Buddy Holly.&quot;

====Elvis Costello====
During the height of punk, Elvis Costello resembled Holly. He wore his stylized glasses and dressed like him. Bob Dylan on Costello, from his 2022 book &quot;The Philosophy of Modern Song&quot;, &quot;Elvis Costello and the Attractions were a better band than any of their contemporaries. Light years better. Elvis himself was a unique figure. Horn-rimmed glasses, quirky, pigeon-toed and intense. The only singer-guitarist in the band. You couldn&#x27;t say that he didn&#x27;t remind you of Buddy Holly. The Buddy stereotype. At least on the surface. Elvis had Harold Lloyd in his DNA as well. At the point of âPump It Upâ, he obviously had been listening to Springsteen too much. But he also had a heavy dose of &#x27;Subterranean Homesick Blues&#x27;.&quot;

====Bruce Springsteen====
In an August 24, 1978, interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Bruce Springsteen told Dave Marsh, &quot;I play Buddy Holly every night before I go on; that keeps me honest.&quot;

====Grateful Dead====
The Grateful Dead performed the song &quot;Not Fade Away&quot; in concerts.

====Richard Barone====
In 2016, Richard Barone released his album &quot;Sorrows &amp; Promises: Greenwich Village in the 1960s&quot;, paying tribute to the new wave of singer-songwriters in the Village during that pivotal, post-Holly era. The album opens with Barone&#x27;s version of &quot;Learning the Game&quot;, one of the final songs written and recorded by Holly at his home in Greenwich Village, a week before his death.

===Film and musical depictions===
====Film====
Holly&#x27;s life story inspired a Hollywood biographical film, &quot;The Buddy Holly Story&quot; (1978); its lead actor Gary Busey received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Holly. The film was widely criticized by the rock press, and by Holly&#x27;s friends and family, for its inaccuracies. This led Paul McCartney (whose MPL Communications by then controlled the publishing rights to Buddy Holly&#x27;s song catalog) to produce and host his own documentary about Holly in 1985, titled &quot;The Real Buddy Holly Story&quot;. This video includes interviews with Keith Richards, Phil and Don Everly, Sonny Curtis, Jerry Allison, Holly&#x27;s family, and McCartney, among others.

In 1987, musician Marshall Crenshaw portrayed Buddy Holly in the movie &quot;La Bamba&quot;, which depicts him performing at the Surf Ballroom and boarding the fatal airplane with Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper. Crenshaw&#x27;s version of &quot;Crying, Waiting, Hoping&quot; is featured on the &quot;La Bamba&quot; original motion picture soundtrack.

Holly&#x27;s follow up to the hit song &quot;Peggy Sue&quot; is featured in the 1986 Francis Ford Coppola film &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot;, in which a 43-year-old mother and housewife facing divorce played by Kathleen Turner is thrust back in time and given the chance to change the course of her life.

Steve Buscemi appeared as Holly in a brief cameo as a 1950s-themed restaurant employee in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s 1994 film &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, in which he takes Mia Wallace and Vincent Vega&#x27;s orders (portrayed respectively by Uma Thurman and John Travolta).

In 1998, the post-apocalyptic film &quot;Six-String Samurai&quot; depicted Holly as a guitar-playing samurai traveling to Las Vegas to become the new king of Nevada after the death of Elvis Presley.

==== Television ====
Holly was depicted in a 1989 episode of the science-fiction television program &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; titled &quot;How the Tess Was Won&quot;; Holly&#x27;s identity is only revealed at the end of the episode. Dr. Sam Beckett (Scott Bakula) influences Buddy Holly to change his lyrics from &quot;piggy, suey&quot; to &quot;Peggy Sue&quot;, setting up Holly&#x27;s future hit song.

In the animated series &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot;, it is implied that the elderly villains Dragoon and Red Mantle are actually Richardson and Buddy Holly, who were recruited into the supervillain organization the Guild of Calamitous Intent on the night of their supposed deaths.

The TV documentaries &quot;Without Walls: Not Fade Away&quot; (aired on Channel Four in 1996), and &quot;Buddy Holly: Rave On&quot; (aired on BBC Four in 2017). The 2022 documentary &quot;The Day the Music Died&quot; explores the story behind Don McLean&#x27;s song &quot;American Pie&quot;.

<text>Brewing is the production of beer by steeping a starch source (commonly cereal grains, the most popular of which is barley) in water and fermenting the resulting sweet liquid with yeast. It may be done in a brewery by a commercial brewer, at home by a homebrewer, or communally. Brewing has taken place since around the 6th millennium BC, and archaeological evidence suggests that emerging civilizations, including ancient Egypt, China, and Mesopotamia, brewed beer. Since the nineteenth century the brewing industry has been part of most western economies.

The basic ingredients of beer are water and a fermentable starch source such as malted barley. Most beer is fermented with a brewer&#x27;s yeast and flavoured with hops. Less widely used starch sources include millet, sorghum and cassava. Secondary sources (adjuncts), such as maize (corn), rice, or sugar, may also be used, sometimes to reduce cost, or to add a feature, such as adding wheat to aid in retaining the foamy head of the beer. The most common starch source is ground cereal or &quot;grist&quot; â the proportion of the starch or cereal ingredients in a beer recipe may be called grist, grain bill, or simply mash ingredients.

Steps in the brewing process include malting, milling, mashing, lautering, boiling, fermenting, conditioning, filtering, and packaging. There are three main fermentation methods: warm, cool and spontaneous. Fermentation may take place in an open or closed fermenting vessel; a secondary fermentation may also occur in the cask or bottle. There are several additional brewing methods, such as Burtonisation, double dropping, and Yorkshire Square, as well as post-fermentation treatment such as filtering, and barrel-ageing.

==History==
Brewing has taken place since around the 6th millennium BC, and archaeological evidence suggests emerging civilizations including China, ancient Egypt, and Mesopotamia brewed beer. Descriptions of various beer recipes can be found in cuneiform (the oldest known writing) from ancient Mesopotamia. In Mesopotamia the brewer&#x27;s craft was the only profession which derived social sanction and divine protection from female deities/goddesses, specifically: Ninkasi, who covered the production of beer, Siris, who was used in a metonymic way to refer to beer, and Siduri, who covered the enjoyment of beer. In pre-industrial times, and in developing countries, women are frequently the main brewers.

As almost any cereal containing certain sugars can undergo spontaneous fermentation due to wild yeasts in the air, it is possible that beer-like beverages were independently developed throughout the world soon after a tribe or culture had domesticated cereal. Chemical tests of ancient pottery jars reveal that beer was produced as far back as about 7,000 years ago in what is today Iran. This discovery reveals one of the earliest known uses of fermentation and is the earliest evidence of brewing to date. In Mesopotamia, the oldest evidence of beer is believed to be a 6,000-year-old Sumerian tablet depicting people drinking a beverage through reed straws from a communal bowl. A 3900-year-old Sumerian poem honouring Ninkasi, the patron goddess of brewing, contains the oldest surviving beer recipe, describing the production of beer from barley via bread. The invention of bread and beer has been argued to be responsible for humanity&#x27;s ability to develop technology and build civilization. The earliest chemically confirmed barley beer to date was discovered at Godin Tepe in the central Zagros Mountains of Iran, where fragments of a jug, at least 5,000 years old was found to be coated with beerstone, a by-product of the brewing process. Beer may have been known in Neolithic Europe as far back as 5,000 years ago, and was mainly brewed on a domestic scale.

Ale produced before the Industrial Revolution continued to be made and sold on a domestic scale, although by the 7th century AD beer was also being produced and sold by European monasteries. During the Industrial Revolution, the production of beer moved from artisanal manufacture to industrial manufacture, and domestic manufacture ceased to be significant by the end of the 19th century. The development of hydrometers and thermometers changed brewing by allowing the brewer more control of the process, and greater knowledge of the results. Today, the brewing industry is a global business, consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries. More than 133Â billion litres (35Â billion gallons) are sold per yearâproducing total global revenues of $294.5Â billion (Â£147.7Â billion) in 2006.

==Ingredients==
The basic ingredients of beer are water; a starch source, such as malted barley, able to be fermented (converted into alcohol); a brewer&#x27;s yeast to produce the fermentation; and a flavouring, such as hops, to offset the sweetness of the malt. A mixture of starch sources may be used, with a secondary saccharide, such as maize (corn), rice, or sugar, these often being termed adjuncts, especially when used as a lower-cost substitute for malted barley. Less widely used starch sources include millet, sorghum, and cassava root in Africa, potato in Brazil, and agave in Mexico, among others. The most common starch source is ground cereal or &quot;grist&quot; â the proportion of the starch or cereal ingredients in a beer recipe may be called grist, grain bill, or simply mash ingredients.

;Water
Beer is composed mostly of water. Regions have water with different mineral components; as a result, different regions were originally better suited to making certain types of beer, thus giving them a regional character. For example, Dublin has hard water well suited to making stout, such as Guinness; while Pilsen has soft water well suited to making pale lager, such as Pilsner Urquell. The waters of Burton in England contain gypsum, which benefits making pale ale to such a degree that brewers of pale ales will add gypsum to the local water in a process known as Burtonisation.

;Starch source

The starch source in a beer provides the fermentable material and is a key determinant of the strength and flavour of the beer. The most common starch source used in beer is malted grain. Grain is malted by soaking it in water, allowing it to begin germination, and then drying the partially germinated grain in a kiln. Malting grain produces enzymes that will allow conversion from starches in the grain into fermentable sugars during the mash process. Different roasting times and temperatures are used to produce different colours of malt from the same grain. Darker malts will produce darker beers.

Nearly all beer includes barley malt as the majority of the starch. This is because of its fibrous husk, which is important not only in the sparging stage of brewing (in which water is washed over the mashed barley grains to form the wort) but also as a rich source of amylase, a digestive enzyme that facilitates conversion of starch into sugars. Other malted and unmalted grains (including wheat, rice, oats, and rye, and, less frequently, maize (corn) and sorghum) may be used. In recent years, a few brewers have produced gluten-free beer made with sorghum with no barley malt for people who cannot digest gluten-containing grains like wheat, barley, and rye.

;Hops

Hops are the female flower clusters or seed cones of the hop vine &quot;Humulus lupulus&quot;, which are used as a flavouring and preservative agent in nearly all beer made today. Hops had been used for medicinal and food flavouring purposes since Roman times; by the 7th century in Carolingian monasteries in what is now Germany, beer was being made with hops, though it isn&#x27;t until the thirteenth century that widespread cultivation of hops for use in beer is recorded. Before the thirteenth century, beer was flavoured with plants such as yarrow, wild rosemary, and bog myrtle, and other ingredients such as juniper berries, aniseed and ginger, which would be combined into a mixture known as gruit and used as hops are now used; between the thirteenth and the sixteenth century, during which hops took over as the dominant flavouring, beer flavoured with gruit was known as ale, while beer flavoured with hops was known as beer. Some beers today, such as &quot;Fraoch&quot; by the Scottish Heather Ales company and &quot;Cervoise Lancelot&quot; by the French Brasserie-Lancelot company, use plants other than hops for flavouring.

Hops contain several characteristics that brewers desire in beer: they contribute a bitterness that balances the sweetness of the malt; they provide floral, citrus, and herbal aromas and flavours; they have an antibiotic effect that favours the activity of brewer&#x27;s yeast over less desirable microorganisms; and they aid in &quot;head retention&quot;, the length of time that the foam on top of the beer (the beer head) will last. The preservative in hops comes from the lupulin glands which contain soft resins with alpha and beta acids. Though much studied, the preservative nature of the soft resins is not yet fully understood, though it has been observed that unless stored at a cool temperature, the preservative nature will decrease. Brewing is the sole major commercial use of hops.

;Yeast

Yeast is the microorganism that is responsible for fermentation in beer. Yeast metabolises the sugars extracted from grains, which produces alcohol and carbon dioxide, and thereby turns wort into beer. In addition to fermenting the beer, yeast influences the character and flavour.
The dominant types of yeast used to make beer are &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;, known as ale yeast, and &quot;Saccharomyces pastorianus&quot;, known as lager yeast; &quot;Brettanomyces&quot; ferments lambics, and &quot;Torulaspora delbrueckii&quot; ferments Bavarian weissbier. Before the role of yeast in fermentation was understood, fermentation involved wild or airborne yeasts, and a few styles such as lambics still use this method today. Emil Christian Hansen, a Danish biochemist employed by the Carlsberg Laboratory, developed pure yeast cultures which were introduced into the Carlsberg brewery in 1883, and pure yeast strains are now the main fermenting source used worldwide.

;Clarifying agent

Some brewers add one or more clarifying agents to beer, which typically precipitate (collect as a solid) out of the beer along with protein solids and are found only in trace amounts in the finished product. This process makes the beer appear bright and clean, rather than the cloudy appearance of ethnic and older styles of beer such as wheat beers.

Examples of clarifying agents include isinglass, obtained from swim bladders of fish; Irish moss, a seaweed; kappa carrageenan, from the seaweed &quot;kappaphycus&quot;; polyclar (a commercial brand of clarifier); and gelatin. If a beer is marked &quot;suitable for Vegans&quot;, it was generally clarified either with seaweed or with artificial agents, although the &quot;Fast Cask&quot; method invented by Marston&#x27;s in 2009 may provide another method.

==Brewing process==

There are several steps in the brewing process, which may include malting, mashing, lautering, boiling, fermenting, conditioning, filtering, and packaging. The brewing equipment needed to make beer has grown more sophisticated over time, and now covers most aspects of the brewing process.

Malting is the process where barley grain is made ready for brewing. Malting is broken down into three steps in order to help to release the starches in the barley. First, during steeping, the grain is added to a vat with water and allowed to soak for approximately 40 hours. During germination, the grain is spread out on the floor of the germination room for around 5 days. The final part of malting is kilning when the malt goes through a very high temperature drying in a kiln; with gradual temperature increase over several hours. When kilning is complete, the grains are now termed malt, and they will be milled or crushed to break apart the kernels and expose the cotyledon, which contains the majority of the carbohydrates and sugars; this makes it easier to extract the sugars during mashing.

Mashing converts the starches released during the malting stage into sugars that can be fermented. The milled grain is mixed with hot water in a large vessel known as a mash tun. In this vessel, the grain and water are mixed together to create a cereal mash. During the mash, naturally occurring enzymes present in the malt convert the starches (long chain carbohydrates) in the grain into smaller molecules or simple sugars (mono-, di-, and tri-saccharides). This &quot;conversion&quot; is called saccharification which occurs between the temperatures . The result of the mashing process is a sugar-rich liquid or &quot;wort&quot;, which is then strained through the bottom of the mash tun in a process known as lautering. Prior to lautering, the mash temperature may be raised to about (known as a mashout) to free up more starch and reduce mash viscosity. Additional water may be sprinkled on the grains to extract additional sugars (a process known as sparging).

The wort is moved into a large tank known as a &quot;copper&quot; or kettle where it is boiled with hops and sometimes other ingredients such as herbs or sugars. This stage is where many chemical reactions take place, and where important decisions about the flavour, colour, and aroma of the beer are made. The boiling process serves to terminate enzymatic processes, precipitate proteins, isomerize hop resins, and concentrate and sterilize the wort. Hops add flavour, aroma and bitterness to the beer. At the end of the boil, the hopped wort settles to clarify in a vessel called a &quot;whirlpool&quot;, where the more solid particles in the wort are separated out.

After the whirlpool, the wort is drawn away from the compacted hop trub, and rapidly cooled via a heat exchanger to a temperature where yeast can be added. A variety of heat exchanger designs are used in breweries, with the most common a plate-style. Water or glycol run in channels in the opposite direction of the wort, causing a rapid drop in temperature. It is very important to quickly cool the wort to a level where yeast can be added safely as yeast is unable to grow in very high temperatures, and will start to die in temperatures above . After the wort goes through the heat exchanger, the cooled wort goes into a fermentation tank. A type of yeast is selected and added, or &quot;pitched&quot;, to the fermentation tank. When the yeast is added to the wort, the fermenting process begins, where the sugars turn into alcohol, carbon dioxide and other components. When the fermentation is complete the brewer may rack the beer into a new tank, called a conditioning tank. Conditioning of the beer is the process in which the beer ages, the flavour becomes smoother, and flavours that are unwanted dissipate. After conditioning for a week to several months, the beer may be filtered and force carbonated for bottling, or fined in the cask.

==Mashing==

Mashing is the process of combining a mix of milled grain (typically malted barley with supplementary grains such as corn, sorghum, rye or wheat), known as the &quot;grist&quot; or &quot;grain bill&quot;, and water, known as &quot;liquor&quot;, and heating this mixture in a vessel called a &quot;mash tun&quot;. Mashing is a form of steeping, and defines the act of brewing, such as with making tea, sake, and soy sauce. Technically, wine, cider and mead are not brewed but rather vinified, as there is no steeping process involving solids. Mashing allows the enzymes in the malt to break down the starch in the grain into sugars, typically maltose to create a malty liquid called wort. There are two main methods â infusion mashing, in which the grains are heated in one vessel; and decoction mashing, in which a proportion of the grains are boiled and then returned to the mash, raising the temperature. Mashing involves pauses at certain temperatures (notably ), and takes place in a &quot;mash tun&quot; â an insulated brewing vessel with a false bottom. The end product of mashing is called a &quot;mash&quot;.

Mashing usually takes 1 to 2 hours, and during this time the various temperature rests activate different enzymes depending upon the type of malt being used, its modification level, and the intention of the brewer. The activity of these enzymes convert the starches of the grains to dextrins and then to fermentable sugars such as maltose. A mash rest from activates various proteases, which break down proteins that might otherwise cause the beer to be hazy. This rest is generally used only with undermodified (i.e. undermalted) malts which are decreasingly popular in Germany and the Czech Republic, or non-malted grains such as corn and rice, which are widely used in North American beers. A mash rest at activates Î²-glucanase, which breaks down gummy Î²-glucans in the mash, making the sugars flow out more freely later in the process. In the modern mashing process, commercial fungal based Î²-glucanase may be added as a supplement. Finally, a mash rest temperature of is used to convert the starches in the malt to sugar, which is then usable by the yeast later in the brewing process. Doing the latter rest at the lower end of the range favours Î²-amylase enzymes, producing more low-order sugars like maltotriose, maltose, and glucose which are more fermentable by the yeast. This in turn creates a beer lower in body and higher in alcohol. A rest closer to the higher end of the range favours Î±-amylase enzymes, creating more higher-order sugars and dextrins which are less fermentable by the yeast, so a fuller-bodied beer with less alcohol is the result. Duration and pH variances also affect the sugar composition of the resulting wort.

Lautering is the separation of the wort (the liquid containing the sugar extracted during mashing) from the grains. This is done either in a mash tun outfitted with a false bottom, in a lauter tun, or in a mash filter. Most separation processes have two stages: first wort run-off, during which the extract is separated in an undiluted state from the spent grains, and sparging, in which extract which remains with the grains is rinsed off with hot water. The lauter tun is a tank with holes in the bottom small enough to hold back the large bits of grist and hulls (the ground or milled cereal). The bed of grist that settles on it is the actual filter. Some lauter tuns have provision for rotating rakes or knives to cut into the bed of grist to maintain good flow. The knives can be turned so they push the grain, a feature used to drive the spent grain out of the vessel. The mash filter is a plate-and-frame filter. The empty frames contain the mash, including the spent grains, and have a capacity of around one hectoliter. The plates contain a support structure for the filter cloth. The plates, frames, and filter cloths are arranged in a carrier frame like so: frame, cloth, plate, cloth, with plates at each end of the structure. Newer mash filters have bladders that can press the liquid out of the grains between spargings. The grain does not act like a filtration medium in a mash filter.

==Boiling==

After mashing, the beer wort is boiled with hops (and other flavourings if used) in a large tank known as a &quot;copper&quot; or brew kettle â though historically the mash vessel was used and is still in some small breweries. The boiling process is where chemical reactions take place, including sterilization of the wort to remove unwanted bacteria, releasing of hop flavours, bitterness and aroma compounds through isomerization, stopping of enzymatic processes, precipitation of proteins, and concentration of the wort. Finally, the vapours produced during the boil volatilise off-flavours, including dimethyl sulfide precursors. The boil is conducted so that it is even and intense â a continuous &quot;rolling boil&quot;. The boil on average lasts between 45 and 90 minutes, depending on its intensity, the hop addition schedule, and volume of water the brewer expects to evaporate. At the end of the boil, solid particles in the hopped wort are separated out, usually in a vessel called a &quot;whirlpool&quot;.

===Brew kettle or copper===
Copper is the traditional material for the boiling vessel for two main reasons: firstly because copper transfers heat quickly and evenly; secondly because the bubbles produced during boiling, which could act as an insulator against the heat, do not cling to the surface of copper, so the wort is heated in a consistent manner. The simplest boil kettles are direct-fired, with a burner underneath. These can produce a vigorous and favourable boil, but are also apt to scorch the wort where the flame touches the kettle, causing caramelisation and making cleanup difficult. Most breweries use a steam-fired kettle, which uses steam jackets in the kettle to boil the wort. Breweries usually have a boiling unit either inside or outside of the kettle, usually a tall, thin cylinder with vertical tubes, called a calandria, through which wort is pumped.

===Whirlpool===

At the end of the boil, solid particles in the hopped wort are separated out, usually in a vessel called a &quot;whirlpool&quot; or &quot;settling tank&quot;. The whirlpool was devised by Henry Ranulph Hudston while working for the Molson Brewery in 1960 to utilise the so-called tea leaf paradox to force the denser solids known as &quot;trub&quot; (coagulated proteins, vegetable matter from hops) into a cone in the centre of the whirlpool tank. Whirlpool systems vary: smaller breweries tend to use the brew kettle, larger breweries use a separate tank, and design will differ, with tank floors either flat, sloped, conical or with a cup in the centre. The principle in all is that by swirling the wort the centripetal force will push the trub into a cone at the centre of the bottom of the tank, where it can be easily removed.

===Hopback===

A hopback is a traditional additional chamber that acts as a sieve or filter by using whole hops to clear debris (or &quot;trub&quot;) from the unfermented (or &quot;green&quot;) wort, as the whirlpool does, and also to increase hop aroma in the finished beer. It is a chamber between the brewing kettle and wort chiller. Hops are added to the chamber, the hot wort from the kettle is run through it, and then immediately cooled in the wort chiller before entering the fermentation chamber. Hopbacks utilizing a sealed chamber facilitate maximum retention of volatile hop aroma compounds that would normally be driven off when the hops contact the hot wort. While a hopback has a similar filtering effect as a whirlpool, it operates differently: a whirlpool uses centrifugal forces, a hopback uses a layer of whole hops to act as a filter bed. Furthermore, while a whirlpool is useful only for the removal of pelleted hops (as flowers do not tend to separate as easily), in general hopbacks are used only for the removal of whole flower hops (as the particles left by pellets tend to make it through the hopback). The hopback has mainly been substituted in modern breweries by the whirlpool.

===Wort cooling===
After the whirlpool, the wort must be brought down to fermentation temperatures before yeast is added. In modern breweries this is achieved through a plate heat exchanger. A plate heat exchanger has sereral ridged plates, which form two separate paths. The wort is pumped into the heat exchanger, and goes through every other gap between the plates. The cooling medium, usually water from a cold liquor tank, goes through the other gaps. The ridges in the plates ensure turbulent flow. A good heat exchanger can drop wort to while warming the cooling medium from about to . The last few plates often use a cooling medium which can be cooled to below the freezing point, which allows a finer control over the wort-out temperature, and also enables cooling to around . After cooling, oxygen is often dissolved into the wort to revitalize the yeast and aid its reproduction. 

While boiling, it is useful to recover some of the energy used to boil the wort. On its way out of the brewery, the steam created during the boil is passed over a coil through which unheated water flows. By adjusting the rate of flow, the output temperature of the water can be controlled. This is also often done using a plate heat exchanger. The water is then stored for later use in the next mash, in equipment cleaning, or wherever necessary. Another common method of energy recovery takes place during the wort cooling. When cold water is used to cool the wort in a heat exchanger, the water is significantly warmed. In an efficient brewery, cold water is passed through the heat exchanger at a rate set to maximize the water&#x27;s temperature upon exiting. This now-hot water is then stored in a hot water tank.

==Fermenting ==
Fermentation takes place in fermentation vessels which come in various forms, from enormous cylindroconical vessels, through open stone vessels, to wooden vats. After the wort is cooled and aerated â usually with sterile air â yeast is added to it, and it begins to ferment. It is during this stage that sugars won from the malt are converted into alcohol and carbon dioxide, and the product can be called beer for the first time.

Most breweries today use cylindroconical vessels, or CCVs, which have a conical bottom and a cylindrical top. The cone&#x27;s angle is typically around 60Â°, an angle that will allow the yeast to flow towards the cone&#x27;s apex, but is not so steep as to take up too much vertical space. CCVs can handle both fermenting and conditioning in the same tank. At the end of fermentation, the yeast and other solids which have fallen to the cone&#x27;s apex can be simply flushed out of a port at the apex. Open fermentation vessels are also used, often for show in brewpubs, and in Europe in wheat beer fermentation. These vessels have no tops, which makes harvesting top-fermenting yeasts very easy. The open tops of the vessels make the risk of infection greater, but with proper cleaning procedures and careful protocol about who enters fermentation chambers, the risk can be well controlled. Fermentation tanks are typically made of stainless steel. If they are simple cylindrical tanks with beveled ends, they are arranged vertically, as opposed to conditioning tanks which are usually laid out horizontally. Only a very few breweries still use wooden vats for fermentation as wood is difficult to keep clean and infection-free and must be repitched more or less yearly.

===Fermentation methods===

There are three main fermentation methods, warm, cool, and wild or spontaneous. Fermentation may take place in open or closed vessels. There may be a secondary fermentation which can take place in the brewery, in the cask or in the bottle.

Brewing yeasts are traditionally classed as &quot;top-cropping&quot; (or &quot;top-fermenting&quot;) and &quot;bottom-cropping&quot; (or &quot;bottom-fermenting&quot;); the yeasts classed as top-fermenting are generally used in warm fermentations, where they ferment quickly, and the yeasts classed as bottom-fermenting are used in cooler fermentations where they ferment more slowly. Yeast were termed top or bottom cropping, because the yeast was collected from the top or bottom of the fermenting wort to be reused for the next brew. This terminology is somewhat inappropriate in the modern era; after the widespread application of brewing mycology it was discovered that the two separate collecting methods involved two different yeast species that favoured different temperature regimes, namely &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; in top-cropping at warmer temperatures and &quot;Saccharomyces pastorianus&quot; in bottom-cropping at cooler temperatures. As brewing methods changed in the 20th century, cylindro-conical fermenting vessels became the norm and the collection of yeast for both &quot;Saccharomyces&quot; species is done from the bottom of the fermenter. Thus the method of collection no longer implies a species association. There are a few remaining breweries who collect yeast in the top-cropping method, such as Samuel Smiths brewery in Yorkshire, Marstons in Staffordshire and several German hefeweizen producers.

For both types, yeast is fully distributed through the beer while it is fermenting, and both equally flocculate (clump together and precipitate to the bottom of the vessel) when fermentation is finished. By no means do all top-cropping yeasts demonstrate this behaviour, but it features strongly in many English yeasts that may also exhibit chain forming (the failure of budded cells to break from the mother cell), which is in the technical sense different from true flocculation. The most common top-cropping brewer&#x27;s yeast, &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;, is the same species as the common baking yeast. However, baking and brewing yeasts typically belong to different strains, cultivated to favour different characteristics: baking yeast strains are more aggressive, in order to carbonate dough in the shortest amount of time; brewing yeast strains act slower, but tend to tolerate higher alcohol concentrations (normally 12â15% abv is the maximum, though under special treatment some ethanol-tolerant strains can be coaxed up to around 20%). Modern quantitative genomics has revealed the complexity of &quot;Saccharomyces&quot; species to the extent that yeasts involved in beer and wine production commonly involve hybrids of so-called pure species. As such, the yeasts involved in what has been typically called top-cropping or top-fermenting ale may be both &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; and complex hybrids of &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; and &quot;Saccharomyces kudriavzevii&quot;. Three notable ales, Chimay, Orval and Westmalle, are fermented with these hybrid strains, which are identical to wine yeasts from Switzerland.

====Warm fermentation====

In general, yeasts such as &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; are fermented at warm temperatures between , occasionally as high as , while the yeast used by Brasserie Dupont for saison ferments even higher at . They generally form a foam on the surface of the fermenting beer, which is called barm, as during the fermentation process its hydrophobic surface causes the flocs to adhere to CO2 and rise; because of this, they are often referred to as &quot;top-cropping&quot; or &quot;top-fermenting&quot; â though this distinction is less clear in modern brewing with the use of cylindro-conical tanks. Generally, warm-fermented beers, which are usually termed ale, are ready to drink within three weeks after the beginning of fermentation, although some brewers will condition or mature them for several months.

====Cool fermentation====

When a beer has been brewed using a cool fermentation of around , compared to typical warm fermentation temperatures of , then stored (or lagered) for typically several weeks (or months) at temperatures close to freezing point, it is termed a &quot;lager&quot;. During the lagering or storage phase several flavour components developed during fermentation dissipate, resulting in a &quot;cleaner&quot; flavour. Though it is the slow, cool fermentation and cold conditioning (or lagering) that defines the character of lager, the main technical difference is with the yeast generally used, which is &quot;Saccharomyces pastorianus&quot;. Technical differences include the ability of lager yeast to metabolize melibiose, and the tendency to settle at the bottom of the fermenter (though ale yeasts can also become bottom settling by selection); though these technical differences are not considered by scientists to be influential in the character or flavour of the finished beer, brewers feel otherwise â sometimes cultivating their own yeast strains which may suit their brewing equipment or for a particular purpose, such as brewing beers with a high abv.

Brewers in Bavaria had for centuries been selecting cold-fermenting yeasts by storing (&quot;lagern&quot;) their beers in cold alpine caves. The process of natural selection meant that the wild yeasts that were most cold tolerant would be the ones that would remain actively fermenting 
in the beer that was stored in the caves. A sample of these Bavarian yeasts was sent from the Spaten brewery in Munich to the Carlsberg brewery in Copenhagen in 1845 who began brewing with it. In 1883 Emile Hansen completed a study on pure yeast culture isolation and the pure strain obtained from Spaten went into industrial production in 1884 as Carlsberg yeast No 1. Another specialized pure yeast production plant was installed at the Heineken Brewery in Rotterdam the following year and together they began the supply of pure cultured yeast to brewers across Europe. This yeast strain was originally classified as &quot;Saccharomyces carlsbergensis&quot;, a now defunct species name which has been superseded by the currently accepted taxonomic classification &quot;Saccharomyces pastorianus&quot;.

====Spontaneous fermentation====
Lambic beers are historically brewed in Brussels and the nearby Pajottenland region of Belgium without any yeast inoculation. The wort is cooled in open vats (called &quot;coolships&quot;), where the yeasts and microbiota present in the brewery (such as &quot;Brettanomyces&quot;) are allowed to settle to create a spontaneous fermentation, and are then conditioned or matured in oak barrels for typically one to three years.

==Conditioning==
After an initial or primary fermentation, beer is &quot;conditioned&quot;, matured or aged, in one of several ways, which can take from 2 to 4 weeks, several months, or several years, depending on the brewer&#x27;s intention for the beer. The beer is usually transferred into a second container, so that it is no longer exposed to the dead yeast and other debris (also known as &quot;trub&quot;) that have settled to the bottom of the primary fermenter. This prevents the formation of unwanted flavours and harmful compounds such as acetaldehyde.

;KrÃ¤usening
KrÃ¤usening (pronounced ) is a conditioning method in which fermenting wort is added to the finished beer. The active yeast will restart fermentation in the finished beer, and so introduce fresh carbon dioxide; the conditioning tank will be then sealed so that the carbon dioxide is dissolved into the beer producing a lively &quot;condition&quot; or level of carbonation. The krÃ¤usening method may also be used to condition bottled beer.

;Lagering
Lagers are stored at cellar temperature or below for 1â6 months while still on the yeast. The process of storing, or conditioning, or maturing, or aging a beer at a low temperature for a long period is called &quot;lagering&quot;, and while it is associated with lagers, the process may also be done with ales, with the same result â that of cleaning up various chemicals, acids and compounds.

;Secondary fermentation
During secondary fermentation, most of the remaining yeast will settle to the bottom of the second fermenter, yielding a less hazy product.

;Bottle fermentation
Some beers undergo an additional fermentation in the bottle giving natural carbonation. This may be a second and/or third fermentation. They are bottled with a viable yeast population in suspension. If there is no residual fermentable sugar left, sugar or wort or both may be added in a process known as priming. The resulting fermentation generates CO2 that is trapped in the bottle, remaining in solution and providing natural carbonation. Bottle-conditioned beers may be either filled unfiltered direct from the fermentation or conditioning tank, or filtered and then reseeded with yeast.

;Cask conditioning
Cask ale (or cask-conditioned beer) is unfiltered, unpasteurised beer that is conditioned by a secondary fermentation in a metal, plastic or wooden cask. It is dispensed from the cask by being either poured from a tap by gravity, or pumped up from a cellar via a beer engine (hand pump). Sometimes a cask breather is used to keep the beer fresh by allowing carbon dioxide to replace oxygen as the beer is drawn off the cask. Until 2018, the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) defined real ale as beer &quot;served without the use of extraneous carbon dioxide&quot;, which would disallow the use of a cask breather, a policy which was reversed in April 2018 to allow beer served with the use of cask breathers to meet its definition of real ale.

;Barrel-ageing
Barrel-ageing (US: Barrel aging) is the process of ageing beer in wooden barrels to achieve a variety of effects in the final product. Sour beers such as lambics are fully fermented in wood, while other beers are aged in barrels which were previously used for maturing wines or spirits. In 2016 &quot;Craft Beer and Brewing&quot; wrote: &quot;Barrel-aged beers are so trendy that nearly every taphouse and beer store has a section of them.

==Filtering==

Filtering stabilises the flavour of beer, holding it at a point acceptable to the brewer, and preventing further development from the yeast, which under poor conditions can release negative components and flavours. Filtering also removes haze, clearing the beer, and so giving it a &quot;polished shine and brilliance&quot;. Beer with a clear appearance has been commercially desirable for brewers since the development of glass vessels for storing and drinking beer, along with the commercial success of pale lager, which â due to the lagering process in which haze and particles settle to the bottom of the tank and so the beer &quot;drops bright&quot; (clears) â has a natural bright appearance and shine. 

There are several forms of filters; they may be in the form of sheets or &quot;candles&quot;, or they may be a fine powder such as diatomaceous earth (also called kieselguhr), which is added to the beer to form a filtration bed which allows liquid to pass, but holds onto suspended particles such as yeast. Filters range from rough filters that remove much of the yeast and any solids (e.g., hops, grain particles) left in the beer, to filters tight enough to strain colour and body from the beer. Filtration ratings are divided into rough, fine, and sterile. Rough filtration leaves some cloudiness in the beer, but it is noticeably clearer than unfiltered beer. Fine filtration removes almost all cloudiness. Sterile filtration removes almost all microorganisms.

;Sheet (pad) filters
These filters use sheets that allow only particles smaller than a given size to pass through. The sheets are placed into a filtering frame, sanitized (with boiling water, for example) and then used to filter the beer. The sheets can be flushed if the filter becomes blocked. The sheets are usually disposable and are replaced between filtration sessions. Often the sheets contain powdered filtration media to aid in filtration.

Pre-made filters have two sides. One with loose holes, and the other with tight holes. Flow goes from the side with loose holes to the side with the tight holes, with the intent that large particles get stuck in the large holes while leaving enough room around the particles and filter medium for smaller particles to go through and get stuck in tighter holes.

Sheets are sold in nominal ratings, and typically 90% of particles larger than the nominal rating are caught by the sheet.
;Kieselguhr filters

Filters that use a powder medium are considerably more complicated to operate, but can filter much more beer before regeneration. Common media include diatomaceous earth and perlite.

==By-products==

Brewing by-products are &quot;spent grain&quot; and the sediment (or &quot;dregs&quot;) from the filtration process which may be dried and resold as &quot;brewers dried yeast&quot; for poultry feed, or made into yeast extract which is used in brands such as Vegemite and Marmite. The process of turning the yeast sediment into edible yeast extract was discovered by German scientist Justus von Liebig.

Brewer&#x27;s spent grain (also called spent grain, brewer&#x27;s grain or draff) is the main by-product of the brewing process; it consists of the residue of malt and grain which remains in the lauter tun after the lautering process. It consists primarily of grain husks, pericarp, and fragments of endosperm. As it mainly consists of carbohydrates and proteins, and is readily consumed by animals, spent grain is used in animal feed. Spent grains can also be used as fertilizer, whole grains in bread, as well as in the production of flour and biogas. Spent grain is also an ideal medium for growing mushrooms, such as shiitake, and some breweries are already either growing their own mushrooms or supplying spent grain to mushroom farms. Spent grains can be used in the production of red bricks, to improve the open porosity and reduce thermal conductivity of the ceramic mass.

==Brewing industry==

The brewing industry is a global business, consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of other producers known as microbreweries or regional breweries or craft breweries depending on size, region, and marketing preference. More than are sold per yearâproducing total global revenues of $294.5 billion (Â£147.7 billion) as of 2006. SABMiller became the largest brewing company in the world when it acquired Royal Grolsch, brewer of Dutch premium beer brand Grolsch. InBev was the second-largest beer-producing company in the world and Anheuser-Busch held the third spot, but after the acquisition of Anheuser-Busch by InBev, the new Anheuser-Busch InBev company is currently the largest brewer in the world.

Brewing at home is subject to regulation and prohibition in many countries. Restrictions on homebrewing were lifted in the UK in 1963, Australia followed suit in 1972, and the US in 1978, though individual states were allowed to pass their own laws limiting production.

<doc id="4419" wikidata="Q994507" url="?curid=4419" title="Breast reconstruction">
<text>Breast reconstruction is the surgical process of rebuilding the shape and look of a breast, most commonly in women who have had surgery to treat breast cancer. It involves using autologous tissue, prosthetic implants, or a combination of both with the goal of reconstructing a natural-looking breast. This process often also includes the rebuilding of the nipple and areola, known as nipple-areola complex (NAC) reconstruction, as one of the final stages.

Generally, the aesthetic appearance is acceptable to the woman, but the reconstructed area is commonly completely numb afterwards, which results in loss of sexual function as well as the ability to perceive pain caused by burns and other injuries.

== Timing ==
Breast reconstruction can be performed either immediately following the mastectomy or as a separate procedure at a later date, known as immediate reconstruction and delayed reconstruction, respectively. The decision of when breast reconstruction will take place is patient-specific and based on many different factors. Breast reconstruction is a large undertaking that usually requires multiple operations. These subsequent surgeries may be spread out over weeks or months.

=== Immediate reconstruction ===
Breast reconstruction is termed &quot;immediate&quot; when it takes place during the same procedure as the mastectomy. Within the United States, approximately 35% of women who have undergone a total mastectomy for breast cancer will choose to pursue immediate breast reconstruction. One of the inherent advantages of immediate reconstruction is the potential for a single-stage procedure. This also means that the cost of immediate reconstruction is often far less to the patient. It can also reduce hospital costs by having fewer procedures and requiring a shorter length of the stay as an inpatient. Additionally, immediate reconstruction often has a better cosmetic result because of the preservation of anatomic landmarks and skin. With regards to psychosocial outcomes, opinions on timing have shifted in favor of immediate reconstruction. Originally, delayed reconstruction was believed to provide patients with time to psychologically adjust to the mastectomy and its effects on body image. However, this opinion is no longer widely held. Compared to delayed procedures, immediate reconstruction can have a more positive psychological impact on patients and their self-esteem, most likely due to the post-operative breast more closely resembling the natural breast compared to the defect left by mastectomy alone.

=== Delayed reconstruction ===
Delayed breast reconstruction is considered more challenging than immediate reconstruction. Frequently not just breast volume, but also skin surface area needs to be restored. Many patients undergoing delayed breast reconstruction have been previously treated with radiation or have had a reconstruction failure with immediate breast reconstruction. In nearly all cases of delayed breast reconstruction tissue must be borrowed from another part of the body to make the new breast. Patients expected to receive radiation therapy as part of their adjuvant treatment are also commonly considered for delayed autologous reconstruction due to significantly higher complication rates with tissue expander-implant techniques in those patients. While waiting to begin breast reconstruction until several months after radiation therapy may decrease the risk of complications, this risk will always be higher in patients who have received radiation therapy. As with many other surgeries, patients with significant medical comorbidities (e.g., high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes) and smokers are higher-risk candidates. Surgeons may choose to perform delayed reconstruction to decrease this risk.

==Techniques==
There are several techniques for breast reconstruction. These options are broadly categorized into two different groups:

=== Implant-based reconstruction ===
This is the most common technique used worldwide. Implant-based reconstruction is an option for patients who have sufficient skin after mastectomy to cover a prosthetic implant and allow for a natural shape. For women undergoing bilateral mastectomies, implants provide the greatest opportunity for symmetrical shape and lift. Additionally, these procedures are generally much faster than flap-based reconstruction since tissue does not have to be taken from another part of the patient&#x27;s body.

Implant-based reconstruction may be one- or two-staged. In one-stage reconstruction, a permanent implant is inserted at the time of mastectomy. During two-stage reconstruction, the surgeon will insert a tissue expander underneath the pectoralis major muscle of the chest wall at the time of mastectomy. This temporary silastic implant is used to hold tension on the mastectomy flaps. In doing so, the tissue expander prevents the breast tissue from contracting and allows for use of a larger implant later on compared to what would be safe at the time of the mastectomy. Following this initial procedure, the patient must return to the clinic on multiple occasions for saline to be injected into a tube inside the tissue expander. By doing this slowly over the course of several weeks, the space beneath the pectoralis major muscle is safely expanded to an appropriate size without causing too much stress on the breast tissue. A second procedure is then necessary to remove the tissue expander and replace it with the final, permanent prosthetic implant.

Although in the past, prosthetic implants were placed directly under the skin, this method has fallen out of favor because of the greater risk of complications, including visible rippling of the implant and capsular contracture. The sub-pectoral technique described above is now preferred because it provides an additional muscular layer between the skin and the implant, decreasing the risk of visible deformity. Oftentimes, however, the pectoralis major muscle is not sufficiently large enough to cover the inferior portion of the prosthetic implant. If this is the case, one option is to use an acellular dermal matrix to cover the exposed portion of the prosthetic implant, improving both functional and aesthetic outcomes. This prepectoral space has recently, however, come back into practice, with comparable rates of post-operative complications and implant loss to submuscular placement. Both delayed and direct-to-implant reconstruction in this plane has been shown to be favourable.

Of note, a Cochrane review published in 2016 concluded that implants for use in breast reconstructive surgery have not been adequately studied in good quality clinical trials. &quot;These days - even after a few million women have had breasts reconstructed â surgeons cannot inform women about the risks and complications of different implant-based breast reconstructive options on the basis of results derived from Randomized Controlled Trials.&quot;

=== Flap-based reconstruction ===
Flap-based reconstruction uses tissue from other parts of the patient&#x27;s body (i.e., autologous tissue) such as the back, buttocks, thigh or abdomen. In surgery, a &quot;flap&quot; is any type of tissue that is lifted from a donor site and moved to a recipient site using its own blood supply. Usually, the blood supply is a named vessel. Flap-based reconstruction may be performed either by leaving the donor tissue connected to the original site (also known as a pedicle flap) to retain its blood supply (where the vessels are tunneled beneath the skin surface to the new site) or by cutting the donor tissue&#x27;s vessels and surgically reconnecting them to a new blood supply at the recipient site (also known as a free flap or free tissue transfer). The latissimus dorsi is a prime example of such a flap since it can remain attached to its primary blood source which preserves the skins functioning, and is associated with better outcomes in comparison to other muscle and skin donor sites. Â 

One option for breast reconstruction involves using the latissimus dorsi muscle as the donor tissue. As a back muscle, the latissimus dorsi is large and flat and can be used without significant loss of function. It can be moved into the breast defect while still attached to its blood supply under the arm pit (axilla). A latissimus flap is often used to recruit soft-tissue coverage over an underlying implant; however, if the latissimus flap can provide enough volume, then occasionally it is used to reconstruct small breasts without the need for an implant. The latissimus dorsi flap has a number of advantages, but despite the advances in surgical techniques, it has remained vulnerable to skin dehiscence or necrosis at the donor site (on the back). The Mannu flap is a form of latissimus dorsi flap which avoids this complication by preserving a generous subcutaneous fat layer at the donor site and has been shown to be a safe, simple and effective way of avoiding wound dehiscence at the donor site after extended latissimus dorsi flap reconstruction.

Another possible donor site for breast reconstruction is the abdomen. The TRAM (transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous) flap or its technically distinct variants of microvascular &quot;perforator flaps&quot; like the DIEP/SIEA flaps are all commonly used. In a TRAM procedure, a portion of the abdominal tissue, which includes skin, subcutaneous fat, minor muscles, and connective tissues, is taken from the patient&#x27;s abdomen and transplanted to the breast site. Both TRAM and DIEP/SIEA use the abdominal tissue between the umbilicus (or &quot;belly button&quot;) and the pubis. The DIEP flap and free-TRAM flap require advanced microsurgical technique and are less common as a result. Both can provide enough tissue to reconstruct large breasts and are a good option for patients who would prefer to maintain their pre-operative breast volume. These procedures are preferred by some breast cancer patients because removal of the donor site tissue results in an abdominoplasty (tummy tuck) and allow the breast to be reconstructed with one&#x27;s own tissues instead of a prosthetic implant that uses foreign material. That said, TRAM flap procedures can potentially weaken the abdominal wall and torso strength, but they are generally well tolerated by most patients. Perforator techniques such as the DIEP (deep inferior epigastric perforator) flap and SIEA (superficial inferior epigastric artery) flap require precise dissection of small perforating vessels through the rectus muscle and, thus, do not require removal of abdominal muscle. Because of this, these flaps have the advantage of maintaining the majority of abdominal wall strength.

Other donor sites for autologous breast reconstruction include the buttocks, which provides tissue for the SGAP and IGAP (superior and inferior gluteal artery perforator, respectively) flaps. The purpose of perforator flaps (DIEP, SIEA, SGAP, IGAP) is to provide sufficient skin and fat for an aesthetic reconstruction while minimizing post-operative complications from harvesting the underlying muscles. DIEP reconstruction generally produces the best outcome for most women. See free flap breast reconstruction for more information.

Mold-assisted reconstruction is a potential adjunctive process to help in flap-based reconstruction. By using a laser and 3D printer, a patient-specific silicone mold can be used as an aid during surgery, used as a guide for orienting and shaping the flap to improve accuracy and symmetry.

==Adjunctive procedures==
To restore the appearance of the pre-operative breast, there are a few options regarding the nipple-areolar complex (NAC):
* A nipple prosthesis can be used to restore the appearance of the reconstructed breast. Impressions can be made and photographs can be used to accurately replace the nipple lost with some types of mastectomies. This can be instrumental in restoring the psychological well-being of the breast cancer survivor. The same process can be used to replicate the remaining nipple in cases of a single mastectomy. Ideally, a prosthesis is made around the time of the mastectomy and it can be used just weeks after the surgery.
* Nipple-areolar complex reconstruction can also be performed surgically. Within the first year following breast reconstruction, flaps can undergo contraction and decrease in size by up to 50%. Although flaps are made larger initially for this reason, it is hard to accurately predict the final breast volume. Because of this, NAC reconstruction is considered the very last stage of breast reconstruction, delayed until after breast mound reconstruction is completed (including additional procedures such as fat grafting or excess tissue removal) so that the positioning of the NAC can be planned precisely. There are several methods of reconstructing the nipple-areolar complex:
** Nipple grafting (nipple sharing): If a patient undergoes a single mastectomy with reconstruction and the opposite breast is preserved, then one option is to remove part of the preserved nipple and transfer it to the reconstructed breast. This also requires that the patient has sufficient nipple-areolar tissue to be removed as nipple grafting will decrease the native nipple&#x27;s projection by about 50%. One of the benefits of this procedure is that the color and texture of the NAC is identical to that of the opposite breast.
** Local tissue flaps: For patients who have undergone bilateral mastectomies (as well as patients receiving a unilateral mastectomy who do not want to pursue nipple grafting), a nipple can be created by raising a small, local flap in the target area and producing a raised mound of skin very similar in shape to a nipple. To create an areola, a circular incision may be made around the new nipple and sutured back again. While this option does produce the shape and outline of the NAC, it does not affect the skin color. To make it appear more natural, the nipple and areolar region may then be tattooed to produce a darker skin color more similar to a natural nipple and areola.
** Local tissue flaps, with acellular dermis graft: As above, a nipple may be created by raising a small flap in the target area and producing a raised mound of skin. A graft of acellular dermis (such as cadaver-derived material) can then be inserted into the core of the new nipple acting as a support which may help maintain the projection of the nipple for a longer time.
*The nipple and areolar region may be tattooed later. There are, however, some important issues in relation to NAC tattooing that should be considered prior to opting for tattooing, such as the choice of pigments and equipment used for the procedure.

When looking at the entire process of breast reconstruction, patients typically report that NAC reconstruction is the least satisfying step. Compared to a normal nipple, the reconstructed nipple often has less projection (how far the nipple extends beyond the breast mound) and lacks sensation. In women who have undergone a single mastectomy with reconstruction, another challenge is aesthetically matching the reconstructed NAC to the native breast.

==Outcomes==
The typical outcome of breast reconstruction surgery is a breast mound with a pleasing aesthetic shape, with a texture similar to a natural breast, but which feels completely or mostly numb for the woman herself. This loss of sensation, called &quot;somatosensory loss&quot; or the inability to perceive touch, heat, cold, and pain, sometimes results in women burning themselves or injuring themselves without noticing, or not noticing that their clothing has shifted to expose their breasts. &quot;I can&#x27;t even feel it when my kids hug me,&quot; said one mother, who had nipple-sparing breast reconstruction after a bilateral mastectomy. The loss of sensation has long-term medical consequences, because it makes the affected women unable to feel itchy rashes, infected sores, cuts, bruises, or situations that risk sunburns or frostbite on the affected areas.

More than half of women treated for breast cancer develop upper quarter dysfunction, including limits on how well they can move, pain in the breast, shoulder or arm, lymphedema, loss of sensation, and impaired strength. The risk of dysfunction is higher among women who have breast reconstruction surgery. One in three have complications, one in five need further surgery and the procedure fails in 5%.

Some methods have specific side effects. The transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM) flap method results in weakness and loss of flexibility in the abdominal wall. Reconstruction with implants have a higher risk of long-term pain.

Outcomes-based research on quality of life improvements and psychosocial benefits associated with breast reconstruction served as the stimulus in the United States for the 1998 Women&#x27;s Health and Cancer Rights Act, which mandated that health care payer cover breast and nipple reconstruction, contralateral procedures to achieve symmetry, and treatment for the sequelae of mastectomy. This was followed in 2001 by additional legislation imposing penalties on noncompliant insurers. Similar provisions for coverage exist in most countries worldwide through national health care programs.

<text>The Brooklyn Historic Railway Association (BHRA) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization with a shop, trolley barn and offices located in Red Hook, Brooklyn, New York, on the historic Beard Street Piers (c. 1870). BHRA had a fleet of 16 trolleys (15 PCC trolleys and a leased 1897 trolley car from the Oslo Trams, in Oslo, Norway).

== History of project ==
The BHRA&#x27;s origin began with the rediscovery of the Cobble Hill Tunnel by the late Bob Diamond in 1980. BHRA was formed in 1982 to restore the historic tunnel. The Atlantic Avenue Tunnel (constructed in 1844) is the world&#x27;s oldest subway tunnel. BHRA successfully filed and received designation for the tunnel on the National Register of Historic Places.

The BHRA received funding and permission from the city to construct a light rail route in Red Hook. However, the project was hampered due to the New York City Department of Transportation (DOT) withdrawing its support from the project. The DOT identified several potential improvements which did not include a streetcar, however, that would improve access and mobility for neighborhood residents. Construction was stopped on a 7-block extension to the line due to the removal and scrapping of rails, ties, and other items of railroad equipment by the DOT, which were stored on land that was slated for the Fairway supermarket project.

On June 30, 2003, BHRA was ordered to remove and fill in all trolley tracks on public streets by the DOT. The DOT revoked consent for the project to proceed or exist on city streets. Shortly thereafter, BHRA completely ceased operation. All the PCC trolleys except for No. 3303 were removed from Brooklyn.
The BHRA ran organized tours of the Cobble Hill Tunnel from time to time, but all tours are currently suspended.

Bob Diamond died on 21 August 2021, with his death confirmed by articles in &quot;the New York Times&quot;, &quot;New York Daily News&quot; and &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot; newspapers.

<doc id="4427" wikidata="Q41873" url="?curid=4427" title="Î-Lactam">
<text>A Î²-lactam (&quot;beta-&quot;lactam) ring is a four-membered lactam. A &quot;lactam&quot; is a cyclic amide, and &quot;beta&quot;-lactams are named so because the nitrogen atom is attached to the Î²-carbon atom relative to the carbonyl. The simplest Î²-lactam possible is 2-azetidinone. Î²-lactams are significant structural units of medicines as manifested in many Î²-lactam antibiotics. Up to 1970, most Î²-lactam research was concerned with the penicillin and cephalosporin groups, but since then, a wide variety of structures have been described.

==Clinical significance==
The Î²-lactam ring is part of the core structure of several antibiotic families, the principal ones being the penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, and monobactams, which are, therefore, also called Î²-lactam antibiotics. Nearly all of these antibiotics work by inhibiting bacterial cell wall biosynthesis. This has a lethal effect on bacteria, although any given bacteria population will typically contain a subgroup that is resistant to Î²-lactam antibiotics. Bacterial resistance occurs as a result of the expression of one of many genes for the production of Î²-lactamases, a class of enzymes that break open the Î²-lactam ring. More than 1,800 different Î²-lactamase enzymes have been documented in various species of bacteria. These enzymes vary widely in their chemical structure and catalytic efficiencies. When bacterial populations have these resistant subgroups, treatment with Î²-lactam can result in the resistant strain becoming more prevalent and therefore more virulent. Î²-lactam derived antibiotics can be considered one of the most important antibiotic classes but prone to clinical resistance. Î²-lactam exhibits its antibiotic properties by imitating the naturally occurring d-Ala-d-Ala substrate for the group of enzymes known as penicillin binding proteins (PBP), which have as function to cross-link the peptidoglycan part of the cell wall of the bacteria.

The Î²-lactam ring is also found in some other drugs such as the cholesterol absorption inhibitor drug ezetimibe.

==Synthesis==
The first synthetic Î²-lactam was prepared by Hermann Staudinger in 1907 by reaction of the Schiff base of aniline and benzaldehyde with diphenylketene in a [2+2] cycloaddition (Ph indicates a phenyl functional group):

Many methods have been developed for the synthesis of Î²-lactams.

The Breckpot Î²-lactam synthesis produces substituted Î²-lactams by the cyclization of beta amino acid esters by use of a Grignard reagent. Mukaiyama&#x27;s reagent is also used in modified Breckpot synthesis. 

==Reactions==
Due to ring strain, Î²-lactams are more readily hydrolyzed than linear amides or larger lactams. This strain is further increased by fusion to a second ring, as found in most Î²-lactam antibiotics. This trend is due to the amide character of the Î²-lactam being reduced by the aplanarity of the system. The nitrogen atom of an ideal amide is sp2-hybridized due to resonance, and sp2-hybridized atoms have trigonal planar bond geometry. As a pyramidal bond geometry is forced upon the nitrogen atom by the ring strain, the resonance of the amide bond is reduced, and the carbonyl becomes more ketone-like. Nobel laureate Robert Burns Woodward described a parameter &quot;h&quot; as a measure of the height of the trigonal pyramid defined by the nitrogen (as the apex) and its three adjacent atoms. &quot;h&quot; corresponds to the strength of the Î²-lactam bond with lower numbers (more planar; more like ideal amides) being stronger and less reactive. Monobactams have &quot;h&quot; values between 0.05 and 0.10Â angstroms (Ã). Cephems have &quot;h&quot; values in of 0.20â0.25Â Ã. Penams have values in the range 0.40â0.50Â Ã, while carbapenems and clavams have values of 0.50â0.60Â Ã, being the most reactive of the Î²-lactams toward hydrolysis.

<doc id="4429" wikidata="Q182492" url="?curid=4429" title="Prince-Bishopric of Brandenburg">
<text>The Prince-Bishopric of Brandenburg () was an ecclesiastical principality of the Holy Roman Empire from the 12th century until it was secularized during the second half of the 16th century. It should not be confused with the larger Diocese of Brandenburg () established by King Otto I of Germany in 948, in the territory of the &quot;Marca Geronis&quot; (Saxon Eastern March) east of the Elbe river. The diocese, over which the prince-bishop exercised only spiritual authority, was a suffragan diocese of the Archdiocese of Magdeburg, its seat was Brandenburg an der Havel.

==History==
The Prince-Bishopric of Brandenburg was an imperial estate of the Holy Roman Empire for some time, probably starting about 1161/1165. However, the Brandenburg bishops never managed to gain control over a significant territory, being overshadowed by the Margraviate of Brandenburg, which was originally seated in the same city. Chapter and cathedral, surrounded by further ecclesiastical institutions, were located on the &quot;Dominsel&quot; (Cathedral Island), which formed a prince-episcopal cathedral immunity district (&quot;Domfreiheit&quot;), distinct from the city of Brandenburg. Only in 1929 the - meanwhile former - immunity district was incorporated into the city itself.

As rulers of imperial immediacy, regnant in a, however, dispersed territory partitioned into the four bailiwicks () of Brandenburg/Havel, Ketzin, Teltow and Ziesar. The prince-bishops from the early 14th century onwards resided in their fortress in Ziesar on the road to Magdeburg. The last actual bishop was Matthias von Jagow (d. 1544), who took the side of the Protestant Reformation, married, and in every way furthered the undertakings of the Hohenzollern elector Joachim II.

There were two more nominal bishops, but on the petition of the latter of these, the electoral prince John George of Brandenburg appointed in 1560, the secularisation of the bishopric was undertaken and finally accomplished in 1571, in spite of legal proceedings to reassert the imperial immediacy of the prince-bishopric within the Empire and so to likewise preserve the diocese, which dragged on into the 17th century.

<text>BASE jumping () is the recreational sport of jumping from fixed objects, using a parachute to descend to the ground. BASE is an acronym that stands for four categories of fixed objects from which one can jump: buildings, antennas (referring to radio masts), spans (bridges) and earth (cliffs). Participants jump from a fixed object such as a cliff and after an optional freefall delay deploy a parachute to slow their descent and land. A popular form of BASE jumping is wingsuit BASE jumping.

In contrast to other forms of parachuting, such as skydiving from airplanes, BASE jumps are performed from fixed objects that are generally at much lower altitudes, and BASE jumpers only carry one parachute.
BASE jumping is significantly more hazardous than other forms of parachuting and is widely considered to be one of the most dangerous extreme sports.

== History ==
=== Precursors ===
Fausto Veranzio is widely believed to have been the first person to build and test a parachute, by jumping from St Mark&#x27;s Campanile in Venice in 1617 when he was more than 65 years old. However these and other sporadic incidents were one-time experiments, not the actual systematic pursuit of a new form of parachuting.

=== Birth of B.A.S.E. jumping ===
There are precursors to the sport dating back hundreds of years. In 1966 Michael Pelkey and Brian Schubert jumped from El Capitan in Yosemite National Park. The acronym B.A.S.E. (now more commonly BASE) was later coined by filmmaker Carl Boenish, his wife Jean Boenish, Phil Smith and Phil Mayfield. Carl Boenish was an important catalyst behind modern BASE jumping and in 1978 he filmed jumps from El Capitan made using ram-air parachutes and the freefall tracking technique. While BASE jumps had been made prior to that time, the El Capitan activity was the effective birth of what is now called BASE jumping.

After 1978 the filmed jumps from El Capitan were repeated, not as an actual publicity exercise or as a movie stunt but as a true recreational activity. It was this that popularized BASE jumping more widely among parachutists. Carl Boenish continued to publish films and informational magazines on BASE jumping until his death in 1984 after a BASE jump off the Troll Wall. By this time the concept had spread among skydivers worldwide, with hundreds of participants making fixed-object jumps.

During the early eighties nearly all BASE jumps were made using standard skydiving equipment, including two parachutes (main and reserve), and deployment components. Later on, specialized equipment and techniques were developed specifically for the unique needs of BASE jumping.

Nowadays, recognizing the sport&#x27;s growing appeal and the potential for high-impact marketing, companies such as Red Bull have stepped in to sponsor athletes, further elevating the sport&#x27;s profile.

=== BASE numbers ===
BASE numbers are awarded to those who have made at least one jump from each of the four categories (buildings, antennae, spans and earth). When Phil Smith and Phil Mayfield jumped together from a Houston skyscraper on 18 January 1981, they became the first to attain the exclusive BASE numbers (BASE #1 and #2, respectively), having already jumped from an antenna, spans, and earthen objects. Jean and Carl Boenish qualified for BASE numbers 3 and 4 soon after. A separate &quot;award&quot; was soon enacted for Night BASE jumping when Mayfield completed each category at night, becoming Night BASE #1, with Smith qualifying a few weeks later.

Upon completing a jump from all of the four object categories, a jumper may choose to apply for a &quot;BASE number&quot;, awarded sequentially. The 1000th application for a BASE number was filed in March 2005 and BASE #1000 was awarded to Matt &quot;Harley&quot; Moilanen of Grand Rapids, Michigan. , over 2,000 BASE numbers have been issued.

== Equipment ==
In the early days of BASE jumping, people used modified skydiving gear, such as by removing the deployment bag and slider, stowing the lines in a tail pocket, and fitting a large pilot chute. However, modified skydiving gear is then prone to kinds of malfunction that are rare in normal skydiving (such as &quot;line-overs&quot; and broken lines). Modern purpose-built BASE jumping equipment is considered to be much safer and more reliable.

=== Parachute ===
The biggest difference in gear is that skydivers jump with both a main and a reserve parachute, while BASE jumpers carry only one parachute. BASE jumping parachutes are larger than skydiving parachutes and are typically flown with a wing loading of around . Vents are one element that make a parachute suitable for BASE jumping. BASE jumpers often use extra large pilot chutes to compensate for lower airspeed parachute deployments. On jumps from lower altitudes, the slider is removed for faster parachute opening.

=== Harness and container ===
BASE jumpers use a single-parachute harness and container system. Since there is only a single parachute, BASE jumping containers are mechanically much simpler than skydiving containers. This simplicity contributes to the safety and reliability of BASE jumping gear by eliminating many malfunctions that can occur with more complicated skydiving equipment. Since there is no reserve parachute, there is little need to cut-away their parachute, and many BASE harnesses do not contain a 3-ring release system. A modern ultralight BASE system including parachute, container, and harness can weigh as little as .

=== Clothing ===
When jumping from high mountains, BASE jumpers will often use special clothing to improve control and flight characteristics in the air. Wingsuit flying has become a popular form of BASE jumping in recent years, that allows jumpers to glide over long horizontal distances. Tracking suits inflate like wingsuits to give additional lift to jumpers, but maintain separation of arms and legs to allow for greater mobility and safety.

== Technique ==

BASE jumps can be broadly classified into low jumps and high jumps. The primary distinguishing characteristic of low BASE jumps versus high BASE jumps is the use of a slider reefing device to control the opening speed of the parachute, and whether the jumper falls long enough to reach terminal velocity.

=== Low BASE jumps ===
Low BASE jumps are those where the jumper does not reach terminal velocity. Sometimes referred to as &quot;slider down&quot; jumps because they are typically performed without a slider reefing device on the parachute. The lack of a slider enables the parachute to open more quickly. Other techniques for low BASE jumps include the use of a static line, direct bag, or P.C.A. (pilot chute assist). These devices form an attachment between the parachute and the jump platform, which stretches out the parachute and suspension lines as the jumper falls, before separating and allowing the parachute to inflate. This enables the very lowest jumpsâbelow to be made. It is common in the UK to jump from around the mark, due to the number of low cliffs at this height. Base jumpers have been known to jump from objects as low as , which leaves little to no canopy time and requires an immediate flare to land safely.

=== High BASE jumps ===
Many BASE jumpers are motivated to make jumps from higher objects involving free fall. High BASE jumps are those which are high enough for the jumper to reach terminal velocity. High BASE jumps are often called &quot;slider up&quot; jumps due to the use of a slider reefing device.
High BASE jumps present different hazards than low BASE jumps. With greater height and airspeed, jumpers can fly away from the cliff during freefall, allowing them to deploy their parachute far away from the cliff they jumped from and significantly reduce the chance of object striking. However, high BASE jumps also present new hazards such as complications resulting from the use of a wingsuit.

=== Tandem BASE jumps ===
Tandem BASE jumping is when a skilled pilot jumps with a passenger attached to their front. It is similar to skydiving and is offered in the US and many other countries. Tandem BASE is becoming a more accessible and legal form of BASE jumping.

== Records ==
; Lowest
: Go Fast Basejumper Johan Vervoort jumps from the 24 meters tall observation tower in the town of Herentals the exit point was 2 meters below the top of the tower, making the jump 22 meters high.

; Biggest
: &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; first listed a BASE jumping record with Carl Boenish&#x27;s 1984 leap from Trollveggen (Troll Wall) in Norway. It was described as the highest BASE jump. The jump was made two days before Boenish&#x27;s death at the same site.

; Highest altitude
: On August 26, 1992, Australians Nic Feteris and Glenn Singleman made a BASE jump from an altitude of jump off Great Trango Towers Pakistan. It was the world&#x27;s highest BASE jump off the earth at the time.

On May 23, 2006, Australians Glenn Singleman and Heather Swan made a BASE jump from an altitude of off Meru Peak in Northern India. They jumped in wingsuits.

On May 5, 2013, Russian Valery Rozov jumped off Changtse (the northern peak of the Mount Everest massif) from a height of . Using a specially-developed wingsuit, he glided down to the Rongbuk glacier more than 1,000 meters below, setting a new world record for highest altitude base jump. He had previously jumped off mountains in Asia, Antarctica and South America in 2004, 2007, 2008, 2010 and 2012. 

On October 5, 2016, Rozov broke his own record for highest altitude BASE jump when he leapt from a height of from Cho Oyu, the sixth-highest mountain in the world, landing on a glacier approximately two minutes later at an altitude of around . He later died while attempting another high-altitude BASE jump in Nepal in 2017.

; Other
: Other records include Captain Daniel G. Schilling setting the Guinness World Record for the most BASE jumps in a twenty-four-hour period. Schilling jumped off the Perrine Bridge in Twin Falls, Idaho, a record 201 times on July 8, 2006. In 2018 at Eikesdalen, Norway a world record was set with 69 BASE jumpers jumping from the cliff Katthammaren.

== Competitions ==
BASE competitions have been held since the early 1980s, with accurate landings or free-fall aerobatics used as the judging criteria. Recent years have seen a formal competition held at the high Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, judged on landing accuracy. In 2012 the World Wingsuit League held their first wingsuit BASE jumping competition in China.

==Notable jumps==
* February 2, 1912, Frederick R. Law parachuted from the top of the torch of the Statue of Liberty, above the ground.
* February 4, 1912, Franz Reichelt, tailor, jumped from the first deck of the Eiffel Tower testing his invention, the coat parachute, and died when he hit the ground. It was his first-ever attempt with the parachute and both the authorities and the spectators believed he intended to test it using a dummy.
* In 1913, it is claimed that Å tefan BaniÄ successfully jumped from a 15-story building to demonstrate his parachute design.
* In 1913, Russian student Vladimir Ossovski (ÐÐ»Ð°Ð´Ð¸Ð¼Ð¸Ñ ÐÑÑÐ¾Ð²ÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹), from the Saint-Petersburg Conservatory, jumped from the 53-meter high bridge over the river Seine in Rouen (France), using the parachute RK-1, invented a year before that by Gleb Kotelnikov (1872â1944). Ossovski planned to jump from the Eiffel Tower too, but the Parisian authorities did not allow it.
* In 1965, Erich Felbermayr from Wels jumped from the Kleine Zinne / Cima piccola di Lavaredo in the Dolomites.
* In 1966, Michael Pelkey and Brian Schubert jumped from El Capitan in the Yosemite Valley.
* On January 31, 1972, Rick Sylvester skied off Yosemite Valley&#x27;s El Capitan, making the first ski-BASE jump.
* On November 9, 1975, the first person to parachute off the CN Tower in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, was Bill Eustace, a member of the tower&#x27;s construction crew. He was fired.
* On July 22, 1975, Owen J. Quinn parachuted from the North Tower of the World Trade Center to publicize the plight of the poor.
* In 1976, Rick Sylvester skied off Canada&#x27;s Mount Asgard for the ski chase sequence of the James Bond movie &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;, giving the wider world its first look at BASE jumping.
* In 1979, Santee, California skydiver Roger Worthington completed one of the first &quot;Span&quot; jumps when he successfully parachuted off of the newly constructed Pine Valley Creek Bridge (A.K.A. Nello Irwin Greer Memorial Bridge) on Interstate 8 in San Diego County. Upon take off he held a red smoke flare in each hand. When interviewed afterward he claimed to know of no other &quot;bridge jumpers&quot; in the country.
* On February 22, 1982, Wayne Allwood, an Australian skydiving accuracy champion, parachuted from a helicopter over the Sydney CBD and landed on the small top area of Sydney&#x27;s Centrepoint Tower, approximately above the ground. Upon landing, Allwood discarded and secured his parachute, then used a full-sized reserve parachute to BASE jump into Hyde Park below.
* In 1986, Welshman Eric Jones became the first person to BASE jump from the Eiger.
* On October 22, 1999, Jan Davis died while attempting a BASE jump from El Capitan in Yosemite Valley. Davis&#x27; jump was part of an organized act of civil disobedience protesting the NPS air delivery regulations (36 CFR 2.17(a)), which make BASE jumping illegal in national park areas.
* In 2000, Hannes Arch and Ueli Gegenschatz were the first to BASE jump from the 1800-metre-high north face of the Eiger.
* In 2005, Karina Hollekim became the first woman to perform a ski-BASE.
* In 2009, three womenâ29-year-old Australian Livia Dickie, 28-year-old Venezuelan Ana Isabel Dao, and 32-year-old Norwegian Anniken BinzâBASE jumped from Angel Falls, the highest waterfall in the world.
* In September 2013, three men parachuted off the then-under-construction One World Trade Center in New York City. Footage of their jump was recorded using head cams and can be seen on YouTube. In March 2014, the three jumpers turned themselves in. They were sentenced to community service and a fine.

==Comparison with skydiving==
BASE jumps are typically performed from much lower altitudes than in skydiving. Skydivers are required to deploy their main parachute above altitude. BASE jumps are frequently made from less than . A BASE jump from a object is only about 5.6 seconds from the ground if the jumper remains in free fall. Standard skydiving parachute systems are not designed for this situation, so BASE jumpers use specially designed harnesses and parachute systems.

Many BASE jumps, particularly in the UK are made from around due to the number of low cliffs at this height. Jumpers will use a static line method to ensure their canopy is extracted as they jump, as at this height, it is too low to freefall.

BASE jumps generally entail slower airspeeds than typical skydives (due to the limited altitude), a BASE jumper does not always reach terminal velocity. Skydivers use the airflow to stabilize their position. BASE jumpers, falling at lower speeds, have less aerodynamic control. The attitude of the body at the moment of jumping determines the stability of flight in the first few seconds, before sufficient airspeed has built up to enable aerodynamic stability. On low BASE jumps, parachute deployment takes place during this early phase of flight. If the parachute is deployed while the jumper is unstable, there is a high risk of entanglement or malfunction. The jumper may also not be facing the right direction. Such an off-heading opening is not as problematic in skydiving, but an off-heading opening that results in object strike has caused many serious injuries and deaths in BASE jumping.

BASE jumps are more hazardous than skydives primarily due to proximity to the object serving as the jump platform. BASE jumping frequently occurs in mountainous terrain, often having much smaller areas in which to land in comparison to a typical skydiving dropzone. BASE jumping is significantly more dangerous than similar sports such as skydiving from aircraft.

== Legality ==
BASE jumping is generally not illegal in most places. However, in some cases such as building and antenna jumps, jumping is often done covertly without the permission of owners, which can lead to charges such as trespassing. In some jurisdictions it may be permissible to use land until specifically told not to. The Perrine Bridge in Twin Falls, Idaho, is an example of a man-made structure in the United States where BASE jumping is allowed year-round without a permit.

In U.S. National Parks, BASE jumping is allowed pursuant to the terms of a special use permit. There is no record of the U.S. National Parks granting a permit for BASE jumping, with the sole exception of a permit granted for the annual Bridge Day event in New River Gorge National Park. Other U.S. public land, including land controlled by the Bureau of Land Management, does not ban BASE jumping, and there are numerous jumpable objects on BLM land.

The legal position is different at other sites and in other countries. For example, in Norway&#x27;s Lysefjord (from the mountain Kjerag), BASE jumpers are made welcome. Many sites in the European Alps, near Chamonix and on the Eiger, are also open to jumpers. Some other Norwegian places, like the Troll Wall, are banned because of dangerous rescue missions in the past. In Austria, jumping from mountain cliffs is generally allowed, whereas the use of bridges (such as the Europabruecke near Innsbruck, Tirol) or dams is generally prohibited. Australia has some of the toughest stances on BASE jumping: it specifically bans BASE jumping from certain objects, such as the Sydney Harbour Bridge.

== Safety ==
Recent statistics reflect improved safety of the activity. The 2024 Bridge Day Event which saw the participation of 325 BASE jumpers completing 755 BASE jumps resulted in zero jumper injuries, in contrast to two non-jumper related medical transports from the same event. And in the year 2023 the United States saw zero BASE fatalities. A study of BASE jumping fatalities estimated that the overall annual fatality risk in 2002 was one fatality per 60 participants. A study of 20,850 BASE jumps from the Kjerag Massif in Norway reported nine fatalities over the 11-year period from 1995 to 2005, or one in every 2,317 jumps. However, at that site, one in every 254 jumps over that period resulted in a nonfatal accident. BASE jumping is one of the most dangerous recreational activities in the world, with a fatality and injury rate 43 times higher than that of parachuting from a plane.

, the BASE Fatality List records 480 deaths for BASE jumping since April 1981.

<text>Beauty is commonly described as a feature of objects that makes them pleasurable to perceive. Such objects include landscapes, sunsets, humans and works of art. Beauty, art and taste are the main subjects of aesthetics, one of the fields of study within philosophy. As a positive aesthetic value, it is contrasted with ugliness as its negative counterpart.

One difficulty in understanding beauty is that it has both objective and subjective aspects: it is seen as a property of things but also as depending on the emotional response of observers. Because of its subjective side, beauty is said to be &quot;in the eye of the beholder&quot;. It has been argued that the ability on the side of the subject needed to perceive and judge beauty, sometimes referred to as the &quot;sense of taste&quot;, can be trained and that the verdicts of experts coincide in the long run. This suggests the standards of validity of judgments of beauty are intersubjective, i.e. dependent on a group of judges, rather than fully subjective or objective.

Conceptions of beauty aim to capture what is essential to all beautiful things. &quot;Classical conceptions&quot; define beauty in terms of the relation between the beautiful object as a whole and its parts: the parts should stand in the right proportion to each other and thus compose an integrated harmonious whole. &quot;Hedonist conceptions&quot; see a necessary connection between pleasure and beauty, e.g. that for an object to be beautiful is for it to cause disinterested pleasure. Other conceptions include defining beautiful objects in terms of their value, of a loving attitude toward them or of their function.

== Overview ==
Beauty, together with art and taste, is the main subject of aesthetics, one of the major branches of philosophy. Beauty is usually categorized as an aesthetic property besides other properties, like grace, elegance or the sublime. As a positive aesthetic value, beauty is contrasted with ugliness as its negative counterpart. Beauty is often listed as one of the three fundamental concepts of human understanding besides truth and goodness.

Objectivists or realists see beauty as an objective or mind-independent feature of beautiful things, which is denied by &quot;subjectivists&quot;. The source of this debate is that judgments of beauty seem to be based on subjective grounds, namely our feelings, while claiming universal correctness at the same time. This tension is sometimes referred to as the &quot;antinomy of taste&quot;. Adherents of both sides have suggested that a certain faculty, commonly called a &quot;sense of taste&quot;, is necessary for making reliable judgments about beauty. David Hume, for example, suggests that this faculty can be trained and that the verdicts of experts coincide in the long run.

Beauty is mainly discussed in relation to &quot;concrete objects&quot; accessible to sensory perception. It has been suggested that the beauty of a thing supervenes on the sensory features of this thing. It has also been proposed that abstract objects like stories or mathematical proofs can be beautiful. Beauty plays a central role in works of art and nature.

An influential distinction among beautiful things, according to Immanuel Kant, is that between &quot;adherent&quot; beauty (&quot;pulchritudo adhaerens&quot;) and &quot;free beauty&quot; (&quot;pulchritudo vaga&quot;). A thing has adherent beauty if its beauty depends on the conception or function of this thing, unlike free or absolute beauty. Examples of adherent beauty include an ox which is beautiful as an ox but not beautiful as a horse or a photograph which is beautiful, because it depicts a beautiful building but that lacks beauty generally speaking because of its low quality.

== Objectivism and subjectivism ==

Judgments of beauty seem to occupy an intermediary position between objective judgments, e.g. concerning the mass and shape of a grapefruit, and subjective likes, e.g. concerning whether the grapefruit tastes good. Judgments of beauty differ from the former because they are based on subjective feelings rather than objective perception. But they also differ from the latter because they lay claim on universal correctness. This tension is also reflected in common language. On the one hand, we talk about beauty as an objective feature of the world that is ascribed, for example, to landscapes, paintings or humans. The subjective side, on the other hand, is expressed in sayings like &quot;beauty is in the eye of the beholder&quot;.

These two positions are often referred to as &quot;objectivism&quot; (or realism) and &quot;subjectivism&quot;. &quot;Objectivism&quot; is the traditional view, while subjectivism developed more recently in western philosophy. Objectivists hold that beauty is a mind-independent feature of things. On this account, the beauty of a landscape is independent of who perceives it or whether it is perceived at all. Disagreements may be explained by an inability to perceive this feature, sometimes referred to as a &quot;lack of taste&quot;. Subjectivism, on the other hand, denies the mind-independent existence of beauty. Influential for the development of this position was John Locke&#x27;s distinction between primary qualities, which the object has independent of the observer, and secondary qualities, which constitute powers in the object to produce certain ideas in the observer. When applied to beauty, there is still a sense in which it depends on the object and its powers. But this account makes the possibility of genuine disagreements about claims of beauty implausible, since the same object may produce very different ideas in distinct observers. The notion of &quot;taste&quot; can still be used to explain why different people disagree about what is beautiful, but there is no objectively right or wrong taste, there are just different tastes.

The problem with both the objectivist and the subjectivist position in their extreme form is that each has to deny some intuitions about beauty. This issue is sometimes discussed under the label &quot;antinomy of taste&quot;. It has prompted various philosophers to seek a unified theory that can take all these intuitions into account. One promising route to solve this problem is to move from subjective to &quot;intersubjective theories&quot;, which hold that the standards of validity of judgments of taste are intersubjective or dependent on a group of judges rather than objective. This approach tries to explain how genuine disagreement about beauty is possible despite the fact that beauty is a mind-dependent property, dependent not on an individual but a group. A closely related theory sees beauty as a &quot;secondary&quot; or &quot;response-dependent property&quot;. On one such account, an object is beautiful &quot;if it causes pleasure by virtue of its aesthetic properties&quot;. The problem that different people respond differently can be addressed by combining response-dependence theories with so-called &quot;ideal-observer theories&quot;: it only matters how an ideal observer would respond. There is no general agreement on how &quot;ideal observers&quot; are to be defined, but it is usually assumed that they are experienced judges of beauty with a fully developed sense of taste. This suggests an indirect way of solving the &quot;antinomy of taste&quot;: instead of looking for necessary and sufficient conditions of beauty itself, one can learn to identify the qualities of good critics and rely on their judgments. This approach only works if unanimity among experts was ensured. But even experienced judges may disagree in their judgments, which threatens to undermine ideal-observer theories.

== Conceptions ==
Various conceptions of the essential features of beautiful things have been proposed but there is no consensus as to which is the right one.

=== Classical ===

The &quot;classical conception&quot; (see Classicism) defines beauty in terms of the relation between the beautiful object &quot;as a whole&quot; and its &quot;parts&quot;: the parts should stand in the right proportion to each other and thus compose an integrated harmonious whole. On this account, which found its most explicit articulation in the Italian Renaissance, the beauty of a human body, for example, depends, among other things, on the right proportion of the different parts of the body and on the overall symmetry. One problem with this conception is that it is difficult to give a general and detailed description of what is meant by &quot;harmony between parts&quot; and raises the suspicion that defining beauty through harmony results in exchanging one unclear term for another one. Some attempts have been made to dissolve this suspicion by searching for &quot;laws of beauty&quot;, like the golden ratio.

18th century philosopher Alexander Baumgarten, for example, saw laws of beauty in analogy with laws of nature and believed that they could be discovered through empirical research. As of 2003, these attempts have failed to find a general definition of beauty and several authors take the opposite claim that such laws cannot be formulated, as part of their definition of beauty.

=== Hedonism ===

A very common element in many conceptions of beauty is its relation to pleasure. Hedonism makes this relation part of the definition of beauty by holding that there is a necessary connection between pleasure and beauty, e.g. that for an object to be beautiful is for it to cause pleasure or that the experience of beauty is always accompanied by pleasure. This account is sometimes labeled as &quot;aesthetic hedonism&quot; in order to distinguish it from other forms of hedonism. An influential articulation of this position comes from Thomas Aquinas, who treats beauty as &quot;that which pleases in the very apprehension of it&quot;. Immanuel Kant explains this pleasure through a harmonious interplay between the faculties of understanding and imagination. A further question for hedonists is how to explain the relation between beauty and pleasure. This problem is akin to the Euthyphro dilemma: is something beautiful because we enjoy it or do we enjoy it because it is beautiful? Identity theorists solve this problem by denying that there is a difference between beauty and pleasure: they identify beauty, or the appearance of it, with the experience of aesthetic pleasure.

Hedonists usually restrict and specify the notion of pleasure in various ways in order to avoid obvious counterexamples. One important distinction in this context is the difference between &quot;pure&quot; and &quot;mixed pleasure&quot;. Pure pleasure excludes any form of pain or unpleasant feeling while the experience of mixed pleasure can include unpleasant elements. But beauty can involve mixed pleasure, for example, in the case of a beautifully tragic story, which is why mixed pleasure is usually allowed in hedonist conceptions of beauty.

Another problem faced by hedonist theories is that we take pleasure from many things that are not beautiful. One way to address this issue is to associate beauty with a special type of pleasure: &quot;aesthetic&quot; or &quot;disinterested pleasure&quot;. A pleasure is disinterested if it is indifferent to the existence of the beautiful object or if it did not arise owing to an antecedent desire through means-end reasoning. For example, the joy of looking at a beautiful landscape would still be valuable if it turned out that this experience was an illusion, which would not be true if this joy was due to seeing the landscape as a valuable real estate opportunity. Opponents of hedonism usually concede that many experiences of beauty are pleasurable but deny that this is true for all cases. For example, a cold jaded critic may still be a good judge of beauty because of her years of experience but lack the joy that initially accompanied her work. One way to avoid this objection is to allow responses to beautiful things to lack pleasure while insisting that all beautiful things merit pleasure, that aesthetic pleasure is the only appropriate response to them.

=== Others ===
G. E. Moore explained beauty in regard to intrinsic value as &quot;that of which the admiring contemplation is good in itself&quot;. This definition connects beauty to experience while managing to avoid some of the problems usually associated with subjectivist positions since it allows that things may be beautiful even if they are never experienced.

Another subjectivist theory of beauty comes from George Santayana, who suggested that we project pleasure onto the things we call &quot;beautiful&quot;. So in a process akin to a category mistake, one treats one&#x27;s subjective pleasure as an objective property of the beautiful thing. Other conceptions include defining beauty in terms of a loving or longing attitude toward the beautiful object or in terms of its usefulness or function. In 1871, functionalist Charles Darwin explained beauty as result of accumulative sexual selection in &quot;The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex&quot;.

== In philosophy ==
===Greco-Roman tradition===
The classical Greek noun that best translates to the English-language words &quot;beauty&quot; or &quot;beautiful&quot; was , &quot;kallos&quot;, and the adjective was ÎºÎ±Î»ÏÏ, &quot;kalos&quot;. This is also translated as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;of fine quality&quot; and thus has a broader meaning than mere physical or material beauty. Similarly, &quot;kallos&quot; was used differently from the English word beauty in that it first and foremost applied to humans and bore an erotic connotation. The Koine Greek word for beautiful was á½¡ÏÎ±á¿Î¿Ï, &quot;hÅraios&quot;, an adjective etymologically coming from the word á½¥ÏÎ±, &quot;hÅra&quot;, meaning &quot;hour&quot;. In Koine Greek, beauty was thus associated with &quot;being of one&#x27;s hour&quot;. Thus, a ripe fruit (of its time) was considered beautiful, whereas a young woman trying to appear older or an older woman trying to appear younger would not be considered beautiful. In Attic Greek, &quot;hÅraios&quot; had many meanings, including &quot;youthful&quot; and &quot;ripe old age&quot;. Another classical term in use to describe beauty was &quot;&quot; (Latin).

Beauty for ancient thinkers existed both in , which is the material world as it is, and as embodied in the spirit, which is the world of mental formations. Greek mythology mentions Helen of Troy as the most beautiful woman. Ancient Greek architecture is based on this view of symmetry and proportion.

====Pre-Socratic====
In one fragment of Heraclitus&#x27;s writings (&quot;Fragment 106&quot;) he mentions beauty, this reads: &quot;To God all things are beautiful, good, right...&quot; The earliest Western theory of beauty can be found in the works of early Greek philosophers from the pre-Socratic period, such as Pythagoras, who conceived of beauty as useful for a moral education of the soul. He wrote of how people experience pleasure when aware of a certain type of formal situation present in reality, perceivable by sight or through the ear and discovered the underlying mathematical ratios in the harmonic scales in music. The Pythagoreans conceived of the presence of beauty in universal terms, which is, as existing in a cosmological state, they observed beauty in &quot;the heavens&quot;. They saw a strong connection between mathematics and beauty. In particular, they noted that objects proportioned according to the golden ratio seemed more attractive.

====Classical period====
The classical concept of beauty is one that exhibits perfect proportion (Wolfflin). In this context, the concept belonged often within the discipline of mathematics. An idea of spiritual beauty emerged during the classical period, beauty was something embodying divine goodness, while the demonstration of behaviour which might be classified as beautiful, from an inner state of morality which is aligned to the good.

The writing of Xenophon shows a conversation between Socrates and Aristippus. Socrates discerned differences in the conception of the beautiful, for example, in inanimate objects, the effectiveness of execution of design was a deciding factor on the perception of beauty in something. By the account of Xenophon, Socrates found beauty congruent with that to which was defined as the morally good, in short, he thought beauty coincident with the good.

Beauty is a subject of Plato in his work Symposium. In the work, the high priestess Diotima describes how beauty moves out from a core singular appreciation of the body to outer appreciations via loved ones, to the world in its state of culture and society (Wright). In other words, Diotoma gives to Socrates an explanation of how love should begin with erotic attachment, and end with the transcending of the physical to an appreciation of beauty as a thing in itself. The ascent of love begins with one&#x27;s own body, then secondarily, in appreciating beauty in another&#x27;s body, thirdly beauty in the soul, which cognates to beauty in the mind in the modern sense, fourthly beauty in institutions, laws and activities, fifthly beauty in knowledge, the sciences, and finally to lastly love beauty itself, which translates to the original Greek language term as &quot; to &quot;. In the final state, &quot;auto to kalon&quot; and truth are united as one. There is the sense in the text, concerning love and beauty they both co-exist but are still independent or, in other words, mutually exclusive, since love does not have beauty since it seeks beauty. The work toward the end provides a description of beauty in a negative sense.

Plato also discusses beauty in his work &quot;Phaedrus&quot;, and identifies Alcibiades as beautiful in &quot;Parmenides&quot;. He considered beauty to be the Idea (Form) above all other Ideas. Platonic thought synthesized beauty with the divine. Scruton (cited: Konstan) states Plato states of the idea of beauty, of it (the idea), being something inviting desirousness (c.f ), and, promotes an intellectual (c.f. ) of desire. For Alexander Nehamas, it is only the locating of desire to which the sense of beauty exists, in the considerations of Plato.

Aristotle defines beauty in Metaphysics as having order, symmetry and definiteness &quot;which the mathematical sciences exhibit to a special degree&quot;. He saw a relationship between the beautiful (&quot;to kalon&quot;) and virtue, arguing that &quot;Virtue aims at the beautiful.&quot;

====Roman====
In &quot;De Natura Deorum&quot;, Cicero wrote: &quot;the splendour and beauty of creation&quot;, in respect to this, and all the facets of reality resulting from creation, he postulated these to be a reason to see the existence of a God as creator.

===Western Middle Ages===
In the Middle Ages, Catholic philosophers like Thomas Aquinas included beauty among the transcendental attributes of being. In his Summa Theologica, Aquinas described the three conditions of beauty as: integritas (wholeness), consonantia (harmony and proportion), and claritas (a radiance and clarity that makes the form of a thing apparent to the mind).

In the Gothic Architecture of the High and Late Middle Ages, light was considered the most beautiful revelation of God, which was heralded in design. Examples are the stained glass of Gothic Cathedrals including Notre-Dame de Paris and Chartres Cathedral.

St. Augustine said of beauty &quot;Beauty is indeed a good gift of God; but that the good may not think it a great good, God dispenses it even to the wicked.&quot;

===Renaissance===
Classical philosophy and sculptures of men and women produced according to the Greek philosophers&#x27; tenets of ideal human beauty were rediscovered in Renaissance Europe, leading to a re-adoption of what became known as a &quot;classical ideal&quot;. In terms of female human beauty, a woman whose appearance conforms to these tenets is still called a &quot;classical beauty&quot; or said to possess a &quot;classical beauty&quot;, whilst the foundations laid by Greek and Roman artists have also supplied the standard for male beauty and female beauty in western civilization as seen, for example, in the &quot;Winged Victory of Samothrace&quot;. During the Gothic era, the classical aesthetical canon of beauty was rejected as sinful. Later, Renaissance and Humanist thinkers rejected this view, and considered beauty to be the product of rational order and harmonious proportions. Renaissance artists and architects (such as Giorgio Vasari in his &quot;Lives of Artists&quot;) criticised the Gothic period as irrational and barbarian. This point of view of Gothic art lasted until Romanticism, in the 19th century. Vasari aligned himself to the classical notion and thought of beauty as defined as arising from proportion and order.

===Age of Reason===

The Age of Reason saw a rise in an interest in beauty as a philosophical subject. For example, Scottish philosopher Francis Hutcheson argued that beauty is &quot;unity in variety and variety in unity&quot;. He wrote that beauty was neither purely subjective nor purely objectiveâit could be understood not as &quot;any Quality suppos&#x27;d to be in the Object, which should of itself be beautiful, without relation to any Mind which perceives it: For Beauty, like other Names of sensible Ideas, properly denotes the &quot;Perception&quot; of some mind; ... however we generally imagine that there is something in the Object just like our Perception.&quot;

Immanuel Kant believed that there could be no &quot;universal criterion of the beautiful&quot; and that the experience of beauty is subjective, but that an object is judged to be beautiful when it seems to display &quot;purposiveness&quot;; that is, when its form is perceived to have the character of a thing designed according to some principle and fitted for a purpose. He distinguished &quot;free beauty&quot; from &quot;merely adherent beauty&quot;, explaining that &quot;the first presupposes no concept of what the object ought to be; the second does presuppose such a concept and the perfection of the object in accordance therewith.&quot; By this definition, free beauty is found in seashells and wordless music; adherent beauty in buildings and the human body.

The Romantic poets, too, became highly concerned with the nature of beauty, with John Keats arguing in &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot; that:

: Beauty is truth, truth beauty, âthat is all
: Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.

=== Western 19th and 20th century ===
In the Romantic period, Edmund Burke postulated a difference between beauty in its classical meaning and the sublime. The concept of the sublime, as explicated by Burke and Kant, suggested viewing Gothic art and architecture, though not in accordance with the classical standard of beauty, as sublime.

The 20th century saw an increasing rejection of beauty by artists and philosophers alike, culminating in postmodernism&#x27;s anti-aesthetics. This is despite beauty being a central concern of one of postmodernism&#x27;s main influences, Friedrich Nietzsche, who argued that the Will to Power was the Will to Beauty.

In the aftermath of postmodernism&#x27;s rejection of beauty, thinkers have returned to beauty as an important value. American analytic philosopher Guy Sircello proposed his New Theory of Beauty as an effort to reaffirm the status of beauty as an important philosophical concept. He rejected the subjectivism of Kant and sought to identify the properties inherent in an object that make it beautiful. He called qualities such as vividness, boldness, and subtlety &quot;properties of qualitative degree&quot; (PQDs) and stated that a PQD makes an object beautiful if it is notâand does not create the appearance ofâ&quot;a property of deficiency, lack, or defect&quot;; and if the PQD is strongly present in the object.

Elaine Scarry argues that beauty is related to justice.

Beauty is also studied by psychologists and neuroscientists in the field of experimental aesthetics and neuroesthetics respectively. Psychological theories see beauty as a form of pleasure. Correlational findings support the view that more beautiful objects are also more pleasing. Some studies suggest that higher experienced beauty is associated with activity in the medial orbitofrontal cortex. This approach of localizing the processing of beauty in one brain region has received criticism within the field.

Philosopher and novelist Umberto Eco wrote &quot;On Beauty: A History of a Western Idea&quot; (2004) and &quot;On Ugliness&quot; (2007). The narrator of his novel &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot; follows Aquinas in declaring: &quot;three things concur in creating beauty: first of all integrity or perfection, and for this reason, we consider ugly all incomplete things; then proper proportion or consonance; and finally clarity and light&quot;, before going on to say &quot;the sight of the beautiful implies peace&quot;. Mike Phillips has described Umberto Eco&#x27;s &quot;On Beauty&quot; as &quot;incoherent&quot; and criticized him for focusing only on Western European history and devoting none of his book to Eastern European, Asian, or African history. Amy Finnerty described Eco&#x27;s work &quot;On Ugliness&quot; favorably.

===Chinese philosophy===
Chinese philosophy has traditionally not made a separate discipline of the philosophy of beauty. Confucius identified beauty with goodness, and considered a virtuous personality to be the greatest of beauties: In his philosophy, &quot;a neighborhood with a &quot;ren&quot; man in it is a beautiful neighborhood.&quot; Confucius&#x27;s student Zeng Shen expressed a similar idea: &quot;few men could see the beauty in some one whom they dislike.&quot; Mencius considered &quot;complete truthfulness&quot; to be beauty. Zhu Xi said: &quot;When one has strenuously implemented goodness until it is filled to completion and has accumulated truth, then the beauty will reside within it and will not depend on externals.&quot;

==Human attributes==

The word &quot;beauty&quot; is often used as a countable noun to describe a beautiful woman.

The characterization of a person as &quot;beautiful&quot;, whether on an individual basis or by community consensus, is often based on some combination of &quot;inner beauty&quot;, which includes psychological factors such as personality, intelligence, , politeness, charisma, integrity, and elegance, and &quot;outer beauty&quot; (i.e. physical attractiveness) which includes physical attributes which are valued on an aesthetic basis.

Standards of beauty have changed over time, based on changing cultural values. Historically, paintings show a wide range of different standards for beauty.

A strong indicator of physical beauty is &quot;averageness&quot;. When images of human faces are averaged together to form a composite image, they become progressively closer to the &quot;ideal&quot; image and are perceived as more attractive. This was first noticed in 1883, when Francis Galton overlaid photographic composite images of the faces of vegetarians and criminals to see if there was a typical facial appearance for each. When doing this, he noticed that the composite images were more attractive as compared to any of the individual images. Researchers have replicated the result under more controlled conditions and found that the computer-generated, mathematical average of a series of faces is rated more favorably than individual faces. It is argued that it is evolutionarily advantageous that sexual creatures are attracted to mates who possess predominantly common or average features, because it suggests the absence of genetic or acquired defects.

Since the 1970s there has been increasing evidence that a preference for beautiful faces emerges early in infancy, and is probably innate,
and that the rules by which attractiveness is established are similar across different genders and cultures.

A feature of beautiful women which has been explored by researchers is a waistâhip ratio of approximately 0.70. As of 2004, physiologists had shown that women with hourglass figures were more fertile than other women because of higher levels of certain female hormones, a fact that may subconsciously condition males choosing mates. In 2008, other commentators have suggested that this preference may not be universal. For instance, in some non-Western cultures in which women have to do work such as finding food, men tend to have preferences for higher waist-hip ratios.

Exposure to the thin ideal in mass media, such as fashion magazines, directly correlates with body dissatisfaction, low self-esteem, and the development of eating disorders among female viewers. Further, the widening gap between individual body sizes and societal ideals continues to breed anxiety among young girls as they grow, highlighting the dangerous nature of beauty standards in society.

=== Western concept===

A study using Chinese immigrants and Hispanic, Black and White American citizens found that their ideals of female beauty were not significantly different. Participants in the study rated Asian and Latina women as more attractive than White and Black women, and it was found that Asian and Latina women had more of the attributes that were considered attractive for women. Exposure to Western media did not influence or improve the Asian men&#x27;s ratings of White women.

One study found that East Asian women in the United States are closer to the ideal figure promoted in Western media, and that East Asian women conform to both Western and Eastern influences in the United States. East Asian men were found to be more impacted by Western beauty ideals then East Asian women, in the United States. East Asian men felt as though their bodies were not large enough and therefore deviated from the Western norm. East Asian men and white Western women were found to have the highest levels of body dissatisfaction in the United States. A study of African American and South Asian women found that some had internalized a white beauty ideal that placed light skin and straight hair at the top.

Eurocentric standards for men include tallness, leanness, and muscularity, which have been idolized through American media, such as in Hollywood films and magazine covers.

In of the United States, African Americans have historically been subjected to beauty ideals that often do not reflect their own appearance, which can lead to issues of low self-esteem. African-American philosopher Cornel West elaborates that, &quot;much of black self-hatred and self-contempt has to do with the refusal of many black Americans to love their own black bodies-especially their black noses, hips, lips, and hair.&quot; According to Patton (2006), the stereotype of African-American women&#x27;s inferiority (relative to other races of women) maintains a system of oppression based on race and gender that operates to the detriment of women of all races, and also black men. In the 1960s, the black is beautiful cultural movement sought to dispel the notion of a Eurocentric concept of beauty.

Much criticism has been directed at models of beauty which depend solely upon Western ideals of beauty, as seen, for example, in the Barbie franchise. Criticisms of Barbie are often centered around concerns that children consider Barbie a role model of beauty and will attempt to emulate her. One of the most common criticisms of Barbie is that she promotes an unrealistic idea of body image for a young woman, leading to a risk that girls who attempt to emulate her will become anorexic.

As of 1998, these criticisms of the lack of diversity in such franchises as the Barbie model of beauty in Western culture, had led to a dialogue to create non-exclusive models of Western ideals in body type for young girls who do not match the thinness ideal that Barbie represents. Mattel responded to these criticisms.

In East Asian cultures, familial pressures and cultural norms shape beauty ideals. A 2017 experimental study concluded that Asian cultural idealization of &quot;fragile&quot; girls was impacting Asian American women&#x27;s lifestyle, eating, and appearance choices.

==Effects on society==
Researchers have found that good-looking students get higher grades from their teachers than students with an ordinary appearance. Some studies using mock criminal trials have shown that physically attractive &quot;defendants&quot; are less likely to be convictedâand if convicted are likely to receive lighter sentencesâthan less attractive ones (although the opposite effect was observed when the alleged crime was swindling, perhaps because jurors perceived the defendant&#x27;s attractiveness as facilitating the crime). Studies among teens and young adults, such as those of psychiatrist and self-help author Eva Ritvo show that skin conditions have a profound effect on social behavior and opportunity.

How much money a person earns may also be influenced by physical beauty. One study found that people low in physical attractiveness earn 5 to 10 percent less than ordinary-looking people, who in turn earn 3 to 8 percent less than those who are considered good-looking. In the market for loans, the least attractive people are less likely to get approvals, although they are less likely to default. In the marriage market, women&#x27;s looks are at a premium, but men&#x27;s looks do not matter much. The impact of physical attractiveness on earnings varies across races, with the largest beauty wage gap among black women and black men.

Conversely, being very unattractive increases the individual&#x27;s propensity for criminal activity for a number of crimes ranging from burglary to theft to selling illicit drugs.

Discrimination against others based on their appearance is known as lookism.

<doc id="4436" wikidata="Q178036" url="?curid=4436" title="Brownian motion">
<text>Brownian motion is the random motion of particles suspended in a medium (a liquid or a gas).

This motion pattern typically consists of random fluctuations in a particle&#x27;s position inside a fluid sub-domain, followed by a relocation to another sub-domain. Each relocation is followed by more fluctuations within the new closed volume. This pattern describes a fluid at thermal equilibrium, defined by a given temperature. Within such a fluid, there exists no preferential direction of flow (as in transport phenomena). More specifically, the fluid&#x27;s overall linear and angular momenta remain null over time. The kinetic energies of the molecular Brownian motions, together with those of molecular rotations and vibrations, sum up to the caloric component of a fluid&#x27;s internal energy (the equipartition theorem).

This motion is named after the Scottish botanist Robert Brown, who first described the phenomenon in 1827, while looking through a microscope at pollen of the plant &quot;Clarkia pulchella&quot; immersed in water. In 1900, the French mathematician Louis Bachelier modeled the stochastic process now called Brownian motion in his doctoral thesis, The Theory of Speculation (ThÃ©orie de la spÃ©culation), prepared under the supervision of Henri PoincarÃ©. Then, in 1905, theoretical physicist Albert Einstein published a paper where he modeled the motion of the pollen particles as being moved by individual water molecules, making one of his first major scientific contributions.

The direction of the force of atomic bombardment is constantly changing, and at different times the particle is hit more on one side than another, leading to the seemingly random nature of the motion. This explanation of Brownian motion served as convincing evidence that atoms and molecules exist and was further verified experimentally by Jean Perrin in 1908. Perrin was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1926 &quot;for his work on the discontinuous structure of matter&quot;.

The many-body interactions that yield the Brownian pattern cannot be solved by a model accounting for every involved molecule. Consequently, only probabilistic models applied to molecular populations can be employed to describe it. Two such models of the statistical mechanics, due to Einstein and Smoluchowski, are presented below. Another, pure probabilistic class of models is the class of the stochastic process models. There exist sequences of both simpler and more complicated stochastic processes which converge (in the limit) to Brownian motion (see random walk and Donsker&#x27;s theorem).

==History==
The Roman philosopher-poet Lucretius&#x27; scientific poem &quot;On the Nature of Things&quot; () has a remarkable description of the motion of dust particles in verses 113â140 from Book II. He uses this as a proof of the existence of atoms:

Although the mingling, tumbling motion of dust particles is caused largely by air currents, the glittering, jiggling motion of small dust particles is caused chiefly by true Brownian dynamics; Lucretius &quot;perfectly describes and explains the Brownian movement by a wrong example&quot;.

While Jan Ingenhousz described the irregular motion of coal dust particles on the surface of alcohol in 1785, the discovery of this phenomenon is often credited to the botanist Robert Brown in 1827. Brown was studying pollen grains of the plant &quot;Clarkia pulchella&quot; suspended in water under a microscope when he observed minute particles, ejected by the pollen grains, executing a jittery motion. By repeating the experiment with particles of inorganic matter he was able to rule out that the motion was life-related, although its origin was yet to be explained.

The first person to describe the mathematics behind Brownian motion was Thorvald N. Thiele in a paper on the method of least squares published in 1880. This was followed independently by Louis Bachelier in 1900 in his PhD thesis &quot;The theory of speculation&quot;, in which he presented a stochastic analysis of the stock and option markets. The Brownian model of financial markets is often cited, but Benoit Mandelbrot rejected its applicability to stock price movements in part because these are discontinuous.

Albert Einstein (in one of his 1905 papers) and Marian Smoluchowski (1906) brought the solution of the problem to the attention of physicists, and presented it as a way to indirectly confirm the existence of atoms and molecules. Their equations describing Brownian motion were subsequently verified by the experimental work of Jean Baptiste Perrin in 1908.
The instantaneous velocity of the Brownian motion can be defined as , when , where is the momentum relaxation time. 
In 2010, the instantaneous velocity of a Brownian particle (a glass microsphere trapped in air with optical tweezers) was measured successfully. The velocity data verified the MaxwellâBoltzmann velocity distribution, and the equipartition theorem for a Brownian particle.

==Statistical mechanics theories==

=== Einstein&#x27;s theory ===
There are two parts to Einstein&#x27;s theory: the first part consists in the formulation of a diffusion equation for Brownian particles, in which the diffusion coefficient is related to the mean squared displacement of a Brownian particle, while the second part consists in relating the diffusion coefficient to measurable physical quantities. In this way Einstein was able to determine the size of atoms, and how many atoms there are in a mole, or the molecular weight in grams, of a gas. In accordance to Avogadro&#x27;s law, this volume is the same for all ideal gases, which is 22.414 liters at standard temperature and pressure. The number of atoms contained in this volume is referred to as the Avogadro number, and the determination of this number is tantamount to the knowledge of the mass of an atom, since the latter is obtained by dividing the molar mass of the gas by the Avogadro constant.

The first part of Einstein&#x27;s argument was to determine how far a Brownian particle travels in a given time interval. Classical mechanics is unable to determine this distance because of the enormous number of bombardments a Brownian particle will undergo, roughly of the order of 1014 collisions per second.

He regarded the increment of particle positions in time formula_1 in a one-dimensional (&quot;x&quot;) space (with the coordinates chosen so that the origin lies at the initial position of the particle) as a random variable (formula_2) with some probability density function formula_3 (i.e., formula_4 is the probability density for a jump of magnitude formula_2, i.e., the probability density of the particle incrementing its position from formula_6 to formula_7 in the time interval formula_1). Further, assuming conservation of particle number, he expanded the number density formula_9 (number of particles per unit volume around formula_6) at time formula_11 in a Taylor series,
formula_12
where the second equality is by definition of formula_13. The integral in the first term is equal to one by the definition of probability, and the second and other even terms (i.e. first and other odd moments) vanish because of space symmetry. What is left gives rise to the following relation:
formula_14
Where the coefficient after the Laplacian, the second moment of probability of displacement formula_2, is interpreted as mass diffusivity &quot;D&quot;:
formula_16
Then the density of Brownian particles at point at time satisfies the diffusion equation:
formula_17

Assuming that &quot;N&quot; particles start from the origin at the initial time &quot;t&quot; = 0, the diffusion equation has the solution
formula_18
This expression (which is a normal distribution with the mean formula_19 and variance formula_20 usually called Brownian motion formula_21) allowed Einstein to calculate the moments directly. The first moment is seen to vanish, meaning that the Brownian particle is equally likely to move to the left as it is to move to the right. The second moment is, however, non-vanishing, being given by
formula_22
This equation expresses the mean squared displacement in terms of the time elapsed and the diffusivity. From this expression Einstein argued that the displacement of a Brownian particle is not proportional to the elapsed time, but rather to its square root. His argument is based on a conceptual switch from the &quot;ensemble&quot; of Brownian particles to the &quot;single&quot; Brownian particle: we can speak of the relative number of particles at a single instant just as well as of the time it takes a Brownian particle to reach a given point.

The second part of Einstein&#x27;s theory relates the diffusion constant to physically measurable quantities, such as the mean squared displacement of a particle in a given time interval. This result enables the experimental determination of the Avogadro number and therefore the size of molecules. Einstein analyzed a dynamic equilibrium being established between opposing forces. The beauty of his argument is that the final result does not depend upon which forces are involved in setting up the dynamic equilibrium.

In his original treatment, Einstein considered an osmotic pressure experiment, but the same conclusion can be reached in other ways.

Consider, for instance, particles suspended in a viscous fluid in a gravitational field. Gravity tends to make the particles settle, whereas diffusion acts to homogenize them, driving them into regions of smaller concentration. Under the action of gravity, a particle acquires a downward speed of , where is the mass of the particle, is the acceleration due to gravity, and is the particle&#x27;s mobility in the fluid. George Stokes had shown that the mobility for a spherical particle with radius is formula_23, where is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid. In a state of dynamic equilibrium, and under the hypothesis of isothermal fluid, the particles are distributed according to the barometric distribution
formula_24
where is the difference in density of particles separated by a height difference, of formula_25, is the Boltzmann constant (the ratio of the universal gas constant, , to the Avogadro constant, ), and is the absolute temperature.

Dynamic equilibrium is established because the more that particles are pulled down by gravity, the greater the tendency for the particles to migrate to regions of lower concentration. The flux is given by Fick&#x27;s law,
formula_26
where . Introducing the formula for , we find that
formula_27

In a state of dynamical equilibrium, this speed must also be equal to . Both expressions for are proportional to , reflecting that the derivation is independent of the type of forces considered. Similarly, one can derive an equivalent formula for identical charged particles of charge in a uniform electric field of magnitude , where is replaced with the electrostatic force . Equating these two expressions yields the Einstein relation for the diffusivity, independent of or or other such forces:
formula_28
Here the first equality follows from the first part of Einstein&#x27;s theory, the third equality follows from the definition of the Boltzmann constant as , and the fourth equality follows from Stokes&#x27;s formula for the mobility. By measuring the mean squared displacement over a time interval along with the universal gas constant , the temperature , the viscosity , and the particle radius , the Avogadro constant can be determined.

The type of dynamical equilibrium proposed by Einstein was not new. It had been pointed out previously by J. J. Thomson in his series of lectures at Yale University in May 1903 that the dynamic equilibrium between the velocity generated by a concentration gradient given by Fick&#x27;s law and the velocity due to the variation of the partial pressure caused when ions are set in motion &quot;gives us a method of determining Avogadro&#x27;s constant which is independent of any hypothesis as to the shape or size of molecules, or of the way in which they act upon each other&quot;.

An identical expression to Einstein&#x27;s formula for the diffusion coefficient was also found by Walther Nernst in 1888 in which he expressed the diffusion coefficient as the ratio of the osmotic pressure to the ratio of the frictional force and the velocity to which it gives rise. The former was equated to the law of van &#x27;t Hoff while the latter was given by Stokes&#x27;s law. He writes formula_29 for the diffusion coefficient , where formula_30 is the osmotic pressure and is the ratio of the frictional force to the molecular viscosity which he assumes is given by Stokes&#x27;s formula for the viscosity. Introducing the ideal gas law per unit volume for the osmotic pressure, the formula becomes identical to that of Einstein&#x27;s. The use of Stokes&#x27;s law in Nernst&#x27;s case, as well as in Einstein and Smoluchowski, is not strictly applicable since it does not apply to the case where the radius of the sphere is small in comparison with the mean free path.

At first, the predictions of Einstein&#x27;s formula were seemingly refuted by a series of experiments by Svedberg in 1906 and 1907, which gave displacements of the particles as 4 to 6 times the predicted value, and by Henri in 1908 who found displacements 3 times greater than Einstein&#x27;s formula predicted. But Einstein&#x27;s predictions were finally confirmed in a series of experiments carried out by Chaudesaigues in 1908 and Perrin in 1909. The confirmation of Einstein&#x27;s theory constituted empirical progress for the kinetic theory of heat. In essence, Einstein showed that the motion can be predicted directly from the kinetic model of thermal equilibrium. The importance of the theory lay in the fact that it confirmed the kinetic theory&#x27;s account of the second law of thermodynamics as being an essentially statistical law.

===Smoluchowski model===

Smoluchowski&#x27;s theory of Brownian motion starts from the same premise as that of Einstein and derives the same probability distribution for the displacement of a Brownian particle along the in time . He therefore gets the same expression for the mean squared displacement: However, when he relates it to a particle of mass moving at a velocity which is the result of a frictional force governed by Stokes&#x27;s law, he finds
formula_31
where is the viscosity coefficient, and is the radius of the particle. Associating the kinetic energy formula_32 with the thermal energy , the expression for the mean squared displacement is times that found by Einstein. The fraction 27/64 was commented on by Arnold Sommerfeld in his necrology on Smoluchowski: &quot;The numerical coefficient of Einstein, which differs from Smoluchowski by 27/64 can only be put in doubt.&quot;

Smoluchowski attempts to answer the question of why a Brownian particle should be displaced by bombardments of smaller particles when the probabilities for striking it in the forward and rear directions are equal.
If the probability of gains and losses follows a binomial distribution,
formula_33
with equal probabilities of 1/2, the mean total gain is
formula_34

If is large enough so that Stirling&#x27;s approximation can be used in the form
formula_35
then the expected total gain will be
formula_36
showing that it increases as the square root of the total population.

Suppose that a Brownian particle of mass is surrounded by lighter particles of mass which are traveling at a speed . Then, reasons Smoluchowski, in any collision between a surrounding and Brownian particles, the velocity transmitted to the latter will be . This ratio is of the order of . But we also have to take into consideration that in a gas there will be more than 1016 collisions in a second, and even greater in a liquid where we expect that there will be 1020 collision in one second. Some of these collisions will tend to accelerate the Brownian particle; others will tend to decelerate it. If there is a mean excess of one kind of collision or the other to be of the order of 108 to 1010 collisions in one second, then velocity of the Brownian particle may be anywhere between . Thus, even though there are equal probabilities for forward and backward collisions there will be a net tendency to keep the Brownian particle in motion, just as the ballot theorem predicts.

These orders of magnitude are not exact because they don&#x27;t take into consideration the velocity of the Brownian particle, , which depends on the collisions that tend to accelerate and decelerate it. The larger is, the greater will be the collisions that will retard it so that the velocity of a Brownian particle can never increase without limit. Could such a process occur, it would be tantamount to a perpetual motion of the second type. And since equipartition of energy applies, the kinetic energy of the Brownian particle, will be equal, on the average, to the kinetic energy of the surrounding fluid particle, 

In 1906 Smoluchowski published a one-dimensional model to describe a particle undergoing Brownian motion. The model assumes collisions with where is the test particle&#x27;s mass and the mass of one of the individual particles composing the fluid. It is assumed that the particle collisions are confined to one dimension and that it is equally probable for the test particle to be hit from the left as from the right. It is also assumed that every collision always imparts the same magnitude of . If is the number of collisions from the right and the number of collisions from the left then after collisions the particle&#x27;s velocity will have changed by . The multiplicity is then simply given by:
formula_37
and the total number of possible states is given by . Therefore, the probability of the particle being hit from the right times is:
formula_38

As a result of its simplicity, Smoluchowski&#x27;s 1D model can only qualitatively describe Brownian motion. For a realistic particle undergoing Brownian motion in a fluid, many of the assumptions don&#x27;t apply. For example, the assumption that on average occurs an equal number of collisions from the right as from the left falls apart once the particle is in motion. Also, there would be a distribution of different possible s instead of always just one in a realistic situation.

===Langevin equation===

The diffusion equation yields an approximation of the time evolution of the probability density function associated with the position of the particle going under a Brownian movement under the physical definition. The approximation is valid on short timescales.
The time evolution of the position of the Brownian particle over all time scales described using the Langevin equation, an equation that involves a random force field representing the effect of the thermal fluctuations of the solvent on the particle. In Langevin dynamics and Brownian dynamics, the Langevin equation is used to efficiently simulate the dynamics of molecular systems that exhibit a strong Brownian component.

===Astrophysics: star motion within galaxies===

In stellar dynamics, a massive body (star, black hole, etc.) can experience Brownian motion as it responds to gravitational forces from surrounding stars. The rms velocity of the massive object, of mass , is related to the rms velocity formula_39 of the background stars by
formula_40
where formula_41 is the mass of the background stars. The gravitational force from the massive object causes nearby stars to move faster than they otherwise would, increasing both formula_39 and . The Brownian velocity of Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy, is predicted from this formula to be less than 1Â kmÂ sâ1.

==Mathematics==

In mathematics, Brownian motion is described by the Wiener process, a continuous-time stochastic process named in honor of Norbert Wiener. It is one of the best known LÃ©vy processes (cÃ dlÃ g stochastic processes with stationary independent increments) and occurs frequently in pure and applied mathematics, economics and physics.
The Wiener process is characterized by four facts:
# is almost surely continuous
# has independent increments
# formula_43 
formula_44 denotes the normal distribution with expected value and variance . The condition that it has independent increments means that if formula_45 then formula_46 and formula_47 are independent random variables. In addition, for some filtration formula_48 is formula_49 measurable for all 

An alternative characterisation of the Wiener process is the so-called &quot;LÃ©vy characterisation&quot; that says that the Wiener process is an almost surely continuous martingale with and quadratic variation 

A third characterisation is that the Wiener process has a spectral representation as a sine series whose coefficients are independent formula_50 random variables. This representation can be obtained using the KosambiâKarhunenâLoÃ¨ve theorem.

The Wiener process can be constructed as the scaling limit of a random walk, or other discrete-time stochastic processes with stationary independent increments. This is known as Donsker&#x27;s theorem. Like the random walk, the Wiener process is recurrent in one or two dimensions (meaning that it returns almost surely to any fixed neighborhood of the origin infinitely often) whereas it is not recurrent in dimensions three and higher. Unlike the random walk, it is scale invariant.
A d-dimensional Gaussian free field has been described as &quot;a d-dimensional-time analog of Brownian motion.&quot;

===Statistics===

The Brownian motion can be modeled by a random walk.

In the general case, Brownian motion is a Markov process and described by stochastic integral equations.

===LÃ©vy characterisation===

The French mathematician Paul LÃ©vy proved the following theorem, which gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a continuous -valued stochastic process to actually be -dimensional Brownian motion. Hence, LÃ©vy&#x27;s condition can actually be used as an alternative definition of Brownian motion.

Let be a continuous stochastic process on a probability space taking values in . Then the following are equivalent:

# is a Brownian motion with respect to , i.e., the law of with respect to is the same as the law of an -dimensional Brownian motion, i.e., the push-forward measure is classical Wiener measure on .
# both
## is a martingale with respect to (and its own natural filtration); and
## for all , is a martingale with respect to (and its own natural filtration), where denotes the Kronecker delta.

===Spectral content===

The spectral content of a stochastic process formula_51 can be found from the power spectral density, formally defined as
formula_52
where formula_53 stands for the expected value. The power spectral density of Brownian motion is found to be
formula_54
where is the diffusion coefficient of . For naturally occurring signals, the spectral content can be found from the power spectral density of a single realization, with finite available time, i.e.,
formula_55
which for an individual realization of a Brownian motion trajectory, it is found to have expected value formula_56
formula_57
and variance formula_58
formula_59

For sufficiently long realization times, the expected value of the power spectrum of a single trajectory converges to the formally defined power spectral density but its coefficient of variation formula_60 tends to This implies the distribution of formula_61 is broad even in the infinite time limit.

===Riemannian manifold===


The infinitesimal generator (and hence characteristic operator) of a Brownian motion on is easily calculated to be , where denotes the Laplace operator. In image processing and computer vision, the Laplacian operator has been used for various tasks such as blob and edge detection. This observation is useful in defining Brownian motion on an -dimensional Riemannian manifold : a Brownian motion on is defined to be a diffusion on whose characteristic operator formula_62 in local coordinates , , is given by , where is the LaplaceâBeltrami operator given in local coordinates by
formula_63
where in the sense of the inverse of a square matrix.

==Narrow escape==

The narrow escape problem is a ubiquitous problem in biology, biophysics and cellular biology which has the following formulation: a Brownian particle (ion, molecule, or protein) is confined to a bounded domain (a compartment or a cell) by a reflecting boundary, except for a small window through which it can escape. The narrow escape problem is that of calculating the mean escape time. This time diverges as the window shrinks, thus rendering the calculation a singular perturbation problem.

<text>Barcelona ( ; ; ) is a city on the northeastern coast of Spain. It is the capital and largest city of the autonomous community of Catalonia, as well as the second-most populous municipality of Spain. With a population of 1.6 million within city limits, its urban area extends to numerous neighbouring municipalities within the province of Barcelona and is home to around 5.3 million people, making it the fifth most populous urban area of the European Union after Paris, the Ruhr area, Madrid and Milan. It is one of the largest metropolises on the Mediterranean Sea, located on the coast between the mouths of the rivers Llobregat and BesÃ²s, bounded to the west by the Serra de Collserola mountain range.

According to tradition, Barcelona was founded by either the Phoenicians or the Carthaginians, who had trading posts along the Catalonian coast. In the Middle Ages, Barcelona became the capital of the County of Barcelona. After joining with the Kingdom of Aragon to form the confederation of the Crown of Aragon, Barcelona, which continued to be the capital of the Principality of Catalonia, became the most important city in the Crown of Aragon and the main economic and administrative centre of the Crown, only to be overtaken by Valencia, wrested from Moorish control by the Catalans, shortly before the dynastic union between the Crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon in 1492. Barcelona became the centre of Catalan separatism, briefly becoming part of France during the 17th century Reapers&#x27; War and again in 1812 until 1814 under Napoleon. It was the capital of Revolutionary Catalonia during the Spanish Revolution of 1936, and the seat of government of the Second Spanish Republic later in the Spanish Civil War, until its capture by the fascists in 1939. After the Spanish transition to democracy in the 1970s, Barcelona once again became the capital of an autonomous Catalonia.

Barcelona has a rich cultural heritage and is today an important cultural centre and a major tourist destination. Particularly renowned are the architectural works of Antoni GaudÃ­ and LluÃ­s DomÃ¨nech i Montaner, which have been designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The city is home to two of the most prestigious universities in Spain: the University of Barcelona and Pompeu Fabra University. The headquarters of the Union for the Mediterranean are located in Barcelona. The city is known for hosting the 1992 Summer Olympics as well as world-class conferences and expositions. In addition, many international sport tournaments have been played here.

Barcelona is a major cultural, economic, and financial centre in southwestern Europe, as well as the main biotech hub in Spain. As a leading world city, Barcelona&#x27;s influence in global socio-economic affairs qualifies it for global city status (Beta +).

Barcelona is a transport hub, with the Port of Barcelona being one of Europe&#x27;s principal seaports and busiest European passenger port, an international airport, BarcelonaâEl Prat Airport, which handles over 50-million passengers per year, an extensive motorway network, and a high-speed rail line with a link to France and the rest of Europe.

== Names ==
The name &quot;Barcelona&quot; comes from the ancient Iberian &quot;BaÅkeno&quot;, attested in an ancient coin inscription found on the right side of the coin in Iberian script as , in Ancient Greek sources as , &quot;Barkiná¹n&quot;; and in Latin as &quot;Barcino&quot;, &quot;Barcilonum&quot; and &quot;Barcenona&quot;.

Other sources suggest that the city may have been named after the Carthaginian general Hamilcar Barca, who was supposed to have founded the city in the 3rd century BC, but there is no evidence its name in antiquity, &quot;Barcino&quot;, was connected with the Barcid family of Hamilcar. During the Middle Ages, the city was variously known as &quot;Barchinona&quot;, &quot;BarÃ§alona&quot;, &quot;Barchelonaa&quot;, and &quot;Barchenona&quot;.

An abbreviated form sometimes used by locals for the city is &quot;Barna&quot;. &quot;BarÃ§a&quot; is only applied to the local football club FC Barcelona, not to the city. Another common abbreviation is &#x27;BCN&#x27;, which is also the IATA airport code of the Barcelona-El Prat Airport.

The city is referred to as the &quot;Ciutat Comtal&quot; in Catalan and &quot;Ciudad Condal&quot; in Spanish (i.e., &quot;Comital City&quot; or &quot;City of Counts&quot;), owing to its past as the seat of the Count of Barcelona.

== History ==

=== Legendary founding ===
The origin of the earliest settlement at the site of present-day Barcelona is unclear. The ruins of an early settlement have been found, including different tombs and dwellings dating to earlier than 5000 BC. In Greek mythology, the founding of Barcelona had been attributed to the mythological Hercules.

=== Punic Barcelona ===
According to tradition, Barcelona was founded by Punic (Phoenician) settlers, who had trading posts along the Catalonian coast. In particular, some historians attribute the foundation of the city directly to the historical Carthaginian general, Hamilcar Barca, father of Hannibal, who supposedly named the city &quot;Barcino&quot; after his family in the 3rd century BC, but this theory has been questioned. Archeological evidence in the form of coins from the 3rd century BC have been found on the hills at the foot of MontjuÃ¯c with the name BÃ¡rkeno written in an ancient script in the Iberian language. Thus, we can conclude that the Laietani, an ancient Iberian (pre-Roman) people of the Iberian peninsula, who inhabited the area occupied by the city of Barcelona around 3â2 BC, called the area BÃ rkeno, which means &quot;The Place of the Plains&quot; (Barrke = plains/terrace).

=== Roman Barcelona ===
In about 15Â BC, the Romans redrew the town as a &quot;castrum&quot; (Roman military camp) centred on the &quot;Mons Taber&quot;, a little hill near the Generalitat (Catalan Government) and city hall buildings. The Roman Forum, at the crossing of the Cardo Maximus and Decumanus Maximus, was approximately placed where current PlaÃ§a de Sant Jaume is. Thus, the political centre of the city, Catalonia, and its domains has remained in the same place for over 2,000 years.

Under the Romans, it was a colony with the surname of &quot;Faventia&quot;, or, in full, &quot;Colonia Faventia Julia Augusta Pia Barcino&quot; or &quot;Colonia Julia Augusta Faventia Paterna Barcino&quot;. Pomponius Mela mentions it among the small towns of the district, probably as it was eclipsed by its neighbour &quot;Tarraco&quot; (modern Tarragona), but it may be gathered from later writers that it gradually grew in wealth and consequence, favoured as it was with a beautiful situation and an excellent harbour. It enjoyed immunity from imperial burdens. The city minted its own coins; some from the era of Galba survive.

Important Roman vestiges are displayed in PlaÃ§a del Rei underground, as a part of the Barcelona City History Museum (MUHBA); the typically Roman grid plan is still visible today in the layout of the historical centre, the &quot;Barri GÃ²tic&quot; (Gothic Quarter). Some remaining fragments of the Roman walls have been incorporated into the cathedral. The cathedral, Catedral BasÃ­lica Metropolitana de Barcelona, is also sometimes called &quot;La Seu&quot;, which simply means cathedral (and see, among other things) in Catalan. It is said to have been founded in 343.

=== Medieval Barcelona ===
The city was conquered by the Visigoths in the early 5th century, becoming for a few years the capital of all Hispania. After being conquered by the Umayyads in the early 8th century, it was conquered after a siege in 801 by Charlemagne&#x27;s son Louis, who made Barcelona the seat of the Carolingian &quot;Hispanic March&quot; (&quot;Marca Hispanica&quot;), a buffer zone ruled by the Count of Barcelona.
The Counts of Barcelona became increasingly independent and expanded their territory to include much of modern Catalonia, although in 985, Barcelona was sacked by the army of Almanzor. The sack was so traumatic that most of Barcelona&#x27;s population was either killed or enslaved. In 1137, Aragon and the County of Barcelona merged in dynastic union by the marriage of Ramon Berenguer IV and Petronilla of Aragon, their titles finally borne by only one person when their son Alfonso II of Aragon ascended to the throne in 1162. His territories were later to be known as the Crown of Aragon, which conquered many overseas possessions and ruled the western Mediterranean Sea with outlying territories in Naples and Sicily and as far as Athens in the 13th century.

Barcelona also had a substantial Jewish community at the time, then the largest Jewish community in the Crown of Aragon. Called &quot;the Call,&quot; for the many small streets that defined the area, it later became enclosed. MontjuÃ¯c or Montjuich, in medieval Latin and Catalan, meaning &quot;Jewish Mountain&quot; and the birthplace of the city, is the site of a medieval Jewish cemetery, Jews continued to live in Barcelona until the Massacre of 1391 diminished their numbers. The Spanish Inquisition forced the remaining Jews who refused to convert to Christianity to be burned at the stake, or sell their property and leave. 

Barcelona was the leading slave trade centre of the Crown of Aragon up until the 15th century, when it was eclipsed by Valencia. It initially fed from eastern and Balkan slave stock later drawing from a Maghribian and, ultimately, Subsaharan pool of slaves.

The Bank or Taula de canvi de Barcelona, often viewed as the oldest public bank in Europe, was established by the city magistrates in 1401. It originated from necessities of the state, as did the Bank of Venice (1402) and the Bank of Genoa (1407).

=== Barcelona under the Spanish monarchy ===

In the beginning of the Early Modern period, Barcelona lost political primacy, but the economy managed to achieve a balance between production capacity and imports.

In the context of the wider early recovery of Catalonia from the 17th-century crisis in the second half of the century, increasing maritime activity since 1675 doubled traffic in the port of Barcelona compared to figures from the beginning of the 17th century.

In the late 17th and early 18th century, Barcelona repeatedly endured the effects of war, including the 1691 bombing, the sieges of 1697, 1704, 1705, 1706, and the 1713 blockade and ensuing 1714 siege and assault.

In the 18th century, the population grew from 30,000 to about 100,000 inhabitants, as the city became one of the key mercantile centres in the Western Mediterranean, with inland influence up to Zaragoza, and to the south up to Alicante. A fortress was built at MontjuÃ¯c that overlooked the harbour.

Much of Barcelona was negatively affected by the Napoleonic wars, but the start of industrialization saw the fortunes of the province improve.

=== Transforming the city ===
In the mid-1850s, Barcelona was struggling with population density as it became an industrial, port city and European capital. The city&#x27;s density was at 856 people per hectare, more than double that of Paris. Mortality rates were on the rise and any outbreaks of disease would devastate the population. To solve the issue, a civil engineer named Ildefons CerdÃ  proposed a plan for a new district known as the Eixample. The citizens of Barcelona had begun to demolish the medieval wall surrounding and constricting the city. CerdÃ  thought it best to transform the land outside the walls into an area characterized by a scientific approach to urbanization. His proposal consisted of a grid of streets to unite the old city and surrounding villages. There would also be wide streets to allow people to breathe clean air, gardens in the centre of each street block, integration of rich and poor giving both groups access to the same services, and smooth-flowing traffic. Urban quality, egalitarianism, hygiene, sunlight, and efficiency were all major keys for CerdÃ &#x27;s vision. Not everything he imagined would be realized within the Eixample district, but the iconic octagonal superblocks with chamfered corners for better visibility are his direct brainchild and remain immensely helpful even 170 years later. The district and its ideals were not appreciated at the time. The city council awarded the design of the extension plan to another architect. The Spanish government was the one to step in and impose CerdÃ &#x27;s plan, laying the groundwork for many more tensions between the Spanish and Catalan administrations. Regardless, some of the upper class citizens of Barcelona were excited by the new plan and began a race to build &quot;the biggest, tallest, most attractive house&quot; in the district. Their interest and money fueled the rich diversity that we now see in the district&#x27;s architecture. In the end, CerdÃ &#x27;s ideas would have a lasting impact on Barcelona&#x27;s development, earning it international recognition for its highly efficient approach to urban planning and design.

=== The Spanish Civil War and the Franco period ===
During the Spanish Civil War, the city, and Catalonia in general, were resolutely Republican. Many enterprises and public services were collectivized by the CNT and UGT unions. As the power of the Republican government and the Generalitat diminished, much of the city was under the effective control of anarchist groups. The anarchists lost control of the city to their own allies, the Communists and official government troops, after the street fighting of the Barcelona May Days. The fall of the city on 26 January 1939, caused a mass exodus of civilians who fled to the French border. The resistance of Barcelona to Franco&#x27;s &quot;coup d&#x27;Ã©tat&quot; was to have lasting effects after the defeat of the Republican government. The autonomous institutions of Catalonia were abolished, and the use of the Catalan language in public life was suppressed. Barcelona remained the second largest city in Spain, at the heart of a region which was relatively industrialized and prosperous, despite the devastation of the civil war. The result was a large-scale immigration from poorer regions of Spain (particularly Andalusia, Murcia and Galicia), which in turn led to rapid urbanization.

=== Late twentieth century ===
In 1992, Barcelona hosted the Summer Olympics. The after-effects of this are credited with driving major changes in what had, up until then, been a largely industrial city. As part of the preparation for the games, industrial buildings along the sea-front were demolished and of beach were created. New construction increased the road capacity of the city by 17%, the sewage handling capacity by 27% and the amount of new green areas and beaches by 78%. Between 1990 and 2004, the number of hotel rooms in the city doubled. Perhaps more importantly, the outside perception of the city was changed making, by 2012, Barcelona the 12th most popular city destination in the world and the 5th amongst European cities.

=== Recent history ===

The death of Franco in 1975 brought on a period of democratization throughout Spain. Pressure for change was particularly strong in Barcelona, which considered that it had been punished during nearly forty years of Francoism for its support of the Republican government. Massive, but peaceful, demonstrations on 11 September 1977 assembled over a million people in the streets of Barcelona to call for the restoration of Catalan autonomy. It was granted less than a month later.

The development of Barcelona was promoted by two events in 1986: Spanish accession to the European Community, and particularly Barcelona&#x27;s designation as host city of the 1992 Summer Olympics. The process of urban regeneration has been rapid, and accompanied by a greatly increased international reputation of the city as a tourist destination. The increased cost of housing has led to a slight decline (â16.6%) in the population over the last two decades of the 20th century as many families move out into the suburbs. This decline has been reversed since 2001, as a new wave of immigration (particularly from Latin America and from Morocco) has gathered pace.

In 1987, an ETA car bombing at Hipercor killed 21 people. On 17 August 2017, a van was driven into pedestrians on La Rambla, killing 14 and injuring at least 100, one of whom later died. Other attacks took place elsewhere in Catalonia. The Prime Minister of Spain, Mariano Rajoy, called the attack in Barcelona a jihadist attack. Amaq News Agency attributed indirect responsibility for the attack to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). During the 2010s, Barcelona became the focus city for the ongoing Catalan independence movement, its consequent standoff between the regional and national government and later protests.

In July 2023, Barcelona was announced as the UNESCO-UIA World Capital of Architecture for the 2024â2026 term. This means it will be the hub for discussion around global challenges including culture, heritage, urban planning and architecture. In addition to being the capital through 2026, it will also host the UIA World Congress of Architects for that year. The honour is befitting of Barcelona, as its history is peppered with architectural achievement and various iconic styles and influences. From its ancient Roman roots, to the Gothic and Modernisme movements, Barcelona has thrived through the way it ties together architecture and culture.

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
Barcelona is located on the northeast coast of the Iberian Peninsula, facing the Mediterranean Sea, on a plain approximately wide limited by the mountain range of Collserola, the Llobregat river to the southwest and the BesÃ²s river to the north. This plain covers an area of , of which are occupied by the city itself. It is south of the Pyrenees and the Catalan border with France.

Tibidabo, high, offers striking views over the city and is topped by the Torre de Collserola, a telecommunications tower that is visible from most of the city. Barcelona is peppered with small hills, most of them urbanized, that gave their name to the neighbourhoods built upon them, such as Carmel (), Putxet (es) () and Rovira (). The escarpment of MontjuÃ¯c (), situated to the southeast, overlooks the harbour and is topped by MontjuÃ¯c Castle, a fortress built in the 17â18th centuries to control the city as a replacement for the Ciutadella. Today, the fortress is a museum and MontjuÃ¯c is home to several sporting and cultural venues, as well as Barcelona&#x27;s biggest park and gardens.

The city borders on the municipalities of Santa Coloma de Gramenet and Sant AdriÃ  de BesÃ²s to the north; the Mediterranean Sea to the east; El Prat de Llobregat and L&#x27;Hospitalet de Llobregat to the south; and Sant Feliu de Llobregat, Sant Just Desvern, Esplugues de Llobregat, Sant Cugat del VallÃ¨s, and Montcada i Reixac to the west. The municipality includes two small sparsely-inhabited exclaves to the north-west.

=== Climate ===

According to the KÃ¶ppen climate classification, Barcelona has a hot summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;), with mild winters and warm to hot summers, while the rainiest seasons are autumn and spring. The rainfall pattern is characterized by a short (3 months) dry season in summer, as well as less winter rainfall than in a typical Mediterranean climate. However, both June and August are wetter than February, which is unusual for the Mediterranean climate. This subtype, labelled as &quot;Portuguese&quot; by the French geographer George Viers after the climate classification of Emmanuel de Martonne and found in the NW Mediterranean area (e.g. Marseille), can be seen as transitional to the humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) found in inland areas.

Barcelona is densely populated, thus heavily influenced by the urban heat island effect. Areas outside of the urbanized districts can have as much as 2Â Â°C of difference in temperatures throughout the year. Its average annual temperature is during the day and at night. The average annual temperature of the sea is about . In the coldest month, January, the temperature typically ranges from during the day, at night and the average sea temperature is . In the warmest month, August, the typical temperature ranges from during the day, about at night and the average sea temperature is . Generally, the summer or &quot;holiday&quot; season lasts about six months, from May to October. Two months â April and November â are transitional; sometimes the temperature exceeds , with an average temperature of during the day and at night. December, January and February are the coldest months, with average temperatures around during the day and at night. Large fluctuations in temperature are rare, particularly in the summer months. Because of the proximity to the warm sea plus the urban heat island, frosts are very rare in the city of Barcelona. Snow is also very infrequent in the city of Barcelona, but light snowfalls can occur yearly in the nearby Collserola mountains, such as in the Fabra Observatory located in a nearby mountain.

Barcelona averages 78 rainy days per year (â¥ 1Â mm), and annual average relative humidity is 72%, ranging from 69% in July to 75% in October. Rainfall totals are highest in late summer and autumn (SeptemberâNovember) and lowest in early and mid-summer (JuneâAugust), with a secondary winter minimum (FebruaryâMarch). Sunshine duration is 2,524Â hours per year, from 138 (average 4.5Â hours of sunshine a day) in December to 310 (average 10Â hours of sunshine a day) in July.


== Demographics ==
According to Barcelona&#x27;s City Council, the city&#x27;s population was 1,608,746Â people, on a land area of . It is the main component of an administrative area of Greater Barcelona, with a population of 3,218,071 in an area of (density 5,060 inhabitants/km2). The population of the urban area was 4,840,000. It is the central nucleus of the Barcelona metropolitan area, which relies on a population of 5,474,482.

In 1900, Barcelona had a population of 533,000, which grew steadily but slowly until 1950, when it started absorbing a high number of people from other less-industrialized parts of Spain. Barcelona&#x27;s population peaked in 1979 at 1,906,998, and fell throughout the 1980s and 1990s as more people sought a higher quality of life in outlying cities in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area. After bottoming out in 2000 with 1,496,266 residents, the city&#x27;s population began to rise again as younger people started to return, causing a great increase in housing prices.

=== Languages spoken ===
Spanish is the most spoken language in Barcelona (according to the linguistic census held by the Government of Catalonia in 2013) and it is understood almost universally. Catalan is also very commonly spoken in the city: it is understood by 95% of the population, while 72.3% can speak it, 79% can read it, and 53% can write it. Knowledge of Catalan has increased significantly in recent decades thanks to a language immersion educational system.

After Catalan and Spanish, the most spoken languages in Barcelona are those from North Africa, such as Amazigh and Arabic, followed by Bengali, Urdu, Panjabi, Mandarin Chinese, Romanian, English, Russian and Quechua, according to data collected by the University of Barcelona.

=== Population density ===

Barcelona is one of the most densely populated cities in Europe. For the year 2008 the city council calculated the population to 1,621,090 living in the 102.2Â km2 sized municipality, giving the city an average population density of 15,926 inhabitants per square kilometre with Eixample being the most populated district.

In the case of Barcelona though, the land distribution is extremely uneven. Half of the municipality or 50.2Â km2, all of it located on the municipal edge is made up of the ten least densely populated neighbourhoods containing less than 10% of the city&#x27;s population, the uninhabited Zona Franca industrial area and MontjuÃ¯c forest park. Leaving the remaining 90% or slightly below 1.5Â million inhabitants living on the remaining at an average density close to 28,500 inhabitants per square kilometre.

Of the 73 neighbourhoods in the city, 45 had a population density above 20,000 inhabitants per square kilometre with a combined population of 1,313,424 inhabitants living on 38.6Â km2 at an average density of 33,987 inhabitants per square kilometre. The 30 most densely populated neighbourhoods accounted for 57.5% of the city population occupying only 22.7% of the municipality, or in other words, 936,406 people living at an average density of 40,322 inhabitants per square kilometre. The city&#x27;s highest density is found at and around the neighbourhood of la Sagrada FamÃ­lia where four of the city&#x27;s most densely populated neighbourhoods are located side by side, all with a population density above 50,000 inhabitants per square kilometre.

=== Age structure ===
In 1900, almost a third (28.9 percent) of the population were children (aged younger than 14 years). In 2017, this age group constituted only 12.7% of the population. In 2017, people aged between 15 and 24 years made up 9 percent of the population; those aged between 25 and 44 years made up 30.6 percent of the population; while those aged between 45 and 64 years formed 56.9% of all Barcelonans. In 1900, people aged 65 and older made up just 6.5 percent of the population. In 2017, this age group made up 21.5 percent of the population.

=== Migration ===
In 2016, about 59% of the inhabitants of the city were born in Catalonia and 18.5% coming from the rest of the country. In addition to that, 22.5% of the population was born outside of Spain, a proportion which has more than doubled since 2001 and more than quintupled since 1996 when it was 8.6% and 3.9% respectively.

The most important region of origin of migrants is Europe, with many coming from Italy (26,676) or France (13,506). Moreover, many migrants come from Latin American nations such as Bolivia, Ecuador or Colombia. Since the 1990s, and similar to other migrants, many Latin Americans have settled in northern parts of the city.

There exists a relatively large Pakistani community in Barcelona with up to twenty thousand nationals. The community consists of significantly more men than women. Many of the Pakistanis are living in Ciutat Vella. First Pakistani migrants came in the 1970s, with increasing numbers in the 1990s.

Other significant migrant groups come from Asia as from China and the Philippines. There is a Japanese community clustered in Bonanova, Les Tres Torres, Pedralbes, and other northern neighbourhoods, and a Japanese international school serves that community.

=== Religion ===
In 2007, most of the inhabitants stated they are Roman Catholic (208Â churches). In a 2011 survey conducted by InfoCatÃ³lica, 49.5% of Barcelona residents of all ages identified themselves as Catholic. This was the first time that more than half of respondents did not identify themselves as Catholic Christians. The numbers reflect a broader trend in Spain whereby the numbers of self-identified Catholics have declined. In 2019, a survey by Centro de Investigaciones SociolÃ³gicas showed that 53.2% of residents in Barcelona identified themselves as Catholic (9.9% practising Catholics, 43.3% non-practising Catholics).

The province has the largest Muslim community in Spain, 322,698 people in Barcelona province are of Muslim religion. A considerable number of Muslims live in Barcelona due to immigration (169Â locations, mostly professed by Moroccans in Spain). In 2014, 322,698 out of 5.5Â million people in the province of Barcelona identified themselves as Muslim, which makes 5.6% of the total population.

The city also has the largest Jewish community in Spain, with an estimated 3,500 Jews living in the city. There are also a number of other groups, including Evangelical (71Â locations, mostly professed by Roma), Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses (21Â Kingdom Halls), Buddhists (13Â locations), and Eastern Orthodox.

== Economy ==
=== General information ===
The Barcelona metropolitan area comprises over 66% of the people of Catalonia, one of the richer regions in Europe and the fourth richest region per capita in Spain, with a GDP per capita amounting to â¬28,400 (16% more than the EU average). The greater Barcelona metropolitan area had a GDP amounting to $177Â billion (equivalent to $34,821 in per capita terms, 44% more than the EU average), making it the 4th most economically powerful city by gross GDP in the European Union, and 35th in the world in 2009. Barcelona city had a very high GDP of â¬80,894 per head in 2004, according to Eurostat. Furthermore, Barcelona was Europe&#x27;s fourth best business city and fastest improving European city, with growth improved by 17% per year .

Barcelona was the 24th most &quot;livable city&quot; in the world in 2015 according to lifestyle magazine &quot;Monocle&quot;. Similarly, according to Innovation Analysts 2thinknow, Barcelona occupies 13th place in the world on &quot;Innovation Citiesâ¢ Global Index&quot;. At the same time it is according to the Global Wealth and Lifestyle Report 2020 one of the most affordable cities in the world for a luxury lifestyle.

Barcelona has a long-standing mercantile tradition. Less well known is that the city industrialized early, taking off in 1833, when Catalonia&#x27;s already sophisticated textile industry began to use steam power. It became the first and most important industrial city in the Mediterranean basin. Since then, manufacturing has played a large role in its history.

Borsa de Barcelona (Barcelona Stock Exchange) is the main stock exchange in the northeastern part of the Iberian Peninsula.

Barcelona was recognized as the Southern European City of the Future for 2014/15, based on its economic potential, by &quot;FDi Magazine&quot; in their bi-annual rankings.

=== Trade fair and exhibitions ===
It also has several congress halls, notably Fira de Barcelona â the second largest trade fair and exhibition centre in Europe, that host a quickly growing number of national and international events each year (at present above 50). The total exhibition floor space of Fira de Barcelona venues is , not counting Gran Via centre on the Plaza de Europa. However, the Eurozone crisis and deep cuts in business travel affected the council&#x27;s positioning of the city as a convention centre.

An important business centre, the World Trade Center Barcelona, is located in Barcelona&#x27;s Port Vell harbour.

The city is known for hosting well as world-class conferences and expositions, including the 1888 &quot;ExposiciÃ³n Universal de Barcelona&quot;, the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition (Expo 1929), the 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures and the 2004 World Urban Forum.

=== Tourism ===

Barcelona was the 20th-most-visited city in the world by international visitors and the fifth most visited city in Europe after London, Paris, Istanbul and Rome, with 5.5Â million international visitors in 2011. By 2015, both Prague and Milan had more international visitors. With its popular tree-lined pedestrian street, Les Rambles (Las Ramblas), Barcelona is ranked the most popular city to visit in Spain.

Barcelona is an internationally renowned tourist destination, with numerous recreational areas, one of the best beaches in the world, mild and warm climate, historical monuments, including eight UNESCO World Heritage Sites, 519 hotels including 35 five-star hotels, and developed tourist infrastructure.

Due to its large influx of tourists each year, Barcelona, like many other tourism capitals, has to deal with pickpockets, with wallets and passports being commonly stolen items. Despite its moderate pickpocket rate, Barcelona is considered one of the safest cities in terms of security and personal safety, mainly because of a sophisticated policing strategy that has dropped crime by 32% in just over three years and has led it to be considered the 15th safest city in the world by &quot;Business Insider&quot; in 2016.
While tourism produces economic benefits, according to one report, the city is &quot;overrun [by] hordes of tourists&quot;. In early 2017, over 150,000 protesters warned that tourism is destabilizing the city. Slogans included &quot;Tourists go home&quot;, &quot;Barcelona is not for sale&quot; and &quot;We will not be driven out&quot;. By then, the number of visitors had increased from 1.7Â million in 1990 to 32 million in a city with a population of 1.62Â million, increasing the cost of rental housing for residents and overcrowding the public places. While tourists spent an estimated â¬30Â billion in 2017, they are viewed by some as a threat to Barcelona&#x27;s identity.

A May 2017 article in the British online daily &quot;The Independent&quot; included Barcelona among the &quot;Eight Places That Hate Tourists the Most&quot; and included a comment from Mayor Ada Colau, &quot;We don&#x27;t want the city to become a cheap souvenir shop&quot;, citing Venice as an example. To moderate the problem, the city has stopped issuing licenses for new hotels and holiday apartments; it also fined AirBnb â¬30,000. The mayor has suggested introducing a new tourist tax and setting a limit on the number of visitors. One industry insider, Justin Francis, founder of the Responsible Travel agency, stated that steps must be taken to limit the number of visitors that are causing an &quot;overtourism crisis&quot; in several major European cities. &quot;Ultimately, residents must be prioritised over tourists for housing, infrastructure and access to services because they have a long-term stake in the city&#x27;s success&quot;, he said. &quot;Managing tourism more responsibly can help&quot;, Francis later told a journalist, &quot;but some destinations may just have too many tourists, and Barcelona may be a case of that&quot;.

=== Manufacturing sector ===
Industry generates 21% of the total gross domestic product (GDP) of the region, with the energy, chemical and metallurgy industries accounting for 47% of industrial production. The Barcelona metropolitan area had 67% of the total number of industrial establishments in Catalonia as of 1997.

Barcelona has long been an important European automobile manufacturing centre. Formerly there were automobile factories of AFA, Abadal, Actividades Industriales, Alvarez, America, ArtÃ©s de Arcos, BalandrÃ¡s, Baradat-Esteve, BiscÃºter, J. Castro, ClÃºa, David, DelfÃ­n, DÃ­az y GrillÃ³, Ebro trucks, , Elizalde, AutomÃ³viles EspaÃ±a, Eucort, Fenix, FÃ¡brica Hispano, Auto Academia Garriga, FÃ¡brica EspaÃ±ola de AutomÃ³viles Hebe, Hispano-Suiza, HuracÃ¡n Motors, Talleres Hereter, Junior SL, Kapi, La Cuadra, M.A., AutomÃ³viles Matas, Motores y Motos, Nacional Custals, National Pescara, Nacional RG, Nacional Rubi, Nacional Sitjes, AutomÃ³viles Nike, Orix, Otro Ford, Patria, Pegaso, PTV, Ricart, Ricart-EspaÃ±a, Industrias Salvador, Siata EspaÃ±ola, Stevenson, Romagosa y CompaÃ±Ã­a, Garaje Storm, Talleres Hereter, Trimak, AutomÃ³viles Victoria, Manufacturas MecÃ¡nicas Aleu.

Today, the headquarters and a large factory of SEAT (the largest Spanish automobile manufacturer) are in one of its suburbs. There is also a Nissan factory in the logistics and industrial area of the city. The factory of Derbi, a large manufacturer of motorcycles, scooters and mopeds, also lies near the city.

As in other modern cities, the manufacturing sector has long since been overtaken by the services sector, though it remains very important. The region&#x27;s leading industries are textiles, chemical, pharmaceutical, motor, electronic, printing, logistics, publishing, in telecommunications industry and culture the notable Mobile World Congress, and information technology services.

=== Fashion ===
The traditional importance of textiles is reflected in Barcelona&#x27;s drive to become a major fashion centre. There have been many attempts to launch Barcelona as a fashion capital, notably &quot;Gaudi Home&quot;.

Beginning in the summer of 2000, the city hosted the Bread &amp; Butter urban fashion fair until 2009, when its organizers announced that it would be returning to Berlin. This was a hard blow for the city as the fair brought â¬100Â m to the city in just three days.

From 2009, &quot;The Brandery&quot;, an urban fashion show, was held in Barcelona twice a year until 2012. According to the Global Language Monitor&#x27;s annual ranking of the world&#x27;s top fifty fashion capitals Barcelona was named as the seventh most important fashion capital of the world right after Milan and before Berlin in 2015.

== Government and administrative divisions ==

As the capital of the autonomous community of Catalonia, Barcelona is the seat of the Catalan government, known as the &quot;Generalitat de Catalunya&quot;; of particular note are the executive branch, the parliament, and the High Court of Justice of Catalonia. The city is also the capital of the Province of Barcelona and the BarcelonÃ¨s comarca (district).

Barcelona is governed by a city council formed by 41 city councillors, elected for a four-year term by universal suffrage. As one of the two biggest cities in Spain, Barcelona is subject to a special law articulated through the &quot;Carta Municipal&quot; (Municipal Law). A first version of this law was passed in 1960 and amended later, but the current version was approved in March 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;ley 1/2006&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to this law, Barcelona&#x27;s city council is organized in two levels: a political one, with elected city councillors, and one executive, which administers the programs and executes the decisions taken on the political level. This law also gives the local government a special relationship with the central government and it also gives the mayor wider prerogatives by the means of municipal executive commissions. It expands the powers of the city council in areas like telecommunications, city traffic, road safety and public safety. It also gives a special economic regime to the city&#x27;s treasury and it gives the council a veto in matters that will be decided by the central government, but that will need a favourable report from the council.
The &quot;ComissiÃ³ de Govern&quot; (Government Commission) is the executive branch, formed by 24 councillors, led by the Mayor, with 5 lieutenant-mayors and 17 city councillors, each in charge of an area of government, and 5 non-elected councillors. The plenary, formed by the 41 city councillors, has advisory, planning, regulatory, and fiscal executive functions. The six &quot;Commissions del Consell Municipal&quot; (City council commissions) have executive and controlling functions in the field of their jurisdiction. They are composed by a number of councillors proportional to the number of councillors each political party has in the plenary. The city council has jurisdiction in the fields of city planning, transportation, municipal taxes, public highways security through the &quot;GuÃ rdia Urbana&quot; (the municipal police), city maintenance, gardens, parks and environment, facilities (like schools, nurseries, sports centres, libraries, and so on), culture, sports, youth and social welfare. Some of these competencies are not exclusive, but shared with the Generalitat de Catalunya or the central Spanish government. In some fields with shared responsibility (such as public health, education or social services), there is a shared Agency or Consortium between the city and the Generalitat to plan and manage services.
The executive branch is led by a Chief Municipal Executive Officer which answers to the Mayor. It is made up of departments which are legally part of the city council and by separate legal entities of two types: autonomous public departments and public enterprises.

The seat of the city council is on the PlaÃ§a de Sant Jaume, opposite the seat of Generalitat de Catalunya. Since the coming of the Spanish democracy, Barcelona had been governed by the PSC, first with an absolute majority and later in coalition with ERC and ICV. After the May 2007 election, the ERC did not renew the coalition agreement and the PSC governed in a minority coalition with ICV as the junior partner.

After 32 years, on 22 May 2011, CiU gained a plurality of seats at the municipal election, gaining 15 seats to the PSC&#x27;s 11. The PP hold 8 seats, ICV 5 and ERC 2.

=== Districts ===


Since 1987, the city has been divided into 10Â administrative districts (&quot;districtes&quot; in Catalan, &quot;distritos&quot; in Spanish):
*Ciutat Vella
*Eixample
*Sants-MontjuÃ¯c
*Les Corts
*SarriÃ -Sant Gervasi
*GrÃ cia
*Horta-GuinardÃ³
*Nou Barris
*Sant Andreu
*Sant MartÃ­

The districts are based mostly on historical divisions, and several are former towns annexed by the city of Barcelona in the 18th and 19th centuries that still maintain their own distinct character. Each district has its own council led by a city councillor. The composition of each district council depends on the number of votes each political party had in that district, so a district can be led by a councillor from a different party than the executive council.

== Education ==


Barcelona has a well-developed higher education system of public universities. Most prominent among these are the University of Barcelona (established in 1450) and the more modern Pompeu Fabra University. Barcelona is also home to the Polytechnic University of Catalonia, and in the private sector the EADA Business School (founded in 1957), which became the first Barcelona institution to run manager training programmes for the business community. IESE Business School, as well as the largest private educational institution, the Ramon Llull University, which encompasses schools and institutes such as the ESADE Business School. The Autonomous University of Barcelona, another public university, is located in Bellaterra, a town in the Metropolitan Area. Toulouse Business School and the Open University of Catalonia (a private Internet-centred open university) are also based in Barcelona.

The city has a network of public schools, from nurseries to high schools, under the responsibility of a consortium led by city council (though the curriculum is the responsibility of the Generalitat de Catalunya). There are also many private schools, some of them Roman Catholic. Most such schools receive a public subsidy on a per-student basis, are subject to inspection by the public authorities, and are required to follow the same curricular guidelines as public schools, though they charge tuition. Known as &quot;escoles concertades&quot;, they are distinct from schools whose funding is entirely private (&quot;escoles privades&quot;).

The language of instruction at public schools and &quot;escoles concertades&quot; is Catalan, as stipulated by the 2009 Catalan Education Act. Spanish may be used as a language of instruction by teachers of Spanish literature or language, and foreign languages by teachers of those languages. An experimental partial immersion programme adopted by some schools allows for the teaching of a foreign language (English, generally) across the curriculum, though this is limited to a maximum of 30% of the school day. No public school or &quot;escola concertada&quot; in Barcelona may offer 50% or full immersion programmes in a foreign language, nor does any public school or &quot;escola concertada&quot; offer International Baccalaureate programmes.

== Culture ==

Barcelona&#x27;s cultural roots go back 2000 years. Since the arrival of democracy, the Catalan language (very much repressed during the dictatorship of Franco) has been promoted, both by recovering works from the past and by stimulating the creation of new works. Barcelona is designated as a world-class city by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network. It has also been part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network as a City of Literature since 2015.

=== Entertainment and performing arts ===

Barcelona has many venues for live music and theatre, including the world-renowned Gran Teatre del Liceu opera house, the Teatre Nacional de Catalunya, the Teatre Lliure and the Palau de la MÃºsica Catalana concert hall. Barcelona also is home to the Barcelona Symphony and Catalonia National Orchestra (Orquestra SimfÃ²nica de Barcelona i Nacional de Catalunya, usually known as OBC), the largest symphonic orchestra in Catalonia. In 1999, the OBC inaugurated its new venue in the brand-new Auditorium (L&#x27;Auditori). It performs around 75 concerts per season and its current director is Eiji Oue. It is home to the Barcelona Guitar Orchestra, directed by Sergi Vicente. The major thoroughfare of La Rambla is home to mime artists and street performers. Yearly, two major pop music festivals take place in the city, the SÃ³nar Festival and the Primavera Sound Festival. The city also has a thriving alternative music scene, with groups such as The Pinker Tones receiving international attention. Barcelona is an international hub of highly active and diverse nightlife with bars, dance bars and nightclubs staying open well past midnight.

=== Media ===
&quot;El PeriÃ³dico de Catalunya&quot;, &quot;La Vanguardia&quot; and &quot;Ara&quot; are Barcelona&#x27;s three major daily newspapers (the first two with Catalan and Spanish editions, &quot;Ara&quot; only in Catalan) while &quot;Sport&quot; and &quot;El Mundo Deportivo&quot; (both in Spanish) are the city&#x27;s two major sports daily newspapers, published by the same companies. The city is also served by a number of smaller publications such as &quot;Ara&quot; and &quot;El Punt Avui&quot; (in Catalan), by nationwide newspapers with special Barcelona editions such as &quot;El PaÃ­s&quot; (in Spanish, with an online version in Catalan) and &quot;El Mundo&quot; (in Spanish), and by several free newspapers like &quot;20 minutos&quot; and &quot;QuÃ¨&quot; (all bilingual).

Barcelona&#x27;s oldest and main online newspaper &quot;VilaWeb&quot; is also the oldest one in Europe (with Catalan and English editions).

Several major FM stations include Catalunya RÃ dio, RAC 1, RAC 105 and Cadena SER. Barcelona also has a local TV station, BetevÃ©, owned by city council. The headquarters of TelevisiÃ³ de Catalunya, Catalonia&#x27;s public network, are located in Sant Joan DespÃ­, in Barcelona&#x27;s metropolitan area.

Barcelona has a long sporting tradition and hosted the highly successful 1992 Summer Olympics as well as several matches during the 1982 FIFA World Cup (at the two stadiums). It has hosted about 30 sports events of international significance. FC Barcelona is a sports club best known worldwide for its football team, one of the largest and the wealthiest in the world. It has 74 national trophies (while finishing 46 times as runners-up) and 17 continental prizes (with being runners-up 11 times), including five UEFA Champions League trophies out of eight finals and three FIFA Club World Cup wins out of four finals.

The club&#x27;s museum is the second most visited in Catalonia. The matches against cross-town rivals RCD Espanyol are of particular interest, but there are other Barcelonan football clubs in lower categories, like CE Europa and UE Sant Andreu. FC Barcelona&#x27;s basketball team has a noted rivalry in the Liga ACB with nearby Joventut Badalona.
Barcelona has three UEFA elite stadiums: FC Barcelona&#x27;s Camp Nou, the largest stadium in Europe with a capacity of 99,354; the publicly owned Estadi OlÃ­mpic LluÃ­s Companys, with a capacity of 55,926; used for the 1992 Olympics; and Estadi CornellÃ -El Prat, with a capacity of 40,500. Furthermore, the city has several smaller stadiums such as Mini Estadi (also owned by FC Barcelona) with a capacity of 15,000, Camp Municipal NarcÃ­s Sala with a capacity of 6,563 and Nou Sardenya with a capacity of 7,000.

Barcelona was the host city for the 2013 World Aquatics Championships, which were held at the Palau San Jordi.
Several road running competitions are organized year-round in Barcelona: the Barcelona Marathon every March with over 10,000 participants in 2010, the Cursa de Bombers in April, the Cursa de El Corte InglÃ©s in May (with about 60,000 participants each year), the Cursa de la MercÃ¨, the Cursa Jean Bouin, the Milla Sagrada FamÃ­lia and the San Silvestre. There is also the Ultratrail Collserola which passes through the Collserola forest. The Open Seat GodÃ³, a 50-year-old ATP World Tour 500 Series tennis tournament, is held annually in the facilities of the Real Club de Tenis Barcelona. Each year on Christmas Day, a 200-meter swimming race across the Old Port of Barcelona takes place. Near Barcelona, in MontmelÃ³, the 107,000 capacity Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya racetrack hosts the Formula One Spanish Grand Prix, the Catalan motorcycle Grand Prix, the Spanish GT Championship and races in the GP2 Series. Skateboarding and cycling are also very popular in Barcelona; in and around the city there are dozens of kilometers of bicycle paths.

=== Squatter movement ===
Barcelona is also home to numerous social centres and illegal squats that effectively form a shadow society mainly made up of the unemployed, immigrants, dropouts, anarchists, anti-authoritarians and autonomists. Peter Gelderloos estimates that there around 200 squatted buildings and 40 social centres across the city with thousands of inhabitants, making it one of the largest squatter movements in the world. He notes that they pirate electricity, internet and water allowing them to live on less than one euro a day. He argues that these squats embrace an anarcho-communist and anti-work philosophy, often freely fixing up new houses, cleaning, patching roofs, installing windows, toilets, showers, lights and kitchens. In the wake of austerity, the squats have provided a number of social services to the surrounding residents, including bicycle repair workshops, carpentry workshops, self-defense classes, free libraries, community gardens, free meals, computer labs, language classes, theatre groups, free medical care and legal support services. The squats help elderly residents avoid eviction and organize various protests throughout Barcelona. Notable squats include Can Vies and Can Masdeu.

== Transport ==
=== Airports ===

Barcelona is served by Barcelona-El Prat Airport, about south-west of the centre of Barcelona. It is the second-largest airport in Spain, and the largest on the Mediterranean coast, which handled more than 50.17Â million passengers in 2018, showing an annual upward trend. It is a main hub for Vueling Airlines and Ryanair, and also a focus for Iberia and Air Europa. The airport mainly serves domestic and European destinations, although some airlines offer destinations in Latin America, Asia and the United States. The airport is connected to the city by highway, metro (Airport T1 and Airport T2 stations), commuter train (Barcelona Airport railway station) and scheduled bus service. A new terminal (T1) has been built, and entered service on 17 June 2009.

Some low-cost airlines, also use Girona-Costa Brava Airport, about to the north, Reus Airport, to the south, or Lleida-Alguaire Airport, about to the west, of the city. Sabadell Airport is a smaller airport in the nearby town of Sabadell, devoted to pilot training, aerotaxi and private flights.

=== Seaport ===
The Port of Barcelona has a 2000-year-old history and a great contemporary commercial importance. It is Europe&#x27;s ninth largest container port, with a trade volume of 1.72Â million TEU&#x27;s in 2013. The port is managed by the Port Authority of Barcelona. Its are divided into three zones: Port Vell (the old port), the commercial port and the logistics port (Barcelona Free Port). The port is undergoing an enlargement that will double its size thanks to diverting the mouth of the Llobregat river to the south.
The Barcelona harbour is the leading European cruiser port and a very important Mediterranean turnaround base. In 2013, 3.6Â million pleasure cruise passengers used the Port of Barcelona.

The Port Vell area also houses the Maremagnum (a commercial mall), a multiplex cinema, the IMAX Port Vell and one of Europe&#x27;s largest aquariums â Aquarium Barcelona, containing 8,000 fish and 11 sharks contained in 22 basins filled with 4 million litres of sea water. The Maremagnum, being situated within the confines of the port, is the only commercial mall in the city that can open on Sundays and public holidays.

=== National and international rail ===
Barcelona is a major hub for the Spanish rail network. The city&#x27;s main Inter-city rail station is Barcelona Sants railway station, whilst EstaciÃ³ de FranÃ§a terminus serves a secondary role handling suburban, regional and medium distance services. Freight services operate to local industries and to the Port of Barcelona.

RENFE&#x27;s AVE high-speed rail system, which is designed for speeds of , was extended from Madrid to Barcelona in 2008 in the form of the MadridâBarcelona high-speed rail line. A shared RENFE-SNCF high-speed rail connecting Barcelona and France (Paris, Marseille and Toulouse, through PerpignanâBarcelona high-speed rail line) was launched in 2013. Both these lines serve Barcelona Sants terminal station.

=== Metro and regional rail ===

Barcelona is served by an extensive local public transport network that includes a metro system, a bus network, a regional railway system, trams, funiculars, rack railways, a Gondola lift and aerial cable cars. These networks and lines are run by a number of different operators but they are integrated into a coordinated fare system, administered by the Autoritat del Transport MetropolitÃ  (ATM). The system is divided into fare zones (1 to 6) and various Integrated Travel Cards are available.

The Barcelona Metro network comprises twelve lines, identified by an &quot;L&quot; followed by the line number as well as by individual colours. The Metro largely runs underground; eight Metro lines are operated on dedicated track by the Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona (TMB), whilst four lines are operated by the (FGC) and some of them share tracks with RENFE commuter lines.

In addition to the city Metro, several regional rail lines operated by RENFE&#x27;s Rodalies de Catalunya run across the city, providing connections to outlying towns in the surrounding region.

=== Tram ===

The city&#x27;s two modern tram systems, Trambaix and TrambesÃ²s, are operated by TRAMMET. A heritage tram line, the Tramvia Blau, also operates between the metro Line 7 and the Funicular del Tibidabo.

=== Funicular and cable car ===
Barcelona&#x27;s metro and rail system is supplemented by several aerial cable cars, funiculars and rack railways that provide connections to mountain-top stations. FGC operates the Funicular de Tibidabo up the hill of Tibidabo and the Funicular de Vallvidrera (FGC), while TMB runs the Funicular de MontjuÃ¯c up MontjuÃ¯c. The city has two aerial cable cars: the MontjuÃ¯c Cable Car, which serves MontjuÃ¯c castle, and the Port Vell Aerial Tramway that runs via Torre Jaume I and Torre Sant SebastiÃ  over the port.

=== Bus ===
Buses in Barcelona are a major form of public transport, with extensive local, interurban and night bus networks. Most local services are operated by the TMB, although some other services are operated by a number of private companies, albeit still within the ATM fare structure. There are 21 night lines, 19 of them go through PlaÃ§a de Catalunya, where you can change to other lines. The frequency is 15/20 minutes between 22:20 and 06:00. A separate private bus line, known as AerobÃºs, links the airport with the city centre, with its own fare structure.

The EstaciÃ³ del Nord (Northern Station), a former railway station which was renovated for the 1992 Olympic Games, now serves as the terminus for long-distance and regional bus services.

=== Taxi ===

Barcelona has a metered taxi fleet governed by the Institut MetropolitÃ  del Taxi (Metropolitan Taxi Institute), composed of more than 10,000 cars. Most of the licences are in the hands of self-employed drivers. With their black and yellow livery, Barcelona&#x27;s taxis are easily spotted, and can be caught from one of many taxi ranks, hailed on street, called by telephone or via app.

On 22 March 2007, Barcelona&#x27;s City Council started the Bicing service, a bicycle service understood as a public transport. Once the user has their user card, they can take a bicycle from any of the more than 400 stations spread around the city and use it anywhere the urban area of the city, and then leave it at another station. The service has been a success, with 50,000 subscribed users in three months.

=== Roads and highways ===
Barcelona lies on three international routes, including European route E15 that follows the Mediterranean coast, European route E90 to Madrid and Lisbon, and European route E09 to Paris. It is also served by a comprehensive network of motorways and highways throughout the metropolitan area, including A-2, A-7/AP-7, C-16, C-17, C-31, C-32, C-33, C-60.

The city is circled by three half ring roads or bypasses, Ronda de Dalt (B-20) (on the mountain side), Ronda del Litoral (B-10) (along the coast) and Ronda del Mig (separated into two parts: Travessera de Dalt in the north and the Gran Via de Carles III), two partially covered fast highways with several exits that bypass the city.

The city&#x27;s main arteries include Diagonal Avenue, which crosses it diagonally, Meridiana Avenue which leads to GlÃ²ries and connects with Diagonal Avenue and Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, which crosses the city from east to west, passing through its centre. The famous boulevard of La Rambla, whilst no longer an important vehicular route, remains an important pedestrian route.

== Main sights ==
The &quot;Barri GÃ²tic&quot; (Catalan for &quot;Gothic Quarter&quot;) is the centre of the old city of Barcelona. Many of the buildings date from medieval times, some from as far back as the Roman settlement of Barcelona. Catalan &quot;modernista&quot; architecture (related to the movement known as Art Nouveau in the rest of Europe) developed between 1885 and 1950 and left an important legacy in Barcelona. Several of these buildings are World Heritage Sites. Especially remarkable is the work of architect Antoni GaudÃ­, which can be seen throughout the city. His best-known work is the immense but still unfinished church of the Sagrada FamÃ­lia, which has been under construction since 1882 and is still financed by private donations. , completion is planned for 2026.

Barcelona was also home to Mies van der Rohe&#x27;s Barcelona Pavilion. Designed in 1929 for the International Exposition for Germany, it was an iconic building that came to symbolize modern architecture as the embodiment of van der Rohe&#x27;s aphorisms &quot;less is more&quot; and &quot;God is in the details&quot;. The Barcelona pavilion was intended as a temporary structure and was torn down in 1930 less than a year after it was constructed. A modern re-creation by Spanish architects now stands in Barcelona, however, constructed in 1986.

Barcelona won the 1999 RIBA Royal Gold Medal for its architecture, the first (and , only) time that the winner has been a city rather than an individual architect. Barcelona is the home of many points of interest declared World Heritage Sites by UNESCO:

=== Museums ===


Barcelona has a great number of museums, which cover different areas and eras. The National Museum of Art of Catalonia possesses a well-known collection of Romanesque art, while the Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art focuses on post-1945 Catalan and Spanish art.

The Museum of Natural Sciences of Barcelona was founded in 1882 under the name of &quot;Museo Martorell de ArqueologÃ­a y Ciencias Naturales&quot; (Spanish for &quot;Martorell Museum of Archaeology and Natural Sciences&quot;). In 2011 the Museum of Natural Sciences ended up with a merge of five institutions: the Museum of Natural Sciences of Barcelona (the main site, at the Forum Building), the Martorell Museum (the historical seat of the Museum, opened to the public from 1924 to 2010 as a geology museum), the &quot;Laboratori de Natura&quot;, at the Castle of the Three Dragons (from 1920 to 2010: the Zoology Museum), the Historical Botanical Garden of Barcelona, founded 1930, and the Botanical garden of Barcelona, founded 1999. Those two gardens are a part of the Botanical Institute of Barcelona too.

The FC Barcelona Museum is the third most popular tourist attraction in Catalonia, with 1,51 million visitors in 2013.

<text>Bandy is a winter sport and ball sport played by two teams wearing ice skates on a large ice surface (either indoors or outdoors) while using sticks to direct a ball into the opposing team&#x27;s goal.

The playing surface, called a bandy field or bandy rink, is a sheet of ice which measures by , about the size of a football pitch. The field is considerably larger than the ice rinks commonly used for ice hockey.

The sport has a common background with association football, ice hockey, shinty, and field hockey. Bandy&#x27;s origins are debatable, but its first rules were organized and published in England in 1882.

Internationally, bandy&#x27;s strongest nations in both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s competitions have long been Sweden and Russia; both countries have established professional men&#x27;s bandy leagues. In Russia, it is estimated that more than one million people play bandy. The sport also has organized league play and fans in other countries, including Finland, Norway, and Kazakhstan. The premier international bandy competition for men is the Bandy World Championship and for women it is the Women&#x27;s Bandy World Championship.

Organized bandy started in the late 19th century; however, until 1955, there was no established international governing body for the sport. The international governing body for bandy today is the Federation of International Bandy (FIB) which formed in February 1955. In 2001, bandy was recognized as a sport by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Both traditional eleven-a-side bandy and rink bandy (which is played on a smaller rink) are recognized by the IOC. Based on the number of participating athletes, the FIB has claimed bandy is the world&#x27;s second-most participated winter sport after ice hockey, but it is not recorded how many of these participants are male and how many are female.

==History==

===Background===
The earliest origin of the sport is debated. Though many Russians see their old countrymen as the creators of the sport â reflected by the unofficial title for bandy, &quot;Russian hockey&quot; (ÑÑÑÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ ÑÐ¾ÐºÐºÐµÐ¹) â Russia, Sweden, medieval Iceland, the Netherlands, England, and Wales each had pastimes, such as bando, which can be seen as forerunners of bandy. The mid-eighteenth-century &quot;Devonshire Dialogue&quot; collection lists Bandy as &quot;a game, like that of Golf, in which the adverse parties endeavour to beat a ball (generally a knob or gnarl from the trunk of a tree,) opposite ways... the stick with which the game is played is crook&#x27;d at the end&quot;.

The sport&#x27;s first published set of organized rules was codified in 1882 by Charles Goodman Tebbutt of the Bury Fen Bandy Club. When the international federation was founded in 1955, it came about after a compromise between Russian and English rules, in which more of the English rules prevailed.

Since association football was already popular in England, the codified bandy rules took after much of the football rules. Like association football, games are normally two 45 minute halves and there are 11 players per side. Players sticks are curved like large field hockey sticks and the bandy ball is roughly the size of a tennis ball with a cork core and hard plastic coating. Bandy balls were originally usually red but are now either orange or more commonly cerise.

===Early days===
Bandy as an ice skating sport first developed in Britain. It developed as a winter sport in the Fens of East Anglia. Large expanses of ice would form on the flooded meadows or shallow washes in cold winters where fen skating, which has been a tradition dating back to at least medieval times, took place. Bandy&#x27;s early recorded modernization period can be traced back to 1813.
Members of the Bury Fen Bandy Club published rules of the game in 1882, and introduced it into other European countries. A variety of stick and ball games involving ice skating were introduced to North America by the 1800s but failed to organize and develop popular rules codes. However, these stick and ball games became one of the eventual antecedents of the modern sport of ice hockey, whose first rules were codified in Canada in 1875, almost a decade before the rules of modern bandy were established in Britain.

The first international bandy match took place in 1891 between Bury Fen and the Haarlemsche Hockey &amp; Bandy Club from the Netherlands (a club which after a couple of club fusions now is named HC Bloemendaal). The same year, the National Bandy Association was established as a governing body for the sport in England. National governing federations for bandy were also founded in the 1890s in the Netherlands and Russia and in the following decade in Finland, Sweden, and Norway.

The match later dubbed &quot;the original bandy match&quot;, was actually held in 1875 at The Crystal Palace in London. However, at the time, the game was called &quot;hockey on the ice&quot;, probably as it was considered an ice variant of field hockey.

An early maker of bandy sticks was the firm of Gray&#x27;s, Cambridge. One such stick, now in the collections of the Museum of Cambridge, has a length of rope twisted round the handle to rescue any player who might fall through the ice, as the game was played on frozen lakes back then. An 1899 photo of two players demonstrating the game shows the sticks being held single-handed.

Historically, bandy was a popular sport in some central and western European countries until the First World War, and from 1901 to 1926 it was played in the Scandinavian Nordic Games, the first international multi-sport event focused on winter sports.

===Etymology===

The sport&#x27;s English name comes from the verb &quot;to bandy&quot;, from the Middle French (&quot;to strike back and forth&quot;), and originally referred to a seventeenth-century Irish game similar to field hockey. The curved stick was also called a &quot;bandy&quot;. The etymological connection to the similarly named Welsh hockey game of bando is not clear.

An old name for bandy is &quot;hockey on the ice&quot;; in the first rule books from England at the turn of the century 1900, the sport is literally called &quot;bandy or hockey on the ice&quot;. Since the early 20th century, the term bandy is usually preferred to prevent confusion with ice hockey.

The sport is known as bandy in many languages, with a few exceptions. In Russia, bandy is called &quot;Russian hockey&quot; () or more frequently, and officially, &quot;hockey with a ball&quot; () while ice hockey is called &quot;hockey with a puck&quot; () or more frequently just &quot;hockey&quot;. If the context makes it clear that bandy is the subject, it as well can be called just &quot;hockey&quot;. In Belarusian, Ukrainian and Bulgarian it is also called &quot;hockey with a ball&quot; (, and respectively). In Slovak &quot;bandy hockey&quot; () is the name. In Armenian, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Mongol and Uzbek, bandy is known as &quot;ball hockey&quot; (, , , and respectively). In Finnish the two sports are distinguished as &quot;ice ball&quot; () and &quot;ice puck&quot; (), as well as in Hungarian (), although in Hungarian it is more often called &quot;bandy&quot; nowadays. In Estonian and Lithuanian bandy is also called &quot;ice ball&quot; (; ). In Mandarin Chinese it is &quot;bandy ball&quot; (). In Scottish Gaelic the name is &quot;ice shinty&quot; (). In old times shinty or shinney were also sometimes used in English for bandy.

Because of its similarities with association football, bandy is also nicknamed &quot;winter football&quot; ().

===Historical relationship with other sports===
====Bandy and association football====
With association football and &quot;hockey on ice&quot; or bandy both being popular sports in parts of Europe around 1900, bandy was highly influenced by football and taking after its main rules: having a field approximately the same size, having the same number of players on each team and having the same game time (2Ã45 minutes). It is natural that bandy got the nickname &#x27;winter football&#x27;.

It was common for sports clubs to have both a bandy and a football section, with athletes playing both sports but at different times of the year. Some examples are &quot;Nottingham Forest Football and Bandy Club&quot; in England (today known just as Nottingham Forest F.C.) and Norwegian StrÃ¸msgodset IF and MjÃ¸ndalen IF, with both having an active bandy section.

In Sweden, most football clubs that were active during the first half of the 20th century also played bandy. Swedish player Orvar Bergmark earned silver medals in the world championships of both sports in the 1950s. Later, as the season for each sport increased in time, it was not as easy for the players to engage in both sports, so some clubs came to concentrate on one or the other. Many old clubs still have both sports on their program. Sten-Ove Ramberg is the last Swedish male player in both national teams (1978 in bandy, 1979â1984 in football).

====Bandy and ice hockey====
No clear distinction between bandy and ice hockey was made before the 1920s. As bandy in a way can be seen as a precursor to ice hockey, bandy has influenced the development and history of ice hockey, mainly in European and former Soviet countries. While modern ice hockey was created in Canada, a variety of games which bore a closer resemblance to bandy were initially played there after British soldiers introduced the game of bandy in the late 19th century. At the same time as modern ice hockey rules were formalized in British North America (present-day Canada), bandy rules were decided upon in Europe. A cross between English and Russian bandy rules eventually developed with the football-inspired English rules (&quot;cf&quot; the passage above about bandy and Association football) becoming dominant, together with the Russian low-border along most of the two sidelines, an addition to the sport which has maintained its presence since the 1950s.

Before Canadians introduced ice hockey into Europe in the early 20th century, &quot;hockey&quot; was another name for bandy, and still is in parts of Russia and Kazakhstan.

Both bandy and ice hockey were played in Europe during the 20th century, especially in Sweden, Finland, and Norway. Ice hockey became more popular than bandy in most of Europe, mostly because it had become an Olympic sport, while bandy had not. Athletes in Europe who had played bandy switched to ice hockey in the 1920s to compete in the Olympics. The smaller ice fields needed for ice hockey also made its rinks easier to maintain, especially in countries with short winters. On the other hand, ice hockey was not played in the Soviet Union until the 1950s, when the USSR wanted to compete internationally. The typical European style of ice hockey, with flowing, less physical play, represents a heritage of bandy.

===Modern development===
====First national bandy league====
The first national bandy league in modern history was started in Sweden in 1902.

====Bandy in the Nordic Games====
Bandy was played at the Nordic Games in both Stockholm and Kristiania (present day Oslo) in 1901, 1903, 1905, 1909, 1913, 1917, 1922 and 1926, and between Swedish, Finnish and Russian teams at similar games in Helsinki in 1907. Bandy appeared as a sport in all eight editions of the Nordic Games from 1901 to 1926.

====European Bandy Championships====

Some sources describe a 1913 European Bandy Championships as having been held in February 1913, in St. Moritz, Switzerland, at the same time as the bandy tournament at the 1913 Nordic Games. However, this European Championship tournament likely never happened, or is a conflation of titles, since no contemporary sources have been found. Still, in 2014, a Four Nation Bandy tournament was held in Davos, Switzerland, as a centenary celebration of the alleged 1913 European Bandy Championships.

====Highest altitude====
The highest altitude where bandy has been played is in Khorugh, the capital of the Tajik autonomous province of Gorno-Badakhshan. Khorugh is situated above sea level in the Pamir Mountains.

====World Championships and Russian performance====

Since the 1950s, when the Soviet Union ended its isolation and started to take part in international sports events, there has been a reason to play world championships. The International Bandy Federation was founded in 1955 and the first world championships were played in 1957 with the Soviet Union and then Russia (as its successor country in 1993) almost consistently in a top position in the sport of bandy alongside Sweden. Finland has won once, in 2004.

In a similar fashion, Russia, along with Sweden, has emerged as one of the two dominant women&#x27;s bandy nations internationally in the Women&#x27;s Bandy World Championship.

====Women&#x27;s bandy====
Women&#x27;s bandy uses the exact same rules as men, but the women&#x27;s game is played separately. Women have been playing bandy since the sport was originally developed. Although there were several attempts in the early part of the 19th century to organize bandy leagues for women&#x27;s teams, regular leagues only started in the 1970s in Sweden and Finland and then later in the 1980s in Norway and the Soviet Union.

====Bandy moving indoors====
Starting in the 1980s and increasingly since the turn of the millennium, more and more indoor arenas for bandy have been built (often as joint arenas to be used also for football or speed skating). The use of indoor arenas makes the effects of the weather on a game virtually insignificant, something which earlier always have been a factor to consider for the teams and the audiences. However, unlike some other sports, bandy is still the same game with the same rules indoors or outdoors and no changes are made to the rules depending on whether there&#x27;s a roof overhead or not. Many games, even in the highest leagues, are still played outdoors. In Sweden there are more indoor arenas than in all other countries combined.

==Overview==

Bandy is played on ice, using a single round bandy ball. Two teams of 11 players each compete to get the ball into the other team&#x27;s goal using bandy sticks, thereby scoring a goal. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner. If both teams have scored an equal number of goals, then, with some exceptions, the game is a draw. The game is designed to be played on a rectangular sheet of ice, called a bandy field, which is the same size as a football (soccer) field.

In a typical game, players attempt to propel the ball toward their opponents&#x27; goal through individual control of the ball, such as by dribbling, passing the ball to a teammate, and taking shots at the goal, which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper. Opposing players may try to regain control of the ball by intercepting a pass or tackling the opponent who controls the ball. However, physical contact between opponents is limited. Bandy is generally a free-flowing game, with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of play, or when play is stopped by the referee. After a stoppage, play can recommence with a free stroke, a penalty shot or a corner stroke. If the ball has left the field along the sidelines, the referee must decide which team touched the ball last, and award a restart stroke to the opposing team, just like football&#x27;s throw-in.

In terms of rules, bandy has several rules that are similar to football. Each team has 11 players, one of whom is a goalkeeper. Goalkeepers use gloves made specifically for their position and wear them on both hands but do not use any type of stick. The offside rule, which in general is similar to the one used in football, is also employed. A goal cannot be scored from a goal throw, but unlike football, a goal can be scored from a stroke-in or a corner stroke. All free strokes are &quot;direct&quot; and allow a goal to be scored without another player touching the ball. A primary rule is that players (other than the goalkeepers) may not intentionally touch the ball with their heads, hands or arms during play. Although players usually use their sticks to move the ball around, they may use any part of their bodies other than their heads, hands or arms and may use their skates in a limited manner.

The rules do not specify any player positions other than goalkeeper, but a number of player specialisations have evolved. Broadly, these include three main categories:
* forwards, whose main task is to score goals
* defenders, who specialise in preventing their opponents from scoring
* midfielders, who take the ball from the opposition and pass it to the forwards.

Players in these positions are referred to as outfield players, to discern them from the single goalkeeper. These positions are further differentiated by which side of the field the player spends most time in. For example, there are central defenders, and left and right midfielders. The ten outfield players may be arranged in these positions in any combination (for example, there may be three defenders, five midfielders, and two forwards), and the number of players in each position determines the style of the team&#x27;s play; more forwards and fewer defenders would create a more aggressive and offensive-minded game, while the reverse would create a slower, more defensive style of play. While players may spend most of the game in a specific position, there are few restrictions on player movement, and players can switch positions at any time. The layout of the players on the pitch is called the team&#x27;s formation, and defining the team&#x27;s formation and tactics is usually the prerogative of the team&#x27;s manager(s). Formation in bandy is often comparable to the formation in association football.

Shouldering is allowed in checking situations and body contact therefore does occur, but body checking and fighting are illegal.

Bandy is a swift game. Elite players have a mean skating velocity of over 16Â km/h and the skating velocity can in some cases reach 37Â km/h.

==Rules==

There are eighteen rules in official play, designed to apply to all levels of bandy, although certain modifications for groups such as juniors, veterans or women are permitted. The rules are often framed in broad terms, which allow flexibility in their application depending on the nature of the game. A game is officiated by a referee, the authority and enforcer of the rules, whose decisions are final. The referee may have one or two assistant referees. A secretary outside of the field often takes care of the match protocol.

The Bandy Playing Rules can be found on the official website of the Federation of International Bandy, and are overseen by the Rules and Referee Committee.

===Players===
Each team consists of a maximum of 11 players (excluding substitutes), one of whom must be the goalkeeper. A team of fewer than eight players may not start a game. Goalkeepers are the only players allowed to play the ball with their hands or arms, and they are only allowed to do so within the penalty area in front of their own goal.

Though there are a variety of positions in which the outfield (non-goalkeeper) players are strategically placed by a coach, these positions are not defined or required by the rules of the game.

The positions and formations of the players in bandy are virtually the same as the common association football positions and the same terms are used for the different positions of the players. A team usually consists of defenders, midfielders and forwards. The defenders can play in the form of centre-backs, full-backs and sometimes wing-backs, midfielders playing in the centre, attacking or defensive, and forwards in the form of centre forward, second strikers and sometimes a winger. Sometimes one player is also taking up the role of a libero.

Any number of players may be replaced by substitutes during the course of the game. Substitutions can be performed without notifying the referee and can be performed while the ball is in play. However, the substitute must leave the ice before the teammate enters it. A team can bring at the most four substitutes to the game, five if one of these is an extra goalkeeper.

===Formation===

Formation in bandy describes how the players in a team generally position themselves on the rink and is often comparable to the formation in association football. The team&#x27;s manager(s) define the team&#x27;s formation while tactics are usually their prerogative as well.

Bandy is a fluid and fast-moving game, and (with the exception of the goalkeeper) a player&#x27;s position in a formation defines their role less rigidly than â for instance â for a rugby player, nor are there episodes in play where players must expressly line up in formation (as in gridiron football). The bandy games are more similar to association football in this regard. Nevertheless, a player&#x27;s position in a formation generally defines whether a player has a mostly defensive or attacking role, and whether they tend to play towards one side of the pitch or centrally.

===Duration and tie-breaking measures===
A standard adult bandy match consists of two periods of 45 minutes each, known as halves. Each half runs continuously, meaning the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play; the referee can, however, make allowance for time lost through significant stoppages as described below. There is usually a 15-minute half-time break. The end of the match is known as full-time.

The referee is the official timekeeper for the match and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is commonly referred to as &quot;stoppage time&quot; or &quot;injury-time&quot;, and must be reported to the match secretary and the two captains. The referee alone signals the end of the match.

If it is very cold or if it is snowing, the match can be broken into thirds of 30 minutes each. At the extremely cold 1999 World Championship some matches were played in four periods of 15 minutes each and with extra long breaks in between. In the World Championships the two halves can be 30 minutes each for the nations in the B division.

In league competitions, games may end in a draw, but in some knockout competitions if a game is tied at the end of regulation time it may go into extra time, which usually consists of two further 10-minute periods. If the score is still tied after extra time, the game will be decided on penalties. The teams shoot five penalties each and if this doesn&#x27;t settle the game, the teams shoot one more penalty each until one of them misses and the other scores.

===Ball in and out of play===
Under the rules, the two basic states of play during a game are &quot;ball in play&quot; and &quot;ball out of play&quot;. From the beginning of each playing period with a stroke-off (a set strike from the centre-spot by one team) until the end of the playing period, the ball is in play at all times, except when either the ball leaves the field of play, or play is stopped by the referee. When the ball becomes out of play, play is restarted by one of six restart methods depending on how it went out of play:

* Stroke-off
* Goal-throw
* Corner stroke
* Free-stroke
* Penalty shot
* Face-off

If the time runs out while a team is preparing for a free-stroke or penalty, the strike should still be made but it must go into the goal by one shot to count as a goal. Similarly, a goal made via a corner stroke should be allowed, but it must be executed using only one shot in addition to the strike needed to put the ball in play.

===Free-strokes and penalty shots===
Free-strokes can be awarded to a team if a player of the opposite team breaks any rule, for example, by hitting with the stick against the opponent&#x27;s stick or skates. Free-strokes can also be awarded upon incorrect execution of corner-strikes, free-strikes, goal-throws, and so on, or the use of incorrect equipment, such as a broken stick.

Rather than stopping play, the referee may allow play to continue when its continuation will benefit the team against which an offence has been committed. This is known as &quot;playing an advantage&quot;. The referee may &quot;call back&quot; play and penalise the original offence if the anticipated advantage does not ensue within a short period of time, typically taken to be four to five seconds. Even if an offence is not penalised because the referee plays an advantage, the offender may still be sanctioned (see below) for any associated misconduct at the next stoppage of play.

If a defender violently attacks an opponent within the penalty area, a penalty shot is awarded. Certain other offences, when carried out within the penalty area, for instance a defender holding or hooking an attacker, or blocking a goal situation with a lifted skate, thrown stick or glove and so on result in a penalty shot. Also, the defenders (with the exception of the goal-keeper) are not allowed to kneel or lie on the ice. The final offences that might mandate a penalty shot are those of hitting or blocking an opponent&#x27;s stick or touching the ball with the hands, arms, stick or head. A 10-minute penalty or a red card may be issued to the offending player as well.

===Warnings and penalties===
A yellow card indicates a warning given to an entire team for technical fouls such as errors in the execution of goal-throws or free strokes, or the obstruction of a player without ball. Subsequent technical fouls by the same team result in a five-minute penalty indicated by a white card. A five-minute penalty is indicated through the use of a white card witch is half of the time of the blue card and can be caused by trying to hinder the opponents from executing a free-stroke, illegal substitution or repeated illegal but non-violent attacks on an opponent, a ten-minute penalty is indicated through the use of a blue card and can be caused by protesting or behaving incorrectly, attacking an opponent violently or stopping the ball incorrectly to get an advantage.

The third time a player receives a time penalty, it will be a personal penalty, meaning he or she will miss the remainder of the match. A substitute can enter the field after five or ten minutes, depending on the type of time penalty received. A full game penalty can be received upon using abusive language or directly attacking an opponent and means that the player can neither play nor be substituted for the remainder of the game. A match penalty is indicated through the use of a red card.

===Offside===

The offside rule effectively limits the ability to attack players to remain forward (i.e. closer to the opponent&#x27;s goal-line) of the ball, the second-to-last defending player (which can include the goalkeeper), and the half-way line. This rule is in general similar to that of soccer.

==Equipment==
The basic equipment players are required to wear includes a pair of bandy skates, a helmet, a mouthguard and, in the case of the goalkeeper, a faceguard.

The teams must wear uniforms that make it easy to distinguish the two teams. The goalkeeper wears distinct colours to be singled out from his or her teammates, just as in football. The ice skates, sticks and any tape on the stick must be of another colour than the bandy ball, which is orange or cerise.

In addition to the aforementioned items, various pieces of gear are used to protect the knees, elbows, genitals and throat. The pants and gloves may contain padding.

===Bandy stick===

The stick used in bandy is an essential part of the sport. It should be made of an approved material such as wood or a similar material and should not contain any metal or sharp parts which can hurt the surrounding players.

Sticks are crooked and are available in five angles, where 1 has the smallest bend and 5 has the most. Bend 4 is the most common size in professional bandy.

The bandy stick should not have similar colours to the ball, such as orange or pink; it should be no longer than , and no wider than .

===Bandy field===

A bandy field is by , a total of , or about the same size as a football pitch and considerably larger than an ice hockey rink, which is by . Along the sidelines a high border (vant, sarg, wand, wall) is placed to prevent the ball from leaving the ice. It should not be attached to the ice, to glide upon collisions, and should end away from the corners.

Centered at each shortline is a wide and high goal cage and in front of the cage is a half-circular penalty area with a radius. A penalty spot is located in front of the goal and there are two free-stroke spots at the penalty area line, each surrounded by a circle.

A centre spot with a circle of radius denotes the center of the field. A centre-line is drawn through the centre spot parallel with the shortlines.

At each of the corners, a radius quarter-circle is drawn, and a dotted line is painted parallel to the shortline and away from it without extending into the penalty area. The dotted line can be replaced with a long line starting at the edge of the penalty area and extending towards the sideline, from the shortline.

The goal cage used in bandy is wide and high and is the largest one used by any organized winter team sport.

===Protective equipment===

Bandy players require protective equipment, some of which is designed specifically for the sport such as the bandy chinguard. Equipment is similar to that worn in ice hockey but is typically smaller, lighter, and more flexible, and more closely resembles the equipment worn in the modern sport of ringette.

All players are required to wear helmets. While some bandy players are required to wear facemasks such as young players, some outfield players only wear a helmet with a bandy chin guard. Goaltenders are the exception and must wear a helmet and facemask at all times.

==International==
===International games in the early years===
The first international games were played by club teams in the 1890s.

Starting in the first decade of the 20th century, friendlies were played between national teams of some European countries. While games like this did not take place in central and western Europe after the 1910s, the Nordic countries of Estonia, Finland, Norway, and Sweden continued, doing it more regularly during the 1920s and 1930s with annually or semi-annually recurring friendlies between some of them.

Sweden tried to play friendly games against the Soviet Union in the 1940s, but it did not come to be until the mid 1950s.

===Nordic Games===
Bandy was played as one of the sports at the Nordic Games, international winter sports events held during the first few decades of the 20th century.

===International federation===
The FÃ©dÃ©ration internationale de hockey sur glace, or International Ice Hockey Federation as it is more well known as today, was founded in 1908 and was governing some bandy competitions in its early years, before only concentrating on ice hockey.
The Federation of International Bandy (FIB) was formed as &quot;International Bandy Federation&quot; in 1955 and has had 33 members at most, each representing a country where bandy is played. Currently, there are 27 members of the federation. The name of the federation was changed to the present one in 2001 after the International Olympic Committee approved it as a so-called &quot;recognized sport&quot;. The abbreviation &quot;IBF&quot; was at the time already used by another recognized sports federation, and IOC considers it important that the official abbreviations of sports federations are unique, so that the federations are not mistaken for one another.

In 2004, FIB was fully accepted by IOC. FIB is now a member of Association of IOC Recognised International Sports Federations.

===World Championships===

====Men====
The Bandy World Championship for men is arranged by the FIB and was first held in 1957. It was held every two years starting in 1961, and every year since 2003.

Currently, the record number of countries participating in the World Championships is twenty (2019). Since the number of countries playing bandy is not large, every country which can set up a team is welcome to take part in the World Championship. The quality of the teams varies; however, with only six nations, Sweden, the Soviet Union, Russia, Finland, Norway, and Kazakhstan, having won medals (allowing for the fact that Russia&#x27;s team took over from the Soviet Union in 1993). Finland won the 2004 world championship in VÃ¤sterÃ¥s, Sweden, while all other championships have been won by Sweden, the Soviet Union and Russia.

The Soviet Union won all championships until 1981, when Sweden managed to break the streak of eleven straight gold medals. Sweden won again in the next tournament in 1983, but Soviet again seized the victory in 1985. The Soviet Union also won at its last two appearances, and then Sweden won in 1993, 1995 and 1997. Russia, having taken over after the Soviet Union, and Sweden have kept on winning all championships between them except for 2004, when Finland managed to claim the win.

In 2020, the B division of the World Championship was played, but the A division â which was to be played about a month later â was first postponed a couple of times due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and later moved to the next year as the pandemic did not end. The championship tournament could however not be played in 2021 either. In 2022, the championship was finally to be held, but since it was scheduled to be played in Russia, many national federations said they did not want to participate because of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and it was cancelled by the FIB since this meant there would have been too few competing teams.

====Women====

The first World Championship for women took place in February 2004 in Lappeenranta, Finland. Sweden won the championship without conceding a goal. In the 2014 women&#x27;s World Championship Russia won for the first time, defeating Sweden, making it the first time Sweden did not win the world title. In 2016 Sweden took the title back.

The 2018 women&#x27;s tournament was played in a country situated completely in Asia for the first time, when it was hosted in Chengde, China. It was the same for the men&#x27;s tournament that same year (the area north and west of the Ural River is located in Europe, thus Kazakhstan, which had hosted a world championship before, is a transcontinental country), when Harbin hosted the 2018 Division B tournament.

The 2020 championship saw China withdraw its participation due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the tournament was held in Norway in February and the pandemic had not yet reached Europe. In 2022 when the championship was played in Sweden, China did not yet return, while Russia and Ukraine both withdrew because of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

====Youth====
There are also Youth Bandy World Championships in different age groups for boys and young men and in one age group for girls. The oldest group is the under 23 championship, Bandy World Championship Y-23.

===Olympic Movement===
During most of the 20th century, a host nation for Olympic Games had the right to arrange demonstration games for almost any sport of its own choosing. In 1952, the Winter Olympic Games were arranged in Oslo, Norway, and the Norwegians presented bandy as a demonstration sport. The tournament of bandy at the 1952 Winter Olympics was played by three countries, Norway, Finland and Sweden. This is the only time bandy has been played at Olympic Games.

Bandy was officially recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) under the Association of IOC Recognised International Sports Federations (ARISF) in 2004, and was played as a demonstration sport at the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo. However, it has yet to officially be played at the Olympics.

According to the FIB, bandy is the world&#x27;s second-most participated winter sport after ice hockey based on the number of participating athletes. It is unclear how many of the players participate in the male category and how many in the female category. The FIB has also recorded bandy (men&#x27;s) as having ranked as the number two winter sport in terms of tickets sold per day of competitions at the sport&#x27;s world championship.

However, compared with the seven Winter Olympic sports, bandy&#x27;s popularity among other winter sports across the globe is considered by the International Olympic Committee to have a, &quot;gap between popularity and participation and global audiences&quot;, which is a roadblock to future Olympic inclusion.

In addition, the Olympic Charter requires a sport to be widely practiced by men in at least 75 countries and on four continents, and by women in no fewer than 40 countries and on three continents in order to be accepted.

FIB president Boris Skrynnik lobbied for bandy to be included in the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, given Russia&#x27;s prominence in the sport. Members of the Chinese Olympic Committee were present at the 2017 world championships to meet with Skrynnik about the possibility of considering the sport for the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. However, in 2018 it was announced no new sports would be added for 2022.

====Asian Winter Games====

At the 2011 Asian Winter Games, open to members of the Olympic Council of Asia, men&#x27;s bandy was included for the first time. Three teams contested the inaugural competition, and Kazakhstan won the gold medal. The President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, attended the final.

There was no bandy competition at the next Games, the 2017 Asian Winter Games held in Japan.

===Winter Universiade/Winter World University Games===
Bandy made its debut at the Winter Universiade during the 2019 Games in Krasonyarsk, Russia. Originally a six-team tournament for men and a four-team tournament for women were planned to be held. However, later China withdrew from the men&#x27;s tournament and was supposed to be replaced by Belarus. Since that did not happen either, participating teams among women were Russia, Sweden, Norway and the United States, while among men Russia, Sweden, Norway, Finland and Kazakhstan.

In 2019, the International University Sports Federation expected bandy to be a part of the 2023 Winter World University Games (Winter World University Games being the new name of the Winter Universiade) too, however, this did not turn out to be so, as the hosts in Lake Placid, USA, did not included it in its schedules and no bandy teams were invited to the games.

===World Cup===
The World Championships should not be confused with the annual Bandy World Cup competitions. The World Cup is for club teams.

====Men====
The Bandy World Cup for men in Ljusdal, Sweden, has been played annually since the 1970s and is the biggest bandy tournament for elite-level club teams. It is played indoors in Sandviken since 2009 because Ljusdal has no indoor arena. It is expected to return to Ljusdal once an indoor arena has been built. World Cup matches are played day and night, and the tournament is played in four days in late October. The teams participating are mostly, and some years exclusively, from Sweden and Russia, which has the two best leagues in the world.

The COVID-19 pandemic led to the Cup being cancelled in 2020 and 2021.

====Women====
There is also a club competition for women&#x27;s bandy teams called Bandy World Cup Women. Its inaugural year was in 2007.

===European Cup===
The European Cup was first played in 1974 and was a competition featuring the national men&#x27;s champion team from any European country which had a national bandy championship. This meant, at the time, that only four teams competed every year, which were the men&#x27;s champions from Finland, Norway, the Soviet Union, and Sweden. After the Soviet Union had been dissolved in 1991, the Russian champions took part instead. The cup is not formally defunct, but the last installment was played in 2009.

===4 Nations Tournament===
The Federation of International Bandy usually arranges a four nations tournament every year between national teams from Norway, Finland, Russia and Sweden. The 2022 tournament was originally set for 21â23 January, but was cancelled after the Swedish Bandy Association announced they would not be hosting it for that season.

===Rossiya Tournament (Russian Government Cup)===
During the period 1972â1990, the Rossiya Tournament was held semi-annually for national teams in the years when there was no world championship. This tournament was always played in the Soviet Union and arranged by the newspaper &quot;Sovetskaya Rossiya&quot;. It was affectionately called &quot;the small world championship&quot;. From 1992 the tournament was renamed Russian Government Cup. The last instalment was played in 2012.

==Overview of international competitions==
There are several existing international bandy competitions with events varying based upon age, competitive level, and sex.

===Senior===
===Junior===
==Variants of bandy and sports developed from bandy==
===7-a-side bandy===
Varieties of bandy exist, utilising the same rules only with slight differences, like seven-a-side bandy with regulation sized goal cages but without corner strokes and often on a smaller sized rink. Seven-a-side bandy was popular in central Europe and in England in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, while eleven-a-side bandy was preferred in the Nordic countries and in Russia. Seven-a-side bandy rules were applied at the Davos Cup in 2016.

===Rink bandy===
Rink bandy is a bandy variant played on an ice hockey-size rink. It was originally conceived as a way of practicing bandy in the summertime, when there were no bandy sized indoor rinks but ice hockey rinks had started to be built indoors. Rink bandy is played by basically the same rules as regular bandy but on a playing surface the size of an ice hockey rink with ice hockey goal cages and six players on each team (or five in the case of the USA Rink Bandy League).

There have been international competitions for rink bandy played by the best bandy players in the 1980s and 1990s, both for club teams and for national teams, there were world championships in rink bandy in those days and the Hofors World Cup for clubs was played annually from 1984 to 1998. When more indoor bandy rinks have been built, rink bandy has more become a sport for lower league teams and recreational play.

Rink bandy was played in the 2012 European Company Sports Games program.

Some member nations of the Federation of International Bandy, which is the international governing body for rink bandy as well as bandy, do not have regulation sized bandy surfaces which are larger than the more common ice hockey ice rink and therefore only play rink bandy at home; this includes most of the World Championships Group B participants.

===Short bandy===
In Czechia, the national federation has developed its own version of rink bandy with somewhat different rules, which is meant to help the players transition to playing on a full-sized bandy rink. This is called short bandy. Read more in the section on Czechia below.

===Rinkball===
Rink bandy has in turn led to the creation of the sport of rinkball. The sport of rinkball has at times been referred to as a variant of bandy, however it organized by the 1980s and has since become an established organized sport with its own governing body and differs considerably from both bandy and ice hockey, the sport&#x27;s two major influences.

===Floorball===
Bandy is also the predecessor of floorball, which was invented when people started playing with plastic bandy shaped sticks and lightweight balls when running on the floors of indoor gym halls.â£

===Landbandy===
In Sweden, informal games played like bandy but on ice-free ground (usually on gravel or asphalt concrete) are called &quot;landbandy&quot; (see landbandy at the Swedish language Wikipedia).

===No roller or parasport variants exist===
There is no formal roller sport companion to bandy involving either inline skates or parallel wheel roller skates, even if rink hockey can be considered to have some similarities with bandy. There is also no formally organized skateless ice variant of bandy, and bandy does not have any parasport variant.

==Countries==
===Canada===
Bandy has been played in Canada since the 1980s, but is not nearly as popular as ice hockey in this country. Friendlies are played against the United States. The Canadian bandy federation is called Canada Bandy.

===China===
The China Bandy Federation was set up in 2014. Since them, China has since participated in a number of world championship tournaments, with men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s and youth teams. China Bandy is mainly financed by private resources. The development of the sport in China is supported by the Harbin Sport University.

===Czechia===
A team from Prague in present-day Czechia became Austrian national bandy champions in 1911.

Czechia has been playing in the World Championship since 2016. As a way of preparing as well as possible for international matches, the Czechs have invented modified rules for games on ice hockey rinks, a variety called short bandy, which differs from rink bandy. The Czech (former rink bandy) national league is now called &quot;Liga ÄeskÃ©ho nÃ¡rodnÃ­ho bandy&quot;.

===Estonia===
Bandy as an organized sport was played in Estonia in the 1910s to 1930s and the country had a national championship for some years. The national team played friendlies against Finland in the 1920s and 1930s. The sport was played sporadically during the Soviet occupation 1944â1991. It has since then become more organized again, partly through exchange with Finnish clubs and enthusiasts. As of 2018, Estonia takes part in both the Bandy World Championship for men, and the Women&#x27;s Bandy World Championship.

===Finland===
Bandy as an organized sport was introduced to Finland from Russia in the 1890s. Finland has been playing bandy friendlies against Sweden and Estonia since its independence in 1917.

The first men&#x27;s Finnish national championships were held in 1908 and was the first national Finnish championship held in any team sport. National champions have been named every year except for three years in the first half of the 20th century when Finland was at war. The top national league is called Bandyliiga and is semi-professional. The best players turn fully professional by being recruited by clubs in Sweden or Russia. As of the 2020â21 season, Bandyliiga consisted of the following teams: Akilles, Botnia-69, HIFK, JPS, Kampparit, NarukerÃ¤, OLS, VeiterÃ¤ and WP 35.

Finland was an original member of the Federation of International Bandy and is the only country besides Russia/Soviet Union and Sweden to have won a Bandy World Championship, which it did in 2004.

The Federation of International Bandy (FIB) is planning for a major premiere for indoor bandy in Finland in 2023 with the venue taking place at an indoor arena in Lappeenranta. When the arena is ready, an international inauguration is to take place with a 4-nation bandy tournament. Participants will include teams from Russia, Sweden, Norway and Finland. The tournament is scheduled for 20â22 January 2023.

===Germany===

Bandy was played in Germany in the early 20th century, including by Crown Prince Wilhelm, but the interest died out in favour of ice hockey. The Leipziger Sportclub, which arguably had the best team, was also the last club to give bandy up. The sport was reintroduced to Germany in the 2010s, with the German Bandy Federation being founded in 2013. Germany has been participating in the Bandy World Championship, a competition for male competitors, since 2014.

===India===

Bandy is being played in northern parts of India close to the Himalayas, where there is usually cold weather and snow in the winter time. A national championship is contested every year, but India has yet to send a national team to the World Championships or any other international competition.

===Kazakhstan===
Bandy has a long history in many parts of Kazakhstan and it used to be one of the most popular sports in Soviet times. However, after independence it suffered a rapid decline in popularity and only remained in Oral (often called by the Russian name, &quot;Uralsk&quot;), where the country&#x27;s only professional club Akzhaiyk is located. They presently compete in the Russian second tier division, the Russian Bandy Supreme League.

Recently bandy has started to gain popularity again outside of Oral, most notably in Petropavl and Khromtau. Those were for example the three Kazakh cities which had players in the team at the Youth-17, Youth Bandy World Championship for boys in 2016. The capital Astana has hosted national youth championships in rink bandy as well as championships in traditional eleven-a-side bandy.

In recent years the former capital Almaty has hosted both the Asian Winter Games (with bandy on the program) as well as the Bandy World Championship for men in which Kazakhstan finished 3rd. Plans are being made to reinvigorate the bandy section of the club Dynamo Almaty, who won the Soviet Championships in 1977 and 1990 as well as the European Cup in 1978. Almaty is also the home of the headquarters of the Asian Bandy Federation. Since bandy began regaining popularity and acceptance, the state has begun supporting bandy. Medeu in Almaty is the only arena with artificial ice. A second arena in Almaty was built for the World Championship 2012, but it was taken down afterwards. Stadion Yunost in Oral was supposed to get artificial ice for the 2017â18 season. It got delayed but in 2018 it was officially ready for use.

===Mongolia===
The national team took a silver medal at the 2011 Asian Winter Games, which led to being chosen as the best Mongolian sport team of 2011. Mongolia was proud to win the bronze medal of the B division at the 2017 Bandy World Championship after which the President of Mongolia, Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, held a reception for the team.

===Netherlands===
Bandy as an organized sport was introduced to the Netherlands in the 1890s by Pim Mulier and the sport became popular. However, in the 1920s, the interest turned to ice hockey, but in contrast to other countries in central and western Europe, the sport has been continuously played in the Netherlands and since the 1970s, the country has become a member of FIB and games have been more formalised again. The national team started to compete at the WCS in 1991. However, without a proper venue, only rink bandy is played within the country. The national governing body is the Bandy Bond Nederland.

===Norway===
Bandy as an organized sport was introduced to Norway in the 1910s. The Swedes contributed largely and clubs sprang up around the capital of Kristiania (present day Oslo). Oslo, including neighbouring towns, is in the twenty-first century still the region where bandy enjoys most popularity in Norway.

In 1912 the Norwegians played their first National Championship, which was played annually up to 1940. During World War II, when Norway was occupied by Germany, illegal bandy was played in hidden places in forests, on ponds and lakes. In 1943, 1944 and 1945, illegal championships were held. In 1946 legal play resumed and still goes on in form of the Norwegian Bandy Premier League (&quot;Eliteserien&quot;). After World War II the number of teams rose, as well as attendance which regularly were in the thousands, but mild winters in the 1970s and 1980s shrunk the league, and in 2003 only five clubs (teams) fought out the 1st division with low attendance numbers and little media coverage. As of 2021 there are 10 teams in the Norwegian Bandy Premier League.

Norway&#x27;s best result in the World Championship is a second place in 1965.

====Norwegian Championship====
The Norwegian bandy champion is decided each year by a play-off among the best teams in the Norwegian Bandy Premier League. The first Norwegian bandy champions was decided in 1912 and the championship has been held almost every year since. Until 1928, the championship was played as 7-a-side bandy.
===Russia===

In Russia bandy is known as hockey with a ball or simply Russian hockey. A similar game became popular among the Russian nobility in the early 1700s, with the imperial court of Peter the Great playing a predecessor of modern bandy on Saint Petersburg&#x27;s frozen Neva river. Russians initially played this game using ordinary footwear with sticks made out of juniper wood, but it wasn&#x27;t until later that ice skates were introduced. Bandy did not become popular among the masses throughout the Russian Empire until the second half of the 19th century. The predecessor of the current Russian Bandy Federation was founded in 1898. Bandy is considered a national sport in Russia and is the only discipline to have official support of the Russian Orthodox Church.

Traditionally the Russians used a longer skate blade than other nations, giving them the advantage of skating faster. However, they would find it more difficult to turn quickly. A bandy skate has a longer blade than an ice hockey skate, and the &quot;Russian skate&quot; is even longer.

Though bandy was still played in the Soviet Union after the Russian Revolution, they did not partake in any international games for many decades. While agreements had previously been made to play friendlies against Sweden in the late 1940s, these plans had not come to fruition. The bandy event at the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo, Norway where men&#x27;s bandy featured as a demonstration sport, was played without any Soviet team. However, the Soviets reconsidered their position following this competition.

When the Federation of International Bandy was formed in 1955, with the Soviet Union as one of its founding members, the Russians largely adopted the international rules of the game developed in England in the 19th century, with one notable exception. The other countries adopted the border which until then had only been used in Russia.

Since the 1950s, when the Soviet Union ended its isolation and started to take part in international sports events, the Soviet Union and then Russia (as its successor country in 1991) has consistently held a top position in the sport of bandy, both as a founding nation of the International Federation in 1955, and fielding the most successful team in the Bandy World Championship, the premiere international competition for men, (when counting the previous Soviet Union team and Russia together).

The men&#x27;s Russian professional bandy league is called the Russian Bandy Super League. The Russian Bandy Supreme League is the second tier of men&#x27;s Russian bandy, below the Russian Bandy Super League. In Sweden, the Elitserien (literally, the &quot;Elite League&quot;) is the highest bandy league in the country for men, while Bandyallsvenskan is the second division. In Finland, the highest bandy league for men is the Bandyliiga.
In a similar fashion, Russia, along with Sweden, has emerged as one of the two dominant women&#x27;s bandy nations internationally, regularly placing first or second at the premier international bandy competition for women, the Women&#x27;s Bandy World Championship.

After the victory in the 2016 World Championship, the fourth in a row, President Vladimir Putin received four players of the national team, Head Coach and Vice-President of the Russian Bandy Federation Sergey Myaus, the Russian Bandy Federation as well as Federation of International Bandy President Boris Skrynnik in The Kremlin. He talked, among other things, about the need to give more support to Russian bandy. It was the first time a head of state had accepted a meeting to talk about Russian bandy. Attending the meeting were also Minister of Sport, Tourism and Youth policy Vitaly Mutko and presidential adviser Igor Levitin. The month after, Igor Levitin held a follow-up meeting.

====Russian Championship====
The men&#x27;s Russian professional bandy league is called the Russian Bandy Super League. The Russian Bandy Supreme League is the second tier of men&#x27;s Russian bandy, below the Russian Bandy Super League.

The Russian Bandy Super League is the top tier of the Russian bandy league system. It is professional and played every year. The winner in the final becomes Russian champion. It is considered a continuation of the Soviet Union championship, which was played annually until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.

====Russian Cup====
The Russian Cup has been played annually most years since 1937, originally called the Soviet Cup.

===Sweden===
Bandy as an organized sport was introduced to Sweden in 1895. The Swedish royal family, noblemen and diplomats were among the first players. While the original inspiration mainly came from England, there also were early exchanges with Germany and Russia. Bandy was taken up as one of the sports at the international Nordic Games held in Sweden semi-annually from 1901. Swedish championships for men have been played annually since 1907 and Sweden was the first country to have an annual bandy league.

In the 1920s students played the game, then it spread across the country and became a largely middle-class sport. The games could attract huge crowds of spectators in those days. After Slottsbrons IF won the Swedish championship in 1934 it became popular amongst workers in many smaller industrial towns and villages. Where there was a bandy club the local factory corporation also usually sponsored the club to mutual benefit as a successful team led to good PR for the company. Bandy remains the main sport in many of these places.

Bandy in Sweden is famous for its &quot;culture&quot; where both playing bandy and being a spectator requires great fortitude and dedication. A &quot;&quot; is the classic accessory for spectating and is typically made of brown leather, well worn, and contains a warm drink in a thermos and/or a bottle of liquor. Bandy is most often played at outdoor arenas during winter time, so the need for spectators to carry flasks or thermoses of &#x27;warming&#x27; liquid like glÃ¶gg is a natural effect. With the sport moving indoors in recent decades and the arenas urging for non-alcoholic policies for the audiences, this tradition has partly changed, though not without opposition.


A notable tradition is &quot;annandagsbandy&quot;, bandy games played on Saint Stephen&#x27;s Day (&quot;annandagen&quot; = âthe second day [of Christmas]â), which for many Swedes is an important Christmas season tradition and always draws bigger crowds than usual. Games traditionally begin at 1:15Â pm.

====Swedish Championship====
In Sweden, the Elitserien (literally, the &quot;Elite League&quot;) is the highest bandy league in the country for men, while Bandyallsvenskan is the second division. The Elite League is the top tier of Swedish bandy and is fully professional. At the end of the season, a play-off is made to make out the two teams playing the final match for the Swedish Championship. The Final is played every year on the third Saturday of March. From 1991 to 2012, it was played at Studenternas Idrottsplats in Uppsala, often drawing crowds in excess of 20,000. One reason the play-off match was set in Uppsala is because of IFK Uppsala&#x27;s success at the beginning of the 20th century. IFK Uppsala won 11 titles in the Swedish Championships between 1907 and 1920, which made them the most successful bandy club in the entire country (now, however, the record is held by VÃ¤sterÃ¥s SK). A contributing factor was also the poor quality of the ice at SÃ¶derstadion, where the finals were held from 1967 to 1989.

In 2013 and 2014 the final was played indoors in Friends Arena, the national stadium for football in Solna, Stockholm, with a retractable roof and a capacity of 50,000. The first final at Friends Arena in 2013 drew a record crowd of 38,474 when Hammarby IF Bandy, after ending up in second place in six finals during the 2000s, won their second title. Due to declining attendance from 2015 through 2017 Tele2 Arena in southern Stockholm was chosen as a new venue. However, the new indoor venue failed to attract much more than half of the total capacity. In May 2017 it was announced that the finals will again be held at Studenternas IP in Uppsala from 2018 through at least 2021.

====Svenska Cupen (The Swedish Cup)====

The &quot;Svenska Cupen&quot; (), &quot;Svenska Cupen i bandy&quot;, takes place exclusively in Sweden. It is a single-elimination tournament competition in Swedish bandy and the second-most prominent bandy competition which is open only to domestic Swedish teams, after the national championship. Its inaugural year was 2005. The first women&#x27;s competition was played in 2019.

===Switzerland===
In the late nineteenth and early 20th century, Switzerland had become a popular place for winter vacations and people went there from all over Europe. Winter sports like skiing, sledding and bandy was played in Geneva and other towns. Students from Oxford and Cambridge went to Switzerland to play each other â the predecessor of the recurring Ice Hockey Varsity Match was a bandy match played in St. Moritz in 1885. This popularity for Swiss venues of winter sport may have been a reason, the European Championship was held there in 1913.

Bandy has mainly been played as a recreational sport in Switzerland in the 2000s and 2010s. A Swiss men&#x27;s national team was finally started up in 2017 and a Swiss women&#x27;s national team made its international dÃ©but in the 2018 Women&#x27;s Bandy World Championship.

===Ukraine===
Bandy was played in Ukraine when it was part of the Soviet Union. After independence in 1991, it took some years before organized bandy formed again, but Ukrainian champions have been named annually since 2012.

===United Kingdom===
The first recorded games of what may be considered bandy on ice took place in The Fens during the great frost of 1813â1814, although it is probable that the game had already been played there in the previous century. Bury Fen Bandy Club from Bluntisham-cum-Earith, near St Ives, was the most successful team, said to have remained unbeaten for a hundred years until the winter of 1890â1891. Charles Goodman Tebbutt of the Bury Fen Bandy Club was responsible for the first published rules of bandy in 1882, and also for introducing the game into the Netherlands and Sweden, as well as elsewhere in England where it became popular with cricket, rowing, and hockey clubs. Tebbutt&#x27;s homemade bandy stick can be seen in the Norris Museum in St Ives.

The first Ice Hockey Varsity Matches between Oxford University and Cambridge University were played to bandy rules, even if it was called hockey on the ice at the time.

It is sometimes claimed that a national team for England won the European Bandy Championships in 1913, but that tournament likely never took place. While bandy is often thought to have been a popular sport in England in the decades around 1900, few records seem to have been kept.

A statue of a bandy player, designed by Peter Baker, was erected at the village pond of Earith to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the first documented game in 2013.

In March 2004, Norwegian ex-player Edgar Malman invited two big clubs to play a rink bandy exhibition game in Streatham, London. Russian Champions and World Cup Winner Vodnik met Swedish Champions Edsbyns IF in a match that ended 10â10. In 2010 England became a Federation of International Bandy member. The national federation is based in Cambridgeshire, the historical heartland.

The England Bandy Federation, was set up on 2 January 2017 at a meeting held in the historic old skaters public house, the Lamb and Flag in Welney in Norfolk, England, replacing the Bandy Federation of England which had been founded in 2010 but had had dwindling activity. In September 2017, the federation decided to widen its territory to all of the United Kingdom and changed its name to Great Britain Bandy Association. Great Britain entered a national team in the 2019 World Championships Group B in January and undefeated up to the final, won the silver medal in their final match against Estonia. They were set to return to the 2020 World Championships, but were refused visas to Russia. Since then they have not participated. However, the comeback will come in 2025.

In 2022, Great Britain premiered its national women&#x27;s bandy team at the 2022 Women&#x27;s Bandy World Championship.

===United States===

Bandy in its original, informal manner disappeared from the North American continent entirely once it and elements from the early game had become absorbed into a new sport of ice hockey. While ice hockey was growing and organizing in the United States, bandy was doing the same, but only in Europe and Scandinavia. It would not arrive in its organized format in the United States until the 1970s, almost a century after its initial development.

Bandy has been played in the United States since around the 1970s, after its promotion by Russians, Swedes and Finns in an exchange with softball, a sport which was promoted by Americans during the same time in the Soviet Union, Sweden and Finland. A key-person in the establishment of the sport in America was Bob Kojetin of Minnesota Softball. The sport is centered in Minnesota, with very few teams based elsewhere. The United States national bandy team has participated in the Bandy World Championships since 1985 and is also regularly playing friendly matches against Canada. The leading organization for bandy in the US is USA Bandy. The US has a men&#x27;s national bandy team and a women&#x27;s national bandy team.

The first bandy game in the US was played in December 1979 at the Lewis Park Bandy Rink in Edina, Minnesota. It was a friendly game between the Swedish junior national team and Swedish club team Brobergs IF.

United States bandy championships have been played annually since the early 1980s, but the sport is not widely covered by American sports media. The championship trophy is called the Gunnar Cup, named after Gunnar Fast, a Swedish army captain who helped introduce bandy to the United States around 1980.

====Playing surfaces====
While North American ice hockey rinks can be used for playing the bandy variant of rink bandy, places where the traditional game of bandy can be played require a larger sized playing surface, a bandy field, and are almost non-existent in North America. Minnesota is home to the only regulation sized bandy &quot;rink&quot; in North America, the Guidant John Rose Minnesota Oval, commonly referred to as, &quot;The Oval&quot;, and is also the largest outdoor refrigerated skating rink in North America. The rink is 10,219 square meters with more than 800 tons of refrigeration and 135 km of pipes underneath the ice. The ice can be maintained in temperatures up to +10 degrees Celsius. The Oval can hold up to 300 spectators and has hosted World Cup Speedskating, the 2016 Women&#x27;s Bandy World Championship, and Aggressive Skating/Biking competitions. The Oval is used mostly for inline hockey during the summer.

<doc id="4446" wikidata="Q160082" url="?curid=4446" title="Booker Prize">
<text>The Booker Prize, formerly the Booker Prize for Fiction (1969â2001) and the Man Booker Prize (2002â2019), is a prestigious literary award conferred each year for the best single work of sustained fiction written in the English language, which was published in the United Kingdom or Ireland. The winner of the Booker Prize receives , as well as international publicity that usually leads to a significant sales boost. When the prize was created, only novels written by Commonwealth, Irish, and South African (and later Zimbabwean) citizens were eligible to receive the prize; in 2014, eligibility was widened to any English-language novelâa change that proved controversial.

A five-person panel consisting of authors, publishers and journalists, as well as politicians, actors, artists and musicians, is appointed by the Booker Prize Foundation each year to choose the winning book. Gaby Wood has been the chief executive of the Booker Prize Foundation since 2015.

A high-profile literary award in British culture, the Booker Prize is greeted with anticipation and fanfare around the world. Literary critics have noted that it is a mark of distinction for authors to be selected for inclusion in the shortlist or to be nominated for the &quot;longlist&quot;.

A sister prize, the International Booker Prize, is awarded for a work of fiction translated into English and published in the United Kingdom or Ireland. Unlike the Booker Prize, short story collections are eligible for the International Booker Prize. The Â£50,000 prize money is split evenly between the author and translator of the winning novel.

==History and administration==
The prize was established as the &quot;Booker Prize for Fiction&quot; after the company Booker, McConnell Ltd began sponsoring the event in 1969; it became commonly known as the &quot;Booker Prize&quot; or the &quot;Booker&quot;. Jock Campbell, Charles Tyrrell and Tom Maschler were instrumental in establishing the prize. 

When administration of the prize was transferred to the Booker Prize Foundation in 2002, the title sponsor became the investment company Man Group, which opted to retain &quot;Booker&quot; as part of the official title of the prize. The foundation is an independent registered charity funded by the entire profits of Booker Prize Trading Ltd, of which it is the sole shareholder. The prize money awarded with the Booker Prize was originally Â£5,000. It doubled in 1978 to Â£10,000 and was subsequently raised to Â£50,000 in 2002 under the sponsorship of the Man Group, making it one of the world&#x27;s richest literary prizes. Each of the shortlisted authors receives Â£2,500 and a specially bound edition of their book.

The original Booker Prize trophy was designed by the artist Jan PieÅkowski and the design was revived for the 2023 prize.

===1969â1979===
The first winner of the Booker Prize was P. H. Newby in 1969 for his novel &quot;Something to Answer For&quot;. W. L. Webb, &quot;The Guardian&quot;â³s Literary Editor, was chair of the inaugural set of judges, which included Rebecca West, Stephen Spender, Frank Kermode and David Farrer.

In 1970, the prize&#x27;s second year, Bernice Rubens became the first woman to win the Booker Prize, for &quot;The Elected Member&quot;.

The rules of the Booker changed in 1971; previously, it had been given retrospectively, to books published in the year prior to each award. In 1971, eligibility was changed to make the year of a novel&#x27;s publication the same as the year of the award, which was made in November; in effect, this meant that books published in 1970 were not considered for the Booker in either year. Forty years later, the Booker Prize Foundation announced in January 2010 the creation of a special award called the &quot;Lost Man Booker Prize&quot;, with the winner chosen from a longlist of 22 novels published in 1970. The prize was won by J. G. Farrell for &quot;Troubles&quot;, though the author had died in 1979.

In 1972, winning writer John Berger, known for his Marxist worldview, protested during his acceptance speech against Booker McConnell. He blamed Booker&#x27;s 130 years of sugar production in the Caribbean for the region&#x27;s modern poverty. Berger donated half of his Â£5,000 prize to the British Black Panther movement, because it had a socialist and revolutionary perspective in agreement with his own.

===1980â1999===
In 1980, Anthony Burgess, writer of &quot;Earthly Powers&quot;, refused to attend the ceremony unless it was confirmed to him in advance whether he had won. His was one of two books considered likely to win, the other being &quot;Rites of Passage&quot; by William Golding. The judges decided only 30 minutes before the ceremony, giving the prize to Golding. Both novels had been seen as favourites to win leading up to the prize, and the dramatic &quot;literary battle&quot; between two senior writers made front-page news.

Alice Munro&#x27;s &quot;The Beggar Maid&quot; was shortlisted in 1980, and remains the only short-story collection to be shortlisted.

In 1981, nominee John Banville wrote a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; requesting that the prize be given to him so that he could use the money to buy every copy of the longlisted books in Ireland and donate them to libraries, &quot;thus ensuring that the books not only are bought but also readÂ â surely a unique occurrence&quot;.

Judging for the 1983 award produced a draw between J. M. Coetzee&#x27;s &quot;Life &amp; Times of Michael K&quot; and Salman Rushdie&#x27;s &quot;Shame&quot;, leaving chair of judges Fay Weldon to choose between the two. According to Stephen Moss in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;Her arm was bent and she chose Rushdie&quot;, only to change her mind as the result was being phoned through. At the award ceremony, Fay Weldon used her speech to attack the assembled publishers, accusing them of exploiting and undervaluing authors. &quot;I will ask you if in your dealings with authors you are really being fair, and honourable, and right? Or merely getting away with what you can? If you are not careful, you will kill the goose that lays your golden eggs.&quot;

In 1992, the jury split the prize between Michael Ondaatje&#x27;s &quot;The English Patient&quot; and Barry Unsworth&#x27;s &quot;Sacred Hunger&quot;. This prompted the foundation to draw up a rule that made it mandatory for the appointed jury to make the award to just a single author/book.

The choice of James Kelman&#x27;s book &quot;How Late It Was, How Late&quot; as 1994 Booker Prize winner proved to be one of the most controversial in the award&#x27;s history. Rabbi Julia Neuberger, one of the judges, declared it &quot;aÂ disgrace&quot; and left the event, later deeming the book to be &quot;crap&quot;; WHSmith&#x27;s marketing manager called the award &quot;an embarrassment to the whole book trade&quot;; Waterstones in Glasgow sold a mere 13 copies of Kelman&#x27;s book the following week. In 1994, &quot;The Guardian&quot;â³s literary editor Richard Gott, citing the lack of objective criteria and the exclusion of American authors, described the prize as &quot;aÂ significant and dangerous iceberg in the sea of British culture that serves as a symbol of its current malaise&quot;.

In 1996, A. L. Kennedy served as a judge; in 2001, she called the prize &quot;aÂ pile of crooked nonsense&quot; with the winner determined by &quot;who knows who, who&#x27;s sleeping with who, who&#x27;s selling drugs to who, who&#x27;s married to who, whose turn it is&quot;.

In 1997, the decision to award Arundhati Roy&#x27;s &quot;The God of Small Things&quot; proved controversial. Carmen Callil, chair of the previous year&#x27;s Booker judges, called it an &quot;execrable&quot; book and said on television that it should not even have been on the shortlist. Booker Prize chairman Martyn Goff said Roy won because nobody objected, following the rejection by the judges of Bernard MacLaverty&#x27;s shortlisted book due to their dismissal of him as &quot;aÂ wonderful short-story writer and that &quot;Grace Notes&quot; was three short stories strung together&quot;.

===2000â2019===

Before 2001, each year&#x27;s longlist of nominees was not publicly revealed. From 2001, the longlisted novels started to be published each year, and in 2007 the number of nominees was capped at 12 or 13 each year.

In 2001, Peter Carey become the first author to win the Booker Prize for a second time. Carey was the first of four writers to have won the Booker Prize twice, the others being J. M. Coetzee, Hilary Mantel, and Margaret Atwood.

The Booker Prize created a permanent home for the archives from 1968 to present at Oxford Brookes University Library. The Archive, which encompasses the administrative history of the Prize from 1968 to date, collects together a diverse range of material, including correspondence, publicity material, copies of both the Longlists and the Shortlists, minutes of meetings, photographs and material relating to the awards dinner (letters of invitation, guest lists, seating plans). Embargoes of ten or twenty years apply to certain categories of material; examples include all material relating to the judging process and the Longlist prior to 2002.

Between 2005 and 2008, the Booker Prize alternated between writers from Ireland and India. &quot;Outsider&quot; John Banville began this trend in 2005 when his novel &quot;The Sea&quot; was selected as a surprise winner: Boyd Tonkin, literary editor of &quot;The Independent&quot;, famously condemned it as &quot;possibly the most perverse decision in the history of the award&quot; and rival novelist Tibor Fischer poured scorn on Banville&#x27;s victory. Kiran Desai of India won in 2006. Anne Enright&#x27;s 2007 victory came about due to a jury split over Ian McEwan&#x27;s novel &quot;On Chesil Beach&quot;. The following year it was India&#x27;s turn again, with Aravind Adiga narrowly defeating Enright&#x27;s fellow Irishman Sebastian Barry.

Historically, the winner of the Booker Prize was required to be a citizen of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Republic of Ireland, or Zimbabwe. It was announced on 18 September 2013 that future Booker Prize awards would consider authors from anywhere in the world, so long as their work was in English and published in the United Kingdom or Ireland. This change proved controversial in literary circles. Former winner A. S. Byatt and former judge John Mullan said the prize risked diluting its identity, whereas former judge A. L. Kennedy welcomed the change. Following this expansion, the first winner not from the Commonwealth, Ireland, or Zimbabwe was American Paul Beatty in 2016. Another American, George Saunders, won the following year. In 2018, publishers sought to reverse the change, arguing that the inclusion of American writers would lead to homogenisation, reducing diversity and opportunities everywhere, including in America, to learn about &quot;great books that haven&#x27;t already been widely heralded&quot;.

Man Group announced in early 2019 that the year&#x27;s prize would be the last of eighteen under their sponsorship. A new sponsor, CrankstartÂ â a charitable foundation run by Sir Michael Moritz and his wife, Harriet HeymanÂ â then announced it would sponsor the award for five years, with the option to renew for another five years. The award title was changed to simply &quot;The Booker Prize&quot;.

In 2019, despite having been unequivocally warned against doing so, the foundation&#x27;s jury â under the chair Peter Florence â split the prize, awarding it to two authors, in breach of a rule established in 1993. Florence justified the decision, saying: &quot;We came down to a discussion with the director of the Booker Prize about the rules. And we were told quite firmly that the rules state that you can only have one winnerÂ ... and as we have managed the jury all the way through on the principle of consensus, our consensus was that it was our decision to flout the rules and divide this year&#x27;s prize to celebrate two winners.&quot; The two were British writer Bernardine Evaristo for her novel &quot;Girl, Woman, Other&quot; and Canadian writer Margaret Atwood for &quot;The Testaments&quot;. Evaristo&#x27;s win marked the first time the Booker had been awarded to a black woman, while Atwood&#x27;s win, at 79, made her the oldest winner. Atwood had also previously won the prize in 2000.

=== 2020âpresent ===

In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the annual award ceremony was replaced with a livestream from the Roundhouse in London, without the shortlisted authors in attendance. The winner was Douglas Stuart for his debut novel &quot;Shuggie Bain&quot;, which had been rejected by more than 30 publishers.

2021&#x27;s small-scale ceremony, once again impacted by COVID-19, saw South African writer Damon Galgut, who had been shortlisted in 2003 and 2010, win the prize for &quot;The Promise&quot;.

2022 saw a reimagined winner ceremony at the Roundhouse, hosted by comedian Sophie Duker and featuring a keynote speech by singer Dua Lipa. The prize was won by Sri Lankan author Shehan Karunatilaka for his second novel, &quot;The Seven Moons of Maali Almeida&quot;.

In 2023, for the first time, the shortlist featured three writers named Paul (Paul Lynch, Paul Murray and Paul Harding). The prize was won by Irish writer Paul Lynch for his novel &quot;Prophet Song&quot;. In the media, reaction was mixed. In &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Justine Jordan wrote that &quot;This is a novel written to jolt the reader awake to truths we mostly cannot bear to admit&quot;, while in &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, Cal Revely-Calder wrote that &quot;Prophet Song&quot; is &quot;political fiction at its laziest&quot; and &quot;the weak link in a strong shortlist&quot;.

The 2024 prize was won by Samantha Harvey for &quot;Orbital&quot;, the first book set in space to win the prize and, at 136 pages, the second shortest book to win the Booker after Penelope Fitzgerald&#x27;s &quot;Offshore&quot;. Harvey was also the first woman to win the Booker since 2019. Since winning the Booker, &quot;Orbital&quot; became a UK bestseller, selling over 20,000 print copies in the UK in the week following its win, making it the fastest selling winner of the Booker Prize since records began. 

John Sutherland, who was a judge for the 1999 prize, was reported as saying in 2001:

==Judging==
The selection process for the winner of the prize commences with the appointment of a panel of five judges, which changes each year. Gaby Wood, the chief executive of the Booker Prize Foundation, chooses the judges in consultation with an advisory committee made up of senior figures from the UK publishing industry. On rare occasions a judge may be selected a second time. Judges are selected from amongst leading literary critics, writers, academics and leading public figures.

Unlike some other literary prizes, each judge is expected to read all of the books that have been submitted. (In 2023, the judges read 163 books over seven months.) After doing so, they select a longlist of 12 or 13 titles (the &quot;Booker Dozen&quot;), before each reading those books for a second time. They then select a shortlist of six titles, and read the six books a third time before selecting a winner.

The Booker judging process and the very concept of a &quot;best book&quot; being chosen by a small number of literary insiders is controversial for many. &quot;The Guardian&quot; introduced the &quot;Not the Booker Prize&quot; voted for by readers partly as a reaction to this.
Author Amit Chaudhuri wrote: &quot;The idea that a &#x27;book of the year&#x27; can be assessed annually by a bunch of people â judges who have to read almost a book a day â is absurd, as is the idea that this is any way of honouring a writer.&quot;

The author Julian Barnes once dismissed the prize as &quot;posh bingo&quot; for the apparently arbitrary way winners are selected. On winning the prize in 2011 he joked that he had revised his opinion, telling reporters that he had realised &quot;the judges are the wisest heads in literary Christendom&quot;.

For many years, the winner was announced at a formal, black-tie dinner in London&#x27;s Guildhall in early October. However, in 2020, with COVID-19 pandemic restrictions in place, the winner ceremony was broadcast in November from the Roundhouse, in partnership with the BBC. The ceremony returned to the Roundhouse for a more casual in-person ceremony in 2022, before moving to Old Billingsgate in London in 2023 and 2024.

==Winners==


==Special awards==
In 1971, the nature of the prize was changed so that it was awarded to novels published in that year instead of in the previous year; therefore, no novel published in 1970 could win the Booker Prize. This was rectified in 2010 by the awarding of the &quot;Lost Man Booker Prize&quot; to J. G. Farrell&#x27;s &quot;Troubles&quot;.

In 1993, a special Booker of Bookers prize was awarded to mark the prize&#x27;s 25th anniversary. Three previous judges of the award, Malcolm Bradbury, David Holloway and W. L. Webb, met and chose Salman Rushdie&#x27;s &quot;Midnight&#x27;s Children&quot;, the 1981 winner, as &quot;the best novel out of all the winners&quot;.

In 2006, the Man Booker Prize set up a &quot;Best of Beryl&quot; prize, for the author Beryl Bainbridge, who had been nominated five times and yet failed to win once. The prize is said to count as a Booker Prize. The nominees were &quot;An Awfully Big Adventure&quot;, &quot;Every Man for Himself&quot;, &quot;The Bottle Factory Outing&quot;, &quot;The Dressmaker&quot; and &quot;Master Georgie&quot;, which won.

Similarly, The Best of the Booker was awarded in 2008 to celebrate the prize&#x27;s 40th anniversary. A shortlist of six winners was chosen â Rushdie&#x27;s &quot;Midnight&#x27;s Children&quot;, Coetzee&#x27; &quot;Disgrace&quot;, Carey&#x27;s &quot;Oscar and Lucinda&quot;, Gordimer&#x27;s &quot;The Conservationist&quot;, Farrell&#x27;s &quot;The Siege of Krishnapur&quot;, and Barker&#x27;s &quot;The Ghost Road&quot; â and the decision was left to a public vote; the winner was again &quot;Midnight&#x27;s Children&quot;.

In 2018, to celebrate the 50th anniversary, the Golden Man Booker was awarded. One book from each decade was selected by a panel of judges: Naipaul&#x27;s &quot;In a Free State&quot; (the 1971 winner), Lively&#x27;s &quot;Moon Tiger&quot; (1987), Ondaatje&#x27;s &quot;The English Patient&quot; (1992), Mantel&#x27;s &quot;Wolf Hall&quot; (2009) and Saunders&#x27; &quot;Lincoln in the Bardo&quot; (2017). The winner, by popular vote, was &quot;The English Patient&quot;.

==Nomination==
Since 2014, each publisher&#x27;s imprint may submit a number of titles based on their longlisting history (previously they could submit two). Non-longlisted publishers can submit one title, publishers with one or two longlisted books in the previous five years can submit two, publishers with three or four longlisted books are allowed three submissions, and publishers with five or more longlisted books can have four submissions.

In addition, previous winners of the prize are automatically considered if they enter new titles. Books may also be called in: publishers can make written representations to the judges to consider titles in addition to those already entered. In the 21st century the average number of books considered by the judges has been approximately 130.

==Related awards for translated works==
A separate prize for which any living writer in the world may qualify, the Man Booker International Prize, was inaugurated in 2005. Until 2015, it was given every two years to a living author of any nationality for a body of work published in English or generally available in English translation. In 2016, the award was significantly reconfigured, and is now given annually to a single book in English translation, with a Â£50,000 prize for the winning title, shared equally between author and translator. The award has been known as the International Booker Prize since the Man Group ended its association with the prizes in 2019.

A Russian version of the Booker Prize was created in 1992 called the Booker-Open Russia Literary Prize, also known as the Russian Booker Prize. In 2007, Man Group plc established the Man Asian Literary Prize, an annual literary award given to the best novel by an Asian writer, either written in English or translated into English, and published in the previous calendar year.

For many years, as part of &quot;The Times&quot; Literature Festival in Cheltenham, a Booker event was held on the last Saturday of the festival. Four guest speakers/judges debated a shortlist of four books from a given year from before the introduction of the Booker Prize, and a winner was chosen. Unlike the real Booker Prize (1969 through 2014), writers from outside the Commonwealth were also considered. In 2008, the winner for 1948 was Alan Paton&#x27;s &quot;Cry, the Beloved Country&quot;, beating Norman Mailer&#x27;s &quot;The Naked and the Dead&quot;, Graham Greene&#x27;s &quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot; and Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s &quot;The Loved One&quot;. In 2015, the winner for 1915 was Ford Madox Ford&#x27;s &quot;The Good Soldier&quot;, beating &quot;The Thirty-Nine Steps&quot; (John Buchan), &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot; (W. Somerset Maugham), &quot;Psmith, Journalist&quot; (P. G. Wodehouse) and &quot;The Voyage Out&quot; (Virginia Woolf).

<text>The Book of Joel (Hebrew:×¡×¤×¨ ××Ö¹×Öµ×) is a Jewish prophetic text containing a series of &quot;divine announcements&quot;. The first line attributes authorship to &quot;Joel the son of Pethuel&quot;. It forms part of the Book of the twelve minor prophets or the Nevi&#x27;im (&quot;Prophets&quot;) in the Hebrew Bible, and is a book in its own right in the Christian Old Testament. In the New Testament, his prophecy of the outpouring of God&#x27;s Holy Spirit upon all people was notably quoted by Saint Peter in his Pentecost sermon.

The Book of Joelâs frequent allusions to earlier Hebrew Bible texts and signs of literary development suggest a late origin and its potential to have been a unifying piece within the prophetic canon.

== Surviving early manuscripts ==
The original text was written in Hebrew language.

Some early manuscripts containing the text of this book in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text tradition, which includes the Codex Cairensis (895 CE), the Petersburg Codex of the Prophets (916), Aleppo Codex (10th century), Codex Leningradensis (1008). Fragments containing parts of this book in Hebrew were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, including 4Q78 (4QXIIc; 75â50 BCE) with extant verses 1:10â20, 2:1, 2:8â23, and 3:6â21; and 4Q82 (4QXIIg; 25 BCE) with extant verses 1:12â14, 2:2â13, 3:4â9, 3:11â14, 3:17, 3:19â2; SchÃ¸yen MS 4612/1 (DSS F.117; DSS F.Joel1; 50â68 CE) with extant verses 3:1â4); and Wadi Murabba&#x27;at Minor Prophets (Mur88; MurXIIProph; 75â100 CE) with extant verses 2:20, 2:26â27, 2:28â32, and 3:1â16.

Ancient manuscripts in Koine Greek containing this book are mainly of the Septuagint version, including Codex Vaticanus (B; formula_1B; 4th century), Codex Sinaiticus (S; BHK: formula_1S; 4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (A; formula_1A; 5th century) and Codex Marchalianus (Q; formula_1Q; 6th century).

== Content ==
After the initial attribution, the book may be broken down into the following sections:
* Lament over a great locust plague and a severe drought (1:1â2:17).
** The effects of these events on agriculture, farmers, and on the supply of agricultural offerings for the Temple in Jerusalem, interspersed with a call to national lament (1:1â20).
** A more apocalyptic passage comparing the locusts to an army, and revealing that they are God&#x27;s army (2:1â11).
** A call to national repentance in the face of God&#x27;s judgment (2:12â17).
* Promise of future blessings (2:18â32 or 2:18â3:5).
** Banishment of the locusts and restoration of agricultural productivity as a divine response to national penitence (2:18â27).
** Future prophetic gifts to all of God&#x27;s people, and the safety of God&#x27;s people in the face of cosmic cataclysm (2:28â32 or 3:1â5).
* Coming judgment on the Kingdom of Judah&#x27;s enemies: the Philistines, the Kingdom of Edom, and the Kingdom of Egypt (3:1â21 or 4:1â21).

==Chapters==
The Book of Joel&#x27;s division into chapters and verses differs widely between editions of the Bible; some editions have three chapters, others four. Translations with four chapters include the Jewish Publication Society&#x27;s version of the Hebrew Bible (1917), the Jerusalem Bible (1966), New American Bible (Revised Edition, 1970), Complete Jewish Bible (1998), and Tree of Life Version (2015).

In the 1611 King James Bible, the Book of Joel is formed by three chapters: the second one has 32 verses, and it is equivalent to the union of the chapter 2 (with 27 verses) and chapter 3 (with 5 verses) of other editions of the Bible.

The differences of the divisions are as follows:
== Date ==
As there are no explicit references in the book to datable persons or events, scholars have assigned a wide range of dates to the book. The main positions are:
* Ninth century BC, particularly in the reign of Joash â a position especially popular among nineteenth-century scholars (making Joel one of the earliest writing prophets). The enemies mentioned â Philistines, Phoenicians, Egypt and Edom â are consistent with this date. The lack of mention of the Assyrians or Babylonians, who were the main enemies of Judah during the eighth, seventh and sixth centuries, leads many conservative scholars to suggest the choice is between this date, and a fourth century date. 
* Early eighth century BC, during the reign of Uzziah (contemporary with Hosea, Amos, and Jonah)
* c. 630â587 BC, in the last decades of the kingdom of Judah (contemporary with Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Habakkuk)
* c. 520â500 BC, contemporary with the return of the exiles and the careers of Zechariah and Haggai.
* The decades around 400 BC, during the Persian period (making him one of the latest writing prophets), or around 350 BC. This is supported by the apparent mention of the 587 BC destruction of Jerusalem as a past event in 3:1 and 3:17, and the mention of Greeks in 3:6.
* Some scholars argue that further additions to Joel took place during the Ptolemaic period (c. 301-201 BCE) due to its use of earlier texts and what they perceive to be a &quot;late&quot; perspective on Yahweh and the nations.

Evidence produced for these positions includes allusions in the book to the wider world, similarities with other prophets, and linguistic details. Some commentators, such as John Calvin, attach no great importance to the precise dating.

== History of interpretation ==

The Masoretic text places Joel between Hosea and Amos (the order inherited by the Tanakh and Old Testament), while the Septuagint order is HoseaâAmosâMicahâJoelâObadiahâJonah. The Hebrew text of Joel seems to have suffered little from scribal transmission, but is at a few points supplemented by the Septuagint, Syriac, and Vulgate versions, or by conjectural emendation. While the book purports to describe a plague of locusts, some ancient Jewish opinion saw the locusts as allegorical interpretations of Israel&#x27;s enemies. This allegorical interpretation was applied to the church by many church fathers. Calvin took a literal interpretation of chapter 1, but allegorical view of chapter 2, a position echoed by some modern interpreters. Most modern interpreters, however, see Joel speaking of a literal locust plague given a prophetic or apocalyptic interpretation.

The traditional ascription of the whole book to the prophet Joel was challenged in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries by a theory of a three-stage process of composition: 1:1â2:27 were from the hand of Joel, and dealt with a contemporary issue; 2:28â3:21/3:1â4:21 were ascribed to a continuator with an apocalyptic outlook. Mentions in the first half of the book to the day of the Lord were also ascribed to this continuator. 3:4â8/4:4â8 could be seen as even later. Details of exact ascriptions differed between scholars.

This splitting of the book&#x27;s composition began to be challenged in the mid-twentieth century, with scholars defending the unity of the book, the plausibility of the prophet combining a contemporary and apocalyptic outlook, and later additions by the prophet. The authenticity of 3:4â8 has presented more challenges, although a number of scholars still defend it.

== Biblical quotes and allusions ==
There are many parallels of language between Joel and other Old Testament prophets. They may represent Joel&#x27;s literary use of other prophets, or vice versa.

In the New Testament, his prophecy of the outpouring of God&#x27;s Holy Spirit upon all people was notably quoted by Saint Peter in his Pentecost sermon.

Joel 3:10 / 4:10 is a variation of Isaiah 2:4 and Micah 4:3&#x27;s prophecy, &quot;They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks&quot;, instead commanding, &quot;Beat your plowshares into swords and your pruning hooks into spears.&quot;

The table below represents some of the more explicit quotes and allusions between specific passages in Joel and passages from the Old and New Testaments.

==Liturgical usage==
Plange quasi virgo (&quot;Lament like a virgin&quot;), the third responsory for Holy Saturday, is loosely based on verses from the Book of Joel: the title comes from Joel 1:8.

<text>The Book of Hosea () is collected as one of the twelve minor prophets of the Nevi&#x27;im (&quot;Prophets&quot;) in the Tanakh, and as a book in its own right in the Christian Old Testament. According to the traditional order of most Hebrew Bibles, it is the first of the Twelve.

Set around the fall of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, the Book of Hosea denounces the worship of gods other than Yahweh (the God of Israel), metaphorically comparing Israel&#x27;s abandonment of Yahweh to a woman being unfaithful to her husband. According to the book&#x27;s narrative, the relationship between Hosea and his unfaithful wife Gomer is comparable to the relationship between Yahweh and his unfaithful people Israel: this text &quot;for the first time&quot; describes the latter relationship in terms of a marriage. The eventual reconciliation of Hosea and Gomer is treated as a hopeful metaphor for the eventual reconciliation between Yahweh and Israel.

Redaction-critical studies of Hosea since the 1980s have increasingly emphasized the theological and literary unity created by editors, though scholars differ significantly in their interpretations of the redaction process, stages, and the extent of the eighth-century prophetâs original contributions. Ehud Ben Zviâs interpretation of Hosea as a product of Persian period literati constructing didactic prophetic readings has spurred much debate.
Hosea is the source of the phrase &quot;&quot;, which has passed into common usage in English and other languages.

== Background and content ==

Hosea prophesied during a dark and melancholic era of Israel&#x27;s history, the period of the Northern Kingdom&#x27;s decline and fall in the 8th century BC. According to the book, the apostasy of the people was rampant, having turned away from God in order to serve both the calves of Jeroboam and Baal, a Canaanite god.

The Book of Hosea says that, during Hosea&#x27;s lifetime, the kings of the Northern Kingdom, their aristocratic supporters, and the priests had led the people away from the Law of God, as given in the Pentateuch. It says that they forsook the worship of God; they worshiped other gods, especially Baal, the Canaanite storm god, and Asherah, a Canaanite fertility goddess. Other sins followed, says the Book, including homicide, perjury, theft, and sexual sin. Hosea declares that unless they repent of these sins, God will allow their nation to be destroyed, and the people will be taken into captivity by Assyria, the greatest nation of the time.

The prophecy of Hosea centers on God&#x27;s unending love towards a sinful Israel. In this text, God&#x27;s agony is expressed over his betrayal by Israel. Stephen Cook asserts that the prophetic efforts of this book can be summed up in this passage &quot;I have been the Lord your God ever since the land of Egypt; you know no god but me, and besides me there is no savior&quot;. Hosea&#x27;s job was to speak these words during a time when they had been essentially forgotten.

== Summary ==
The Book of Hosea contains a number of prophecies and messages for both Judah and Northern Israel (Samaria) said (verses 1:1, 1:2) to come from God. These are delivered by the prophet Hosea. Their context is predominantly in the Northern Kingdom, but there are several references to Judah. The editors of the Jerusalem Bible comment that there has been a tendency among biblical scholars to treat all the references to Judah as later additions, but argued from the 1960s that &quot;more sober conclusions are being urged today&quot;. In their opinion, while some references may have been additions, such as Hosea 1:7, 2:1-3 and 14:10, others may indicate that Hosea continued to preach in the southern kingdom after the fall of the north.

===General outline===
* Chapters 1â2: Hosea&#x27;s marriage to Gomer is described biographically (&quot;The said to Hosea&quot;), which is a metaphor for the relationship between God and Israel.
* Chapter 3: Hosea&#x27;s marriage is described autobiographically (&quot;Then the said to me&quot;): this is possibly a marriage to different women.
* Chapters 4â14:9/14:10: Oracle judging Israel, Ephraim in particular, for not living up to the covenant.
No further breakdown of ideas is clear in 4â14:9/14:10. Following this, the prophecy is made that someday this will all be changed, and that God will have pity on Israel.
Chapter two describes a divorce. This divorce seems to be the end of the covenant between God and the Northern Kingdom. However, it is probable that this was again a symbolic act, in which Hosea divorced Gomer for infidelity, and used the occasion to preach the message of God&#x27;s rejection of the Northern Kingdom. He ends this prophecy with the declaration that God will one day renew the covenant, and will take Israel back in love.

In chapter three, at God&#x27;s command, Hosea seeks out Gomer once more. Either she has sold herself into slavery for debt, or she is with a lover who demands money in order to give her up, because Hosea has to buy her back. He takes her home, but refrains from sexual intimacy with her for many days, to symbolize the fact that Israel will be without a king for many years, but that God will take Israel back, even at a cost to himself.

Chapters 4â14 spell out the allegory at length. Chapters 1â3 speaks of Hosea&#x27;s family, and the issues with Gomer. Chapters 4â10 contain a series of oracles, or prophetic sermons, showing exactly why God is rejecting the Northern Kingdom (what the grounds are for the divorce). Chapter 11 is God&#x27;s lament over the necessity of giving up the Northern Kingdom, which is a large part of the people of Israel, whom God loves. God promises not to give them up entirely. Then, in Chapter 12, the prophet pleads for Israel&#x27;s repentance. Chapter 13 foretells the destruction of the kingdom at the hands of Assyria, because there has been no repentance. In Chapter 14, the prophet urges Israel to seek forgiveness, and promises its restoration, while urging the utmost fidelity to God.

The capital of the Northern Kingdom fell in 722 BC. All the members of the upper classes and many of the ordinary people were taken captive and carried off to live as prisoners of war.

===A summary of Hosea&#x27;s story===
First, Hosea was directed by God to marry a promiscuous woman of ill-repute, and he did so. Marriage here is symbolic of the covenantal relationship between God and Israel. However, Israel has been unfaithful to God by following other gods and breaking the commandments which are the terms of the covenant, hence Israel is symbolized by a harlot who violates the obligations of marriage to her husband.

Second, Hosea and his wife, Gomer, have a son. God commands that the son be named Jezreel. This name refers to a valley in which much blood had been shed in Israel&#x27;s history, especially by the kings of the Northern Kingdom. The naming of this son was to stand as a prophecy against the reigning house of the Northern Kingdom, that they would pay for that bloodshed. Jezreel&#x27;s name means &quot;God sows&quot;.

Third, the couple have a daughter. God commands that she be named Lo-ruhamah, meaning &quot;unloved&quot;, &quot;pity&quot; or &quot;pitied on&quot; to show Israel that, although God will still have pity on the Southern Kingdom, God will no longer have pity on the Northern Kingdom; its destruction is imminent. In the NIV translation, the omitting of the word &quot;him&quot; leads to speculation as to whether Lo-Ruhamah was the daughter of Hosea or one of Gomer&#x27;s lovers. James Mays, however, says that the failure to mention Hosea&#x27;s paternity is &quot;hardly an implication&quot; of Gomer&#x27;s adultery.

Fourth, a son is born to Gomer. It is questionable whether this child was Hosea&#x27;s, for God commands that his name be Lo-ammi, meaning &quot;not my people&quot;. The child bore this name of shame to show that the Northern Kingdom would also be shamed, for its people would no longer be known as God&#x27;s people. In other words, the Northern Kingdom had been rejected by God.

==Usage in the New Testament==
Matthew 2:13 cites Hosea&#x27;s prophecy in Hosea 11:1 that God would call His Son out of Egypt as foretelling the flight into Egypt and return to Israel of Joseph, Mary, and the infant Jesus.

In Luke 23:30, Jesus referenced Hosea 10:8 when he said &quot;Then they will begin to say to the mountains &#x27;Cover us&quot; and to the hills, &#x27;Fall on us&#x27;.&#x27;. The quote is also echoed in Revelation 6:16.

== Interpretation and context ==
In Hosea 2, the woman in the marriage metaphor could be Hosea&#x27;s wife Gomer, or could be referring to the nation of Israel, invoking the metaphor of Israel as God&#x27;s bride. The woman is not portrayed in a positive light. This is reflected throughout the beginning of Hosea 2: &quot;I will strip her naked and expose her as in the day she was born&quot;; &quot;Upon her children I will have no pity, because they are children of whoredom&quot;; &quot;For she said, I will go after my lovers...&quot;.

Biblical scholar Ehud Ben Zvi reminds readers of the socio-historical context in which Hosea was composed. In his article &quot;Observations on the marital metaphor of YHWH and Israel in its ancient Israelite context: general considerations and particular images in Hosea 1.2&quot;, Ben Zvi describes the role of the Gomer in the marriage metaphor as one of the &quot;central attributes of the ideological image of a human marriage that was shared by the male authorship and the primary and intended male readership as building blocks for their imagining of the relationship.&quot;

Tristanne J. Connolly makes a similar observation, stating that the husband-wife motif reflects marriage as it was understood at the time. Connolly also suggests that in context the marriage metaphor was necessary in that it truly exemplified the unequal interaction between God and the people of Israel. Biblical scholar Michael D. Coogan describes the importance of understanding the covenant in relation to interpreting Hosea. According to Coogan, Hosea falls within a unique genre called &quot;covenant lawsuit&quot;, where God accuses Israel of breaking their previously made agreement. God&#x27;s disappointment with Israel is therefore expressed through the broken marriage covenant made between husband and wife.

Brad E. Kelle refers to &quot;many scholars&quot; finding references to cultic sexual practices in the worship of Baal, in Hosea 2, to be evidence of an historical situation in which Israelites were either giving up Yahweh worship for Baal, or blending the two, Hosea&#x27;s references to sexual acts being metaphors for Israelite &#x27;apostasy&#x27;.

Hosea 13:1â3 describes how the Israelites are abandoning Yahweh for the worship of Baal, and accuses them of making or using molten images for &#x27;idol&#x27; worship. Chief among these was the image of the bull at the northern shrine of Bethel, which by the time of Hosea was being worshipped as an image of Baal.

==Theological contribution ==
Hosea is a prophet whom God uses to portray a message of repentance to God&#x27;s people. Through Hosea&#x27;s marriage to Gomer, God shows his great love for his great people, comparing himself to a husband whose wife has committed adultery, using this image as a metaphor for the covenant between God and Israel. God&#x27;s love was &quot;misunderstood&quot; by his people. Hosea influenced latter prophets such as Jeremiah. He is among the first writing prophets, and the final chapter of Hosea has a format similar to wisdom literature.

Like Amos, Hosea elevated the religion of Israel to the altitude of ethical monotheism, being the first to emphasize the moral side of God&#x27;s nature. Israel&#x27;s faithlessness, which resisted all warnings, compelled him to punish the people because of his own holiness. Hosea considers infidelity as the chief sin, of which Israel, the adulterous wife, has been guilty against her loving husband, God. Against this he sets the unquenchable love of God, who, in spite of this infidelity, does not cast Israel away forever, but will draw his people to himself again after the judgment.

<doc id="4450" wikidata="Q174753" url="?curid=4450" title="Book of Obadiah">
<text>The Book of Obadiah is a book of the Bible whose authorship is attributed to Obadiah. Obadiah is one of the Twelve Minor Prophets in the final section of Nevi&#x27;im, the second main division of the Hebrew Bible. The text consists of a single chapter, divided into 21 verses with 440 Hebrew words, making it the shortest book in the Tanakh (The Hebrew Bible), though there are three shorter New Testament epistles in Greek (Philemon with 335 words, 2 John with 245 words, and 3 John with 219 words). The Book of Obadiah is a prophecy concerning the divine judgment of Edom and the restoration of Israel.

The majority of scholars date the Book of Obadiah to shortly after the fall of Jerusalem in 587 BC. 
As part of the recent Persian turn in Minor Prophets scholarship, the Book of Obadiah is considered to have been shaped by the conflicts between Yehud and the Edomites in the fifth and fourth centuries BCE and to have evolved through a process of redaction.

== Content ==

The Book of Obadiah is based on a prophetic vision concerning the fall of Edom, a mountain-dwelling nation whose founding father was Esau. Obadiah describes an encounter with Yahweh, who addresses Edom&#x27;s arrogance and charges them for their &quot;violence against your brother Jacob&quot;.

Throughout most of the history of Judah, Edom was controlled absolutely from Jerusalem as a vassal state. Obadiah said that the high elevation of their dwelling place in the mountains of Seir had gone to their head, and they had puffed themselves up in pride. &quot;&#x27;Though you soar like the eagle and make your nest among the stars, from there I will bring you down,&#x27; declares the &quot;.

In the Siege of Jerusalem (597 BC), Nebuchadnezzar II sacked Jerusalem, carted away the King of Judah, and installed a puppet ruler. The Edomites helped the Babylonians loot the city. Obadiah, writing this prophecy around 590 BCE, suggests the Edomites should have remembered that blood was thicker than water. &quot;On the day you stood aloof while strangers carried off his wealth and foreigners entered his gates and cast lots for Jerusalem, you were like one of them... You should not march through the gates of my people in the day of their disaster, nor gloat over them in their calamity in the day of their disaster, nor seize their wealth in the day of their disaster.&quot;

Obadiah said in judgment that Yahweh would wipe out the house of Esau forever, and not even a remnant would remain. The Edomites&#x27; land would be possessed by the lands of the south and they would cease to exist as a people. The Day of the Lord was at hand for all nations, and one day, the children of Israel would return victorious from their exile and possess the land of Edom, the fields of Ephraim, the land of Gilead, the lowland of Philistia, and the fields of Samaria.

== Scholarly issues ==

===Dating Obadiah===
The date of composition is disputed and is difficult to determine due to the lack of personal information about Obadiah, his family, and his historical milieu: the date must therefore be determined based on the prophecy itself. Edom is to be destroyed due to its lack of defense for its brother nation, Israel, when it was under attack. There are two major historical contexts within which the Edomites could have committed such an act. These are during 853â841 BCE when Jerusalem was invaded by Philistines and Arabs during the reign of Jehoram of Judah (recorded in 2 Kings and 2 Chronicles in the Christian Old Testament) and 607â586 BCE when Jerusalem was attacked by Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon, which led to the Babylonian exile of Israel (recorded in Psalm 137). The earlier period would place Obadiah as a contemporary of the prophet Elijah.

The later date would place Obadiah as a contemporary of the prophet Jeremiah. A sixth-century date for Obadiah is a &quot;near consensus&quot; position among scholars. contains parallels to the Book of Jeremiah . The passage in the Book of Jeremiah dates from the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim (604 BCE), and therefore seems to refer to the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar II (586 BCE). It is more likely that Obadiah and the Book of Jeremiah together were drawing on a common source presently unknown to us rather than Jeremiah drawing on previous writings of Obadiah as his source. There is also much material found in which Jeremiah does not quote, and which, had he had it laid out before him, would have suited his purpose admirably.

===Sepharad===

The term &quot;Sepharad&quot; mentioned in the 20th verse of Obadiah comes from the Hebrew word for Spain.

<doc id="4451" wikidata="Q178819" url="?curid=4451" title="Book of Jonah">
<text>The Book of Jonah is one of the twelve minor prophets of the Nevi&#x27;im (&quot;Prophets&quot;) in the Hebrew Bible, and an individual book in the Christian Old Testament. The book tells of a Hebrew prophet named Jonah, son of Amittai, who is sent by God to prophesy the destruction of Nineveh, but attempts to escape his divine mission.

The story has a long interpretive history and has become well known through popular children&#x27;s stories. In Judaism, it is the Haftarah portion read during the afternoon of Yom Kippur to instill reflection on God&#x27;s willingness to forgive those who repent, and it remains a popular story among Christians. The story is also retold in the Quran.

Mainstream Bible scholars generally regard the story of the Book of Jonah as fictional, and often at least partially satirical. Most scholars consider the Book of Jonah to have been composed long after the events it describes due to its use of words and motifs exclusive to postexilic Aramaic sources.

==Date==
The prophet Jonah (Hebrew: ××Ö¹× Ö¸×, YonÄ) is mentioned in 2 Kings 14:25, which places Jonah&#x27;s life during the reign of Jeroboam II, King of Israel, (786â746Â BC), but the book of Jonah itself does not name a king or give any other details that would give the story a firm date. Most scholars consider the Book of Jonah to have been composed long after the events it describes due to its use of words and motifs exclusive to postexilic Aramaic sources. A later date is sometimes proposed, with Katherine Dell arguing for the Hellenistic period (332â167 BC).

Evangelical Assyriologist Donald Wiseman takes issue with the idea that the story is late (or a parable). Among other arguments he mentions that the &quot;Legends of Agade&quot; (see Sargon of Akkad and Rabisu) date to the time of the Old Babylonian Empire, though later versions &quot;usually taken as a late composition, propagandistic fairy tale or historical romance can now, on the basis of new discoveries of earlier sources, be shown to be based on a serious and reliable historical record&quot;.

== Narrative ==
Unlike the other Minor Prophets, the book of Jonah is almost entirely narrative with the exception of the psalm in the second chapter. The actual prophetic word against Nineveh is given only in passing through the narrative. The story of Jonah has a setting, characters, a plot, and themes; it also relies heavily on such literary devices as irony.

==Chapter and verse divisions==
The original text was written in Hebrew language. Chapters 1 and 2 are divided differently in the Hebrew and English versions: verse 2:1 in the Hebrew version is equivalent to Jonah 1:17 in the English version.
==Outline==
An outline of the book of Jonah:
# Jonah flees his mission (chapters 1â2)
## Jonah&#x27;s disobedience, and its consequences (1:1â17)
## Jonah&#x27;s deliverance and thanksgiving (2:2â9)
# Jonah fulfills his mission (chapters 3â4)
## Jonah&#x27;s obedience and Nineveh&#x27;s repentance (3:1â10)
## Jonah&#x27;s displeasure at the Lord&#x27;s salvation.

===Summary===
Jonah is the central character in the Book of Jonah, in which God (&quot;the &quot;) commands him to go to the city of Nineveh to prophesy against it for their great wickedness against God. However, Jonah instead attempts to run from God by going to Jaffa and sailing to Tarshish. A huge storm arises and the sailors, realizing that it is no ordinary storm, cast lots and discover that Jonah is to blame. Jonah admits this and states that if he is thrown overboard, the storm will cease. The sailors refuse to do this and continue rowing, but all their efforts fail and they are eventually forced to throw Jonah overboard. As a result, the storm calms and the sailors then offer sacrifices to God. Jonah is miraculously saved by being swallowed by a &quot;great fish&quot;, in whose belly he spends three days and three nights.

While inside the great fish, Jonah prays to God in thanksgiving and commits to paying what he has vowed. Jonah&#x27;s prayer has been compared with some of the Psalms, and with the Song of Hannah in 1 Samuel 2:1-10.

God then commands the fish to vomit Jonah out.

In chapter 3, God once again commands Jonah to travel to Nineveh and to prophesy to its inhabitants. This time he obeys God&#x27;s command, and goes into the city, crying, &quot;In forty days Nineveh shall be overthrown.&quot; After Jonah has walked across Nineveh, the people of Nineveh begin to believe his word and proclaim a fast. The king of Nineveh then puts on sackcloth and sits in ashes, making a proclamation which decrees fasting, the wearing of sackcloth, prayer, and repentance. God sees their repentant hearts and spares the city at that time. The entire city is humbled and broken, with the people (and even the animals) in sackcloth and ashes.

In chapter 4, displeased by the Ninevites&#x27; repentance, Jonah refers to his earlier flight to Tarshish while asserting that, since God is merciful, it was inevitable that God would turn from the threatened calamities. He then leaves the city on its eastern side, and makes himself a shelter, waiting to see whether or not the city will be destroyed. God causes a plant, in Hebrew a , also called a gourd in the King James Version, to grow over Jonah&#x27;s shelter to give him some shade from the sun. Later, God causes a worm to bite the plant&#x27;s root and it withers. Jonah, now being exposed to the full force of the sun, becomes faint and pleads for God to kill him. In response, God offers Jonah one final rebuke:

The book ends abruptly at this point.

== Interpretive history ==
===Early Jewish interpretation===
Fragments of the book were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, most of which follow the Masoretic Text closely and with Mur XII reproducing a large portion of the text. As for the non-canonical writings, the majority of references to biblical texts were made as appeals to authority. The Book of Jonah appears to have served less purpose in the Qumran community than other texts, as the writings make no references to it.

===Late Jewish interpretation===
The 18th century Lithuanian master scholar and kabbalist, Elijah of Vilna, known as the Vilna Gaon, authored a commentary on the biblical Book of Jonah as an allegory of reincarnation.

===Early Christian interpretation===

====New Testament====

The earliest Christian interpretations of Jonah are found in the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke. Both Matthew and Luke record a tradition of Jesus&#x27; interpretation of the Book of Jonah (notably, Matthew includes two very similar traditions in chapters 12 and 16).

As with most Old Testament interpretations found in the New Testament, the interpretation ascribed to Jesus is primarily typological. Jonah becomes a &quot;type&quot; for Jesus. Jonah spent three days in the belly of the fish; Jesus will spend three days in the tomb. Here, Jesus plays on the imagery of Sheol found in Jonah&#x27;s prayer. While Jonah metaphorically declared, &quot;Out of the belly of Sheol I cried,&quot; Jesus will literally be in the belly of Sheol. Finally, Jesus compares his generation to the people of Nineveh. Jesus fulfills his role as a type of Jonah, however his generation fails to fulfill its role as a type of Nineveh. Nineveh repented, but Jesus&#x27; generation, which has seen and heard one even greater than Jonah, fails to repent. Through his typological interpretation of the Book of Jonah, Jesus has weighed his generation and found it wanting.

====Augustine of Hippo====
The debate over the credibility of the miracle of Jonah is not simply a modern one. The credibility of a human being surviving in the belly of a great fish has long been questioned. In , Augustine of Hippo wrote to Deogratias concerning the challenge of some to the miracle recorded in the Book of Jonah. He writes:

Augustine responds that if one is to question one miracle, then one should question all miracles as well (section 31). Nevertheless, despite his apologetic, Augustine views the story of Jonah as a figure for Christ. For example, he writes: &quot;As, therefore, Jonah passed from the ship to the belly of the whale, so Christ passed from the cross to the sepulchre, or into the abyss of death. And as Jonah suffered this for the sake of those who were endangered by the storm, so Christ suffered for the sake of those who are tossed on the waves of this world.&quot; Augustine credits his allegorical interpretation to the interpretation of Christ himself (Matthew 12:39â40), and he allows for other interpretations as long as they are in line with Christ&#x27;s.

===Medieval commentary tradition===

The &quot;Ordinary Gloss&quot;, or , was the most important Christian commentary on the Bible in the later Middle Ages. Ryan McDermott comments that &quot;The Gloss on Jonah relies almost exclusively on Jerome&#x27;s commentary on Jonah (), so its Latin often has a tone of urbane classicism. But the Gloss also chops up, compresses, and rearranges Jerome with a carnivalesque glee and scholastic directness that renders the Latin authentically medieval.&quot; &quot;The Ordinary Gloss on Jonah&quot; has been translated into English and printed in a format that emulates the first printing of the Gloss.

The relationship between Jonah and his fellow Jews is ambivalent, and complicated by the Gloss&#x27;s tendency to read Jonah as an allegorical prefiguration of Jesus Christ. While some glosses in isolation seem crudely supersessionist (&quot;The foreskin believes while the circumcision remains unfaithful&quot;), the prevailing allegorical tendency is to attribute Jonah&#x27;s recalcitrance to his abiding love for his own people and his insistence that God&#x27;s promises to Israel not be overridden by a lenient policy toward the Ninevites. For the glossator, Jonah&#x27;s pro-Israel motivations correspond to Christ&#x27;s demurral in the Garden of Gethsemane (&quot;My Father, if it be possible, let this chalice pass from me&quot;) and the Gospel of Matthew&#x27;s and Paul&#x27;s insistence that &quot;salvation is from the Jews&quot; (John 4:22). While in the Gloss the plot of Jonah prefigures how God will extend salvation to the nations, it also makes abundantly clearâas some medieval commentaries on the Gospel of John do notâthat Jonah and Jesus are Jews, and that they make decisions of salvation-historical consequence as Jews.

===Modern===
In Jungian analysis, the belly of the whale can be seen as a symbolic death and rebirth, which is also an important stage in comparative mythologist Joseph Campbell&#x27;s &quot;hero&#x27;s journey&quot;.

NCSY Director of Education David Bashevkin sees Jonah as a thoughtful prophet who comes to religion out of a search for theological truth and is constantly disappointed by those who come to religion to provide mere comfort in the face of adversity inherent to the human condition. &quot;If religion is only a blanket to provide warmth from the cold, harsh realities of life,&quot; Bashevkin imagines Jonah asking, &quot;did concerns of theological truth and creed even matter?&quot; The lesson taught by the episode of the tree at the end of the book is that comfort is a deep human need that religion provides, but that this need not obscure the role of God.

== Jonah and the &quot;big fish&quot; ==
The Hebrew text of Jonah reads (, ), literally meaning &quot;great fish&quot;. The Septuagint translated this into Greek as (), &quot;huge whale/sea monster&quot;; and in Greek mythology the term was closely associated with sea monsters. Saint Jerome later translated the Greek phrase as in his Latin Vulgate, and as in Matthew. At some point, became synonymous with whale (cf. cetyl alcohol, which is alcohol derived from whales). In his 1534 translation, William Tyndale translated the phrase in Jonah 2:1 as &quot;greate fyshe&quot;, and he translated the word (Greek) or (Latin) in Matthew as &quot;whale&quot;. Tyndale&#x27;s translation was later followed by the translators of the King James Version of 1611 and has enjoyed general acceptance in English translations.

In the book of Jonah chapter 1 verse 17, the Hebrew bible refers to the fish as , &quot;great fish&quot;, in the masculine. However, in chapter 2 verse 1, the word which refers to fish is written as , meaning female fish. The verses therefore read: &quot;And the lord provided a great fish (, , masculine) for Jonah, and it swallowed him, and Jonah sat in the belly of the fish (still male) for three days and nights; then, from the belly of the (, , female) fish, Jonah began to pray.&quot;

== Jonah and the gourd vine ==
The Book of Jonah closes abruptly, with an epistolary warning based on the emblematic trope of a fast-growing vine present in Persian narratives, and popularized in fables such as &quot;The Gourd and the Palm-tree&quot; during the Renaissance, for example by Andrea Alciato.

St. Jerome differed from St. Augustine in his Latin translation of the plant known in Hebrew as (), using (from the Greek, meaning &quot;ivy&quot;) over the more common Latin , &quot;gourd,&quot; from which the English word &quot;gourd&quot; (Old French , ) is derived. The Renaissance humanist artist Albrecht DÃ¼rer memorialized Jerome&#x27;s decision to use an analogical type of Christ&#x27;s &quot;I am the Vine, you are the branches&quot; in his woodcut &quot;Saint Jerome in His Study&quot;.

==Surviving ancient manuscripts==

Some early manuscripts containing the text of this book in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text tradition, which includes the Codex Cairensis (895), the Petersburg Codex of the Prophets (916), and Codex Leningradensis (1008).

Fragments of this book in Hebrew were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls (cumulatively covering the whole book), including 4Q82 (4QXIIg; 25 BCE) with extant verses 1:1â9, 2:3â11, 3:1, 3:3, and 4:5â11; and Wadi Murabba&#x27;at Minor Prophets (Mur88; MurXIIProph; 75â100 CE) with extant verses 1:14â16, 2:1â7; 3:2â5, 3:7â10; 4:1â2, and 4:5.

The oldest known complete version of the book is the Crosby-SchÃ¸yen Codex, part of the Bodmer Papyri, which dates to the 3rd century, and is written in Coptic.

There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BC. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; formula_1B; 4th century), Codex Sinaiticus (S; BHK: formula_1S; 4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (A; formula_1A; 5th century) and Codex Marchalianus (Q; formula_1Q; 6th century).

Fragments containing parts of this book in Greek were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, including 4Q76 (4QXIIa; 150â125 BCE) with extant verses 1:1â5, 1:7â10, 1:15â17 (1:17 = 2:1 in Hebrew Bible), 2:6 (verses 2:1,7 in Masoretic Text), and 3:2; 4Q81 (4QXIIf; 175â50 BCE) with extant verses 1:6â8, 1:10â16; 4Q82 (4QXIIg; 25 BCE) with extant verses 1:1â9, 2:2â10 (verses 2:3â11 in Masoretic Text), 3:1â3, and 4:5â11; and Wadi Murabba&#x27;at Minor Prophets (Mur88; MurXIIProph; 75â100 CE) with extant verses 1:1â17 (1:1â16, 2:1 in Hebrew Bible), 2:1â10 (verses 2:1â11 in Masoretic Text), 3:1â10, and 4:1â11., and Naá¸¥al á¸¤ever (8á¸¤evXIIgr; 1st century CE) with extant verses 2:1â6 (verses 2:1â7 in Masoretic Text), 3:2â5, 3:7â10, 4:1â2, and 4:5.

<doc id="4452" wikidata="Q178076" url="?curid=4452" title="Book of Micah">
<text>The Book of Micah is the sixth of the twelve minor prophets in the Hebrew Bible. Ostensibly, it records the sayings of Micah, whose name is &quot;Mikayahu&quot; (), meaning &quot;Who is like Yahweh?&quot;, an 8th-century BCE prophet from the village of Moresheth in Judah (Hebrew name from the opening verse: ×××× ×××¨×©×ª×).

The book has three major divisions, chapters 1â2, 3â5 and 6â7, each introduced by the word &quot;Hear&quot;, with a pattern of alternating announcements of doom and expressions of hope within each division. Micah reproaches unjust leaders, defends the rights of the poor against the rich and powerful; while looking forward to a world at peace centered on Zion under the leadership of a new Davidic monarch.

While the book is relatively short, it includes lament (1:8â16; 7:8â10), theophany (1.3â4), a hymnic prayer of petition and confidence (7:14â20), and the &quot;covenant lawsuit&quot; (6:1â8), a distinct genre in which Yahweh (God) sues Israel for breach of contract of the Mosaic covenant.

The formation of the Book of Micah is debated, with a consensus that its final stage occurred during the Persian period or Hellenistic period, but uncertainty remains about whether it was formed at the time or merely finalized.

==Setting==
The opening verse identifies the prophet as &quot;Micah of Moresheth&quot; (a town in southern Judah), and states that he lived during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, roughly 750â700Â BCE.

This corresponds to the period when, after a long period of peace, Israel, Judah, and the other nations of the region came under increasing pressure from the aggressive and rapidly expanding Neo-Assyrian empire. Between 734 and 727 Tiglath-Pileser III of Assyria conducted almost annual campaigns in the Levant, reducing the Kingdom of Israel, the Kingdom of Judah and the Philistine cities to vassalage, receiving tribute from Ammon, Moab and Edom, and absorbing Damascus (the Kingdom of Aram) into the Empire. On Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s death Israel rebelled, resulting in an Assyrian counter-attack and the destruction of the capital, Samaria, in 721 after a three-year siege. Micah 1:2â7 draws on this event: Samaria, says the prophet, has been destroyed by God because of its crimes of idolatry, oppression of the poor, and misuse of power. The Assyrian attacks on Israel (the northern kingdom) led to an influx of refugees into Judah, which would have increased social stresses, while at the same time the authorities in Jerusalem had to invest huge amounts in tribute and defense.

When the Assyrians attacked Judah in 701 they did so via the Philistine coast and the Shephelah, the border region which included Micah&#x27;s village of Moresheth, as well as Lachish, Judah&#x27;s second largest city. This in turn forms the background to verses 1:8â16, in which Micah warns the towns of the coming disaster (Lachish is singled out for special mention, accused of the corrupt practices of both Samaria and Jerusalem). In verses 2:1â5 he denounces the appropriation of land and houses, which might simply be the greed of the wealthy and powerful, or possibly the result of the militarizing of the area in preparation for the Assyrian attack.

==Composition==
The formation of the Book of Micah is a topic of scholarly debate. The 2021 Oxford Handbook of the Minor Prophets summarizes:

âThere is a consensus that the book has a long history of formation with the Persian (or even Hellenistic) period as its last stage. However, it is contested whether it was formed in these days or only finalized after a longer history of tradition.â

Some, but not all, scholars accept that only chapters 1â3 contain material from the late 8th-century BCE prophet Micah. According to scholars, the latest material comes from the post-Exilic period after the Temple was rebuilt in 515Â BCE, so that the early 5th century BCE seems to be the period when the book was completed. The first stage was the collection and arrangement of some spoken sayings of the historical Micah (the material in chapters 1â3), in which the prophet attacks those who build estates through oppression and depicts the Assyrian invasion of Judah as Yahweh&#x27;s punishment on the kingdom&#x27;s corrupt rulers, including a prophecy that the Temple will be destroyed.

The prophecy was not fulfilled in Micah&#x27;s time, but a hundred years later when Judah was facing a similar crisis with the Neo-Babylonian Empire, Micah&#x27;s prophecies were reworked and expanded to reflect the new situation. Still later, after Jerusalem fell to the Neo-Babylonian Empire, the book was revised and expanded further to reflect the circumstances of the late exilic and post-exilic community.

== Surviving early manuscripts ==
The oldest surviving manuscripts were made hundreds of years after the period or periods of authorship. The earliest surviving Masoretic Text versions include the Codex Cairensis (895), the Petersburg Codex of the Prophets (916), and Codex Leningradensis (1008). Since 1947, the current text of the Aleppo Codex is missing Micah 1:1 to 5:1.

Fragments containing parts of this book in the original Biblical Hebrew were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, including 4Q82 (25 BCE); and Wadi Murabba&#x27;at Minor Prophets (75â100 CE).

There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BCE. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (5th century) and Codex Marchalianus (6th century). The Book of Micah is missing in the extant Codex Sinaiticus. Some fragments containing parts of this book in Greek were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, that is, Naá¸¥al á¸¤ever 8á¸¤ev1 (late 1st century BCE).

== Content ==
===Structure===
At the broadest level, Micah can be divided into three roughly equal parts:
* Judgment against the nations and their leaders
* Restoration of Zion (chapters 4â5, which belong together despite their possibly unclear connection, probably exilic and post-exilic);
* God&#x27;s lawsuit against Israel and expression of hope (chapters 6â7, also probably exilic and post-exilic).

James Limburg sees the word &quot;Hear&quot; in Micah 1:2, 3:1 and 6:1 as the marker for three separate sections, noting that Amos 3:1, 4:1, 5:1 and 8:4 mark similar divisions within the Book of Amos, another of the minor prophets.

Within this broad three-part structure are a series of alternating oracles of judgment and promises of restoration:
* 1.1 Superscription
* 1.2â2.11 Oracles of judgment
* 2.12â13 Oracles of restoration
* 3.1â12 Oracles of judgment
* 4.1â5.15 Oracles of restoration
* 6.1â7.6 Oracles of judgment
* 7.7â20 Oracles of restoration

===Verse numbering===
There is a difference in verse numbering between English Bibles and Hebrew texts, with Micah 4:14 in Hebrew texts being Micah 5:1 in English Bibles, and the Hebrew 5:1 etc. being numbered 5:2 etc. in English Bibles. This article generally follows the common numbering in Christian English Bible versions.

===Subsections===
* The Heading: As is typical of prophetic books, an anonymous editor or scribe has supplied the name of the prophet, an indication of his time of activity, and an identification of his speech as the &quot;word of Yahweh&quot;, a generic term carrying a claim to prophetic legitimacy and authority. Samaria and Jerusalem are given prominence as the foci of the prophet&#x27;s attention. Unlike prophets such as Isaiah and Hosea, no record of his father&#x27;s name has been retained.
* Judgment against Samaria (1:2â7): Drawing upon ancient traditions for depicting a theophany, the prophet depicts the coming of Yahweh to punish the city, whose sins are idolatry and the abuse of the poor.
* Warnings to the cities of Judah (1:8â16): Samaria has fallen, Judah is next. Micah describes the destruction of the lesser towns of Judah (referring to the invasion of Judah by Sennacherib, 701Â BCE). For these passages of doom on the various cities, paronomasia is used. Paronomasia is a literary device which &#x27;plays&#x27; on the sound of each word for literary effect. For example, the inhabitants of Beth-le-aphrah (&quot;house of dust&quot;) are told to &quot;roll yourselves in the dust&quot; (1:14). Though most of the paronomasia is lost in translation, it is the equivalent of &#x27;Ashdod shall be but ashes,&#x27; where the fate of the city matches its name.
* Misuse of power denounced (2:1â5): Denounces those who appropriate the land and houses of others. The context may be simply the amassing wealth for its own sake, or could be connected with the militarisation of the region for the expected Assyrian attack.
* Threats against the prophet (2:6â11): The prophet is warned not to prophesy. He answers that the rulers are harming God&#x27;s people, and want to listen only to those who advocate the virtues of wine.
* A later promise (2:12â13): These verses assume that judgment has already fallen and Israel is already scattered abroad.
* Judgment on wicked Zion (3:1â4): Israel&#x27;s rulers are accused of gaining more wealth at the expense of the poor, by any means. The metaphor of flesh being torn from the people illustrates the length to which the ruling classes and socialites would go to further increase their wealth. Prophets are corrupt, seeking personal gain. Jerusalem&#x27;s rulers believe that God will always be with them, but God will be with his people, and Jerusalem will be destroyed.
*Prophets for Profit (3:5-8): those condemned by Micah are explicitly called &quot;prophets&quot;, while he appears to distance himself from personally being called a prophet.
*A concluding judgment (3:9-12) drawing together chapters 2â3.
* Zion&#x27;s future hope (4:1â5): This is a later passage, almost identical to Isaiah 2:2â4. In the &quot;latter days&quot;, &quot;last days&quot;, or &quot;the days to come&quot;, Zion (meaning the Temple) will be rebuilt, but by God, and based not on violence and corruption but on the desire to learn God&#x27;s laws, beat swords to ploughshares and live in peace.

* Further promises to Zion (4:6â7): This is another later passage, promising Zion that she will once more enjoy her former independence and power.
* Deliverance from distress in Babylon (4:9â5:1, 4:9-14 in Hebrew Bible numbering) The similarity with Isaiah 41:15â16 and the references to Babylon suggest a later period for this material, although it is unclear whether a period during or after the siege of 586 is meant. Despite their trials, God will not desert his people.
* The promised ruler from Bethlehem (5:1[2]â14): This passage is usually dated to the exile. Although Micah 4:9 has asked &quot;is there no king&quot; in Zion, this chapter predicts that the coming Messiah will emerge from Bethlehem, the traditional home of the Davidic monarchy, to restore Israel. Assyria will invade (some translations prefer &quot;&quot;if&quot; the Assyrians invade&quot;), but she will be stricken, and Israel&#x27;s punishment will lead to the punishment of the nations. Williamson treats Micah 4:8-5:6 as one unit, with &quot;a clear and balanced structure&quot;.

* A Covenant lawsuit (6:1â5): Yahweh accuses Israel (the people of Judah) of breaking the covenant through their lack of justice and honesty, after the pattern of the kings of Israel (northern kingdom).
* Torah Liturgy (6:6â8): Micah speaks on behalf of the community asking what they should do in order to get back on God&#x27;s good side. Micah then responds by saying that God requires only &quot;to do justice, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God&quot;, thus declaring that the burnt offering of both animals and humans (which may have been practiced in Judah under Kings Ahaz and Manasseh) is not necessary for God.
* The City as a Cheat (6:9â16): The city is reprimanded for its dishonest trade practices.
* Lament (7:1â7): The first passage in the book in the first person: whether it comes from Micah himself is disputed. Honesty and decency have vanished, families are filled with strife. The Jerusalem Bible suggests that verse 7, &quot;For my part, I look to Yahweh ...&quot; may have been the conclusion of the original book, before additional poems on Israel&#x27;s restoration were added.
* A song of fallen Jerusalem (7:8â10): The first person voice continues, but now it is the city who speaks. She recognises that her destruction is deserved punishment from God. The recognition gives grounds for hope that God is still with her.
* A prophecy of restoration (7:11â13): Fallen Jerusalem is promised that she will be rebuilt and that her power will be greater than ever (a contrast with the vision of peace in 4:1â5).
* A prayer for future prosperity (7:14â17): The mood switches from a request for power to grateful astonishment at God&#x27;s mercy. Hermann Gunkel and Bo Reicke identify the last chapter as a ritual text possibly connected to a festival such as the Israelite New Year.
*A hymn of praise for the incomparable God (7:18-20): the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine in the United States notes that these final verses &quot;contain a hymn of praise for the incomparable God, who pardons sin and delights in mercy&quot;.

== Themes ==
Micah addresses the future of Judah/Israel after the Babylonian exile. Like Isaiah, the book has a vision of the punishment of Israel and creation of a &quot;remnant&quot;, followed by world peace centered on Zion under the leadership of a new Davidic monarch; the people should do justice, turn to Yahweh, and await the end of their punishment. However, whereas Isaiah sees Jacob/Israel joining &quot;the nations&quot; under Yahweh&#x27;s rule, Micah looks forward to Israel ruling over the nations. Insofar as Micah appears to draw on and rework parts of Isaiah, it seems designed at least partly to provide a counterpoint to that book.

==Allusions in the New Testament==
There are several allusions to the Book of Micah in the New Testament:
*Matthew&#x27;s Gospel quotes from the Book of Micah in relation to Jesus being born in Bethlehem:


*Jesus&#x27; words in Matthew 10:36 reflect Micah&#x27;s warning that families will be divided:


:Although the wording is different, Jerome comments that &quot;we should always take note when a passage is cited out of the Old Testament, whether the sense only, or the very words are given&quot;.

*John&#x27;s Gospel has a possible allusion to the identification of the mysterious &quot;him&quot; that God causes to see marvels or marvelous things:

<text>The Book of Nahum is the seventh book of the 12 minor prophets of the Hebrew Bible. It is attributed to the prophet Nahum. The historical setting of Nahum as a prophet was 663 BCE to 612 BCE, while the historical setting that produced the book of Nahum is debated, with proposed timeframes ranging from shortly after the fall of Thebes in 663 BCE to the Maccabean period around 175-165 BCE. Its principal theme is the destruction of the Assyrian city of Nineveh.

== Background ==
Josephus places Nahum during the reign of Jotham, while others place him in the beginning of the reign of Ahaz, Judah&#x27;s next king, or even the latter half of the reign of Hezekiah, Ahaz&#x27;s son; all three accounts date the book to the 8th centuryÂ BC. The book would then have been written in Jerusalem, where Nahum would have witnessed the invasion of Sennacherib and his retreat.

Some scholars hold that &quot;the book of the vision&quot; was written at the time of the fall of Nineveh, at the hands of the Medes and Babylonians in 612 BC. possibly around 615 BC, before the downfall of Assyria. The oracles must be dated after the Assyrian destruction of Thebes, Egypt in 663Â BC, as this event is mentioned in Nahum 3:8.

=== Author ===

Little is known about Nahum&#x27;s personal history. His name means &quot;comfort&quot;, and he came from the town of &quot;Elkosh&quot; or &quot;Alqosh&quot; (Nahum 1:1), which scholars have attempted to identify with several cities, including the modern `Alqush of Assyria and Capernaum of northern Galilee. He was a very nationalistic Hebrew, and lived among the Elkoshites in peace.

=== Historical context ===

The subject of Nahum&#x27;s prophecy is the approaching complete and final destruction of Nineveh, which was the capital of the great and flourishing Assyrian empire at that time. Ashurbanipal was at the height of his glory. Nineveh was a city of vast extent, and was then the center of the civilization and commerce of the world, according to Nahum a &quot;bloody city all full of lies and robbery&quot;, a reference to the Neo-Assyrian Empire&#x27;s military campaigns and demand of tribute and plunder from conquered cities.

Jonah had already uttered his message of warning, and Nahum was followed by Zephaniah, who also predicted the destruction of the city.

Nineveh was destroyed apparently by fire around 625 BC, and the Assyrian empire came to an end, an event which changed the face of Asia. Archaeological digs have uncovered the splendor of Nineveh in its zenith under Sennacherib (705â681 BC), Esarhaddon (681â669 BC), and Ashurbanipal (669â633 BC). Massive walls were eight miles in circumference. It had a water aqueduct, palaces and a library with 20,000 clay tablets, including accounts of a creation in Enuma Elish and a flood in the Epic of Gilgamesh.

The Babylonian chronicle of the fall of Nineveh tells the story of the end of Nineveh. Nabopolassar of Babylon joined forces with Cyaxares, king of the Medes, and laid siege for three months.

Assyria lasted a few more years after the loss of its fortress, but attempts by Egyptian Pharaoh Necho II to rally the Assyrians failed due to opposition from king Josiah of Judah, and it seemed to be all over by 609 BC.

== Overview ==

Beyond its superscription, Nahum 1:1, the Book of Nahum consists of two parts: a prelude in chapter one, followed by chapters two and three, which describe the fall of Nineveh, which later took place in 612Â BC. Davidson notes that there are two parts to the superscription:
*&quot;The burden of Nineveh&quot;, or &quot;an oracle against Nineveh&quot;, probably an editorial addition, and 
*&quot;The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite&quot;, which &quot;may ... have come from the hand of the prophet himself&quot;.

Nineveh is compared to Thebes, the Egyptian city that Assyria itself had destroyed in 663Â BC. Nahum describes the siege and frenzied activity of Nineveh&#x27;s troops as they try in vain to halt the invaders. Poetically, he becomes a participant in the battle, and with subtle irony, barks battle commands to the defenders. Nahum uses numerous similes and metaphor that Nineveh will become weak &quot;like the lion hiding in its den&quot;. It concludes with a taunt song and funeral dirge of the impending destruction of Nineveh and the &quot;sleep&quot; or death of the Assyrian people and demise of the once great Assyrian conqueror-rulers.

== Surviving early manuscripts ==
The original text was written in Biblical Hebrew.

Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are the Masoretic Text, which includes the Codex Cairensis (895), Aleppo Codex (10th century), and Codex Leningradensis (1008).

Fragments of this book were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls including 4QpNah, known as the &quot;Nahum Commentary&quot; (1st century BC); 4Q82 (4QXIIg; 1st century BC). and Wadi Murabba&#x27;at MurXII (1st century AD).

There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BC, with extant manuscripts including Codex Vaticanus (B; formula_1B; 4th century), Codex Sinaiticus (S; BHK: formula_1S; 4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (A; formula_1A; 5th century) and Codex Marchalianus (Q; formula_1Q; 6th century). Some fragments containing parts of this chapter (a revision of the Septuagint) were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, i.e., Naá¸¥al á¸¤ever (8á¸¤evXIIgr; 1st century AD).

== Themes ==

=== The fall of Nineveh ===

Nahum&#x27;s prophecy carries a particular warning to the Ninevites of coming events, although he is partly in favor of the destruction. One might even say that the book of Nahum is &quot;a celebration of the fall of Assyria&quot;. And this is not just a warning or speaking positively of the destruction of Nineveh, it is also a positive encouragement and &quot;message of comfort for Israel, Judah, and others who had experienced the &quot;endless cruelty&quot; of the Assyrians.&quot;

The prophet Jonah shows us where God shows concern for the people of Nineveh, while Nahum&#x27;s writing testifies to his belief in the righteousness/justice of God and how God dealt with those Assyrians in punishment according to &quot;their cruelty&quot;. The Assyrians had been used as God&#x27;s &quot;rod of [â¦] anger, and the staff in their hand [as] indignation.&quot;

=== The nature of God ===
From its opening, Nahum affirms God to be slow to anger, but that God will by no means ignore the guilty; God will bring his vengeance and wrath to pass. God is presented as a God who will punish evil, but will protect those who trust in Him. The opening passage states: &quot;God is jealous, and the L revengeth; the L revengeth, and is furious; the L will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his enemies. The L is slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at all acquit the wicked&quot;.

&quot;The L is slow to anger and Quick to love; the L will not leave the guilty unpunished.&quot;

&quot;The L is good, a refuge in times of trouble. He cares for those who trust in him.&quot;

== Importance ==
God&#x27;s judgement on Nineveh is &quot;all because of the wanton lust of a harlot, alluring, the mistress of sorceries, who enslaved nations by her prostitution and peoples by her witchcraft.&quot; Infidelity, according to the prophets, related to spiritual unfaithfulness. For example: &quot;the land is guilty of the vilest adultery in departing from the L.&quot; John of Patmos used a similar analogy in Revelation chapter 17.

The prophecy of Nahum was referenced in the deuterocanonical Book of Tobit. In Tobit 14:4 (NRSV) a dying Tobit says to his son Tobias and Tobias&#x27; sons:

[My son] hurry off to Media, for I believe the word of God that Nahum spoke about Nineveh, that all these things will take place and overtake Assyria and Nineveh. Indeed, everything that was spoken by the prophets of Israel, whom God sent, will occur. 
However, some versions, such as the King James Version, refer to the prophet Jonah instead.

<doc id="4454" wikidata="Q178338" url="?curid=4454" title="Book of Haggai">
<text>The Book of Haggai (; ) is a book of the Hebrew Bible or Tanakh, and is the third-to-last of the Twelve Minor Prophets. It is a short book, consisting of only two chapters. The historical setting dates around 520Â BC, before the Temple had been rebuilt. The original text was written in Biblical Hebrew.

== Authorship ==
The Book of Haggai is named after the prophet Haggai whose prophecies are recorded in the book. The authorship of the book is uncertain. Some presume that Haggai wrote the book himself but he is repeatedly referred to in the third person which makes it unlikely that he wrote the text: it is more probable that the book was written by a disciple of Haggai who sought to preserve the content of Haggai&#x27;s spoken prophecies.

There is no biographical information given about the prophet in the Book of Haggai. Haggai&#x27;s name is derived from the Hebrew verbal root &quot;hgg&quot;, which means &quot;to make a pilgrimage&quot;. W. Sibley Towner suggests that Haggai&#x27;s name might come &quot;from his single-minded effort to bring about the reconstruction of that destination of ancient Judean pilgrims, the Temple in Jerusalem&quot;.

== Date ==
The &quot;Book of Haggai&quot; records events in 520Â BC, some 18 years after Cyrus had conquered Babylon and issued a decree in 538Â BC, allowing the captive Judahites to return to Judea. Cyrus saw the restoration of the temple as necessary for the restoration of religious practices and a sense of peoplehood, after the long exile. The precise date of the written text is uncertain but most likely dates to within a generation of Haggai himself. A traditional consensus dates the completion of the text to c. 515 BC. Other scholars consider the book to be completed around 417 BC, arguing that it did not refer to Darius the Great (Darius I), but to Darius II (424-405 BC).

== Early surviving manuscripts ==
Some early manuscripts containing the text of this book in Biblical Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text, which includes the Codex Cairensis (895), the Petersburg Codex of the Prophets (916), and Codex Leningradensis (1008). Fragments of the Hebrew text of this book were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, including 4Q77 (4QXIIb; 150â125 BCE) 4Q80 (4QXIIe; 75â50 BCE); and Wadi Murabba&#x27;at Minor Prophets (Mur88; MurXIIProph; 75-100 CE).

There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BCE. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; formula_1B; 4th century), Codex Sinaiticus (S; BHK: formula_1S; 4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (A; formula_1A; 5th century) and Codex Marchalianus (Q; formula_1Q; 6th century).

== Synopsis ==
Haggai&#x27;s message is filled with an urgency for the people to proceed with the rebuilding of the second Jerusalem temple. Haggai attributes a recent drought to the people&#x27;s refusal to rebuild the temple, which he sees as key to Jerusalemâs glory. The book ends with the prediction of the downfall of kingdoms, with one Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, as the Lord&#x27;s chosen leader. The language here is not as finely wrought as in some other books of the minor prophets, yet the intent seems straightforward.

The first chapter contains the first address (2â11) and its effects (12â15).

The second chapter contains:
#The second prophecy (1â9), which was delivered a month after the first
#The third prophecy (10â19), delivered two months and three days after the second; and
#The fourth prophecy (20â23), delivered on the same day as the third.

These discourses are referred to in Ezra 5:1 and 6:14. (Compare Haggai 2:7, 8 and 22)

Haggai reports that three weeks after his first prophecy the rebuilding of the Temple began on September 7 521Â BC. &quot;They came and began to work on the house of the LORD Almighty, their God, on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month in the second year of Darius the King.&quot; (Haggai 1:14â15) and the Book of Ezra indicates that it was finished on February 25 516Â BC &quot;The Temple was completed on the third day of the month Adar, in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius.&quot; (Ezra 6:15)

<doc id="4455" wikidata="Q51675" url="?curid=4455" title="Book of Malachi">
<text>The Book of Malachi (Hebrew: , &quot;&quot;) is the last book of the Neviim contained in the Tanakh, canonically the last of the Twelve Minor Prophets. In most Christian orderings, the grouping of the prophetic books is the last section of the Old Testament, making Malachi the last book before the New Testament.

The author may or may not have been identified by the title Malachi. Its title has frequently been understood as a proper name, although its Hebrew meaning is simply &quot;My Messenger&quot; (the Septuagint reads &quot;his messenger&quot;) and would not have been a proper name at the time of its writing. &quot;Malachi&quot; is often assumed to be a pseudonym used by the real writer so he would not face retribution for his prophecies. Jewish tradition states that the book was written by Ezra the scribe.

Most scholars regard The Book of Malachi as the result of multiple stages of redaction; most of its text originated in the Persian period, with the oldest stratum from around 500 BCE and redactions into the Hellenistic period.

==Oldest surviving manuscripts==

The original manuscript of this book is lost, as are many centuries worth of copies. The oldest surviving manuscripts containing some or all of this book in Hebrew are in the Masoretic Text tradition, which includes the Codex Cairensis (895), the Petersburg Codex of the Prophets (916), Aleppo Codex (10th century), and Codex Leningradensis (1008). Fragments containing parts of this book were also found among Dead Sea Scrolls 4Q76 (150â125 BCE) and 4Q78 (75â50 BCE).

There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BCE. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (4th century), Codex Sinaiticus (4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (5th century) and Codex Marchalianus (6th century).

==Authorship==
Little is known of the biography of the author of the Book of Malachi, although it has been suggested that he may have been Levitical. Due to the similarities between Malachi and Ezra&#x27;s emphasis on forbidding marriage to foreign pagan women, the Talmud and certain Targums, such as Targum Jonathan, identify Ezra as the author of Malachi. This is the traditional view held by most Jews and some Christians. The Catholic priest and historian Jerome suggests that this may be because Ezra is seen as an intermediary between the prophets and the &quot;great synagogue.&quot; According to Josephus, Ezra died and was buried &quot;in a magnificent manner in Jerusalem.&quot; If the tradition that Ezra wrote under the name &quot;Malachi&quot; is correct, then he was probably buried in the Tomb of the Prophets, the traditional resting place of Malachi, Haggai, and Zechariah.

The name &quot;Malachi&quot; occurs in the superscription at 1:1 and in 3:1, although most consider it unlikely that the word refers to the same character in both of these references. According to the editors of the 1897 Easton&#x27;s Bible Dictionary, some scholars believe the name &quot;Malachi&quot; is not a proper noun but rather an abbreviation of &quot;messenger of Yah&quot;. This reading could be based on Malachi 3:1, &quot;Behold, I will send &quot;my messenger&quot;...&quot;, if &quot;my messenger&quot; is taken literally as the name &quot;Malachi&quot;. Thus, there is substantial debate regarding the identity of the book&#x27;s author and many assume that &quot;Malachi&quot; is an anonymous pen-name. However, others disagree. Other scholars, including the editors of the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;, argue that the grammatical evidence leads us to conclude that Malachi is in fact a name, asserting: &quot;We are no doubt in presence of an abbreviation of the name &quot;MÃ¡l&#x27;akhÃ®yah&quot;, that is Messenger of Elohim.&quot;

Some scholars consider both Zechariah 9â14 and Malachi to be anonymous, which explains their placement at the end of the twelve minor prophets. Julius Wellhausen, Abraham Kuenen, and Wilhelm Gustav Hermann Nowack argue that Malachi 1:1 is a late addition, pointing to Zechariah 9:1 and 12:1. Another interpretation of the authorship comes from the Septuagint superscription, , which can be read as either &quot;by the hand of his messenger&quot; or as &quot;by the hand of his angel&quot;. The &quot;angel&quot; reading found an echo among the ancient Church Fathers and ecclesiastical writers, and even gave rise to the &quot;strangest fancies&quot;, especially among the disciples of Origen.

==Period==
There are very few historical details in the Book of Malachi. The greatest clue as to its dating may lie in the fact that the Persian-era term for governor () is used in 1:8. This points to a post-exilic (that is, after 538 BCE) date of composition both because of the use of the Persian period term and because Judah had a king before the exile. Since, in the same verse, the temple has been rebuilt, the book must also be later than 515Â BCE. Malachi was apparently known to the author of the Book of Sirach early in the second century BCE. Because of the development of themes in the book of Malachi, most scholars assign it to a position after the Book of Haggai and the Book of Zechariah, close to the time when Ezra and Nehemiah came to Jerusalem in 445Â BCE.

== Aim ==
The Book of Malachi was written to correct what the author saw as the lax religious and social behavior of the Israelites â particularly the priests â in post-exilic Jerusalem. Although the prophets urged the people of Judah and Israel to see their exile as punishment for failing to uphold their covenant with God, it was not long after they had been restored to the land and to Temple worship that the people&#x27;s commitment to their God began, once again, to wane. It was in this context that the prophet commonly referred to as Malachi delivered his prophecy.

In 1:2, Malachi has the people of Israel question God&#x27;s love for them. This introduction to the book illustrates the severity of the situation which Malachi addresses. The graveness of the situation is also indicated by the dialectical style with which Malachi confronts his audience. Malachi proceeds to accuse his audience of failing to respect God as God deserves. One way in which this disrespect is made manifest is through the substandard sacrifices which Malachi claims are being offered by the priests. While God demands animals that are &quot;without blemish&quot; (Leviticus 1:3, NRSV), the priests, who were &quot;to determine whether the animal was acceptable&quot; (Mason 143), were offering blind, lame and sick animals for sacrifice because they thought nobody would notice.

In 2:1, Malachi states Yahweh Sabaoth is sending a curse on the priests who have not honored him with appropriate animal sacrifices: &quot;Now, watch how I am going to paralyze your arm and throw dung in your face--the dung from your very solemnities--and sweep you away with it. Then you shall learn that it is I who have given you this warning of my intention to abolish my covenant with Levi, says Yahweh Sabaoth.&quot;

In 2:10, Malachi addresses the issue of divorce. On this topic, Malachi deals with divorce both as a social problem (&quot;Why then are we faithless to one another ... ?&quot; 2:10) and as a religious problem (&quot;Judah ... has married the daughter of a foreign god&quot; 2:11). In contrast to the book of Ezra, Malachi urges each to remain steadfast to the wife of his youth.

Malachi also criticizes his audience for questioning God&#x27;s justice. He reminds them that God is just, exhorting them to be faithful as they await that justice. Malachi quickly goes on to point out that the people have not been faithful. In fact, the people are not giving God all that God deserves. Just as the priests have been offering unacceptable sacrifices, so the people have been neglecting to offer their full tithe to God.

== Interpretations ==

The book of Malachi is divided into three chapters in the Hebrew Bible and the Greek Septuagint and four chapters in the Latin Vulgate. The fourth chapter in the Vulgate consists of the remainder of the third chapter starting at verse 3:19.

===Christianity===
The New Revised Standard Version of the Bible supplies headings for the book as follows:

The majority of scholars consider the book to be made up of six distinct oracles. According to this scheme, the book of Malachi consists of a series of disputes between Yahweh and the various groups within the Israelite community. In the course of the book&#x27;s three or four chapters, Yahweh is vindicated while those who do not adhere to the law of Moses are condemned. Some scholars have suggested that the book, as a whole, is structured along the lines of a judicial trial, a suzerain treaty or a covenantâone of the major themes throughout the Hebrew Scriptures. Implicit in the prophet&#x27;s condemnation of Israel&#x27;s religious practices is a call to keep Yahweh&#x27;s statutes.

The Book of Malachi draws upon various themes found in other books of the Bible. Malachi appeals to the rivalry between Jacob and Esau and of Yahweh&#x27;s preference for Jacob contained in Book of Genesis 25â28. Malachi reminds his audience that, as descendants of Jacob (Israel), they have been and continue to be favoured by God as God&#x27;s chosen people. In the second dispute, Malachi draws upon the Levitical Code (e.g. Leviticus 1:3) in condemning the priest for offering unacceptable sacrifices.

In the third dispute (concerning divorce), the author of the Book of Malachi likely intends his argument to be understood on two levels. Malachi appears to be attacking either the practice of divorcing Jewish wives in favour of foreign ones (a practice which Ezra vehemently condemns) or, alternatively, Malachi could be condemning the practice of divorcing foreign wives in favour of Jewish wives (a practice which Ezra promoted). Malachi appears adamant that nationality is not a valid reason to terminate a marriage, &quot;For I hate divorce, says the Lord . . .&quot; (2:16).

In many places throughout the Hebrew Scriptures â particularly the Book of Hosea â Israel is figured as Yahweh&#x27;s wife or bride. Malachi&#x27;s discussion of divorce may also be understood to conform to this metaphor. Malachi could very well be urging his audience not to break faith with Yahweh (the God of Israel) by adopting new gods or idols. It is quite likely that, since the people of Judah were questioning Yahweh&#x27;s love and justice (1:2, 2:17), they might be tempted to adopt foreign gods. William LaSor suggests that, because the restoration to the land of Judah had not resulted in anything like the prophesied splendor of the messianic age which had been prophesied, the people were becoming quite disillusioned with their religion.

Indeed, the fourth dispute asserts that judgment is coming in the form of a messenger who &quot;is like refiner&#x27;s fire and like fullers&#x27; soap . . .&quot; (3:2).

Following this, the prophet provides another example of wrongdoing in the fifth dispute â that is, failing to offer full tithes. In this discussion, Malachi has Yahweh request the people to &quot;Bring the full tithe . . . [and] see if I will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour down on you an overflowing blessing&quot; (3:10). This request offers the opportunity for the people to amend their ways. It also stresses that keeping the Lord&#x27;s statutes will not only allow the people to avoid God&#x27;s wrath, but will also lead to God&#x27;s blessing. (It is this portion of Malachi which is used as support for the view that tithing is required of Christians.)

In the sixth dispute, the people of Israel illustrate the extent of their disillusionment. Malachi has them say &quot;&#x27;It is vain to serve God . . . Now we count the arrogant happy; evildoers not only prosper, but when they put God to the test they escape&#x27;&quot; (3:14â15). Once again, Malachi has Yahweh assure the people that the wicked will be punished and the faithful will be rewarded.

In the light of what Malachi understands to be an imminent judgment, he exhorts his audience to &quot;Remember the teaching of my servant Moses, that statutes and ordinances that I commanded him at Horeb for all Israel&quot; (4:4; 3:22, MT). Before the Day of the Lord, Malachi declares that Elijah (who &quot;ascended in a whirlwind into heaven . . . [,]&quot; 2 Kings 2:11) will return to earth in order that people might follow in God&#x27;s ways.

Primarily because of its messianic promise, the Book of Malachi is frequently referred to in the Christian New Testament. What follows is a brief comparison between the Book of Malachi and the New Testament texts which refer to it (as suggested in Hill 84â88).

Although many Christians believe that the messianic prophecies of the Book of Malachi have been fulfilled in the life of Jesus, most Jews continue to await the coming of the prophet Elijah who will prepare the way for the Lord.

<text>The Book of Zechariah is a Jewish text attributed to Zechariah, a Hebrew prophet of the late 6th century BC. In the Hebrew Bible, the text is included as part of the Twelve Minor Prophets, itself a part of the second division of that work. In the Christian Old Testament, the Book of Zechariah is considered to be a separate book.

==Historical context==
One of the three prophets from the post-exilic period, Zechariah&#x27;s prophecies took place during the reign of Darius the Great. Chapters 1â8 of the book are contemporary with the prophecies of Haggai, while chapters 9â14 (often termed Second Zechariah) are thought to have been written much laterâin the 5th century, during the late Persian or early Ptolemaic period. Scholars believe that Ezekiel, with his blending of ceremony and vision, heavily influenced the visionary works of Zechariah 1â8.

During the exile, a significant portion of the population of the Kingdom of Judah was taken to Babylon, where the prophets told them to make their homes, suggesting they would spend a long time there. Cyrus the Great conquered the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 539 BC. The following year, he released the Edict of Cyrus, which marked the beginning of the first return to Judah under Sheshbazzar.

Darius acceded to the throne in 522 BC. He divided the many regions of the empire into provinces, each of which was overseen by a governor. Zerubbabel was appointed by Darius as governor over Judah (now redesignated the province of Yehud Medinata of the Persian Empire). Under the reign of Darius, Zechariah also emerged, focusing his prophecies on the rebuilding of the Temple. Unlike the Babylonians, the Persian Empire went to great lengths to keep cordial relations between vassal and lord. The rebuilding of the Temple was encouraged by the Persian monarchs in hopes that it would stabilize the local population. This policy was good politics on the part of the Persians, and the Jews viewed it as a blessing from God.

== Prophet ==
The name &quot;Zechariah&quot; means &quot;God remembered.&quot; Not much is known about Zechariah&#x27;s life other than what may be inferred from the book. It has been speculated that his grandfather Iddo was the head of a priestly family who returned with Zerubbabel and that Zechariah may have been a priest as well as a prophet. This is supported by Zechariah&#x27;s interest in the Temple and the priesthood, and from Iddo&#x27;s preaching in the Books of Chronicles.

== Authorship ==

Most modern scholars believe the Book of Zechariah was written by at least two different people. Zechariah 1â8, sometimes referred to as First Zechariah, was written in the 6th century BC and contains oracles from the historical prophet Zechariah, who lived in the Achaemenid Empire during the kingdom of Darius the Great. Zechariah 9â14, often called Second Zechariah, contains within the text no datable references to specific events or individuals, but most scholars give the text a date in the 5th century BC. Second Zechariah, in the opinion of some scholars, appears to make use of the books of Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, the Deuteronomistic history, and the themes from First Zechariah. This has led some to believe that the writer(s) or editor(s) of Second Zechariah may have been a disciple of the prophet Zechariah. There are some scholars who go even further and divide Second Zechariah into Second Zechariah (9â11) and Third Zechariah (12â14) since each begins with a heading oracle.

== Composition ==
The return from exile is the theological premise of the prophet&#x27;s visions in chapters 1â6. Chapters 7â8 address the quality of life God wants his renewed people to enjoy, containing many encouraging promises to them. Chapters 9â14 comprise two &quot;oracles&quot; of the future.

===Chapters 1 to 6===
The book begins with a preface in verses 1:1-6, which recalls the role of the &quot;former prophets&quot; in calling Israel in times past to repentance. Then follows a series of eight visions succeeding one another in one night, which may be regarded as a symbolical history of Israel, intended to furnish consolation to the returned exiles and to stir up hope in their minds. These visions include seeing four horses, four horns and four craftsmen, a man with a measuring line, Joshua the High Priest, a gold lampstand and two olive trees, a flying scroll and a woman in a basket, and four chariots. The symbolic action, the crowning of Joshua, describes how the kingdoms of the world become the kingdom of God&#x27;s Messiah.

The German commentators Carl Friedrich Keil and Franz Delitzsch enumerate seven visions, arguing that the visions conventionally numbered as the sixth and the seventh are better treated as a single vision.

===Chapters 7 and 8===
Two years after the initial visions, chapters 7 and 8 are delivered. They are an answer to the question whether the days of mourning for the destruction of the city should be kept any longer. The answer is addressed to the entire people, assuring them of God&#x27;s presence and blessing.

===Chapters 9 to 14===
This section consists of two &quot;oracles&quot; or &quot;burdens&quot;: the opening words of both chapter 9 and chapter 12 (and also the first chapter of Malachi) announce &quot;The burden of the word of the Lord&quot;.
*The first oracle (Zechariah 9â11) gives an outline of the course of God&#x27;s providential dealings with his people down to the time of the coming of the Messiah, although the opening &quot;burden&quot; is addressed to the foreign nations.
*The second oracle (Zechariah 12â14) points out the glories that await Israel in &quot;the latter day&quot;, the final conflict and triumph of God&#x27;s kingdom. The &quot;burden&quot; in Zechariah 12:1 stands against Israel.
Katrina Larkin argues that there is a unity across these six chapters established by a series of short &quot;linking passages&quot; at 9:9-10, 10:1-2, 11:1-3, 11:17 and 13:7-9&quot;. She refers to these passages as compact and metrical, addressed directly to their audience, which contain material linking with both the previous and the subsequent text.

== Themes ==

The purpose of this book is not strictly historical but theological and pastoral. The main emphasis is that God is at work, and all his good deeds, including the construction of the Second Temple, are accomplished &quot;not by might nor by power, but by [his] Spirit&quot;. Ultimately, YHWH plans to live again with his people in Jerusalem. He will save them from their enemies and cleanse them from sin. However, God requires repentance, a turning away from sin towards faith in him.

Zechariah&#x27;s concern for purity is apparent in the temple, priesthood, and all areas of life as the prophecy gradually eliminates the governor&#x27;s influence in favour of the high priest, and the sanctuary becomes ever more clearly the centre of messianic fulfillment. The prominence of prophecy is quite apparent in Zechariah, but it is also true that Zechariah (along with Haggai) allows prophecy to yield to the priesthood; this is particularly apparent in comparing Zechariah to Third Isaiah (chapters 55â66 of the Book of Isaiah), whose author was active sometime after the first return from exile.

Most Christian commentators read the series of predictions in chapters 7 to 14 as Messianic prophecies, either directly or indirectly. These chapters helped the writers of the Gospels understand Jesus&#x27;s suffering, death, and resurrection, which they quoted as they wrote of Jesus&#x27;s final days. Much of the Book of Revelation, which narrates the denouement of history, is also colored by images in Zechariah.

===Apocalyptic literature===
Chapters 9â14 of the Book of Zechariah are an early example of apocalyptic literature. Although not as fully developed as the apocalyptic visions described in the Book of Daniel, the &quot;oracles&quot;, as they are titled in these chapters, contain apocalyptic elements. One theme these oracles contain is descriptions of the Day of the Lord, when &quot;the Lord will go forth and fight against those nations as when he fights on a day of battle&quot;. These chapters also contain &quot;pessimism about the present, but optimism for the future based on the expectation of an ultimate divine victory and the subsequent transformation of the cosmos&quot;.

The final portion in Zechariah states that on the Day of the Lord, &quot;there shall be no more the Canaanite in the house of the &quot;, proclaiming the need for purity in the Temple, which would come when God judged at the end of time. The Hebrew word , often translated as &quot;Canaanite&quot;, is alternatively translated as &quot;trader&quot; or &quot;trafficker&quot;, as in other translations.
