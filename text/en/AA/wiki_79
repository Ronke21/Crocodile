<text>The Book of Zephaniah (, &quot;Ṣəfanyā&quot;; sometimes Latinized as &quot;Sophonias&quot;) is the ninth of the Twelve Minor Prophets of the Old Testament and Tanakh, preceded in all traditions by the Book of Habakkuk and followed by the Book of Haggai. Zephaniah is a male given name which is usually interpreted to mean &quot;Yahweh has hidden/protected&quot;, or &quot;Yahweh hides&quot;. The church father Jerome of Stridon interpreted Zephaniah&#x27;s name to mean &quot;the watchman of the Lord&quot;. The original text of the prophecy was written in Biblical Hebrew.

Scholars propose various dates of composition; Zephaniah 2’s oracles may have a seventh century BCE date with the book possibly growing out from that core, while the number of intertextual references suggests an exilic or later composition and editing.

== Authorship and date ==

The book&#x27;s superscription attributes its authorship to &quot;Zephaniah son of Cushi son of Gedaliah son of Amariah son of Hezekiah, in the days of King Josiah son of Amon of Judah&quot;. All that is known of Zephaniah comes from within the text.

The name &quot;Cushi,&quot; Zephaniah&#x27;s father, means &quot;Cushite&quot; or &quot;Ethiopian&quot;, and the text of Zephaniah mentions the sin and restoration of &quot;Cushim&quot;. While some have concluded from this that Zephaniah was dark-skinned or African, Ehud Ben Zvi maintains that, based on the context, &quot;Cushi&quot; must be understood as a personal name rather than an indicator of nationality. Abraham ibn Ezra interpreted the name Hezekiah in the superscription as King Hezekiah of Judah, though that is not a claim advanced in the text of Zephaniah.

As with many of the other prophets, there is no external evidence to directly associate composition of the book with a prophet by the name of Zephaniah. Some scholars, such as Kent Harold Richards and Jason DeRouchie, consider the words in Zephaniah to reflect a time early in the reign of King Josiah (640–609 BC) before his reforms of 622 BC took full effect, in which case the prophet may have been born during the reign of Manasseh (698/687–642 BC). Others argue that some portion of the book is postmonarchic, that is, dating to later than 586 BC when the Kingdom of Judah fell in the Siege of Jerusalem. Some who consider the book to have largely been written by a historical Zephaniah have suggested that he may have been a disciple of the prophet Isaiah, because of the two books&#x27; similar focus on rampant corruption and injustice in Judah. The Jerusalem Bible links Zephaniah 2:11 and 3:9-10 with the Book of Consolation (Isaiah 40-55).

== Purpose ==
If Zephaniah was largely composed during the monarchic period, then its composition was occasioned by Judah&#x27;s refusal to obey its covenant obligations toward Yahweh despite having seen northern Israel&#x27;s exile a generation or two previously, an exile which the Judahite literary tradition attributed to Yahweh&#x27;s anger aroused by Israel&#x27;s disobedience to the covenant. In this historical context, Zephaniah urges Judah to obedience to Yahweh, saying that &quot;perhaps&quot; he will forgive them if they do.

== Themes ==

&quot;The HarperCollins Study Bible&quot; supplies headings for sections within the book as follows:

More consistently than any other prophetic book, Zephaniah focuses on &quot;the day of the Lord&quot;, developing this tradition from its first appearance in Amos. The day of the Lord tradition also appears in Isaiah, Ezekiel, Obadiah, Joel, and Malachi.

The book begins by describing Yahweh&#x27;s judgement. With a triple repetition of &quot;I will sweep away&quot; in Zephaniah 1:2–3, Zephaniah emphasizes the totality of the destruction, as the number three often signifies perfection in the Bible. The order of creatures in Zephaniah 1:2 (&quot;humans and animals ... the birds ... the fish&quot;) is the opposite of the creation order in Genesis 1:1–28, signifying an undoing of creation. This is also signified by the way that &quot;from the face of the earth&quot; forms an &quot;inclusio&quot; around Zephaniah 1:2-3, hearkening back to how the phrase is used in the Genesis flood narrative in Genesis 6:7, Genesis 7:4, and Genesis 8:8, where it also connotes an undoing of creation.

As is common in prophetic literature in the Bible, a &quot;remnant&quot; survives Yahweh&#x27;s judgement, by humbly seeking refuge in Yahweh. The book concludes with an announcement of hope and joy, as Yahweh &quot;bursts forth in joyful divine celebration&quot; over his people.

==Later influence==
Because of its hopeful tone of the gathering and restoration of exiles, has been included in Jewish liturgy.

Zephaniah served as a major inspiration for the medieval Catholic hymn &quot;Dies Irae,&quot; whose title and opening words are from the Vulgate translation of .

==Surviving early manuscripts==

The original manuscript of this book has been lost. Some early manuscripts containing the text of this book in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text tradition, which includes the Codex Cairensis (895), the Petersburg Codex of the Prophets (916), Aleppo Codex (10th century), Codex Leningradensis (1008). Fragments containing parts of this book in Hebrew were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, including 4Q77 (4QXIIb; 150–125 BCE), 4Q78 (4QXIIc; 75–50 BCE), and Wadi Murabba&#x27;at Minor Prophets (Mur88; MurXIIProph; 75-100 CE).

There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BC. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (4th century), Codex Sinaiticus (4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (5th century) and Codex Marchalianus (6th century). Some fragments containing parts of the Septuagint version of this book were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, i.e., Naḥal Ḥever (1st century CE).

<doc id="4458" wikidata="Q179760" url="?curid=4458" title="Book of Habakkuk">
<text>The Book of Habakkuk is the eighth book of the 12 minor prophets of the Bible. It is attributed to the prophet Habakkuk. Due to the limited historical data, scholars have proposed a broad range of dates for the composition of the book; many agree that the period during Jehoiakim’s reign (609–597 BCE) aligns well with the context described in Habakkuk. It is an important text in Judaism, and passages from the book are quoted by authors of the New Testament, and its message has inspired modern Christian hymn writers.

Of the three chapters in the book, the first two are a dialogue between Yahweh and the prophet. A verse in chapter 2 stating that &quot;the just shall live by his faith&quot; plays an important role in Christian thought. It is used in the Epistle to the Romans, Epistle to the Galatians, and the Epistle to the Hebrews as the starting point of the concept of faith. A copy of these two chapters is included in the Habakkuk Commentary, found among the Dead Sea Scrolls. Chapter 3 is now recognized as a liturgical piece. It is debated whether chapter 3 and the first two chapters were written by the same author.

== Background ==
The prophet Habakkuk is generally believed to have written his book in the mid-to-late 7th century BC. It is likely that it was written shortly after the Fall of Nineveh (in 612 BC) and before the Babylonian capture of Jerusalem (in 586 BC).

===Author===

Habakkuk identifies himself as a prophet in the opening verse. Due to the liturgical nature of the book of Habakkuk, there have been some scholars who think that the author may have been a temple prophet. Temple prophets are described in 1 Chronicles 25:1 as using lyres, harps and cymbals. Some feel that this is echoed in Habakkuk 3:19b, and that Habakkuk may have been a Levite and singer in the Temple.

There is no biographical information on the prophet Habakkuk. The only canonical information that exists comes from the book that is named for him. His name comes either from the Hebrew word (&quot;ḥavaq&quot;) meaning &quot;embrace&quot; or else from an Akkadian word &quot;hambakuku&quot; for a kind of plant.

Although his name does not appear in any other part of the Jewish Bible, Rabbinic tradition holds Habakkuk to be the Shunammite woman&#x27;s son, who was restored to life by Elisha in 2 Kings 4:16. The prophet Habakkuk is also mentioned in the narrative of Bel and the Dragon, part of the deuterocanonical additions to Daniel in a late section of that book. In the superscription of the Old Greek version, Habakkuk is called the son of Joshua of the tribe of Levi. In this book Habakkuk is lifted by an angel to Babylon to provide Daniel with some food while he is in the lion&#x27;s den.

===Historical context===

It is unknown when Habakkuk lived and preached, but the reference to the rise and advance of the Chaldeans in 1:6–11 places him in the middle to last quarter of the 7th century BC. One possible period might be during the reign of Jehoiakim, from 609 to 598 BC. The reasoning for this date is that it is during his reign that the Neo-Babylonian Empire of the Chaldeans was growing in power. The Babylonians marched against Jerusalem in 598 BC. Jehoiakim died while the Babylonians were marching towards Jerusalem and Jehoiakim&#x27;s eighteen-year-old son Jehoiachin assumed the throne. Upon the Babylonians&#x27; arrival, Jehoiachin and his advisors surrendered Jerusalem after a short time. With the transition of rulers and the young age and inexperience of Jehoiachin, they were not able to stand against Chaldean forces. There is a sense of an intimate knowledge of the Babylonian brutality in 1:12–17.

== Overview ==
The book of Habakkuk is a book of the Tanakh (the Old Testament) and stands eighth in a section known as the 12 Minor Prophets in the Masoretic and Greek texts. In the Masoretic listing, it follows Nahum and precedes Zephaniah, who are considered to be his contemporaries.

The book consists of three chapters and the book is neatly divided into three different genres:
* A discussion between God and Habakkuk
* An oracle of woe
* A psalm, &quot;Habakkuk&#x27;s song&quot;.

== Themes ==
The major theme of Habakkuk is trying to grow from a faith of perplexity and doubt to the height of absolute trust in God. Habakkuk addresses his concerns over the fact that God will use the Babylonian empire to execute judgment on Judah for their sins.

Habakkuk openly questions the wisdom of God. In the first part of the first chapter, the Prophet sees the injustice among his people and asks why God does not take action. &quot;Yahweh, how long will I cry, and you will not hear? I cry out to you “Violence!” and will you not save?&quot; – (Habakkuk 1:2)

In the middle part of Chapter 1, God explains that he will send the Chaldeans (also known as the Babylonians) to punish his people. In 1:5: &quot;Look among the nations, watch, and wonder marvelously; for I am working a work in your days, which you will not believe though it is told you.&quot; In 1:6: &quot;For, behold, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, that march through the breadth of the earth, to possess dwelling places that are not theirs.&quot;

One of the &quot;Eighteen Emendations to the Hebrew Scriptures&quot; appears at 1:12. According to the professional Jewish scribes, the Sopherim, the text of 1:12 was changed from &quot;You [God] do not die&quot; to &quot;We shall not die&quot;. The Sopherim considered it disrespectful to say to God, &quot;&quot;You&quot; do not die.&quot;

In the final part of the first chapter, the prophet expresses shock at God&#x27;s choice of instrument for judgment, in 1:13: &quot;You who have purer eyes than to see evil, and who cannot look on perversity, why do you tolerate those who deal treacherously, and keep silent when the wicked swallows up the man who is more righteous than he[...]?&quot;

In Chapter 2, he awaits God&#x27;s response to his challenge. God explains that He will also judge the Chaldeans, and much more harshly. &quot;Because you have plundered many nations, all the remnant of the peoples will plunder you, because of men’s blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all who dwell in it. Woe to him who gets an evil gain for his house.&quot; (Habakkuk 2:8-9)

Finally, in Chapter 3, Habakkuk expresses his ultimate faith in God, even if he does not fully understand: &quot;For though the fig tree doesn’t flourish, nor fruit be in the vines; the labor of the olive fails, the fields yield no food; the flocks are cut off from the fold, and there is no herd in the stalls: 3:18 yet I will rejoice in Yahweh. I will be joyful in the God of my salvation!&quot; Some scholars suggest that the final chapter may be a later independent addition to the book, in part because it is not included among the Dead Sea Scrolls.

==Surviving early manuscripts==

Some early manuscripts containing the text of this book in Hebrew language are found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, i.e., 1QpHab, known as the &quot;Habakkuk Commentary&quot; (later half of the 1st century BC), and of the Masoretic Text tradition, which includes Codex Cairensis (895 CE), the Petersburg Codex of the Prophets (916), Aleppo Codex (10th century), Codex Leningradensis (1008). Fragments containing parts of this book in Hebrew were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, including 4Q82 (4QXIIg; 25 BCE) with extant verses 4?; and Wadi Murabba&#x27;at Minor Prophets (Mur88; MurXIIProph; 75-100 CE) with extant verses 1:3–13, 1:15, 2:2–3, 2:5–11, 2:18–20, and 3:1–19.

There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BC. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; formula_1B; 4th century), Codex Sinaiticus (S; BHK: formula_1S; 4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (A; formula_1A; 5th century) and Codex Marchalianus (Q; formula_1Q; 6th century). Fragments containing parts of this book in Greek were also found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, that is, Naḥal Ḥever 8Ḥev1 (8ḤevXIIgr); (late 1st century BCE) with extant verses 1:5–11, 1:14–17, 2:1–8, 2:13–20, and 3:8–15.

== Importance ==
The Book of Habakkuk is accepted as canonical by adherents of the Jewish and Christian faiths.

===Judaism===
The Book of Habakkuk is the eighth book of the Twelve Prophets of the Hebrew Bible, and this collection appears in all copies of texts of the Septuagint, the Ancient Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible completed by 132 BC. Likewise, the book of Sirach (or Ecclesiasticus), also written in the 2nd century BC, mentions &quot;The Twelve Prophets&quot;.

A partial copy of Habakkuk itself is included in the Habakkuk Commentary, a &quot;pesher&quot; found among the original seven Dead Sea Scrolls discovered in 1947. The Commentary contains a copy of the first two chapters of Habakkuk, but not of the third chapter. The writer of the &quot;pesher&quot; draws a comparison between the Babylonian invasion of the original text and the Roman threat of the writer&#x27;s own period. What is even more significant than the commentary in the &quot;pesher&quot; is the quoted text of Habakkuk itself. The divergences between the Hebrew text of the scroll and the standard Masoretic Text are startlingly minimal. The biggest differences are word order, small grammatical variations, addition or omission of conjunctions, and spelling variations, but these are small enough not to damage the meaning of the text.

Some scholars suggest that Chapter 3 may be a later independent addition to the book, in part because it is not included among the Dead Sea Scrolls. However, this chapter does appear in all copies of the Septuagint, as well as in texts from as early as the 3rd century BC. This final chapter is a poetic praise of God, and has some similarities with Exodus 19, and with texts found in the Book of Daniel. However, the fact that the third chapter is written in a different style, as a liturgical piece, does not necessarily mean that Habakkuk was not also its author.

===Qumran community===
A commentary on the first two chapters of the book was found among the Dead Sea Scrolls at Qumran. The omission of chapter 3 from the version within the Dead Sea Scrolls has been attributed to incompatibilities with the theology of the Qumran sect.

==Habakkuk 2:4==
The Talmud (Makkot 24a) mentions that various Biblical figures grouped the 613 commandments into categories that encapsulated all of the 613. At the end of this discussion, the Talmud concludes, &quot;Habakkuk came and established [the 613 mitzvoth] upon one, as it is stated: &#x27;But the righteous person shall live by his faith&#x27; (Habakkuk 2:4)&quot;.

Habakkuk 2:4 is well known in Christianity. In the New International Version of the bible it reads:

:&quot;See, the enemy is puffed up; his desires are not upright&quot;
::&quot;but the righteous person will live by his faithfulness.&quot;

Although the second half of this passage is only three words in the original Hebrew, it is quoted three times in the New Testament. Paul the Apostle quotes it once in his Epistle to the Romans, and again in his Epistle to the Galatians; its third use is in the Epistle to the Hebrews. It became one of the most important of the verses that were used as foundations of the doctrines of the Protestant reformation.

There is controversy about the translation of the verse: the word &quot;emunah&quot; is most often translated as &quot;faithfulness&quot;, though the word in this verse has been traditionally translated as &quot;faith&quot;.

The word &quot;emunah&quot; is not translated as &quot;belief&quot; other than in Habakkuk 2:4, Clendenen, E. Ray defended the translation of the word as &quot;faith&quot; on the basis of the context of the verse, arguing that it refers to &quot;Genesis 15:6&quot;, which used the word &quot;he’ĕmin&quot; &#x27;believed&#x27; of which &quot;’ĕmȗnāh&quot; is derived from, he also argued that the Essenes in the Qumran community likely understood the verse as referring to faith in the Teacher of Righteousness instead of faithfulness.

Martin Luther believed that Habakkuk 2:4 taught the doctrine of faith alone, commenting on the verse &quot;For this is a general saying applicable to all of God&#x27;s words. These must be believed, whether spoken at the beginning, middle, or end of the world&quot;.

Rashi interpreted the verse to be about Jeconiah.

The Targum interpreted the verse as &quot;The wicked think that all these things are not so, but the righteous live by the truth of them&quot;.

Pseudo-Ignatius understood the verse to be about faith.

==Habakkuk 2:6-20: the taunting riddle==
The melitzah ḥidah, or the taunting riddle, is the oracle revealed to Habakkuk the prophet. It is a mashal, which is a proverb and a parable. It is also known as a witty satire, a mocking and an enigma. The riddle is 15 verses long, from verse 6 to verse 20, and is divided into five woes which consist of three verses each.

===Hebrew Text===
The following table shows the Hebrew text of Habakkuk 2:6-20 with vowels alongside an English translation based upon the JPS 1917 translation (now in the public domain).
==Habakkuk 3:1==
:&quot;A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, according to Shigionoth.&quot;
This verse is a heading for the final chapter. The exact meaning of &quot;Shigionoth&quot; is not known. The New Living Translation treats the word as an addition in the Hebrew text which &quot;probably&quot; indicates the prayer&#x27;s musical setting, and the Jerusalem Bible suggests that the prayer adopts &quot;the tone as for dirges&quot;.

==Musical uses==
Modern Christian hymns have been inspired by the words of the prophet Habakkuk:
*the Christian hymn &quot;&quot;, written in 1900 by William J. Kirkpatrick, is based on Habakkuk 2:20.
*the fourth verse of William Cowper&#x27;s hymn &quot;Sometimes a Light Surprises&quot;, written in 1779, quotes Habakkuk 3:17–18:

Irish composer Charles Villiers Stanford set slightly revised portions of text from the first and second chapters of Habakkuk in his choral composition for choir, soprano and tenor soloist and organ, &quot;For Lo, I Raise Up&quot;.

<doc id="4459" wikidata="Q844605" url="?curid=4459" title="Backward compatibility">
<text>In telecommunications and computing, backward compatibility (or backwards compatibility) is a property of an operating system, software, real-world product, or technology that allows for interoperability with an older legacy system, or with input designed for such a system.

Modifying a system in a way that does not allow backward compatibility is sometimes called &quot;&quot; backward compatibility. Such breaking usually incurs various types of costs, such as switching cost.

A complementary concept is &quot;forward compatibility&quot;; a design that is forward-compatible usually has a roadmap for compatibility with future standards and products.

==Usage==
===In hardware===
A simple example of both backward and forward compatibility is the introduction of FM radio in stereo. FM radio was initially mono, with only one audio channel represented by one signal. With the introduction of two-channel stereo FM radio, many listeners had only mono FM receivers. Forward compatibility for mono receivers with stereo signals was achieved by sending the sum of both left and right audio channels in one signal and the difference in another signal. That allows mono FM receivers to receive and decode the sum signal while ignoring the difference signal, which is necessary only for separating the audio channels. Stereo FM receivers can receive a mono signal and decode it without the need for a second signal, and they can separate a sum signal to left and right channels if both sum and difference signals are received. Without the requirement for backward compatibility, a simpler method could have been chosen.

Full backward compatibility is particularly important in computer instruction set architectures, two of the most successful being the IBM 360/370/390/Zseries families of mainframes, and the Intel x86 family of microprocessors.

IBM announced the first 360 models in 1964 and has continued to update the series ever since, with migration over the decades from 32-bit register/24-bit addresses to 64-bit registers and addresses.

Intel announced the first Intel 8086/8088 processors in 1978, again with migrations over the decades from 16-bit to 64-bit. (The 8086/8088, in turn, were designed with easy machine-translatability of programs written for its predecessor in mind, although they were not instruction-set compatible with the 8-bit Intel 8080 processor of 1974. The Zilog Z80, however, was fully backward compatible with the Intel 8080.)

Fully backward compatible processors can process the same binary executable software instructions as their predecessors, allowing the use of a newer processor without having to acquire new applications or operating systems. Similarly, the success of the Wi-Fi digital communication standard is attributed to its broad forward and backward compatibility; it became more popular than other standards that were not backward compatible.

=== In software ===

In software development, backward compatibility is a general notion of interoperation between software pieces that will not produce any errors when its functionality is invoked via API. The software is considered stable when its API that is used to invoke functions is stable across different versions.

In operating systems, upgrades to newer versions are said to be backward compatible if executables and other files from the previous versions will work as usual.

In compilers, backward compatibility may refer to the ability of a compiler for a newer version of the language to accept source code of programs or data that worked under the previous version.

A data format is said to be backward compatible when a newer version of the program can open it without errors just like its predecessor.

==Tradeoffs==
===Benefits===
There are several incentives for a company to implement backward compatibility. Backward compatibility can be used to preserve older software that would have otherwise been lost when a manufacturer decides to stop supporting older hardware. Classic video games are a common example used when discussing the value of supporting older software. The cultural impact of video games is a large part of their continued success, and some believe ignoring backward compatibility would cause these titles to disappear. Backward compatibility also acts as a selling point for new hardware, as an existing player base can more affordably upgrade to subsequent generations of a console. This also helps to make up for lack of titles at the launch of new systems, as users can pull from the previous console&#x27;s library of games while developers transition to the new hardware. Moreover, studies in the mid-1990s found that even consumers who never play older games after purchasing a new system consider backward compatibility a highly desirable feature, valuing the mere ability to continue to play an existing collection of games even if they choose never to do so. Backward compatibility with the original PlayStation (PS) software discs and peripherals is considered to have been a key selling point for the PlayStation 2 (PS2) during its early months on the market.

Despite not being included at launch, Microsoft slowly incorporated backward compatibility for select titles on the Xbox One several years into its product life cycle. Players have racked up over a billion hours with backward-compatible games on Xbox, and the newest generation of consoles such as PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S also support this feature. A large part of the success and implementation of this feature is that the hardware within newer generation consoles is both powerful and similar enough to legacy systems that older titles can be broken down and re-configured to run on the Xbox One. This program has proven incredibly popular with Xbox players and goes against the recent trend of studio-made remasters of classic titles, creating what some believe to be an important shift in console makers&#x27; strategies.

===Costs===
The monetary costs of supporting old software is considered a large drawback to the usage of backward compatibility. The associated costs of backward compatibility are a larger bill of materials if hardware is required to support the legacy systems; increased complexity of the product that may lead to longer time to market, technological hindrances, and slowing innovation; and increased expectations from users in terms of compatibility. It also introduces the risk that developers will favor developing games that are compatible with both the old and new systems, since this gives them a larger base of potential buyers, resulting in a dearth of software which uses the advanced features of the new system. Because of this, several console manufacturers phased out backward compatibility towards the end of the console generation in order to reduce cost and briefly reinvigorate sales before the arrival of newer hardware.

It is possible to bypass some of these hardware costs. For instance, earlier PlayStation 2 (PS2) systems used the core of the original PlayStation (PS1) CPU as a dual-purpose processor, either as the main CPU for PS1 mode or upclocking itself to offload I/O in PS2 mode. This coprocessor was replaced with a PowerPC-based processor in later systems to serve the same functions, emulating the PS1 CPU core. Such an approach can backfire, though, as was the case of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (Super NES). It opted for the more peculiar 65C816 CPU over the more popular 16-bit microprocessors on the basis that it would allow for easy backwards compatibility with the original Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), but ultimately did not proved to be workable once the rest of the Super NES&#x27;s architecture was designed.

<doc id="4460" wikidata="Q273193" url="?curid=4460" title="Bacterial conjugation">
<text>Bacterial conjugation is the transfer of genetic material between bacterial cells by direct cell-to-cell contact or by a bridge-like connection between two cells. This takes place through a pilus. It is a parasexual mode of reproduction in bacteria.

It is a mechanism of horizontal gene transfer as are transformation and transduction although these two other mechanisms do not involve cell-to-cell contact.

Classical &quot;E. coli&quot; bacterial conjugation is often regarded as the bacterial equivalent of sexual reproduction or mating, since it involves the exchange of genetic material. However, it is not sexual reproduction, since no exchange of gamete occurs, and indeed no generation of a new organism: instead, an existing organism is transformed. During classical &quot;E. coli&quot; conjugation, the &quot;donor&quot; cell provides a conjugative or mobilizable genetic element that is most often a plasmid or transposon. Most conjugative plasmids have systems ensuring that the &quot;recipient&quot; cell does not already contain a similar element.

The genetic information transferred is often beneficial to the recipient. Benefits may include antibiotic resistance, xenobiotic tolerance or the ability to use new metabolites. Other elements can be detrimental, and may be viewed as bacterial parasites.

Conjugation in &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; by spontaneous zygogenesis and in &quot;Mycobacterium smegmatis&quot; by distributive conjugal transfer differ from the better studied classical &quot;E. coli&quot; conjugation in that these cases involve substantial blending of the parental genomes.

==History==
The process was discovered by Joshua Lederberg and Edward Tatum in 1946.

== Mechanism ==
Conjugation diagram

# Donor cell produces pilus.
# Pilus attaches to recipient cell and brings the two cells together.
# The mobile plasmid is nicked and a single strand of DNA is then transferred to the recipient cell.
# Both cells synthesize a complementary strand to produce a double stranded circular plasmid and also reproduce pili; both cells are now viable donor for the F-factor.

The F-factor is an episome (a plasmid that can integrate itself into the bacterial chromosome by homologous recombination) with a length of about 100 kb. It carries its own origin of replication, the &quot;oriV&quot;, and an origin of transfer, or &quot;oriT&quot;. There can only be one copy of the F-plasmid in a given bacterium, either free or integrated, and bacteria that possess a copy are called &quot;F-positive&quot; or &quot;F-plus&quot; (denoted F+). Cells that lack F plasmids are called &quot;F-negative&quot; or &quot;F-minus&quot; (F−) and as such can function as recipient cells.

Among other genetic information, the F-plasmid carries a &quot;tra&quot; and &quot;trb&quot; locus, which together are about 33 kb long and consist of about 40 genes. The &quot;tra&quot; locus includes the &quot;pilin&quot; gene and regulatory genes, which together form pili on the cell surface. The locus also includes the genes for the proteins that attach themselves to the surface of F− bacteria and initiate conjugation. Though there is some debate on the exact mechanism of conjugation it seems that the pili are the structures through which DNA exchange occurs. The F-pili are extremely resistant to mechanical and thermochemical stress, which guarantees successful conjugation in a variety of environments. Several proteins coded for in the &quot;tra&quot; or &quot;trb&quot; locus seem to open a channel between the bacteria and it is thought that the traD enzyme, located at the base of the pilus, initiates membrane fusion.

When conjugation is initiated by a signal, the relaxase enzyme creates a nick in one of the strands of the conjugative plasmid at the &quot;oriT&quot;. Relaxase may work alone, or in a complex of over a dozen proteins known collectively as a relaxosome. In the F-plasmid system, the relaxase enzyme is called TraI and the relaxosome consists of TraI, TraY, TraM and the integrated host factor IHF. The nicked strand, or &quot;T-strand&quot;, is then unwound from the unbroken strand and transferred to the recipient cell in a 5&#x27;-terminus to 3&#x27;-terminus direction. The remaining strand is replicated either independent of conjugative action (vegetative replication beginning at the &quot;oriV&quot;) or in concert with conjugation (conjugative replication similar to the rolling circle replication of lambda phage). Conjugative replication may require a second nick before successful transfer can occur. A recent report claims to have inhibited conjugation with chemicals that mimic an intermediate step of this second nicking event.

If the F-plasmid that is transferred has previously been integrated into the donor&#x27;s genome (producing an Hfr strain [&quot;High Frequency of Recombination&quot;]) some of the donor&#x27;s chromosomal DNA may also be transferred with the plasmid DNA. The amount of chromosomal DNA that is transferred depends on how long the two conjugating bacteria remain in contact. In common laboratory strains of &quot;E. coli&quot; the transfer of the entire bacterial chromosome takes about 100 minutes. The transferred DNA can then be integrated into the recipient genome via homologous recombination.

A cell culture that contains in its population cells with non-integrated F-plasmids usually also contains a few cells that have accidentally integrated their plasmids. It is these cells that are responsible for the low-frequency chromosomal gene transfers that occur in such cultures. Some strains of bacteria with an integrated F-plasmid can be isolated and grown in pure culture. Because such strains transfer chromosomal genes very efficiently they are called Hfr (high frequency of recombination). The &quot;E. coli&quot; genome was originally mapped by interrupted mating experiments in which various Hfr cells in the process of conjugation were sheared from recipients after less than 100 minutes (initially using a Waring blender). The genes that were transferred were then investigated.

Since integration of the F-plasmid into the &quot;E. coli&quot; chromosome is a rare spontaneous occurrence, and since the numerous genes promoting DNA transfer are in the plasmid genome rather than in the bacterial genome, it has been argued that conjugative bacterial gene transfer, as it occurs in the &quot;E. coli&quot; Hfr system, is not an evolutionary adaptation of the bacterial host, nor is it likely ancestral to eukaryotic sex.

Spontaneous zygogenesis in &quot;E. coli&quot;

In addition to classical bacterial conjugation described above for &quot;E. coli&quot;, a form of conjugation referred to as spontaneous zygogenesis (Z-mating for short) is observed in certain strains of &quot;E. coli&quot;. In Z-mating there is complete genetic mixing, and unstable diploids are formed that throw off phenotypically haploid cells, of which some show a parental phenotype and some are true recombinants.

==Conjugal transfer in mycobacteria==
Conjugation in &quot;Mycobacteria smegmatis&quot;, like conjugation in &quot;E. coli&quot;, requires stable and extended contact between a donor and a recipient strain, is DNase resistant, and the transferred DNA is incorporated into the recipient chromosome by homologous recombination. However, unlike &quot;E. coli&quot; Hfr conjugation, mycobacterial conjugation is chromosome rather than plasmid based. Furthermore, in contrast to &quot;E. coli&quot; Hfr conjugation, in &quot;M. smegmatis&quot; all regions of the chromosome are transferred with comparable efficiencies. The lengths of the donor segments vary widely, but have an average length of 44.2kb. Since a mean of 13 tracts are transferred, the average total of transferred DNA per genome is 575kb. This process is referred to as &quot;Distributive conjugal transfer.&quot; Gray et al. found substantial blending of the parental genomes as a result of conjugation and regarded this blending as reminiscent of that seen in the meiotic products of sexual reproduction.

==Conjugation-like DNA transfer in hyperthermophilic archaea==
Hyperthermophilic archaea encode pili structurally similar to the bacterial conjugative pili. However, unlike in bacteria, where conjugation apparatus typically mediates the transfer of mobile genetic elements, such as plasmids or transposons, the conjugative machinery of hyperthermophilic archaea, called Ced (Crenarchaeal system for exchange of DNA) and Ted (Thermoproteales system for exchange of DNA), appears to be responsible for the transfer of cellular DNA between members of the same species. It has been suggested that in these archaea the conjugation machinery has been fully domesticated for promoting DNA repair through homologous recombination rather than spread of mobile genetic elements. In addition to the VirB2-like conjugative pilus, the Ced and Ted systems include components for the VirB6-like transmembrane mating pore and the VirB4-like ATPase.

==Inter-kingdom transfer==

Bacteria related to the nitrogen fixing &quot;Rhizobia&quot; are an interesting case of inter-kingdom conjugation. For example, the tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmid of &quot;Agrobacterium&quot; and the root-tumor inducing (Ri) plasmid of &quot;A. rhizogenes&quot; contain genes that are capable of transferring to plant cells. The expression of these genes effectively transforms the plant cells into opine-producing factories. Opines are used by the bacteria as sources of nitrogen and energy. Infected cells form crown gall or root tumors. The Ti and Ri plasmids are thus endosymbionts of the bacteria, which are in turn endosymbionts (or parasites) of the infected plant.

The Ti and Ri plasmids can also be transferred between bacteria using a system (the &quot;tra&quot;, or transfer, operon) that is different and independent of the system used for inter-kingdom transfer (the &quot;vir&quot;, or virulence, operon). Such transfers create virulent strains from previously avirulent strains.

== Genetic engineering applications ==
Conjugation is a convenient means for transferring genetic material to a variety of targets. In laboratories, successful transfers have been reported from bacteria to yeast, plants, mammalian cells, diatoms and isolated mammalian mitochondria. Conjugation has advantages over other forms of genetic transfer including minimal disruption of the target&#x27;s cellular envelope and the ability to transfer relatively large amounts of genetic material (see the above discussion of &quot;E. coli&quot; chromosome transfer). In plant engineering, &quot;Agrobacterium&quot;-like conjugation complements other standard vehicles such as tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). While TMV is capable of infecting many plant families these are primarily herbaceous dicots. &quot;Agrobacterium&quot;-like conjugation is also primarily used for dicots, but monocot recipients are not uncommon.

<doc id="4461" wikidata="Q3644227" url="?curid=4461" title="Galjoen">
<text>The galjoen, black bream, or blackfish (Dichistius capensis) is a species of marine fish found only along the coast of South Africa, Namibia and Angola. Galjoen is the national fish of South Africa.

==Distribution and habitat==

The galjoen is indigenous to the coasts of southern Africa from Angola to South Africa, and is generally found around reefs at shallow depths around , often near the shore.

==Description==
This species can reach in total length and a weight of . The body is compressed, and the fins are well developed, with prominent spines, 10 of them, with between 18 and 23 rays. The anal fin has three spines, and usually 13 or 14 rays, the pelvic fins have 1 spine and 5 rays, and the pectoral fins are typically shorter than the head. The body, fins, and head, with the except of the front of the snout, are covered in scales. The lips are thick, with strong curved incisors at the front of the mouth, with smaller teeth behind the front incisors.
==Ecology==

===Diet===
The species usually feeds on red and coraline seaweed and red bait, small mussels and barnacles found off rocky shores, and appear in particular to be a partial to the white mussels residing in the sandy beaches and inlets of the rocky outcrops along the southern coast.

===Home area===
In 2005, the movements of the species were extensively studied. Some 25,000 galjoen were tagged at four sites in reserves in South Africa and their overall movement was found to remain localised, with some 95% of fish studied seeming to frequent a particular area.

== Conservation status ==
According to the South African Association for Marine Biological Research, the population of the galoen is depleted at less than 20% of its optimal size; the existing stock is maintained due to natural refuges and no-take MPAs.

In the 2018 National Biodiversity Assessment by SANBI, it is listed as Near Threatened. It is listed on the South African Sustainable Seafood Initiative List as a red-listed fish that cannot be sold nor bought; only recreational anglers with a permit may catch a minimum size of 35 cm with a limit of 2 a day.

==Importance to humans==

===Fishing===
It is important to local commercial fisheries and is also popular as a game fish.

===As food===
Due to their abundance in the shores off South Africa, galjoen is common in South African cuisine. A notable dish is the fish sprinkled with pepper and lemon — or alternatively with lemon, mayonnaise, and melted garlic butter — and served with fresh bread and apricot jam.

===As the national fish of South Africa===
Galjoen is the national fish of South Africa. The suggestion to make it the national fish came from Margaret Smith, the wife of ichthyologist J. L. B. Smith, to find a marine equivalent to the springbok.

==Etymology==
The scientific name of &quot;Coracinus capensis&quot; is a reference to its black colour when found in rocky areas, &quot;Coracinus&quot; meaning &quot;raven&quot; or &quot;black coloured&quot;; in sandy areas it gives off a silver-bronze colour.

<text>The blue crane (Grus paradisea), also known as the Stanley crane and the paradise crane, is the national bird of South Africa. The species is listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN.

==Description==
The blue crane is a tall, ground-dwelling bird, but is fairly small by the standards of the crane family. It is tall, with a wingspan of and weighs . Among standard measurements, the wing chord measures , the exposed culmen measures and the tarsus measures . This crane is pale blue-gray in color becoming darker on the upper head, neck and nape. From the crown to the lores, the plumage is distinctly lighter, sometimes whitish. The bill is ochre to greyish, with a pink tinge. The long wingtip feathers which trail to the ground. The primaries are black to slate grey, with dark coverts and blackish on the secondaries. Unlike most cranes, it has a relatively large head and a proportionately thin neck. Juveniles are similar but slightly lighter, with tawny coloration on the head, and no long wing plumes.

==Habitat==
Blue cranes are birds of the dry grassy uplands, usually the pastured grasses of hills, valleys, and plains with a few scattered trees. They prefer areas in the nesting season that have access to both upland and wetland areas, though they feed almost entirely in dry areas. They are altitudinal migrants, generally nesting in the lower grasslands of an elevation of around 1,300 to 2,000 m and moving down to lower altitudes for winter.

==Movements and behaviour==
Of the 15 species of crane, the blue crane has the most restricted distribution of all. Even species with lower population numbers now (such as Siberian or whooping cranes) are found over a considerable range in their migratory movements. The blue crane is migratory, primarily altitudinal, but details are little known.

The blue crane is partially social, less so during the breeding season. There is a strict hierarchy in groups, with the larger adult males being dominant. They overlap in range with three other crane species but interactions with these species and other &quot;large wader&quot; type birds are not known. They are aggressively protective of their nesting sites during the nesting season, even attacking innocent, non-predatory animals such as antelope, cattle, tortoises, plovers and the smallest of birds, such as sparrows. Humans are also attacked if they approach a nest too closely, with the aggressive male having torn clothes and drawn blood in such cases. Threats to their eggs and chicks include large savannah and white-throated monitor lizards, egg-eating snakes, foxes, jackals, birds-of-prey, meerkats, and mongoose.

==Feeding==
Blue cranes feed from the ground and appear to rarely feed near wetland areas. Most of their diet is comprised by grasses and sedges, with many types fed on based on their proximity to the nests. They are also regularly insectivorous, feeding on numerous, sizeable insects such as grasshoppers. Small animals such as crabs, snails, frogs, small lizards and snakes may supplement the diet, with such protein-rich food often being broken down and fed to the young.

==Breeding==

The breeding period is highly seasonal, with eggs being recorded between October and March. Pair-formation amongst groups often starts in October, beginning with both potential parents running in circles with each other. The male then engages in a &quot;dance&quot; flings various objects in the air and then jumps. Eventually, a female from the group and the male appear to &quot;select&quot; each other and both engage in the dance of throwing objects and jumping. After the dance, mating commences in around two weeks.

In a great majority of known nests, two eggs are laid (rarely one or three). Both males and females will incubate, with the male often incubating at night and, during the day, defending the nest territory while the female incubates. The incubation stage lasts around 30 days. The young are able to walk after two days and can swim well shortly thereafter. They are fed primarily by their mothers, who regurgitates food into the mouths. The chicks fledge in the age of 3–5 months. The young continue to be tended to until the next breeding season, at which time they are chased off by their parents.

==Decline==
While it remains common in parts of its historic range, and approx. 26 000 individuals remain, it began a sudden population decline from around 1980 and is now classified as vulnerable.

In the last two decades, the blue crane has largely disappeared from the Eastern Cape, Lesotho, and Eswatini. The population in the northern Free State, Limpopo, Gauteng, Mpumalanga and North West Province has declined by up to 90%. The majority of the remaining population is in eastern and southern South Africa, with a small and separate population in the Etosha Pan of northern Namibia. Occasionally, isolated breeding pairs are found in five neighbouring countries.

The primary causes of the sudden decline of the blue crane are human population growth, the conversion of grasslands into commercial tree plantations, and poisoning: deliberate (to protect crops) or accidental (baits intended for other species, and as a side-effect of crop dusting).

The South African government has stepped up legal protection for the blue crane. Other conservation measures are focusing on research, habitat management, education, and recruiting the help of private landowners.

The blue crane is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

Since October 2021, the Blue Crane has been classified as Moderately Depleted by the IUCN.

==Cultural references==

The blue crane is culturally significant to the Xhosa people, who call it &quot;indwe&quot; (flag). Traditionally, when a man distinguished himself in battle or otherwise, he was often decorated by a chief with blue crane feathers in a ceremony called &quot;ukundzabela&quot;. Men so honoured, who would wear the feathers sticking out of their hair, were known as men of (trouble)—the implication being that if trouble arose, they would reinstate peace and order.

It is also of significance to the Zulu people, whose kings and warriors wore a single or many feathers as a headdress.

Because of the association with warriors and heroism, the Isitwalandwe Medal was created to honour those who had &quot;made an outstanding contribution and sacrifice to the liberation struggle&quot;, that is, those who resisted the apartheid regime in South Africa (1949–1991) in various ways. Isitwalandwe means &quot;the one who wears the plumes of the rare bird&quot;, or blue crane.

The blue crane is also the national bird of South Africa.

<text>Babrak Karmal (Dari/Pashto: ; born Sultan Hussein; 6 January 1929 – 1 or 3 December 1996) was an Afghan communist revolutionary and politician who was the leader of Afghanistan, serving in the post of general secretary of the People&#x27;s Democratic Party of Afghanistan from 1979 to 1986.

Karmal attended Kabul University and developed openly leftist views there, having been introduced to Marxism by Mir Akbar Khyber during his imprisonment for activities deemed too radical by the government. He became a founding member of the People&#x27;s Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) and eventually became the leader of the Parcham faction when the PDPA split in 1967, with their ideological nemesis being the Khalq faction. Karmal was elected to the Lower House after the 1965 parliamentary election, serving in parliament until losing his seat in the 1969 parliamentary election.

Under Karmal&#x27;s leadership, the Parchamite PDPA participated in Mohammad Daoud Khan&#x27;s rise to power in 1973, and his subsequent regime. While relations were good at the beginning, Daoud began a major purge of leftist influence in the mid-1970s. This in turn led to the reformation of the PDPA in 1977, and Karmal played a role in the 1978 Saur Revolution when the PDPA took power. Karmal was appointed Deputy Chairman of the Revolutionary Council, synonymous with vice head of state, in the communist government. The Parchamite faction found itself under significant pressure by the Khalqists soon after taking power. In June 1978, a PDPA Central Committee meeting voted in favor of giving the Khalqist faction exclusive control over PDPA policy. This decision was followed by a failed Parchamite coup, after which Hafizullah Amin, a Khalqist, initiated a purge against the Parchamites. Karmal survived this purge but was exiled to Prague and eventually dismissed from his post. Instead of returning to Kabul, he feared for his life and lived with his family in the forests protected by the Czechoslovak secret police StB. The Afghan secret police KHAD had allegedly sent members to Czechoslovakia to assassinate Karmal. In late 1979 he was brought to Moscow by the KGB and eventually, in December 1979, the Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan (with the consent of Amin&#x27;s government) to stabilize the country. The Soviet troops staged a coup and assassinated Amin, replacing him with Karmal.

Karmal was promoted to Chairman of the Revolutionary Council and Chairman of the Council of Ministers in December 1979. He remained in the latter office until 1981, when he was succeeded by Sultan Ali Keshtmand. Throughout his term, Karmal worked to establish a support base for the PDPA by introducing several reforms. Among these were the &quot;Fundamental Principles of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan&quot;, introducing a general amnesty for those people imprisoned during Nur Mohammad Taraki&#x27;s and Amin&#x27;s rule. He also replaced the red Khalqist flag with a more traditional one. These policies failed to increase the PDPA&#x27;s legitimacy in the eyes of the Afghan people and the Afghan mujahidin rebels, and he was widely seen as a Soviet puppet amongst the populace. These policy failures, and the stalemate that ensued after the Soviet intervention, led the Soviet leadership to become highly critical of Karmal&#x27;s leadership. Under Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet Union deposed Karmal in 1986 and replaced him with Mohammad Najibullah. After losing power, he was exiled to Moscow. It was Anahita Ratebzad who persuaded Najibullah to allow Babrak Karmal to return to Afghanistan in 1991, where Karmal became an associate of Abdul Rashid Dostum and possibly helped remove the Najibullah government from power in 1992. He eventually left Afghanistan again for Moscow. In 1996, Karmal died from liver cancer.

==Early life and career==
Karmal was born Sultan Hussein on 6 January 1929 in Kamari, a village in Kabul. He was the son of Muhammad Hussein, a &quot;dagar jenral&quot; (lieutenant general, three-star rank) in the Afghan Army and former governor of the province of Paktia and Herat provinces, and was the first of six siblings. His family was one of the wealthier families in Kabul. His ethnic background was publicly disputed, with some sources claiming he was Pashtun and that he was Tajik. Throughout his tenure in the Afghan Parliament, Karmal strategically sowed confusion by alternately identifying himself as Pashtun and Tajik, demonstrating a deliberate avoidance of strict ethnic categorization. Karmal&#x27;s ethnicity was a subject of persistent dispute, with conflicting claims made by Pashtun sympathizers and affiliates asserting that he belonged to the &quot;Mullahkhel&quot; Kakar or Khilji tribe of Khost and Paktia as a Pashtun, while Tajik sympathizers and affiliates insisted that he was a Tajik. Although Karmal was only Pashtun Mullahkhel by maternal lineage which itself was Persianised. It is important to note that during and after the Cold War, many English language sources tended to categorize him as a Tajik, often with the intention of discrediting him and providing a rationale for the Russians&#x27; decision to oust him from power for not being Pashtun.

He attended Nejat High School, a German-speaking school, and graduated from it in 1948, and applied to enter the Faculty of Law and Political Science of Kabul University. Karmal&#x27;s application was initially denied admission to Kabul University because of his student political activist and his openly leftist views. He was always a charismatic speaker and became involved in the student union and the Wikh-i-Zalmayan (Awakened Youth Movement), a progressive and leftist organization. He studied at the College of Law and Political Science at Kabul University from 1951 to 1953. In 1953 Karmal was arrested because of his student union activities, but was released three years later in 1956 in an amnesty by Muhammad Daoud Khan. Shortly after, in 1957, Karmal found work as an English and German translator, before quitting and leaving for military training. Karmal graduated from the College of Law and Political Science in 1960, and in 1961, he found work as an employee in the Compilation and Translation Department of the Ministry of Education. From 1961 to 1963 he worked in the Ministry of Planning. When his mother died, Karmal left with his maternal aunt to live somewhere else. His father disowned him because of his leftist views. Karmal was involved in much debauchery, which was controversial in the mostly conservative Afghan society.

===Communist politics===
Imprisoned from 1953 to 1956, Karmal befriended fellow inmate Mir Akbar Khyber, who introduced Karmal to Marxism. Karmal changed his name from Sultan Hussein to Babrak Karmal, which means &quot;Comrade of the Workers&#x27;&quot; in Pashto, to disassociate himself from his bourgeois background. When he was released from prison, he continued his activities in the student union, and began to promote Marxism. Karmal spent the rest of the 1950s and the early 1960s becoming involved with Marxist organizations, of which there were at least four in Afghanistan at the time; two of the four were established by Karmal. When the 1964 Afghan Provisional Constitution, which legalised the establishment of new political entities, was introduced several prominent Marxists agreed to establish a communist political party. The People&#x27;s Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA, the Communist Party) was established in January 1965 in Nur Muhammad Taraki&#x27;s home. Factionalism within the PDPA quickly became a problem; the party split into the Khalq led by Taraki alongside Hafizullah Amin, and the Parcham led by Karmal.

During the 1965 parliamentary election Karmal was one of four PDPA members elected to the lower house of parliament; the three others were Anahita Ratebzad (whom he would later have an affair with according to Vasili Mitrokhin), Nur Ahmed Nur and Fezanul Haq Fezan. No Khalqists were elected; however, Amin was 50 votes short of being elected. The Parchamite victory may be explained by the simple fact that Karmal could contribute financially to the PDPA electoral campaign. Karmal became a leading figure within the student movement in the 1960s, electing Mohammad Hashim Maiwandwal as Prime Minister after a student demonstration (called for by Karmal) concluded with three deaths under the former leadership. In 1966 inside parliament, Karmal was physically assaulted by an Islamist MP, Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi.

In 1967, the PDPA unofficially split into two formal parties, one Khalqist and one Parchamist. The dissolution of the PDPA was initiated by the closing down of the Khalqist newspaper, &quot;Khalq&quot;. Karmal criticised the &quot;Khalq&quot; for being too communist, and believed that its leadership should have hidden its Marxist orientation instead of promoting it. According to the official version of events, the majority of the PDPA Central Committee rejected Karmal&#x27;s criticism. The vote was a close one, and it is reported that Taraki expanded the Central Committee to win the vote; this plan resulted in eight of the new members becoming politically unaligned with and one switching to the Parchamite side. Karmal and half the PDPA Central Committee left the PDPA to establish a Parchamite-led PDPA. Officially the split was caused by ideological differences, but the party may have divided between the different leadership styles and plans of Taraki versus Karmal. Taraki wanted to model the party after Leninist norms while Karmal wanted to establish a democratic front. Other differences were socioeconomic. The majority of Khalqists came from rural areas; hence they were poorer, and were of Pashtun origin. The Parchamites were urban, richer, and spoke Dari more often than not. The Khalqists accused the Parchamites of having a connection with the monarchy, and because of it, referred to the Parchamite PDPA as the &quot;Royal Communist Party&quot;. Both Karmal and Amin retained their seats in the lower house of parliament in the 1969 parliamentary election.

===The Daoud era===

Mohammed Daoud Khan, in collaboration with the Parchamite PDPA and radical military officers, overthrew the monarchy and instituted the Republic of Afghanistan in 1973. After Daoud&#x27;s seizure of power, an American embassy cable stated that the new government had established a Soviet-style Central Committee, in which Karmal and Mir Akbar Khyber were given leading positions. Most ministries were given to Parchamites; Hassan Sharq became Deputy Prime Minister, Major Faiz Mohammad became Minister of Internal Affairs and Niamatullah Pazhwak became Minister of Education. The Parchamites took control over the ministries of finance, agriculture, communications and border affairs. The new government quickly suppressed the opposition, and secured their power base. At first, the National Front government between Daoud and the Parchamites seemed to work. By 1975, Daoud had strengthened his position by enhancing the executive, legislative and judicial powers of the Presidency. To the dismay of the Parchamites, all parties other than the National Revolutionary Party (NRP, established by Daoud) were made illegal.

Shortly after the ban on opposition to the NRP, Daoud began a massive purge of Parchamites in government. Mohammad lost his position as interior minister, Abdul Qadir was demoted, and Karmal was put under government surveillance. To mitigate Daoud&#x27;s suddenly anti-communist directives, the Soviet Union reestablished the PDPA; Taraki was elected its General Secretary and Karmal, Second Secretary. While the Saur Revolution (literally the April Revolution) was planned for August, the assassination of Khyber led to a chain of events which ended with the communists seizing power. Karmal, when taking power in 1979, accused Amin of ordering the assassination of Khyber.

===Taraki–Amin rule===
Taraki was appointed Chairman of the Presidium of the Revolutionary Council and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, retaining his post as PDPA general secretary. Taraki initially formed a government which consisted of both Khalqists and Parchamites; Karmal became Deputy Chairman of the Revolutionary Council, while Amin became Minister of Foreign Affairs and Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers.Mohammad Aslam Watanjar became Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers. The two Parchamites Abdul Qadir and Mohammad Rafi, became Minister of Defence and Minister of Public Works, respectively. The appointment of Amin, Karmal and Watanjar led to splits within the Council of Ministers: the Khalqists answered to Amin; Karmal led the civilian Parchamites; and the military officers (who were Parchamites) were answerable to Watanjar (a Khalqist). The first conflict arose when the Khalqists wanted to give PDPA Central Committee membership to military officers who had participated in the Saur Revolution; Karmal opposed such a move but was overruled. A PDPA Politburo meeting voted in favour of giving Central Committee membership to the officers.

On 27 June, three months after the Saur Revolution, Amin outmaneuvered the Parchamites at a Central Committee meeting, giving the Khalqists exclusive right over formulating and deciding policy. A purge against the Parchamites was initiated by Amin and supported by Taraki on 1 July 1979. Karmal, fearing for his safety, went into hiding in one of his Soviet friends&#x27; homes. Karmal tried to contact Alexander Puzanov, the Soviet ambassador to Afghanistan, to talk about the situation. Puzanov refused, and revealed Karmal&#x27;s location to Amin. The Soviets probably saved Karmal&#x27;s life by sending him to the Socialist Republic of Czechoslovakia. In exile, Karmal established a network with the remaining Parchamites in government. A coup to overthrow Amin was planned for 4 September 1979. Its leading members in Afghanistan were Qadir and the Army Chief of Staff General Shahpur Ahmedzai. The coup was planned for the Festival of Eid, in anticipation of relaxed military vigilance. The conspiracy failed when the Afghan ambassador to India told the Afghan leadership about the plan. Another purge was initiated, and Parchamite ambassadors were recalled. Few returned to Afghanistan; Karmal and Mohammad Najibullah stayed in their respective countries. The Soviets decided that Amin should be removed to make way for a Karmal-Taraki coalition government. However Amin managed to order the arrest and later the murder of Taraki.

Amin was informed of the Soviet decision to intervene in Afghanistan and was initially supportive, but was assassinated. Under the command of the Soviets, Karmal ascended to power. On 27 December 1979, Karmal&#x27;s pre-recorded speech to the Afghan people was broadcast via Radio Kabul from Tashkent in the Uzbek SSR (the radio wavelength was changed to that of Kabul), saying: &quot;Today the torture machine of Amin has been smashed, his accomplices – the primitive executioners, usurpers and murderers of tens of thousand of our fellow countrymen – fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, sons and daughters, children and old people ...&quot; Karmal was not in Kabul when the speech was broadcast; he was in Bagram, protected by the KGB.

That evening Yuri Andropov, the KGB Chairman, congratulated Karmal on his rise to the Chairmanship of the Presidium of the Revolutionary Council, some time before Karmal received an official appointment. Karmal returned to Kabul on 28 December. He travelled alongside a Soviet military column. For the next few days Karmal lived in a villa on the outskirts of Kabul under the protection of the KGB. On 1 January 1980 Leonid Brezhnev, the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and Alexei Kosygin, the Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, congratulated Karmal on his &quot;election&quot; as leader.

==Leadership==

===Domestic policies===
Karmal&#x27;s ascension was quickly troubled as he was effectively installed by the invading Soviet Union, delegitimizing him. Unrest in the country quickly escalated, and in Kabul two major uprisings, on 3 Hoot (22 February) and the months long students&#x27; protests were early signs of trouble. Karmal would also arrest Major Saddiq Alamyar in 1980, the commander of the 444th Commando Battalion, who committed the Kerala massacre while Afghanistan was still under the leadership of the Khalq. Other perpetrators were also arrested, such as other commandos and soldiers in the 11th Division of the Afghan Army. Alamyar remained in jail for a decade, even after Karmal was removed from his post as president.

====The &quot;Fundamental Principles&quot; and amnesty====
When he came to power, Karmal promised an end to executions, the establishment of democratic institutions and free elections, the creation of a constitution, and legalization of alternative political parties. Prisoners incarcerated under the two previous governments would be freed in a general amnesty (which occurred on 6 January). He promised the creation of a coalition government which would not espouse socialism. At the same time, he told the Afghan people that he had negotiated with the Soviet Union to give economic, military and political assistance. The mistrust most Afghans felt towards the government was a problem for Karmal. Many still remembered he had said he would protect private capital in 1978—a promise later proven to be a lie.

Karmal&#x27;s three most important promises were the general amnesty of prisoners, the promulgation of the Fundamental Principles of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and the adoption of a new flag containing the traditional black, red and green (the flag of Taraki and Amin was red). His government granted concessions to religious leaders and the restoration of confiscated property. Some property, which was confiscated during earlier land reforms, was also partially restored. All these measures, with the exception of the general amnesty of prisoners, were introduced gradually. Of 2,700 prisoners, 2,600 were released from prison; 600 of these were Parchamites. The general amnesty was greatly publicized by the government. While the event was hailed with enthusiasm by some, many others greeted the event with disdain, since their loved ones or associates had died during earlier purges. Amin had planned to introduce a general amnesty on 1 January 1980, to coincide with the PDPA&#x27;s sixteenth anniversary.

Work on the Fundamental Principles had started under Amin: it guaranteed democratic rights such as freedom of speech, the right to security and life, the right to peaceful association, the right to demonstrate and the right that &quot;no one would be accused of crime but in accord with the provisions of law&quot; and that the accused had the right to a fair trial. The Fundamental Principles envisaged a democratic state led by the PDPA, the only party then permitted by law. The Revolutionary Council, the organ of supreme power, would convene twice every year. The Revolutionary Council in turn elected a Presidium which would take decisions on behalf of the Revolutionary Council when it was not in session. The Presidium consisted mostly of PDPA Politburo members. The state would safeguard three kinds of property: state, cooperative and private property. The Fundamental Principles said that the state had the right to change the Afghan economy from an economy where man was exploited to an economy where man was free. Another clause stated that the state had the right to take &quot;families, both parents and children, under its supervision.&quot; While it looked democratic at the outset, the Fundamental Principles was based on contradictions.

The Fundamental Principles led to the establishment of two important state organs: the Special Revolutionary Court, a specialized court for crimes against national security and territorial integrity, and the Institute for Legal and Scientific Research and Legislative Affairs, the supreme legislative organ of state, This body could amend and draft laws, and introduce regulations and decrees on behalf of the government. The introduction of more Soviet-style institutions led the Afghan people to distrust the communist government even more.

The Fundamental Principles constitution came into power on 22 April 1980.

====Dividing power: Khalq–Parcham====
With Karmal&#x27;s ascension to power, Parchamites began to &quot;settle old scores&quot;. Revolutionary Troikas were created to arrest, sentence and execute people. Amin&#x27;s guard were the first victims of the terror which ensued. Those commanders who had stayed loyal to Amin were arrested, filling the prisons. The Soviets protested, and Karmal replied, &quot;As long as you keep my hands bound and do not let me deal with the Khalq faction there will be no unity in the PDPA and the government cannot become strong ... They tortured and killed us. They still hate us! They are the enemies of the party ...&quot; Amin&#x27;s daughter, along with her baby, was imprisoned for twelve years, until Mohammad Najibullah, then leader of the PDPA, released her. When Karmal took power, leading posts in the Party and Government bureaucracy were taken over by Parchamites. The Khalq faction was removed from power, and only technocrats, opportunists and individuals which the Soviets trusted would be appointed to the higher echelons of government. Khalqists remained in control of the Ministry of Interior, but Parchamites were given control over KHAD and the secret police. The Parchamites and the Khalqists controlled an equal share of the military. Two out of Karmal&#x27;s three Council of Ministers deputy chairmen were Khalqists. Khalqists controlled the Ministry of Communications and the interior ministry. Parchamites, on the other hand, controlled the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defence. In addition to the changes in government, the Parchamites held clear majority in the PDPA Central Committee. Only one Khalqi, Saleh Mohammad Zeary, was a member of the PDPA Secretariat during Karmal&#x27;s rule.

Over 14 and 15 March 1982 the PDPA held a party &quot;conference&quot; at the Kabul Polytechnic Institute instead of a party &quot;congress&quot;, since a party congress would have given the Khalq faction a majority and could have led to a Khalqist takeover of the PDPA. The rules of holding a party conference were different, and the Parchamites had a three-fifths majority. This infuriated several Khalqists; the threat of expulsion did not lessen their anger. The conference was not successful, but it was portrayed as such by the official media. The conference broke up after one and a half days of a 3-day long program, because of the inter-party struggle for power between the Khalqists and the Parchamites. A &quot;program of action&quot; was introduced, and party rules were given minor changes. As an explanation of the low party membership, the official media also made it seem hard to become a member of the party.

====PDPA base====

When Karmal took power, he began expanding the support base of the PDPA. Karmal tried to persuade certain groups, which had been referred to class enemies of the revolution during Taraki and Amin&#x27;s rule, to support the PDPA. Karmal appointed several non-communists to top positions. Between March and May 1980, 78 out of the 191 people appointed to government posts were not members of the PDPA. Karmal reintroduced the old Afghan custom of having an Islamic invocation every time the government issued a proclamation. In his first live speech to the Afghan people, Karmal called for the establishment of the National Fatherland Front (NFF); the NFF&#x27;s founding congress was held in June 1981. Unfortunately for Karmal, his policies did not lead to a notable increase in support for his regime, and it did not help Karmal that most Afghans saw the Soviet intervention as an invasion.

By 1981, the government gave up on political solutions to the conflict. At the fifth PDPA Central Committee plenum in June, Karmal resigned from his Council of Ministers chairmanship and was replaced by Sultan Ali Keshtmand, while Nur Ahmad Nur was given a bigger role in the Revolutionary Council. This was seen as &quot;base broadening&quot;. The previous weight given to non-PDPA members in top positions ceased to be an important matter in the media by June 1981. This was significant, considering that up to five members of the Revolutionary Council were non-PDPA members. By the end of 1981, the previous contenders, who had been heavily presented in the media, were all gone; two were given ambassadorships, two ceased to be active in politics, and one continued as an advisor to the government. The other three changed sides, and began to work for the opposition.

The national policy of reconciliation continued: in January 1984 the land reform introduced by Taraki and Amin was drastically modified, the limits of landholdings were increased to win the support of middle class peasants, the literacy programme was continued, and concessions to women were made. In 1985 the Loya Jirga was reconvened. The 1985 Loya Jirga was followed by a tribal jirga in September. In 1986 Abdul Rahim Hatef, a non-PDPA member, was elected to the NFF chairmanship. During the 1985–86 elections it was said that 60 percent of the elected officials were non-PDPA members. By the end of Karmal&#x27;s rule, several non-PDPA members had high-level government positions.

====Civil war and military====
In March 1979, the military budget was 6.4 million US$, which was 8.3 percent of the government budget, but only 2.2 of gross national product. After the Soviet intervention, the defence budget increased to 208 million US$ in 1980, and 325 million US$ by 1981. In 1982 it was reported that the government spent around 22 percent of total expenditure.

When the political solution failed (see &quot;PDPA base&quot; section), the Afghan government and the Soviet military decided to solve the conflict militarily. The change from a political to a military solution did not come suddenly. It began in January 1981, as Karmal doubled wages for military personnel, issued several promotions, and decorated one general and thirteen colonels. The draft age was lowered, the obligatory length of arms duty was extended and the age for reservists was increased to thirty-five years of age. In June 1981, Assadullah Sarwari lost his seat in the PDPA Politburo, replaced by Mohammad Aslam Watanjar, a former tank commander and Minister of Communications, Major General Mohammad Rafi was made Minister of Defence and Mohammad Najibullah appointed KHAD Chairman.

These measures were introduced due to the collapse of the army during the Soviet intervention. Before the intervention the army could field 100,000 troops, after the intervention only 25,000. Desertions were pandemic, and the recruitment campaigns for young people often drove them to the opposition. To better organize the military, seven military zones were established, each with its own Defence Council. The Defence Councils were established at the national, provincial and district level to empower the local PDPA. It is estimated that the Afghan government spent as much as 40 percent of government revenue on defense.

Karmal refused to recognize the rebels as genuine, saying in an interview:
====Economy====

During the civil war and the ensuing Soviet–Afghan War, most of the country&#x27;s infrastructure was destroyed. Normal patterns of economic activity were disrupted. The Gross national product (GNP) fell substantially during Karmal&#x27;s rule because of the conflict; trade and transport was disrupted with loss of labor and capital. In 1981 the Afghan GDP stood at 154.3 billion Afghan afghanis, a drop from 159.7 billion in 1978. GNP per capita decreased from 7,370 in 1978 to 6,852 in 1981. The dominant form of economic activity was in the agricultural sector. Agriculture accounted for 63 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1981; 56 percent of the labor force was working in agriculture in 1982. Industry accounted for 21 percent of GDP in 1982, and employed 10 percent of the labor force. All industrial enterprises were government-owned. The service sector, the smallest of the three, accounted for 10 percent of GDP in 1981, and employed an estimated one-third of the labour force. The balance of payments, which had grown in the pre-communist administration of Muhammad Daoud Khan, decreased, turning negative by 1982 at 70.3 million $US. The only economic activity which grew substantially during Karmal&#x27;s rule was export and import.

===Foreign policy===
Karmal observed in early 1983 that without Soviet intervention, &quot;It is unknown what the destiny of the Afghan Revolution would be ... We are realists and we clearly realize that in store for us yet lie trials and deprivations, losses and difficulties.&quot; Two weeks before this statement Sultan Ali Keshtmand, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, lamented the fact that half the schools and three-quarters of communications had been destroyed since 1979. The Soviet Union rejected several Western-made peace plans, such as the Carrington Plan, since they did not take into consideration the PDPA government. Most Western peace plans had been made in collaboration with the Afghan opposition forces. At the 26th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) Leonid Brezhnev, the General Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, stated;
The stance of the Pakistani government was clear, demanding complete Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan and the establishment of a non-PDPA government. Karmal, summarizing his discussions with Iran and Pakistan, said &quot;Iran and Pakistan have so far not opted for concrete and constructive positions.&quot; During Karmal&#x27;s rule Afghan–Pakistani relations remained hostile; the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan was the catalyst for the hostile relationship. The increasing numbers of Afghan refugees in Pakistan challenged the PDPA&#x27;s legitimacy to rule.

The Soviet Union threatened in 1985 that it would support the Baloch separatist movement in Pakistan if the Pakistani government continued to aid the Afghan mujahideen. Karmal, problematically for the Soviets, did not want a Soviet withdrawal, and he hampered attempts to improve relations with Pakistan since the Pakistani government had refused to recognise the PDPA government.

===Public image===
Because Karmal was put into power without a formal ceremony as in Afghan tradition, he was seen as an illegitimate leader in many eyes of his people. A poor performance in foreign interviews also did not help his public image where he was noted to speak like an &quot;exhibitionist&quot; rather than a statesman. Karmal was widely viewed as a puppet leader of the Soviet Union by Afghans and the Western press.

Despite his position, Karmal was apparently not permitted to make key decisions as he was following advice from Soviet advisers. The Soviet control of the Afghan state was apparently so much that Karmal himself admitted to a friend of his unfree life, telling him: “The Soviet comrades love me boundlessly, and for the sake of my personal safety, they don’t obey even my own orders.”

===Fall from power and succession===
Mikhail Gorbachev, then General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, said, &quot;The main reason that there has been no national consolidation so far is that Comrade Karmal is hoping to continue sitting in Kabul with our help.&quot; Karmal&#x27;s position became less secure when the Soviet leadership began blaming him for the failures in Afghanistan. Gorbachev, worried over the situation, told the Soviet Politburo &quot;If we don&#x27;t change approaches [to evacuate Afghanistan], we will be fighting there for another 20 or 30 years.&quot; It is not clear when the Soviet leadership began to campaign for Karmal&#x27;s dismissal, but Andrei Gromyko discussed the possibility of Karmal&#x27;s resignation with Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, the Secretary-General of the United Nations in 1982. While it was Gorbachev who would dismiss Karmal, there may have been a consensus within the Soviet leadership in 1983 that Karmal should resign. Gorbachev&#x27;s own plan was to replace Karmal with Mohammad Najibullah, who had joined the PDPA at its creation. Najibullah was thought highly of by Yuri Andropov, Boris Ponomarev and Dmitriy Ustinov, and negotiations for his succession may have started in 1983. Najibullah was not the Soviet leadership&#x27;s only choice for Karmal&#x27;s succession; a GRU report noted that the majority of the PDPA leadership would support Assadullah Sarwari&#x27;s ascension to leadership. According to the GRU, Sarwari was a better candidate as he could balance between the Pashtuns, Tajiks and Uzbeks; Najibullah was a Pashtun nationalist. Another viable candidate was Abdul Qadir, who had been a participant in the Saur Revolution.

Najibullah was appointed to the PDPA Secretariat in November 1985. During Karmal&#x27;s March 1986 visit to the Soviet Union, the Soviets tried to persuade Karmal that he was too ill to govern, and that he should resign. This backfired, as a Soviet doctor attending to Karmal told him he was in good health. Karmal asked to return home to Kabul, and said that he understood and would listen to the Soviet recommendations. Before leaving, Karmal promised he would step down as PDPA General Secretary. The Soviets did not trust him and sent Vladimir Kryuchkov, the head of intelligence (FCD) in the KGB, into Afghanistan. At a meeting in Kabul, Karmal confessed his undying love for the Soviet Union, comparing his ardor to his Muslim faith. Kryuchkov, concluding that he could not persuade Karmal to resign, left the meeting. After Kryuchkov left the room, the Afghan defence minister and the state security minister visited Karmal&#x27;s office, telling him that he had to resign from one of his posts. Understanding that his Soviet support had been eliminated, Karmal resigned from the office of the General Secretary at the 18th PDPA Central Committee plenum. He was succeeded in his post by Najibullah.

Karmal still had support within the party, and used his base to curb Najibullah&#x27;s powers. He began spreading rumors that he would be reappointed General Secretary. Najibullah&#x27;s power base was in the KHAD, the Afghan equivalent to the KGB, and not the party. Considering the fact that the Soviet Union had supported Karmal for over six years, the Soviet leadership wanted to ease him out of power gradually. Yuli Vorontsov, the Soviet ambassador to Afghanistan, told Najibullah to begin undermining Karmal&#x27;s power slowly. Najibullah complained to the Soviet leadership that Karmal used most of his spare time looking for errors and &quot;speaking against the National Reconciliation programme&quot;. At a meeting of the Soviet Politburo on 13 November 1986 it was decided that Najibullah should remove Karmal; this motion was supported by Gromyko, Vorontsov, Eduard Shevardnadze, Anatoly Dobrynin and Viktor Chebrikov. A PDPA meeting in November relieved Karmal of his Revolutionary Council chairmanship, and exiled him to Moscow where he was given a state-owned apartment and a dacha. Karmal was succeeded as Revolutionary Council chairman by Haji Mohammad Tsamkani, who was not a member of the PDPA.

==Later life and death==
Many years after the end of his leadership, he denounced the Saur Revolution of 1978 in which he took part, taking aim at the Khalq governments of Taraki and Amin. He told a Soviet reporter:

It was the greatest crime against the people of Afghanistan. Parcham&#x27;s leaders were against armed actions because the country was not ready for a revolution... I knew that people would not support us if we decided to keep power without such support.

Karmal was invited back to Kabul by Najibullah, and &quot;for equally obscure reasons Karmal accepted&quot;, returning on 20 June 1991 (this could have been on the recommendation of Anahita Ratebzad who was very close to Karmal and also respected by Najibullah). If Najibullah&#x27;s plan was to strengthen his position within the Watan Party (the renamed PDPA) by appeasing the pro-Karmal Parchamites, he failed – Karmal&#x27;s apartment became a center for opposition to Najibullah&#x27;s government. When Najibullah was toppled in 1992, Karmal became the most powerful politician in Kabul through leadership of the Parcham. However, his negotiations with the rebels collapsed quickly, and on 16 April 1992 the rebels, led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, took Kabul. After the fall of Najibullah&#x27;s government, Karmal was based in Hairatan. There, it is alleged, Karmal used most of his time either trying to establish a new party, or advising people to join the secular National Islamic Movement (&quot;Junbish-i-Milli&quot;). Abdul Rashid Dostum, the leader of Junbish-i-Milli, was a supporter of Karmal during his rule. It is unknown how much control Karmal had over Dostum, but there is little evidence that Karmal was in any commanding position. Karmal&#x27;s influence over Dostum appeared indirect – some of his former associates supported Dostum. Those who spoke with Karmal during this period noted his lack of interest in politics. In June 1992 it was reported that he had died in a plane crash along with Dostum, although these reports later proved to be false.

In early December 1996, Karmal died in Moscow&#x27;s Central Clinical Hospital from liver cancer. The date of his death was reported by some sources as 1 December and by others as 3 December. The Taliban summed up his rule as follows:
[he] committed all kinds of crimes during his illegitimate rule ... God inflicted on him various kinds of hardship and pain. Eventually he died of cancer in a hospital belonging to his paymasters, the Russians.

<text>Buddhist philosophy is the ancient Indian philosophical system that developed within the religio-philosophical tradition of Buddhism. It comprises all the philosophical investigations and systems of rational inquiry that developed among various schools of Buddhism in ancient India following the &quot;parinirvāṇa&quot; of Gautama Buddha (c. 5th century BCE), as well as the further developments which followed the spread of Buddhism throughout Asia.

Buddhism combines both philosophical reasoning and the practice of meditation. The Buddhist religion presents a multitude of Buddhist paths to liberation; with the expansion of early Buddhism from ancient India to Sri Lanka and subsequently to East Asia and Southeast Asia, Buddhist thinkers have covered topics as varied as cosmology, ethics, epistemology, logic, metaphysics, ontology, phenomenology, the philosophy of mind, the philosophy of time, and soteriology in their analysis of these paths.

Pre-sectarian Buddhism was based on empirical evidence gained by the sense organs (including the mind), and the Buddha seems to have retained a skeptical distance from certain metaphysical questions, refusing to answer them because they were not conducive to liberation but led instead to further speculation. However he also affirmed theories with metaphysical implications, such as dependent arising, karma, and rebirth.

Particular points of Buddhist philosophy have often been the subject of disputes between different schools of Buddhism, as well as between representative thinkers of Buddhist schools and Hindu or Jaina philosophers. These elaborations and disputes gave rise to various early Buddhist schools of Abhidharma, the Mahāyāna movement, and scholastic traditions such as Prajñāpāramitā, Sarvāstivāda, Mādhyamaka, Sautrāntika, Vaibhāṣika, Buddha-nature, Yogācāra, and more. One recurrent theme in Buddhist philosophy has been the desire to find a Middle Way between philosophical views seen as extreme.

==Historical phases of Buddhist philosophy==

Edward Conze splits the development of Indian Buddhist philosophy into three phases:

# The phase of the pre-sectarian Buddhist doctrines derived from oral traditions that originated during the life of Gautama Buddha, and are common to all later schools of Buddhism.
# The second phase concerns non-Mahāyāna &quot;scholastic&quot; Buddhism, as evident in the Abhidharma texts beginning in the 3rd century BCE, that feature scholastic reworking and schematic classification of material in the early Buddhist texts. The Abhidhamma philosophy of the Theravāda school belongs to this phase.
# The third phase concerns Mahāyāna Buddhism, beginning in the late first century CE. This movement emphasizes the path of a bodhisattva and includes various schools of thought, such as Prajñāpāramitā, Mādhyamaka, Sautrāntika, Buddha-nature, and Yogācāra.

Various elements of these three phases are incorporated and/or further developed in the philosophy and worldview of the various sects of Buddhism that then emerged.

==Philosophical orientation==

Philosophy in ancient India was aimed mainly at spiritual liberation and had soteriological goals. In his study of the Mādhyamaka and Sautrāntika schools of Buddhist philosophy in ancient India, Peter Deller Santina writes:

For the Indian Buddhist philosophers, the teachings of Gautama Buddha were not meant to be taken on faith alone, but to be confirmed by logical analysis and inquiry (&quot;pramāṇa&quot;) of the world. The early Buddhist texts mention that a person becomes a follower of the Buddha&#x27;s teachings after having pondered them over with wisdom and the gradual training also requires that a disciple &quot;investigate&quot; (&quot;upaparikkhati&quot;) and &quot;scrutinize&quot; (&quot;tuleti&quot;) the teachings. The Buddha also expected his disciples to approach him as a teacher in a critical fashion and scrutinize his actions and words, as shown in the &quot;Vīmaṃsaka Sutta&quot;.

Some Buddhist thinkers even argued that rational reflection and philosophical analysis was a central practice which was necessary for the attainment of insight in meditation. Thus, Mahayana philosophers like Prajñakaragupta argue that one is not a yogi &quot;merely because of meditation&quot;, rather, one must meditate, listen to the teachings and understand them by &quot;reflecting through rational inquiry&quot; (yukti-cintāmaya). Only through this method which combined rational reflection and meditation will the wisdom that leads to enlightenment arise.

==The Buddha and early Buddhism==

===The Buddha===


Scholarly opinion varies as to whether Gautama Buddha himself was engaged in philosophical inquiry. Siddartha Gautama (c. 5th century BCE) was a north Indian &quot;Śramaṇa&quot; (wandering ascetic), whose teachings are preserved in the Pāli Nikayas and in the Āgamas as well as in other surviving fragmentary textual collections, collectively known as the early Buddhist texts. Dating these texts is difficult, and there is disagreement on how much of this material goes back to a single religious founder. While the focus of the Buddha&#x27;s teachings is about attaining the highest good of &quot;nirvāṇa&quot;, they also contain an analysis of the source of human suffering (&quot;duḥkha&quot;), the nature of personal identity (&quot;ātman&quot;), and the process of acquiring knowledge (&quot;prajña&quot;) about the world.

===The Middle Way===
The Buddha defined his teaching as &quot;the Middle Way&quot; (Pāli: &quot;majjhimāpaṭipadā&quot;). In the &quot;Dharmacakrapravartana Sūtra&quot;, this is used to refer to the fact that his teachings steer a middle course between the extremes of asceticism and bodily denial (as practiced by the Jains and other Indian ascetic groups) and sensual hedonism or indulgence. Many &quot;Śramaṇa&quot; ascetics of the Buddha&#x27;s time placed much emphasis on a denial of the body, using practices such as fasting, to liberate the mind from the body. Gautama Buddha, however, realized that the mind was embodied and causally dependent on the body, and therefore that a malnourished body did not allow the mind to be trained and developed. Thus, Buddhism&#x27;s main concern is not with luxury or poverty, but instead with the human response to circumstances.

Another related teaching of the historical Buddha is &quot;the teaching through the middle&quot; (&quot;majjhena dhammaṃ desana&quot;), which claims to be a metaphysical middle path between the extremes of eternalism and annihilationism, as well as the extremes of existence and non-existence. This idea would become central to later Buddhist metaphysics, as all Buddhist philosophies would claim to steer a metaphysical middle course.

===Basic teachings===

Apart from the middle way, certain basic teachings appear in many places throughout these early Buddhist texts, so older studies by various scholars conclude that the Buddha must at least have taught some of these key teachings:
* The Four Noble Truths, which provide an analysis of the cause of suffering (&quot;duḥkha&quot;)
* The Noble Eightfold Path, which illustrate the path to spiritual liberation (&quot;mokṣa&quot;)
* The four &quot;dhyānas&quot; (meditations)
* The three marks of existence, three characteristics which apply to all phenomena and which are: suffering (&quot;duḥkha&quot;), impermanence (&quot;anicca&quot;), and non-self (&quot;anattā&quot;)
* The five aggregates of clinging (&quot;skandhā&quot;), which provide an analysis of personal identity and physical existence
* Dependent origination (&quot;pratītyasamutpāda&quot;), a complex doctrine which analyzes the how living beings come to be and how they are conditioned by various psycho-physical processes
* &quot;Karma&quot; and rebirth, actions which lead to a new existence after death, in an endless cycle of birth, death, and rebirth (&quot;saṃsāra&quot;)
* &quot;Nirvāṇa&quot;, the ultimate soteriological goal which leads to the cessation of all suffering

According to N. Ross Reat, all of these doctrines are shared by the Pāli Canon of Theravāda Buddhism and the &quot;Śālistamba Sūtra&quot; belonging to the Mahāsāṃghika school. A recent study by Bhikkhu Analayo concludes that the Theravādin &quot;Majjhima Nikāya&quot; and the Sarvāstivādin &quot;Madhyama Āgama&quot; contain mostly the same major Buddhist doctrines. Richard G. Salomon, in his study of the Gandhāran Buddhist texts (which are the earliest manuscripts containing discourses attributed to Gautama Buddha), has confirmed that their teachings are &quot;consistent with non-Mahayana Buddhism, which survives today in the Theravada school of Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia, but which in ancient times was represented by eighteen separate schools.&quot;

However, some scholars such as Schmithausen, Vetter, and Bronkhorst argue that critical analysis reveals discrepancies among these various doctrines. They present alternative possibilities for what was taught in earliest Buddhism and question the authenticity of certain teachings and doctrines. For example, some scholars think that the doctrine of &quot;karma&quot; was not central to the teachings of the historical Buddha, while others disagree with this position. Likewise, there is scholarly disagreement on whether insight into the true nature of reality (&quot;prajña&quot;) was seen as liberating in earliest Buddhism or whether it was a later addition. according to Vetter and Bronkhorst, &quot;dhyāna&quot; constituted the original &quot;liberating practice&quot;, while discriminating insight into transiency as a separate path to liberation was a later development. Scholars such as Bronkhorst and Carol Anderson also think that the Four Noble Truths may not have been formulated in earliest Buddhism but as Anderson writes &quot;emerged as a central teaching in a slightly later period that still preceded the final redactions of the various Buddhist canons.&quot;

According to some scholars, the philosophical outlook of earliest Buddhism was primarily negative, in the sense that it focused on what doctrines to &quot;reject&quot; and let go of more than on what doctrines to &quot;accept&quot;. Only knowledge that is useful in attaining liberation is valued. According to this theory, the cycle of philosophical upheavals that in part drove the diversification of Buddhism into its many schools and sects only began once Buddhists began attempting to make explicit the implicit philosophy of the Buddha and the early texts.

===The Four Noble Truths and dependent causation===

The Four Noble Truths or &quot;Truths of the Noble One&quot; are a central feature to the teachings of the historical Buddha and are put forth in the &quot;Dharmacakrapravartana Sūtra&quot;. The first truth of &quot;duḥkha&quot;, often translated as &quot;suffering&quot;, is the inherent and eternal unsatisfactoriness of life. This unpleasantness is said to be not just physical pain and psychological distress, but also a kind of existential unease caused by the inevitable facts of our mortality and ultimately by the impermanence of all beings and phenomena.

Suffering also arises because of contact with unpleasant events, and due to not getting what one desires. The second truth is that this unease arises out of conditions, mainly craving (&quot;taṇhā&quot;) and ignorance (&quot;avidyā&quot;). The third truth is then the fact that whenever sentient beings let go of craving and remove ignorance through insight and knowledge, suffering ceases (&quot;nirodhā&quot;). The fourth truth is the Noble Eightfold Path, which consists of eight practices that end suffering. They are: right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right &quot;samādhi&quot; (concentration, mental unification, meditation). The highest good and ultimate goal taught by the historical Buddha, which is the attainment of &quot;nirvāṇa&quot;, literally means &quot;extinguishing&quot; and signified &quot;the complete extinguishing of greed, hatred, and delusion (i.e. ignorance), the forces which power &quot;saṃsāra&quot;&quot;.

&quot;Nirvāṇa&quot; also means that after an enlightened being&#x27;s death, there is no further rebirth. In earliest Buddhism, the concept of dependent origination (&quot;pratītya-samutpāda&quot;) was most likely limited to processes of mental conditioning and not to all physical phenomena. Gautama Buddha understood the world in procedural terms, not in terms of things or substances. His theory posits a flux of events arising under certain conditions which are interconnected and dependent, such that the processes in question at no time are considered to be static or independent. Craving (&quot;taṇhā&quot;), for example, is always dependent on, and caused by sensations gained by the sense organs (&quot;āyatana&quot;). Sensations are always dependent on contact with our surroundings. Buddha&#x27;s causal theory is simply descriptive: &quot;This existing, that exists; this arising, that arises; this not existing, that does not exist; this ceasing, that ceases.&quot; This understanding of causation as &quot;impersonal lawlike causal ordering&quot; is important because it shows how the processes that give rise to suffering work, and also how they can be reversed.

The removal of suffering that stemmed from ignorance (&quot;avidyā&quot;), then, requires a deep understanding of the nature of reality (&quot;prajña&quot;). While philosophical analysis of arguments and concepts is clearly necessary to develop this understanding, it is not enough to remove our unskillful mental habits and deeply ingrained prejudices, which require meditation, paired with understanding. According to the Buddha&#x27;s teachings as recorded in the Gandhāran Buddhist texts, we need to train the mind in meditation to be able to truly comprehend the nature of reality, which is said to have the Three marks of existence: suffering, impermanence, and non-self (&quot;anātman&quot;). Understanding and meditation are said to work together to clearly see (&quot;vipassanā&quot;) the nature of human experience and this is said to lead to liberation.

===Non-self===


Gautama Buddha argued that compounded entities and sentient beings lacked essence, correspondingly the self is without essence (&quot;anātman&quot;). This means there is no part of a person which is unchanging and essential for continuity, and it means that there is no individual &quot;part of the person that accounts for the identity of that person over time&quot;. This is in opposition to the Upanishadic concept of an unchanging ultimate self (&quot;ātman&quot;) and any view of an eternal soul. The Buddha held that attachment to the appearance of a permanent self in this world of change is the cause of suffering (&quot;duḥkha&quot;), and the main obstacle to the attainment of spiritual liberation (&quot;mokṣa&quot;).

The most widely used argument that the Buddha employed against the idea of an unchanging ego is an empiricist one, based on the observation of the five aggregates of existence (&quot;skandhā&quot;) that constitute a sentient being, and the fact that these are always changing. This argument can be put in this way:

# All psycho-physical processes (&quot;skandhā&quot;) are impermanent.
# If there were a self it would be permanent.
::IP [There is no more to the person than the five aggregates of existence.] 
::∴ There is no self.

This argument requires the implied premise that the five aggregates are an exhaustive account of what makes up a person, or else the self could exist outside of these aggregates. This premise is affirmed in other Buddhist texts, such as &quot;Saṃyutta Nikāya&quot; 22.47, which states: &quot;whatever ascetics and brahmins regard various kinds of things as self, all regard the five grasping aggregates, or one of them.&quot;

This argument is famously expounded in the &quot;Anātmalakṣaṇa Sūtra&quot;. According to this text, the apparently fixed self is merely the result of identification with the temporary aggregates of existence (&quot;skandhā&quot;), the changing processes making up an individual human being. In this view, a &#x27;person&#x27; is only a convenient nominal designation on a certain grouping of processes and characteristics, and an &#x27;individual&#x27; is a conceptual construction overlaid upon a stream of experiences, just like a chariot is merely a conventional designation for the parts of a chariot and how they are put together. The foundation of this argument is purely empiricist, for it is based on the fact that all we observe is subject to change, especially everything observed when looking inwardly in meditation.

Another argument supporting the doctrine of non-self, the &quot;argument from lack of control&quot;, is based on the fact that we often seek to change certain parts of ourselves, that the &quot;executive function&quot; of the mind is that which finds certain things unsatisfactory and attempts to alter them. Furthermore, it is also based on the &quot;anti-reflexivity principle&quot; of Indian philosophy, which states an entity cannot operate on or control itself (a knife can cut other things but not itself, a finger can point at other things but not at itself, etc.). This means then, that the self could never desire to change itself and could not do so; another reason for this is that, besides Buddhism, in the orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy the unchanging ultimate self (&quot;ātman&quot;) is perfectly blissful and does not suffer. The historical Buddha used this idea to attack the concept of self. This argument could be structured thus:

# If the self existed it would be the part of the person that performs the executive function, the &quot;controller.&quot;
# The self could never desire that it be changed (anti-reflexivity principle).
# Each of the five kinds of psycho-physical processes (&quot;skandhā&quot;) is such that one can desire that it be changed.
::IP [There is no more to the person than the five aggregates of existence.]
::∴ There is no self.

This argument then denies that there is one permanent &quot;controller&quot; in the person. Instead, it views the person as a set of constantly changing processes which include volitional events seeking change and an awareness of that desire for change. According to Mark Siderits:

As noted by K.R. Norman and Richard Gombrich, the Buddha extended his non-self critique to the Brahmanical belief expounded in the &quot;Brihadaranyaka Upanishad&quot; that the unchanging ultimate self (&quot;ātman&quot;) was indeed the whole world, or identical with Brahman. This concept is illustrated in the &quot;Alagaddupama Sūtra&quot;, where the Buddha argues that an individual cannot experience the suffering of the entire world. He used the example of someone carrying off and burning grass and sticks from the Jeta grove and how a monk would not sense or consider themselves harmed by that action. In this example, the Buddha is arguing that we do not have direct experience of the entire world, and hence the self cannot be the whole world. In this Buddhist text, as well as in the &quot;Soattā Sūtra&quot;, the Buddha outlines six wrong views about self:

Furthermore, Gautama Buddha argued that the world can be observed to be a cause of suffering (Brahman was held to be ultimately blissful in the orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy) and that since we cannot control the world as we wish, the world cannot be the self. The idea that &quot;this cosmos is the self&quot; is one of the six wrong views rejected by the historical Buddha, along with the related monistic Hindu theology which held that &quot;everything is a Oneness&quot; (SN 12.48 &quot;Lokayatika Sutta&quot;). The historical Buddha also held that understanding and seeing the truth of non-self led to un-attachment, and hence to the cessation of suffering, while ignorance (&quot;avidyā&quot;) about the true nature of personality (&quot;prajña&quot;) led to further suffering and attachment.

===Epistemology===
All schools of Indian philosophy recognize various sets of valid justifications for knowledge (&quot;pramāṇa&quot;) and many see the Vedas as providing access to truth. The historical Buddha denied the authority of the Vedas, though, like his contemporaries, he affirmed the soteriological importance of holding the right view; that is, having a proper understanding of reality. However, this understanding was not conceived primarily as metaphysical and cosmological knowledge, but as a piece of knowledge into the arising and cessation of suffering in human experience. Therefore, the Buddha&#x27;s epistemic project is different from that of modern philosophy; it is primarily a solution to the fundamental human spiritual/existential problem.

Gautama Buddha&#x27;s logico-epistemology has been compared to empiricism, in the sense that it was based on the experience of the world through the senses. The Buddha taught that empirical observation through the six sense fields (&quot;āyatanā&quot;) was the proper way of verifying any knowledge claims. Some Buddhist texts go further, stating that &quot;the All&quot;, or everything that exists (&quot;sabbam&quot;), are these six sense spheres (SN 35.23, &quot;Sabba Sutta&quot;) and that anyone who attempts to describe another &quot;All&quot; will be unable to do so because &quot;it lies beyond range&quot;. This text seems to indicate that for the Buddha, things in themselves or noumena are beyond our epistemological reach (&quot;avisaya&quot;).

Furthermore, in the &quot;Kālāma Sutta&quot; the Buddha tells a group of confused villagers that the only proper reason for one&#x27;s beliefs is verification in one&#x27;s own personal experience (and the experience of the wise) and denies any verification which stems from a personal authority, sacred tradition (&quot;anussava&quot;), or any kind of rationalism which constructs metaphysical theories (&quot;takka&quot;). In the &quot;Tevijja Sutta&quot; (DN 13), the Buddha rejects the personal authority of Brahmins because none of them can prove they have had personal experience of Brahman, nor could any of them prove its existence. The Buddha also stressed that experience is the only criterion for verification of the truth in this passage from the &quot;Majjhima Nikāya&quot; (MN.I.265):

::&quot;Monks, do you only speak that which is known by yourselves seen by yourselves, found by yourselves?&quot; 
::&quot;Yes, we do, sir.&quot; 
::&quot;Good, monks, That is how you have been instructed by me in this timeless doctrine which can be realized and verified, that leads to the goal and can be understood by those who are intelligent.&quot;

Furthermore, the Buddha&#x27;s standard for personal verification was a pragmatic and salvific one, for the Buddha a belief counts as truth only if it leads to successful Buddhist practice (and hence, to the destruction of craving). In the &quot;Discourse to Prince Abhaya&quot; (MN.I.392–4) the Buddha states this pragmatic maxim by saying that a belief should only be accepted if it leads to wholesome consequences. This tendency of the Buddha to see what is true as what was useful or &quot;what works&quot; has been called by Western scholars such as Mrs Rhys Davids and Vallée-Poussin a form of pragmatism. However, K. N. Jayatilleke argues the Buddha&#x27;s epistemology can also be taken to be a form of correspondence theory (as per the &quot;Apannaka Sutta&quot;) with elements of coherentism, and that for the Buddha it is causally impossible for something which is false to lead to cessation of suffering and evil.

Gautama Buddha discouraged his disciples and early followers of Buddhism from indulging in intellectual disputation for its own sake, which is fruitless, and distracts one from the ultimate goals of awakening (&quot;bodhi&quot;) and liberation (&quot;mokṣa&quot;). Only philosophy and discussion which has pragmatic value for liberation from suffering is seen as important. According to the Pāli Canon, during his lifetime the Buddha remained silent when asked several metaphysical questions which he regarded as the basis for &quot;unwise reflection&quot;. These &quot;unanswered questions&quot; (&quot;avyākṛta&quot;) regarded issues such as whether the universe is eternal or non-eternal (or whether it is finite or infinite), the unity or separation of the body and the self (&quot;ātman&quot;), the complete inexistence of a person after death and &quot;nirvāṇa&quot;, and others. In the &quot;Aggi-Vacchagotta Sutta&quot;, the historical Buddha stated that thinking about these imponderable issues led to &quot;a thicket of views, a wilderness of views, a contortion of views, a writhing of views, a fetter of views&quot;.

One explanation for this pragmatic suspension of judgment or epistemic Epoché is that such questions contribute nothing to the practical methods of realizing awakeness during one&#x27;s lifetime and bring about the danger of substituting the experience of liberation by a conceptual understanding of the doctrine or by religious faith. According to the Buddha, the &quot;Dharma&quot; is not an ultimate end in itself or an explanation of all metaphysical reality, but a pragmatic set of teachings. The Buddha used two parables to clarify this point, the &#x27;Parable of the raft&#x27; and the Parable of the Poisoned Arrow. The &quot;Dharma&quot; is like a raft in the sense that it is only a pragmatic tool for attaining nirvana (&quot;for the purpose of crossing over, not for the purpose of holding onto&quot;, MN 22); once one has done this, one can discard the raft. It is also like medicine, in that the particulars of how one was injured by a poisoned arrow (i.e. metaphysics, etc.) do not matter in the act of removing and curing the arrow wound itself (removing suffering). In this sense, the Buddha was often called &quot;the great physician&quot; because his goal was to cure the human condition of suffering first and foremost, not to speculate about metaphysics.

Having said this, it is still clear that resisting and even refuting a false or slanted doctrine can be useful to extricate the interlocutor, or oneself, from error; hence, to advance in the way of liberation. Witness the Buddha&#x27;s confutation of several doctrines by Nigantha Nataputta and other purported sages which sometimes had large followings (e.g., Kula Sutta, Sankha Sutta, Brahmana Sutta). This shows that a virtuous and appropriate use of dialectics can take place. By implication, reasoning and argument shouldn&#x27;t be disparaged by Buddhists.

After the Buddha&#x27;s death, some Buddhists such as Dharmakirti went on to use the sayings of the Buddha as sound evidence equal to perception and inference.

===Transcendence===
Another possible reason why the Buddha refused to engage in metaphysics is that he saw ultimate reality and nirvana as devoid of sensory mediation and conception and therefore language itself is &quot;a priori&quot; inadequate to explain it. Thus, the Buddha&#x27;s silence does not indicate misology or disdain for philosophy. Rather, it indicates that he viewed the answers to these questions as not understandable by the unenlightened. Dependent arising provides a framework for analysis of reality that is not based on metaphysical assumptions regarding existence or non-existence, but instead on direct cognition of phenomena as they are presented to the mind in meditation.

The Buddha of the earliest Buddhists texts describes Dharma (in the sense of &quot;truth&quot;) as &quot;beyond reasoning&quot; or &quot;transcending logic&quot;, in the sense that reasoning is a subjectively introduced aspect of the way unenlightened humans perceive things, and the conceptual framework which underpins their cognitive process, rather than a feature of things as they really are. Going &quot;beyond reasoning&quot; means in this context penetrating the nature of reasoning from the inside, and removing the causes for experiencing any future stress as a result of it, rather than functioning outside the system as a whole.

===Meta-ethics===

The Buddha&#x27;s ethics are based on the soteriological need to eliminate suffering and on the premise of the law of karma. Buddhist ethics have been termed eudaimonic (with their goal being well-being) and also compared to virtue ethics (this approach began with Damien Keown). Keown writes that Buddhist Nirvana is analogous to the Aristotelian Eudaimonia, and that Buddhist moral acts and virtues derive their value from how they lead us to or act as an aspect of the nirvanic life.

The Buddha outlined five precepts (no killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, or drinking alcohol) which were to be followed by his disciples, lay and monastic. There are various reasons the Buddha gave as to why someone should be ethical.

First, the universe is structured in such a way that if someone intentionally commits a misdeed, a bad karmic fruit will be the result. Hence, from a pragmatic point of view, it is best to abstain from these negative actions which bring forth negative results. However, the important word here is &quot;intentionally&quot;: for the Buddha, karma is nothing else but intention/volition, and hence unintentionally harming someone does not create bad karmic results. Unlike the Jains who believed that karma was a quasi-physical element, for the Buddha karma was a volitional mental event, what Richard Gombrich calls &quot;an ethicised consciousness&quot;.

This idea leads into the second moral justification of the Buddha: intentionally performing negative actions reinforces and propagates mental defilements which keep persons bound to the cycle of rebirth and interfere with the process of liberation, and hence intentionally performing good karmic actions is participating in mental purification which leads to nirvana, the highest happiness. This perspective sees immoral acts as unskillful (&quot;akusala&quot;) in our quest for happiness, and hence it is pragmatic to do good.

The third meta-ethical consideration takes the view of not-self and our natural desire to end our suffering to its logical conclusion. Since there is no self, there is no reason to prefer our own welfare over that of others because there is no ultimate grounding for the differentiation of &quot;my&quot; suffering and someone else&#x27;s. Instead, an enlightened person would just work to end suffering &quot;tout court&quot;, without thinking of the conventional concept of persons. According to this argument, anyone who is selfish does so out of ignorance of the true nature of personal identity and irrationality.

==Buddhist schools and Abhidharma==

The main Indian Buddhist philosophical schools practiced a form of analysis termed &quot;Abhidharma&quot; which sought to systematize the teachings of the early Buddhist discourses (sutras). Abhidharma analysis broke down human experience into momentary phenomenal events or occurrences called &quot;dharmas&quot;. Dharmas are impermanent and dependent on other causal factors, they arise and pass as part of a web of other interconnected dharmas, and are never found alone. The Abhidharma schools held that the teachings of the Buddha in the sutras were merely conventional, while the Abhidharma analysis was ultimate truth (paramattha sacca), the way things really are when seen by an enlightened being. The Abhidharmic project has been likened as a form of phenomenology or process philosophy.

Abhidharma philosophers not only outlined what they believed to be an exhaustive listing of &quot;dharmas&quot; (Pali: dhammas), which are the ultimate phenomena, events or processes (and include physical and mental phenomena), but also the causal relations between them. In the Abhidharmic analysis, the only thing which is ultimately real is the interplay of dharmas in a causal stream; everything else is merely conceptual (&quot;paññatti&quot;) and nominal.

This view has been termed &quot;mereological reductionism&quot; by Mark Siderits because it holds that only impartite entities are real, not wholes. Abhidharmikas such as Vasubandhu argued that conventional things (tables, persons, etc.) &quot;disappear under analysis&quot; and that this analysis reveals only a causal stream of phenomenal events and their relations. The mainstream Abhidharmikas defended this view against their main Hindu rivals, the Nyaya school, who were substance theorists and posited the existence of universals. Some Abhidharmikas such as the Prajñaptivāda were also strict nominalists, and held that all things - even dharmas - were merely conceptual.

===The Abhidharma schools===
An important Abhidhamma work from the Theravāda school is the &quot;Kathāvatthu&quot; (&quot;Points of controversy&quot;), attributed to the Indian scholar-monk Moggaliputta-Tissa (–247 BCE). This text is important because it attempts to refute several philosophical views which had developed after the death of the Buddha, especially the theory that &#x27;all exists&#x27; (&quot;sarvāstivāda&quot;), the theory of momentariness (&quot;khāṇavāda&quot;) and the personalist view (&quot;pudgalavada&quot;). These were the major philosophical theories that divided the Buddhist Abhidharma schools in India.

After being brought to Sri Lanka in the first century BCE, the Pali language Theravada Abhidhamma tradition was heavily influenced by the works of Buddhaghosa (4-5th century AD), the most important philosopher and commentator of the Theravada school. The Theravada philosophical enterprise was mostly carried out in the genre of Atthakatha (commentaries) as well as sub-commentaries (tikas) on the classic Pali Abhidhamma texts. Abhidhamma study also included smaller doctrinal summaries and compendiums, like the &quot;Abhidhammattha-saṅgaha&quot; (The Compendium of Things contained in the Abhidhamma).

The Sarvāstivāda-Vaibhāṣika (sometimes just &quot;Vaibhāṣika&quot;) was one of the major Buddhist philosophical schools in India, and they were so named because of their belief that dharmas exist in all three times: past, present and future. Though the Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma system began as a mere categorization of mental events, their philosophers and exegetes such as Dharmatrata and Katyāyāniputra, the compiler of the &quot;Mahāvibhāṣa&quot; (&quot;Great Commentary&quot;), eventually refined this system into a robust realism, which also included a type of essentialism or substance theory. This realism was based on the nature of dharmas, which was called svabhava (&quot;self-nature&quot; or &quot;intrinsic existence&quot;). Svabhava is a sort of essence, though it is not a completely independent essence, since all dharmas were said to be causally dependent. The Sarvāstivāda system extended this realism across time, effectively positing a type of eternalism with regards to time; hence, the name of their school means &quot;the view that everything exists&quot;. Vaibhāṣika remained an influential school in North India during the medieval period. Perhaps the most influential figure in this tradition was the great scholar Saṃghabhadra. Another key figure was Śubhagupta (720–780), who was a Vaibhāṣika thinker within the epistemological (pramana) tradition.

Other Buddhist schools such as the Prajñaptivāda (&quot;the nominalists&quot;), as well as the Caitika Mahāsāṃghikas refused to accept the concept of svabhava. Thus, not all Abhidharma sources defend svabhava. For example, the main topic of the &quot;Tattvasiddhi Śāstra&quot; by Harivarman (3-4th century CE), an influential Abhidharma text, is the emptiness (shunyata) of dharmas. Indeed, this anti-essentialist nominalism was widespread among the Mahāsāṃghika sects. Another important feature of the Mahāsāṃghika tradition was its unique theory of consciousness. Many of the Mahāsāṃghika sub-schools defended a theory of self-awareness (&quot;svasaṃvedana&quot;) which held that consciousness can be simultaneously aware of itself as well as its intentional object. Some of these schools also held that the mind&#x27;s nature (&quot;cittasvabhāva&quot;) is fundamentally pure (&quot;mulavisuddha&quot;), but it can be contaminated by adventitious defilements.

The Theravādins and other schools, such as the Sautrāntikas (&quot;those who follow the sutras&quot;), often attacked the theories of the Sarvāstivādins, especially their theory of time. A major figure in this argument was the scholar Vasubandhu, a Sarvāstivādin monk himself (who was also influenced by the critiques of the Sautrantika school), who critiqued the theory of all exists and argued for philosophical presentism in his comprehensive treatise, the &quot;Abhidharmakośa.&quot; This work is the major Abhidharma text used in Tibetan and East Asian Buddhism today. The Theravāda also holds that dharmas only exist in the present, and are thus also presentists.

The Theravāda presentation of Abhidharma is also not as concerned with ontology as the Sarvāstivāda view, but is more of a phenomenological schema. Hence the concept of svabhava (Pali: sabhava) for the Theravādins is more of a certain characteristic or dependent feature of a dharma, than any sort of essence or metaphysical grounding. As the Sinhalese scholar Y. Karunadasa writes, the Pali tradition only postulates sabhava &quot;for the sake of definition and description.&quot; However, ultimately each dhamma (particular phenomenon) is not a singular independent existence. Thus, Karunadasa rejects the view that Theravada Abhidhamma defends an ontological pluralism (but it is also not monism either, since there is no single underlying ground of all things or metaphysical substratum). Instead they are merely processes that happen &quot;due to the interplay of a multitude of conditions.&quot; Karunadasa also describes the Theravada system as a &quot;critical realism&quot; which sees the ultimate existents as the myriad irreducible dhammas, and which also accepts the existence of an external world with entities that truly exist independently of cognition (as opposed to Mahayana forms of idealism).

Another important theory held by some Sarvāstivādins, Theravādins and Sautrāntikas was the theory of &quot;momentariness&quot; (Skt., kṣāṇavāda, Pali, khāṇavāda). This theory held that dhammas only last for a minute moment (&quot;ksana&quot;) after they arise. The Sarvāstivādins saw these &#x27;moments&#x27; in an atomistic way, as the smallest length of time possible (they also developed a material atomism). Reconciling this theory with their eternalism regarding time was a major philosophical project of the Sarvāstivāda. The Theravādins initially rejected this theory, as evidenced by the Khaṇikakathā of the Kathavatthu which attempts to refute the doctrine that &quot;all phenomena (dhamma) are as momentary as a single mental entity.&quot; However, momentariness with regards to mental dhammas (but not physical or rūpa dhammas) was later adopted by the Sri Lankan Theravādins, and it is possible that it was first introduced by the scholar Buddhagosa.

All Abhidharma schools also developed complex theories of causation and conditionality to explain how dharmas interacted with each other. Another major philosophical project of the Abhidharma schools was the explanation of perception. Some schools such as the Sarvastivadins explained perception as a type of phenomenalist realism while others such as the Sautrantikas preferred representationalism and held that we only perceive objects indirectly. The major argument used for this view by the Sautrāntikas was the &quot;time-lag argument.&quot; According to Mark Siderits: &quot;The basic idea behind the argument is that since there is always a tiny gap between when the sense comes in contact with the external object and when there is sensory awareness, what we are aware of can&#x27;t be the external object that the senses were in contact with, since it no longer exists.&quot; This is related to the theory of extreme momentariness.

One major philosophical view which was rejected by all the schools mentioned above was the view held by the Pudgalavadin or &#x27;personalist&#x27; schools. They seemed to have held that there was a sort of &#x27;personhood&#x27; in some ultimately real sense which was not reducible to the five aggregates. This controversial claim was in contrast to the other Buddhists of the time who held that a personality was a mere conceptual construction (prajñapti) and only conventionally real.

==Indian Mahāyāna philosophy==

From about the 1st century BCE, a new textual tradition began to arise in Indian Buddhist thought called Mahāyāna (Great Vehicle), which would slowly come to dominate Indian Buddhist philosophy. During the medieval period of Indian history, Buddhist philosophy thrived in large monastery complexes such as Nalanda, Vikramasila, and Vallabhi. These institutions became major centers of philosophical learning in North India (where both Buddhist and also non-Buddhist thought was studied and debated). Mahāyāna philosophers continued the philosophical projects of Abhidharma, while at the same time critiquing them and introducing many new concepts and ideas. Since the Mahāyāna held to the pragmatic concept of truth which states that doctrines are regarded as conditionally &quot;true&quot; in the sense of being spiritually beneficial, these new theories and practices were seen as &#x27;skillful means&#x27; (upaya).

The Mahayana also promoted the bodhisattva ideal, which included an attitude of compassion for all sentient beings. The Bodhisattva is someone who chooses to remain in &quot;samsara&quot; (the cycle of birth and death) to benefit all other beings who are suffering.

Major Mahayana philosophical schools and traditions include the Prajñaparamita, Madhyamaka, Yogācāra, Tathagatagarbha, the epistemological school of Dignaga, and in China the Huayan, Tiantai and Zen schools.

=== Prajñāpāramitā and Madhyamaka ===

The earliest Prajñāpāramitā-sutras (&quot;perfection of insight&quot; sutras) (circa 1st century BCE) emphasize the shunyata (emptiness) of &quot;all&quot; phenomena. It is thus a radical global nominalism and anti-essentialism, which sees all things as illusions and all of reality as a dreamlike appearance without any fundamental essence. The Prajñāpāramitā is said to be a transcendent spiritual knowledge of the nature of ultimate reality, which empty of any essence or foundation, like a universal mirage.

Thus, the &quot;Diamond Sutra&quot; (&quot;Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra&quot;) states: 
The &quot;Heart Sutra&quot; famously affirms the emptiness (shunyata) of all phenomena:
Oh, Sariputra, form does not differ from emptiness, and emptiness does not differ from form.Form is emptiness and emptiness is form; the same is true for feelings, perceptions, volitions and consciousness.The Prajñāpāramitā sources also note that this applies to every single phenomenon, even Buddhahood. The goal of the Buddhist aspirant in the Prajñāpāramitā texts is to awaken to the perfection of wisdom (&quot;prajñāpāramitā&quot;), a non-conceptual transcendent wisdom that knows the emptiness of all things while not being attached to anything (including the very idea of emptiness itself or perfect wisdom).

The Prajñāpāramitā teachings are associated with the work of the Buddhist philosopher Nāgārjuna ( – ) and the Madhyamaka (Middle way, or &quot;Centrism&quot;) school. Nāgārjuna was one of the most influential Indian Mahayana thinkers. He gave the classical arguments for the empty nature of all dharmas and attacked the essentialism found in various Abhidharma schools (and also in Hindu philosophy) in his magnum opus, &quot;The Root Verses on the Middle Way&quot; (&quot;Mūlamadhyamakakārikā&quot;). In the &quot;Mūlamadhyamakakārikā&quot;, Nagarjuna relies on reductio ad absurdum arguments to refute various theories which assume svabhava (an inherent essence or &quot;own being&quot;), dravya (substances) or any theory of existence (bhava). In this work, he covers topics such as causation, motion, and the sense faculties.

Nāgārjuna asserted a direct connection between, even identity of, dependent origination, non-self (&quot;anatta&quot;), and emptiness (&quot;śūnyatā&quot;). He pointed out that implicit in the early Buddhist concept of dependent origination is the lack of anatta (substantial being) underlying the participants in origination, so that they have no independent existence, a state identified as śūnyatā (i.e., emptiness of a nature or essence (&quot;svabhāva sunyam&quot;).

Later philosophers of the Madhyamaka school built upon Nāgārjuna&#x27;s analysis and defended Madhyamaka against their opponents. These included Āryadeva (3rd century CE), Nāgārjuna&#x27;s pupil; Candrakīrti (600–), who wrote an important commentary on the &quot;Mūlamadhyamakakārikā&quot;; and Shantideva (8th century), who is the key Mahayana ethicist.

The commentator Buddhapālita (c. 470–550) has been understood as the originator of the &#x27;prāsaṅgika&#x27; approach which is based on critiquing essentialism &quot;only&quot; through reductio arguments. He was criticized by Bhāvaviveka ( – ), who argued for the use of properly logical syllogisms to positively argue for emptiness (instead of just refuting the theories of others). These two approaches were later termed the prāsaṅgika and the svātantrika approaches to Madhyamaka by Tibetan philosophers and commentators.

Influenced by the work of Dignaga, Bhāvaviveka&#x27;s Madhyamika philosophy makes use of Buddhist epistemology. Candrakīrti, on the other hand, critiqued Bhāvaviveka&#x27;s adoption of the epistemological (&quot;pramana&quot;) tradition on the grounds that it contained subtle essentialism. He quotes Nagarjuna&#x27;s famous statement in the &quot;Vigrahavyavartani&quot; which says &quot;I have no thesis&quot; for his rejection of positive epistemic Madhyamaka statements. Candrakīrti held that a true Madhyamika could only use &quot;consequence&quot; (&quot;prasanga&quot;), in which one points out the inconsistencies of their opponent&#x27;s position without asserting an &quot;autonomous inference&quot; (&quot;svatantra&quot;), for no such inference can be ultimately true from the point of view of Madhyamaka.

In China, the Madhyamaka school (known as Sānlùn) was founded by Kumārajīva (344–413 CE), who translated the works of Nagarjuna to Chinese. Other Chinese Madhymakas include Kumārajīva &#x27;s pupil Sengzhao, Jizang (549–623), who wrote over 50 works on Madhyamaka, and Hyegwan, a Korean monk who brought Madhyamaka teachings to Japan.

===Yogācāra===
The Yogācāra school (&quot;Yoga practice&quot;) was a Buddhist philosophical tradition which arose in between the 2nd century CE and the 4th century CE and is associated with the philosophers and brothers Asanga and Vasubandhu and with various sutras such as the &quot;Sandhinirmocana Sutra&quot; and the &quot;Lankavatara Sutra&quot;. The central feature of Yogācāra thought is the concept of &quot;vijñapti-mātra&quot;, often translated as &quot;impressions only&quot; or &quot;appearance only&quot;. This has been interpreted as a form of Idealism or as a form of Phenomenology. Other names for the Yogācāra school are &#x27;vijñanavada&#x27; (the doctrine of consciousness) and &#x27;cittamatra&#x27; (mind-only).

Yogācāra thinkers like Vasubandhu argued against the existence of external objects by pointing out that we only ever have access to our own mental impressions, and hence our inference of the existence of external objects is based on faulty logic. Vasubandhu&#x27;s &quot;Triṃśikā-vijñaptimātratā (The Proof that There Are Only Impressions in Thirty Verses&quot;), begins thus:
I. This [world] is nothing but impressions, since it manifests itself as an unreal object, 
Just like the case of those with cataracts seeing unreal hairs in the moon and the like.

According to Vasubandhu then, all our experiences are like seeing hairs on the moon when we have cataracts, that is, we project our mental images into something &quot;out there&quot; when there are no such things. Vasubandhu then goes on to use the dream argument to argue that mental impressions do not require external objects to (1) seem to be spatio-temporally located, (2) to seem to have an inter-subjective quality, and (3) to seem to operate by causal laws. The fact that purely mental events can have causal efficacy and be intersubjective is proved by the event of a wet dream and by the mass or shared hallucinations created by the karma of certain types of beings. After having argued that impressions-only is a theory that can explain our everyday experience, Vasubandhu then appeals to - since we do not need the concept of external objects to explain reality, then we can do away with those superfluous concepts altogether as they are most likely just mentally superimposed on our concepts of reality by the mind. Yogācārins like Vasubandhu also attacked the realist theories of Buddhist atomism and the Abhidharma theory of svabhava. He argued that atoms, as conceived by the atomists (un-divisible entities), would not be able to come together to form larger aggregate entities, and hence that they were illogical concepts.

Inter-subjective reality for Vasubandhu is then the causal interaction between various mental streams and their karma, and does not include any external physical objects. The soteriological importance of this theory is that, by removing the concept of an external world, it also weakens the &#x27;internal&#x27; sense of self as an observer which is supposed to be separate from the external world. To dissolve the dualism of inner and outer is also to dissolve the sense of self and other. The later Yogacara commentator Sthiramati explains this thus:There is a grasper if there is something to be grasped, but not in the absence of what is to be grasped. Where there is nothing to be grasped, the absence of a grasper also follows, there is not just the absence of the thing to be grasped. Thus there arises the extra-mundane non-conceptual cognition that is alike without object and without cognizer.

Apart from its defense of an idealistic metaphysics and its attacks on realism, Yogācāra sources also developed a new theory of mind, based on the Eight Consciousnesses, which includes the innovative doctrine of the subliminal storehouse consciousness (Skt: ālayavijñāna).

Yogācāra thinkers also developed a positive account of ultimate reality based on three basic modes or &quot;natures&quot; (svabhāva). This metaphysical doctrine is central to their view of the ultimate and to their understanding of the doctrine of emptiness (śūnyatā).

=== The Dignāga-Dharmakīrti tradition ===

Dignāga (–540) and Dharmakīrti (c. 6-7th century) were Buddhist philosophers who developed a system of epistemology (pramana) and logic in their debates with the Brahminical philosophers in order to defend Buddhist doctrine. This tradition is called &quot;those who follow reasoning&quot; (Tibetan: &quot;rigs pa rjes su &#x27;brang ba&quot;); in modern literature, it is sometimes known by the Sanskrit &quot;pramāṇavāda&quot;, or &quot;the Epistemological School.&quot; They were associated with the Yogacara and Sautrantika schools, and defended theories held by both of these schools.

Dignāga&#x27;s influence was profound and led to an &quot;epistemological turn&quot; among all Buddhists and also all Sanskrit language philosophers in India after his death. In the centuries following Dignāga&#x27;s work, Sanskrit philosophers became much more focused on defending all of their propositions with fully developed theories of knowledge.

The &quot;School of Dignāga&quot; includes later philosophers and commentators like Santabhadra, Dharmottara (8th century), Prajñakaragupta (740–800 C.E.), Jñanasrimitra (975–1025), Ratnakīrti (11th century) and Śaṅkaranandana (fl. c. 9th or 10th century). The epistemology they developed defends the view that there are only two &#x27;instruments of knowledge&#x27; or &#x27;valid cognitions&#x27; (&quot;pramana&quot;): &quot;perception&quot; (&quot;pratyaksa&quot;) and &quot;inference&quot; (&quot;anumāṇa&quot;). Perception is a non-conceptual awareness of particulars which is bound by causality, while inference is reasonable, linguistic and conceptual.

These Buddhist philosophers argued in favor of the theory of momentariness, the Yogācāra &quot;awareness only&quot; view, the reality of particulars (&quot;svalakṣaṇa&quot;), atomism, nominalism and the self-reflexive nature of consciousness (&quot;svasaṃvedana&quot;). They attacked Hindu theories of God (Isvara), universals, the authority of the Vedas, and the existence of a permanent soul (&quot;atman&quot;).

=== Later Yogācāra developments ===
After the time of Asanga and Vasubandhu, the Yogācāra school developed in different directions. One branch focused on epistemology (this would become the school of Dignaga). Another branch focused on expanding the Yogācāra&#x27;s metaphysics and philosophy. This latter tradition includes figures like Dharmapala of Nalanda, Sthiramati, Chandragomin (who was known to have debated the Madhyamaka thinker Candrakirti), and Śīlabhadra (a top scholar at Nalanda). Yogācārins such as Paramartha and Guṇabhadra brought the school to China and translated Yogacara works there, where it is known as Wéishí-zōng or Fǎxiàng-zōng. An important contribution to East Asian Yogācāra is Xuanzang&#x27;s &quot;Cheng Weishi Lun&quot;, or &quot;Discourse on the Establishment of Consciousness Only&quot;.

A later development is the rise of a syncretic tradition of Yogācāra-tathāgatagarbha thought. This group adopted the doctrine of &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; (the buddha-womb, buddha-source, or &quot;buddha-within&quot;) found in various &quot;tathāgatagarbha sutras.&quot; This hybrid school eventually went on to equate the &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; with the pure aspect of the storehouse consciousness. Some key sources of this school are the &quot;Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra&quot;, &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot; (&quot;Uttaratantra&quot;), and in China, the influential &quot;Mahayana Awakening of Faith treatise.&quot; One key figure of this tradition was Paramārtha, an Indian monk who was an important translator in China. He promoted a new theory that said there was a &quot;stainless consciousness&quot; (&quot;amala-vijñāna,&quot; a pure wisdom within all beings), which he equated with the buddha-nature (tathāgatagarbha). This synthetic tradition also became important in later Indian Buddhism, where the &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot; became the key text.

Another later development was the synthesis of Yogācāra with Madhyamaka. Jñānagarbha (8th century) and his student Śāntarakṣita (725–788) brought together Yogacara, Madhyamaka and the Dignaga school of epistemology into a philosophical synthesis known as the &quot;Yogācāra-Svatantrika-Mādhyamika&quot;. Śāntarakṣita was also instrumental in the introduction of Buddhism and the Sarvastivadin monastic ordination lineage to Tibet, which was conducted at Samye. Śāntarakṣita&#x27;s disciples included Haribhadra and Kamalaśīla. This philosophical tradition is influential in Tibetan Buddhist thought.

Perhaps the most important debate among late Yogācāra philosophers was the debate between alikākāravāda (Tib. &quot;rnam rdzun pa&quot;, False Aspectarians, also known as Nirākāravāda) and Satyākāravāda (&quot;rnam bden pa&quot;, True Aspectarians, also known as sākāravāda). The crux of the debate was the question of whether mental appearances, images or “aspects” (&quot;ākāra&quot;) are true (&quot;satya&quot;) or false (&quot;alika&quot;). The Satyākāravāda camp, defended by scholars like Prajñakaragupta (ca. 8th–9th century), and Jñānaśrīmitra (ca. 980–1040), held that images in consciousness have a real existence, since they arise from a real consciousness. Meanwhile, Alikākāravāda defenders like Sthiramati and Ratnākaraśānti (ca. 970–1045) argued that mental appearances do not really exist, and are false (alīka) or illusory. For these thinkers, the only thing which is real is a pure self-aware consciousness which is contentless (nirākāra, “without images”).

=== Buddha-nature thought ===
The &quot;tathāgathagarbha sutras&quot;, in a departure from mainstream Buddhist language, insist that there is a real potential for awakening is inherent to every sentient being. They marked a shift from a largely apophatic (negative) method within Buddhism to a decidedly more cataphatic (positive) mode. The main topic of this genre of literature is the &quot;tathāgata-garbha,&quot; which can mean the womb or embryo of a Tathāgata (i.e. a Buddha) and is what allows someone to become a Buddha. Another similar term used for this idea is &quot;buddhadhātu&quot; (buddha-nature or source of the Buddhas).

Prior to the period of these scriptures, Mahāyāna metaphysics had been dominated by teachings on emptiness. The language used by this approach is primarily negative, and the buddha-nature literature can be seen as an attempt to state orthodox Buddhist teachings of dependent origination using positive language instead, to prevent people from being turned away from Buddhism by a false impression of nihilism. In these sutras, the perfection of the wisdom of not-self is stated to be the true self (atman). The word &quot;self&quot; (&quot;atman&quot;) is used in a way idiosyncratic to these sutras; the &quot;true self&quot; is described as the perfection of the wisdom of not-self in the &quot;Buddha-Nature Treatise&quot; (&quot;Fóxìng lùn&quot;, 佛性論, T. 1610) of Paramārtha, for example. The ultimate goal of the path is then characterized using a range of positive language that had been used previously in Indian philosophy by essentialist philosophers, but which was now adapted to describe the positive realities of Buddhahood.

Perhaps the most influential source in the Indian tradition for this teaching is the &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot; (5th century CE). This śāstra brought together all the major themes of the tathāgatagārbha theory into a single treatise. The &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot; sees the tathāgatagarbha as being an inherent nature in all things which is omnipresent, all-pervasive, non-conceptual, free of suffering and inherently blissful. It also describes buddha nature as “the intrinsically stainless nature of the mind” (&quot;cittaprakṛtivaimalya&quot;). Indeed, in many later Indian sources, the &quot;tathāgathagarbha&quot; teachings also come to be identified with the similar doctrine of the luminous mind (prabhasvara-citta). This ancient idea holds that the mind is inherently pure, and that defilements are only adventitious. In the &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot;, this originally pure (prakṛtipariśuddha) nature (i.e. the fully purified buddha-nature) is further described through numerous terms such as: unconditioned (asaṃskṛta), unborn (ajāta), unarisen (anutpanna), eternal (nitya), changeless (dhruva), and permanent (śāśvata).

According to some scholars, &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; does not represent a substantial self; rather, it is a positive language expression of emptiness and represents the potentiality to realize Buddhahood through Buddhist practices. In this interpretation, the intention of the teaching of &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; is soteriological rather than metaphysical.

==Vajrayāna Buddhism==

Vajrayāna (also Mantrayāna, Sacret Mantra, Tantrayāna and Esoteric Buddhism) is a Mahayana Buddhist tradition associated with a group of texts known as the Buddhist Tantras which had developed into a major force in India by the eighth century. By this time Indian Tantric scholars were developing philosophical defenses, hermeneutics and explanations of the Buddhist tantric systems, especially through commentaries on key tantras such as the &quot;Guhyasamāja Tantra&quot;, &quot;Mahavairocana sutra&quot;, and the &quot;Guhyagarbha Tantra&quot;.

While the view of the Vajrayāna was based on the earlier Madhyamaka, Yogacara and Buddha-nature theories, it saw itself as being a faster vehicle to liberation containing many skillful methods (&quot;upaya&quot;) of tantric ritual. The need for an explication and defense of the Tantras arose out of the unusual nature of the rituals associated with them, which included the use of secret mantras, alcohol, sexual yoga, complex visualizations of mandalas filled with wrathful deities and other practices which were discordant with or at least novel in comparison to traditional Buddhist practice.

The &quot;Guhyasamāja Tantra&quot;, for example, states: &quot;you should kill living beings, speak lying words, take things that are not given and have sex with many women&quot;. Other features of tantra included a focus on the physical body as the means to liberation, and a reaffirmation of feminine elements, feminine deities and a positive view of sexuality.

The defense of these tantric practices is based on the theory of transformation which states that negative mental factors and physical actions can be cultivated and transformed in a ritual setting. The &quot;Hevajra tantra&quot; states:

Those things by which evil men are bound, others turn into means and gain thereby release from the bonds of existence. By passion the world is bound, by passion too it is released, but by heretical Buddhists, this practice of reversals is not known.

Another hermeneutic of Buddhist Tantric commentaries such as the &quot;Vimalaprabha&quot; (&quot;Stainless Light&quot;) of Pundarika (a commentary on the &quot;Kalacakra Tantra&quot;) is one of interpreting taboo or unethical statements in the Tantras as metaphorical statements about tantric practice and physiology. For example, in the &quot;Vimalaprabha&quot;, &quot;killing living beings&quot; refers to stopping the prana at the top of the head. In the Tantric Candrakirti&#x27;s &quot;Pradipoddyotana&quot;, a commentary to the &quot;Guhyasamaja Tantra&quot;, killing living beings is glossed as &quot;making them void&quot; by means of a &quot;special samadhi&quot; which according to Bus-ton is associated with completion stage tantric practice.

Douglas Duckworth notes that Vajrayāna philosophical outlook is one of embodiment, which sees the physical and cosmological body as already containing wisdom and divinity. Liberation (nirvana) and Buddhahood are not seen as something outside the body, or an event in the future, but as imminently present and accessible right now through unique tantric practices like deity yoga. Hence, Vajrayāna is also called the &quot;resultant vehicle&quot;, that is to say, it is the spiritual vehicle that relies on the immanent nature of the result of practice (liberation), which is already present in all beings. Duckworth names the philosophical view of Vajrayāna as a form of pantheism, by which he means the belief that every existing entity is in some sense divine and that all things express some form of unity.

Major Indian Tantric Buddhist philosophers such as Buddhaguhya, Padmavajra (author of the &quot;Guhyasiddhi&quot; commentary), Nagarjuna (the 7th-century disciple of Saraha), Indrabhuti (author of the &quot;Jñānasiddhi&quot;), Anangavajra, Dombiheruka, Durjayacandra, Ratnākaraśānti and Abhayakaragupta wrote tantric texts and commentaries systematizing the tradition.

Others such as Vajrabodhi and Śubhakarasiṃha brought tantra to Tang China (716 to 720), and tantric philosophy continued to be developed in Chinese and Japanese by thinkers such as Yi Xing (683–727) and Kūkai (774– 835).

In Tibet, philosophers such as Sakya Pandita (1182-28–1251), Longchenpa (1308–1364) and Tsongkhapa (1357–1419) continued the tradition of Buddhist Tantric philosophy in Classical Tibetan.

==Tibetan Buddhist philosophy==

Tibetan Buddhist philosophy is mainly a continuation and refinement of the Indian Mahayana philosophical traditions. The initial efforts of Śāntarakṣita and Kamalaśīla brought their eclectic scholarly tradition to Tibet.

The initial work of early Tibetan Buddhist philosophers was in the translation of classical Indian philosophical treatises and the writing of commentaries. This initial period is from the 8th to the 10th century. Early Tibetan commentator-philosophers were heavily influenced by the work of Dharmakirti and these include Ngok Loden Sherab (1059–1109) and Chaba Chökyi Senge (1182–1251). Their works are now lost.

The 12th and 13th centuries saw the translation of the works of Chandrakirti, the promulgation of his views in Tibet by scholars such as Patsab Nyima Drakpa, Kanakavarman and Jayananda (12th century) and the development of the Tibetan debate between the prasangika and svatantrika views which continues to this day among Tibetan Buddhist schools. The main disagreement between these views is the use of reasoned argument. For Śāntarakṣita&#x27;s school, reason is useful in establishing arguments that lead one to a correct understanding of emptiness. Then, through the use of meditation, one can reach non-conceptual gnosis that does not rely on reason. However, Chandrakirti rejects this idea, because meditation on emptiness cannot possibly involve any object. Reason&#x27;s role for him is purely negative. Reason is used to negate any essentialist view, and then eventually reason must also negate itself, along with any conceptual proliferation (&quot;prapañca&quot;).

Another very influential figure from this early period is Mabja Jangchub Tsöndrü (d. 1185), who wrote an important commentary on Nagarjuna&#x27;s &quot;Mūlamadhyamakakārikā&quot;. Mabja was studied under the Dharmakirtian Chaba and also the Candrakirti scholar Patsab. His work shows an attempt to steer a middle course between their views, he affirms the conventional usefulness of pramāṇa epistemology, but also accepts Candrakirti&#x27;s prasangika views. Mabja&#x27;s Madhyamaka scholarship was very influential on later Tibetan Madhyamikas such as Longchenpa, Tsongkhapa, Gorampa, and Mikyö Dorje.

There are various Tibetan Buddhist schools or monastic orders. According to Georges B.J. Dreyfus, within Tibetan thought, the Sakya school holds a mostly anti-realist philosophical position (which sees &quot;saṁvṛtisatya&quot; / conventional truth as an illusion), while the Gelug school tends to defend a form of realism (which accepts that conventional truth is in some sense real and true, yet dependently originated). The Kagyu and Nyingma schools also tend to follow Sakya anti-realism (with some differences).

===Shentong and Buddha nature===
The 14th century saw increasing interest in the Buddha nature texts and doctrines. This can be seen in the work of the third Kagyu Karmapa Rangjung Dorje (1284–1339), especially his treatise &quot;Profound Inner Meaning&quot;. This treatise describes ultimate nature or suchness as Buddha nature which is the basis for nirvana and samsara, radiant in nature and empty in essence, surpassing thought.

One of the most important theoriests of buddha-nature in Tibet was the scholar-yogi Dölpopa Shérap Gyeltsen (c. 1292–1361). A figure of the Jonang school, Dölpopa developed a view called shentong (Wylie: gzhan , &#x27;other emptiness&#x27;), based on earlier Yogacara and Buddha-nature ideas present in Indian sources (including the buddha-nature literature, the &quot;Kālacakratantra&quot; and the works of Ratnākaraśānti). The shentong view holds that Buddhahood is already immanent in all living beings as an eternal and all-pervaside non-dual wisdom he termed &quot;all-basis wisdom&quot; or &quot;gnosis of the ground of all&quot; (Tib. &quot;kun gzhi ye shes&quot;, Skt. ālaya-jñāna). This view holds that all relative phenomena are empty of inherent existence, but that the ultimate reality, the buddha-wisdom (&quot;buddha jñana&quot;) is &quot;not empty&quot; of its own inherent existence.

According to Dölpopa, all beings are said to have the Buddha nature, the non-dual wisdom which is real, unchanging, permanent, non-conditioned, eternal, blissful and compassionate. This ultimate buddha wisdom is &quot;uncreated and indestructible, unconditioned and beyond the chain of dependent origination&quot; and is the basis for both samsara and nirvana. Dolpopa&#x27;s shentong view also taught that ultimate reality was truly a &quot;Great Self&quot; or &quot;Supreme Self&quot; referring to works such as the &quot;Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra&quot;, the &quot;Aṅgulimālīya Sūtra&quot; and the &quot;Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra.&quot;

The shentong view had an influence on philosophers of other schools, such as Nyingma and Kagyu thinkers, and was also widely criticized in some circles as being similar to the Hindu notions of Atman. The Shentong philosophy was also expounded in Tibet and Mongolia by the later Jonang scholar Tāranātha (1575–1634) and numerous later figures of the Jonang tradition. In the late 17th century, the Jonang order and its teachings came under attack by the 5th Dalai Lama, who converted the majority of their monasteries in Tibet to the Gelug order, although several survived in secret.

===Gelug===

Je Tsongkhapa (Dzong-ka-ba) (1357–1419) founded the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism, which came to dominate the country through the office of the Dalai Lama and is the major defender of the Prasaṅgika Madhyamaka view. His work is influenced by the philosophy of Candrakirti and Dharmakirti. Tsongkhapa&#x27;s magnum opus is &quot;The Ocean of Reasoning&quot;, a Commentary on Nagarjuna&#x27;s &quot;Mulamadhyamakakarika&quot;. Gelug philosophy is based upon the study of Madhyamaka texts and Tsongkhapa&#x27;s works as well as formal debate (rtsod pa).

Tsongkhapa defended Prasangika Madhyamaka as the highest view and critiqued the svatantrika position. Tsongkhapa argued that, because svatantrika conventionally establishes things by their own characteristics, they fail to completely understand the emptiness of phenomena and hence do not achieve the same realization. Drawing on Chandrakirti, Tsongkhapa rejected the Yogacara teachings, even as a provisional stepping point to the Madhyamaka view. Tsongkhapa was also critical of the Shengtong view of Dolpopa, which he saw as dangerously absolutist and hence outside the middle way. Tsongkhapa identified two major flaws in interpretations of Madhyamika, under-negation (of svabhava or own essence), which could lead to Absolutism, and over-negation, which could lead to Nihilism. Tsongkhapa&#x27;s solution to this dilemma was the promotion of the use of inferential reasoning only within the conventional realm of the two truths framework, allowing for the use of reason for ethics, conventional monastic rules and promoting a conventional epistemic realism, while holding that, from the view of ultimate truth (&quot;paramarthika satya&quot;), all things (including Buddha nature and Nirvana) are empty of inherent existence (svabhava), and that true liberation is this realization of emptiness.

Sakya scholars such as Rongtön and Gorampa disagreed with Tsongkhapa, and argued that the prasangika svatantrika distinction was merely pedagogical. Gorampa also critiqued Tsongkhapa&#x27;s realism, arguing that the structures which allow an empty object to be presented as conventionally real eventually dissolve under analysis and are thus unstructured and non-conceptual (spros bral). Tsongkhapa&#x27;s students Gyel-tsap, Kay-drup, and Ge-dun-drup set forth an epistemological realism against the Sakya scholars&#x27; anti-realism.

===Sakya===
Sakya Pandita (1182–1251) was a 13th-century head of the Sakya school and ruler of Tibet. He was also one of the most important Buddhist philosophers in the Tibetan tradition, writing works on logic and epistemology and promoting Dharmakirti&#x27;s &quot;Pramanavarttika&quot; (Commentary on Valid Cognition) as central to the scholastic study. Sakya Pandita&#x27;s &#x27;Treasury of Logic on Valid Cognition&#x27; (&quot;Tshad ma rigs pa&#x27;i gter&quot;) set forth the classic Sakya epistemic anti-realist position, arguing that concepts such as universals are not known through valid cognition and hence are not real objects of knowledge. Sakya Pandita was also critical of theories of sudden awakening, which were held by some teachers of the &quot;Chinese Great Perfection&quot; in Tibet.

Later Sakyas such as Gorampa (1429–1489) and Sakya Chokden (1428–1507) would develop and defend Sakya anti-realism, and they are seen as the major interpreters and critics of Sakya Pandita&#x27;s philosophy. Sakya Chokden also critiqued Tsongkhapa&#x27;s interpretation of Madhyamaka and Dolpopa&#x27;s Shentong. In his &quot;Definite ascertainment of the middle way&quot;, Chokden criticized Tsongkhapa&#x27;s view as being too logo-centric and still caught up in conceptualization about the ultimate reality which is beyond language. Sakya Chokden&#x27;s philosophy attempted to reconcile the views of the Yogacara and Madhyamaka, seeing them both as valid and complementary perspectives on ultimate truth. Madhyamaka is seen by Chokden as removing the fault of taking the unreal as being real, and Yogacara removes the fault of the denial of Reality. Likewise, the Shentong and Rangtong views are seen as complementary by Sakya Chokden; Rangtong negation is effective in cutting through all clinging to wrong views and conceptual rectification, while Shentong is more amenable for describing and enhancing meditative experience and realization. Therefore, for Sakya Chokden, the same realization of ultimate reality can be accessed and described in two different but compatible ways.

===Nyingma===

The Nyingma school is strongly influenced by the view of Dzogchen (Great Perfection) and the Dzogchen Tantric literature. Longchenpa (1308–1364) was a major philosopher of the Nyingma school and wrote an extensive number of works on the Tibetan practice of Dzogchen and on Buddhist Tantra. These include the &quot;Seven Treasures&quot;, the &quot;Trilogy of Natural Ease&quot;, and his &quot;Trilogy of Dispelling Darkness&quot;. Longchenpa&#x27;s works provide a philosophical understanding of Dzogchen, a defense of Dzogchen in light of the sutras, as well as practical instructions. For Longchenpa, the ground of reality is luminous emptiness, rigpa (&quot;knowledge&quot;), or buddha nature, and this ground is also the bridge between sutra and tantra. Longchenpa&#x27;s philosophy sought to establish the positive aspects of Buddha nature thought against the totally negative theology of Madhyamika without straying into the absolutism of Dolpopa. For Longchenpa, the basis for Dzogchen and Tantric practice in Vajrayana is the &quot;Ground&quot; or &quot;Basis&quot; (&quot;gzhi&quot;), the immanent Buddha nature, &quot;the primordially luminous reality that is unconditioned and spontaneously present&quot; which is &quot;free from all elaborated extremes&quot;.

=== Rimé movement ===
The 19th century saw the rise of the Rimé movement (non-sectarian, unbiased) which sought to push back against the politically dominant Gelug school&#x27;s criticisms of the Sakya, Kagyu, Nyingma and Bon philosophical views, and develop a more eclectic or universal system of textual study. Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo (1820–1892) and Jamgön Kongtrül (1813–1899) were the founders of Rimé. The Rimé movement came to prominence at a point in Tibetan history when the religious climate had become partisan. The aim of the movement was &quot;a push towards a middle ground where the various views and styles of the different traditions were appreciated for their individual contributions rather than being refuted, marginalized, or banned.&quot;

Philosophically, Jamgön Kongtrül defended Shentong as being compatible with Madhyamaka while another Rimé scholar Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso (1846–1912) criticized Tsongkhapa from a Nyingma perspective. Mipham argued that the view of the middle way is Unity (zung &#x27;jug), meaning that from the ultimate perspective the duality of sentient beings and Buddhas is also dissolved. Mipham also affirmed the view of &quot;rangtong&quot; (self emptiness).

The later Nyingma scholar Botrul (1894–1959) classified the major Tibetan Madhyamaka positions as shentong (other emptiness), Nyingma rangtong (self emptiness) and Gelug bdentong (emptiness of true existence). The main difference between them is their &quot;object of negation&quot;; shengtong states that inauthentic experience is empty, rangtong negates any conceptual reference and bdentong negates any true existence.

The 14th Dalai Lama was also influenced by this non-sectarian approach. Having studied under teachers from all major Tibetan Buddhist schools, his philosophical position tends to be that the different perspectives on emptiness are complementary:

There is a tradition of making a distinction between two different perspectives on the nature of emptiness: one is when emptiness is presented within a philosophical analysis of the ultimate reality of things, in which case it ought to be understood in terms of a non-affirming negative phenomena. On the other hand, when it is discussed from the point of view of experience, it should be understood more in terms of an affirming negation – 14th Dalai Lama

==East Asian Buddhism==
===Tiantai===

The schools of Buddhism that had existed in China prior to the emergence of the Tiantai are generally believed to represent direct transplantations from India, with little modification to their basic doctrines and methods. The Tiantai school, founded by Zhiyi (538–597), was the first truly unique Chinese Buddhist philosophical school. Tiantai doctrine sought to bring together all Buddhist teachings into a comprehensive system based on the ekayana (&quot;one vehicle&quot;) doctrine taught in the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;.

Tiantai&#x27;s metaphysics is an immanent holism, which sees every phenomenon (dharma) as conditioned and manifested by the whole of reality (the totality of all other dharmas). Every instant of experience is a reflection of every other, and hence, suffering and nirvana, good and bad, Buddhahood and evildoing, are all &quot;inherently entailed&quot; within each other.

Tiantai metaphysics is entailed in their teaching of the &quot;three truths&quot;, which is an extension of the Mādhyamaka two truths doctrine. The three truths are: the conventional truth of appearance, the truth of emptiness and the third truth of &#x27;the exclusive Center&#x27; (但中 &quot;danzhong&quot;) or middle way, which is beyond conventional truth and emptiness. This third truth is the Absolute and expressed by the claim that nothing is &quot;Neither-Same-Nor-Different&quot; than anything else, but rather each &#x27;thing&#x27; is the absolute totality of all things manifesting as a particular, everything is mutually contained within each thing. Everything is a reflection of &quot;The Ultimate Reality of All Appearances&quot; (諸法實相 &quot;zhufashixiang&quot;) and each thought &quot;contains three thousand worlds&quot;. This perspective allows the Tiantai school to state such seemingly paradoxical things as &quot;evil is ineradicable from the highest good, Buddhahood.&quot; Moreover, in Tiantai, nirvana and samsara are ultimately the same; as Zhiyi writes, &quot;a single, unalloyed reality is all there is – no entities whatever exist outside of it.&quot;

While Zhiyi did write &quot;one thought contains three thousand worlds&quot;, this does not entail idealism. According to Zhiyi, &quot;the objects of the [true] aspects of reality are not something produced by Buddhas, gods, or men. They exist inherently on their own and have no beginning&quot; (&quot;The Esoteric Meaning&quot;, 210). This is then a form of realism, which sees the mind as real as the world, interconnected with and inseparable from it. In Tiantai thought, ultimate reality is simply the very phenomenal world of interconnected events or dharmas.

Other key figures of Tiantai thought are Zhanran (711–782) and Siming Zhili (960–1028). Zhanran developed the idea that non-sentient beings have buddha nature, since they are also a reflection of the Absolute. In Japan, this school was known as Tendai and was first brought to the island by Saicho. Tendai thought is more syncretic and draws on Huayan and East Asian Esoteric Buddhism.

===Huayan===
The Huayan school is the other native Chinese doctrinal system. Huayan is known for the doctrine of &quot;interpenetration&quot; (Sanskrit: &quot;yuganaddha&quot;), based on the &quot;Avataṃsaka Sūtra&quot; (&quot;Flower Garland Sutra&quot;). Huayan holds that all phenomena (Sanskrit: &quot;dharmas&quot;) are deeply interconnected, mutually arising and that every phenomenon contains all other phenomena. Various metaphors and images are used to illustrate this idea. The first is known as Indra&#x27;s net. The net is set with jewels which have the extraordinary property that they reflect all of the other jewels, while the reflections also contain every other reflection, ad infinitum. The second image is that of the world text. This image portrays the world as consisting of an enormous text which is as large as the universe itself. The words of the text are composed of the phenomena that make up the world. However, every atom of the world contains the whole text within it. It is the work of a Buddha to let out the text so that beings can be liberated from suffering.

Fazang (Fa-tsang, 643–712), one of the most important Huayan thinkers, wrote &#x27;Essay on the Golden Lion&#x27; and &#x27;Treatise on the Five Teachings&#x27;, which contain other metaphors for the interpenetration of reality. He also used the metaphor of a house of mirrors. Fazang introduced the distinction of &quot;the Realm of Principle&quot; and &quot;the Realm of Things&quot;. This theory was further developed by Cheng-guan (738–839) into the major Huayan thesis of &quot;the fourfold Dharmadhatu&quot; (dharma realm): the Realm of Principle, the Realm of Things, the Realm of the Noninterference between Principle and Things, and the Realm of the Noninterference of All Things. The first two are the universal and the particular, the third is the interpenetration of universal and particular, and the fourth is the interpenetration of all particulars. The third truth was explained by the metaphor of a golden lion: the gold is the universal and the particular is the shape and features of the lion. 
While both Tiantai and Huayan hold to the interpenetration and interconnection of all things, their metaphysics have some differences. Huayan metaphysics is influenced by Yogacara thought and is closer to idealism. The Avatamsaka sutra compares the phenomenal world to a dream, an illusion, and a magician&#x27;s conjuring. The sutra states nothing has true reality, location, beginning and end, or substantial nature. The Avatamsaka also states that &quot;The triple world is illusory – it is only made by one mind&quot;, and Fazang echoes this by writing, &quot;outside of mind there is not a single thing that can be apprehended.&quot; Furthermore, according to Huayan thought, each mind creates its own world &quot;according to their mental patterns&quot;, and &quot;these worlds are infinite in kind&quot; and constantly arising and passing away. However, in Huayan, the mind is not real either, but also empty. The true reality in Huayan, the noumenon, or &quot;Principle&quot;, is likened to a mirror, while phenomena are compared to reflections in the mirror. It is also compared to the ocean, and phenomena to waves.

In Korea, this school was known as Hwaeom and is represented in the work of Wonhyo (617–686), who also wrote about the idea of essence-function, a central theme in Korean Buddhist thought. In Japan, Huayan is known as Kegon and one of its major proponents was Myōe, who also introduced Tantric practices.

===Chan and Japanese Buddhism===

The philosophy of Chinese Chan Buddhism and Japanese Zen is based on various sources; these include Chinese Madhyamaka (&quot;Sānlùn&quot;), Yogacara (&quot;Wéishí&quot;), the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra, and the Buddha nature texts. An important issue in Chan is that of subitism or &quot;sudden awakening&quot;, the idea that insight happens all at once in a flash of insight. This view was promoted by Shenhui and is a central issue discussed in the Platform Sutra, a key Chan scripture composed in China.

Huayan philosophy also had an influence on Chan. The theory of the Fourfold Dharmadhatu influenced the Five Ranks of Dongshan Liangjie (806–869), the founder of the Caodong Chan lineage. Guifeng Zongmi, who was also a patriarch of Huayan Buddhism, wrote extensively on the philosophy of Chan and on the Avatamsaka sutra.

Japanese Buddhism during the 6th and 7th centuries saw an increase in the proliferation of new schools and forms of thought, a period known as the six schools of Nara (&quot;Nanto Rokushū&quot;). The Kamakura Period (1185–1333) also saw another flurry of intellectual activity. During this period, the influential figure of Nichiren (1222–1282) made the practice and universal message of the Lotus Sutra more readily available to the population. He is of particular importance in the history of thought and religion, as his teachings constitute a separate sect of Buddhism, one of the only major sects to have originated in Japan

Also during the Kamakura period, the founder of Soto Zen, Dogen (1200–1253), wrote many works on the philosophy of Zen, and the &quot;Shobogenzo&quot; is his magnum opus. In Korea, Chinul was an important exponent of Seon Buddhism at around the same time.

===Esoteric Buddhism===
Tantric Buddhism arrived in China in the 7th century, during the Tang dynasty. In China, this form of Buddhism is known as Mìzōng (密宗), or &quot;Esoteric School&quot;, and &quot;Zhenyan&quot; (true word, Sanskrit: Mantrayana). Kūkai (AD774–835) is a major Japanese Buddhist philosopher and the founder of the Tantric Shingon (true word) school in Japan. He wrote on a wide variety of topics such as public policy, language, the arts, literature, music and religion. After studying in China under Huiguo, Kūkai brought together various elements into a cohesive philosophical system of Shingon.

Kūkai&#x27;s philosophy is based on the Mahavairocana Tantra and the Vajrasekhara Sutra (both from the seventh century). His &quot;Benkenmitsu nikkyôron&quot; (Treatise on the Differences Between Esoteric and Exoteric Teachings) outlines the difference between exoteric, mainstream Mahayana Buddhism (kengyô) and esoteric Tantric Buddhism (mikkyô). Kūkai provided the theoretical framework for the esoteric Buddhist practices of Mantrayana, bridging the gap between the doctrine of the sutras and tantric practices. At the foundation of Kūkai&#x27;s thought is the Trikaya doctrine, which holds there are three &quot;bodies of the Buddha&quot;.

According to Kūkai, esoteric Buddhism has the Dharmakaya (Jpn: &quot;hosshin&quot;, embodiment of truth) as its source, which is associated with Vairocana Buddha (Dainichi). Hosshin is embodied absolute reality and truth. Hosshin is mostly ineffable but can be experienced through esoteric practices such as mudras and mantras. While Mahayana is taught by the historical Buddha (nirmāṇakāya), it does not have ultimate reality as its source or the practices to experience the esoteric truth. For Shingon, from an enlightened perspective, the whole phenomenal world itself is also the teaching of Vairocana. The body of the world, its sounds and movements, is the body of truth (dharma) and furthermore it is also identical with the personal body of the cosmic Buddha. For Kūkai, world, actions, persons and Buddhas are all part of the cosmic monologue of Vairocana, they are the truth being preached, to its own self manifestations. This is &quot;hosshin seppô&quot; (literally: &quot;the dharmakâya&#x27;s expounding of the Dharma&quot;) which can be accessed through mantra which is the cosmic language of Vairocana emanating through cosmic vibration concentrated in sound. In a broad sense, the universe itself is a huge text expressing ultimate truth (Dharma) which must be &quot;read&quot;.

Dainichi means &quot;Great Sun&quot; and Kūkai uses this as a metaphor for the great primordial Buddha, whose teaching and presence illuminates and pervades all, like the light of the sun. This immanent presence also means that every being already has access to the liberated state (hongaku) and Buddha nature, and that, because of this, there is the possibility of &quot;becoming Buddha in this very embodied existence&quot; (&quot;sokushinjôbutsu&quot;). This is achieved because of the non-dual relationship between the macrocosm of Hosshin and the microcosm of the Shingon practitioner.

Kūkai&#x27;s exposition of what has been called Shingon&#x27;s &quot;metaphysics&quot; is based on the three aspects of the cosmic truth or Hosshin – body, appearance and function. The body is the physical and mental elements, which are the body and mind of the cosmic Buddha and which is also empty (Shunyata). The physical universe for Shingon contains the interconnected mental and physical events. The appearance aspect is the form of the world, which appears as mandalas of interconnected realms and is depicted in mandala art such as the Womb Realm mandala. The function is the movement and change which happens in the world, which includes change in forms, sounds and thought. These forms, sounds and thoughts are expressed by the Shingon practitioner in various rituals and tantric practices which allow them to connect with and inter-resonate with Dainichi and hence attain liberation here and now.

==Modern philosophy==


In Sri Lanka, Buddhist modernists such as Anagarika Dharmapala (1864–1933) and the American convert Henry Steel Olcott sought to show that Buddhism was rational and compatible with modern Scientific ideas such as the theory of evolution. Dharmapala also argued that Buddhism included a strong social element, interpreting it as liberal, altruistic and democratic.

A later Sri Lankan philosopher, K. N. Jayatilleke (1920–1970), wrote the classic modern account of Buddhist epistemology (&quot;Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge&quot;, 1963). His student David Kalupahana wrote on the history of Buddhist thought and psychology. Other important Sri Lankan Buddhist thinkers include Ven Ñāṇananda (&quot;Concept and Reality&quot;), Walpola Rahula, Hammalawa Saddhatissa (&quot;Buddhist Ethics&quot;, 1987), Gunapala Dharmasiri (&quot;A Buddhist critique of the Christian concept of God&quot;, 1988), P. D. Premasiri and R. G. de S. Wettimuny.

In 20th-century China, the modernist Taixu (1890–1947) advocated a reform and revival of Buddhism. He promoted an idea of a Buddhist Pure Land, not as a metaphysical place in Buddhist cosmology but as something possible to create here and now in this very world, which could be achieved through a &quot;Buddhism for Human Life&quot; () which was free of supernatural beliefs. Taixu also wrote on the connections between modern science and Buddhism, ultimately holding that &quot;scientific methods can only corroborate the Buddhist doctrine, they can never advance beyond it&quot;. Like Taixu, Yin Shun (1906–2005) advocated a form of Humanistic Buddhism grounded in concern for humanitarian issues, and his students and followers have been influential in promoting Humanistic Buddhism in Taiwan. This period also saw a revival of the study of Weishi (Yogachara), by Yang Rensan (1837–1911), Ouyang Jinwu (1871–1943) and Liang Shuming (1893–1988).

One of Tibetan Buddhism&#x27;s most influential modernist thinkers is Gendün Chöphel (1903–1951), who, according to Donald S. Lopez Jr., &quot;was arguably the most important Tibetan intellectual of the twentieth century.&quot; Gendün Chöphel travelled throughout India with the Indian Buddhist Rahul Sankrityayan and wrote a wide variety of material, including works promoting the importance of modern science to his Tibetan countrymen and also Buddhist philosophical texts such as &quot;Adornment for Nagarjuna&#x27;s Thought&quot;. Another very influential Tibetan Buddhist modernist was Chögyam Trungpa, whose Shambhala Training was meant to be more suitable to modern Western sensitivities by offering a vision of &quot;secular enlightenment&quot;.

In Southeast Asia, thinkers such as Buddhadasa, Thích Nhất Hạnh, Sulak Sivaraksa and Aung San Suu Kyi have promoted a philosophy of socially Engaged Buddhism and have written on the socio-political application of Buddhism. Likewise, Buddhist approaches to economic ethics (Buddhist economics) have been explored in the works of E. F. Schumacher, Prayudh Payutto, Neville Karunatilake and Padmasiri de Silva. The study of the Pali Abhidhamma tradition continued to be influential in Myanmar, where it was developed by monks such as Ledi Sayadaw and Mahasi Sayadaw.

Japanese philosophy was heavily influenced by the work of the Kyoto School which included Kitaro Nishida, Keiji Nishitani, Hajime Tanabe and Masao Abe. These thinkers brought Buddhist ideas in dialogue with Western philosophy, especially European phenomenologists and existentialists. The most important trend in Japanese Buddhist thought after the formation of the Kyoto school is Critical Buddhism, which argues against several Mahayana concepts such as Buddha nature and original enlightenment.

The Japanese Zen Buddhist D.T. Suzuki (1870–1966) was instrumental in bringing Zen Buddhism to the West and his Buddhist modernist works were very influential in the United States. Suzuki&#x27;s worldview was a Zen Buddhism influenced by Romanticism and Transcendentalism, which promoted spiritual freedom as &quot;a spontaneous, emancipatory consciousness that transcends rational intellect and social convention.&quot; This idea of Buddhism influenced the Beat writers, and a contemporary representative of Western Buddhist Romanticism is Gary Snyder. The American Theravada Buddhist monk Thanissaro Bhikkhu has critiqued &#x27;Buddhist Romanticism&#x27; in his writings.

Western Buddhist monastics and priests such as Nanavira Thera, Bhikkhu Bodhi, Nyanaponika Thera, Robert Aitken, Taigen Dan Leighton, and Matthieu Ricard have written texts on Buddhist philosophy. A feature of Buddhist thought in the West has been a desire for dialogue and integration with modern science and psychology, and various modern Buddhists such as B. Alan Wallace, James H. Austin, Mark Epstein and the 14th Dalai Lama have worked and written on this issue.

Another area of convergence has been Buddhism and environmentalism, which is explored in the work of Joanna Macy. Another Western Buddhist philosophical trend has been the project to secularize Buddhism, as seen in the works of Stephen Batchelor.

In the West, Comparative philosophy between Buddhist and Western thought began with the work of Charles A. Moore, who founded the journal Philosophy East and West. Contemporary Western Academics such as Mark Siderits, Jan Westerhoff, Jonardon Ganeri, Miri Albahari, Owen Flanagan, Damien Keown, Tom Tillemans, David Loy, Evan Thompson and Jay Garfield have written various works which interpret Buddhist ideas through Western philosophy.

==Comparison with other philosophies==

Scholars such as Thomas McEvilley, Christopher I. Beckwith, and Adrian Kuzminski have identified cross influences between ancient Buddhism and the ancient Greek philosophy of Pyrrhonism. The Greek philosopher Pyrrho spent 18 months in India as part of Alexander the Great&#x27;s court on Alexander&#x27;s conquest of western India, where ancient biographers say his contact with the gymnosophists caused him to create his philosophy. Because of the high degree of similarity between Nāgārjuna&#x27;s philosophy and Pyrrhonism, particularly the surviving works of Sextus Empiricus, Thomas McEvilley suspects that Nāgārjuna was influenced by Greek Pyrrhonist texts imported into India.

Baruch Spinoza, though he argued for the existence of a permanent reality, asserts that all phenomenal existence is transitory. In his opinion sorrow is conquered &quot;by finding an object of knowledge which is not transient, not ephemeral, but is immutable, permanent, everlasting.&quot; The Buddha taught that the only thing which is eternal is Nirvana. David Hume, after a relentless analysis of the mind, concluded that consciousness consists of fleeting mental states. Hume&#x27;s Bundle theory is a very similar concept to the Buddhist &quot;skandhas&quot;, though his skepticism about causation leads him to opposite conclusions in other areas. Arthur Schopenhauer&#x27;s philosophy parallels Buddhism in his affirmation of asceticism and renunciation as a response to suffering and desire (cf. Schopenhauer&#x27;s &quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot;, 1818).

Ludwig Wittgenstein&#x27;s &quot;language-game&quot; closely parallel the warning that intellectual speculation or papañca is an impediment to understanding, as found in the Buddhist &quot;Parable of the Poison Arrow&quot;. Friedrich Nietzsche, although himself dismissive of Buddhism as yet another nihilism, had a similar impermanent view of the self. Heidegger&#x27;s ideas on being and nothingness have been held by some to be similar to Buddhism today.

An alternative approach to the comparison of Buddhist thought with Western philosophy is to use the concept of the Middle Way in Buddhism as a critical tool for the assessment of Western philosophies. In this way, Western philosophies can be classified in Buddhist terms as eternalist or nihilist. In a Buddhist view, all philosophies are considered non-essential views (ditthis) and not to be clung to.

For his role in &quot;A Simple Plan&quot; (1998) he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. 

Thornton is also known for his film roles in &quot;One False Move&quot; (1992), &quot;Tombstone&quot; (1993), &quot;Dead Man&quot; (1995), &quot;U Turn&quot; (1997), &quot;Primary Colors&quot; (1998), &quot;Armageddon&quot; (1998), &quot;Monster&#x27;s Ball&quot; (2001), &quot;The Man Who Wasn&#x27;t There&quot; (2001), &quot;Intolerable Cruelty&quot; (2003), &quot;Bad Santa&quot; (2003) and &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot; (2004).

Thornton is also known for his roles on television acting in the CBS sitcom &quot;Hearts Afire&quot; from 1992 to 1995. In 2014, he starred as Lorne Malvo in the first season of the FX anthology series &quot;Fargo&quot;, earning a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or Movie and winning a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Miniseries or Television Film. From 2016 to 2021 he played Billy McBride in the Amazon legal drama series, &quot;Goliath&quot;, which earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Drama. In 2024, he began playing the lead role of Tommy Norris in the Paramount+ series &quot;Landman&quot;. 

In addition to film work, Thornton began his career as a singer-songwriter. He has released four solo albums and is the vocalist of the rock band the Boxmasters. Thornton has been vocal about his distaste for celebrity culture, choosing to keep out of the public eye. He has been married six times, including to Angelina Jolie from 2000 to 2003 which received significant media attention.

== Early life ==
Thornton was born on August 4, 1955, in Hot Springs, Arkansas, the son of Virginia Roberta (&quot;née&quot; Faulkner), a self-proclaimed psychic, and William Raymond &quot;Billy Ray&quot; Thornton, a high school history teacher and basketball coach. His brother Jimmy Don (April 1958 – October 1988) wrote a number of songs; Thornton recorded two of them (&quot;Island Avenue&quot; and &quot;Emily&quot;) on his solo albums. He is of English and part Irish descent. He has two other siblings.

Thornton lived in numerous places in Arkansas during his childhood, including Alpine, Malvern, and Mount Holly. He was raised Methodist in an extended family in a shack that had no electricity or plumbing. He attended Malvern High School. Thornton struggled academically in school due to dyslexia, for which he was not conclusively diagnosed until later in life. A good high school baseball player, he tried out for the Kansas City Royals but was released after an injury. He graduated from Malvern in 1973 and spent a short period laying asphalt for the Arkansas State Transportation Department, before attending Henderson State University to pursue a degree in psychology but dropped out after two semesters.

In the mid-1980s Thornton settled in Los Angeles to pursue his career as an actor with future writing partner Tom Epperson. He had a difficult time succeeding as an actor and worked in telemarketing, offshore wind farming, and fast food management between auditioning for acting jobs. He also played the drums and sang with South African rock band Jack Hammer. While working as a waiter for an industry event, he served film director and screenwriter Billy Wilder. He struck up a conversation with Wilder, who advised Thornton to consider a career as a screenwriter.

== Career ==
===1986–1995: Early roles and breakthrough ===

In September 1987, Thornton appeared on stage in a one-act play, &quot;Beethoven Symphonies,&quot; as part of the West Coast Theatre Ensemble in Los Angeles. His first on-screen role was playing a character named Billy Bob in the thriller &quot;Hunter&#x27;s Blood&quot;. He was a stand-in on that film for the whole production, and then appeared in two scenes.

He subsequently appeared in minor roles in the film &quot;South of Reno&quot; and the 1987 &quot;Matlock&quot; episode &quot;The Photographer&quot;. Another one of his early screen roles was as a cast member on the CBS sitcom &quot;Hearts Afire&quot; and in 1989 he appeared as an angry heckler in Adam Sandler&#x27;s debut film &quot;Going Overboard&quot;. He played the role as the villain in 1992&#x27;s &quot;One False Move&quot;, which he also co-wrote. He also had roles in the 1990s films &quot;Indecent Proposal&quot;, &quot;On Deadly Ground&quot;, &quot;Bound by Honor&quot;, and &quot;Tombstone&quot;.

=== 1996–2004: &quot;Sling Blade&quot; and acclaim ===
He went on to write, direct, and star in the 1996 independent film &quot;Sling Blade&quot;. The film, an expansion of the short film &quot;Some Folks Call It a Sling Blade&quot;, introduced the story of a mentally disabled man imprisoned for a gruesome and seemingly inexplicable murder. &quot;Sling Blade&quot; garnered international acclaim. Thornton&#x27;s screenplay earned him an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, a Writers Guild of America Award, and an Edgar Award, while his performance received Oscar and Screen Actors Guild nominations for Best Actor. 

Thornton appeared in several major film roles following the success of &quot;Sling Blade&quot;. In 1998, he portrayed the James Carville-like Richard Jemmons in &quot;Primary Colors&quot;. That same year, he appeared in the disaster film &quot;Armageddon&quot;, and the neo-noir thriller film &quot;A Simple Plan&quot;, the latter of which earned him a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. His screen persona has been described by the press as that of a &quot;tattooed, hirsute man&#x27;s man&quot;.

Thornton adapted the book &quot;All the Pretty Horses&quot; into a 2000 &quot;film of the same name&quot;. The negative experience (he was forced to cut more than an hour of footage) led to his decision to never direct another film; a subsequent release, &quot;Daddy and Them&quot;, had been filmed earlier. Also in 2000, an early script which he and Tom Epperson wrote together was made into &quot;The Gift&quot;. In 2001, he directed &quot;Daddy and Them&quot; while securing starring roles in three Hollywood films: the romantic drama &quot;Monster&#x27;s Ball&quot;, the crime comedy-drama &quot;Bandits&quot;, and the neo-noir film &quot;The Man Who Wasn&#x27;t There&quot;. In 2002, Thornton appeared in Travis Tritt&#x27;s music video for the song &quot;Modern Day Bonnie and Clyde&quot;.
Thornton played a malicious mall Santa in 2003&#x27;s &quot;Bad Santa&quot;, a black comedy on the set of which he admits to getting drunk, and in the same year, portrayed an oil millionaire in the comedy film &quot;Intolerable Cruelty&quot;, and a womanizing President of the United States in the British romantic comedy film &quot;Love Actually&quot;. He stated that, following the success of &quot;Bad Santa&quot;, audiences &quot;like to watch him play that kind of guy&quot; and that &quot;casting directors call him up when they need an asshole&quot;. He referred to this when he said that &quot;it&#x27;s kinda that simple... you know how narrow the imagination in this business can be&quot;. In 2004, Thornton starred as David Crockett in &quot;The Alamo&quot;, and played Coach Gary Gaines in the football drama film &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot;. Also that year, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on October 7.

=== 2005–2013: Career fluctuations ===
He played a baseball coach in the 2005 sports comedy &quot;Bad News Bears&quot;, a remake of the 1976 &quot;film of the same name&quot;. He appeared in the 2006 comic film &quot;School for Scoundrels&quot;. In the film, he plays a self-help doctor, which was written specifically for him. Other films include 2007 drama &quot;The Astronaut Farmer&quot; and the comedy &quot;Mr. Woodcock&quot;, in which he played a sadistic gym teacher. In September 2008, he starred in the action film &quot;Eagle Eye&quot;. He has also expressed an interest in directing another film, possibly a period piece about cave explorer Floyd Collins, based on the book &quot;Trapped!: The Story of Floyd Collins&quot;. In 2011, Thornton voiced Jack in the animated comedy film &quot;Puss in Boots&quot;.

=== Since 2014: &quot;Fargo&quot; and &quot;Goliath&quot; ===
In 2014, he starred as sociopathic hitman Lorne Malvo in the FX miniseries &quot;Fargo&quot;, inspired by the 1996 &quot;film of the same name&quot;, for which he won a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Mini-Series. Thornton made a guest appearance on &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; in 2014, where he played a middle-aged urologist who gets excited about every woman who touches him. That same year, he played a prosecutor in the legal drama &quot;The Judge&quot;. In 2015, Thornton appeared in &quot;Entourage&quot;, the film adaptation of the &quot;television series&quot;.

&quot;Goliath&quot;, a television series by Amazon Studios, featured Thornton as a formerly brilliant and personable lawyer, who is now washed up and alcoholic. It premiered on October 13, 2016, on Amazon Prime Video. &quot;Goliath&quot; was renewed for two additional seasons, with the final season released on September 24, 2021, by Amazon Prime Video. Also in 2016, he reprised his role as the bad mall Santa in &quot;Bad Santa 2&quot;.

In 2017, Thornton starred in the music video &quot;Stand Down&quot; by Kario Salem (musically known as K.O.). It received the Best Music Video award from the Toronto Shorts International Film Festival and has had 13 million views on Facebook and counting.

Since 2024, Thornton has starred in &quot;Landman&quot;, as Tommy Norris, a landman at an oil company.

==Music==
In the 1970s, Thornton was the drummer of a blues rock band named Tres Hombres. Guitarist Billy Gibbons, whose band ZZ Top released an album titled &quot;Tres Hombres&quot; in 1973, referred to the band as &quot;the best little cover band in Texas&quot;, and Thornton bears a tattoo with the band&#x27;s name on it. In 1983, the band released their only studio album, &quot;Gunslinger&quot; on Trigger Records.

In 1985, Thornton joined Piet Botha in the South African rock band Jack Hammer, while Botha worked in Los Angeles. Thornton recorded one studio album with Jack Hammer, &quot;Death of a Gypsy&quot;, which was released in September 1986.

In 2001, Thornton released the album &quot;Private Radio&quot; on Lost Highway Records. Subsequent albums include &quot;The Edge of the World&quot; (2003), &quot;Hobo&quot; (2005) and &quot;Beautiful Door&quot; (2007). He performed the Warren Zevon song &quot;The Wind&quot; on the tribute album &quot;Enjoy Every Sandwich: Songs of Warren Zevon&quot;. Thornton recorded a cover of the Johnny Cash classic &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; with Earl Scruggs, for the &quot;Oxford American&quot; magazine&#x27;s Southern Music CD in 2001. The song also appeared on Scruggs&#x27; 2001 album &quot;Earl Scruggs and Friends&quot;. In 2007, Thornton formed The Boxmasters with J.D. Andrew.

On April 8, 2009, Thornton and his musical group The Boxmasters appeared on the CBC Radio One program &quot;Q&quot;. The appearance was widely criticized and received international attention after Thornton was persistently unintelligible and discourteous to host Jian Ghomeshi. Thornton eventually explained that he had instructed the show&#x27;s producers to not ask questions about his movie career. Ghomeshi had mentioned Thornton&#x27;s acting in the introduction. Thornton had also complained Canadian audiences were like &quot;mashed potatoes without the gravy.&quot; The following night, opening for Willie Nelson at Toronto&#x27;s Massey Hall, Thornton said mid-set he liked Canadians but not Ghomeshi, which was greeted with boos and catcalls. The Boxmasters did not continue the tour in Canada as, according to Thornton, some of the crew and band had the flu.

==Acting credits and accolades ==
Thornton has received the President&#x27;s Award from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy &amp; Horror Films, a Special Achievement Award from the National Board of Review, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He has also been nominated for an Emmy Award, four Golden Globes, and three Screen Actors Guild Awards.

== Personal life ==
===Marriages and family===

Thornton has been married six times. He has four children by three women.

From 1978 to 1980, he was married to Melissa Lee Gatlin, who in her divorce petition cited &quot;incompatibility and adultery on his part&quot;. They had a daughter Amanda (Brumfield), who in 2008 was sentenced to 20 years in prison for the death of her friend&#x27;s one-year-old daughter. The Innocence Project of Florida began representing Amanda in 2015 and claim that the child&#x27;s death was entirely accidental. Amanda was freed in 2020 after a deal was reached with prosecutors prior to an evidentiary hearing to provide medical and scientific evidence of her innocence.

Thornton married actress Toni Lawrence in 1986; they separated the following year and divorced in 1988. From 1990 to 1992, he was married to actress Cynda Williams, who was cast in his writing debut &quot;One False Move&quot; (1992). In 1993, Thornton married &quot;Playboy&quot; model Pietra Dawn Cherniak, with whom he had two sons. The marriage ended in 1997 with Cherniak accusing Thornton of spousal abuse, sometimes in front of his children.

Thornton dated Laura Dern (despite reports, they were never engaged) from 1997 to 1999, but in 2000, he married actress Angelina Jolie, with whom he starred in &quot;Pushing Tin&quot; (1999) and who was nearly 20 years his junior. The marriage became known for the couple&#x27;s eccentric displays of affection, which reportedly included wearing vials of each other&#x27;s blood around their necks; Thornton later clarified that the &quot;vials&quot; were actually two small lockets, each containing only a single drop of blood. Thornton and Jolie announced the adoption of a child from Cambodia in March 2002, but it was later revealed that Jolie had adopted the child as a single parent. They separated in June 2002 and divorced the following year.

In 2003, Thornton began a relationship with makeup effects crew member Connie Angland, with whom he has a daughter. Although he once said that he likely would not marry again since marriage &quot;doesn&#x27;t work&quot; for him, his representatives confirmed that he and Angland were married on October 22, 2014, in Los Angeles.

=== Health problems ===
During his early years in Los Angeles, Thornton was admitted to a hospital and diagnosed with myocarditis, a heart condition thought to be brought on by his diet. He has since said that he follows a vegan diet and is &quot;extremely healthy&quot;, eating no junk food as he is allergic to wheat and dairy.

Thornton has dyslexia and obsessive–compulsive disorder. Various idiosyncratic behaviors have been well documented in interviews with Thornton; among these is a phobia of antique furniture, a disorder shared by Dwight Yoakam&#x27;s character Doyle Hargraves in the Thornton-penned &quot;Sling Blade&quot; and by Thornton&#x27;s own character in the 2001 film &quot;Bandits&quot;. Additionally, he has stated that he has a fear of certain types of silverware, a trait assumed by his character in 2001&#x27;s &quot;Monster&#x27;s Ball&quot;, in which Grotowski insists on a plastic spoon for his daily bowl of ice cream.

In a 2004 interview with &quot;The Independent&quot;, Thornton explained, 

===Interests===
Thornton is a baseball fan, particularly the St. Louis Cardinals. In his movie contracts, one of his conditions is a television in his trailer with a satellite dish so he can watch the Cardinals play. He narrated &quot;The 2006 World Series Film&quot;, the year-end retrospective DVD chronicling the Cardinals&#x27; championship season. He is also a professed fan of the Indianapolis Colts football team.

Thornton is a self-described Brony, a male fan of &quot;My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic&quot;.

Asked about faith, Thornton said &quot;I’m not what you’d call a traditional religious person. We went to the Methodist church—every Sunday you put on your little creepy suit with your clip-on tie and went to church. But it wasn’t like I paid any attention. Hardcore Christians and atheists—they both say they know exactly what the deal is. Anybody who says, &#x27;I know what happens,&#x27; I don&#x27;t believe them. That&#x27;s kind of my religion.&quot;

<doc id="4472" wikidata="Q974411" url="?curid=4472" title="The Big O">
<text>is a Japanese mecha-anime television series created by designer Keiichi Sato and director Kazuyoshi Katayama for Sunrise. The writing staff was assembled by the series&#x27; head writer, Chiaki J. Konaka, who is known for his work on &quot;Serial Experiments Lain&quot; and &quot;Hellsing&quot;. The story takes place forty years after a mysterious occurrence causes the residents of Paradigm City to lose their memories. The series follows Roger Smith, Paradigm City&#x27;s top Negotiator. He provides this &quot;much needed service&quot; with the help of a robot named R. Dorothy Wayneright and his butler Norman Burg. When the need arises, Roger calls upon Big O, a giant relic from the city&#x27;s past.

The television series was designed as a tribute to Japanese and Western shows from the 1960s and 1970s. The series is presented in the style of &quot;film noir&quot; and combines themes of detective fiction and mecha anime. The setpieces are reminiscent of &quot;tokusatsu&quot; productions of the 1950s and 1960s, particularly Toho&#x27;s &quot;kaiju&quot; movies, and the score is an eclectic mix of styles and musical homages.

&quot;The Big O&quot; aired on Wowow satellite television from October 13, 1999, and January 19, 2000. The English-language version premiered on Cartoon Network&#x27;s Toonami on April 2, 2001, and ended on April 23, 2001. Originally planned as a 26-episode series, low viewership in Japan reduced production to the first 13. Positive international reception resulted in a second season consisting of the remaining 13 episodes, co-produced by Cartoon Network, Sunrise, and Bandai Visual. Season two premiered on Japan&#x27;s Sun Television on January 2, 2003, and the American premiere took place seven months later. Following the closure of Bandai Entertainment by parent company Bandai (owned by Bandai Namco Holdings) in 2012, Sunrise announced at Otakon 2013 that Sentai Filmworks acquired both seasons of &quot;The Big O&quot;.

==Synopsis==
===Setting===

&quot;The Big O&quot; is set in the fictional city-state of . The city is located on a seacoast and is surrounded by a vast desert wasteland. The partially domed city is wholly controlled by the monopolistic Paradigm Corporation, resulting in a corporate police state. Paradigm is known as because forty years prior to the story, destroyed the world outside the city and left the survivors without any prior memories. The city is characterized by severe class inequity; the higher-income population resides inside the more pleasant domes, with the remainder left in tenements outside. Residents of the city believe that they are the last survivors of the world and no other nations exist outside the city. Androids and giant robots known as &quot;Megadeus&quot; coexist with the residents of Paradigm City and residents do not find them unusual.

===Plot===
After failing to negotiate with terrorists at the cost of his client&#x27;s life, Roger Smith is obligated to care for Dorothy Wayneright, a young female android. Over the course of the series, Roger Smith continues to accept negotiation work from the residents of Paradigm City, he often leads to uncovering the nature and mystery of Paradigm City and encountering megadeus or other giant enemies that require Big O. Supporting characters are Angel, a mysterious woman in search of memories; Dan Dastun, chief of the military police of Paradigm city and old friend of Roger Smith; and Norman Burg, the butler of Roger Smith and mechanic of Big O.

The main antagonist is Alex Rosewater, chairman of Paradigm City whose goal is to revive the megadeus &quot;Big Fau&quot; in attempts to become the god of Paradigm City. Other recurring antagonists are Jason Beck, criminal and con-artist attempting to humiliate Roger Smith; Schwarzwald, an ex-reporter obsessed with finding the truth of Paradigm City and also pilot of the megadeus &quot;Big Duo&quot;; Vera Ronstadt, leader of a group of foreigners known as the Union searching for memories and revenge against Paradigm City; and Alan Gabriel, a cyborg assassin working for Alex Rosewater and the Union.

The series ends with the awakening of a new megadeus, and the revelation that the world is a simulated reality. A climactic battle ensues between Big O and Big Fau, after which reality is systematically erased by the new megadeus, an incarnation of Angel, recognized as &quot;Big Venus&quot; by Dorothy. Roger implores Angel to &quot;let go of the past&quot; regardless of its existential reality, and focus only on the present and the future. In an isolated control room, the real Angel observes Roger and her past encounters with him on a series of television monitors. On the control panel lies &quot;Metropolis&quot;, a book featured prominently since the thirteenth episode; the cover features an illustration of angel wings and gives the author&#x27;s name as &quot;Angel Rosewater&quot;. Big Venus and Big O physically merge, causing the virtual reality to reset. The final scene shows Roger Smith driving down a restored Paradigm city with Dorothy and Angel observing him from the side of the road.

==Production and release==
Development of the retro-styled series began in 1996. Keiichi Sato came up with the concept of &quot;The Big O&quot;: a giant city-smashing robot, piloted by a man in black, in a Gotham-like environment. He later met up with Kazuyoshi Katayama, who had just finished directing &quot;Those Who Hunt Elves&quot;, and started work on the layouts and character designs. But when things &quot;were about to really start moving,&quot; production on Katayama&#x27;s &quot;Sentimental Journey&quot; began, putting plans on hold. Meanwhile, Sato was heavily involved with his work on &quot;City Hunter&quot;. The initial story idea revolved around a cataclysm (caused by a meteorite impact) that destroyed most of human civilization. The setting would be a city that survived, where the protagonist pilots a giant robot engineered from the meteorite&#x27;s recovered superalloy to battle against the authority in charge of the surviving city.

Sato admits it all started as &quot;a gimmick for a toy&quot; but the representatives at Bandai Hobby Division did not see the same potential. From there on, the dealings would be with Bandai Visual, but Sunrise still needed some safeguards and requested more robots be designed to increase prospective toy sales. In 1999, with the designs complete, Chiaki J. Konaka was brought on as head writer. Among other things, Konaka came up with the idea of &quot;a town without memory&quot; and his writing staff put together the outline for a 26-episodes series. Konaka deliberately chose to present the setting, Paradigm City, as a city of amnesiacs to avoid needing to develop lore for the origin of the show&#x27;s mecha. When Cartoon Network later offered funding for the second season, its representatives requested that the story be satisfactorily finished at the end of this season; this prompted Konaka to continue developing the concept of the amnesiac city as its central theme.

&quot;The Big O&quot; premiered on October 13, 1999, on Wowow. When the production staff was informed the series would be shortened to 13 episodes, the writers decided to end it with a cliffhanger, hoping the next 13 episodes would be picked up. In April 2001, &quot;The Big O&quot; premiered on Cartoon Network&#x27;s Toonami lineup.

The series garnered positive fan response internationally that resulted in a second season co-produced by Cartoon Network and Sunrise. Season two premiered on Japan&#x27;s Sun Television in January 2003, with the American premiere taking place seven months later as an Adult Swim exclusive. The second season would not be seen on Toonami until July 27, 2013, 10 years after it began airing on Adult Swim.

The second season was scripted by Chiaki Konaka with input from the American producers. Cartoon Network raised two requests for the second season: more action and reveal the mystery in the first season, although Kazuyoshi Katayama admitted that he did not intend to reveal it, just to make an anthology of adventures set in the universe. Along with the 13 episodes of season two, Cartoon Network had an option for 26 additional episodes to be written by Konaka, but according to Jason DeMarco, executive producer for season two, the middling ratings and DVD sales in the United States and Japan made any further episodes impossible to be produced.

Following the closure of Bandai Entertainment by parent company in 2012, Sunrise announced at Otakon 2013 that Sentai Filmworks rescued both seasons of &quot;The Big O&quot;. On June 20, 2017, Sentai Filmworks released both seasons on Blu-ray.

&quot;The Big O&quot; was scored by &quot;Geidai&quot; alumnus Toshihiko Sahashi. His composition is richly symphonic and classical, with a number of pieces delving into electronica and jazz. Chosen because of his &quot;frightening amount of musical knowledge about TV dramas overseas,&quot; Sahashi integrates musical homages into the soundtrack. The background music draws from &quot;film noir&quot;, spy films and sci-fi television series like &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. The battle themes are reminiscent of Akira Ifukube&#x27;s compositions for the &quot;Godzilla&quot; series.

The first opening theme is the Queen-influenced &quot;Big-O!&quot;. Composed, arranged and performed by Rui Nagai, the song resembles the theme to the &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; film. The second opening theme is &quot;Respect,&quot; composed by Sahashi. The track is an homage to the music of &quot;UFO&quot;, composed by Barry Gray. In 2007, Rui Nagai composed &quot;Big-O! Show Must Go On,&quot; a 1960s hard rock piece, for Animax&#x27;s reruns of the show; this composition replaced the original opening themes for the Blu-Ray release of the series. The closing theme is the slow love ballad &quot;And Forever...&quot; written by Chie and composed by Ken Shima. The duet is performed by Robbie Danzie and Naoki Takao.

Along with Sahashi&#x27;s original compositions, the soundtrack features Chopin&#x27;s Prelude No. 15 and a jazz saxophone rendition of &quot;Jingle Bells.&quot; The complete score was released in two volumes by Victor Entertainment.

==Design==
&quot;The Big O&quot; is the brainchild of Keiichi Sato and Kazuyoshi Katayama, an homage to the shows they grew up with. The show references the works of &quot;tokusatsu&quot; produced by the Toei Company and Tsuburaya Productions, as well as shows such as &quot;Super Robot Red Baron&quot; and &quot;Super Robot Mach Baron&quot; and &quot;&quot; super robot anime. The series is done in the style of &quot;film noir&quot; and pulp fiction and combines the feel of a detective show with the giant robot genre.

===Style===

&quot;The Big O&quot; shares many of its themes, diction, archetypes and visual iconography with &quot;film noirs&quot; of the 1940s like &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; (1946). The series incorporates the use of long dark shadows in the tradition of &quot;chiaroscuro&quot; and tenebrism. &quot;Film noir&quot; is also known for its use of odd angles, such as Roger&#x27;s low shot introduction in the first episode. &quot;Noir&quot; cinematographers favoured this angle because it made characters almost rise from the ground, giving them dramatic girth and symbolic overtones. Other disorientating devices like dutch angles, mirror reflection and distorting shots are employed throughout the series.

The characters of &quot;The Big O&quot; fit the &quot;noir&quot; and pulp fiction archetypes. Roger Smith is a protagonist in the mold of Chandler&#x27;s Philip Marlowe or Hammett&#x27;s Sam Spade. He is canny and cynical, a disillusioned cop-turned-negotiator whose job has more in common with detective-style work than negotiating. Big Ear is Roger&#x27;s street informant and Dan Dastun is the friend on the police force. The recurring Beck is the imaginative thug compelled by delusions of grandeur while Angel fills the role of the &quot;femme fatale&quot;. Minor characters include crooked cops, corrupt business men and deranged scientists.

The dialogue in the series is recognized for its witty, wry sense of humor. The characters come off as charming and exchange banter not often heard in anime series, as the dialogue has the tendency to be straightforward. The plot is moved along by Roger&#x27;s voice-over narration, a device used in &quot;film noir&quot; to place the viewer in the mind of the protagonist so it can intimately experience the character&#x27;s angst and partly identify with the narrator.

The tall buildings and giant domes create a sense of claustrophobia and paranoia characteristic of the style. The rural landscape, Ailesberry Farm, contrasts Paradigm City. &quot;Noir&quot; protagonists often look for sanctuary in such settings but they just as likely end up becoming a killing ground. The series score is representative of its setting. While no classic &quot;noir&quot; possesses a jazz score, the music could be heard in nightclubs within the films. Roger&#x27;s recurring theme, a lone saxophone accompaniment to the protagonist&#x27;s narration, best exemplifies the &quot;noir&quot; stylings of the series.

Amnesia is a common plot device in &quot;film noir&quot;. Because most of these stories focused on a character proving his innocence, authors up the ante by making him an amnesiac, unable to prove his innocence even to himself.

===Influences===
Before &quot;The Big O&quot;, Sunrise was a subcontractor for Warner Bros. Animation&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, one of the series&#x27; influences. Cartoon Network, under the Toonami flag advertised the series as &quot;One part Bond. One part Bruce Wayne. One part City Smashing Robot.&quot;

Roger Smith is a pastiche of the Bruce Wayne persona and the Batman. The character design resembles Wayne, complete with slicked-back hair and double-breasted business suit. Like Bruce, Roger prides himself in being a rich playboy to the extent that one of his household&#x27;s rules is only women may be let into his mansion without his permission. Like Batman, Roger Smith carries a no-gun policy, albeit more flexible. Unlike the personal motives of the Batman, Roger enforces this rule for &quot;it&#x27;s all part of being a gentleman.&quot; Among Roger&#x27;s gadgetry is the Griffon, a large, black hi-tech sedan comparable to the Batmobile, a grappling cable that shoots out his wristwatch and the giant robot that Angel calls &quot;Roger&#x27;s alter ego.&quot;

&quot;The Big O&quot;&#x27;s cast of supporting characters includes Norman, Roger&#x27;s faithful mechanically inclined butler who fills the role of Alfred Pennyworth; R. Dorothy Wayneright, who plays the role of the sidekick; and Dan Dastun, a good honest cop who, like Jim Gordon, is both a friend to the hero and greatly respected by his comrades.

The other major influence is Mitsuteru Yokoyama&#x27;s &quot;Giant Robo&quot;. Before working on &quot;The Big O&quot;, Kazuyoshi Katayama and other animators worked with Yasuhiro Imagawa on &quot;Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;. The feature, a &quot;retro chic&quot; homage to Yokoyama&#x27;s career, took seven years to produce and suffered low sales and high running costs. Frustrated by the experience, Katayama and his staff put all their efforts into making &quot;good&quot; with &quot;The Big O&quot;.

Like Giant Robo, the megadeuses of &quot;Big O&quot; are metal behemoths. The designs are strange and &quot;more macho than practical,&quot; sporting big stovepipe arms and exposed rivets. Unlike the giants of other mecha series, the megadeuses do not exhibit ninja-like speed nor grace. Instead, the robots are armed with &quot;old school&quot; weaponry such as missiles, piston powered punches, machine guns and laser cannons.

Katayama also cited &quot;Super Robot Red Baron&quot; and &quot;Super Robot Mach Baron&quot; among influences on the inspiration of &quot;The Big O&quot;. Believing that because &quot;Red Baron&quot; had such a low budget and the big fights always happened outside of a city setting, he wanted &quot;Big O&quot; to be the show he felt &quot;Red Baron&quot; could be with a bigger budget. He also spoke of how he first came up with designs for the robots first as if they were making designs to appeal to toy companies, rather than how &quot;Gundam&quot; was created with a toy company wanting an anime to represent their new product. Big O&#x27;s large pumping piston &quot;Sudden Impact&quot; arms, for example, he felt would be cool gimmicks in a toy.

===Publications===

&quot;The Big O&quot; was conceived as a media franchise. To this effect, Sunrise requested a manga be produced along with the animated series. &quot;The Big O&quot; manga started serialization in Kodansha&#x27;s &quot;Magazine Z&quot; in July 1999, three months before the anime premiere. Authored by Hitoshi Ariga, the manga uses Keiichi Sato&#x27;s concept designs in an all-new story. The series ended in October 2001. The issues were later collected in six volumes. The English version of the manga is published by Viz Media.

In anticipation of the broadcast of the second season, a new manga series was published. , authored by Hitoshi Ariga. &quot;Lost Memory&quot; takes place between volumes five and six of the original manga. The issues were serialized in &quot;Magazine Z&quot; from November 2002 to September 2003 and were collected in two volumes. , a novel by Yuki Taniguchi, was released 16 July 2003 by Tokuma Shoten.

&quot;The Big O Visual: The official companion to the TV series&quot; () was published by Futabasha in 2003. The book contains full-color artwork, character bios and concept art, mecha sketches, video/LD/DVD jacket illustrations, history on the making of The Big O, staff interviews, &quot;Roger&#x27;s Monologues&quot; comic strip and the original script for the final episode of the series.

===Audio drama===
&quot;Walking Together On The Yellow Brick Road&quot; was released by Victor Entertainment on 21 September 2000. The drama CD was written by series head writer Chiaki J. Konaka and featured the series&#x27; voice cast. An English translation, written by English dub translator David Fleming, was posted on Konaka&#x27;s website.

===Video games===
The first season of Big O is featured in &quot;Super Robot Wars D&quot; for the Game Boy Advance in 2003. The series, including its second season, is also featured in &quot;Super Robot Wars Z&quot;, released in 2008. &quot;The Big O&quot; became a mainstay of the &quot;Z&quot; games, appearing in each entry of the subseries.

===Toys and model kits===
Bandai released a non-scale model kit of Big O in 2000. Though it was an easy snap-together kit, it required painting, as all of the parts (except the clear orange crown and canopy) were molded in dark gray. The kit included springs that enabled the slide-action Side Piles on the forearms to simulate Big O&#x27;s Sudden Impact maneuver. Also included was an unpainted Roger Smith figure.

PVC figures of Big O and Big Duo (Schwarzwald&#x27;s Megadeus) were sold by Bandai America. Each came with non-poseable figures of Roger, Dorothy and Angel. Mini-figure sets were sold in Japan and America during the run of the second season. The characters included Big O (standard and attack modes), Roger, Dorothy &amp; Norman, Griffon (Roger&#x27;s car), Dorothy-1 (Big O&#x27;s first opponent), Schwarzwald and Big Duo.

In 2009, Bandai released a plastic/diecast figure of the Big O under their Soul of Chogokin line. The figure has the same features as the model kit, but with added detail and accessories. Its design was closely supervised by original designer Keiichi Sato.

In 2011, Max Factory released action figures of Roger and Dorothy through their Figma toyline. Like most Figmas, they are very detailed, articulated and come with accessories and interchangeable faces. In the same year, Max Factory also released a 12-inch, diecast figure of Big O under their Max Gokin line. The figure contained most of the accessories as the Soul of Chogokin figure but also included some others that could be bought separately from the SOC figure, such as the Mobydick (hip) Anchors and Roger Smith&#x27;s car: the Griffon. Like the Soul of Chogokin figure, its design was also supervised by Keiichi Sato. As well, in that same year, Max Factory released soft vinyl figures of Big Duo and Big Fau, in-scale with the Max Gokin Big O. These figures are high in detail but limited in articulation, such as the arms and legs being the only things to move. To date, this is the only action figure of Big Fau.

==Reception==
&quot;The Big O&quot; premiered on October 13, 1999. The show was not a hit in its native Japan, rather it was reduced from an outlined 26 episodes to 13 episodes. Western audiences were more receptive and the series achieved the success its creators were looking for. In an interview with AnimePlay, Keiichi Sato said &quot;This is exactly as we had planned&quot;, referring to the success overseas.

Several words appear constantly in the English-language reviews; adjectives like &quot;hip&quot;, &quot;sleek,&quot; &quot;stylish&quot;,
 &quot;classy&quot;, and, above all, &quot;cool&quot; serve to describe the artwork, the concept, and the series itself. Reviewers have pointed out references and homages to various works of fiction, namely &quot;Batman&quot;, Giant Robo, the works of Isaac Asimov, Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;Metropolis&quot;, James Bond, and &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;. But &quot;while saying that may cause one to think the show is completely derivative&quot;, reads an article at Anime on DVD, &quot;&quot;The Big O&quot; still manages to stand out as something original amongst the other numerous cookie-cutter anime shows.&quot; One reviewer cites the extensive homages as one of the series problems and calls to unoriginality on the creators&#x27; part.

The first season&#x27;s reception was positive. Anime on DVD recommends it as an essential series. Chris Beveridge of the aforementioned site gave an A− to Vols. 1 and 2, and a B+ to Vols. 3 and 4. Mike Toole of Anime Jump gave it 4.5 (out of a possible 5) stars, while the review at the Anime Academy gave it a grade of 83, listing the series&#x27; high points as being &quot;unique&quot;, the characters &quot;interesting,&quot; and the action &quot;nice.&quot; Reviewers, and fans alike, agree the season&#x27;s downfall was the ending, or its lack thereof. The dangling plot threads frustrated the viewers and prompted Cartoon Network&#x27;s involvement in the production of further episodes.

The look and feel of the show received a big enhancement in the second season. This time around, the animation is &quot;near OVA quality&quot; and the artwork &quot;far more lush and detailed.&quot; Also enhanced are the troubles of the first season. The giant robot battles still seem out of place to some, while others praise the &quot;over-the-top-ness&quot; of their execution.

For some reviewers, the second season &quot;doesn&#x27;t quite match the first&quot; addressing to &quot;something&quot; missing in these episodes. Andy Patrizio of IGN points out changes in Roger Smith&#x27;s character, who &quot;lost some of his cool and his very funny side in the second season.&quot; Like a repeat of season one, this season&#x27;s ending is considered its downfall. Chris Beveridge of Anime on DVD wonders if this was head writer &quot;Konaka&#x27;s attempt to throw his hat into the ring for creating one of the most confusing and oblique endings of any series.&quot; Patrizio states &quot;the creators watched &quot;The Truman Show&quot; and &quot;The Matrix&quot; a few times too many.&quot;

Sato, Katayama, Konaka, and Bandai in general received many inquiries from fans in Japan asking for further clarification on the plot and ending. The three directly addressed these questions via an art book and companion to the series in 2004. Katayama describes Paradigm City as the created narrative of Angel, who (alongside Roger Smith only) stands above the story but writes herself a role to play. The narrative provided for civilization to continue in some form, though Angel included a safeguard that would reset the narrative should her identity as the creator ever be discovered by the characters. Having fallen in love with the character of Roger Smith, she inserts herself into the story with conditions designed to bring them together whenever Roger encounters a particularly tough challenge or is investigating mysteries. According to Katayama, her planned narrative collapses when she becomes jealous of Roger&#x27;s affinity for R. Dorothy, culminating in Gordon Rosewater&#x27;s realization that Angel is indeed the creator of Paradigm City. Angel prepares to end the narrative world via piloting Big Venus, which Konaka states will return everything to its destroyed, ruined state it lay in immediately after the cataclysm 40 years ago. Roger however successfully negotiates for her to simply restart the narrative and allow Paradigm City to be reset and continue in some form. Konaka originally wrote the ending to clearly show that Angel changed her role to become Roger&#x27;s assistant, repeating a scene in the first episode where Roger negotiates for the release of Dorothy Waynewright, who is implied to now be human; Katayama changed this to make the ending more ambiguous. In both endings, Paradigm City continues as a city of amnesiacs, despite Gordon Rosewater&#x27;s wishes for Roger to negotiate with the creator to return people&#x27;s memories to them.

The series continues to have a strong cult following into the 2010s. In 2014 BuzzFeed writer Ryan Broderick ranked &quot;The Big O&quot; as one of the best anime series to binge-watch. Dan Casey host of The Nerdist&#x27;s &quot;Dan Cave&quot; stated &quot;The Big O&quot; was the anime series he was most eager to see rebooted or remade, along with &quot;Trigun&quot; and &quot;Soul Eater&quot;. In 2017, Ollie Barder of Forbes wrote, &quot;From the classic and retro styled mecha design of Keiichi Sato to the overall film noir visual tone of the series, The Big O was a fascinating and visually very different kind of show. It also had a fantastic voice cast, with probably the most notable of these being Akiko Yajima as the voice of Roger&#x27;s disapproving android Dorothy.&quot; In 2019, Crunchyroll writer Thomas Zoth ranked &quot;The Big O&quot; as his top 10 anime since the 1990s.

<text>In computing, BIOS (, ; Basic Input/Output System, also known as the System BIOS, ROM BIOS, BIOS ROM or PC BIOS) is a type of firmware used to provide runtime services for operating systems and programs and to perform hardware initialization during the booting process (power-on startup). The firmware comes pre-installed on the computer&#x27;s motherboard.

The name originates from the Basic Input/Output System used in the CP/M operating system in 1975. The BIOS firmware was originally proprietary to the IBM PC; it was reverse engineered by some companies (such as Phoenix Technologies) looking to create compatible systems. The interface of that original system serves as a &quot;de facto&quot; standard.

The BIOS in older PCs initializes and tests the system hardware components (power-on self-test or POST for short), and loads a boot loader from a mass storage device which then initializes a kernel. In the era of DOS, the BIOS provided BIOS interrupt calls for the keyboard, display, storage, and other input/output (I/O) devices that standardized an interface to application programs and the operating system. More recent operating systems do not use the BIOS interrupt calls after startup.

Most BIOS implementations are specifically designed to work with a particular computer or motherboard model, by interfacing with various devices especially system chipset. Originally, BIOS firmware was stored in a ROM chip on the PC motherboard. In later computer systems, the BIOS contents are stored on flash memory so it can be rewritten without removing the chip from the motherboard. This allows easy, end-user updates to the BIOS firmware so new features can be added or bugs can be fixed, but it also creates a possibility for the computer to become infected with BIOS rootkits. Furthermore, a BIOS upgrade that fails could brick the motherboard.

Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) is a successor to the legacy PC BIOS, aiming to address its technical limitations. UEFI firmware may include legacy BIOS compatibility to maintain compatibility with operating systems and option cards that do not support UEFI native operation. Since 2020, all PCs for Intel platforms no longer support Legacy BIOS. The last version of Microsoft Windows to officially support running on PCs which use legacy BIOS firmware is Windows 10 as Windows 11 requires a UEFI-compliant system (except for IoT Enterprise editions of Windows 11 since version 24H2).

== History ==
The term BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) was created by Gary Kildall and first appeared in the CP/M operating system in 1975, describing the machine-specific part of CP/M loaded during boot time that interfaces directly with the hardware. (A CP/M machine usually has only a simple boot loader in its ROM.)

Versions of MS-DOS, PC DOS or DR-DOS contain a file called variously &quot;IO.SYS&quot;, &quot;IBMBIO.COM&quot;, &quot;IBMBIO.SYS&quot;, or &quot;DRBIOS.SYS&quot;; this file is known as the &quot;DOS BIOS&quot; (also known as the &quot;DOS I/O System&quot;) and contains the lower-level hardware-specific part of the operating system. Together with the underlying hardware-specific but operating system-independent &quot;System BIOS&quot;, which resides in ROM, it represents the analogue to the &quot;CP/M BIOS&quot;.

The BIOS originally proprietary to the IBM PC has been reverse engineered by some companies (such as Phoenix Technologies) looking to create compatible systems.

With the introduction of PS/2 machines, IBM divided the System BIOS into real- and protected-mode portions. The real-mode portion was meant to provide backward compatibility with existing operating systems such as DOS, and therefore was named &quot;CBIOS&quot; (for &quot;Compatibility BIOS&quot;), whereas the &quot;ABIOS&quot; (for &quot;Advanced BIOS&quot;) provided new interfaces specifically suited for multitasking operating systems such as OS/2.

== User interface ==
The BIOS of the original IBM PC and XT had no interactive user interface. Error codes or messages were displayed on the screen, or coded series of sounds were generated to signal errors when the power-on self-test (POST) had not proceeded to the point of successfully initializing a video display adapter. Options on the IBM PC and XT were set by switches and jumpers on the main board and on expansion cards. Starting around the mid-1990s, it became typical for the BIOS ROM to include a &quot;BIOS configuration utility&quot; (BCU) or &quot;BIOS setup utility&quot;, accessed at system power-up by a particular key sequence. This program allowed the user to set system configuration options, of the type formerly set using DIP switches, through an interactive menu system controlled through the keyboard. In the interim period, IBM-compatible PCsincluding the IBM ATheld configuration settings in battery-backed RAM and used a bootable configuration program on floppy disk, not in the ROM, to set the configuration options contained in this memory. The floppy disk was supplied with the computer, and if it was lost the system settings could not be changed. The same applied in general to computers with an EISA bus, for which the configuration program was called an EISA Configuration Utility (ECU).

A modern Wintel-compatible computer provides a setup routine essentially unchanged in nature from the ROM-resident BIOS setup utilities of the late 1990s; the user can configure hardware options using the keyboard and video display. The modern Wintel machine may store the BIOS configuration settings in flash ROM, perhaps the same flash ROM that holds the BIOS itself.

== Extensions (option ROMs) ==

Peripheral cards such as hard disk drive host bus adapters and video cards have their own firmware, and BIOS extension option ROM code may be a part of the expansion card firmware; that code provides additional capabilities in the BIOS. Code in option ROMs runs before the BIOS boots the operating system from mass storage. These ROMs typically test and initialize hardware, add new BIOS services, or replace existing BIOS services with their own services. For example, a SCSI controller usually has a BIOS extension ROM that adds support for hard drives connected through that controller. An extension ROM could in principle contain operating system, or it could implement an entirely different boot process such as network booting. Operation of an IBM-compatible computer system can be completely changed by removing or inserting an adapter card (or a ROM chip) that contains a BIOS extension ROM.

The motherboard BIOS typically contains code for initializing and bootstrapping integrated display and integrated storage. The initialization process can involve the execution of code related to the device being initialized, for locating the device, verifying the type of device, then establishing base registers, setting pointers, establishing interrupt vector tables, selecting paging modes which are ways for organizing available registers in devices, setting default values for accessing software routines related to interrupts, and setting the device&#x27;s configuration using default values. In addition, plug-in adapter cards such as SCSI, RAID, network interface cards, and video cards often include their own BIOS (e.g. Video BIOS), complementing or replacing the system BIOS code for the given component. Even devices built into the motherboard can behave in this way; their option ROMs can be a part of the motherboard BIOS.

An add-in card requires an option ROM if the card is not supported by the motherboard BIOS and the card needs to be initialized or made accessible through BIOS services before the operating system can be loaded (usually this means it is required in the boot process). An additional advantage of ROM on some early PC systems (notably including the IBM PCjr) was that ROM was faster than main system RAM. (On modern systems, the case is very much the reverse of this, and BIOS ROM code is usually copied (&quot;shadowed&quot;) into RAM so it will run faster.)

=== Physical placement ===

Option ROMs normally reside on adapter cards. However, the original PC, and perhaps also the PC XT, have a spare ROM socket on the motherboard (the &quot;system board&quot; in IBM&#x27;s terms) into which an option ROM can be inserted, and the four ROMs that contain the BASIC interpreter can also be removed and replaced with custom ROMs which can be option ROMs. The IBM PCjr is unique among PCs in having two ROM cartridge slots on the front. Cartridges in these slots map into the same region of the upper memory area used for option ROMs, and the cartridges can contain option ROM modules that the BIOS would recognize. The cartridges can also contain other types of ROM modules, such as BASIC programs, that are handled differently. One PCjr cartridge can contain several ROM modules of different types, possibly stored together in one ROM chip.

== Operation ==
=== System startup ===
The 8086 and 8088 start at physical address FFFF0h. The 80286 starts at physical address FFFFF0h. The 80386 and later x86 processors start at physical address FFFFFFF0h. When the system is initialized, the first instruction of the BIOS appears at that address.

If the system has just been powered up or the reset button was pressed (&quot;cold boot&quot;), the full power-on self-test (POST) is run. If Ctrl+Alt+Delete was pressed (&quot;warm boot&quot;), a special flag value stored in nonvolatile BIOS memory (&quot;CMOS&quot;) tested by the BIOS allows bypass of the lengthy POST and memory detection.

The POST identifies, tests and initializes system devices such as the CPU, chipset, RAM, motherboard, video card, keyboard, mouse, hard disk drive, optical disc drive and other hardware, including integrated peripherals.

Early IBM PCs had a routine in the POST that would download a program into RAM through the keyboard port and run it. This feature was intended for factory test or diagnostic purposes.

After the motherboard BIOS completes its POST, most BIOS versions search for option ROM modules, also called BIOS extension ROMs, and execute them. The motherboard BIOS scans for extension ROMs in a portion of the &quot;upper memory area&quot; (the part of the x86 real-mode address space at and above address 0xA0000) and runs each ROM found, in order. To discover memory-mapped option ROMs, a BIOS implementation scans the real-mode address space from codice_1 to codice_2 on 2 KB (2,048 bytes) boundaries, looking for a two-byte ROM &quot;signature&quot;: 0x55 followed by 0xAA. In a valid expansion ROM, this signature is followed by a single byte indicating the number of 512-byte blocks the expansion ROM occupies in real memory, and the next byte is the option ROM&#x27;s entry point (also known as its &quot;entry offset&quot;). If the ROM has a valid checksum, the BIOS transfers control to the entry address, which in a normal BIOS extension ROM should be the beginning of the extension&#x27;s initialization routine.

At this point, the extension ROM code takes over, typically testing and initializing the hardware it controls and registering interrupt vectors for use by post-boot applications. It may use BIOS services (including those provided by previously initialized option ROMs) to provide a user configuration interface, to display diagnostic information, or to do anything else that it requires.

An option ROM should normally return to the BIOS after completing its initialization process. Once (and if) an option ROM returns, the BIOS continues searching for more option ROMs, calling each as it is found, until the entire option ROM area in the memory space has been scanned. It is possible that an option ROM will not return to BIOS, pre-empting the BIOS&#x27;s boot sequence altogether.

=== Boot process ===

After the POST completes and, in a BIOS that supports option ROMs, after the option ROM scan is completed and all detected ROM modules with valid checksums have been called, the BIOS calls interrupt 19h to start boot processing. Post-boot, programs loaded can also call interrupt 19h to reboot the system, but they must be careful to disable interrupts and other asynchronous hardware processes that may interfere with the BIOS rebooting process, or else the system may hang or crash while it is rebooting.

When interrupt 19h is called, the BIOS attempts to locate boot loader software on a &quot;boot device&quot;, such as a hard disk, a floppy disk, CD, or DVD. It loads and executes the first boot software it finds, giving it control of the PC.

The BIOS uses the boot devices set in Nonvolatile BIOS memory (CMOS), or, in the earliest PCs, DIP switches. The BIOS checks each device in order to see if it is bootable by attempting to load the first sector (boot sector). If the sector cannot be read, the BIOS proceeds to the next device. If the sector is read successfully, some BIOSes will also check for the boot sector signature 0x55 0xAA in the last two bytes of the sector (which is 512 bytes long), before accepting a boot sector and considering the device bootable.

When a bootable device is found, the BIOS transfers control to the loaded sector. The BIOS does not interpret the contents of the boot sector other than to possibly check for the boot sector signature in the last two bytes. Interpretation of data structures like partition tables and BIOS Parameter Blocks is done by the boot program in the boot sector itself or by other programs loaded through the boot process.

A non-disk device such as a network adapter attempts booting by a procedure that is defined by its option ROM or the equivalent integrated into the motherboard BIOS ROM. As such, option ROMs may also influence or supplant the boot process defined by the motherboard BIOS ROM.

With the El Torito optical media boot standard, the optical drive actually emulates a 3.5&quot; high-density floppy disk to the BIOS for boot purposes. Reading the &quot;first sector&quot; of a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM is not a simply defined operation like it is on a floppy disk or a hard disk. Furthermore, the complexity of the medium makes it difficult to write a useful boot program in one sector. The bootable virtual floppy disk can contain software that provides access to the optical medium in its native format.

If an expansion ROM wishes to change the way the system boots (such as from a network device or a SCSI adapter) in a cooperative way, it can use the &quot;BIOS Boot Specification&quot; (BBS) API to register its ability to do so. Once the expansion ROMs have registered using the BBS APIs, the user can select among the available boot options from within the BIOS&#x27;s user interface. This is why most BBS compliant PC BIOS implementations will not allow the user to enter the BIOS&#x27;s user interface until the expansion ROMs have finished executing and registering themselves with the BBS API.

Also, if an expansion ROM wishes to change the way the system boots unilaterally, it can simply hook interrupt 19h or other interrupts normally called from interrupt 19h, such as interrupt 13h, the BIOS disk service, to intercept the BIOS boot process. Then it can replace the BIOS boot process with one of its own, or it can merely modify the boot sequence by inserting its own boot actions into it, by preventing the BIOS from detecting certain devices as bootable, or both. Before the BIOS Boot Specification was promulgated, this was the only way for expansion ROMs to implement boot capability for devices not supported for booting by the native BIOS of the motherboard.

==== Boot priority ====
The user can select the boot priority implemented by the BIOS. For example, most computers have a hard disk that is bootable, but sometimes there is a removable-media drive that has higher boot priority, so the user can cause a removable disk to be booted.

In most modern BIOSes, the boot priority order can be configured by the user. In older BIOSes, limited boot priority options are selectable; in the earliest BIOSes, a fixed priority scheme was implemented, with floppy disk drives first, fixed disks (i.e., hard disks) second, and typically no other boot devices supported, subject to modification of these rules by installed option ROMs. The BIOS in an early PC also usually would only boot from the first floppy disk drive or the first hard disk drive, even if there were two drives installed.

==== Boot failure ====
On the original IBM PC and XT, if no bootable disk was found, the BIOS would try to start ROM BASIC with the interrupt call to interrupt 18h. Since few programs used BASIC in ROM, clone PC makers left it out; then a computer that failed to boot from a disk would display &quot;No ROM BASIC&quot; and halt (in response to interrupt 18h).

Later computers would display a message like &quot;No bootable disk found&quot;; some would prompt for a disk to be inserted and a key to be pressed to retry the boot process. A modern BIOS may display nothing or may automatically enter the BIOS configuration utility when the boot process fails.

=== Boot environment ===
The environment for the boot program is very simple: the CPU is in real mode and the general-purpose and segment registers are undefined, except SS, SP, CS, and DL. CS:IP always points to physical address codice_3. What values CS and IP actually have is not well defined. Some BIOSes use a CS:IP of codice_4 while others may use codice_5. Because boot programs are always loaded at this fixed address, there is no need for a boot program to be relocatable. DL may contain the drive number, as used with interrupt 13h, of the boot device. SS:SP points to a valid stack that is presumably large enough to support hardware interrupts, but otherwise SS and SP are undefined. (A stack must be already set up in order for interrupts to be serviced, and interrupts must be enabled in order for the system timer-tick interrupt, which BIOS always uses at least to maintain the time-of-day count and which it initializes during POST, to be active and for the keyboard to work. The keyboard works even if the BIOS keyboard service is not called; keystrokes are received and placed in the 15-character type-ahead buffer maintained by BIOS.) The boot program must set up its own stack, because the size of the stack set up by BIOS is unknown and its location is likewise variable; although the boot program can investigate the default stack by examining SS:SP, it is easier and shorter to just unconditionally set up a new stack.

At boot time, all BIOS services are available, and the memory below address codice_6 contains the interrupt vector table. BIOS POST has initialized the system timers, interrupt controller(s), DMA controller(s), and other motherboard/chipset hardware as necessary to bring all BIOS services to ready status. DRAM refresh for all system DRAM in conventional memory and extended memory, but not necessarily expanded memory, has been set up and is running. The interrupt vectors corresponding to the BIOS interrupts have been set to point at the appropriate entry points in the BIOS, hardware interrupt vectors for devices initialized by the BIOS have been set to point to the BIOS-provided ISRs, and some other interrupts, including ones that BIOS generates for programs to hook, have been set to a default dummy ISR that immediately returns. The BIOS maintains a reserved block of system RAM at addresses codice_7 with various parameters initialized during the POST. All memory at and above address codice_8 can be used by the boot program; it may even overwrite itself.

The BIOS ROM is customized to the particular manufacturer&#x27;s hardware, allowing low-level services (such as reading a keystroke or writing a sector of data to diskette) to be provided in a standardized way to programs, including operating systems. For example, an IBM PC might have either a monochrome or a color display adapter (using different display memory addresses and hardware), but a single, standard, BIOS system call may be invoked to display a character at a specified position on the screen in text mode or graphics mode.

The BIOS provides a small library of basic input/output functions to operate peripherals (such as the keyboard, rudimentary text and graphics display functions and so forth). When using MS-DOS, BIOS services could be accessed by an application program (or by MS-DOS) by executing an interrupt 13h interrupt instruction to access disk functions, or by executing one of a number of other documented BIOS interrupt calls to access video display, keyboard, cassette, and other device functions.

Operating systems and executive software that are designed to supersede this basic firmware functionality provide replacement software interfaces to application software. Applications can also provide these services to themselves. This began even in the 1980s under MS-DOS, when programmers observed that using the BIOS video services for graphics display were very slow. To increase the speed of screen output, many programs bypassed the BIOS and programmed the video display hardware directly. Other graphics programmers, particularly but not exclusively in the demoscene, observed that there were technical capabilities of the PC display adapters that were not supported by the IBM BIOS and could not be taken advantage of without circumventing it. Since the AT-compatible BIOS ran in Intel real mode, operating systems that ran in protected mode on 286 and later processors required hardware device drivers compatible with protected mode operation to replace BIOS services.

In modern PCs running modern operating systems (such as Windows and Linux) the BIOS interrupt calls are used only during booting and initial loading of operating systems. Before the operating system&#x27;s first graphical screen is displayed, input and output are typically handled through BIOS. A boot menu such as the textual menu of Windows, which allows users to choose an operating system to boot, to boot into the safe mode, or to use the last known good configuration, is displayed through BIOS and receives keyboard input through BIOS.

Many modern PCs can still boot and run legacy operating systems such as MS-DOS or DR-DOS that rely heavily on BIOS for their console and disk I/O, providing that the system has a BIOS, or a CSM-capable UEFI firmware.

=== Processor microcode updates ===
Intel processors have reprogrammable microcode since the P6 microarchitecture. AMD processors have reprogrammable microcode since the K7 microarchitecture. The BIOS contain patches to the processor microcode that fix errors in the initial processor microcode; microcode is loaded into processor&#x27;s SRAM so reprogramming is not persistent, thus loading of microcode updates is performed each time the system is powered up. Without reprogrammable microcode, an expensive processor swap would be required; for example, the Pentium FDIV bug became an expensive fiasco for Intel as it required a product recall because the original Pentium processor&#x27;s defective microcode could not be reprogrammed. Operating systems can update main processor microcode also.

=== Identification ===
Some BIOSes contain a software licensing description table (SLIC), a digital signature placed inside the BIOS by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), for example Dell. The SLIC is inserted into the ACPI data table and contains no active code.

Computer manufacturers that distribute OEM versions of Microsoft Windows and Microsoft application software can use the SLIC to authenticate licensing to the OEM Windows Installation disk and system recovery disc containing Windows software. Systems with a SLIC can be preactivated with an OEM product key, and they verify an XML formatted OEM certificate against the SLIC in the BIOS as a means of self-activating (see System Locked Preinstallation, SLP). If a user performs a fresh install of Windows, they will need to have possession of both the OEM key (either SLP or COA) and the digital certificate for their SLIC in order to bypass activation. This can be achieved if the user performs a restore using a pre-customised image provided by the OEM. Power users can copy the necessary certificate files from the OEM image, decode the SLP product key, then perform SLP activation manually.

=== Overclocking ===
Some BIOS implementations allow overclocking, an action in which the CPU is adjusted to a higher clock rate than its manufacturer rating for guaranteed capability. Overclocking may, however, seriously compromise system reliability in insufficiently cooled computers and generally shorten component lifespan. Overclocking, when incorrectly performed, may also cause components to overheat so quickly that they mechanically destroy themselves.

=== Modern use ===
Some older operating systems, for example MS-DOS, rely on the BIOS to carry out most input/output tasks within the PC.

Calling real mode BIOS services directly is inefficient for protected mode (and long mode) operating systems. BIOS interrupt calls are not used by modern multitasking operating systems after they initially load.

In the 1990s, BIOS provided some protected mode interfaces for Microsoft Windows and Unix-like operating systems, such as Advanced Power Management (APM), Plug and Play BIOS, Desktop Management Interface (DMI), VESA BIOS Extensions (VBE), e820 and MultiProcessor Specification (MPS). Starting from the year 2000, most BIOSes provide ACPI, SMBIOS, VBE and e820 interfaces for modern operating systems.

After operating systems load, the System Management Mode code is still running in SMRAM. Since 2010, BIOS technology is in a transitional process toward UEFI.

== Configuration ==
=== Setup utility ===
Historically, the BIOS in the IBM PC and XT had no built-in user interface. The BIOS versions in earlier PCs (XT-class) were not software configurable; instead, users set the options via DIP switches on the motherboard. Later computers, including most IBM-compatibles with 80286 CPUs, had a battery-backed nonvolatile BIOS memory (CMOS RAM chip) that held BIOS settings. These settings, such as video-adapter type, memory size, and hard-disk parameters, could only be configured by running a configuration program from a disk, not built into the ROM. A special &quot;reference diskette&quot; was inserted in an IBM AT to configure settings such as memory size.

Early BIOS versions did not have passwords or boot-device selection options. The BIOS was hard-coded to boot from the first floppy drive, or, if that failed, the first hard disk. Access control in early AT-class machines was by a physical keylock switch (which was not hard to defeat if the computer case could be opened). Anyone who could switch on the computer could boot it.

Later, 386-class computers started integrating the BIOS setup utility in the ROM itself, alongside the BIOS code; these computers usually boot into the BIOS setup utility if a certain key or key combination is pressed, otherwise the BIOS POST and boot process are executed.
A modern BIOS setup utility has a text user interface (TUI) or graphical user interface (GUI) accessed by pressing a certain key on the keyboard when the PC starts. Usually, the key is advertised for short time during the early startup, for example &quot;Press DEL to enter Setup&quot;. 

The actual key depends on specific hardware. The settings key is most often Delete (Acer, ASRock, Asus PC, ECS, Gigabyte, MSI, Zotac) and F2 (Asus motherboard, Dell, Lenovo laptop, Origin PC, Samsung, Toshiba), but it can also be F1 (Lenovo desktop) and F10 (HP).

Features present in the BIOS setup utility typically include:

* Configuring, enabling and disabling the hardware components
* Setting the system time
* Setting the boot order
* Setting various passwords, such as a password for securing access to the BIOS user interface and preventing malicious users from booting the system from unauthorized portable storage devices, or a password for booting the system

=== Hardware monitoring ===

A modern BIOS setup screen often features a PC Health Status or a Hardware Monitoring tab, which directly interfaces with a Hardware Monitor chip of the mainboard. This makes it possible to monitor CPU and chassis temperature, the voltage provided by the power supply unit, as well as monitor and control the speed of the fans connected to the motherboard.

Once the system is booted, hardware monitoring and computer fan control is normally done directly by the Hardware Monitor chip itself, which can be a separate chip, interfaced through I²C or SMBus, or come as a part of a Super I/O solution, interfaced through Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) or Low Pin Count (LPC). Some operating systems, like NetBSD with envsys and OpenBSD with sysctl hw.sensors, feature integrated interfacing with hardware monitors.

However, in some circumstances, the BIOS also provides the underlying information about hardware monitoring through ACPI, in which case, the operating system may be using ACPI to perform hardware monitoring.

=== Reprogramming ===

In modern PCs the BIOS is stored in rewritable EEPROM or NOR flash memory, allowing the contents to be replaced and modified. This rewriting of the contents is sometimes termed &quot;flashing.&quot; It can be done by a special program, usually provided by the system&#x27;s manufacturer, or at POST, with a BIOS image in a hard drive or USB flash drive. A file containing such contents is sometimes termed &quot;a BIOS image&quot;. A BIOS might be reflashed in order to upgrade to a newer version to fix bugs or provide improved performance or to support newer hardware. Some computers also support updating the BIOS via an update floppy disk or a special partition on the hard drive.

== Hardware ==

The original IBM PC BIOS (and cassette BASIC) was stored on mask-programmed read-only memory (ROM) chips in sockets on the motherboard. ROMs could be replaced, but not altered, by users. To allow for updates, many compatible computers used re-programmable BIOS memory devices such as EPROM, EEPROM and later flash memory (usually NOR flash) devices. According to Robert Braver, the president of the BIOS manufacturer Micro Firmware, Flash BIOS chips became common around 1995 because the electrically erasable PROM (EEPROM) chips are cheaper and easier to program than standard ultraviolet erasable PROM (EPROM) chips. Flash chips are programmed (and re-programmed) in-circuit, while EPROM chips need to be removed from the motherboard for re-programming. BIOS versions are upgraded to take advantage of newer versions of hardware and to correct bugs in previous revisions of BIOSes.

Beginning with the IBM AT, PCs supported a hardware clock settable through BIOS. It had a century bit which allowed for manually changing the century when the year 2000 happened. Most BIOS revisions created in 1995 and nearly all BIOS revisions in 1997 supported the year 2000 by setting the century bit automatically when the clock rolled past midnight, 31 December 1999.

The first flash chips were attached to the ISA bus. Starting in 1998, the BIOS flash moved to the LPC bus, following a new standard implementation known as &quot;firmware hub&quot; (FWH). In 2005, the BIOS flash memory moved to the SPI bus.

The size of the BIOS, and the capacity of the ROM, EEPROM, or other media it may be stored on, has increased over time as new features have been added to the code; BIOS versions now exist with sizes up to 32 megabytes. For contrast, the original IBM PC BIOS was contained in an 8 KB mask ROM. Some modern motherboards are including even bigger NAND flash memory ICs on board which are capable of storing whole compact operating systems, such as some Linux distributions. For example, some ASUS notebooks included Splashtop OS embedded into their NAND flash memory ICs. However, the idea of including an operating system along with BIOS in the ROM of a PC is not new; in the 1980s, Microsoft offered a ROM option for MS-DOS, and it was included in the ROMs of some PC clones such as the Tandy 1000 HX.

Another type of firmware chip was found on the IBM PC AT and early compatibles. In the AT, the keyboard interface was controlled by a microcontroller with its own programmable memory. On the IBM AT, that was a 40-pin socketed device, while some manufacturers used an EPROM version of this chip which resembled an EPROM. This controller was also assigned the A20 gate function to manage memory above the one-megabyte range; occasionally an upgrade of this &quot;keyboard BIOS&quot; was necessary to take advantage of software that could use upper memory. 

The BIOS may contain components such as the Memory Reference Code (MRC), which is responsible for the memory initialization (e.g. SPD and memory timings initialization).

Modern BIOS includes
Intel Management Engine or AMD Platform Security Processor firmware.

== Vendors and products ==
IBM published the entire listings of the BIOS for its original PC, PC XT, PC AT, and other contemporary PC models, in an appendix of the &quot;IBM PC Technical Reference Manual&quot; for each machine type. The effect of the publication of the BIOS listings is that anyone can see exactly what a definitive BIOS does and how it does it.
In May 1984, Phoenix Software Associates released its first ROM-BIOS. This BIOS enabled OEMs to build essentially fully compatible clones without having to reverse-engineer the IBM PC BIOS themselves, as Compaq had done for the Portable; it also helped fuel the growth in the PC-compatibles industry and sales of non-IBM versions of DOS. The first American Megatrends (AMI) BIOS was released in 1986.

New standards grafted onto the BIOS are usually without complete public documentation or any BIOS listings. As a result, it is not as easy to learn the intimate details about the many non-IBM additions to BIOS as about the core BIOS services.

Many PC motherboard suppliers licensed the BIOS &quot;core&quot; and toolkit from a commercial third party, known as an &quot;independent BIOS vendor&quot; or IBV. The motherboard manufacturer then customized this BIOS to suit its own hardware. For this reason, updated BIOSes are normally obtained directly from the motherboard manufacturer. Major IBVs included American Megatrends (AMI), Insyde Software, Phoenix Technologies, and Byosoft. Microid Research and Award Software were acquired by Phoenix Technologies in 1998; Phoenix later phased out the Award brand name (although Award Software is still credited in newer AwardBIOS versions and in UEFI firmwares). General Software, which was also acquired by Phoenix in 2007, sold BIOS for embedded systems based on Intel processors.

SeaBIOS is an open-source BIOS implementation.

== Open-source BIOS replacements ==
The open-source community increased their effort to develop a replacement for proprietary BIOSes and their future incarnations with an open-sourced counterparts. Open Firmware was an early attempt to make an open specification for boot firmware. It was initially endorsed by IEEE in its &quot;IEEE 1275-1994&quot; standard but was withdrawn in 2005. Later examples include the OpenBIOS, coreboot and libreboot projects. AMD provided product specifications for some chipsets using coreboot, and Google is sponsoring the project. Motherboard manufacturer Tyan offers coreboot next to the standard BIOS with their Opteron line of motherboards.

== Security ==


EEPROM and flash memory chips are advantageous because they can be easily updated by the user; it is customary for hardware manufacturers to issue BIOS updates to upgrade their products, improve compatibility and remove bugs. However, this advantage had the risk that an improperly executed or aborted BIOS update could render the computer or device unusable. To avoid these situations, more recent BIOSes use a &quot;boot block&quot;; a portion of the BIOS which runs first and must be updated separately. This code verifies if the rest of the BIOS is intact (using hash checksums or other methods) before transferring control to it. If the boot block detects any corruption in the main BIOS, it will typically warn the user that a recovery process must be initiated by booting from removable media (floppy, CD or USB flash drive) so the user can try flashing the BIOS again. Some motherboards have a &quot;backup&quot; BIOS (sometimes referred to as DualBIOS boards) to recover from BIOS corruptions.

There are at least five known viruses that attack the BIOS. Two of which were for demonstration purposes. The first one found in the wild was &quot;Mebromi&quot;, targeting Chinese users.

The first BIOS virus was BIOS Meningitis, which instead of erasing BIOS chips it infected them. BIOS Meningitis was relatively harmless, compared to a virus like CIH.

The second BIOS virus was CIH, also known as the &quot;Chernobyl Virus&quot;, which was able to erase flash ROM BIOS content on compatible chipsets. CIH appeared in mid-1998 and became active in April 1999. Often, infected computers could no longer boot, and people had to remove the flash ROM IC from the motherboard and reprogram it. CIH targeted the then-widespread Intel i430TX motherboard chipset and took advantage of the fact that the Windows 9x operating systems, also widespread at the time, allowed direct hardware access to all programs.

Modern systems are not vulnerable to CIH because of a variety of chipsets being used which are incompatible with the Intel i430TX chipset, and also other flash ROM IC types. There is also extra protection from accidental BIOS rewrites in the form of boot blocks which are protected from accidental overwrite or dual and quad BIOS equipped systems which may, in the event of a crash, use a backup BIOS. Also, all modern operating systems such as FreeBSD, Linux, macOS, Windows NT-based Windows OS like Windows 2000, Windows XP and newer, do not allow user-mode programs to have direct hardware access using a hardware abstraction layer.

As a result, as of 2008, CIH has become essentially harmless, at worst causing annoyance by infecting executable files and triggering antivirus software. Other BIOS viruses remain possible, however; since most Windows home users without Windows Vista/7&#x27;s UAC run all applications with administrative privileges, a modern CIH-like virus could in principle still gain access to hardware without first using an exploit. The operating system OpenBSD prevents all users from having this access and the grsecurity patch for the Linux kernel also prevents this direct hardware access by default, the difference being an attacker requiring a much more difficult kernel level exploit or reboot of the machine.

The third BIOS virus was a technique presented by John Heasman, principal security consultant for UK-based Next-Generation Security Software. In 2006, at the Black Hat Security Conference, he showed how to elevate privileges and read physical memory, using malicious procedures that replaced normal ACPI functions stored in flash memory.

The fourth BIOS virus was a technique called &quot;Persistent BIOS infection.&quot; It appeared in 2009 at the CanSecWest Security Conference in Vancouver, and at the SyScan Security Conference in Singapore. Researchers Anibal Sacco and Alfredo Ortega, from Core Security Technologies, demonstrated how to insert malicious code into the decompression routines in the BIOS, allowing for nearly full control of the PC at start-up, even before the operating system is booted. The proof-of-concept does not exploit a flaw in the BIOS implementation, but only involves the normal BIOS flashing procedures. Thus, it requires physical access to the machine, or for the user to be root. Despite these requirements, Ortega underlined the profound implications of his and Sacco&#x27;s discovery: &quot;We can patch a driver to drop a fully working rootkit. We even have a little code that can remove or disable antivirus.&quot;

Mebromi is a trojan which targets computers with AwardBIOS, Microsoft Windows, and antivirus software from two Chinese companies: Rising Antivirus and Jiangmin KV Antivirus. Mebromi installs a rootkit which infects the Master boot record.

In a December 2013 interview with &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, Deborah Plunkett, Information Assurance Director for the US National Security Agency claimed the NSA had uncovered and thwarted a possible BIOS attack by a foreign nation state, targeting the US financial system. The program cited anonymous sources alleging it was a Chinese plot. However follow-up articles in &quot;The Guardian,&quot; &quot;The Atlantic,&quot; &quot;Wired&quot; and &quot;The Register&quot; refuted the NSA&#x27;s claims.

Newer Intel platforms have Intel Boot Guard (IBG) technology enabled, this technology will check the BIOS digital signature at startup, and the IBG public key is fused into the PCH. End users can&#x27;t disable this function.

== Alternatives and successors ==
Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) supplements the BIOS in many new machines. Initially written for the Intel Itanium architecture, UEFI is now available for x86 and Arm platforms; the specification development is driven by the Unified EFI Forum, an industry special interest group. EFI booting has been supported in only Microsoft Windows versions supporting GPT, the Linux kernel 2.6.1 and later, and macOS on Intel-based Macs. , new PC hardware predominantly ships with UEFI firmware. The architecture of the rootkit safeguard can also prevent the system from running the user&#x27;s own software changes, which makes UEFI controversial as a legacy BIOS replacement in the open hardware community. Also, Windows 11 requires UEFI to boot, with the exception of IoT Enterprise editions of Windows 11. UEFI is required for devices shipping with Windows 8 and above.

Other alternatives to the functionality of the &quot;Legacy BIOS&quot; in the x86 world include coreboot and libreboot.

Some servers and workstations use a platform-independent Open Firmware (IEEE-1275) based on the Forth programming language; it is included with Sun&#x27;s SPARC computers, IBM&#x27;s RS/6000 line, and other PowerPC systems such as the CHRP motherboards, along with the x86-based OLPC XO-1.

As of at least 2015, Apple has removed legacy BIOS support from the UEFI monitor in Intel-based Macs. As such, the BIOS utility no longer supports the legacy option, and prints &quot;Legacy mode not supported on this system&quot;.

In 2017, Intel announced that it would remove legacy BIOS support by 2020. Since 2019, new Intel platform OEM PCs no longer support the legacy option.

<doc id="4474" wikidata="Q46202" url="?curid=4474" title="Bose–Einstein condensate">
<text>In condensed matter physics, a Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC) is a state of matter that is typically formed when a gas of bosons at very low densities is cooled to temperatures very close to absolute zero, i.e., . Under such conditions, a large fraction of bosons occupy the lowest quantum state, at which microscopic quantum-mechanical phenomena, particularly wavefunction interference, become apparent macroscopically. 
More generally, condensation refers to the appearance of macroscopic occupation of one or several states: for example, in BCS theory, a superconductor is a condensate of Cooper pairs. As such, condensation can be associated with phase transition, and the macroscopic occupation of the state is the order parameter.

Bose–Einstein condensate was first predicted, generally, in 1924–1925 by Albert Einstein, crediting a pioneering paper by Satyendra Nath Bose on the new field now known as quantum statistics. In 1995, the Bose–Einstein condensate was created by Eric Cornell and Carl Wieman of the University of Colorado Boulder using rubidium atoms; later that year, Wolfgang Ketterle of MIT produced a BEC using sodium atoms. In 2001 Cornell, Wieman, and Ketterle shared the Nobel Prize in Physics &quot;for the achievement of Bose–Einstein condensation in dilute gases of alkali atoms, and for early fundamental studies of the properties of the condensates&quot;.

== History ==
Bose first sent a paper to Einstein on the quantum statistics of light quanta (now called photons), in which he derived Planck&#x27;s quantum radiation law without any reference to classical physics. Einstein was impressed, translated the paper himself from English to German and submitted it for Bose to the &quot;Zeitschrift für Physik&quot;, which published it in 1924. (The Einstein manuscript, once believed to be lost, was found in a library at Leiden University in 2005.) Einstein then extended Bose&#x27;s ideas to matter in two other papers. The result of their efforts is the concept of a Bose gas, governed by Bose–Einstein statistics, which describes the statistical distribution of identical particles with integer spin, now called bosons. Bosons are allowed to share a quantum state. Einstein proposed that cooling bosonic atoms to a very low temperature would cause them to fall (or &quot;condense&quot;) into the lowest accessible quantum state, resulting in a new form of matter. Bosons include the photon, polaritons, magnons, some atoms and molecules (depending on the number of nucleons, see #Isotopes) such as atomic hydrogen, helium-4, lithium-7, rubidium-87 or strontium-84.

In 1938, Fritz London proposed the BEC as a mechanism for superfluidity in and superconductivity.

The quest to produce a Bose–Einstein condensate in the laboratory was stimulated by a paper published in 1976 by two program directors at the National Science Foundation (William Stwalley and Lewis Nosanow), proposing to use spin-polarized atomic hydrogen to produce a gaseous BEC. This led to the immediate pursuit of the idea by four independent research groups; these were led by Isaac Silvera (University of Amsterdam), Walter Hardy (University of British Columbia), Thomas Greytak (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and David Lee (Cornell University). However, cooling atomic hydrogen turned out to be technically difficult, and Bose-Einstein condensation of atomic hydrogen was only realized in 1998.

On 5 June 1995, the first gaseous condensate was produced by Eric Cornell and Carl Wieman at the University of Colorado at Boulder NIST–JILA lab, in a gas of rubidium atoms cooled to 170 nanokelvins (nK). Shortly thereafter, Wolfgang Ketterle at MIT produced a Bose–Einstein Condensate in a gas of sodium atoms. For their achievements Cornell, Wieman, and Ketterle received the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physics. Bose-Einstein condensation of alkali gases is easier because they can be pre-cooled with laser cooling techniques, unlike atomic hydrogen at the time, which give a significant head start when performing the final forced evaporative cooling to cross the condensation threshold. These early studies founded the field of ultracold atoms, and hundreds of research groups around the world now routinely produce BECs of dilute atomic vapors in their labs.

Since 1995, many other atomic species have been condensed (see #Isotopes), and BECs have also been realized using molecules, polaritons, and other quasi-particles. BECs of photons can be made, for example, in dye microcavites with wavelength-scale mirror separation, forming a two-dimensional harmonically confined photon gas with tunable chemical potential. BEC of plasmonic quasiparticles (plasmon-exciton polaritons) has been realized in periodic arrays of metal nanoparticles overlaid with dye molecules, exhibiting ultrafast sub-picosecond dynamics and long-range correlations.

== Critical temperature ==
This transition to BEC occurs below a critical temperature, which for a uniform three-dimensional gas consisting of non-interacting particles with no apparent internal degrees of freedom is given by
: formula_1
where:
: formula_2 is the critical temperature,
: formula_3 is the particle density,
: formula_4 is the mass per boson,
: formula_5 is the reduced Planck constant,
: formula_6 is the Boltzmann constant,
: formula_7 is the Riemann zeta function (formula_8).

Interactions shift the value, and the corrections can be calculated by mean-field theory.
This formula is derived from finding the gas degeneracy in the Bose gas using Bose–Einstein statistics.

The critical temperature depends on the density. A more concise and experimentally relevant condition involves the phase-space density formula_9, where
: formula_10
is the thermal de Broglie wavelength. It is a dimensionless quantity. The transition to BEC occurs when the phase-space density is greater than critical value:
: formula_11
in 3D uniform space. This is equivalent to the above condition on the temperature. In a 3D harmonic potential, the critical value is instead
: formula_12
where formula_3 has to be understood as the peak density.

== Derivation ==

=== Ideal Bose gas ===
For an ideal Bose gas we have the equation of state

: formula_14

where formula_15 is the per-particle volume, formula_16 is the thermal wavelength, formula_17 is the fugacity, and
: formula_18

It is noticeable that formula_19 is a monotonically growing function of formula_17 in formula_21, which are the only values for which the series converge.
Recognizing that the second term on the right-hand side contains the expression for the average occupation number of the fundamental state formula_22, the equation of state can be rewritten as

: formula_23

Because the left term on the second equation must always be positive, formula_24, and because formula_25, a stronger condition is

: formula_26

which defines a transition between a gas phase and a condensed phase. On the critical region it is possible to define a critical temperature and thermal wavelength:

: formula_27

: formula_28

recovering the value indicated on the previous section. The critical values are such that if formula_29 or formula_30, we are in the presence of a Bose–Einstein condensate.
Understanding what happens with the fraction of particles on the fundamental level is crucial. As so, write the equation of state for formula_31, obtaining

: formula_32 and equivalently formula_33

So, if formula_34, the fraction formula_35, and if formula_36, the fraction formula_37. At temperatures near to absolute 0, particles tend to condense in the fundamental state, which is the state with momentum formula_38.

== Experimental observation ==

=== Superfluid helium-4 ===

In 1938, Pyotr Kapitsa, John Allen and Don Misener discovered that helium-4 became a new kind of fluid, now known as a superfluid, at temperatures less than 2.17 K (the lambda point). Superfluid helium has many unusual properties, including zero viscosity (the ability to flow without dissipating energy) and the existence of quantized vortices. It was quickly believed that the superfluidity was due to partial Bose–Einstein condensation of the liquid. In fact, many properties of superfluid helium also appear in gaseous condensates created by Cornell, Wieman and Ketterle (see below). Superfluid helium-4 is a liquid rather than a gas, which means that the interactions between the atoms are relatively strong; the original theory of Bose–Einstein condensation must be heavily modified in order to describe it. Bose–Einstein condensation remains, however, fundamental to the superfluid properties of helium-4. Note that helium-3, a fermion, also enters a superfluid phase (at a much lower temperature) which can be explained by the formation of bosonic Cooper pairs of two atoms (see also fermionic condensate).

=== Dilute atomic gases ===
The first &quot;pure&quot; Bose–Einstein condensate was created by Eric Cornell, Carl Wieman, and co-workers at JILA on 5 June 1995. They cooled a dilute vapor of approximately two thousand rubidium-87 atoms to below 170 nK using a combination of laser cooling (a technique that won its inventors Steven Chu, Claude Cohen-Tannoudji, and William D. Phillips the 1997 Nobel Prize in Physics) and magnetic evaporative cooling. About four months later, an independent effort led by Wolfgang Ketterle at MIT condensed sodium-23. Ketterle&#x27;s condensate had a hundred times more atoms, allowing important results such as the observation of quantum mechanical interference between two different condensates. Cornell, Wieman and Ketterle won the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physics for their achievements.

A group led by Randall Hulet at Rice University announced a condensate of lithium atoms only one month following the JILA work. Lithium has attractive interactions, causing the condensate to be unstable and collapse for all but a few atoms. Hulet&#x27;s team subsequently showed the condensate could be stabilized by confinement quantum pressure for up to about 1000 atoms. Various isotopes have since been condensed.

==== Velocity-distribution data graph ====
In the image accompanying this article, the velocity-distribution data indicates the formation of a Bose–Einstein condensate out of a gas of rubidium atoms. The false colors indicate the number of atoms at each velocity, with red being the fewest and white being the most. The areas appearing white and light blue are at the lowest velocities. The peak is not infinitely narrow because of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: spatially confined atoms have a minimum width velocity distribution. This width is given by the curvature of the magnetic potential in the given direction. More tightly confined directions have bigger widths in the ballistic velocity distribution. This anisotropy of the peak on the right is a purely quantum-mechanical effect and does not exist in the thermal distribution on the left. This graph served as the cover design for the 1999 textbook &quot;Thermal Physics&quot; by Ralph Baierlein.

=== Quasiparticles ===
Bose–Einstein condensation also applies to quasiparticles in solids. Magnons, excitons, and polaritons have integer spin which means they are bosons that can form condensates.

Magnons, electron spin waves, can be controlled by a magnetic field. Densities from the limit of a dilute gas to a strongly interacting Bose liquid are possible. Magnetic ordering is the analog of superfluidity. In 1999 condensation was demonstrated in antiferromagnetic , at temperatures as great as 14 K. The high transition temperature (relative to atomic gases) is due to the magnons&#x27; small mass (near that of an electron) and greater achievable density. In 2006, condensation in a ferromagnetic yttrium-iron-garnet thin film was seen even at room temperature, with optical pumping.

Excitons, electron-hole pairs, were predicted to condense at low temperature and high density by Boer et al., in 1961. Bilayer system experiments first demonstrated condensation in 2003, by Hall voltage disappearance. Fast optical exciton creation was used to form condensates in sub-kelvin in 2005 on.

Polariton condensation was first detected for exciton-polaritons in a quantum well microcavity kept at 5 K. Quasiparticle BECs have been achieved at room-temperature, for example, in microcavity-coupled organic semiconductors and plasmon-exciton polaritons in periodic arrays of metal nanoparticles coupled to dye molecules.

=== In zero gravity ===
In June 2020, the Cold Atom Laboratory experiment on board the International Space Station successfully created a BEC of rubidium atoms and observed them for over a second in free-fall. Although initially just a proof of function, early results showed that, in the microgravity environment of the ISS, about half of the atoms formed into a magnetically insensitive halo-like cloud around the main body of the BEC.

== Models ==

=== Bose Einstein&#x27;s non-interacting gas ===

Consider a collection of &quot;N&quot; non-interacting particles, which can each be in one of two quantum states, formula_39 and formula_40. If the two states are equal in energy, each different configuration is equally likely.

If we can tell which particle is which, there are formula_41 different configurations, since each particle can be in formula_39 or formula_40 independently. In almost all of the configurations, about half the particles are in formula_39 and the other half in formula_40. The balance is a statistical effect: the number of configurations is largest when the particles are divided equally.

If the particles are indistinguishable, however, there are only formula_46 different configurations. If there are formula_47 particles in state formula_40, there are formula_49 particles in state formula_39. Whether any particular particle is in state formula_39 or in state formula_40 cannot be determined, so each value of formula_47 determines a unique quantum state for the whole system.

Suppose now that the energy of state formula_40 is slightly greater than the energy of state formula_39 by an amount formula_56. At temperature formula_57, a particle will have a lesser probability to be in state formula_40 by formula_59. In the distinguishable case, the particle distribution will be biased slightly towards state formula_39. But in the indistinguishable case, since there is no statistical pressure toward equal numbers, the most-likely outcome is that most of the particles will collapse into state formula_39.

In the distinguishable case, for large &quot;N&quot;, the fraction in state formula_39 can be computed. It is the same as flipping a coin with probability proportional to formula_63 to land tails.

In the indistinguishable case, each value of formula_47 is a single state, which has its own separate Boltzmann probability. So the probability distribution is exponential:

:formula_65

For large formula_66, the normalization constant formula_67 is formula_68. The expected total number of particles not in the lowest energy state, in the limit that formula_69, is equal to
: formula_70
It does not grow when &quot;N&quot; is large; it just approaches a constant. This will be a negligible fraction of the total number of particles. So a collection of enough Bose particles in thermal equilibrium will mostly be in the ground state, with only a few in any excited state, no matter how small the energy difference.

Consider now a gas of particles, which can be in different momentum states labeled formula_71. If the number of particles is less than the number of thermally accessible states, for high temperatures and low densities, the particles will all be in different states. In this limit, the gas is classical. As the density increases or the temperature decreases, the number of accessible states per particle becomes smaller, and at some point, more particles will be forced into a single state than the maximum allowed for that state by statistical weighting. From this point on, any extra particle added will go into the ground state.

To calculate the transition temperature at any density, integrate, over all momentum states, the expression for maximum number of excited particles, formula_72:

:formula_73
:formula_74

When the integral (also known as Bose–Einstein integral) is evaluated with factors of formula_75 and formula_5 restored by dimensional analysis, it gives the critical temperature formula of the preceding section. Therefore, this integral defines the critical temperature and particle number corresponding to the conditions of negligible chemical potential formula_77. In Bose–Einstein statistics distribution, formula_77 is actually still nonzero for BECs; however, formula_77 is less than the ground state energy. Except when specifically talking about the ground state, formula_77 can be approximated for most energy or momentum states as formula_81.

=== Bogoliubov theory for weakly interacting gas ===
Nikolay Bogoliubov considered perturbations on the limit of dilute gas, finding a finite pressure at zero temperature and positive chemical potential. This leads to corrections for the ground state. The Bogoliubov state has pressure formula_82: formula_83.

The original interacting system can be converted to a system of non-interacting particles with a dispersion law.

=== Gross–Pitaevskii equation ===
In some simplest cases, the state of condensed particles can be described with a nonlinear Schrödinger equation, also known as Gross–Pitaevskii or Ginzburg–Landau equation. The validity of this approach is actually limited to the case of ultracold temperatures, which fits well for the most alkali atoms experiments.

This approach originates from the assumption that the state of the BEC can be described by the unique wavefunction of the condensate formula_84. For a system of this nature, formula_85 is interpreted as the particle density, so the total number of atoms is formula_86

Provided essentially all atoms are in the condensate (that is, have condensed to the ground state), and treating the bosons using mean-field theory, the energy (E) associated with the state formula_84 is:

:formula_88

Minimizing this energy with respect to infinitesimal variations in formula_84, and holding the number of atoms constant, yields the Gross–Pitaevski equation (GPE) (also a non-linear Schrödinger equation):

:formula_90

where:

In the case of zero external potential, the dispersion law of interacting Bose–Einstein-condensed particles is given by so-called Bogoliubov spectrum (for formula_91):

:formula_92

The Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) provides a relatively good description of the behavior of atomic BEC&#x27;s. However, GPE does not take into account the temperature dependence of dynamical variables, and is therefore valid only for formula_91.
It is not applicable, for example, for the condensates of excitons, magnons and photons, where the critical temperature is comparable to room temperature.

==== Numerical solution ====
The Gross-Pitaevskii equation is a partial differential equation in space and time variables. Usually it does not have analytic solution and
different numerical methods, such as split-step
Crank–Nicolson
and Fourier spectral methods, are used for its solution. There are different Fortran and C programs for its solution for contact interaction
and long-range dipolar interaction which can be freely used.

==== Weaknesses of Gross–Pitaevskii model ====
The Gross–Pitaevskii model of BEC is a physical approximation valid for certain classes of BECs. By construction, the GPE uses the following simplifications: it assumes that interactions between condensate particles are of the contact two-body type and also neglects anomalous contributions to self-energy. These assumptions are suitable mostly for the dilute three-dimensional condensates. If one relaxes any of these assumptions, the equation for the condensate wavefunction acquires the terms containing higher-order powers of the wavefunction. Moreover, for some physical systems the amount of such terms turns out to be infinite, therefore, the equation becomes essentially non-polynomial. The examples where this could happen are the Bose–Fermi composite condensates, effectively lower-dimensional condensates, and dense condensates and superfluid clusters and droplets. It is found that one has to go beyond the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. For example, the logarithmic term formula_94 found in the Logarithmic Schrödinger equation must be added to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation along with a Ginzburg–Sobyanin contribution to correctly determine that the speed of sound scales as the cubic root of pressure for Helium-4 at very low temperatures in close agreement with experiment.

==== Other ====
However, it is clear that in a general case the behaviour of Bose–Einstein condensate can be described by coupled evolution equations for condensate density, superfluid velocity and distribution function of elementary excitations. This problem was solved in 1977 by Peletminskii et al. in microscopical approach. The Peletminskii equations are valid for any finite temperatures below the critical point. Years after, in 1985, Kirkpatrick and Dorfman obtained similar equations using another microscopical approach. The Peletminskii equations also reproduce Khalatnikov hydrodynamical equations for superfluid as a limiting case.

=== Superfluidity of BEC and Landau criterion ===
The phenomena of superfluidity of a Bose gas and superconductivity of a strongly-correlated Fermi gas (a gas of Cooper pairs) are tightly connected to Bose–Einstein condensation. Under corresponding conditions, below the temperature of phase transition, these phenomena were observed in helium-4 and different classes of superconductors. In this sense, the superconductivity is often called the superfluidity of Fermi gas. In the simplest form, the origin of superfluidity can be seen from the weakly interacting bosons model.

== Peculiar properties ==

=== Quantized vortices ===
As in many other systems, vortices can exist in BECs. 
Vortices can be created, for example, by &quot;stirring&quot; the condensate with lasers, 
rotating the confining trap, 
or by rapid cooling across the phase transition. 
The vortex created will be a quantum vortex with core shape determined by the interactions. Fluid circulation around any point is quantized due to the single-valued nature of the order BEC order parameter or wavefunction, that can be written in the form formula_95 where formula_96 and formula_97 are as in the cylindrical coordinate system, and formula_98 is the angular quantum number (a.k.a. the &quot;charge&quot; of the vortex). Since the energy of a vortex is proportional to the square of its angular momentum, in trivial topology only formula_99 vortices can exist in the steady state; Higher-charge vortices will have a tendency to split into formula_99 vortices, if allowed by the topology of the geometry.

An axially symmetric (for instance, harmonic) confining potential is commonly used for the study of vortices in BEC. To determine formula_101, the energy of formula_84 must be minimized, according to the constraint formula_95. This is usually done computationally, however, in a uniform medium, the following analytic form demonstrates the correct behavior, and is a good approximation:

:formula_104

Here, formula_3 is the density far from the vortex and formula_106, where formula_107 is the healing length of the condensate.

A singly charged vortex (formula_99) is in the ground state, with its energy formula_109 given by

:formula_110

where formula_111 is the farthest distance from the vortices considered.(To obtain an energy which is well defined it is necessary to include this boundary formula_112.)

For multiply charged vortices (formula_113) the energy is approximated by

which is greater than that of formula_98 singly charged vortices, indicating that these multiply charged vortices are unstable to decay. Research has, however, indicated they are metastable states, so may have relatively long lifetimes.

Closely related to the creation of vortices in BECs is the generation of so-called dark solitons in one-dimensional BECs. These topological objects feature a phase gradient across their nodal plane, which stabilizes their shape even in propagation and interaction. Although solitons carry no charge and are thus prone to decay, relatively long-lived dark solitons have been produced and studied extensively.

=== Attractive interactions ===
Experiments led by Randall Hulet at Rice University from 1995 through 2000 showed that lithium condensates with attractive interactions could stably exist up to a critical atom number. Quench cooling the gas, they observed the condensate to grow, then subsequently collapse as the attraction overwhelmed the zero-point energy of the confining potential, in a burst reminiscent of a supernova, with an explosion preceded by an implosion.

Further work on attractive condensates was performed in 2000 by the JILA team, of Cornell, Wieman and coworkers. Their instrumentation now had better control so they used naturally &quot;attracting&quot; atoms of rubidium-85 (having negative atom–atom scattering length). Through Feshbach resonance involving a sweep of the magnetic field causing spin flip collisions, they lowered the characteristic, discrete energies at which rubidium bonds, making their Rb-85 atoms repulsive and creating a stable condensate. The reversible flip from attraction to repulsion stems from quantum interference among wave-like condensate atoms.

When the JILA team raised the magnetic field strength further, the condensate suddenly reverted to attraction, imploded and shrank beyond detection, then exploded, expelling about two-thirds of its 10,000 atoms. About half of the atoms in the condensate seemed to have disappeared from the experiment altogether, not seen in the cold remnant or expanding gas cloud. Carl Wieman explained that under current atomic theory this characteristic of Bose–Einstein condensate could not be explained because the energy state of an atom near absolute zero should not be enough to cause an implosion; however, subsequent mean-field theories have been proposed to explain it. Most likely they formed molecules of two rubidium atoms; energy gained by this bond imparts velocity sufficient to leave the trap without being detected.

The process of creation of molecular Bose condensate during the sweep of the magnetic field throughout the Feshbach resonance, as well as the reverse process, are described by the exactly solvable model that can explain many experimental observations.

== Current research ==

Compared to more commonly encountered states of matter, Bose–Einstein condensates are extremely fragile. The slightest interaction with the external environment can be enough to warm them past the condensation threshold, eliminating their interesting properties and forming a normal gas.

Nevertheless, they have proven useful in exploring a wide range of questions in fundamental physics, and the years since the initial discoveries by the JILA and MIT groups have seen an increase in experimental and theoretical activity.

Bose–Einstein condensates composed of a wide range of isotopes have been produced; see below.

=== Fundamental research ===

Examples include experiments that have demonstrated interference between condensates due to wave–particle duality, the study of superfluidity and quantized vortices, the creation of bright matter wave solitons from Bose condensates confined to one dimension, and the slowing of light pulses to very low speeds using electromagnetically induced transparency. Vortices in Bose–Einstein condensates are also currently the subject of analogue gravity research, studying the possibility of modeling black holes and their related phenomena in such environments in the laboratory.

Experimenters have also realized &quot;optical lattices&quot;, where the interference pattern from overlapping lasers provides a periodic potential. These are used to explore the transition between a superfluid and a Mott insulator.

They are also useful in studying Bose–Einstein condensation in fewer than three dimensions, for example the Lieb–Liniger model (an the limit of strong interactions, the Tonks–Girardeau gas) in 1D and the Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless transition in 2D. Indeed, a deep optical lattice allows the experimentalist to freeze the motion of the particles along one or two directions, effectively eliminating one or two dimension from the system.

Further, the sensitivity of the pinning transition of strongly interacting bosons confined in a shallow one-dimensional optical lattice originally observed by Haller has been explored via a tweaking of the primary optical lattice by a secondary weaker one. Thus for a resulting weak bichromatic optical lattice, it has been found that the pinning transition is robust against the
introduction of the weaker secondary optical lattice.

Studies of vortices in nonuniform Bose–Einstein condensates as well as excitations of these systems by the application of moving repulsive or attractive obstacles, have also been undertaken. Within this context, the conditions for order and chaos in the dynamics of a trapped Bose–Einstein condensate have been explored by the application of moving blue and red-detuned laser beams (hitting frequencies slightly above and below the resonance frequency, respectively) via the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation.

=== Applications ===

In 1999, Danish physicist Lene Hau led a team from Harvard University which slowed a beam of light to about 17 meters per second using a superfluid. Hau and her associates have since made a group of condensate atoms recoil from a light pulse such that they recorded the light&#x27;s phase and amplitude, recovered by a second nearby condensate, in what they term &quot;slow-light-mediated atomic matter-wave amplification&quot; using Bose–Einstein condensates.

Another current research interest is the creation of Bose–Einstein condensates in microgravity in order to use its properties for high precision atom interferometry. The first demonstration of a BEC in weightlessness was achieved in 2008 at a drop tower in Bremen, Germany by a consortium of researchers led by Ernst M. Rasel from Leibniz University Hannover. The same team demonstrated in 2017 the first creation of a Bose–Einstein condensate in space and it is also the subject of two upcoming experiments on the International Space Station.

Researchers in the new field of atomtronics use the properties of Bose–Einstein condensates in the emerging quantum technology of matter-wave circuits.

In 1970, BECs were proposed by Emmanuel David Tannenbaum for anti-stealth technology.

=== Isotopes ===

Bose-Einstein condensation has mainly been observed on alkaline atoms, some of which have collisional properties particularly suitable for evaporative cooling in traps, and which where the first to laser-cooled. As of 2021, using ultra-low temperatures of or below, Bose–Einstein condensates had been obtained for a multitude of isotopes with more or less ease, mainly of alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, and lanthanide atoms (, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and metastable (orthohelium)). Research was finally successful in atomic hydrogen with the aid of the newly developed method of &#x27;evaporative cooling&#x27;.

In contrast, the superfluid state of below is differs significantly from dilute degenerate atomic gases because the interaction between the atoms is strong. Only 8% of atoms are in the condensed fraction near absolute zero, rather than near 100% of a weakly interacting BEC.

The bosonic behavior of some of these alkaline gases appears odd at first sight, because their nuclei have half-integer total spin. It arises from the interplay of electronic and nuclear spins: at ultra-low temperatures and corresponding excitation energies, the half-integer total spin of the electronic shell (one outer electron) and half-integer total spin of the nucleus are coupled by a very weak hyperfine interaction. The total spin of the atom, arising from this coupling, is an integer value. Conversely, alkali isotopes which have an integer nuclear spin (such as and ) are fermions and can form degenerate Fermi gases, also called &quot;Fermi condensates&quot;.

Cooling fermions to extremely low temperatures has created degenerate gases, subject to the Pauli exclusion principle. To exhibit Bose–Einstein condensation, the fermions must &quot;pair up&quot; to form bosonic compound particles (e.g. molecules or Cooper pairs). The first molecular condensates were created in November 2003 by the groups of Rudolf Grimm at the University of Innsbruck, Deborah S. Jin at the University of Colorado at Boulder and Wolfgang Ketterle at MIT. Jin quickly went on to create the first fermionic condensate, working with the same system but outside the molecular regime.

=== Continuous Bose–Einstein condensation ===
Limitations of evaporative cooling have restricted atomic BECs to &quot;pulsed&quot; operation, involving a highly inefficient duty cycle that discards more than 99% of atoms to reach BEC. Achieving continuous BEC has been a major open problem of experimental BEC research, driven by the same motivations as continuous optical laser development: high flux, high coherence matter waves produced continuously would enable new sensing applications.

Continuous BEC was achieved for the first time in 2022 with .

=== In solid state physics ===

In 2020, researchers reported the development of superconducting BEC and that there appears to be a &quot;smooth transition between&quot; BEC and Bardeen–Cooper–Shrieffer regimes.

=== Dark matter ===
P. Sikivie and Q. Yang showed that cold dark matter axions would form a Bose–Einstein condensate by thermalisation because of gravitational self-interactions. Axions have not yet been confirmed to exist. However the important search for them has been greatly enhanced with the completion of upgrades to the Axion Dark Matter Experiment (ADMX) at the University of Washington in early 2018.

In 2014, a potential dibaryon was detected at the Jülich Research Center at about 2380 MeV. The center claimed that the measurements confirm results from 2011, via a more replicable method. The particle existed for 10−23 seconds and was named d*(2380). This particle is hypothesized to consist of three up and three down quarks. It is theorized that groups of d* (d-stars) could form Bose–Einstein condensates due to prevailing low temperatures in the early universe, and that BECs made of such hexaquarks with trapped electrons could behave like dark matter.

<text>B is a programming language developed at Bell Labs circa 1969 by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie.

B was derived from BCPL, and its name may possibly be a contraction of BCPL. Thompson&#x27;s coworker Dennis Ritchie speculated that the name might be based on Bon, an earlier, but unrelated, programming language that Thompson designed for use on Multics.

B was designed for recursive, non-numeric, machine-independent applications, such as system and language software. It was a typeless language, with the only data type being the underlying machine&#x27;s natural memory word format, whatever that might be. Depending on the context, the word was treated either as an integer or a memory address.

As machines with ASCII processing became common, notably the DEC PDP-11 that arrived at Bell Labs, support for character data stuffed in memory words became important. The typeless nature of the language was seen as a disadvantage, which led Thompson and Ritchie to develop an expanded version of the language supporting new internal and user-defined types, which became the C programming language.

== History ==
Circa 1969, Ken Thompson and later Dennis Ritchie developed B basing it mainly on the BCPL language Thompson used in the Multics project. B was essentially the BCPL system stripped of any component Thompson felt he could do without in order to make it fit within the memory capacity of the minicomputers of the time. The BCPL to B transition also included changes made to suit Thompson&#x27;s preferences (mostly along the lines of reducing the number of non-whitespace characters in a typical program). Much of the typical ALGOL-like syntax of BCPL was rather heavily changed in this process. The assignment operator codice_1 reverted to the codice_2 of Rutishauser&#x27;s Superplan, and the equality operator codice_2 was replaced by codice_4.

Thompson added &quot;two-address assignment operators&quot; using codice_5 syntax to add y to x (in C the operator is written codice_6). This syntax came from Douglas McIlroy&#x27;s implementation of TMG, in which B&#x27;s compiler was first implemented (and it came to TMG from ALGOL 68&#x27;s codice_7 syntax). Thompson went further by inventing the increment and decrement operators (codice_8 and codice_9). Their prefix or postfix position determines whether the value is taken before or after alteration of the operand. This innovation was not in the earliest versions of B. According to Dennis Ritchie, people often assumed that they were created for the auto-increment and auto-decrement address modes of the DEC PDP-11, but this is historically impossible as the machine didn&#x27;t exist when B was first developed.

The semicolon version of the for loop was borrowed by Ken Thompson from the work of Stephen Johnson.

B is typeless, or more precisely has one data type: the computer word. Most operators (e.g. codice_10, codice_11, codice_12, codice_13) treated this as an integer, but others treated it as a memory address to be dereferenced. In many other ways it looked a lot like an early version of C. There are a few library functions, including some that vaguely resemble functions from the standard I/O library in C. 
In Thompson&#x27;s words: &quot;B and the old old C were very very similar languages except for all the types [in C]&quot;.

Early implementations were for the DEC PDP-7 and PDP-11 minicomputers using early Unix, and Honeywell 36-bit mainframes running the operating system GCOS. The earliest PDP-7 implementations compiled to threaded code, and Ritchie wrote a compiler using TMG which produced machine code. In 1970 a PDP-11 was acquired and threaded code was used for the port; an assembler, , and the B language itself were written in B to bootstrap the computer. An early version of yacc was produced with this PDP-11 configuration. Ritchie took over maintenance during this period.

The typeless nature of B made sense on the Honeywell, PDP-7 and many older computers, but was a problem on the PDP-11 because it was difficult to elegantly access the character data type that the PDP-11 and most modern computers fully support. Starting in 1971 Ritchie made changes to the language while converting its compiler to produce machine code, most notably adding data typing for variables. During 1971 and 1972 B evolved into &quot;New B&quot; (NB) and then C.

B is almost extinct, having been superseded by the C language. However, it continues to see use on GCOS mainframes () 
and on certain embedded systems () for a variety of reasons: limited hardware in small systems, extensive libraries, tooling, licensing cost issues, and simply being good enough for the job. The highly influential AberMUD was originally written in B.

== Examples ==
The following examples are from the &quot;Users&#x27; Reference to B&quot; by Ken Thompson:
/* The following function will print a non-negative number, n, to
 the base b, where 2&lt;=b&lt;=10. This routine uses the fact that
 in the ANSCII character set, the digits 0 to 9 have sequential
 code values. */

printn(n,b) {
 extrn putchar;
 auto a;
 /* Wikipedia note: the auto keyword declares a variable with
 automatic storage (lifetime is function scope), not
 &quot;automatic typing&quot; as in C++11. */

 if(a=n/b) /* assignment, not test for equality */
 printn(a, b); /* recursive */
 putchar(n%b + &#x27;0&#x27;);

/* The following program will calculate the constant e-2 to about
 4000 decimal digits, and print it 50 characters to the line in
 groups of 5 characters. The method is simple output conver-
 sion of the expansion
 1/2! + 1/3! + ... = .111...
 where the bases of the digits are 2, 3, 4, ... */

main() {
 extrn putchar, n, v;
 auto i, c, col, a;

 i = col = 0;
 while(i&lt;n)
 v[i++] = 1;

 while(col&lt;2*n) {
 a = n+1;
 c = i = 0;
 while(i&lt;n) {
 c =+ v[i]*10;
 v[i++] = c%a;
 c =/ a--;
 putchar(c+&#x27;0&#x27;);
 if(!(++col%5))
 putchar(col%50?&#x27; &#x27;:&#x27;*n&#x27;);
 putchar(&#x27;*n*n&#x27;);

v[2000];
n 2000;

<text>The Beer–Bouguer–Lambert (BBL) extinction law is an empirical relationship describing the attenuation in intensity of a radiation beam passing through a macroscopically homogenous medium with which it interacts. Formally, it states that the intensity of radiation decays exponentially in the absorbance of the medium, and that said absorbance is proportional to the length of beam passing through the medium, the concentration of interacting matter along that path, and a constant representing said matter&#x27;s propensity to interact.

The extinction law&#x27;s primary application is in chemical analysis, where it underlies the Beer–Lambert law, commonly called Beer&#x27;s law. Beer&#x27;s law states that a beam of visible light passing through a chemical solution of fixed geometry experiences absorption proportional to the solute concentration. Other applications appear in physical optics, where it quantifies astronomical extinction and the absorption of photons, neutrons, or rarefied gases.

Forms of the BBL law date back to the mid-eighteenth century, but it only took its modern form during the early twentieth.

== History ==
The first work towards the BBL law began with astronomical observations Pierre Bouguer performed in the early eighteenth century and published in 1729. Bouguer needed to compensate for the refraction of light by the earth&#x27;s atmosphere, and found it necessary to measure the local height of the atmosphere. The latter, he sought to obtain through variations in the observed intensity of known stars. When calibrating this effect, Bouguer discovered that light intensity had an exponential dependence on length traveled through the atmosphere (in Bouguer&#x27;s terms, a geometric progression).

Bouguer&#x27;s work was then popularized in Johann Heinrich Lambert&#x27;s &quot;Photometria&quot; in 1760. Lambert expressed the law, which states that the loss of light intensity when it propagates in a medium is directly proportional to intensity and path length, in a mathematical form quite similar to that used in modern physics. Lambert began by assuming that the intensity of light traveling into an absorbing body would be given by the differential equation formula_1 which is compatible with Bouguer&#x27;s observations. The constant of proportionality was often termed the &quot;optical density&quot; of the body. As long as is constant along a distance , the exponential attenuation law, formula_2 follows from integration.

In 1852, August Beer noticed that colored solutions also appeared to exhibit a similar attenuation relation. In his analysis, Beer does not discuss Bouguer and Lambert&#x27;s prior work, writing in his introduction that &quot;Concerning the absolute magnitude of the absorption that a particular ray of light suffers during its propagation through an absorbing medium, there is no information available.&quot; Beer may have omitted reference to Bouguer&#x27;s work because there is a subtle physical difference between color absorption in solutions and astronomical contexts. Solutions are homogeneous and do not scatter light at common analytical wavelengths (ultraviolet, visible, or infrared), except at entry and exit. Thus light within a solution is reasonably approximated as due to absorption alone. In Bouguer&#x27;s context, atmospheric dust or other inhomogeneities could also scatter light away from the detector. Modern texts combine the two laws because scattering and absorption have the same effect. Thus a scattering coefficient and an absorption coefficient can be combined into a total extinction coefficient .

Importantly, Beer also seems to have conceptualized his result in terms of a given thickness&#x27; opacity, writing &quot;If is the coefficient (fraction) of diminution, then this coefficient (fraction) will have the value for double this thickness.&quot; Although this geometric progression is mathematically equivalent to the modern law, modern treatments instead emphasize the logarithm of , which clarifies that concentration and path length have equivalent effects on the absorption. An early, possibly the first, modern formulation was given by Robert Luther and Andreas Nikolopulos in 1913.

== Mathematical formulations ==
There are several equivalent formulations of the BBL law, depending on the precise choice of measured quantities. All of them state that, provided that the physical state is held constant, the extinction process is linear in the intensity of radiation and amount of radiatively-active matter, a fact sometimes called the fundamental law of extinction. Many of them then connect the quantity of radiatively-active matter to a length traveled and a concentration or number density . The latter two are related by Avogadro&#x27;s number: .

A collimated beam (directed radiation) with cross-sectional area will encounter particles (on average) during its travel. However, not all of these particles interact with the beam. Propensity to interact is a material-dependent property, typically summarized in absorptivity or scattering cross-section . These almost exhibit another Avogadro-type relationship: . The factor of appears because physicists tend to use natural logarithms and chemists decadal logarithms.

Beam intensity can also be described in terms of multiple variables: the intensity or radiant flux . In the case of a collimated beam, these are related by , but is often used in non-collimated contexts. The ratio of intensity (or flux) in to out is sometimes summarized as a transmittance coefficient .

When considering an extinction law, dimensional analysis can verify the consistency of the variables, as logarithms (being nonlinear) must always be dimensionless.

=== Formulation ===
The simplest formulation of Beer&#x27;s relates the optical attenuation of a physical material containing a single attenuating species of uniform concentration to the optical path length through the sample and absorptivity of the species. This expression is:formula_3The quantities so equated are defined to be the absorbance , which depends on the logarithm base. The Naperian absorbance is then given by and satisfies formula_4

If multiple species in the material interact with the radiation, then their absorbances add. Thus a slightly more general formulation is that formula_5where the sum is over all possible radiation-interacting (&quot;translucent&quot;) species, and indexes those species.

In situations where length may vary significantly, absorbance is sometimes summarized in terms of an attenuation coefficient formula_6

In atmospheric science and radiation shielding applications, the attenuation coefficient may vary significantly through an inhomogenous material. In those situations, the most general form of the Beer–Lambert law states that the total attenuation can be obtained by integrating the attenuation coefficient over small slices of the beamline: formula_7These formulations then reduce to the simpler versions when there is only one active species and the attenuation coefficients are constant.

== Derivation ==
There are two factors that determine the degree to which a medium containing particles will attenuate a light beam: the number of particles encountered by the light beam, and the degree to which each particle extinguishes the light.

Assume that a beam of light enters a material sample. Define as an axis parallel to the direction of the beam. Divide the material sample into thin slices, perpendicular to the beam of light, with thickness sufficiently small that one particle in a slice cannot obscure another particle in the same slice when viewed along the direction. The radiant flux of the light that emerges from a slice is reduced, compared to that of the light that entered, by formula_8 where is the (Napierian) attenuation coefficient, which yields the following first-order linear, ordinary differential equation:formula_9
The attenuation is caused by the photons that did not make it to the other side of the slice because of scattering or absorption. The solution to this differential equation is obtained by multiplying the integrating factorformula_10throughout to obtainformula_11which simplifies due to the product rule (applied backwards) toformula_12

Integrating both sides and solving for for a material of real thickness , with the incident radiant flux upon the slice formula_13 and the transmitted radiant flux formula_14 givesformula_15and finallyformula_16

Since the decadic attenuation coefficient is related to the (Napierian) attenuation coefficient by formula_17 we also haveformula_18

To describe the attenuation coefficient in a way independent of the number densities of the attenuating species of the material sample, one introduces the attenuation cross section formula_19 has the dimension of an area; it expresses the likelihood of interaction between the particles of the beam and the particles of the species in the material sample:formula_20

One can also use the molar attenuation coefficients formula_21 where is the Avogadro constant, to describe the attenuation coefficient in a way independent of the amount concentrations formula_22 of the attenuating species of the material sample:formula_23

=== Validity ===
Under certain conditions the Beer–Lambert law fails to maintain a linear relationship between attenuation and concentration of analyte. These deviations are classified into three categories:
# Real—fundamental deviations due to the limitations of the law itself.
# Chemical—deviations observed due to specific chemical species of the sample which is being analyzed.
# Instrument—deviations which occur due to how the attenuation measurements are made.

There are at least six conditions that need to be fulfilled in order for the Beer–Lambert law to be valid. These are:
# The attenuators must act independently of each other.
# The attenuating medium must be homogeneous in the interaction volume.
# The attenuating medium must not scatter the radiation—no turbidity—unless this is accounted for as in DOAS.
# The incident radiation must consist of parallel rays, each traversing the same length in the absorbing medium.
# The incident radiation should preferably be monochromatic, or have at least a width that is narrower than that of the attenuating transition. Otherwise a spectrometer as detector for the power is needed instead of a photodiode which cannot discriminate between wavelengths.
# The incident flux must not influence the atoms or molecules; it should only act as a non-invasive probe of the species under study. In particular, this implies that the light should not cause optical saturation or optical pumping, since such effects will deplete the lower level and possibly give rise to stimulated emission.

If any of these conditions are not fulfilled, there will be deviations from the Beer–Lambert law.

The law tends to break down at very high concentrations, especially if the material is highly scattering. Absorbance within range of 0.2 to 0.5 is ideal to maintain linearity in the Beer–Lambert law. If the radiation is especially intense, nonlinear optical processes can also cause variances. The main reason, however, is that the concentration dependence is in general non-linear and Beer&#x27;s law is valid only under certain conditions as shown by derivation below. For strong oscillators and at high concentrations the deviations are stronger. If the molecules are closer to each other interactions can set in. These interactions can be roughly divided into physical and chemical interactions. Physical interaction do not alter the polarizability of the molecules as long as the interaction is not so strong that light and molecular quantum state intermix (strong coupling), but cause the attenuation cross sections to be non-additive via electromagnetic coupling. Chemical interactions in contrast change the polarizability and thus absorption.

In solids, attenuation is usually an addition of absorption coefficient formula_24 (creation of electron-hole pairs) or scattering (for example Rayleigh scattering if the scattering centers are much smaller than the incident wavelength). Also note that for some systems we can put formula_25 (1 over inelastic mean free path) in place of 

== Applications ==

===In plasma physics===

The BBL extinction law also arises as a solution to the BGK equation.

=== Chemical analysis by spectrophotometry ===
The Beer–Lambert law can be applied to the analysis of a mixture by spectrophotometry, without the need for extensive pre-processing of the sample. An example is the determination of bilirubin in blood plasma samples. The spectrum of pure bilirubin is known, so the molar attenuation coefficient is known. Measurements of decadic attenuation coefficient are made at one wavelength that is nearly unique for bilirubin and at a second wavelength in order to correct for possible interferences. The amount concentration is then given by
formula_26

For a more complicated example, consider a mixture in solution containing two species at amount concentrations and . The decadic attenuation coefficient at any wavelength is, given by
formula_27

Therefore, measurements at two wavelengths yields two equations in two unknowns and will suffice to determine the amount concentrations and as long as the molar attenuation coefficients of the two components, and are known at both wavelengths. This two system equation can be solved using Cramer&#x27;s rule. In practice it is better to use linear least squares to determine the two amount concentrations from measurements made at more than two wavelengths. Mixtures containing more than two components can be analyzed in the same way, using a minimum of wavelengths for a mixture containing components.

The law is used widely in infra-red spectroscopy and near-infrared spectroscopy for analysis of polymer degradation and oxidation (also in biological tissue) as well as to measure the concentration of various compounds in different food samples. The carbonyl group attenuation at about 6 micrometres can be detected quite easily, and degree of oxidation of the polymer calculated.

=== In-atmosphere astronomy ===
The Bouguer–Lambert law may be applied to describe the attenuation of solar or stellar radiation as it travels through the atmosphere. In this case, there is scattering of radiation as well as absorption. The optical depth for a slant path is , where refers to a vertical path, is called the relative airmass, and for a plane-parallel atmosphere it is determined as where is the zenith angle corresponding to the given path. The Bouguer-Lambert law for the atmosphere is usually written
formula_28
where each is the optical depth whose subscript identifies the source of the absorption or scattering it describes:
* refers to aerosols (that absorb and scatter);
* are uniformly mixed gases (mainly carbon dioxide (CO2) and molecular oxygen (O2) which only absorb);
* is nitrogen dioxide, mainly due to urban pollution (absorption only);
* are effects due to Raman scattering in the atmosphere;
* is water vapour absorption;
* is ozone (absorption only);
* is Rayleigh scattering from molecular oxygen () and nitrogen () (responsible for the blue color of the sky);
* the selection of the attenuators which have to be considered depends on the wavelength range and can include various other compounds. This can include tetraoxygen, HONO, formaldehyde, glyoxal, a series of halogen radicals and others.

 is the &quot;optical mass&quot; or &quot;airmass factor&quot;, a term approximately equal (for small and moderate values of ) to where is the observed object&#x27;s zenith angle (the angle measured from the direction perpendicular to the Earth&#x27;s surface at the observation site). This equation can be used to retrieve , the aerosol optical thickness, which is necessary for the correction of satellite images and also important in accounting for the role of aerosols in climate.

<text>The Beach Boys are an American rock band formed in Hawthorne, California, in 1961. The group&#x27;s original lineup consisted of brothers Brian, Dennis and Carl Wilson, their cousin Mike Love, and friend Al Jardine. Distinguished by their vocal harmonies, adolescent-oriented lyrics, and musical ingenuity, they are one of the most influential acts of the rock era. The group drew on the music of older pop vocal groups, 1950s rock and roll, and black R&amp;B to create their unique sound. Under Brian&#x27;s direction, they often incorporated classical or jazz elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways.

The Beach Boys formed as a garage band centered on Brian&#x27;s songwriting and managed by the Wilsons&#x27; father, Murry. In 1963, they enjoyed their first national hit with &quot;Surfin&#x27; U.S.A.&quot;, beginning a string of top-ten singles that reflected a southern California youth culture of surfing, cars, and romance, dubbed the &quot;California sound&quot;. They were one of the few American rock bands to sustain their commercial standing during the British Invasion. Starting with 1965&#x27;s &quot;The Beach Boys Today!&quot;, they abandoned beachgoing themes for more personal lyrics and ambitious orchestrations. In 1966, the &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; album and &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; single raised the group&#x27;s prestige as rock innovators; both are now widely considered to be among the greatest and most influential works in popular music history. After scrapping the &quot;Smile&quot; album in 1967, Brian gradually ceded control of the group to his bandmates.

In the late 1960s, the group&#x27;s commercial momentum faltered in the U.S., and they were widely dismissed by the early rock music press before undergoing a rebranding in the early 1970s. Carl took over as &quot;de facto&quot; leader until the mid-1970s, when the band responded to the growing success of their live shows and greatest hits compilations by transitioning into an oldies act. Dennis drowned in 1983, and Brian soon became estranged from the group. Following Carl&#x27;s death from lung cancer in 1998, the band granted Love legal rights to tour under the group&#x27;s name. In the early 2010s, the original members briefly reunited for the band&#x27;s 50th anniversary tour. Currently, Brian and Jardine do not perform with Love&#x27;s edition of the Beach Boys, but remain official members of the band.

The Beach Boys are one of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful bands of all time, selling over 100 million records worldwide. They helped legitimize popular music as a recognized art form, and influenced the development of music genres and movements such as psychedelia, power pop, progressive rock, punk, alternative, and lo-fi. Between the 1960s and 2020s, the group had 37 songs reach the U.S. Top 40 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 (the most by an American band), with four topping the chart. In 2004, the group was ranked number 12 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the greatest artists of all time. Many critics&#x27; polls have ranked &quot;Today!&quot;, &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; (1967), &quot;Sunflower&quot; (1970), &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; (1971), and &quot;The Beach Boys Love You&quot; (1977) among the finest albums in history. The founding members were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988. Other members during the band&#x27;s history have been David Marks, Bruce Johnston, Blondie Chaplin, and Ricky Fataar.

==History==

=== 1958–1961: Formation ===

At the time of his 16th birthday on June 20, 1958, Brian Wilson shared a bedroom with his brothers, Dennis and Carlaged 13 and 11, respectivelyin their family home in Hawthorne. He had watched his father Murry Wilson play piano, and had listened intently to the harmonies of vocal groups such as the Four Freshmen. After dissecting songs such as &quot;Ivory Tower&quot; and &quot;Good News&quot;, Brian would teach family members how to sing the background harmonies. For his birthday that year, Brian received a reel-to-reel tape recorder. He learned how to overdub, using his vocals and those of Carl and their mother. Brian played piano, while Carl and David Marks, an eleven-year-old longtime neighbor, played guitars that each had received as Christmas presents.

Soon Brian and Carl were avidly listening to Johnny Otis&#x27; KFOX radio show. Inspired by the simple structure and vocals of the rhythm and blues songs he heard, Brian changed his piano-playing style and started writing songs. Family gatherings brought the Wilsons in contact with cousin Mike Love. Brian taught Love&#x27;s sister Maureen and a friend harmonies. Later, Brian, Love and two friends performed at Hawthorne High School. Brian also knew Al Jardine, a high school classmate. Brian suggested to Jardine that they team up with his cousin and brother Carl. Love gave the fledgling band its name: &quot;The Pendletones&quot;, a pun on &quot;Pendleton&quot;, a brand of woollen shirt popular at the time. Dennis was the only avid surfer in the group, and he suggested that the group write songs that celebrated the sport and the lifestyle that it had inspired in Southern California. Brian finished the song, titled &quot;Surfin&quot;, and with Mike Love, wrote &quot;Surfin&#x27; Safari&quot;.

Murry Wilson, who was an occasional songwriter, arranged for the Pendletones to meet his publisher Hite Morgan. He said: &quot;Finally, [Hite] agreed to hear it, and Mrs. Morgan said &#x27;Drop everything, we&#x27;re going to record your song. I think it&#x27;s good.&#x27; And she&#x27;s the one responsible.&quot; On September 15, 1961, the band recorded a demo of &quot;Surfin with the Morgans. A more professional recording was made on October 3, at World Pacific Studio in Hollywood. David Marks was not present at the session as he was in school that day. Murry brought the demos to Herb Newman, owner of Candix Records and Era Records, and he signed the group on December 8. When the single was released a few weeks later, the band found that they had been renamed &quot;the Beach Boys&quot;. Candix wanted to name the group the Surfers until Russ Regan, a young promoter with Era Records, noted that there already existed a group by that name. He suggested calling them the Beach Boys. &quot;Surfin was a regional success for the West Coast, and reached number 75 on the national &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart.

=== 1962–1967: Peak years ===
==== &quot;Surfin&#x27; Safari&quot;, &quot;Surfin&#x27; U.S.A.&quot;, &quot;Surfer Girl&quot;, and &quot;Little Deuce Coupe&quot; ====

By this time the de facto manager of the Beach Boys, Murry landed the group&#x27;s first paying gig (for which they earned $300) on New Year&#x27;s Eve, 1961, at the Ritchie Valens Memorial Dance in Long Beach. In their early public appearances, the band wore heavy wool jacket-like shirts that local surfers favored before switching to their trademark striped shirts and white pants (a look that was taken directly from the Kingston Trio). All five members sang, with Brian playing bass, Dennis playing drums, Carl playing lead guitar, and Al Jardine playing rhythm guitar, while Mike Love was the main singer and occasionally played saxophone. In early 1962, Morgan requested that some of the members add vocals to a couple of instrumental tracks that he had recorded with other musicians. This led to the creation of the short-lived group Kenny &amp; the Cadets, which Brian led under the pseudonym &quot;Kenny&quot;. The other members were Carl, Jardine, and the Wilsons&#x27; mother Audree. In February, Jardine left the Beach Boys and was replaced by David Marks on rhythm guitar. A common misconception is that Jardine left to focus on dental school. In reality, Jardine did not even apply to dental school until 1964, and the reason he left in February 1962 was due to creative differences and his belief that the newly-formed group would not be a commercial success.

After being turned down by Dot and Liberty, the Beach Boys signed a seven-year contract with Capitol Records. This was at the urging of Capitol executive and staff producer Nick Venet who signed the group, seeing them as the &quot;teenage gold&quot; he had been scouting for. On June 4, 1962, the Beach Boys debuted on Capitol with their second single, &quot;Surfin&#x27; Safari&quot; backed with &quot;409&quot;. The release prompted national coverage in the June 9 issue of &quot;Billboard&quot;, which praised Love&#x27;s lead vocal and said the song had potential. &quot;Surfin&#x27; Safari&quot; rose to number 14 and found airplay in New York and Phoenix, a surprise for the label.

The Beach Boys&#x27; first album, &quot;Surfin&#x27; Safari&quot;, was released in October 1962. It was different from other rock albums of the time in that it consisted almost entirely of original songs, primarily written by Brian with Mike Love and friend Gary Usher. Another unusual feature of the Beach Boys was that, although they were marketed as &quot;surf music&quot;, their repertoire bore little resemblance to the music of other surf bands, which was mainly instrumental and incorporated heavy use of spring reverb. For this reason, some of the Beach Boys&#x27; early local performances had young audience members throwing vegetables at the band, believing that the group were poseurs.

In January 1963, the Beach Boys recorded their first top-ten single, &quot;Surfin&#x27; U.S.A.&quot;, which began their long run of highly successful recording efforts. It was during the sessions for this single that Brian made the production decision from that point on to use double tracking on the group&#x27;s vocals, resulting in a deeper and more resonant sound. The album of the same name followed in March and reached number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. Its success propelled the group into a nationwide spotlight, and was vital to launching surf music as a national craze, albeit the Beach Boys&#x27; vocal approach to the genre, not the original instrumental style pioneered by Dick Dale. Biographer Luis Sanchez highlights the &quot;Surfin&#x27; U.S.A.&quot; single as a turning point for the band, &quot;creat[ing] a direct passage to California life for a wide teenage audience ... [and] a distinct Southern California sensibility that exceeded its conception as such to advance right to the front of American consciousness&quot;.

Throughout 1963, and for the next few years, Brian produced a variety of singles for outside artists. Among these were the Honeys, a surfer trio that comprised sisters Diane and Marilyn Rovell with cousin Ginger Blake. Brian was convinced that they could be a successful female counterpart to the Beach Boys, and he produced a number of singles for them, although they could not replicate the Beach Boys&#x27; popularity. He also attended some of Phil Spector&#x27;s sessions at Gold Star Studios. His creative and songwriting interests were revamped upon hearing the Ronettes&#x27; 1963 song &quot;Be My Baby&quot;, which was produced by Spector. The first time he heard the song was while driving, and was so overwhelmed that he had to pull over to the side of the road and analyze the chorus. Later, he reflected: &quot;I was unable to really think as a producer up until the time where I really got familiar with Phil Spector&#x27;s work. That was when I started to design the experience to be a record rather than just a song.&quot;
&quot;Surfer Girl&quot; marked the first time the group used outside musicians on a substantial portion of an LP. Many of them were the musicians Spector used for his Wall of Sound productions. Only a month after &quot;Surfer Girl&quot;&#x27;s release the group&#x27;s fourth album &quot;Little Deuce Coupe&quot; was issued. To close 1963, the band released a standalone Christmas-themed single &quot;Little Saint Nick&quot;, backed with an a cappella rendition of the scriptural song &quot;The Lord&#x27;s Prayer&quot;. The A-side peaked at number 3 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Christmas chart. By the end of the year David Marks had left the group and Al Jardine had returned.

==== British Invasion, &quot;Shut Down Volume 2&quot;, &quot;All Summer Long&quot;, and &quot;Christmas Album&quot; ====

The surf music craze, along with the careers of nearly all surf acts, was slowly replaced by the British Invasion. Following a successful Australasian tour in January and February 1964, the Beach Boys returned home to face their new competition, the Beatles. Both groups shared the same record label in the US, and Capitol&#x27;s support for the Beach Boys immediately began waning. Although it generated a top-five single in &quot;Fun Fun Fun&quot;, the group&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Shut Down Volume 2&quot;, became their first since &quot;Surfin&#x27; Safari&quot; not to reach the US top-ten. This caused Murry to fight for the band at the label more than before, often visiting their offices without warning to &quot;twist executive arms&quot;. Carl said that Phil Spector &quot;was Brian&#x27;s favorite kind of rock; he liked [him] better than the early Beatles stuff. He loved the Beatles&#x27; later music when they evolved and started making intelligent, masterful music, but before that Phil was it.&quot; According to Mike Love, Carl followed the Beatles closer than anyone else in the band, while Brian was the most &quot;rattled&quot; by the Beatles and felt tremendous pressure to &quot;keep pace&quot; with them. For Brian, the Beatles ultimately &quot;eclipsed a lot [of what] we&#x27;d worked for ... [they] eclipsed the whole music world&quot;.

Brian wrote his last surf song for nearly four years, &quot;Don&#x27;t Back Down&quot;, in April 1964. That month, during recording of the single &quot;I Get Around&quot;, Murry was relieved of his duties as manager. He remained in close contact with the group and attempted to continue advising on their career decisions. When &quot;I Get Around&quot; was released in May, it would climb to number 1 in the US and Canada, their first single to do so (also reaching the top-ten in Sweden and the UK), proving that the Beach Boys could compete with contemporary British pop groups. &quot;I Get Around&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Back Down&quot; both appeared on the band&#x27;s sixth album &quot;All Summer Long&quot;, released in July 1964 and reaching number 4 in the US. &quot;All Summer Long&quot; introduced exotic textures to the Beach Boys&#x27; sound exemplified by the piccolos and xylophones of its title track. The album was a swan-song to the surf and car music the Beach Boys built their commercial standing upon. Later albums took a different stylistic and lyrical path. Before this, a live album, &quot;Beach Boys Concert&quot;, was released in October to a four-week chart stay at number 1, containing a set list of previously recorded songs and covers that they had not yet recorded.
In June 1964, Brian recorded the bulk of &quot;The Beach Boys&#x27; Christmas Album&quot; with a forty-one-piece studio orchestra in collaboration with Four Freshmen arranger Dick Reynolds. The album was a response to Phil Spector&#x27;s &quot;A Christmas Gift for You&quot; (1963). Released in December, the Beach Boys&#x27; album was divided between five new, original Christmas-themed songs, and seven reinterpretations of traditional Christmas songs. It would be regarded as one of the finest holiday albums of the rock era. One single from the album, &quot;The Man with All the Toys&quot;, was released, peaking at number 6 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Christmas chart. On October 29, the Beach Boys performed for &quot;The T.A.M.I. Show&quot;, a concert film intended to bring together a wide range of musicians for a one-off performance. The result was released to movie theaters one month later.

====&quot;Today!&quot;, &quot;Summer Days&quot;, and &quot;Party!&quot;====

By the end of 1964, the stress of road travel, writing, and producing became too much for Brian. On December 23, while on a flight from Los Angeles to Houston, he suffered a panic attack. In January 1965, he announced his withdrawal from touring to concentrate entirely on songwriting and record production. For the last few days of 1964 and into early 1965, session musician and up-and-coming solo artist Glen Campbell agreed to temporarily serve as Brian&#x27;s replacement in concert. Carl took over as the band&#x27;s musical director onstage. Now a full-time studio artist, Brian wanted to move the Beach Boys beyond their surf aesthetic, believing that their image was antiquated and distracting the public from his talents as a producer and songwriter. Musically, he said he began to &quot;take the things I learned from Phil Spector and use more instruments whenever I could. I doubled up on basses and tripled up on keyboards, which made everything sound bigger and deeper.&quot;

Released in March 1965, &quot;The Beach Boys Today!&quot; marked the first time the group experimented with the &quot;album-as-art&quot; form. The tracks on side one feature an uptempo sound that contrasts side two, which consists mostly of emotional ballads. Music writer Scott Schinder referenced its &quot;suite-like structure&quot; as an early example of the rock album format being used to make a cohesive artistic statement. Brian also established his new lyrical approach toward the autobiographical; journalist Nick Kent wrote that the subjects of Brian&#x27;s songs &quot;were suddenly no longer simple happy souls harmonizing their sun-kissed innocence and dying devotion to each other over a honey-coated backdrop of surf and sand. Instead, they&#x27;d become highly vulnerable, slightly neurotic and riddled with telling insecurities.&quot; In the book &quot;Yeah Yeah Yeah: The Story of Modern Pop&quot;, Bob Stanley remarked that &quot;Brian was aiming for Johnny Mercer but coming up proto-indie.&quot; In 2012, the album was voted 271 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

In April 1965, Campbell&#x27;s own career success pulled him from touring with the group. Columbia Records staff producer Bruce Johnston was asked to locate a replacement for Campbell; having failed to find one, Johnston himself became a full-time member of the band on May 19, 1965. With Johnston&#x27;s arrival, Brian now had a sixth voice he could work with in the band&#x27;s vocal arrangements, with the June 4 vocal sessions for &quot;California Girls&quot; being Johnston&#x27;s first recording session with the Beach Boys. &quot;California Girls&quot; was included on the band&#x27;s next album &quot;Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!)&quot; and eventually charted at number 3 in the US as the second single from the album, while the album itself went to number 2. The first single from &quot;Summer Days&quot; had been a reworked arrangement of &quot;Help Me, Rhonda&quot;, which became the band&#x27;s second number 1 US single in the spring of 1965. For contractual reasons, owing to his previous deal with Columbia Records, Johnston was not able to be credited or pictured on Beach Boys records until 1967.

To appease Capitol&#x27;s demands for a Beach Boys LP for the 1965 Christmas season, Brian conceived &quot;Beach Boys&#x27; Party!&quot;, a live-in-the-studio album consisting mostly of acoustic covers of 1950s rock and R&amp;B songs, in addition to covers of three Beatles songs, Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;The Times They Are a-Changin&#x27;&quot;, and idiosyncratic rerecordings of the group&#x27;s earlier songs. The album was an early precursor of the &quot;unplugged&quot; trend. It also included a cover of the Regents&#x27; song &quot;Barbara Ann&quot;, which unexpectedly reached number 2 when released as a single several weeks later. In November, the group released another top-twenty single, &quot;The Little Girl I Once Knew&quot;. It was considered the band&#x27;s most experimental statement thus far. The single continued Brian&#x27;s ambitions for daring arrangements, featuring unexpected tempo changes and numerous false endings. With the exception of their 1963 and 1964 Christmas singles (&quot;Little Saint Nick&quot; and &quot;The Man with All the Toys&quot;) it was the group&#x27;s lowest charting single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 since &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot; in 1962, peaking at number 20. According to Luis Sanchez, in 1965, Bob Dylan was &quot;rewriting the rules for pop success&quot; with his music and image, and it was at this juncture that Wilson &quot;led The Beach Boys into a transitional phase in an effort to win the pop terrain that had been thrown up for grabs&quot;.

==== &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; ====

Wilson collaborated with jingle writer Tony Asher for several of the songs on the album &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, a refinement of the themes and ideas that were introduced in &quot;Today!&quot;. In some ways, the music was a jarring departure from their earlier style. Jardine explained that &quot;it took us quite a while to adjust to [the new material] because it wasn&#x27;t music you could necessarily dance to—it was more like music you could make love to&quot;. In &quot;The Journal on the Art of Record Production&quot;, Marshall Heiser writes that &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; &quot;diverges from previous Beach Boys&#x27; efforts in several ways: its sound field has a greater sense of depth and &#x27;warmth;&#x27; the songs employ even more inventive use of harmony and chord voicings; the prominent use of percussion is a key feature (as opposed to driving drum backbeats); whilst the orchestrations, at times, echo the quirkiness of &#x27;exotica&#x27; bandleader Les Baxter, or the &#x27;cool&#x27; of Burt Bacharach, more so than Spector&#x27;s teen fanfares&quot;.

For &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, Brian desired to make &quot;a complete statement&quot;, similar to what he believed the Beatles had done with their newest album &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, released in December 1965. Brian was immediately enamored with the album, given the impression that it had no filler tracks, a feature that was mostly unheard of at a time when 45 rpm singles were considered more noteworthy than full-length LPs. He later said: &quot;It didn&#x27;t make me want to copy them but to be as good as them. I didn&#x27;t want to do the same kind of music, but on the same level.&quot; Thanks to mutual connections, Brian was introduced to the Beatles&#x27; former press officer Derek Taylor, who was subsequently employed as the Beach Boys&#x27; publicist. Responding to Brian&#x27;s request to reinvent the band&#x27;s image, Taylor devised a promotion campaign with the tagline &quot;Brian Wilson is a genius&quot;, a belief Taylor sincerely held. Taylor&#x27;s prestige was crucial in offering a credible perspective to those on the outside, and his efforts are widely recognized as instrumental in the album&#x27;s success in Britain.

Released on May 16, 1966, &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; was widely influential and raised the band&#x27;s prestige as an innovative rock group. Early reviews for the album in the US ranged from negative to tentatively positive, and its sales numbered approximately 500,000 units, a drop-off from the run of albums that immediately preceded it. It was assumed that Capitol considered &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; a risk, appealing more to an older demographic than the younger, female audience upon which the Beach Boys had built their commercial standing. Within two months, the label capitulated by releasing the group&#x27;s first greatest hits compilation album, &quot;Best of the Beach Boys&quot;, which was quickly certified gold by the RIAA. By contrast, &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; met a highly favorable critical response in Britain, where it reached number 2 and remained among the top-ten positions for six months. Responding to the hype, &quot;Melody Maker&quot; ran a feature in which many pop musicians were asked whether they believed that the album was truly revolutionary and progressive, or &quot;as sickly as peanut butter&quot;. The author concluded that &quot;the record&#x27;s impact on artists and the men behind the artists has been considerable&quot;.

==== &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; and &quot;Smile&quot; ====
Throughout the summer of 1966, Brian concentrated on finishing the group&#x27;s next single, &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;. Instead of working on whole songs with clear large-scale syntactical structures, he limited himself to recording short interchangeable fragments (or &quot;modules&quot;). Through the method of tape splicing, each fragment could then be assembled into a linear sequence, allowing any number of larger structures and divergent moods to be produced at a later time. Coming at a time when pop singles were usually recorded in under two hours, it was one of the most complex pop productions ever undertaken, with sessions for the song stretching over several months in four major Hollywood studios. It was also the most expensive single ever recorded to that point, with production costs estimated to be in the tens of thousands.

In the midst of &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; sessions, Wilson invited session musician and songwriter Van Dyke Parks to collaborate as lyricist for the Beach Boys&#x27; next album project, soon titled &quot;Smile&quot;. Parks agreed. Wilson and Parks intended &quot;Smile&quot; to be a continuous suite of songs linked both thematically and musically, with the main songs linked together by small vocal pieces and instrumental segments that elaborated on the major songs&#x27; musical themes. It was explicitly American in style and subject, a conscious reaction to the overwhelming British dominance of popular music at the time. Some of the music incorporated chanting, cowboy songs, explorations in Indian and Hawaiian music, jazz, classical tone poems, cartoon sound effects, &quot;musique concrète&quot;, and yodeling. &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; writer Jules Siegel recalled that, on one October evening, Brian announced to his wife and friends that he was &quot;writing a teenage symphony to God&quot;.

Recording for &quot;Smile&quot; lasted about a year, from mid-1966 to mid-1967, and followed the same modular production approach as &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;. Concurrently, Wilson planned many different multimedia side projects, such as a sound effects collage, a comedy album, and a &quot;health food&quot; album. Capitol did not support all these ideas, which led to the Beach Boys&#x27; desire to form their own label, Brother Records. According to biographer Steven Gaines, Wilson employed his newfound &quot;best friend&quot; David Anderle as head of the label.

Throughout 1966, EMI flooded the UK market with Beach Boys albums not yet released there, including &quot;Beach Boys&#x27; Party!&quot;, &quot;The Beach Boys Today!&quot; and &quot;Summer Days (and Summer Nights!!)&quot;, while &quot;Best of the Beach Boys&quot; was number 2 there for several weeks at the end of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mawer/OCC&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Over the final quarter of 1966, the Beach Boys were the highest-selling album act in the UK, where for the first time in three years American artists broke the chart dominance of British acts. In 1971, &quot;Cue&quot; magazine wrote that, from mid-1966 to late-1967, the Beach Boys &quot;were among the vanguard in practically every aspect of the counter culture&quot;.

Released on October 10, 1966, &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; was the Beach Boys&#x27; third US number 1 single, reaching the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in December, and became their first number 1 in Britain. That month, the record was their first single certified gold by the RIAA. It came to be widely acclaimed as one of the greatest masterpieces of rock music. In December 1966, the Beach Boys were voted the top band in the world in the &quot;NME&quot;″s annual readers&#x27; poll, ahead of the Beatles, the Walker Brothers, the Rolling Stones, and the Four Tops.

Throughout the first half of 1967, the release date for &quot;Smile&quot; was repeatedly postponed as Brian continuously tinkered with the recordings, experimenting with different takes and mixes, and appeared unable or unwilling to supply finished versions of songs. Meanwhile, he began to suffer from delusions and paranoia, believing on one occasion that the would-be album track &quot;Fire&quot; caused a building to burn down. On January 3, 1967, Carl Wilson refused to be drafted for military service, leading to indictment and criminal prosecution, which he challenged as a conscientious objector. The FBI arrested him in April, and it took several years for courts to resolve the matter.

After months of recording and media hype, &quot;Smile&quot; was shelved for personal, technical, and legal reasons. A February 1967 lawsuit seeking $255,000 (equivalent to $ in ) was launched against Capitol Records over neglected royalty payments. Within the lawsuit was an attempt to terminate the band&#x27;s contract with Capitol before its November 1969 expiry. Many of Wilson&#x27;s associates, including Parks and Anderle, disassociated themselves from the group by April 1967. Brian later said: &quot;Time can be spent in the studio to the point where you get so next to it, you don&#x27;t know where you are with it—you decide to just chuck it for a while.&quot;

In the decades following &quot;Smile&quot;″s non-release, it became the subject of intense speculation and mystique and the most legendary unreleased album in pop music history. Many of the album&#x27;s advocates believe that had it been released, it would have altered the group&#x27;s direction and cemented them at the vanguard of rock innovators. In 2011, &quot;Uncut&quot; magazine staff voted &quot;Smile&quot; the &quot;greatest bootleg recording of all time&quot;.

=== 1967–1969: Faltered popularity and Brian&#x27;s reduced involvement ===

====&quot;Smiley Smile&quot; and &quot;Wild Honey&quot;====
From 1965 to 1967, the Beach Boys had developed a musical and lyrical sophistication that contrasted their work from before and after. This divide was further solidified by the difference in sound between their albums and their stage performances. This resulted in a split fanbase corresponding to two distinct musical markets. One group enjoys the band&#x27;s early work as a wholesome representation of American popular culture from before the political and social movements brought on in the mid-1960s. The other group also appreciates the early songs for their energy and complexity, but not as much as the band&#x27;s ambitious work that was created during the formative psychedelic era. At the time, rock music journalists typically valued the Beach Boys&#x27; early records over their experimental work.

In May 1967, the Beach Boys attempted to tour Europe with four extra musicians brought from the US, but were stopped by the British musicians&#x27; union. The tour went on without the extra support, and critics described their performances as &quot;amateurish&quot; and &quot;floundering&quot;. At the last minute, the Beach Boys declined to headline the Monterey Pop Festival, an event held in June. According to David Leaf, &quot;Monterey was a gathering place for the &#x27;far out&#x27; sounds of the &#x27;new&#x27; rock ... and it is thought that [their] non-appearance was what really turned the &#x27;underground&#x27; tide against them.&quot; Fan magazines speculated that the group was on the verge of breaking up. Detractors called the band the &quot;Bleach Boys&quot; and &quot;the California Hypes&quot; as media focus shifted from Los Angeles to the happenings in San Francisco. As authenticity became a higher concern among critics, the group&#x27;s legitimacy in rock music became an oft-repeated criticism, especially since their early songs appeared to celebrate a politically unconscious youth culture.

Although &quot;Smile&quot; had been cancelled, the Beach Boys were still under pressure and a contractual obligation to record and present an album to Capitol. Carl remembered: &quot;Brian just said, &#x27;I can&#x27;t do this. We&#x27;re going to make a homespun version of [&quot;Smile&quot;] instead. We&#x27;re just going to take it easy. I&#x27;ll get in the pool and sing. Or let&#x27;s go in the gym and do our parts.&#x27; That was &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;.&quot; Sessions for the new album lasted from June to July 1967 at Brian&#x27;s new makeshift home studio. Most of the album featured the Beach Boys playing their own instruments, rather than the session musicians employed in much of their previous work. It was the first album for which production was credited to the entire group instead of Brian alone.

In July 1967, lead single &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; was issued, arriving after months of public anticipation, and reached number 12 in US. It was met with general confusion and underwhelming reviews, and in the &quot;NME&quot;, Jimi Hendrix famously dismissed it as a &quot;psychedelic barbershop quartet&quot;. By then, the group&#x27;s lawsuit with Capitol was resolved, and it was agreed that &quot;Smile&quot; would not be the band&#x27;s next album. In August, the group embarked on a two-date tour of Hawaii. The shows saw Brian make a brief return to live performance, as Bruce Johnston chose to take a temporary break from the band during the summer of 1967, feeling that the atmosphere within the band &quot;had all got too weird&quot;. The performances were filmed and recorded with the intention of releasing a live album, &quot;Lei&#x27;d in Hawaii&quot;, which was also left unfinished and unreleased. The general record-buying public came to view the music made after this time as the point marking the band&#x27;s artistic decline.

&quot;Smiley Smile&quot; was released on September 18, 1967, and peaked at number 41 in the US, making it their worst-selling album to that date. Critics and fans were generally underwhelmed by the album. According to Scott Schinder, the album was released to &quot;general incomprehension. While &quot;Smile&quot; may have divided the Beach Boys&#x27; fans had it been released, &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; merely baffled them.&quot; The group was virtually blacklisted by the music press, to the extent that reviews of the group&#x27;s records were either withheld from publication or published long after the release dates. When released in the UK in November, it performed better, reaching number 9. Over the years, the album gathered a reputation as one of the best &quot;chill-out&quot; albums to listen to during an LSD comedown. In 1974, &quot;NME&quot; voted it the 64th-greatest album of all time.

The Beach Boys immediately recorded a new album, &quot;Wild Honey&quot;, an excursion into soul music, and a self-conscious attempt to &quot;regroup&quot; themselves as a rock band in opposition to their more orchestral affairs of the past. Its music differs in many ways from previous Beach Boys records: it contains very little group singing compared to previous albums, and mainly features Brian singing at his piano. Again, the Beach Boys recorded mostly at his home studio. Love reflected that &quot;Wild Honey&quot; was &quot;completely out of the mainstream for what was going on at that time ... and that was the idea&quot;.

&quot;Wild Honey&quot; was released on December 18, 1967, in competition with the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; and the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot;. It had a higher chart placing than &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;, but still failed to make the top-twenty and remained on the charts for only 15 weeks. As with &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;, contemporary critics viewed it as inconsequential, and it alienated fans whose expectations had been raised by &quot;Smile&quot;. That month, Mike Love told a British journalist: &quot;Brian has been rethinking our recording program and in any case we all have a much greater say nowadays in what we turn out in the studio.&quot;

====&quot;Friends&quot;, &quot;20/20&quot;, and Manson affair====
The Beach Boys were at their lowest popularity in the late 1960s, and their cultural standing was especially worsened by their public image, which remained incongruous with their peers&#x27; &quot;heavier&quot; music. At the end of 1967, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; co-founder and editor Jann Wenner printed an influential article that denounced the Beach Boys as &quot;just one prominent example of a group that has gotten hung up on trying to catch The Beatles. It&#x27;s a pointless pursuit.&quot; The article had the effect of excluding the group among serious rock fans and such controversy followed them into the next year. Capitol continued to bill them as &quot;America&#x27;s Top Surfin&#x27; Group!&quot; and expected Brian to write more beachgoing songs for the yearly summer markets. From 1968 onward, his songwriting output declined substantially, but the public narrative of &quot;Brian as leader&quot; continued. The group also stopped wearing their longtime striped-shirt stage uniforms in favor of matching white, polyester suits that resembled a Las Vegas show band&#x27;s.

After meeting Maharishi Mahesh Yogi at a UNICEF Variety Gala in Paris, Love and other high-profile celebrities such as the Beatles and Donovan traveled to Rishikesh, India, in February–March 1968. The following Beach Boys album, &quot;Friends&quot;, had songs influenced by the Transcendental Meditation the Maharishi taught. In support of &quot;Friends&quot;, Love arranged for the Beach Boys to tour with the Maharishi in the US. Starting on May 3, 1968, the tour lasted five shows and was canceled when the Maharishi withdrew to fulfill film contracts. Because of disappointing audience numbers and the Maharishi&#x27;s withdrawal, 24 tour dates were canceled at a cost estimated at $250,000. &quot;Friends&quot;, released on June 24, peaked at number 126 in the US. In August, Capitol issued an album of Beach Boys backing tracks, &quot;Stack-o-Tracks&quot;. It was the first Beach Boys LP that failed to chart in the US and UK.

In June 1968, Dennis befriended Charles Manson, an aspiring singer-songwriter, and their relationship lasted for several months. Dennis bought him time at Brian&#x27;s home studio, where recording sessions were attempted while Brian stayed in his room. Dennis then proposed that Manson be signed to Brother Records. Brian reportedly disliked Manson, and a deal was never made. In July 1968, the group released the single &quot;Do It Again&quot;, which lyrically harkened back to their earlier surf songs. Around this time, Brian admitted himself to a psychiatric hospital; his bandmates wrote and produced material in his absence. Released in January 1969, the album &quot;20/20&quot; mixed new material with outtakes and leftovers from recent albums; Brian produced virtually none of the newer recordings.

The Beach Boys recorded one song by Manson without his involvement: &quot;Cease to Exist&quot;, rewritten as &quot;Never Learn Not to Love&quot;, which was included on &quot;20/20&quot;. As his cult of followers took over Dennis&#x27;s home, Dennis gradually distanced himself from Manson. According to Leaf, &quot;The entire Wilson family reportedly feared for their lives.&quot;

In August, the Manson Family committed the Tate–LaBianca murders. According to Jon Parks, the band&#x27;s tour manager, it was widely suspected in the Hollywood community that Manson was responsible for the murders, and it had been known that Manson had been involved with the Beach Boys, causing the band to be viewed as pariahs for a time. In November, police apprehended Manson, and his connection with the Beach Boys received media attention. He was later convicted for several counts of murder and conspiracy to murder.

==== Selling of the band&#x27;s publishing ====

In April 1969, the band revisited its 1967 lawsuit against Capitol after it alleged an audit revealed the band was owed over $2 million for unpaid royalties and production duties. In May, Brian told the music press that the group&#x27;s funds were depleted to the point that it was considering filing for bankruptcy at the end of the year, which &quot;Disc &amp; Music Echo&quot; called &quot;stunning news&quot; and a &quot;tremendous shock on the American pop scene&quot;. Brian hoped that the success of a forthcoming single, &quot;Break Away&quot;, would mend the financial issues. The song, written and produced by Brian and Murry, reached number 63 in the US and number 6 in the UK, and Brian&#x27;s remarks to the press ultimately thwarted long-simmering contract negotiations with Deutsche Grammophon. The group&#x27;s Capitol contract expired two weeks later with one more album still due. &quot;Live in London&quot;, a live album recorded in December 1968, was released in the UK and a few other countries in 1970 to fulfil the contract, although it would not see US release until 1976. After the contract was completed Capitol deleted the Beach Boys&#x27; catalog from print, effectively cutting off their royalty flow. The lawsuit was later settled in their favor and they acquired the rights to their post-1965 catalog.

In August, Sea of Tunes, the Beach Boys&#x27; catalog, was sold to Irving Almo Music for $700,000 (equivalent to $ in ). According to his wife, Marilyn Wilson, Brian was devastated by the sale. Over the years, the catalog generated more than $100 million in publishing royalties, none of which Murry or the band members ever received. That same month, Carl, Dennis, Love, and Jardine sought a permanent replacement for Johnston, with Johnston unaware of this search. They approached Carl&#x27;s brother-in-law Billy Hinsche, who declined the offer to focus on his college studies.

===1970–1978: Reprise era===

====&quot;Sunflower&quot;, &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot;, &quot;Carl and the Passions&quot;, and &quot;Holland&quot;====

The group was signed to Reprise Records in 1970. Scott Schinder described the label as &quot;probably the hippest and most artist-friendly major label of the time&quot;. The deal was brokered by Van Dyke Parks, who was then employed as a multimedia executive at Warner Music Group. Reprise&#x27;s contract stipulated Brian&#x27;s proactive involvement with the band in all albums. By the time the Beach Boys&#x27; tenure ended with Capitol in 1969, they had sold 65 million records worldwide, closing the decade as the most commercially successful American group in popular music.

After recording over 30 different songs and going through several album titles, their first LP for Reprise, &quot;Sunflower&quot;, was released on August 31, 1970. &quot;Sunflower&quot; featured a strong group presence with significant writing contributions from all six band members. Brian was active during this period, writing or co-writing seven of &quot;Sunflower&quot;&#x27;s 12 songs and performing at half of the band&#x27;s domestic concerts in 1970. The album received critical acclaim in both the US and the UK. This was offset by the album reaching only number 151 on US record charts during a four-week stay, becoming one of the worst-selling of the Beach Boys&#x27; albums at that point. Fans generally regard the LP as the Beach Boys&#x27; finest post-&quot;Pet Sounds&quot; album. In 2003, it placed at number 380 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s &quot;Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; list.

In mid-1970, the Beach Boys hired radio presenter Jack Rieley as their manager. One of his initiatives was to encourage the band to record songs featuring more socially conscious lyrics. He also requested the completion of &quot;Smile&quot; track &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; and arranged a guest appearance at a Grateful Dead concert at Bill Graham&#x27;s Fillmore East in April 1971 to foreground the Beach Boys&#x27; transition into the counterculture. During this time, the group ceased wearing matching uniforms on stage, while Dennis took time to star alongside James Taylor, Laurie Bird, and Warren Oates in the cult film &quot;Two-Lane Blacktop&quot;, released in 1971. Later in 1971, Dennis injured his hand, leaving him temporarily unable to play the drums. He continued in the band, singing and occasionally playing keyboards, while Ricky Fataar, formally of the Flames, took over on drums. In July, the American music press rated the Beach Boys &quot;the hottest grossing act&quot; in the country, alongside Grand Funk Railroad. The band filmed a concert for ABC-TV in Central Park, which aired as &quot;Good Vibrations from Central Park&quot; on August 19.

On August 30, the band released &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot;, which was moderately successful, reaching the US top-thirty, a marked improvement over their recent releases. While the record charted, the Beach Boys added to their renewed fame by performing a near-sellout set at Carnegie Hall; their live shows during this era included reworked arrangements of many of their previous songs, with their set lists culling from &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; and &quot;Smile&quot;. On October 28, the Beach Boys were the featured cover story on that date&#x27;s issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. It included the first part of a lengthy two-part interview, titled &quot;The Beach Boys: A California Saga&quot;, conducted by Tom Nolan and David Felton.

Bruce Johnston left the Beach Boys in early 1972, with Fataar and another ex-Flames member, singer and guitarist Blondie Chaplin, becoming official members of the band. The new line-up released &quot;Carl and the Passions – &quot;So Tough&quot;&quot; in May 1972. The original US release was a double album, the second disc being a reissue of &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;. After the upswing of &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot;, &quot;Carl and the Passions&quot; was relatively unsuccessful in the US, charting at number 50. It was more successful in the UK, where it was issued as a single album without &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, peaking at number 25. The next album, &quot;Holland&quot;, was released in January 1973. Reprise initially rejected the album, feeling it lacked a strong single. Following the intervention of Van Dyke Parks, this resulted in the inclusion of &quot;Sail On, Sailor&quot;. Reprise approved, and the resulting album peaked at number 37. Brian&#x27;s musical children&#x27;s story, &quot;Mount Vernon and Fairway&quot;, was included with the album as a bonus EP.

====Greatest hits LPs, touring resurgence, and Caribou sessions====
After &quot;Holland&quot;, the group maintained a touring regimen, captured on the double live album &quot;The Beach Boys in Concert&quot; released in November 1973, but recorded very little in the studio through 1975. Several months earlier, they had announced that they would complete &quot;Smile&quot;, but this never came to fruition, and plans for its release were once again abandoned. Following Murry&#x27;s death in June 1973, Brian retreated into his bedroom and withdrew further into drug abuse, alcoholism, chain smoking, and overeating. In October, the band fired Rieley. Rieley&#x27;s position was succeeded by Mike Love&#x27;s brother, Stephen, and Chicago manager James William Guercio. Chaplin and Fataar left the band in December 1973 and November 1974, respectively, with Dennis returning to drums following Fataar&#x27;s departure.

The Beach Boys&#x27; greatest hits compilation album &quot;Endless Summer&quot; was released in June 1974 to unexpected success, becoming the band&#x27;s second number 1 US album in October. The LP had a 155-week chart run, selling over 3 million copies. The Beach Boys became the number-one act in the US, propelling themselves from opening for Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young in the summer of 1974 to headliners selling out basketball arenas in a matter of weeks. Guercio prevailed upon the group to swap out newer songs with older material in their concert setlists, partly to accommodate their growing audience and the demand for their early hits. Later in the year, members of the band appeared as guests on Chicago&#x27;s hit &quot;Wishing You Were Here&quot;. At the end of 1974, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; proclaimed the Beach Boys &quot;Band of the Year&quot; based on the strength of their live performances.

To capitalize on their sudden resurgence in popularity, the Beach Boys accepted Guercio&#x27;s invitation to record their next Reprise album at his Caribou Ranch studio, located around the mountains of Nederland, Colorado. These October 1974 sessions marked the group&#x27;s return to the studio after a 21-month period of virtual inactivity, but the proceedings were cut short after Brian had insisted on returning to his home in Los Angeles. With the project put on hold, the Beach Boys spent most of the next year on the road playing college football stadiums and basketball arenas. The only Beach Boys recording of 1974 to see release at the time was the Christmas single &quot;Child of Winter&quot;, recorded upon the group&#x27;s return to Los Angeles in November and released the following month.

Over the summer of 1975, the touring group played a co-headlining series of concert dates with Chicago, a pairing that was nicknamed &quot;Beachago&quot;. The tour was massively successful and restored the Beach Boys&#x27; profitability to what it had been in the mid-1960s. Although another joint tour with Chicago had been planned for the summer of 1976, the Beach Boys&#x27; association with Guercio and his Caribou Management company ended in early 1976. Stephen Love subsequently took over as the band&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; business manager.

====&quot;15 Big Ones&quot;, &quot;Love You&quot;, and &quot;Adult/Child&quot;====

Early in 1975, Brian signed a production deal with California Music, a Los Angeles collective that included Bruce Johnston and Gary Usher, but was drawn away by the Beach Boys&#x27; pressing demands for a new album. In October, Marilyn persuaded Brian to admit himself to the care of psychologist Eugene Landy, who kept him from indulging in substance abuse with constant supervision. Brian was kept in the program until December 1976.

At the end of January 1976, the Beach Boys returned to the studio with Brian producing once again. Brian decided the band should do an album of rock and roll and doo wop standards. Carl and Dennis disagreed, feeling that an album of originals was far more ideal, while Love and Jardine wanted the album out as quickly as possible. To highlight Brian&#x27;s recovery and his return to writing and producing, Stephen devised a promotional campaign with the tagline &quot;Brian Is Back!&quot;, and paid the Rogers &amp; Cowan publicity agency $3,500 per month to implement it. The band also commissioned an NBC-TV special, later known as &quot;The Beach Boys: It&#x27;s OK!&quot;, that was produced by &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; creator Lorne Michaels.

Released on July 5, 1976, &quot;15 Big Ones&quot; was generally disliked by fans and critics, as well as Carl and Dennis, who disparaged the album to the press. The album peaked at number 8 in the US, becoming their first top-ten album of new material since &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, and their highest-charting studio album since &quot;Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!)&quot;. Lead single &quot;Rock and Roll Music&quot; peaked at number 5 – their highest chart ranking since &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;.

From late-1976 to early-1977, Brian made sporadic public appearances and produced the band&#x27;s next album, &quot;The Beach Boys Love You&quot;. He regarded it as a spiritual successor to &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, namely because of the autobiographical lyrics. Released on April 11, 1977, &quot;Love You&quot; peaked at number 53 in the US and number 28 in the UK. Critically, it was widely praised, though it initially met with polarized reactions from the public. Numerous esteemed critics penned favorable reviews, but casual listeners generally found the album&#x27;s idiosyncratic sound to be a detriment.

&quot;Adult/Child&quot;, the intended follow-up to &quot;Love You&quot;, was completed, but the release was vetoed by Love and Jardine. According to Stan Love, when his brother Mike heard the album, Mike turned to Brian and asked: &quot;What the fuck are you doing?&quot; Some of the unreleased songs on &quot;Adult/Child&quot; later saw individual release on subsequent Beach Boys albums and compilations. Following this period, his concert appearances with the band gradually diminished and their performances were occasionally erratic.

====CBS signing and &quot;M.I.U. Album&quot;====
At the beginning of 1977, the Beach Boys had enjoyed their most lucrative concert tours ever, with the band playing in packed stadiums and earning up to $150,000 per show. Concurrently, the band was the subject of a record company bidding war, as their contract with Warner Bros. had been set to expire soon. Stephen Love arranged for the Beach Boys to sign an $8 million deal with CBS Records on March 1. Numerous stipulations were given in the CBS contract, including that Brian was required to write at least four songs per album, co-write at least 70% of all the tracks, and produce or co-produce alongside his brothers. Another part of the deal required the group to play thirty concerts a year in the U.S., in addition to one tour in Australia and Japan, and two tours in Europe.

Within weeks of the CBS contract, Stephen was effectively fired by the band, with one of the alleged reasons being that Mike had not permitted Stephen to sign on his behalf while at a TM retreat in Switzerland. For Stephen&#x27;s replacement, the group hired Carl&#x27;s friend Henry Lazarus, an entertainment business owner that had no prior experience in the music industry. Lazarus arranged a major European tour for the Beach Boys, starting in late July, with stops in Germany, Switzerland, and France. Due to poor planning, the tour was cancelled shortly before it began, as Lazarus had failed to complete the necessary paperwork. The group subsequently fired Lazarus and were sued by many of the concert promoters, with losses of $200,000 in preliminary expenses and $550,000 in potential revenue.

In July, the Beach Boys played a concert at Wembley Stadium that was notable for the fact that, during the show, Mike attacked Brian with a piano bench onstage in front of over 15,000 attendees. In August, Mike and Jardine persuaded Stephen to return as the group&#x27;s manager, a decision that Carl and Dennis had strongly opposed. By this point, the band had effectively split into two camps; Dennis and Carl on one side, Mike and Jardine on the other, with Brian remaining neutral. These two opposing contingents within the group – known among their associates as the &quot;free-livers&quot; and the &quot;meditators&quot; – were traveling in different planes, using different hotels, and rarely speaking to each other. According to Love, &quot;the terms &#x27;smokers&#x27; and &#x27;nonsmokers&#x27; were also used&quot;.

On September 3, after completing the final date of a northeastern US tour, the internal wrangling came to a head. Following a confrontation on an airport apron – a spectacle that a bystanding &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; journalist compared to the ending of &quot;Casablanca&quot; – Dennis declared that he had left the band. The group was broken up until a meeting at Brian&#x27;s house on September 17. In light of the lucrative CBS contract, the parties negotiated a settlement resulting in Love gaining control of Brian&#x27;s vote in the group, allowing Love and Jardine to outvote Carl and Dennis on any matter.

The group had still owed one more album for Reprise. Released in September 1978, &quot;M.I.U. Album&quot; was recorded at Maharishi International University in Iowa at the suggestion of Love. The band originally attempted to record a Christmas album, to be titled &quot;Merry Christmas from the Beach Boys&quot;, but this idea was rejected by Reprise. These Christmas recordings would eventually be released in 1998 as part of the &quot;Ultimate Christmas&quot; compilation album. Dennis and Carl made limited contributions to &quot;M.I.U. Album&quot;; the album was produced by Jardine and Ron Altbach, with Brian credited as &quot;executive producer&quot;. Dennis started to withdraw from the group to focus on his second solo album, &quot;Bambu&quot;, which was shelved just as alcoholism and marital problems overcame all three Wilson brothers. Carl appeared intoxicated during concerts (especially at appearances for their 1978 Australia tour) and Brian gradually slid back into addiction and an unhealthy lifestyle. Stephen was fired shortly after the Australia tour partly due to an incident in which Brian&#x27;s bodyguards, Rocky Pamplin and Stan Love, physically assaulted Dennis.

===1978–1998: Continued recording and Brian&#x27;s estrangement===

====&quot;L.A. (Light Album)&quot; and &quot;Keepin&#x27; the Summer Alive&quot;====

The group&#x27;s first two albums for CBS, 1979&#x27;s &quot;L.A. (Light Album)&quot; and 1980&#x27;s &quot;Keepin&#x27; the Summer Alive&quot;, struggled in the US, charting at 100 and 75 respectively, though the band did manage a top-forty single from &quot;L.A.&quot; with &quot;Good Timin&#x27;&quot;. The recording of these albums saw Bruce Johnston return to the band, initially solely as a producer and eventually as a full-time band member. In-between the two albums, the group contributed the song &quot;It&#x27;s a Beautiful Day&quot; to the soundtrack of the film &quot;Americathon&quot;. In an April 1980 interview, Carl reflected that &quot;the last two years have been the most important and difficult time of our career. We were at the ultimate crossroads. We had to decide whether what we had been involved in since we were teenagers had lost its meaning. We asked ourselves and each other the difficult questions we&#x27;d often avoided in the past.&quot; By the next year, he left the touring group because of unhappiness with the band&#x27;s nostalgia format and lackluster live performances, subsequently pursuing a solo career. He stated: &quot;I haven&#x27;t quit the Beach Boys but I do not plan on touring with them until they decide that 1981 means as much to them as 1961.&quot; Carl returned in May 1982, after approximately 14 months of being away, on the condition that the group reconsider their rehearsal and touring policies and refrain from &quot;Las Vegas-type&quot; engagements.
On June 21, 1980, the Beach Boys performed a concert at Knebworth, England, which featured a slightly intoxicated Dennis. The concert would later be released as a live album titled &quot;Good Timin&#x27;: Live at Knebworth England 1980&quot; in 2002. In 1981, the band scored a surprise US top-twenty hit when their cover of the Del-Vikings&#x27; &quot;Come Go with Me&quot;, from the three year old &quot;M.I.U. Album&quot;, was released as a single from &quot;Ten Years of Harmony&quot;, a double compilation album focusing on the Reprise and CBS years.

In late 1982, Eugene Landy was once more employed as Brian&#x27;s therapist, and a more radical program was undertaken to try to restore Brian to health. This involved removing him from the group on November 5, 1982, at the behest of Carl, Love, and Jardine, in addition to putting him on a rigorous diet and health regimen. Coupled with long, extreme counseling sessions, this therapy was successful in bringing Brian back to physical health, slimming down from to .

====Death of Dennis, &quot;The Beach Boys&quot;, and &quot;Still Cruisin&quot;″====
By the late 1970s and early 1980s, Dennis had been embroiled in successive failed romantic relationships, including a tense and short-lived relationship with Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s Christine McVie, and found himself in severe economic trouble resulting in the sale of Brother Studios, established by the Wilson brothers in 1974 and where &quot;Pacific Ocean Blue&quot; was produced, and the forfeiture of his beloved yacht. To cope with the combination of devastating losses, Dennis heavily abused alcohol, cocaine, and heroin and was, by 1983, homeless and lived a nomadic lifestyle. He was often seen spending much of his time wandering the Los Angeles coast and often missed Beach Boys performances. By this point, he had lost his voice and much of his ability to play drums.

In 1983, tensions between Dennis and Love escalated to the point that each obtained a restraining order against the other. Following Brian&#x27;s readmission for Landy&#x27;s treatment, Dennis was given an ultimatum after his last performance in November 1983 to check into rehab for his alcohol problems or be banned from performing live with the band again. Dennis checked into rehab for his chance to get sober, but on December 28, he drowned at the age of 39 in Marina del Rey while diving from a friend&#x27;s boat trying to recover items that he had previously thrown overboard in a fit of rage.

The Beach Boys spent the next several years touring, often playing in front of large audiences, and recording songs for film soundtracks and various artists compilations. One new studio album, the self-titled &quot;The Beach Boys&quot;, appeared in 1985 and proved a modest success, becoming their highest-charting album in the US since &quot;15 Big Ones&quot;. &quot;The Beach Boys&quot; was the group&#x27;s final album for CBS. The following year they returned to Capitol with a 25th anniversary greatest hits album &quot;Made in U.S.A&quot;, which featured two new tracks, &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll to the Rescue&quot; and a cover of the Mamas and the Papas&#x27; &quot;California Dreamin&#x27;&quot;, with the latter featuring Roger McGuinn of the Byrds on lead guitar. &quot;Made in U.S.A&quot; eventually went double platinum.

Commenting on his relationship to the band in 1988, Brian said that he avoided his family at Landy&#x27;s suggestion, adding that &quot;Although we stay together as a group, as people we&#x27;re a far cry from friends.&quot; Mike denied the accusation that he and the band were keeping Brian from participating with the group. In 1987 the band scored a top-twenty single in collaboration with rap group the Fat Boys, on their cover of the Surfaris&#x27; &quot;Wipeout!&quot;. The following year, the Beach Boys unexpectedly claimed their first US number 1 single in 22 years with &quot;Kokomo&quot;, which topped the chart for one week. The track was featured in the film &quot;Cocktail&quot;. Both &quot;Wipeout!&quot; and &quot;Kokomo&quot; were included on the band&#x27;s next album, 1989&#x27;s &quot;Still Cruisin&#x27;&quot;, which went platinum in the US.

During 1990 and 1991, the group&#x27;s original Capitol-era albums (&quot;Surfin&#x27; Safari&quot; through &quot;Live in London&quot;) were released on CD for the first time, with &quot;The Beach Boys&#x27; Christmas Album&quot; and &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; being individual titles, and the remaining albums issued as two-fers (two albums on one CD). The Reprise and CBS albums (&quot;Sunflower&quot; through &quot;The Beach Boys&quot;) would eventually receive the same treatment in 2000. In 1991 the band contributed a cover of &quot;Crocodile Rock&quot; to the Elton John and Bernie Taupin tribute album &quot;Two Rooms&quot;.

====Lawsuits, &quot;Summer in Paradise&quot;, and &quot;Stars and Stripes, Vol. 1&quot;====

Carlin summarized: &quot;Once surfin&#x27; pin-ups, they remade themselves as avant-garde pop artists, then psychedelic oracles. After that they were down-home hippies, then retro-hip icons. Eventually they devolved into none of the above: a kind of perpetual-motion nostalgia machine.&quot; Music journalist Erik Davis wrote in 1990: &quot;the Beach Boys are either dead, deranged, or dinosaurs; their records are Eurocentric, square, unsampled; they&#x27;ve made too much money to merit hip revisionism&quot;. In 1992, critic Jim Miller wrote: &quot;They have become a figment of their own past, prisoners of their unflagging popularity—incongruous emblems of a sunny myth of eternal youth belied by much of their own best music. ... The group is still largely identified with its hits from the early Sixties.&quot;

Love filed a defamation lawsuit against Brian due to how he was presented in Brian&#x27;s 1992 memoir &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t It Be Nice: My Own Story&quot;. Its publisher HarperCollins settled the suit for $1.5 million. He said that the suit allowed his lawyer &quot;to gain access to the transcripts of Brian&#x27;s interviews with his [book] collaborator, Todd Gold. Those interviews affirmed—according to Brian—that I had been the inspiration of the group and that I had written many of the songs that [would soon be] in dispute.&quot; Other defamation lawsuits were filed by Carl, Brother Records, and the Wilsons&#x27; mother Audree. With Love and Brian unable to determine exactly what Love was properly owed in royalties, Love sued Brian in 1992, winning $13 million in 1994 for lost royalties. 35 of the group&#x27;s songs were then amended to credit Love. He later called it &quot;almost certainly the largest case of fraud in music history&quot;.

The day after California courts issued a restraining order between Brian and Landy, Brian phoned Sire Records staff producer Andy Paley to collaborate on new material tentatively for the Beach Boys. After losing the songwriting credits lawsuit with Love, Brian told &quot;MOJO&quot; in February 1995: &quot;Mike and I are just cool. There&#x27;s a lot of shit Andy and I got written for him. I just had to get through that goddamn trial!&quot; In April, it was unclear whether the project would turn into a Wilson solo album, a Beach Boys album, or a combination of the two. The project ultimately disintegrated. Instead, Brian and his bandmates recorded &quot;Stars and Stripes Vol. 1&quot;, an album of country music stars covering Beach Boys songs, with co-production helmed by River North Records owner Joe Thomas. Afterward, the group discussed finishing the album &quot;Smile&quot;, but Carl rejected the idea, fearing that it would cause Brian another nervous breakdown.

1997 saw the release of the critically-acclaimed 4-CD box set &quot;The Pet Sounds Sessions&quot;. A further archival release, &quot;Ultimate Christmas&quot;, followed in 1998.

=== 1998–present: Love-led tours and brief reunion ===
==== Carl&#x27;s death and band name litigation ====
Early in 1997, Carl was diagnosed with lung and brain cancer after years of heavy smoking. Despite his terminal condition, Carl continued to perform with the band on its 1997 summer tour (a double-bill with the band Chicago) while undergoing chemotherapy. During performances, he sat on a stool and needed oxygen after every song. Carl died on February 6, 1998, at the age of 51, two months after the death of the Wilsons&#x27; mother, Audree.

After Carl&#x27;s death, Jardine left the touring line-up and began to perform regularly with his band &quot;Beach Boys: Family &amp; Friends&quot; until he ran into legal issues for using the name without license. Meanwhile, Jardine sued Love, claiming that he had been excluded from their concerts, BRI, through its longtime attorney, Ed McPherson, sued Jardine in Federal Court. Jardine, in turn, counter-claimed against BRI for wrongful termination. Courts ruled in Love&#x27;s favor, denying Jardine the use of the Beach Boys name in any fashion. However, Jardine proceeded to appeal this decision in addition to seeking $4 million in damages. The California Court of Appeal proceeded to rule that &quot;Love acted wrongfully in freezing Jardine out of touring under the Beach Boys name&quot;, allowing Jardine to continue with his lawsuit. The case ended up being settled outside of court with the terms not disclosed. BRI ultimately prevailed.

Jardine&#x27;s final appearance with the band for more than a decade occurred on May 9, 1998, which was the final official Beach Boys show performed before the license dispute. During the license dispute, Love (with Marks) toured as &quot;The California Beach Band&quot;; it was previously believed he did so &quot;America&#x27;s Band&quot;, but this has since been disproven. Love then continued touring with Johnston (and David Marks, until he left the band again in 1999, due to health issues when he was diagnosed with hepatitis C), after securing a license from BRI, with the first performance of the &#x27;reorganized&#x27; Love and Johnston-led touring band on July 4, 1998.

In 2000, ABC-TV premiered a two-part television miniseries, &quot;The Beach Boys: An American Family&quot;, that dramatized the Beach Boys&#x27; story. It was produced by &quot;Full House&quot; actor John Stamos, and was criticized by numerous parties, including Brian Wilson, for historical inaccuracies.

&quot;Sounds of Summer: The Very Best of the Beach Boys&quot;, a greatest hits compilation, was released in 2003, eventually going multi-platinum. In 2004, Wilson recorded and released his solo album &quot;Brian Wilson Presents Smile&quot;, a reinterpretation of the unfinished &quot;Smile&quot; project. That September, Wilson issued a free CD through the &quot;Mail On Sunday&quot; that included Beach Boys songs he had recently rerecorded, five of which he co-authored with Love. The 10 track compilation had 2.6 million copies distributed and prompted Love to file a lawsuit in November 2005; he claimed the promotion hurt the sales of the original recordings and that his image was used for the CD. Wilson&#x27;s wife Melinda alleged that, during the deposition, Love turned to Wilson and remarked: &quot;you better start writing a real big hit because you&#x27;re going to have to write me a real big check&quot;. Love&#x27;s suit was dismissed in 2007 when a judge determined that there were no triable issues and that the case was without merit.

In 2006, Brian Wilson, Love, Jardine, Marks, and Johnston participated in a non-performing reunion on the rooftop of the Capitol Records building in Los Angeles to celebrate that &quot;Sounds of Summer&quot; had been certified double-platinum. Later that year, Jardine joined Brian Wilson and his band for a short tour celebrating the 40th anniversary of &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;.

In 2008, Marks briefly reunited with Love and Johnston&#x27;s touring band for a tour of Europe.

In 2010, Jardine released &quot;A Postcard from California&quot;, his solo debut, in June 2010 (re-released with two extra tracks on April 3, 2012). The album features contributions from Beach Boys Brian Wilson, Carl Wilson (posthumously), Bruce Johnston, David Marks, and Mike Love. Other guests with Beach Boys connections included Glen Campbell, Scott Mathews, Stephen Kalinich, and Gerry Beckley and Dewey Bunnell of America. Also in 2010, Brian Wilson and Jardine sang on &quot;We Are the World 25: for Haiti&quot;, a new recording of &quot;We Are the World&quot; (with partially revised lyrics), which was released as a charity single to benefit the population of Haiti.

Jardine made his first appearance with the Beach Boys touring band in more than 10 years in 2011 at a tribute concert for Ronald Reagan&#x27;s 100th birthday; at this concert, he sang lead on &quot;Help Me, Rhonda&quot; and &quot;Sloop John B&quot;. He made a handful of other appearances with Love and Johnston&#x27;s touring band in preparation for a reunion.

==== &quot;The Smile Sessions&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s Why God Made the Radio&quot;, and 50th anniversary reunion tour ====
On October 31, 2011, Capitol released a double album and box set dedicated to the &quot;Smile&quot; recordings in the form of &quot;The Smile Sessions&quot;. The album garnered universal critical acclaim and charted in both the US &quot;Billboard&quot; and UK top-thirty. It went on to win Best Historical Album at the 2013 Grammy Awards.

On December 16, 2011, it was announced that Wilson, Love, Jardine, Johnston, and David Marks would reunite for a new album and 50th anniversary tour. On February 12, 2012, the Beach Boys performed at the 2012 Grammy Awards, in what was billed as a &quot;special performance&quot; by organizers. It marked the group&#x27;s first live performance to include Wilson since 1996, Jardine since 1998, and Marks since 1999. Released on June 5, &quot;That&#x27;s Why God Made the Radio&quot; debuted at number 3 on the US charts, expanding the group&#x27;s span of &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 top-ten albums across 49 years and one week, passing the Beatles with 47 years of top-ten albums. Critics generally regarded the album as an &quot;uneven&quot; collection, with most of the praise centered on its closing musical suite.

During the tour, in May 2012, when asked about the future held for the band and its reunion after the scheduled end of the tour in September, Love stated that &quot;We&#x27;re looking at our present and future. I think we&#x27;re going to be doing this again with Brian for a long time.&quot; Wilson said that he had begun planning for another Beach Boys album for the band would record after the tour. On June 1, 2012, Love received an e-mail from Ledbetter stating &quot;no more shows for Wilson&quot;. Love then began accepting invitations for when the reunion was over. Johnston told reporter Mark Dillon in mid-June that the current tour was &quot;a one-time event. You&#x27;re not going to see this next year. I&#x27;m busy next year doing my thing with Mike.&quot; On June 25, Ledbetter sent another e-mail asking to disregard her last message, but by then, Love claimed that &quot;it was too late. We had booked other concerts, and promoters had begun selling tickets.&quot;

Despite this, in July, Love stated: &quot;There&#x27;s talk of us going and doing a return to the Grammys next year, and there&#x27;s talk about doing another album together. There&#x27;s nothing in stone, but there&#x27;s a lot of ideas being floated around. So after this year, after completing the 50th anniversary reunion, we&#x27;ll entertain doing some more studio work and see what we can come up with and can do in the future.&quot; Love said that Wilson and producer Joe Thomas had over 80 hours of material recorded, much of it culled from material they were working on around the time of Wilson&#x27;s 1998 &quot;Imagination&quot; album that &quot;were always songs he had earmarked for the Beach Boys&quot; and that their label Capitol Records was excited by the band&#x27;s reunion and was encouraging the band for more new music and more tour dates.

Ultimately, the reunion tour ended in September 2012 as planned, after a final show on September 28, but amid erroneous rumors that Love had dismissed Wilson from the Beach Boys. At this time, Love and Johnston had announced via a press release that following the end of the reunion tour the Beach Boys would revert to the pre-reunion tour Love/Johnston lineup, without Brian, Jardine, or Marks, all of whom expressed surprise. Although such dates were noted in a late June issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, it was widely reported that the three had been &quot;fired&quot;. Love later wrote that the end of the reunion came partly as a result of &#x27;interference&#x27; from Brian&#x27;s wife and manager Melinda Ledbetter-Wilson and that he (Love) &quot;had wanted to send out a joint press release, between Brian and me, formally announcing the end of the reunion tour on September 28. But I couldn&#x27;t get Brian&#x27;s management team on board...&quot;

On October 5, Love responded in a self-written press release to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; stating he &quot;did not fire Brian Wilson from the Beach Boys. I cannot fire Brian Wilson from the Beach Boys ... I do not have such authority. And even if I did, I would never fire Brian Wilson from the Beach Boys.&quot; He claimed that nobody in the band &quot;wanted to do a 50th anniversary tour that lasted 10 years&quot; and that its limited run &quot;was long agreed upon&quot;. On October 9, Wilson and Jardine submitted a written response to the rumors stating: &quot;I was completely blindsided by his press release ... We hadn&#x27;t even discussed as a band what we were going to do with all the offers that were coming in for more 50th shows.&quot;

From late September, Love and Johnston continued to perform under the Beach Boys name, while Wilson, Jardine, and Marks toured as a trio in 2013, and a subsequent tour with guitarist Jeff Beck also included Blondie Chaplin at select dates. Wilson and Jardine continued to tour together in 2014 and following years, often joined by Chaplin; Marks declined to join them after 2013.

====Copyright extension releases and occasional partial reunions====
Responding to a new European Union copyright law that extended copyright to 70 years for recordings that were published within 50 years after they were made, Capitol began issuing annual 50-year anniversary &quot;copyright extension&quot; releases of Beach Boys recordings, starting with &quot;The Big Beat 1963&quot; (2013).

In June 2013, Wilson&#x27;s website announced that he was recording and self-producing new material with Jardine, Marks, Chaplin, Don Was, and Jeff Beck. It stated that the material might be split into three albums: one of new pop songs, another of mostly instrumental tracks with Beck, and another of interwoven tracks dubbed &quot;the suite&quot; which initially began form as the closing four tracks of &quot;That&#x27;s Why God Made the Radio&quot;. In January 2014, Wilson declared in an interview that the Beck collaborations would not be released. Released in April 2015, &quot;No Pier Pressure&quot; marked another collaboration between Wilson and Joe Thomas, featuring guest appearances from Jardine, Marks, Chaplin, and others.

Jardine, Marks, Johnston and Love appeared together at the 2014 Ella Awards Ceremony, where Love was honored for his work as a singer. In 2015, &quot;Soundstage&quot; aired an episode featuring Wilson performing with Jardine, Chaplin, and Ricky Fataar at The Venetian in Las Vegas. In April, when asked if he was interested in making music with Love again, Wilson replied: &quot;I don&#x27;t think so, no&quot;, adding in July that he &quot;doesn&#x27;t talk to the Beach Boys [or] Mike Love&quot;.

In 2016, Wilson and Jardine embarked on the Pet Sounds 50th Anniversary World Tour, promoted as Wilson&#x27;s final performances of the album, with Chaplin appearing as a special guest at all dates on select songs. That same year, Love and Wilson each published memoirs, &quot;Good Vibrations: My Life as a Beach Boy&quot; and &quot;I Am Brian Wilson&quot;, respectively. Asked about negative comments that Wilson made about him in the book, Love challenged the legitimacy of statements attributed to Wilson in the book and in the press. In an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; conducted in June 2016, Wilson said he would like to try to repair his relationship with Love and collaborate with him again. In January 2017, Love said: &quot;If it were possible to make it just Brian and I, and have it under control and done better than what happened in 2012, then yeah, I&#x27;d be open to something.&quot;

In July 2018, Wilson, Jardine, Love, Johnston, and Marks reunited for a one-off Q&amp;A session moderated by director Rob Reiner at the Capitol Records Tower in Los Angeles. It was the first time the band had appeared together in public since their 2012 tour. That December, Love described his new holiday album, &quot;Reason for the Season&quot;, as a &quot;message to Brian&quot; and said that he &quot;would love nothing more than to get together with Brian and do some music&quot;.

In 2019, Wilson and Jardine (with Chaplin) embarked on a co-headlining tour with the Zombies, performing selections from &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot;.

In February 2020, Wilson and Jardine&#x27;s official social media pages encouraged fans to boycott the band&#x27;s music after it was announced that Love&#x27;s Beach Boys would perform at the Safari Club International Convention in Reno, Nevada on animal rights grounds. The concert proceeded despite online protests, as Love issued a statement that said his group has always supported &quot;freedom of thought and expression as a fundamental tenet of our rights as Americans&quot;. In October, Love and Johnston&#x27;s Beach Boys performed at a fundraiser for Donald Trump&#x27;s presidential re-election campaign; Wilson and Jardine again issued a statement that they had not been informed about this performance and did not support it.

====Selling of the band&#x27;s intellectual property and 60th anniversary====
In March 2020, Jardine was asked about a possible reunion and responded that the band would reunite for a string of live performances in 2021, although he believed a new album was unlikely. In response to reunion rumors, Love said in May that he was open to a 60th anniversary tour, although Wilson has &quot;some serious health issues&quot;, while Wilson&#x27;s manager Jean Sievers commented that no one had spoken to Wilson about such a tour. In February 2021, it was announced that Brian Wilson, Love, Jardine, and the estate of Carl Wilson had sold a majority stake in the band&#x27;s intellectual property to Irving Azoff and his new company Iconic Artists Group; rumors of a 60th anniversary reunion were again discussed.

In April 2021, Omnivore Recordings released &quot;California Music Presents Add Some Music&quot;, an album featuring Love, Jardine, Marks, Johnston, and several children of the original Beach Boys (most notably on a re-recording of The Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Add Some Music to Your Day&quot; from 1970&#x27;s &quot;Sunflower&quot;). In August, Capitol released the box set &quot;Feel Flows: The Sunflower &amp; Surf&#x27;s Up Sessions 1969–1971&quot;. In 2022, the group was expected to participate in a &quot;60th anniversary celebration&quot;. Azoff stated in an interview from May 2021: &quot;We&#x27;re going to announce a major deal with a streamer for the definitive documentary on The Beach Boys and a 60th anniversary celebration. We&#x27;re planning a tribute concert affiliated with the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame and SiriusXM, with amazing acts. That&#x27;s adding value, and that&#x27;s why I invested in The Beach Boys.&quot;

On Mike Love&#x27;s 81st birthday, Jardine once again hinted at a possible reunion on his Facebook page by stating that he was &quot;looking forward&quot; to seeing Love at the &quot;reunion&quot;. However, while a reunion ultimately did not occur in 2022, Capitol released the &quot;Sail On Sailor – 1972&quot; box set in December; following on from the &quot;Feel Flows&quot; box set, which focused on &quot;Sunflower&quot; and &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot;, &quot;Sail On Sailor&quot; focused on &quot;Carl and the Passions&quot; and &quot;Holland&quot;.

In January 2023, the tribute concert mentioned by Azoff in 2021 was announced as being part of the &quot;Grammys Salute&quot; series of televised tribute concerts. On February 8—three days after the 2023 Grammy award ceremonies, &quot;A Grammy Salute to the Beach Boys&quot; was recorded at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, California and subsequently aired as a two-hour special on CBS on April 9. Present for the taping were Wilson, Jardine, Marks, Johnston, and Love—this time not as performers but as featured guests, seated in a luxury box at the theatre, overlooking tribute performances covering the gamut of their catalog by mostly contemporary artists. According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, the program had 5.18 million viewers.

In July 2023, the Beach Boys announced a limited edition to their book, &quot;The Beach Boys by The Beach Boys&quot;, set to be released in 2024. It will feature exclusive interviews, archived photos, live shots, as well as archived texts from late members Carl and Dennis Wilson.

In March 2024, the band announced the release of a self-titled documentary which would be released by streaming service Disney+, which includes new and archived interviews from various members of the band and their inner circle, including Brian Wilson, Love, Jardine, Marks, Johnston, Carl Wilson, Dennis Wilson, Chaplin, Fataar, Brian Wilson&#x27;s ex-wife Marilyn, and Don Was, among others. The documentary was directed by Frank Marshall and Thom Zimny and was released on May 24, 2024. The documentary included some footage from a private reunion of Brian Wilson, Love, Jardine, Marks, and Johnston at Paradise Cove, where the &quot;Surfin&#x27; Safari&quot; album cover photo was taken in 1962. Brian Wilson, Love, Jardine, Marks, Johnston, and Blondie Chaplin also participated in a non-performing reunion at the documentary&#x27;s premiere on May 24, 2024.

By their 2024 tour, the Beach Boys had played nearly 7,300 concerts. 

==Musical style and development==

In &quot;Understanding Rock: Essays in Musical Analysis&quot;, musicologist Daniel Harrison writes:
The Beach Boys began as a garage band playing 1950s style rock and roll, reassembling styles of music such as surf to include vocal jazz harmony, which created their unique sound. In addition, they introduced their signature approach to common genres such as the pop ballad by applying harmonic or formal twists not native to rock and roll. Among the distinct elements of the Beach Boys&#x27; style were the nasal quality of their singing voices, their use of a falsetto harmony over a driving, locomotive-like melody, and the sudden chiming in of the whole group on a key line. Brian Wilson handled most stages of the group&#x27;s recording process from the beginning, even though he was not properly credited on most of the early recordings.
Early on, Mike Love sang lead vocals in the rock-oriented songs, while Carl contributed guitar lines on the group&#x27;s ballads. Jim Miller commented: &quot;On straight rockers they sang tight harmonies behind Love&#x27;s lead ... on ballads, Brian played his falsetto off against lush, jazz-tinged voicings, often using (for rock) unorthodox harmonic structures.&quot; Harrison adds that &quot;even the least distinguished of the Beach Boys&#x27; early uptempo rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll songs show traces of structural complexity at some level; Brian was simply too curious and experimental to leave convention alone&quot;. Although Brian was often dubbed a perfectionist, he was an inexperienced musician, and his understanding of music was mostly self-taught. At the lyric stage, he usually worked with Love, whose assertive persona provided youthful swagger that contrasted Brian&#x27;s explorations in romanticism and sensitivity. Luis Sanchez noted a pattern where Brian would spare surfing imagery when working with collaborators outside of his band&#x27;s circle, in the examples &quot;Lonely Sea&quot; and &quot;In My Room&quot;.

Brian&#x27;s bandmates resented the notion that he was the sole creative force in the group. In a 1966 article that asked if &quot;the Beach Boys rely too much on sound genius Brian&quot;, Carl said that although Brian was the most responsible for their music, every member of the group contributed ideas. Mike Love wrote: &quot;As far as I was concerned, Brian &quot;was&quot; a genius, deserving of that recognition. But the rest of us were seen as nameless components in Brian&#x27;s music machine ... It didn&#x27;t feel to us as if we were just riding on Brian&#x27;s coattails.&quot; Conversely, Dennis defended Brian&#x27;s stature in the band, stating: &quot;Brian Wilson &quot;is&quot; the Beach Boys. He is the band. We&#x27;re his fucking messengers. He is all of it. Period. We&#x27;re nothing. He&#x27;s everything.&quot;

===Influences===

The band&#x27;s earliest influences came primarily from the work of Chuck Berry and the Four Freshmen. Performed by the Four Freshmen, &quot;Their Hearts Were Full of Spring&quot; (1961) was a particular favorite of the group. By analyzing their arrangements of pop standards, Brian educated himself on jazz harmony. Bearing this in mind, Philip Lambert noted: &quot;If Bob Flanigan helped teach Brian how to sing, then Gershwin, Kern, Porter, and the other members of this pantheon helped him learn how to craft a song.&quot; Other general influences on the group included the Hi-Los, the Penguins, the Robins, Bill Haley &amp; His Comets, Otis Williams, the Cadets, the Everly Brothers, the Shirelles, the Regents, and the Crystals.
The eclectic mix of white and black vocal group influences – ranging from the rock and roll of Berry, the jazz harmonies of the Four Freshmen, the pop of the Four Preps, the folk of the Kingston Trio, the R&amp;B of groups like the Coasters and the Five Satins, and the doo wop of Dion and the Belmonts – helped contribute to the Beach Boys&#x27; uniqueness in American popular music. Carl remembered that Love was &quot;really immersed in doo-wop&quot; and likely &quot;influenced Brian to listen to it&quot;, adding that the &quot;black artists were so much better in terms of rock records in those days that the white records almost sounded like put-ons&quot;.

Another significant influence on Brian&#x27;s work was Burt Bacharach. He said in the 1960s: &quot;Burt Bacharach and Hal David are more like me. They&#x27;re also the best pop team – per se – today. As a producer, Bacharach has a very fresh, new approach.&quot; Regarding surf rock pioneer Dick Dale, Brian said that his influence on the group was limited to Carl and his style of guitar playing. Carl credited Chuck Berry, the Ventures, and John Walker with shaping his guitar style, and that the Beach Boys had learned to play all of the Ventures&#x27; songs by ear early in their career.

In 1967, Lou Reed wrote in &quot;Aspen&quot; that the Beach Boys created a &quot;hybrid sound&quot; out of old rock and the Four Freshmen, explaining that such songs as &quot;Let Him Run Wild&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry Baby&quot;, &quot;I Get Around&quot;, and &quot;Fun, Fun, Fun&quot; were not unlike &quot;Peppermint Stick&quot; by the Elchords. Similarly, John Sebastian of the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful noted: &quot;Brian had control of this vocal palette of which we had no idea. We had never paid attention to the Four Freshmen or doo-wop combos like the Crew Cuts. Look what gold he mined out of that.&quot;

===Vocals===
Brian identified each member individually for their vocal range, once detailing the ranges for Carl, Dennis, Jardine (&quot;[they] progress upwards through G, A, and B&quot;), Love (&quot;can go from bass to the E above middle C&quot;), and himself (&quot;I can take the second D in the treble clef&quot;). He declared in 1966 that his greatest interest was to expand modern vocal harmony, owing to his fascination with a voice to the Four Freshmen, which he considered a &quot;groovy sectional sound&quot;. He added: &quot;The harmonies that we are able to produce give us a uniqueness which is really the only important thing you can put into records – some quality that no one else has got. I love peaks in a song – and enhancing them on the control panel. Most of all, I love the human voice for its own sake.&quot; For a period, Brian avoided singing falsetto for the group, saying: &quot;I thought people thought I was a fairy ... the band told me, &#x27;If that&#x27;s the way you sing, don&#x27;t worry about it.&#x27;&quot;

In the group&#x27;s early recordings, from lowest intervals to highest, the group&#x27;s vocal harmony stack usually began with Love or Dennis, followed by Jardine or Carl, and finally Brian on top, according to Jardine, while Carl said that the blend was Love on bottom, Carl above, followed by Dennis or Jardine, and then Brian on top. Jardine explains: &quot;We always sang the same vocal intervals. ... As soon as we heard the chords on the piano we&#x27;d figure it out pretty easily. If there was a vocal move [Brian] envisioned, he&#x27;d show that particular singer that move. We had somewhat photographic memory as far as the vocal parts were concerned so that [was] never a problem for us.&quot; Striving for perfection, Brian insured that his intricate vocal arrangements exercised the group&#x27;s calculated blend of intonation, attack, phrasing, and expression. Sometimes, he would sing each vocal harmony part alone through multi-track tape.
On the group&#x27;s blend, Carl said: &quot;[Love] has a beautifully rich, very full-sounding bass voice. Yet his lead singing is real nasal, real punk. [Jardine]&#x27;s voice has a bright timbre to it; it really cuts. My voice has a kind of calm sound. We&#x27;re big oooh-ers; we love to oooh. It&#x27;s a big, full sound, that&#x27;s very pleasing to us; it opens up the heart.&quot; Rock critic Erik Davis wrote: &quot;The &#x27;purity&#x27; of tone and genetic proximity that smoothed their voices was almost creepy, pseudo-castrato, [and] a &#x27;barbershop&#x27; sound.&quot; Jimmy Webb said: &quot;They used very little vibrato and sing in very straight tones. The voices all lie down beside each other very easily – there&#x27;s no bumping between them because the pitch is very precise.&quot; According to Brian, &quot;Jack Good once told us, &#x27;You sing like eunuchs in a Sistine Chapel&#x27;, which was a pretty good quote.&quot; Writer Richard Goldstein reported that, according to a fellow journalist who asked Brian about the black roots of his music, Brian&#x27;s response was: &quot;We&#x27;re white and we sing white.&quot; Goldstein added that when he asked where his approach to vocal harmonies had derived from, Wilson answered: &#x27;Barbershop&#x27;.&quot;

===Use of studio musicians===

Biographer James Murphy said: &quot;By most contemporary accounts, they were not a very good live band when they started. ... The Beach Boys learned to play as a band in front of live audiences&quot;, eventually to become &quot;one of the best and enduring live bands&quot;. With only a few exceptions, the Beach Boys played every instrument heard on their first four albums and first five singles. It is the belief of Richie Unterberger that &quot;Before session musicians took over most of the parts, the Beach Boys could play respectably gutsy surf rock as a self-contained unit.&quot;

As Wilson&#x27;s arrangements increased in complexity, he began employing a group of professional studio musicians, later known as &quot;the Wrecking Crew&quot;, to assist with recording the instrumentation on select tracks. According to some reports, these musicians then completely replaced the Beach Boys on the backing tracks to their records. Much of the relevant documentation, while accounting for the attendance of unionized session players, had failed to record the presence of the Beach Boys themselves. These documents, along with the full unedited studio session tapes, were not available for public scrutiny until the 1990s.

Wilson started occasionally employing members of the Wrecking Crew for certain Beach Boys tracks during the 1963 &quot;Surfer Girl&quot; sessions – specifically, on two songs, &quot;Hawaii&quot; and &quot;Our Car Club&quot;. The 1964 albums &quot;Shut Down Volume 2&quot; and &quot;All Summer Long&quot; featured the Beach Boys themselves playing the vast majority of the instruments while occasionally being augmented by outside musicians. It is commonly misreported that Dennis in particular was replaced by Hal Blaine on drums. Dennis&#x27;s drumming is documented on a number of the group&#x27;s singles, including 1964&#x27;s &quot;I Get Around&quot;, &quot;Fun, Fun, Fun&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry Baby&quot;. Starting with the 1965 albums &quot;Today!&quot; and &quot;Summer Days&quot;, Brian used the Wrecking Crew with greater frequency, &quot;but still&quot;, Stebbins writes, &quot;the Beach Boys continued to play the instruments on many of the key tracks and single releases&quot;.

Overall, the Beach Boys played the instruments on the majority of their recordings from the decade, with 1966 and 1967 being the only years when Wilson used the Wrecking Crew almost exclusively. &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; and &quot;Smile&quot; are their only albums in which the backing tracks were largely played by studio musicians. After 1967, the band&#x27;s use of studio musicians was considerably reduced. Wrecking Crew biographer Kent Hartman supported in his 2012 book about the musicians: &quot;Though [Brian Wilson] had for several months brought in various session players on a sporadic, potluck basis to supplement things, the other Beach Boys generally played on the earliest songs, too.&quot;

The source of the longstanding controversy regarding the Beach Boys&#x27; use of studio musicians largely derives from a misinterpreted statement in David Leaf&#x27;s 1978 biography &quot;The Beach Boys and the California Myth&quot;, later bolstered by erroneous recollections from participants of the recording sessions. Starting in the 1990s, unedited studio session tapes, along with American Federation of Musicians (AFM) sheets and tape logs, were leaked to the public. Music historian Craig Slowinski, who contributes musician credits to the liner notes of the band&#x27;s reissues and compilations, wrote in 2006: &quot;[O]nce the vaults were opened up and the tapes were studied, the true situation became clear: the Boys themselves played &quot;most&quot; of the instruments on their records until the &quot;Beach Boys Today!&quot; album in early 1965.&quot; Slowinski goes on to note: &quot;when painting a picture of a Beach Boys recording session, it&#x27;s important to examine &quot;both&quot; the AFM contracts and the session tapes, either of which may be incomplete on their own&quot;.

During the period when Brian relied heavily on studio musicians, Carl was an exception among the Beach Boys in that he played alongside the studio musicians whenever he was available to attend sessions. In Slowinski&#x27;s view, &quot;One should not sell short Carl&#x27;s own contributions; the youngest Wilson had developed as a musician sufficiently to play alongside the horde of high-dollar session pros that big brother was now bringing into the studio. Carl&#x27;s guitar playing [was] a key ingredient.&quot;

===Spirituality===
The band members often reflected on the spiritual nature of their music (and music in general), particularly for the recording of &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; and &quot;Smile&quot;. Even though the Wilsons did not grow up in a particularly religious household, Carl was described as &quot;the most truly religious person I know&quot; by Brian, and Carl was forthcoming about the group&#x27;s spiritual beliefs stating: &quot;We believe in God as a kind of universal consciousness. God is love. God is you. God is me. God is everything right here in this room. It&#x27;s a spiritual concept which inspires a great deal of our music.&quot; Carl told &quot;Rave&quot; magazine in 1967 that the group&#x27;s influences are of a &quot;religious nature&quot;, but not any religion in specific, only &quot;an idea based upon that of Universal Consciousness. ... The spiritual concept of happiness and doing good to others is extremely important to the lyric of our songs, and the religious element of some of the better church music is also contained within some of our new work.&quot;

Brian is quoted during the &quot;Smile&quot; era: &quot;I&#x27;m very religious. Not in the sense of churches, going to church; but like the essence of &quot;all&quot; religion.&quot; During the recording of &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, Brian held prayer meetings, later reflecting that &quot;God was with us the whole time we were doing this record ... I could feel that feeling in my brain.&quot; In 1966, he explained that he wanted to move into a white spiritual sound, and predicted that the rest of the music industry would follow suit. In 2011, Brian maintained the spirituality was important to his music, and that he did not follow any particular religion.

Carl said that &quot;Smile&quot; was chosen as an album title because of its connection to the group&#x27;s spiritual beliefs. Brian referred to &quot;Smile&quot; as his &quot;teenage symphony to God&quot;, composing a hymn, &quot;Our Prayer&quot;, as the album&#x27;s opening spiritual invocation. Experimentation with psychotropic substances also proved pivotal to the group&#x27;s development as artists. He spoke of his LSD trips as a &quot;religious experience&quot;, and during a session for &quot;Our Prayer&quot;, Brian can be heard asking the other Beach Boys: &quot;Do you guys feel any acid yet?&quot;. In 1968, the group&#x27;s interest in transcendental meditation led them to record the original song, &quot;Transcendental Meditation&quot;.

===Achievements===
The Beach Boys are one of the most critically acclaimed, commercially successful, and influential bands of all time. They have sold over 100 million records worldwide. The group&#x27;s early songs made them major pop stars in the US, the UK, Australia and other countries, having seven top 10 singles between April 1963 and November 1964. They were one of the first American groups to exhibit the definitive traits of a self-contained rock band, playing their own instruments and writing their own songs, and they were one of the few American bands formed prior to the 1964 British Invasion to continue their success. Among artists of the 1960s, they are one of the central figures in the histories of rock. Between the 1960s and 2020s, they had 37 songs reach the US Top 40 (the most by an American group) with four topping the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100; they also hold Nielsen SoundScan&#x27;s record as the top-selling American band for albums and singles.

Brian Wilson&#x27;s artistic control over the Beach Boys&#x27; records was unprecedented for the time. Carl Wilson elaborated: &quot;Record companies were used to having absolute control over their artists. It was especially nervy, because Brian was a 21-year-old kid with just two albums. It was unheard of. But what could they say? Brian made good records.&quot; This made the Beach Boys one of the first rock groups to exert studio control. Music producers after the mid-1960s would draw on Brian&#x27;s influence, setting a precedent that allowed bands and artists to enter a recording studio and act as producers, either autonomously, or in conjunction with other like minds.
In 1988, the original five members (the Wilson brothers, Love, and Jardine) were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Ten years later, they were selected for the Vocal Group Hall of Fame. In 2004, &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; was preserved in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. Their recordings of &quot;In My Room&quot;, &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;, &quot;California Girls&quot; and the entire &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; album have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

The Beach Boys are one of the most influential acts of the rock era. In 2017, a study of AllMusic&#x27;s catalog indicated the Beach Boys as the 6th most frequently cited artist influence in its database. In 2021, the staff of &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; ranked the Beach Boys as the top American band of all time; the publication&#x27;s editor wrote in the group&#x27;s entry that &quot;few bands ... have had a greater impact on popular music&quot;.

===California sound===
Professor of cultural studies James M. Curtis wrote in 1987: &quot;We can say that the Beach Boys represent the outlook and values of white Protestant Anglo-Saxon teenagers in the early sixties. Having said that, we immediately realize that they must mean much more than this. Their stability, their staying power, and their ability to attract new fans prove as much.&quot; Cultural historian Kevin Starr explains that the group first connected with young Americans specifically for their lyrical interpretation of a mythologized landscape: &quot;Cars and the beach, surfing, the California Girl, all this fused in the alembic of youth: Here was a way of life, an iconography, already half-released into the chords and multiple tracks of a new sound.&quot; In music critic Robert Christgau&#x27;s opinion, &quot;the Beach Boys were a touchstone for real rock and rollers, all of whom understood that the music had its most essential roots in an innocently hedonistic materialism&quot;.

The group&#x27;s &quot;California sound&quot; grew to national prominence through the success of their 1963 album &quot;Surfin&#x27; U.S.A.&quot;, which helped turn the surfing subculture into a mainstream youth-targeted advertising image widely exploited by the film, television, and food industry. The group&#x27;s surf music was not entirely of their own invention, being preceded by artists such as Dick Dale. However, previous surf musicians did not project a world view as the Beach Boys did. The band&#x27;s earlier surf music helped raise the profile of the state of California, creating its first major regional style with national significance, and establishing a musical identity for Southern California, as opposed to Hollywood. California ultimately supplanted New York as the center of popular music thanks to the success of Brian&#x27;s productions.
A 1966 article discussing new trends in rock music writes that the Beach Boys popularized a type of drum beat heard in Jan and Dean&#x27;s &quot;Surf City&quot;, which sounds like &quot;a locomotive getting up speed&quot;, in addition to the method of &quot;suddenly stopping in between the chorus and verse&quot;. Pete Townshend of the Who is credited with coining the term &quot;power pop&quot;, which he defined as &quot;what we play—what the Small Faces used to play, and the kind of pop the Beach Boys played in the days of &#x27;Fun, Fun, Fun&#x27; which I preferred&quot;.

The California sound gradually evolved to reflect a more musically ambitious and mature worldview, becoming less to do with surfing and cars and more about social consciousness and political awareness. Between 1964 and 1969, it fueled innovation and transition, inspiring artists to tackle largely unmentioned themes such as sexual freedom, black pride, drugs, oppositional politics, other countercultural motifs, and war. Soft pop (later known as &quot;sunshine pop&quot;) derived in part from this movement. Sunshine pop producers widely imitated the orchestral style of &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;; however, the Beach Boys themselves were rarely representative of the genre, which was rooted in easy-listening and advertising jingles.

By the end of the 1960s, the California sound declined due to a combination of the West Coast&#x27;s cultural shifts, Wilson&#x27;s professional and psychological downturn, and the Manson murders, with David Howard calling it the &quot;sunset of the original California Sunshine Sound ... [the] sweetness advocated by the California Myth had led to chilling darkness and unsightly rot&quot;. Drawing from the Beach Boys&#x27; associations with Manson and former California governor Ronald Reagan, Erik Davis remarked: &quot;The Beach Boys may be the only bridge between those deranged poles. There is a wider range of political and aesthetic sentiments in their records than in any other band in those heady times—like the state [of California], they expand and bloat and contradict themselves.&quot;

During the 1970s, advertising jingles and imagery were predominately based on the Beach Boys&#x27; early music and image. The group also inspired the development of the West Coast style later dubbed &quot;yacht rock&quot;. According to &quot;Jacobin&quot;″s Dan O&#x27;Sullivan, the band&#x27;s aesthetic was the first to be &quot;scavenged&quot; by yacht rock acts like Rupert Holmes. O&#x27;Sullivan also cites the Beach Boys&#x27; recording of &quot;Sloop John B&quot; as the origin of yacht rock&#x27;s preoccupation with the &quot;sailors and beachgoers&quot; aesthetic that was &quot;lifted by everyone, from Christopher Cross to Eric Carmen, from &#x27;Buffalo Springfield&#x27; folksters like Jim Messina to &#x27;Philly Sound&#x27; rockers like Hall &amp; Oates&quot;.

===Innovations===

&quot;Pet Sounds&quot; came to inform the developments of genres such as pop, rock, jazz, electronic, experimental, punk, and hip hop. Similar to subsequent experimental rock LPs by Frank Zappa, the Beatles, and the Who, &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; featured countertextural aspects that called attention to the very recordedness of the album. Professor of American history John Robert Greene stated that the album broke new ground and took rock music away from its casual lyrics and melodic structures into what was then uncharted territory. He furthermore called it one factor which spawned the majority of trends in post-1965 rock music, the only others being &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Revolver&quot;, and the contemporary folk movement. The album was the first piece in popular music to incorporate the Electro-Theremin, an easier-to-play version of the theremin, as well as the first in rock music to feature a theremin-like instrument. With &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, they were also the first group to make an entire album that departed from the usual small-ensemble electric rock band format.

According to David Leaf in 1978, &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; and &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; &quot;established the group as the leaders of a new type of pop music, Art Rock&quot;. Academic Bill Martin states that the band opened a path in rock music &quot;that went from &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s&quot; to &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; and beyond&quot;. He argues that the advancing technology of multitrack recording and mixing boards were more influential to experimental rock than electronic instruments such as the synthesizer, allowing the Beatles and the Beach Boys to become the first crop of non-classically trained musicians to create extended and complex compositions. In &quot;Strange Sounds: Offbeat Instruments and Sonic Experiments in Pop&quot;, Mark Brend writes:
The making of &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;, according to Domenic Priore, was &quot;unlike anything previous in the realms of classical, jazz, international, soundtrack, or any other kind of recording&quot;, while biographer Peter Ames Carlin wrote that it &quot;sounded like nothing that had ever been played on the radio before&quot;. It contained previously untried mixes of instruments, and was the first successful pop song to have cellos in a juddering rhythm. Musicologist Charlie Gillett called it &quot;one of the first records to flaunt studio production as a quality in its own right, rather than as a means of presenting a performance&quot;. Again, Brian employed the use of Electro-Theremin for the track. Upon release, the single prompted an unexpected revival in theremins while increasing awareness of analog synthesizers, leading Moog Music to produce their own brand of ribbon-controlled instruments. In a 1968 editorial for &quot;Jazz &amp; Pop&quot;, Gene Sculatti predicted that the song &quot;may yet prove to be the most significantly revolutionary piece of the current rock renaissance ... In no minor way, &#x27;Good Vibrations&#x27; is a primary influential piece for all producing rock artists; everyone has felt its import to some degree&quot;.

Discussing &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;, Daniel Harrison argues that the album could &quot;almost&quot; be considered art music in the Western classical tradition, and that the group&#x27;s innovations in the musical language of rock can be compared to those that introduced atonal and other nontraditional techniques into that classical tradition. He explains: &quot;The spirit of experimentation is just as palpable ... as it is in, say, Schoenberg&#x27;s op. 11 piano pieces.&quot; However, such notions were not widely acknowledged by rock audiences nor by the classically minded at the time. Harrison concludes: &quot;What influences could these innovations then have? The short answer is, not much. &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;, &quot;Wild Honey&quot;, &quot;Friends&quot;, and &quot;20/20&quot; sound like few other rock albums; they are &quot;sui generis&quot;. ... It must be remembered that the commercial failure of the Beach Boys&#x27; experiments was hardly motivation for imitation.&quot; Musicologist David Toop, who included the &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; track &quot;Fall Breaks and Back to Winter&quot; on a companion CD for his book &quot;Ocean of Sound&quot;, placed the Beach Boys&#x27; effect on sound pioneering in league with Les Baxter, Aphex Twin, Herbie Hancock, King Tubby, and My Bloody Valentine.

&quot;Sunflower&quot; marked an end to the experimental songwriting and production phase initiated by &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;. After &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot;, Harrison wrote, their albums &quot;contain a mixture of middle-of-the-road music entirely consonant with pop style during the early 1970s with a few oddities that proved that the desire to push beyond conventional boundaries was not dead&quot;, until 1974, &quot;the year in which the Beach Boys ceased to be a rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll act and became an oldies act&quot;.

===Punk, alternative, and indie===

In the 1970s, the Beach Boys served a &quot;totemic influence&quot; on punk rock that later gave way to indie rock. Brad Shoup of Stereogum surmised that, thanks to the Ramones&#x27; praise for the group, many punk, pop punk, or &quot;punk-adjacent&quot; artists showed influence from the Beach Boys, noting cover versions of the band&#x27;s songs recorded by Slickee Boys, Agent Orange, Bad Religion, Shonen Knife, the Queers, Hi-Standard, the Descendents, the Donnas, M.O.D., and the Vandals. &quot;The Beach Boys Love You&quot; is sometimes considered the group&#x27;s &quot;punk album&quot;, and &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; is sometimes advanced as the first emo album.

In the 1990s, the Beach Boys experienced a resurgence of popularity with the alternative rock generation. According to Sean O&#x27;Hagan, leader of the High Llamas and former member of Stereolab, a younger generation of record-buyers &quot;stopped listening to indie records&quot; in favor of the Beach Boys. Bands who advocated for the Beach Boys included founding members of the Elephant 6 Collective (Neutral Milk Hotel, the Olivia Tremor Control, the Apples in Stereo, and of Montreal). United by a shared love of the group&#x27;s music, they named Pet Sounds Studio in honor of the band. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer Barry Walters wrote in 2000 that albums such as &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; and &quot;Love You&quot; &quot;are becoming sonic blueprints, akin to what early Velvet Underground LPs meant to the previous indie peer group&quot;. The High Llamas, Eric Matthews and Saint Etienne are among the &quot;alt heroes&quot; who contributed cover versions of &quot;unreleased, overlooked or underappreciated Wilson/Beach Boys obscurities&quot; on the tribute album &quot;Caroline Now!&quot; (2000).

The Beach Boys remained among the most significant influences on indie rock into the late 2000s. &quot;Smile&quot; became a touchstone for many bands who were labelled &quot;chamber pop&quot;, a term used for artists influenced by the lush orchestrations of Brian Wilson, Lee Hazlewood, and Burt Bacharach. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; writer Mark Richardson cited &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; as the origin point of &quot;the kind of lo-fi bedroom pop that would later propel Sebadoh, Animal Collective, and other characters&quot;. The &quot;Sunflower&quot; track &quot;All I Wanna Do&quot; is also cited as one of the earliest precursors to chillwave, a microgenre that emerged in 2009.

==Landmarks==

* The Wilsons&#x27; California house, where the Wilson brothers grew up and the group began, was demolished in 1986 to make way for Interstate 105, the Century Freeway. A Beach Boys Historic Landmark (California Landmark No. 1041 at 3701 West 119th Street), dedicated on May 20, 2005, marks the location.
* On December 30, 1980, the Beach Boys were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, located at 1500 Vine Street.
* On September 2, 1977, the Beach Boys performed before an audience of 40,000 at Narragansett Park in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, which remains the largest concert audience in Rhode Island history. On August 9, 2017, a commemoration ceremony produced by Al Gomes and Connie Watrous of Big Noise took place in Rhode Island with the Beach Boys, and the street where the concert stage formerly stood (at 510 Narragansett Park Drive) was officially renamed to &quot;Beach Boys Way&quot;.
* On September 21, 2017, the Beach Boys were honored by Roger Williams University, along with Al Gomes and Connie Watrous of Big Noise, and plaques were unveiled to commemorate the band&#x27;s concert on September 22, 1971, at the Baypoint Inn &amp; Conference Center in Portsmouth, Rhode Island. The concert was the first-ever appearance of South African Ricky Fataar as an official member of the band and Filipino Billy Hinsche as a touring member, essentially changing the Beach Boys&#x27; live and recording act&#x27;s line-up into a multi-cultural group. Diversity is a credo of Roger Williams University, which is why they chose to celebrate this moment in the band&#x27;s history.

<text>Helen Beatrix Heelis (; 28 July 186622 December 1943), usually known as Beatrix Potter ( ), was an English writer, illustrator, natural scientist, and conservationist. She is best known for her children&#x27;s books featuring animals, such as &quot;The Tale of Peter Rabbit&quot;, which was her first commercially published work in 1902. Her books, including &quot;The Tale of Jemima Puddle Duck&quot; and &quot;The Tale of Tom Kitten&quot;, have sold more than 250 million copies. An entrepreneur, Potter was a pioneer of character merchandising. In 1903, Peter Rabbit was the first fictional character to be made into a patented stuffed toy, making him the oldest licensed character.

Born into an upper-middle-class household, Potter was educated by governesses and grew up isolated from other children. She had numerous pets and spent holidays in the Lake District, developing a love of landscape, flora and fauna, all of which she closely observed and painted. Potter&#x27;s study and watercolours of fungi led to her being widely respected in the field of mycology. In her thirties, Potter self-published the highly successful children&#x27;s book &quot;The Tale of Peter Rabbit&quot;. Following this, Potter began writing and illustrating children&#x27;s books full-time.

Potter wrote over sixty books, with the best known being her twenty-three children&#x27;s tales. In 1905, using the proceeds from her books and a legacy from an aunt, Potter bought Hill Top Farm in Near Sawrey, a village in the Lake District. Over the following decades, she purchased additional farms to preserve the unique hill country landscape. In 1913, at the age of 47, she married William Heelis (1871–1945), a respected local solicitor with an office in Hawkshead. Potter was also a prize-winning breeder of Herdwick sheep and a prosperous farmer keenly interested in land preservation. She continued to write, illustrate, and design merchandise based on her children&#x27;s books for British publisher Warne until the duties of land management and her diminishing eyesight made it difficult to continue.

Potter died of pneumonia and heart disease on 22 December 1943 at her home in Near Sawrey, England at the age of 77, leaving almost all her property to the National Trust. She is credited with preserving much of the land that now constitutes the Lake District National Park. Potter&#x27;s books continue to sell throughout the world in many languages with her stories being retold in songs, films, ballet, and animations, and her life is depicted in two films – &quot;The Tales of Beatrix Potter&quot; (1983) and &quot;Miss Potter&quot; (2006).

==Biography==

===Early life ===
Potter&#x27;s family on both sides were from the Manchester area. They were English Unitarians, associated with dissenting Protestant congregations, influential in 19th-century Britain, that affirmed the oneness of God and that rejected the doctrine of the Trinity. Potter&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Edmund Potter, from Glossop in Derbyshire, owned what was then the largest calico printing works in England, and later served as a Member of Parliament.

Potter&#x27;s father, Rupert William Potter (1832–1914), was educated at Manchester College by the Unitarian philosopher James Martineau. He then trained as a barrister in London. Rupert practiced law, specialising in equity law and conveyancing. He married Helen Leech (1839–1932) on 8 August 1863 at Hyde Unitarian Chapel, Gee Cross. Helen was the daughter of Jane Ashton (1806–1884) and John Leech, a wealthy cotton merchant and shipbuilder from Stalybridge. Helen&#x27;s first cousins were siblings Harriet Lupton (&quot;née&quot; Ashton) and Thomas Ashton, 1st Baron Ashton of Hyde. It was reported in July 2014 that Potter had personally given a number of her own original hand-painted illustrations to the two daughters of Arthur and Harriet Lupton, who were cousins to both Beatrix Potter and Catherine, Princess of Wales.
Potter&#x27;s parents lived comfortably at 2 Bolton Gardens, West Brompton, London, where Helen Beatrix was born on 28 July 1866 and her brother Walter Bertram on 14 March 1872. The house was destroyed in the Blitz. Bousfield Primary School now stands where the house once was. A blue plaque on the school building testifies to the former site of the Potter home. Both parents were artistically talented, and Rupert was an adept amateur photographer. Rupert had invested in the stock market, and by the early 1890s, he was extremely wealthy.

Beatrix Potter was educated by three governesses, the last of whom was Annie Moore (&quot;née&quot; Carter), just three years older than Potter, who tutored Potter in German as well as acting as lady&#x27;s companion. She and Potter remained friends throughout their lives, and Annie&#x27;s eight children were the recipients of many of Potter&#x27;s picture letters. It was Annie who later suggested that these letters might make good children&#x27;s books.
She and her younger brother Walter Bertram (1872–1918) grew up with few friends outside their large extended family. Her parents were artistic, interested in nature, and enjoyed the countryside. As children, Potter and Bertram had numerous small animals as pets which they observed closely and drew endlessly. In their schoolroom, Potter and Bertram kept a variety of small pets—mice, rabbits, a hedgehog and some bats, along with collections of butterflies and other insects—which they drew and studied. Potter was devoted to the care of her small animals, often taking them with her on long holidays. In most of the first fifteen years of her life, Potter spent summer holidays at Dalguise, an estate on the River Tay in Perthshire, Scotland. There she sketched and explored an area that nourished her imagination and her observation. Her first sketchbook from those holidays, kept at age 8 and dated 1875, is held at and has been digitised by the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, London. Potter and her brother were allowed great freedom in the country, and both children became adept students of natural history. In 1882, when Dalguise was no longer available, the Potters took their first summer holiday in the Lake District, at Wray Castle near Lake Windermere. Here Potter met Hardwicke Rawnsley, vicar of Wray and later the founding secretary of the National Trust, whose interest in the countryside and country life inspired the same in Potter and who was to have a lasting impact on her life.
At about the age of 14, Potter began to keep a diary, written in a simple substitution cipher of her own devising. Her &quot;Journal&quot; was important to the development of her creativity, serving as both sketchbook and literary experiment. In tiny handwriting, she reported on society, recorded her impressions of art and artists, recounted stories and observed life around her. The &quot;Journal&quot;, deciphered and transcribed by Leslie Linder in 1958, does not provide an intimate record of her personal life, but it is an invaluable source for understanding a vibrant part of British society in the late 19th century. It describes Potter&#x27;s maturing artistic and intellectual interests, her often amusing insights into the places she visited, and her unusual ability to observe nature and to describe it. Started in 1881, her journal ends in 1897 when her artistic and intellectual energies were absorbed in scientific study and in efforts to publish her drawings. Precocious but reserved and often bored, she was searching for more independent activities and wished to earn some money of her own while dutifully taking care of her parents, dealing with her especially demanding mother, and managing their various households.

===Scientific illustrations and work in mycology===

In the Victorian era, women of her class were privately educated and rarely went to university. Potter&#x27;s parents encouraged her higher education, but the social norms of the time limited her academic career within Britain&#x27;s institutions.

Beatrix Potter was interested in every branch of natural science except astronomy. Botany was a passion for most Victorians, and nature study was a popular enthusiasm. She collected fossils, studied archaeological artefacts from London excavations, and was interested in entomology. In all these areas, she drew and painted her specimens with increasing skill. By the 1890s, her scientific interests centred on mycology. First drawn to fungi because of their colours and evanescence in nature and her delight in painting them, her interest deepened after meeting Charles McIntosh, a revered naturalist and amateur mycologist, during a summer holiday in Dunkeld in Perthshire in 1892. He helped improve the accuracy of her illustrations, taught her taxonomy, and supplied her with live specimens to paint during the winter. &lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

Rebuffed by William Thiselton-Dyer, the Director at Kew, because of her sex and amateur status, Potter wrote up her conclusions and submitted a paper, &quot;On the Germination of the Spores of the Agaricineae&quot;, to the Linnean Society in 1897. It was introduced by Massee because, as a woman, Potter could not attend proceedings nor read her paper. She subsequently withdrew it, realising that some of her samples were contaminated, but continued her microscopic studies for several more years. Her work is only now being properly evaluated. Potter later gave her other mycological and scientific drawings to the Armitt Museum and Library in Ambleside, where mycologists still refer to them to identify fungi. There is also a collection of her fungus paintings at the Perth Museum and Art Gallery in Perth, Scotland, donated by Charles McIntosh. In 1967, the mycologist W. P. K. Findlay included many of Potter&#x27;s beautifully accurate fungus drawings in his &quot;Wayside &amp; Woodland Fungi&quot;, thereby fulfilling her desire to one day have her fungus drawings published in a book. In 1997, the Linnean Society issued a posthumous apology to Potter for the sexism displayed in its handling of her research.

===Artistic and literary career===

Potter&#x27;s artistic and literary interests were deeply influenced by fairy tales and fantasy. She was a student of the classic fairy tales of Western Europe as well as stories from the Old Testament, John Bunyan&#x27;s &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; and Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;. She grew up with &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Fables&quot;, the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen, Charles Kingsley&#x27;s &quot;The Water Babies&quot;, the folk tales and mythology of Scotland, the German Romantics, Shakespeare, and the romances of Sir Walter Scott. As a young child, before the age of eight, Edward Lear&#x27;s &quot;A Book of Nonsense&quot;, including the much-loved &quot;The Owl and the Pussycat&quot;, and Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; had made their impression, although she later said of &quot;Alice&quot; that she was more interested in Tenniel&#x27;s illustrations than what they were about.

The &quot;Brer Rabbit&quot; stories of Joel Chandler Harris had been family favourites, and she later studied his &quot;Uncle Remus&quot; stories and illustrated them. She studied book illustration from a young age and developed her own tastes, but the work of the picture book triumvirate Walter Crane, Kate Greenaway and Randolph Caldecott, the last an illustrator whose work was later collected by her father, was a great influence. Her earliest illustrations focused on traditional rhymes and stories like &quot;Cinderella&quot;, &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, &quot;Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves&quot;, &quot;Puss in Boots&quot;, and &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot;. However, most often her illustrations were fantasies featuring her own pets: mice, rabbits, kittens, and guinea pigs.

In her teenage years, Potter was a regular visitor to the art galleries of London, particularly enjoying the summer and winter exhibitions at the Royal Academy in London. Her &quot;Journal&quot; reveals her growing sophistication as a critic as well as the influence of her father&#x27;s friend, the artist Sir John Everett Millais, who recognised Potter&#x27;s talent of observation. Although Potter was aware of art and artistic trends, her drawing and her prose style were uniquely her own.
As a way to earn money in the 1890s, Potter printed Christmas cards of her own design, as well as cards for special occasions. These were her first commercially successful works as an illustrator. Mice and rabbits were the most frequent subject of her fantasy paintings. In 1890, the firm of Hildesheimer and Faulkner bought several of the drawings of her rabbit Benjamin Bunny to illustrate verses by Frederic Weatherly titled &quot;A Happy Pair&quot;. In 1893, the same printer bought several more drawings for Weatherly&#x27;s &quot;Our Dear Relations&quot;, another book of rhymes, and the following year Potter sold a series of frog illustrations and verses for &quot;Changing Pictures&quot;, a popular annual offered by the art publisher Ernest Nister. Potter was pleased by this success and determined to publish her own illustrated stories.

Whenever Potter went on holiday to the Lake District or Scotland, she sent letters to young friends, illustrating them with quick sketches. Many of these letters were written to the children of her former governess Annie Carter Moore, particularly to Moore&#x27;s eldest son Noel, who was often ill. In September 1893, Potter was on holiday at Eastwood in Dunkeld, Perthshire. She had run out of things to say to Noel, and so she told him a story about &quot;four little rabbits whose names were Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail, and Peter&quot;. It became one of the most famous children&#x27;s letters ever written and the basis of Potter&#x27;s future career as a writer-artist-storyteller.
In 1900, Potter revised her tale about the four little rabbits, and fashioned a dummy book of it – it has been suggested, in imitation of Helen Bannerman&#x27;s 1899 bestseller &quot;The Story of Little Black Sambo&quot;. Unable to find a buyer for the work, she published it for family and friends at her own expense in December 1901. It was drawn in black and white with a coloured frontispiece. Rawnsley had great faith in Potter&#x27;s tale, recast it in didactic verse, and made the rounds of the London publishing houses. Frederick Warne &amp; Co had previously rejected the tale but, eager to compete in the booming small format children&#x27;s book market, reconsidered and accepted the &quot;bunny book&quot; (as the firm called it) following the recommendation of their prominent children&#x27;s book artist L. Leslie Brooke. The firm declined Rawnsley&#x27;s verse in favour of Potter&#x27;s original prose, and Potter agreed to colour her pen and ink illustrations, choosing the new Hentschel three-colour process to reproduce her watercolours.
On 2 October 1902, &quot;The Tale of Peter Rabbit&quot; was published and became an immediate success. It was followed the next year by &quot;The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin&quot; and &quot;The Tailor of Gloucester&quot;, which had also first been written as picture letters to the Moore children. Working with Norman Warne as her editor, Potter published two or three little books each year: 23 books in all. The last book in this format was &quot;Cecily Parsley&#x27;s Nursery Rhymes&quot; in 1922, a collection of favourite rhymes. Although &quot;The Tale of Little Pig Robinson&quot; was not published until 1930, it had been written much earlier. Potter continued creating her little books until after the First World War when her energies were increasingly directed toward her farming, sheep-breeding, and land conservation.

The immense popularity of Potter&#x27;s books was based on the lively quality of her illustrations, the non-didactic nature of her stories, the depiction of the rural countryside, and the imaginative qualities she lent to her animal characters.

Potter was also a canny businesswoman. As early as 1903, she made and patented a Peter Rabbit doll. It was followed by other merchandise over the years, including painting books, board games, wall-paper, figurines, baby blankets and china tea-sets. All were licensed by Frederick Warne &amp; Co and earned Potter an independent income, as well as immense profits for her publisher.

In 1905, Potter and Norman Warne became unofficially engaged. Potter&#x27;s parents objected to the match because Warne was &quot;in trade&quot; and thus not socially suitable. The engagement lasted only one month—Warne died of pernicious anaemia at age 37. That same year, Potter used some of her income and a small inheritance from an aunt to buy Hill Top Farm in Near Sawrey, located west of Lake Windermere in the English Lake District. Potter and Warne may have hoped that Hill Top Farm would be their holiday home, but after Warne&#x27;s death, Potter went ahead with its purchase as she had always wanted to own that farm and live in &quot;that charming village&quot;.

===Country life and marriage===
The tenant farmer John Cannon and his family agreed to stay on to manage the farm for her while she made physical improvements and learned the techniques of fell farming and of raising livestock, including pigs, cows and chickens; the following year she added sheep. Realising she needed to protect her boundaries, she sought advice from W.H. Heelis &amp; Son, a local firm of solicitors with offices in nearby Hawkshead. With William Heelis acting for her, she bought contiguous pasture, and in 1909 the Castle Farm across the road from Hill Top Farm. She visited Hill Top at every opportunity, and her books written during this period (such as &quot;The Tale of Ginger and Pickles&quot;, about the local shop in Near Sawrey and &quot;The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse&quot;, a wood mouse) reflect her increasing participation in village life and her delight in country living.
Owning and managing these working farms required routine collaboration with the widely respected William Heelis. By the summer of 1912, Heelis had proposed marriage and Potter had accepted; although she did not immediately tell her parents, who once again disapproved because Heelis was only a country solicitor. Potter and Heelis were married on 15 October 1913 in London at St Mary Abbots in Kensington. The couple moved immediately to Near Sawrey, residing at Castle Cottage, the renovated farmhouse on Castle Farm, which was large. Hill Top remained a working farm but was now remodelled to allow for the tenant family and Potter&#x27;s private studio and workshop. At last her own woman, Potter settled into the partnerships that shaped the rest of her life: her country solicitor husband and his large family, her farms, the Sawrey community and the predictable rounds of country life. &quot;The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck&quot; and &quot;The Tale of Tom Kitten&quot; are representative of Hill Top Farm and her farming life and reflect her happiness with her country life.

Her father, Rupert Potter, died in 1914, and with the outbreak of World War I, Potter persuaded her mother to move to the Lake District, renting her a property in Sawrey. Finding life in Sawrey dull, Helen Potter soon moved to Lindeth Howe (now a 34-bedroomed hotel), a large house the Potters had previously rented for the summer in Bowness, on the other side of Lake Windermere. Potter continued to write stories for Frederick Warne &amp; Co and fully participated in country life. She established a nursing trust for local villages and served on various committees and councils responsible for footpaths and other rural issues.

===Sheep farming===
Soon after acquiring Hill Top Farm, Potter became keenly interested in the breeding and raising of Herdwick sheep, the indigenous fell sheep. In 1923 she bought a large sheep farm in the Troutbeck Valley called Troutbeck Park Farm, formerly a deer park, restoring its land with thousands of Herdwick sheep. This established her as one of the major Herdwick sheep farmers in the county. She was admired by her shepherds and farm managers for her willingness to experiment with the latest biological remedies for the common diseases of sheep, and for her employment of the best shepherds, sheep breeders, and farm managers.

By the late 1920s, Potter and her Hill Top farm manager Tom Storey had made a name for their prize-winning Herdwick flock, which took many prizes at the local agricultural shows, where Potter was often asked to serve as a judge. In 1942 she became President-elect of the Herdwick Sheepbreeders&#x27; Association, the first time a woman had been elected, but died before taking office.

===Welsh language===
In one of her diary entries whilst travelling through Wales, Potter complained about the Welsh language. She wrote &quot;Machynlleth, wretched town, hardly a person could speak English&quot;, continuing &quot;Welsh seem a pleasant intelligent race, but I should think awkward to live with... the language is past description.&quot;

==Lake District conservation==

Potter had been a disciple of the land conservation and preservation ideals of her long-time friend and mentor, Canon Hardwicke Rawnsley, the first secretary and founding member of the National Trust. According to the National Trust, &quot;she supported the efforts of the National Trust to preserve not just the places of extraordinary beauty but also those heads of valleys and low grazing lands that would be irreparably ruined by development.&quot; Potter was also an authority on the traditional Lakeland crafts and period furniture, as well as local stonework. She restored and preserved the farms that she bought or managed, making sure that each farm house had in it a piece of antique Lakeland furniture. Potter was interested in preserving not only the Herdwick sheep but also the way of life of fell farming. In 1930 the Heelises became partners with the National Trust in buying and managing the fell farms included in the large Monk Coniston Estate.

The estate was composed of many farms spread over a wide area of north-western Lancashire, including the Tarn Hows. Potter was the &quot;de facto&quot; estate manager for the Trust for seven years until the National Trust could afford to repurchase most of the property from her. Potter&#x27;s stewardship of these farms earned her full regard, but she was not without her critics, not the least of which were her contemporaries who felt she used her wealth and the position of her husband to acquire properties in advance of their being made public. She was notable in observing the problems of afforestation, preserving the intact grazing lands, and husbanding the quarries and timber on these farms. All her farms were stocked with Herdwick sheep and frequently with Galloway cattle.

==Later life==

Potter continued to write stories and to draw, although mostly for her own pleasure. In 1922, &quot;Cecily Parsley&#x27;s Nursery Rhymes&quot;, a collection of traditional English nursery rhymes, was published. Her books in the late 1920s included the semi-autobiographical &quot;The Fairy Caravan&quot;, a fanciful tale set in her beloved Troutbeck fells. It was published only in the US during Potter&#x27;s lifetime, and not until 1952 in the UK. &quot;Sister Anne&quot;, Potter&#x27;s version of the story of Bluebeard, was written for her American readers, but illustrated by Katharine Sturges. A final folktale, &quot;Wag by Wall&quot;, was published posthumously by &quot;The Horn Book Magazine&quot; in 1944. Potter was a generous patron of the Girl Guides, whose troops she allowed to make their summer encampments on her land, and whose company she enjoyed as an older woman.

Potter and William Heelis enjoyed a happy marriage of thirty years, continuing their farming and preservation efforts throughout the hard days of World War II. Although they were childless, Potter played an important role in William&#x27;s large family, particularly enjoying her relationship with several nieces whom she helped educate, and giving comfort and aid to her husband&#x27;s brothers and sisters.

Potter died of complications from pneumonia and heart disease on 22 December 1943 at Castle Cottage, and her remains were cremated at Carleton Crematorium, Blackpool. She left nearly all her property to the National Trust, including over of land, sixteen farms, cottages and herds of cattle and Herdwick sheep. Hers was the largest gift at that time to the National Trust, and it enabled the preservation of the land now included in the Lake District National Park and the continuation of fell farming. The central office of the National Trust in Swindon was named &quot;Heelis&quot; in 2005 in her memory. William Heelis continued his stewardship of their properties and of her literary and artistic work for the twenty months he survived her. When he died in August 1945, he left the remainder to the National Trust.

==Legacy==

Potter left almost all the original illustrations for her books to the National Trust. The copyright to her stories and merchandise was then given to her publisher Frederick Warne &amp; Co, now a division of the Penguin Group. On 1 January 2014, the copyright expired in the UK and other countries with a 70-years-after-death limit. Hill Top Farm was opened to the public by the National Trust in 1946; her artwork was displayed there until 1985 when it was moved to William Heelis&#x27;s former law offices in Hawkshead, also owned by the National Trust as the Beatrix Potter Gallery.

Potter gave her folios of mycological drawings to the Armitt Library and Museum in Ambleside before her death. &quot;The Tale of Peter Rabbit&quot; is owned by Warne, &quot;The Tailor of Gloucester&quot; by the Tate Gallery, and &quot;The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies&quot; by the British Museum.

In 1903, Potter created the first Peter Rabbit soft toy and registered him at the Patent Office in London, making Peter the oldest licensed fictional character. Merchandise of Peter and other Potter characters have been sold at Harrods department store in London since at least 1910 when the range first appeared in their catalogues. Along with her writing Potter would continue to oversee merchandising and licensing opportunities for her characters. On her legacy, Nicholas Tucker in &quot;The Guardian&quot; writes, &quot;she was the first author to license fictional characters to a range of toys and household objects still on sale today&quot;. In an article by the &quot;Smithsonian&quot; magazine titled, &quot;How Beatrix Potter Invented Character Merchandising&quot;, Joy Lanzendorfer writes, &quot;Potter was also an entrepreneur and a pioneer in licensing and merchandising literary characters. Potter built a retail empire out of her “bunny book” that is worth $500 million today. In the process, she created a system that continues to benefit all licensed characters, from Mickey Mouse to Harry Potter.&quot;

The largest public collection of her letters and drawings is the Leslie Linder Bequest and Leslie Linder Collection at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. (Linder was the collector who—after five years of work—finally transcribed Potter&#x27;s early journal, originally written in code.) In the United States, the largest public collections are those in the Rare Book Department of the Free Library of Philadelphia, and the Cotsen Children&#x27;s Library at Princeton University.

In 2015, a manuscript for an unpublished book was discovered by Jo Hanks, a publisher at Penguin Random House Children&#x27;s Books, in the Victoria and Albert Museum archive. The book &quot;The Tale of Kitty-in-Boots&quot;, with illustrations by Quentin Blake, was published 1 September 2016, to mark the 150th anniversary of Potter&#x27;s birth. Also in 2016, Peter Rabbit was depicted on the reverse of a British fifty pence coin, and Peter along with other Potter characters featured on a series of UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail.

In 2017, &quot;The Art of Beatrix Potter: Sketches, Paintings, and Illustrations&quot; by Emily Zach was published after San Francisco publisher Chronicle Books decided to mark the 150th anniversary of Beatrix Potter&#x27;s birth by showing that she was &quot;far more than a 19th-century weekend painter. She was an artist of astonishing range.&quot;

In December 2017, the asteroid 13975 Beatrixpotter, discovered by Belgian astronomer Eric Elst in 1992, was renamed in her memory. In 2022, an exhibition, &quot;Beatrix Potter: Drawn to Nature&quot;, was held at the Victoria and Albert Museum. Research for the exhibition identified the man&#x27;s court waistcoat c. 1780s, which inspired Potter&#x27;s sketch in &quot;The Tailor of Gloucester&quot;.

==Analysis==
There are many interpretations of Potter&#x27;s literary work, the sources of her art, and her life and times. These include critical evaluations of her corpus of children&#x27;s literature and Modernist interpretations of Humphrey Carpenter and Katherine Chandler. Judy Taylor, &quot;That Naughty Rabbit: Beatrix Potter and Peter Rabbit&quot; (rev. 2002) tells the story of the first publication and many editions.

Potter&#x27;s country life, her farming and role as a landscape preservationist are discussed in the work of Matthew Kelly, &quot;The Women Who Saved the English Countryside&quot; (2022). See also Susan Denyer and authors in the publications of The National Trust, such as &quot;Beatrix Potter at Home in the Lake District&quot; (2004).

Potter&#x27;s work as a scientific illustrator and her work in mycology are discussed in Linda Lear&#x27;s books &quot;Beatrix Potter: A Life in Nature&quot; (2006) and &quot;Beatrix Potter: The Extraordinary Life of a Victorian Genius&quot; (2008).

==Adaptations==

In 1971, a ballet film was released, &quot;The Tales of Beatrix Potter&quot;, directed by Reginald Mills, set to music by John Lanchbery with choreography by Frederick Ashton, and performed in character costume by members of the Royal Ballet and the Royal Opera House orchestra. The ballet of the same name has been performed by other dance companies around the world.

In 1992, Potter&#x27;s children&#x27;s book &quot;The Tale of Benjamin Bunny&quot; was featured in the film &quot;Lorenzo&#x27;s Oil&quot;.

Potter is also featured in Susan Wittig Albert&#x27;s series of light mysteries called &quot;The Cottage Tales of Beatrix Potter&quot;. The first of the eight-book series is &quot;Tale of Hill Top Farm&quot; (2004), which deals with Potter&#x27;s life in the Lake District and the village of Near Sawrey between 1905 and 1913.

==In film==

In 1982, the BBC produced &quot;The Tale of Beatrix Potter&quot;. This dramatization of her life was written by John Hawkesworth, directed by Bill Hayes, and starred Holly Aird and Penelope Wilton as the young and adult Potter, respectively. &quot;The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends&quot;, a TV series based on nine of her twenty-four stories, starred actress Niamh Cusack as Beatrix Potter.

In 1993, Weston Woods Studios made an almost hour non-story film called &quot;Beatrix Potter: Artist, Storyteller, and Countrywoman&quot; with narration by Lynn Redgrave. In 2006, Chris Noonan directed &quot;Miss Potter&quot;, a biographical film of Potter&#x27;s life focusing on her early career and romance with her editor Norman Warne. The film stars Renée Zellweger as Beatrix Potter, Ewan McGregor as Norman Warne, and Emily Watson as Warne&#x27;s sister.

On 9 February 2018, Columbia Pictures released &quot;Peter Rabbit&quot;, directed by Will Gluck, based on the work by Potter. The character Bea, played by Rose Byrne, is a re-imagined version of Potter. A sequel to the film titled &quot;Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway&quot; was released in 2021.

On 24 December 2020, Sky One premiered &quot;Roald &amp; Beatrix: The Tail of the Curious Mouse&quot;, a made-for-television drama film inspired by the true story of a six-year-old Roald Dahl meeting his idol Potter. Set in 1922, the movie was written by Abigail Wilson, directed by David Kerr and starred Dawn French as Beatrix Potter, Rob Brydon as William Heelis and Jessica Hynes as Sofie Dahl. Filming took place in Wales, the birthland of Dahl, French and Brydon. This production incorporates live action, stop motion, and puppetry. The DVD was released on 26 April 2021.

<text>The Liberal Party was one of the two major political parties in the United Kingdom, along with the Conservative Party, in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Beginning as an alliance of Whigs, free trade–supporting Peelites, and reformist Radicals in the 1850s, by the end of the 19th century, it had formed four governments under William Ewart Gladstone. Despite being divided over the issue of Irish Home Rule, the party returned to government in 1905 and won a landslide victory in the 1906 general election. Under prime ministers Henry Campbell-Bannerman (1905–1908) and H. H. Asquith (1908–1916), the Liberal Party passed reforms that created a basic welfare state. Although Asquith was the party leader, its dominant figure was David Lloyd George. 

Asquith was overwhelmed by his wartime role as prime minister and Lloyd George led a coalition that replaced him in late 1916. However, Asquith remained as Liberal Party leader. The split between Lloyd George&#x27;s breakaway faction and Asquith&#x27;s official Liberal faction badly weakened the party. The coalition government of Lloyd George was increasingly dominated by the Conservative Party, which finally ousted him as prime minister in 1922. The subsequent Liberal collapse was quick and catastrophic. With 400 MPs elected in the 1906 election; they had only 40 in 1924. Their share of the popular vote plunged from 49% to 18%. The Labour Party absorbed most of the ex-Liberal voters and then became the Conservatives&#x27; main rival. 

By the 1950s, the party had won as few as six seats at general elections. Apart from a few notable by-election victories, its fortunes did not improve significantly until it formed the SDP–Liberal Alliance with the newly formed Social Democratic Party (SDP) in 1981. At the 1983 general election, the Alliance won over a quarter of the vote, but won only 23 of the 633 seats it contested. At the 1987 general election, its share of the vote fell below 23%. Further, the Liberals and the SDP merged in 1988 to form the Social and Liberal Democrats (SLD), who the following year were renamed the Liberal Democrats. A splinter group reconstituted the Liberal Party in 1989.

The Liberals were a coalition with diverse positions on major issues and no unified national policy. This made them repeatedly liable to deep splits, such as that of the Liberal Unionists in 1886 (they eventually joined the Conservative Party); the faction of labour union members that joined the new Labour Party; the split between factions led by Asquith and that led by Lloyd George in 1918–1922; and a three-way split in 1931. Many prominent intellectuals were active in the party, including philosopher John Stuart Mill, economist John Maynard Keynes, and social planner William Beveridge. Winston Churchill during his years as a Liberal (1904–1924) authored &quot;Liberalism and the Social Problem&quot; (1909).

== History ==
=== Origins ===

The Liberal Party grew out of the Whigs, who had their origins in an aristocratic faction in the reign of Charles II and the early 19th century Radicals. The Whigs were in favour of reducing the power of the Crown and increasing the power of Parliament. Although their motives in this were originally to gain more power for themselves, the more idealistic Whigs gradually came to support an expansion of democracy for its own sake. The great figures of reformist Whiggery were Charles James Fox (died 1806) and his disciple and successor Earl Grey. After decades in opposition, the Whigs returned to power under Grey in 1830 and carried the First Reform Act in 1832.

The Reform Act was the climax of Whiggism, but it also brought about the Whigs&#x27; demise. The admission of the middle classes to the franchise and to the House of Commons led eventually to the development of a systematic middle-class liberalism and the end of Whiggery, although for many years reforming aristocrats held senior positions in the party. In the years after Grey&#x27;s retirement, the party was led first by Lord Melbourne, a fairly traditional Whig, and then by Lord John Russell, the son of a Duke but a crusading radical, and by Lord Palmerston, a renegade Irish Tory and essentially a conservative, although capable of radical gestures.

As early as 1839, Russell had adopted the name of &quot;Liberals&quot;, but in reality, his party was a loose coalition of Whigs in the House of Lords and Radicals in the Commons. The leading Radicals were John Bright and Richard Cobden, who represented the manufacturing towns which had gained representation under the Reform Act. They favoured social reform, personal liberty, reducing the powers of the Crown and the Church of England (many Liberals were Nonconformists), avoidance of war and foreign alliances (which were bad for business) and above all free trade. For a century, free trade remained the one cause which could unite all Liberals.

In 1841, the Liberals lost office to the Conservatives under Sir Robert Peel, but their period in opposition was short because the Conservatives split over the repeal of the Corn Laws, a free trade issue; and a faction known as the Peelites (but not Peel himself, who died soon after) aligned to the Liberal side on the issue of free trade. This allowed ministries led by Russell, Palmerston and the Peelite Lord Aberdeen to hold office for most of the 1850s and 1860s. A leading Peelite was William Gladstone, who was a reforming Chancellor of the Exchequer in most of these governments. The formal foundation of the Liberal Party is traditionally traced to 1859 when the remaining Peelites, Radicals and Whigs agreed to vote down the incumbent Conservative government. This meeting was held at the Willis&#x27; rooms in London on 6 June 1859. This led to Palmerston&#x27;s second government.

However, the Whig-Radical amalgam could not become a true modern political party while it was dominated by aristocrats and it was not until the departure of the &quot;Two Terrible Old Men&quot;, Russell and Palmerston, that Gladstone could become the first leader of the modern Liberal Party. This was brought about by Palmerston&#x27;s death in 1865 and Russell&#x27;s retirement in 1868. After a brief Conservative government (during which the Second Reform Act was passed by agreement between the parties), Gladstone won a huge victory at the 1868 election and formed the first Liberal government. The establishment of the party as a national membership organisation came with the foundation of the National Liberal Federation in 1877. The philosopher John Stuart Mill was also a Liberal MP from 1865 to 1868.

=== Gladstone era ===
For the next 30 years, Gladstone and Liberalism were synonymous. William Gladstone served as prime minister four times (1868–74, 1880–85, 1886, and 1892–94). His financial policies, based on the notion of balanced budgets, low taxes and &quot;laissez-faire&quot;, were suited to a developing capitalist society, but they could not respond effectively as economic and social conditions changed. Called the &quot;Grand Old Man&quot; later in life, Gladstone was always a dynamic popular orator who appealed strongly to the working class and to the lower middle class. Deeply religious, Gladstone brought a new moral tone to politics, with his evangelical sensibility and his opposition to aristocracy. His moralism often angered his upper-class opponents (including Queen Victoria), and his heavy-handed control split the Liberal Party.

In foreign policy, Gladstone was in general against foreign entanglements, but he did not resist the realities of imperialism. For example, he ordered the occupation of Egypt by British forces in the 1882 Anglo-Egyptian War. His goal was to create a European order based on co-operation rather than conflict and on mutual trust instead of rivalry and suspicion; the rule of law was to supplant the reign of force and self-interest. This Gladstonian concept of a harmonious Concert of Europe was opposed to and ultimately defeated by a Bismarckian system of manipulated alliances and antagonisms.

As prime minister from 1868 to 1874, Gladstone headed a Liberal Party which was a coalition of Peelites like himself, Whigs and Radicals. He was now a spokesman for &quot;peace, economy and reform&quot;. One major achievement was the Elementary Education Act 1870 (33 &amp; 34 Vict. c. 75), which provided England with an adequate system of elementary schools for the first time. He also secured the abolition of the purchase of commissions in the British Army and of religious tests for admission to Oxford and Cambridge; the introduction of the secret ballot in elections; the legalization of trade unions; and the reorganization of the judiciary in the Judicature Act.

Regarding Ireland, the major Liberal achievements were land reform, where he ended centuries of landlord oppression, and the disestablishment of the (Anglican) Church of Ireland through the Irish Church Act 1869.

In the 1874 general election, Gladstone was defeated by the Conservatives under Benjamin Disraeli during a sharp economic recession. He formally resigned as Liberal leader and was succeeded by the Marquess of Hartington, but he soon changed his mind and returned to active politics. He strongly disagreed with Disraeli&#x27;s pro-Ottoman foreign policy and in 1880 he conducted the first outdoor mass-election campaign in Britain, known as the Midlothian campaign. The Liberals won a large majority in the 1880 election. Hartington ceded his place and Gladstone resumed office.

==== Ireland and Home Rule ====

Among the consequences of the Third Reform Act (1884) was the giving of the vote to many Irish Catholics. In the 1885 general election the Irish Parliamentary Party held the balance of power in the House of Commons and demanded Irish Home Rule as the price of support for a continued Gladstone ministry. Gladstone personally supported Home Rule, but a strong Liberal Unionist faction led by Joseph Chamberlain, along with the last of the Whigs, Hartington, opposed it. The Irish Home Rule bill proposed to offer all owners of Irish land a chance to sell to the state at a price equal to 20 years&#x27; purchase of the rents and allowing tenants to purchase the land. Irish nationalist reaction was mixed, Unionist opinion was hostile, and the election addresses during the 1886 election revealed English radicals to be against the bill also. Among the Liberal rank and file, several Gladstonian candidates disowned the bill, reflecting fears at the constituency level that the interests of the working people were being sacrificed to finance a costly rescue operation for the landed élite. Further, Home Rule had not been promised in the Liberals&#x27; election manifesto, and so the impression was given that Gladstone was buying Irish support in a rather desperate manner to hold on to power.

The result was a catastrophic split in the Liberal Party, and heavy defeat in the 1886 election at the hands of Lord Salisbury, who was supported by the breakaway Liberal Unionist Party. There was a final weak Gladstone ministry in 1892, but it also was dependent on Irish support and failed to get Irish Home Rule through the House of Lords.

==== Newcastle Programme ====

Historically, the aristocracy was divided between Conservatives and Liberals. However, when Gladstone committed to home rule for Ireland, Britain&#x27;s upper classes largely abandoned the Liberal party, giving the Conservatives a large permanent majority in the House of Lords. Following the Queen, High Society in London largely ostracized home rulers and Liberal clubs were badly split. Joseph Chamberlain took a major element of upper-class supporters out of the Party and into a third party called Liberal Unionism on the Irish issue. It collaborated with and eventually merged into the Conservative party. The Gladstonian liberals in 1891 adopted The Newcastle Programme that included home rule for Ireland, disestablishment of the Church of England in Wales, tighter controls on the sale of liquor, major extension of factory regulation and various democratic political reforms. The Programme had a strong appeal to the nonconformist middle-class Liberal element, which felt liberated by the departure of the aristocracy.

==== Relations with trade unions ====

A major long-term consequence of the Third Reform Act was the rise of Lib-Lab candidates. The Act split all county constituencies (which were represented by multiple MPs) into single-member constituencies, roughly corresponding to population patterns. With the foundation of the Labour Party not to come till 1906, many trade unions allied themselves with the Liberals. In areas with working class majorities, in particular coal-mining areas, Lib-Lab candidates were popular, and they received sponsorship and endorsement from trade unions. In the first election after the Act was passed (1885), thirteen were elected, up from two in 1874. The Third Reform Act also facilitated the demise of the Whig old guard; in two-member constituencies, it was common to pair a Whig and a radical under the Liberal banner. After the Third Reform Act, fewer former Whigs were selected as candidates.

==== Reform policies ====
A broad range of interventionist reforms were introduced by the 1892–1895 Liberal government. Amongst other measures, standards of accommodation and of teaching in schools were improved, factory inspection was made more stringent, and ministers used their powers to increase the wages and reduce the working hours of large numbers of male workers employed by the state.

Historian Walter L. Arnstein concludes:

=== After Gladstone ===

Gladstone finally retired in 1894. Gladstone&#x27;s support for Home Rule deeply divided the party, and it lost its upper and upper-middle-class base, while keeping support among Protestant nonconformists and the Celtic fringe. Historian R. C. K. Ensor reports that after 1886, the main Liberal Party was deserted by practically the entire whig peerage and the great majority of the upper-class and upper-middle-class members. High prestige London clubs that had a Liberal base were deeply split. Ensor notes that, &quot;London society, following the known views of the Queen, practically ostracized home rulers.&quot;

The new Liberal leader was the ineffectual Lord Rosebery. He led the party to a heavy defeat in the 1895 general election.

=== Liberal factions ===

The Liberal Party lacked a unified ideological base in 1906. It contained numerous contradictory and hostile factions, such as imperialists and supporters of the Boers; near-socialists and laissez-faire classical liberals; suffragettes and opponents of women&#x27;s suffrage; antiwar elements and supporters of the military alliance with France. Nonconformists – Protestants outside the Anglican fold – were a powerful element, dedicated to opposing the established church in terms of education and taxation. However, the non-conformists were losing support amid society at large and played a lesser role in party affairs after 1900. The party, furthermore, also included Irish Catholics, and secularists from the labour movement. Many Conservatives (including Winston Churchill) had recently protested against high tariff moves by the Conservatives by switching to the anti-tariff Liberal camp, but it was unclear how many old Conservative traits they brought along, especially on military and naval issues.

The middle-class business, professional and intellectual communities were generally strongholds, although some old aristocratic families played important roles as well. The working-class element was moving rapidly toward the newly emerging Labour Party. One uniting element was widespread agreement on the use of politics and Parliament as a device to upgrade and improve society and to reform politics. All Liberals were outraged when Conservatives used their majority in the House of Lords to block reform legislation. In the House of Lords, the Liberals had lost most of their members, who in the 1890s &quot;became Conservative in all but name.&quot; The government could force the unwilling king to create new Liberal peers, and that threat did prove decisive in the battle for dominance of Commons over Lords in 1911.

=== Rise of New Liberalism ===

The late nineteenth century saw the emergence of New Liberalism within the Liberal Party, which advocated state intervention as a means of guaranteeing freedom and removing obstacles to it such as poverty and unemployment. The policies of the New Liberalism are now known as social liberalism.
The New Liberals included intellectuals like L. T. Hobhouse, and John A. Hobson. They saw individual liberty as something achievable only under favourable social and economic circumstances. In their view, the poverty, squalor, and ignorance in which many people lived made it impossible for freedom and individuality to flourish. New Liberals believed that these conditions could be ameliorated only through collective action coordinated by a strong, welfare-oriented, and interventionist state.

After the historic 1906 victory, the Liberal Party introduced multiple reforms on a range of issues, including health insurance, unemployment insurance, and pensions for elderly workers, thereby laying the groundwork for the future British welfare state. Some proposals failed, such as licensing fewer pubs, or rolling back Conservative educational policies. The People&#x27;s Budget of 1909, championed by David Lloyd George and fellow Liberal Winston Churchill, introduced unprecedented taxes on the wealthy in Britain and radical social welfare programmes to the country&#x27;s policies. In the Liberal camp, as noted by one study, &quot;the Budget was on the whole enthusiastically received.&quot; It was the first budget with the expressed intent of redistributing wealth among the public. It imposed increased taxes on luxuries, liquor, tobacco, high incomes, and land – taxation that fell heavily on the rich. The new money was to be made available for new welfare programmes as well as new battleships. In 1911 Lloyd George succeeded in putting through Parliament his National Insurance Act, making provision for sickness and invalidism, and this was followed by his Unemployment Insurance Act.

Historian Peter Weiler argues:
Contrasting Old Liberalism with New Liberalism, David Lloyd George noted in a 1908 speech the following:
=== Liberal zenith ===

The Liberals languished in opposition for a decade while the coalition of Salisbury and Chamberlain held power. The 1890s were marred by infighting between the three principal successors to Gladstone, party leader William Harcourt, former prime minister Lord Rosebery, and Gladstone&#x27;s personal secretary, John Morley. This intrigue finally led Harcourt and Morley to resign their positions in 1898 as they continued to be at loggerheads with Rosebery over Irish home rule and issues relating to imperialism. Replacing Harcourt as party leader was Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman. Harcourt&#x27;s resignation briefly muted the turmoil in the party, but the beginning of the Second Boer War soon nearly broke the party apart, with Rosebery and a circle of supporters including important future Liberal figures H. H. Asquith, Edward Grey and Richard Burdon Haldane forming a clique dubbed the Liberal Imperialists that supported the government in the prosecution of the war. On the other side, more radical members of the party formed a Pro-Boer faction that denounced the conflict and called for an immediate end to hostilities. Quickly rising to prominence among the Pro-Boers was David Lloyd George, a relatively new MP and a master of rhetoric, who took advantage of having a national stage to speak out on a controversial issue to make his name in the party. Harcourt and Morley also sided with this group, though with slightly different aims. Campbell-Bannerman tried to keep these forces together at the head of a moderate Liberal rump, but in 1901 he delivered a speech on the government&#x27;s &quot;methods of barbarism&quot; in South Africa that pulled him further to the left and nearly tore the party in two. The party was saved after Salisbury&#x27;s retirement in 1902 when his successor, Arthur Balfour, pushed a series of unpopular initiatives such as the Education Act 1902 and Joseph Chamberlain called for a new system of protectionist tariffs.

Campbell-Bannerman was able to rally the party around the traditional liberal platform of free trade and land reform and led them to the greatest election victory in their history. This would prove the last time the Liberals won a majority in their own right. Although he presided over a large majority, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman was overshadowed by his ministers, most notably H. H. Asquith at the Exchequer, Edward Grey at the Foreign Office, Richard Burdon Haldane at the War Office and David Lloyd George at the Board of Trade. Campbell-Bannerman retired in 1908 and died soon after. He was succeeded by Asquith, who stepped up the government&#x27;s radicalism. Lloyd George succeeded Asquith at the Exchequer and was in turn succeeded at the Board of Trade by Winston Churchill, a recent defector from the Conservatives.
The 1906 general election also represented a shift to the left by the Liberal Party. According to Rosemary Rees, almost half of the Liberal MPs elected in 1906 were supportive of the &#x27;New Liberalism&#x27; (which advocated government action to improve people&#x27;s lives),) while claims were made that &quot;five-sixths of the Liberal party are left wing.&quot; Other historians, however, have questioned the extent to which the Liberal Party experienced a leftward shift; according to Robert C. Self however, only between 50 and 60 Liberal MPs out of the 400 in the parliamentary party after 1906 were Social Radicals, with a core of 20 to 30. Nevertheless, important junior offices were held in the cabinet by what Duncan Tanner has termed &quot;genuine New Liberals, Centrist reformers, and Fabian collectivists,&quot; and much legislation was pushed through by the Liberals in government. This included the regulation of working hours, National Insurance and welfare.
A political battle erupted over the People&#x27;s Budget, which was rejected by the House of Lords and for which the government obtained an electoral mandate at the January 1910 election. The election resulted in a hung parliament, with the government left dependent on the Irish Nationalists. Although the Lords now passed the budget, the government wished to curtail their power to block legislation. Asquith was required by King George V to fight a second general election in December 1910 (whose result was little changed from that in January) before he agreed, if necessary, to create hundreds of Liberals peers. Faced with that threat, the Lords voted to give up their veto power and allowed the passage of the Parliament Act 1911.

As the price of Irish support, Asquith was now forced to introduce a third Home Rule bill in 1912. Since the House of Lords no longer had the power to block the bill, but only to delay it for two years, it was due to become law in 1914. The Unionist Ulster Volunteers, led by Sir Edward Carson, launched a campaign of opposition that included the threat of a provisional government and armed resistance in Ulster. The Ulster Protestants had the full support of the Conservatives, whose leader, Bonar Law, was of Ulster-Scots descent. Government plans to deploy troops into Ulster had to be cancelled after the threat of mass resignation of their commissions by army officers in March 1914 (&quot;see Curragh Incident&quot;). Ireland seemed to be on the brink of civil war when the First World War broke out in August 1914. Asquith had offered the Six Counties (later to become Northern Ireland) an opt out from Home Rule for six years (i.e., until after two more general elections were likely to have taken place) but the Nationalists refused to agree to permanent Partition of Ireland. Historian George Dangerfield has argued that the multiplicity of crises in 1910 to 1914, political and industrial, so weakened the Liberal coalition before the war broke out that it marked the &quot;Strange Death of Liberal England&quot;. However, most historians date the collapse to the crisis of the First World War.

=== Decline ===
The Liberal Party might have survived a short war, but the totality of the Great War called for measures that the Party had long rejected. The result was the permanent destruction of the ability of the Liberal Party to lead a government. Historian Robert Blake explains the dilemma:
Blake further notes that it was the Liberals, not the Conservatives who needed the moral outrage of Belgium to justify going to war, while the Conservatives called for intervention from the start of the crisis on the grounds of &quot;realpolitik&quot; and the balance of power. However, Lloyd George and Churchill were zealous supporters of the war, and gradually forced the old peace-orientated Liberals out.

Asquith was blamed for the poor British performance in the first year. Since the Liberals ran the war without consulting the Conservatives, there were heavy partisan attacks. However, even Liberal commentators were dismayed by the lack of energy at the top. At the time, public opinion was intensely hostile, both in the media and in the street, against any young man in civilian garb and labeled as a slacker. The leading Liberal newspaper, the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; complained:
Asquith&#x27;s Liberal government was brought down in , due in particular to a crisis in inadequate artillery shell production and the protest resignation of Admiral Fisher over the disastrous Gallipoli Campaign against Turkey. Reluctant to face doom in an election, Asquith formed a new coalition government on 25 May, with the majority of the new cabinet coming from his own Liberal party and the Unionist (Conservative) party, along with a token Labour representation. The new government lasted a year and a half and was the last time Liberals controlled the government. The analysis of historian A. J. P. Taylor is that the British people were so deeply divided over numerous issues, but on all sides, there was growing distrust of the Asquith government. There was no agreement whatsoever on wartime issues. The leaders of the two parties realized that embittered debates in Parliament would further undermine popular morale and so the House of Commons did not once discuss the war before May 1915. Taylor argues:
The 1915 coalition fell apart at the end of 1916, when the Conservatives withdrew their support from Asquith and gave it instead to Lloyd George, who became prime minister at the head of a new coalition largely made up of Conservatives. Asquith and his followers moved to the opposition benches in Parliament and the Liberal Party was deeply split once again.

=== Lloyd George as a Liberal heading a Conservative coalition ===

Lloyd George remained a Liberal all his life, but he abandoned many standard Liberal principles in his crusade to win the war at all costs. He insisted on strong government controls over business as opposed to the &quot;laissez-faire&quot; attitudes of traditional Liberals. in 1915–16 he had insisted on conscription of young men into the Army, a position that deeply troubled his old colleagues. That brought him and a few like-minded Liberals into the new coalition on the ground long occupied by Conservatives. There was no more planning for world peace or liberal treatment of Germany, nor discomfit with aggressive and authoritarian measures of state power. More deadly to the future of the party, says historian Trevor Wilson, was its repudiation by ideological Liberals, who decided sadly that it no longer represented their principles. Finally, the presence of the vigorous new Labour Party on the left gave a new home to voters disenchanted with the Liberal performance.

The last majority Liberal Government in Britain was elected in 1906. The years preceding the First World War were marked by worker strikes and civil unrest and saw many violent confrontations between civilians and the police and armed forces. Other issues of the period included women&#x27;s suffrage and the Irish Home Rule movement. After the carnage of 1914–1918, the democratic reforms of the Representation of the People Act 1918 instantly tripled the number of people entitled to vote in Britain from seven to twenty-one million. The Labour Party benefited most from this huge change in the electorate, forming its first minority government in 1924.
In the 1918 general election, Lloyd George, hailed as &quot;the Man Who Won the War&quot;, led his coalition into a khaki election. Lloyd George and the Conservative leader Bonar Law wrote a joint letter of support to candidates to indicate they were considered the official Coalition candidates—this &quot;coupon&quot;, as it became known, was issued against many sitting Liberal MPs, often to devastating effect, though not against Asquith himself. The coalition won a massive victory: Labour increased their position slightly, but the Asquithian Liberals were decimated. Those remaining Liberal MPs who were opposed to the Coalition Government went into opposition under the parliamentary leadership of Sir Donald MacLean who also became Leader of the Opposition. Asquith, who had appointed MacLean, remained as overall Leader of the Liberal Party even though he lost his seat in 1918. Asquith returned to Parliament in 1920 and resumed leadership. Between 1919 and 1923, the anti-Lloyd George Liberals were called Asquithian Liberals, Wee Free Liberals or Independent Liberals.

Lloyd George was increasingly under the influence of the rejuvenated Conservative party who numerically dominated the coalition. In 1922, the Conservative backbenchers rebelled against the continuation of the coalition, citing, in particular, Lloyd George&#x27;s plan for war with Turkey in the Chanak Crisis, and his corrupt sale of honours. He resigned as prime minister and was succeeded by Bonar Law.

At the 1922 and 1923 elections, the Liberals won barely a third of the vote and only a quarter of the seats in the House of Commons as many radical voters abandoned the divided Liberals and went over to Labour. In 1922, Labour became the official opposition. A reunion of the two warring factions took place in 1923 when the new Conservative prime minister Stanley Baldwin committed his party to protective tariffs, causing the Liberals to reunite in support of free trade. The party gained ground in the 1923 general election but made most of its gains from Conservatives whilst losing ground to Labour—a sign of the party&#x27;s direction for many years to come. The party remained the third largest in the House of Commons, but the Conservatives had lost their majority. There was much speculation and fear &quot;[by whom?]&quot; about the prospect of a Labour government and comparatively little about a Liberal government, even though it could have plausibly presented an experienced team of ministers compared to Labour&#x27;s almost complete lack of experience as well as offering a middle ground that could obtain support from both Conservatives and Labour in crucial Commons divisions. However, instead of trying to force the opportunity to form a Liberal government, Asquith decided instead to allow Labour the chance of office in the belief that they would prove incompetent, and this would set the stage for a revival of Liberal fortunes at Labour&#x27;s expense, but it was a fatal error.
Labour was determined to destroy the Liberals and become the sole party of the left. Ramsay MacDonald was forced into a snap election in 1924 and although his government was defeated, he achieved his objective of virtually wiping the Liberals out as many more radical voters now moved to Labour whilst moderate middle-class Liberal voters concerned about socialism moved to the Conservatives. The Liberals were reduced to a mere forty seats in Parliament, only seven of which had been won against candidates from both parties and none of these formed a coherent area of Liberal survival. The party seemed finished, and during this period some Liberals, such as Churchill, went over to the Conservatives while others went over to Labour. Several Labour ministers of later generations, such as Michael Foot and Tony Benn, were the sons of Liberal MPs.

Asquith finally resigned as Liberal leader in 1926 (he died in 1928). Lloyd George, now party leader, began a drive to produce coherent policies on many key issues of the day. In the 1929 general election, he made a final bid to return the Liberals to the political mainstream, with an ambitious programme of state stimulation of the economy called &quot;We Can Conquer Unemployment!&quot;, largely written for him by the Liberal economist John Maynard Keynes. The Liberal Party stood in Northern Ireland for the first and only time in the 1929 general election, gaining 17% of the vote, but won no seats. Nationally the Liberals gained ground, but once again it was at the Conservatives&#x27; expense whilst also losing seats to Labour. Indeed, the urban areas of the country suffering heavily from unemployment, which might have been expected to respond the most to the radical economic policies of the Liberals, instead gave the party its worst results. By contrast, most of the party&#x27;s seats were won either due to the absence of a candidate from one of the other parties or in rural areas on the Celtic fringe, where local evidence suggests that economic ideas were at best peripheral to the electorate&#x27;s concerns. The Liberals now found themselves with 59 members, holding the balance of power in a Parliament where Labour was the largest party but lacked an overall majority. Lloyd George offered a degree of support to the Labour government in the hope of winning concessions, including a degree of electoral reform to introduce the alternative vote, but this support was to prove bitterly divisive as the Liberals increasingly divided between those seeking to gain what Liberal goals they could achieve, those who preferred a Conservative government to a Labour one and vice versa.

=== Splits over the National Government ===
A group of Liberal MPs led by Sir John Simon opposed the Liberal Party&#x27;s support for the minority Labour government. They preferred to reach an accommodation with the Conservatives. In 1931 MacDonald&#x27;s Labour government fell apart in response to the Great Depression. Macdonald agreed to lead a National Government of all parties, which passed a budget to deal with the financial crisis. When few Labour MPs backed the National government, it became clear that the Conservatives had the clear majority of government supporters. They then forced MacDonald to call a general election. Lloyd George called for the party to leave the National Government but only a few MPs and candidates followed. The majority, led by Sir Herbert Samuel, decided to contest the elections as part of the government. The bulk of Liberal MPs supported the government, – the Liberal Nationals (officially the &quot;National Liberals&quot; after 1947) led by Simon, also known as &quot;Simonites&quot;, and the &quot;Samuelites&quot; or &quot;official Liberals&quot;, led by Samuel who remained as the official party. Both groups secured about 34 MPs but proceeded to diverge even further after the election, with the Liberal Nationals remaining supporters of the government throughout its life. There were to be a succession of discussions about them rejoining the Liberals, but these usually foundered on the issues of free trade and continued support for the National Government. The one significant reunification came in 1946 when the Liberal and Liberal National party organisations in London merged. The National Liberals, as they were called by then, were gradually absorbed into the Conservative Party, finally merging in 1968.

The official Liberals found themselves a tiny minority within a government committed to protectionism. Slowly they found this issue to be one they could not support. In early 1932 it was agreed to suspend the principle of collective responsibility to allow the Liberals to oppose the introduction of tariffs. Later in 1932 the Liberals resigned their ministerial posts over the introduction of the Ottawa Agreement on Imperial Preference. However, they remained sitting on the government benches supporting it in Parliament, though in the country local Liberal activists bitterly opposed the government. Finally in late 1933 the Liberals crossed the floor of the House of Commons and went into complete opposition. By this point their number of MPs was severely depleted. In the 1935 general election, just 17 Liberal MPs were elected, along with Lloyd George and three followers as independent Liberals. Immediately after the election the two groups reunited, though Lloyd George declined to play much of a formal role in his old party. Over the next ten years there would be further defections as MPs deserted to either the Liberal Nationals or Labour. Yet there were a few recruits, such as Clement Davies, who had deserted to the National Liberals in 1931 but now returned to the party during World War II and who would lead it after the war.

=== Near extinction ===
Samuel had lost his seat in the 1935 election and the leadership of the party fell to Sir Archibald Sinclair. With many traditional domestic Liberal policies now regarded as irrelevant, he focused the party on opposition to both the rise of Fascism in Europe and the appeasement foreign policy of the National Government, arguing that intervention was needed, in contrast to the Labour calls for pacifism. Despite the party&#x27;s weaknesses, Sinclair gained a high profile as he sought to recall the Midlothian Campaign and once more revitalise the Liberals as the party of a strong foreign policy.

In 1940, they joined Churchill&#x27;s wartime coalition government, with Sinclair serving as Secretary of State for Air, the last British Liberal to hold Cabinet rank office for seventy years. However, it was a sign of the party&#x27;s lack of importance that they were not included in the War Cabinet; some leading party members founded Radical Action, a group which called for liberal candidates to break the war-time electoral pact. At the 1945 general election, Sinclair and many of his colleagues lost their seats to both Conservatives and Labour and the party returned just 12 MPs to Westminster, but this was just the beginning of the decline. In 1950, the general election saw the Liberals return just nine MPs. Another general election was called in 1951 and the Liberals were left with just six MPs and all but one of them were aided by the fact that the Conservatives refrained from fielding candidates in those constituencies.

In 1957, this total fell to five when one of the Liberal MPs died and the subsequent by-election was lost to the Labour Party, which selected the former Liberal Deputy Leader Megan Lloyd George as its own candidate. The Liberal Party seemed close to extinction. During this low period, it was often joked that Liberal MPs could hold meetings in the back of one taxi.

=== Liberal revival ===

Through the 1950s and into the 1960s, the Liberals survived only because a handful of constituencies in rural Scotland and Wales clung to their Liberal traditions, whilst in two English towns, Bolton and Huddersfield, local Liberals and Conservatives agreed to each contest only one of the town&#x27;s two seats. Jo Grimond, for example, who became Leader of the Liberal Party in 1956, was MP for the remote Orkney and Shetland islands. Under his leadership a Liberal revival began, marked by the Orpington by-election of March 1962 which was won by Eric Lubbock. There, the Liberals won a seat in the London suburbs for the first time since 1935.

The Liberals became the first of the major British political parties to advocate British membership of the European Economic Community. Grimond also sought an intellectual revival of the party, seeking to position it as a non-socialist radical alternative to the Conservative government of the day. In particular he canvassed the support of the young post-war university students and recent graduates, appealing to younger voters in a way that many of his recent predecessors had not, and asserting a new strand of Liberalism for the post-war world.

The new middle-class suburban generation began to find the Liberals&#x27; policies attractive again. Under Grimond (who retired in 1967) and his successor, Jeremy Thorpe, the Liberals regained the status of a serious third force in British politics, polling up to 20% of the vote, but unable to break the duopoly of Labour and Conservative and win more than fourteen seats in the Commons. An additional problem was competition in the Liberal heartlands in Scotland and Wales from the Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru who both grew as electoral forces from the 1960s onwards. Although Emlyn Hooson held on to the seat of Montgomeryshire, upon Clement Davies death in 1962, the party lost five Welsh seats between 1950 and 1966. In September 1966, the Welsh Liberal Party formed their own state party, moving the Liberal Party into a fully federal structure.

In local elections, Liverpool remained a Liberal stronghold, with the party taking the plurality of seats on the elections to the new Liverpool Metropolitan Borough Council in 1973. On 26 July 1973, the party won two by-elections on the same day, in the Isle of Ely (with Clement Freud), and Ripon (with David Austick). In the February 1974 general election, the Conservative government of Edward Heath won a plurality of votes cast, but the Labour Party gained a plurality of seats. The Conservatives were unable to form a government due to the Ulster Unionist MPs refusing to support the Conservatives after the Northern Ireland Sunningdale Agreement. The Liberals obtained 6.1 million votes, the most it would ever achieve, and now held the balance of power in the Commons. Conservatives offered Thorpe the Home Office if he would join a coalition government with Heath. Thorpe was personally in favour of it, but the party insisted it would only agree pending a clear government commitment to introducing proportional representation (PR) and a change of prime minister. The former was unacceptable to Heath&#x27;s cabinet and the latter to Heath personally, so the talks collapsed. Instead, a minority Labour government was formed under Harold Wilson but with no formal support from Thorpe. In the October 1974 general election, the Liberals total vote slipped back slightly (and declined in each of the next three) and the Labour government won a wafer-thin majority.

Thorpe was subsequently forced to resign after allegations that he attempted to have his homosexual lover murdered by a hitman. The party&#x27;s new leader, David Steel, negotiated the Lib-Lab pact with Wilson&#x27;s successor as prime minister, James Callaghan. According to this pact, the Liberals would support the government in crucial votes in exchange for some influence over policy. The agreement lasted from 1977 to 1978, but proved mostly fruitless, for two reasons: the Liberals&#x27; key demand of PR was rejected by most Labour MPs, whilst the contacts between Liberal spokespersons and Labour ministers often proved detrimental, such as between Treasury spokesperson John Pardoe and Chancellor of the Exchequer Denis Healey, who were mutually antagonistic.

=== Alliance, Liberal Democrats and reconstituted Liberal Party ===
The Conservative Party under the leadership of Margaret Thatcher won the 1979 general election, placing the Labour Party back in opposition, which served to push the Liberals back into the margins.

In 1981, defectors from a moderate faction of the Labour Party, led by former Cabinet ministers Roy Jenkins, David Owen and Shirley Williams, founded the Social Democratic Party (SDP). The new party and the Liberals quickly formed the SDP–Liberal Alliance, which for a while polled as high as 50% in the opinion polls and appeared capable of winning the next general election. Indeed, Steel was so confident of an Alliance victory that he told the 1981 Liberal conference, &quot;Go back to your constituencies, and prepare for government!&quot;.

However, the Alliance was overtaken in the polls by the Tories in the aftermath of the Falkland Islands War and at the 1983 general election the Conservatives were re-elected by a landslide, with Labour once again forming the opposition. While the SDP–Liberal Alliance came close to Labour in terms of votes (a share of more than 25%), it only had 23 MPs compared to Labour&#x27;s 209. The Alliance&#x27;s support was spread out across the country, and was not concentrated in enough areas to translate into seats.

In the 1987 general election, the Alliance&#x27;s share of the votes fell slightly and it now had 22 MPs. In the election&#x27;s aftermath Steel proposed a merger of the two parties. Most SDP members voted in favour of the merger, but SDP leader David Owen objected and continued to lead a &quot;rump&quot; SDP.

In March 1988, the Liberal Party and Social Democratic Party merged to create the Social and Liberal Democrats, renamed the Liberal Democrats in October 1989. Over two-thirds of Liberal members joined the merged party, along with all sitting MPs. Steel and SDP leader Robert Maclennan served briefly as interim leaders of the merged party.

A group of Liberal opponents of the merger with the Social Democrats, including Michael Meadowcroft (the former Liberal MP for Leeds West) and Paul Wiggin (who served on Peterborough City Council as a Liberal), continued with a new party organisation under the name of the &#x27;Liberal Party&#x27;. Meadowcroft joined the Liberal Democrats in 2007, but the Liberal Party as reconstituted in 1989 continues to hold council seats and field candidates in Westminster Parliamentary elections. Only one of the twelve Liberal candidates in 2024 achieved 5% or more of the votes, resulting in all bar that one losing their deposits.

== Ideology ==
During the 19th century, the Liberal Party was broadly in favour of what would today be called classical liberalism, supporting &quot;laissez-faire&quot; economic policies such as free trade and minimal government interference in the economy (this doctrine was usually termed Gladstonian liberalism after the Victorian era Liberal Prime Minister William Gladstone). The Liberal Party favoured social reform, personal liberty, reducing the powers of the Crown and the Church of England (many of them were nonconformists) and an extension of the electoral franchise. Sir William Harcourt, a prominent Liberal politician in the Victorian era, said this about liberalism in 1872: If there be any party which is more pledged than another to resist a policy of restrictive legislation, having for its object social coercion, that party is the Liberal party. (Cheers.) But liberty does not consist in making others do what you think right, (Hear, hear.) The difference between a free Government and a Government which is not free is principally this—that a Government which is not free interferes with everything it can, and a free Government interferes with nothing except what it must. A despotic Government tries to make everybody do what it wishes; a Liberal Government tries, as far as the safety of society will permit, to allow everybody to do as he wishes. It has been the tradition of the Liberal party consistently to maintain the doctrine of individual liberty. It is because they have done so that England is the place where people can do more what they please than in any other country in the world. [...] It is this practice of allowing one set of people to dictate to another set of people what they shall do, what they shall think, what they shall drink, when they shall go to bed, what they shall buy, and where they shall buy it, what wages they shall get and how they shall spend them, against which the Liberal party have always protested.

The political terms of &quot;modern&quot;, &quot;progressive&quot; or &quot;new&quot; Liberalism began to appear in the mid to late 1880s and became increasingly common to denote the tendency in the Liberal Party to favour an increased role for the state as more important than the classical liberal stress on self-help and freedom of choice.

By the early 20th century, the Liberals stance began to shift towards &quot;New Liberalism&quot;, what would today be called social liberalism, namely a belief in personal liberty with a support for government intervention to provide social welfare. This shift was best exemplified by the Liberal government of H. H. Asquith and his Chancellor David Lloyd George, whose Liberal reforms in the early 1900s created a basic welfare state.

David Lloyd George adopted a programme at the 1929 general election entitled &quot;We Can Conquer Unemployment!&quot;, although by this stage the Liberals had declined to third-party status. The Liberals as expressed in the &quot;Liberal Yellow Book&quot; now regarded opposition to state intervention as being a characteristic of right-wing extremists.

After nearly becoming extinct in the 1940s and the 1950s, the Liberal Party revived its fortunes somewhat under the leadership of Jo Grimond in the 1960s by positioning itself as a radical centrist, non-socialist alternative to the Conservative and Labour Party governments of the time.

=== Religious alignment ===
Since 1660, nonconformist Protestants have played a major role in English politics. Relatively few MPs were Dissenters. However the Dissenters were a major voting bloc in many areas, such as the East Midlands. They were very well organised and highly motivated and largely won over the Whigs and Liberals to their cause. Down to the 1830s, Dissenters demanded removal of political and civil disabilities that applied to them (especially those in the Test and Corporation Acts). The Anglican establishment strongly resisted until 1828. Numerous reforms of voting rights, especially that of 1832, increased the political power of Dissenters. They demanded an end to compulsory church rates, in which local taxes went only to Anglican churches. They finally achieved the end of religious tests for university degrees in 1905. Gladstone brought the majority of Dissenters around to support for Home Rule for Ireland, putting the dissenting Protestants in league with the Irish Roman Catholics in an otherwise unlikely alliance. The Dissenters gave significant support to moralistic issues, such as temperance and sabbath enforcement. The nonconformist conscience, as it was called, was repeatedly called upon by Gladstone for support for his moralistic foreign policy. In election after election, Protestant ministers rallied their congregations to the Liberal ticket. In Scotland, the Presbyterians played a similar role to the Nonconformist Methodists, Baptists and other groups in England and Wales.

By the 1820s, the different Nonconformists, including Wesleyan Methodists, Baptists, Congregationalists and Unitarians, had formed the Committee of Dissenting Deputies and agitated for repeal of the highly restrictive Test and Corporation Acts. These Acts excluded Nonconformists from holding civil or military office or attending Oxford or Cambridge, compelling them to set up their own Dissenting Academies privately. The Tories tended to be in favour of these Acts and so the Nonconformist cause was linked closely to the Whigs, who advocated civil and religious liberty. After the Test and Corporation Acts were repealed in 1828, all the Nonconformists elected to Parliament were Liberals. Nonconformists were angered by the Education Act 1902, which integrated Church of England denominational schools into the state system and provided for their support from taxes. John Clifford formed the National Passive Resistance Committee and by 1906 over 170 Nonconformists had gone to prison for refusing to pay school taxes. They included 60 Primitive Methodists, 48 Baptists, 40 Congregationalists and 15 Wesleyan Methodists.

The political strength of Dissent faded sharply after 1920 with the secularisation of British society in the 20th century. The rise of the Labour Party reduced the Liberal Party strongholds into the nonconformist and remote &quot;Celtic Fringe&quot;, where the party survived by an emphasis on localism and historic religious identity, thereby neutralising much of the class pressure on behalf of the Labour movement. Meanwhile, the Anglican Church was a bastion of strength for the Conservative Party. On the Irish issue, the Anglicans strongly supported unionism. Increasingly after 1850, the Roman Catholic element in England and Scotland was composed of recent emigrants from Ireland who largely voted for the Irish Parliamentary Party until its collapse in 1918.

<doc id="4484" wikidata="Q183231" url="?curid=4484" title="Bank of England">
<text>The Bank of England is the central bank of the United Kingdom and the model on which most modern central banks have been based. Established in 1694 to act as the English Government&#x27;s banker and debt manager, and still one of the bankers for the government of the United Kingdom, it is the world&#x27;s second oldest central bank.

The bank was privately owned by stockholders from its foundation in 1694 until it was nationalised in 1946 by the Attlee ministry. In 1998 it became an independent public organisation, wholly owned by the Treasury Solicitor on behalf of the government, with a mandate to support the economic policies of the government of the day, but independence in maintaining price stability. In the 21st century the bank took on increased responsibility for maintaining and monitoring financial stability in the UK, and it increasingly functions as a statutory regulator.

The bank&#x27;s headquarters have been in London&#x27;s main financial district, the City of London, since 1694, and on Threadneedle Street since 1734. It is sometimes known as &quot;The Old Lady of Threadneedle Street&quot;, a name taken from a satirical cartoon by James Gillray in 1797. The road junction outside is known as Bank Junction.

The bank, among other things, is custodian to the official gold reserves of the United Kingdom (and those of around 30 other countries). , the bank held around of gold, worth £141 billion. These estimates suggest that the vault could hold as much as 3% of the 171,300 tonnes of gold mined throughout human history.

==Functions==
According to its strapline, the bank&#x27;s core purpose is &#x27;promoting the good of the people of the United Kingdom by maintaining monetary and financial stability&#x27;. This is achieved in a variety of ways:

===Monetary stability===
Stable prices and secure forms of payment are the two main criteria for monetary stability.

====Stable prices====
Stable prices are maintained by seeking to ensure that price increases meet the Government&#x27;s inflation target. The bank aims to meet this target by adjusting the base interest rate (known as the bank rate), which is decided by the bank&#x27;s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). (The MPC has devolved responsibility for managing monetary policy; HM Treasury has reserve powers to give orders to the committee &quot;if they are required in the public interest and by extreme economic circumstances&quot;, but Parliament must endorse such orders within 28 days.)

As of 2024 the inflation target is 2%; if this target is missed the Governor is required to write an open letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer explaining the situation and proposing remedies. Other than setting the base interest rate, the main tool at the bank&#x27;s disposal in this regard is quantitative easing.

====Secure forms of payment====
The bank has a monopoly on the issue of banknotes in England and Wales and regulates the issuance of banknotes by commercial banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland. (Scottish and Northern Irish banks retain the right to issue their own banknotes, but they must be backed one-for-one with deposits at the bank, excepting a few million pounds representing the value of notes they had in circulation in 1845.)

In addition the bank supervises other payment systems, acting as a settlement agent and operating Real-time gross settlement systems including CHAPS. In 2024 the bank was settling around £500 billion worth of payments between banks each day.

===Financial stability===
Maintaining financial stability involves protecting the UK&#x27;s savers, investors and borrowers against threats to the financial system as a whole. Threats are detected by the bank&#x27;s surveillance and market intelligence functions, and dealt with through financial and other operations (both at home and abroad). The majority of these safeguards were put in place in after the 2007–2008 financial crisis:

====Regulation====
In 2011 the bank&#x27;s Prudential Regulation Authority was established to regulate and supervise all major banks, building societies, credit unions, insurers and investment firms in the UK (&#x27;microprudential regulation&#x27;). The bank also has a statutory supervisory role in relation to financial market infrastructures.

====Risk management====
At the same time, the bank&#x27;s Financial Policy Committee (FPC) was set up to identify and monitor risks in the financial system, and to take appropriate action where necessary (&#x27;macroprudential regulation&#x27;). The FPC publishes its findings (and actions taken) in a biannual Financial Stability Report.

====Banking services====
The bank provides wholesale banking services to the UK Government (and to over a hundred overseas central banks). It manages the UK&#x27;s Exchange Equalisation Account on behalf of HM Treasury and it maintains the government&#x27;s Consolidated Fund account. It also manages the country&#x27;s foreign exchange reserves and is custodian of the UK&#x27;s (and others&#x27;) gold reserves.

The bank also offers &#x27;liquidity support and other services to banks and other financial institutions&#x27;. Commercial banks customarily keep a sizeable proportion of their cash reserves on deposit at the Bank of England. These central bank reserves are used by the banks to settle payments with one another; (for this reason the Bank of England is sometimes called &#x27;the bankers&#x27; bank&#x27;). In exceptional circumstances, the Bank may act as the lender of last resort by extending credit when no other institution will.

As a regulator and central bank, the Bank of England has not offered consumer banking services for many years, but it still does manage some public-facing services (such as exchanging superseded bank notes). Until 2017, Bank staff were entitled to open current accounts directly with the Bank of England and were given the unique sort code of 10-00-00.

====Resolution====
Under the terms of the Banking Act 2009 the bank is the UK&#x27;s Resolution Authority for any bank or building society judged &#x27;too big to fail&#x27;; as such it is empowered to act in the event of a bank failure &#x27;to protect the UK&#x27;s vital financial services and financial stability&#x27;.

===Historic services and responsibilities===
Between 1715 and 1998, the Bank of England managed Government Stocks (which formed the bulk of the national debt): the bank was responsible for issuing stocks to stockholders, paying dividends and maintaining a register of transfers; however in 1998, following the decision to grant the bank operational independence, responsibility for government debt management was transferred to a new Debt Management Office, which also took over Exchequer cash management and responsibility for issuing Treasury bills from the bank in 2000. Computershare took over as the registrar for UK Government bonds (gilt-edged securities or &#x27;gilts&#x27;) from the bank at the end of 2004. The bank, however, continues to act as settlement agent for the Debt Management Office and custodian of its securities.

Ever since its foundation in 1694, the bank had provided a retail banking service for the Government; however in 2008 it decided to withdraw from offering these services, which are now provided by a range of other financial institutions and managed by the Government Banking Service.

Until 2016, the bank provided personal banking services as a privilege for employees. Previously, the bank had maintained private and commercial accounts for all sorts of customers, including individuals, small businesses and public organisations; but a change of policy following the First World War saw the bank increasingly withdraw from this type of business to focus more clearly on its central banking role.

==History==

===Founding===
During the Nine Years&#x27; War, the Royal Navy was defeated by the French Navy in the 1690 Battle of Beachy Head, causing consternation in the government of William III of England. The English government decided to rebuild the Royal Navy into a force that was capable of challenging the French on equal terms; however, their ability to do so was hampered both by a lack of available public funds and the government&#x27;s low credit. This lack of credit made it impossible for the English government to borrow the £1.5m that it wanted to use to expand the Royal Navy.

====Concept====

In 1691, William Paterson had proposed establishing a national bank as a means of bolstering public finances. As he later wrote in his pamphlet &quot;A Brief Account of the Intended Bank of England&quot; (1694): While his scheme was not immediately acted upon, it did provide the basis for the bank&#x27;s first Charter and the legislation which made its establishment possible.

Two other key figures in the bank&#x27;s creation were Charles Montagu, the Member of Parliament for Maldon, who played a crucial role in steering the proposals through Parliament (and was afterwards appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer); and Michael Godfrey, who helped persuade City financiers of its benefits (and was subsequently chosen to be the bank&#x27;s first Deputy Governor).

It has also been claimed (by W. R. Scott, among others) that William Phips played a timely, if incidental, role: his successful expedition to retrieve booty from a sunken Spanish galleon (the &quot;Nuestra Señora de la Concepción&quot;) helped create an ideal market for the bank&#x27;s foundation: flooding the market with bullion and creating an enthusiasm for joint-stock ventures.

====Legislation====

Paterson&#x27;s proposal required the Government to set up a fund from which interest would be paid to the subscribers. It was decided that this would be provided for by income from tonnage, and certain other shipping duties routinely levied by HM Exchequer; therefore Parliament approved the bank&#x27;s establishment by means of the Tonnage Act 1694 (&#x27;An Act for granting to theire Majesties severall Rates and Duties upon Tunnage of Shipps and Vessells and upon Beere Ale and other Liquors for secureing certaine Recompenses and Advantages in the said Act mentioned to such Persons as shall voluntarily advance the summe of Fifteen hundred thousand Pounds towards the carrying on the Warr against France&#x27;).

To induce subscription to the loan, the subscribers were to be incorporated by the name of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England. Public finances were in such dire condition at the time that the terms of the loan (as laid down in the Act of Parliament) were that it was to be serviced at a rate of 8% per annum; there was also a service charge of £4,000 per annum payable to the bank for the management of the loan.

The Act limited the subscribers&#x27; investment to a maximum of £10,000 each in the first instance, and £1,200,000 in total (it was envisaged that the Exchequer would raise the remaining £300,000 through other forms of borrowing).

====Incorporation====

The royal charter of the Bank of England was granted on 27 July 1694, three months after the passing of the Act.

In the end the £1.2 million was raised in 12 days; 1,268 people subscribed. Their holdings were known as Bank Stock (Bank Stock continued to be held in private ownership until 1946 when the Bank of England was nationalised). The majority of the original subscribers were of &#x27;the mercantile middle classes of London&#x27; (though tradesmen and artisans also subscribed). Most (more than two-thirds) contributed less than £1,000. As a proportion of the total amount raised, 25% came from &#x27;esquires&#x27;, 21% from merchants and 15% from titled aristocrats. Twelve per cent of the original subscribers were women. King William and Queen Mary (jointly) invested £10,000, the maximum permitted sum, as did a handful of others (including Sir John Houblon).

Investment in the navy duly took place. As a side effect, the huge industrial effort needed (including establishing ironworks to make more nails and advances in agriculture feeding the quadrupled strength of the navy) started to transform the economy. This helped the new Kingdom of Great Britain – England and Scotland were formally united in 1707 – to become powerful. The power of the navy made Britain the dominant world power in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.

====Governance====
The first Governor of the bank was John Houblon, and the first Deputy Governor Michael Godfrey. (330 years later, in 1994, the bank would issue a £50 note depicting Houblon to mark its tercentenary.)
Governance was vested in the Governor, his Deputy and a &#x27;Court&#x27; of 24 Directors (most of whom were merchant bankers recruited from the City); the Directors were elected annually by a &#x27;General Court&#x27; of all the Bank&#x27;s registered stockholders (collectively known as &#x27;the Proprietors&#x27;). The common seal of the Court of Directors, adopted on 30 July 1694, depicted &#x27;Britannia sitting and looking on a Bank of mony&#x27;; Britannia has been the bank&#x27;s emblem ever since. 

The Court appointed three senior officers who, alongside the Governor and Deputy Governor, were responsible for its day-to-day running of the bank: the Secretary and Sollicitor, the First Accomptant and the First Cashier. (Their successors, the Secretary, Chief Accountant and Chief Cashier, continued to head up the main divisions of the bank&#x27;s operations for the next 250 years: the Chief Cashier and the Chief Accountant had oversight of the &#x27;cash side&#x27; and the &#x27;stock side&#x27; of the bank, respectively, while the Secretary oversaw its internal administration.)

Besides these officers, the bank in 1694 was staffed by seventeen clerks and two doorkeepers.

====Premises====
The bank initially did not have its own building, first opening on 1 August 1694 in Mercers&#x27; Hall on Cheapside. This however was found to be too small and from 31 December 1694 the bank operated from Grocers&#x27; Hall (located then on Poultry), where it would remain for almost 40 years. (Houblon had served as Master of the Grocers&#x27; Company in 1690–1691.)

====Operation====
The Act of Parliament prohibited the bank from trading in goods or merchandise of any kind, though it was allowed to deal in gold and silver bullion, and in bills of exchange. Before very long, the bank was maximising its profits by issuing banknotes, taking deposits and lending on mortgages.

In its early days the bank made significant losses, not least by accepting clipped coins in exchange for its banknotes. The establishment of a Land Bank (by John Asgill and Nicholas Barbon) in 1695, and a currency shortage occasioned by the Great Recoinage of 1696, both threatened the bank&#x27;s position; but Parliament intervened, passing another Act that year, which authorised the bank to increase its capital to over £2.2 million through the enlarging of its stock by new subscriptions.

===18th century===

In 1700, the Hollow Sword Blade Company was purchased by a group of businessmen who wished to establish a competing English bank (in an action that would today be considered a &quot;back door listing&quot;). The Bank of England&#x27;s initial monopoly on English banking was due to expire in 1710. However, it was instead renewed, and the Sword Blade company failed to achieve its goal.

The idea and reality of the national debt came about at around this time, and this was also largely managed by the bank. Through the 1715 Ways and Means Act, Parliament authorised the bank to receive subscriptions for a government issue of 5% annuities, designed to raise £910,000; this marked the start of the bank&#x27;s role in managing Government Stocks, which were a means for people to invest in government debt (previously Government borrowing had been administered directly by the Exchequer). The bank was obliged by the Act to pay half-yearly dividends and to keep a book record of all transfers (as it was already accustomed to do with regard to its own Bank Stock).

The bank did not have a monopoly on lending to the government, however: the South Sea Company had been established in 1711, and in 1720 it too became responsible for part of the UK&#x27;s national debt, becoming a major competitor to the Bank of England. While the &quot;South Sea Bubble&quot; disaster soon ensued, the company continued managing part of the UK national debt until 1853. The East India Company too was a lender of choice for the government.

In 1734 there were ninety-six members of staff at the bank. The bank&#x27;s charter was renewed in 1742, and again in 1764. By the 1742 Act the bank became the only joint-stock company allowed to issue bank notes in the metropolis.

====Threadneedle Street====

The Bank of England moved to its current location, on the site of Sir John Houblon&#x27;s house and garden in Threadneedle Street (close by the church of St Christopher le Stocks), in 1734. (The estate had been purchased ten years earlier; Houblon had died in 1712, but his widow lived on in the house until her death in 1731, after which the house was demolished and work on the bank began.)

The newly built premises, designed by George Sampson, occupied a narrow plot (around wide) extending north from Threadneedle Street. The front building contained transfer offices on the first floor, beneath which was an entrance arch leading to a courtyard. Facing the entrance was the &#x27;main building&#x27; of the bank: a large Hall () in which bank notes were issued and exchanged, and where deposits and withdrawals could be made. (Sampson&#x27;s Great Hall, later known as the Pay Hall, remained &quot;in situ&quot; and in use until Herbert Baker&#x27;s comprehensive rebuilding in the late 1920s.) Beyond the Hall was a quadrangle of buildings enclosing a &#x27;spacious and commodious Court-yard&#x27; (later known as Bullion Court). On the south side of the quadrangle were the Court Room and Committee Room, on the north side was a large Accountants&#x27; Office; on either side were arcaded walkways, with rooms for the senior officers, while the upper floors contained offices and apartments. Beneath the quadrangle were the vaults (&#x27;that have very strong Walls and Iron Gates, for the Preservation of the Cash&#x27;); access to the courtyard was provided, by way of a passage leading to a &#x27;grand Gateway&#x27; on Bartholomew Lane, for the coaches and waggons &#x27;that come frequently loaded with Gold and Silver Bullion&#x27;. The pediment above the entrance to the main Hall was decorated with a carved &quot;alto relievo&quot; figure of Britannia (who had appeared on the common seal of the bank since 30 July 1694); the sculptor was Robert Taylor, who went on to be appointed Architect, in succession to Sampson, in 1764. Inside, the east end of the Hall was dominated by a large statue by John Cheere of King William III, lauded in an accompanying Latin inscription as the bank&#x27;s founder (&quot;conditor&quot;); at the opposite end, a large Venetian window looked out on St Christopher&#x27;s churchyard.

====Expansion====

In the second half of the 18th century the bank gradually acquired neighbouring plots of land to enable it to expand, and after 1765 new buildings began to be added by the bank&#x27;s newly appointed architect Robert Taylor. North-west of the Pay Hall, overlooking St Christopher&#x27;s churchyard to the south, Taylor built a suite of rooms for the Directors of the bank centred on a new (much larger) Court Room and Committee Room (When the bank was rebuilt in the 1920s-30s, these rooms were removed from their original ground-floor location and reconstructed on the first floor; they continue to be used for meetings of the bank&#x27;s Court of Directors and Monetary Policy Committee respectively.). East of the Pay Hall, Taylor built a suite of halls and offices dedicated to the management of stocks and dividends, which more or less doubled the size of the bank&#x27;s footprint (extending it as far as Bartholomew Lane). These rooms were centred on a large Rotunda, also known as the Brokers&#x27; Exchange, where dealing in Government Stock took place; around it were arranged four sizeable Transfer Offices, each corresponding with a different fund (as described in the 1820s: &#x27;In each office under the several letters of the alphabet, are arranged the books on which the names of all persons having property in the funds are registered, as well as the particulars of their respective interests&#x27;). All these offices were top-lit, to avoid the need for windows in the external walls.
In 1782 the church of St Christopher le Stocks was demolished, allowing the bank to expand westwards along Threadneedle Street. The new west wing was completed to Taylor&#x27;s design in 1786 (its frontage matching that of Taylor&#x27;s earlier east wing): it housed the Reduced Annuities Office, the Cheque Office and the Dividend Warrant Office (among others). Immediately to the north lay the former churchyard of St Christopher le Stocks, which was preserved within the complex of buildings as a garden (known as the &#x27;Garden Court&#x27;). North of Bullion Court, Taylor built a new four-storey Library, to house the bank&#x27;s expanding collection of archives.

====The Bank Picquet====
The church&#x27;s demolition had been prompted by the 1780 Gordon Riots, during which rioters reportedly climbed on the church to throw projectiles at the buildings of the bank. During the riots, in June 1780, the Lord Mayor of London petitioned the Secretary of State to send a military guard to protect the bank and the Mansion House. Thenceforward a nightly guard (the &#x27;Bank Picquet&#x27;) was provided by soldiers of the Household Brigade (a practice which continued until 1973). To house the guard Taylor built a barracks (accessed from a separate entrance on Princes Street) in the north-west corner of the site.

====John Soane&#x27;s rebuilding====

Sir Robert Taylor died in 1788 and in his place the bank appointed John Soane as Architect and Surveyor (he would remain in post until 1827). Under his direction, the bank was further expanded and partially rebuilt, bit by bit but to a cohesive plan. A survey of the buildings, undertaken at the start of his tenure, identified some problems, which were promptly remedied by Soane: for example in 1795 he rebuilt the Rotunda and two of the adjacent Transfer Offices (the Bank Stock Office and the Four Per Cent Office), replacing Taylor&#x27;s timber roofs, which were leaking, with more durable stonework. At the same time Soane was tasked with purchasing properties to the north-east, with compulsory purchase powers granted by the (33 Geo. 3. c. 15), so as to enable the bank to expand in that direction as far as Lothbury. Between 1794 and 1800 he designed a cohesive set of buildings within the new irregularly-shaped site: he reconfigured Bullion Court and provided a new entrance route for vehicles from the north, which was named Lothbury Court; to the west of this he built a new Chief Cashier&#x27;s office, and rooms for the Secretary and Chief Accountant; to the east he constructed a new Library block and added a fifth Transfer Office (the Consols Transfer Office) to the north of the other four.

====The Brokers&#x27; Exchange in the Bank====

In the late 18th and early 19th century, prior to the establishment of the London Stock Exchange, the Rotunda in the Bank of England was used as a trading floor &#x27;where stock-brokers, stock-jobbers, and other persons, meet for the purpose of transacting business in public funds&#x27;. Branching off from the Rotunda were &#x27;offices appropriated to the management of each particular stock&#x27; containing books listing every individual&#x27;s registered interest in the fund. The use of the Rotunda for trading ceased in 1838, but it continued to be used for the cashing of fundholders&#x27; dividend warrants.

====Conflicts and credit crises====

The credit crisis of 1772 has been described as the first modern banking crisis faced by the Bank of England. The whole City of London was in uproar when Alexander Fordyce was declared bankrupt. In August 1773, the Bank of England assisted the EIC with a loan. The strain upon the reserves of the Bank of England was not eased until towards the end of the year.

During the American War of Independence, business for the bank was so good that George Washington remained a shareholder throughout the period.

By the bank&#x27;s charter renewal in 1781, it was also the bankers&#x27; bank – keeping enough gold to pay its notes on demand until 26 February 1797 when war had so diminished gold reserves that – following an invasion scare caused by the Battle of Fishguard days earlier – the government prohibited the bank from paying out in gold by the passing of the bank Restriction Act 1797. This prohibition lasted until 1821.

In 1798, during the French Revolutionary Wars, a Corps of bank Volunteers was formed (of between 450 and 500 men) to defend the bank in the event of an invasion. It was disbanded in 1802, but promptly re-formed the following year at the start of the Napoleonic Wars. Its soldiers were trained, in the event of an invasion, to remove the gold and silver from the vaults to a remote location, along with the banknote printing presses and certain important records. An armoury was provided on site at Threadneedle Street for their arms and accoutrements. The Corps was finally disbanded in 1814.

===19th century===

At the start of the 19th century a plan was enacted by John Soane for the further extension of the bank&#x27;s premises, this time to the north-west (necessitating the rerouting of Princes Street, to form the new western boundary of the site). Much of the area of the new extension was taken up with steam-powered presses for the printing of banknotes (notes continued to be printed on site until the First World War, when the former St Luke&#x27;s Hospital was acquired and converted into the bank&#x27;s printing works). Soane continued in post until 1833; in the last years before his retirement he completed his rebuilding of Taylor&#x27;s east wing and reconfigured Sampson and Taylor&#x27;s street-facing façades to make the entire perimeter of the complex a coherent whole.

In 1811, an &#x27;ingeniously contrived clock&#x27; by Thwaites &amp; Co. was installed above the Pay Hall: as well as chiming the hours and quarters, it conveyed the time remotely (by means of brass rods extending a total of in length) to dials located in sixteen different offices around the site.
The &#x27;panic of 1825&#x27; highlighted risks inherent in the bank&#x27;s three-way split loyalties: to its stockholders, to the Government (and thereby to the public), and to its commercial banking customers. In 1825–26 the bank was able to avert a liquidity crisis when Nathan Mayer Rothschild succeeded in supplying it with gold; nevertheless, after the crisis, many country and provincial banks failed prompting numerous commercial bankruptcies. The passing of the Country Bankers Act 1826 allowed the bank to open provincial branches for the better distribution of its banknotes (at the time small country banks, some of which were significantly undercapitalised, issued their own notes); by the end of the following year eight Bank of England branches had been set up around the country.
The Bank Charter Act 1844 tied the issue of notes to the gold reserves and gave the Bank of England sole rights with regard to the issue of banknotes in England. Private banks that had previously had that right retained it, provided that their headquarters were outside London and that they deposited security against the notes that they issued; but they were offered inducements to relinquish this right. (The last private bank in England to issue its own notes was Thomas Fox&#x27;s Fox, Fowler and Company bank in Wellington, which rapidly expanded until it merged with Lloyds Bank in 1927. They remained legal tender until 1964. (There are nine notes left in circulation; one is housed at Tone Dale House, Wellington.))

The bank acted as lender of last resort for the first time in the panic of 1866.

===20th century===

Until 1931 Britain was on the gold standard, meaning the value of sterling was fixed by the price of gold. That year, the Bank of England had to take Britain off the gold standard due to the effects of Great Depression spreading to Europe.

====1913 attempted bombing====

A terrorist bombing was attempted outside the Bank of England building on 4 April 1913. A bomb was discovered smoking and ready to explode next to railings outside the building. The bomb had been planted as part of the suffragette bombing and arson campaign, in which the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union (WSPU) launched a series of politically motivated bombing and arson attacks nationwide as part of their campaign for women&#x27;s suffrage. The bomb was defused before it could detonate, in what was then one of the busiest public streets in the capital, which likely prevented many civilian casualties. The bomb had been planted the day after WSPU leader Emmeline Pankhurst was sentenced to three years&#x27; imprisonment for carrying out a bombing on the home of politician David Lloyd George.

The remains of the bomb, which was built into a milk churn, are now on display at the City of London Police Museum.

====Restructuring and rebuilding====
During the governorship of Montagu Norman, from 1920 to 1944, the bank made deliberate efforts to move away from commercial banking and become a central bank. A later Governor, Robin Leigh-Pemberton, described it as &#x27;a time of rapid change, in which we began to move away from the clerical traditions of 200 years [...] and to accept specialisation, mechanisation and modern management disciplines&#x27;. Economists and statisticians began to be employed at the bank in increasing number. In 1931 the &#x27;Peacock Committee&#x27;, set up to advise on organisational improvements, published recommendations which included the appointment of paid executive Directors (alongside the traditional non-executive members of the Court). It also recommended reconfiguration of the bank&#x27;s traditional departmental structures.
The work of the bank had significantly increased since the end of the First World War, and the decision was taken to expand. Between 1925 and 1939 the bank&#x27;s headquarters on Threadneedle Street were comprehensively rebuilt by Herbert Baker. (This involved the demolition of most of Sir John Soane&#x27;s buildings, an act described by architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner as &quot;the greatest architectural crime, in the City of London, of the twentieth century&quot;.) Initially the plan had been to retain Soane&#x27;s banking halls behind the curtain wall, but this proved challenging so they were instead demolished and rebuilt in facsimile. The demolition and rebuilding took place in stages, with staff moving from one part of the building to another (or, in some cases, into temporary accommodation at Finsbury Circus). The bullion and securities remained on site throughout. During reconstruction human remains pertaining to the old churchyard of St Christopher le Stocks were exhumed and reburied at Nunhead Cemetery.
Baker&#x27;s steel-framed building stands seven storeys high, with a further three vault storeys extending below ground level. It is decorated with sculpture and bronze work by Charles Wheeler, plasterwork by Joseph Armitage and mosaics by Boris Anrep. The bank today is a Grade I listed building.

1939 saw the introduction of Exchange Controls in the United Kingdom at the outbreak of the Second World War; these were administered by the bank. During WWII, over 10% of the face value of circulating Pound Sterling banknotes were forgeries produced by Germany.

A number of the bank&#x27;s operations and staff were relocated to Hampshire for the duration of the war, including the printing works (which moved to Overton), the Accountant&#x27;s Department (which went to Hurstbourne Park) and various other offices. Those who remained at Threadneedle Street, including the Directors, moved their offices into the underground vaults.

====Post-war nationalisation====
In 1946, shortly after the end of Montagu Norman&#x27;s tenure, the bank was nationalised by the Labour government. At the same time the number of Directors was reduced to sixteen (four of whom were full-time Executive Directors).

The bank pursued the multiple goals of Keynesian economics after 1945, especially &quot;easy money&quot; and low-interest rates to support aggregate demand. It tried to keep a fixed exchange rate and attempted to deal with inflation and sterling weakness by credit and exchange controls.
After the war, the very large Accountant&#x27;s Department (which managed the stock side of the bank) moved back to London from Hampshire. Its designated office-space at Threadneedle Street, however, had in the meantime been taken over by the Exchange Control office. The department was instead provided with temporary accommodation (once more in Finsbury Circus), pending construction of a new building, which would occupy a two-acre bombsite immediately to the east of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. &#x27;Bank of England New Change&#x27; was designed by Victor Heal and opened in 1957 (at the time it was London&#x27;s biggest post-war rebuilding project); the new building contained several staff amenities alongside the office accommodation and, at street level, retail units were let to an assortment of businesses. The bank had the building on a 200-year lease; but with the advent of computerisation staff numbers were drastically reduced in the 1980s-90s; parts of the building were let to other firms (most notably the law firm Allen &amp; Overy). The bank sold the building in 2000 and in 2007 it was demolished; One New Change now stands on the site.

The bank&#x27;s &quot;10 bob note&quot; was withdrawn from circulation in 1970 in preparation for Decimal Day in 1971.
In 1977 the bank set up a wholly owned subsidiary called Bank of England Nominees Limited (BOEN), a now-defunct private limited company, with two of its hundred £1 shares issued. According to its memorandum of association, its objectives were: &quot;To act as Nominee or agent or attorney either solely or jointly with others, for any person or persons, partnership, company, corporation, government, state, organisation, sovereign, province, authority, or public body, or any group or association of them&quot;. Bank of England Nominees Limited was granted an exemption by Edmund Dell, Secretary of State for Trade, from the disclosure requirements under Section 27(9) of the Companies Act 1976, because &quot;it was considered undesirable that the disclosure requirements should apply to certain categories of shareholders&quot;. The Bank of England is also protected by its royal charter status and the Official Secrets Act. BOEN was a vehicle for governments and heads of state to invest in UK companies (subject to approval from the Secretary of State), providing they undertake &quot;not to influence the affairs of the company&quot;. In its later years, BOEN was no longer exempt from company law disclosure requirements. Although a dormant company, dormancy does not preclude a company actively operating as a nominee shareholder. BOEN had two shareholders: the Bank of England, and the Secretary of the Bank of England.

The reserve requirement for banks to hold a minimum fixed proportion of their deposits as reserves at the Bank of England was abolished in 1981: see for more details. The contemporary transition from Keynesian economics to Chicago economics was analysed by Nicholas Kaldor in &quot;The Scourge of Monetarism&quot;.

The handing over of monetary policy to the bank became a key plank of the Liberal Democrats&#x27; economic policy for the 1992 general election. Conservative MP Nicholas Budgen had also proposed this as a private member&#x27;s bill in 1996, but the bill failed as it had the support of neither the government nor the opposition.

The UK government left the expensive-to-maintain European Exchange Rate Mechanism in September 1992, in an action that cost HM Treasury over £3 billion. This led to closer communication between the government and the bank.
In 1993, the bank produced its first &quot;Inflation Report&quot; for the government, detailing inflationary trends and pressures. This annually produced report remains one of the bank&#x27;s major publications. The success of inflation targeting in the United Kingdom has been attributed to the bank&#x27;s focus on transparency. The Bank of England has been a leader in producing innovative ways of communicating information to the public, especially through its Inflation Report, which many other central banks have emulated.

The bank celebrated its three-hundredth birthday in 1994.

In 1996, the bank produced its first &quot;Financial Stability Review&quot;. This annual publication became known as the &quot;Financial Stability Report&quot; in 2006. Also that year, the bank set up its real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system to improve risk-free settlement between UK banks.

On 6 May 1997, following the 1997 general election that brought a Labour government to power for the first time since 1979, it was announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, that the bank would be granted operational independence over monetary policy. Under the terms of the Bank of England Act 1998 (which came into force on 1 June 1998) the bank&#x27;s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) was given sole responsibility for setting interest rates to meet the Government&#x27;s Retail Prices Index (RPI) inflation target of 2.5%. The target has changed to 2% since the Consumer Price Index (CPI) replaced the Retail Prices Index as the Treasury&#x27;s inflation index. If inflation overshoots or undershoots the target by more than 1% the Governor has to write a letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer explaining why, and how he will remedy the situation.

Independent central banks that adopt an inflation target are known as Friedmanite central banks. This change in Labour&#x27;s politics was described by Skidelsky in &quot;The Return of the Master&quot; as a mistake and as an adoption of the rational expectations hypothesis as promulgated by Alan Walters. Inflation targets combined with central bank independence have been characterised as a &quot;starve the beast&quot; strategy creating a lack of money in the public sector.

in June 1998 responsibility for the regulation and supervision of the banking and insurance industries was transferred from the bank to the Financial Services Authority. A memorandum of understanding described the terms under which the bank, the Treasury, and the FSA would work toward the common aim of increased financial stability. (Ten years later, however, after the 2007–2008 financial crisis, new banking legislation transferred the responsibility for regulation and supervision of the banking and insurance industries back to the Bank of England).

===21st century===

The bank decided to sell its banknote-printing operations to De La Rue in December 2002, under the advice of Close Brothers Corporate Finance Ltd.

Mervyn King became the Governor of the Bank of England on 30 June 2003.

In 2009, a request made to HM Treasury under the Freedom of Information Act sought details about the 3% Bank of England stock owned by unnamed shareholders whose identity the bank is not at liberty to disclose. In a letter of reply dated 15 October 2009, HM Treasury explained that &quot;Some of the 3% Treasury stock which was used to compensate former owners of bank stock has not been redeemed. However, interest is paid out twice a year and it is not the case that this has been accumulating and compounding.&quot;
In 2010, the incoming Chancellor announced his intention to merge the Financial Services Authority back into the bank. In 2011 an interim Financial Policy Committee (FPC) was created (as a mirror committee to the Monetary Policy Committee) to spearhead the bank&#x27;s new mandate on financial stability. The Financial Services Act 2012 gave the bank additional functions and bodies, including an independent FPC, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), and more powers to supervise financial market infrastructure providers. It also created the independent Financial Conduct Authority. These bodies are responsible for macroprudential regulation of all UK banks and insurance companies.

Canadian Mark Carney assumed the post of Governor of the Bank of England on 1 July 2013. He served an initial five-year term rather than the typical eight. He became the first Governor not to be a United Kingdom citizen but has since been granted citizenship. At Government request, his term was extended to 2019, then again to 2020. , the bank also had four Deputy Governors.

BOEN was dissolved, following liquidation, in July 2017.

Andrew Bailey succeeded Carney as the Governor of the Bank of England on 16 March 2020.

===Asset purchase facility ===
The bank has operated, since January 2009, an Asset Purchase Facility (APF) to buy &quot;high-quality assets financed by the issue of Treasury bills and the DMO&#x27;s cash management operations&quot; and thereby improve liquidity in the credit markets. It has, since March 2009, also provided the mechanism by which the bank&#x27;s policy of quantitative easing (QE) is achieved, under the auspices of the MPC. Along with managing the QE funds, which were £895 bn at peak, the APF continues to operate its corporate facilities. Both are undertaken by a subsidiary company of the Bank of England, the Bank of England Asset Purchase Facility Fund Limited (BEAPFF).

QE was primarily designed as an instrument of monetary policy. The mechanism required the Bank of England to purchase government bonds on the secondary market, financed by creating new central bank money. This would have the effect of increasing the asset prices of the bonds purchased, thereby lowering yields and dampening longer-term interest rates. The policy&#x27;s aim was initially to ease liquidity constraints in the sterling reserves system but evolved into a wider policy to provide economic stimulus.

QE was enacted in six tranches between 2009 and 2020. At its peak in 2020, the portfolio totalled £895 billion, comprising £875 billion of UK government bonds and £20 billion of high-grade commercial bonds.

In February 2022, the Bank of England announced its intention to commence winding down the QE portfolio. Initially this would be achieved by not replacing tranches of maturing bonds, and would later be accelerated through active bond sales.

In August 2022, the Bank of England reiterated its intention to accelerate the QE wind-down through active bond sales. This policy was affirmed in an exchange of letters between the Bank of England and the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer in September 2022. Between February 2022 and September 2022, a total of £37.1bn of government bonds matured, reducing the outstanding stock from £875.0bn at the end of 2021 to £837.9bn. In addition, a total of £1.1bn of corporate bonds matured, reducing the stock from £20.0bn to £18.9bn, with sales of the remaining stock planned to begin on 27 September.

==Banknote issues==
The bank has issued banknotes since 1694. Notes were originally hand-written; although they were partially printed from 1725 onwards, cashiers still had to sign each note and make them payable to someone. Notes were fully printed from 1855. Until 1928 all notes were &quot;White Notes&quot;, printed in black and with a blank reverse. In the 18th and 19th centuries, White Notes were issued in £1 and £2 denominations. During the 20th century, White Notes were issued in denominations between £5 and £1000. Until the passing of the Gold Standard Act 1925 the bank was obliged to pay on demand the value of the note in gold coin to its bearer.

In 1724 the bank entered into a contract with Henry Portal of Whitchurch, Hampshire to provide high-quality paper for the printing of banknotes. The printing itself was undertaken by private printing firms; the copper plates were kept in the vault, and accompanied during their time at the printer by a bank clerk (who would record the number of copies made); once dry they would be delivered to the bank. The printing operation was brought within the bank&#x27;s premises (albeit still under private contract) in 1791; in 1808 it was brought fully in-house.
Until the mid-19th century, commercial banks were allowed to issue their own banknotes, and notes issued by provincial banking companies were commonly in circulation. The Bank Charter Act 1844 began the process of restricting note issue to the bank; new banks were prohibited from issuing their own banknotes, and existing note-issuing banks were not permitted to expand their issue. As provincial banking companies merged to form larger banks, they lost their right to issue notes, and the English private banknote eventually disappeared, leaving the bank with a monopoly of note issues in England and Wales. The last private bank to issue its own banknotes in England and Wales was Fox, Fowler and Company in 1921. However, the limitations of the 1844 Act only affected banks in England and Wales, and today three commercial banks in Scotland and four in Northern Ireland continue to issue their own banknotes, regulated by the bank.
At the start of the First World War, the Currency and Bank Notes Act 1914 was passed, which granted temporary powers to HM Treasury for issuing banknotes to the values of £1 and 10/- (ten shillings). Treasury notes had full legal tender status and were not convertible into gold through the bank; they replaced the gold coin in circulation to prevent a run on sterling and to enable raw material purchases for armament production. These notes featured an image of King George V (Bank of England notes did not begin to display an image of the monarch until 1960). The wording on each note was:

Treasury notes were issued until 1928 when the Currency and Bank Notes Act 1928 returned note-issuing powers to the banks. The Bank of England issued notes for ten shillings and one pound for the first time on 22 November 1928.
During the Second World War, the German Operation Bernhard attempted to counterfeit denominations between £5 and £50, producing 500,000 notes each month in 1943. The original plan was to parachute the money into the UK in an attempt to destabilise the British economy, but it was found more useful to use the notes to pay German agents operating throughout Europe. Although most fell into Allied hands at the end of the war, forgeries frequently appeared for years afterward, which led banknote denominations above £5 to be removed from circulation.

In 2006, over £53 million in banknotes belonging to the bank was stolen from a depot in Tonbridge, Kent.

In 1917 the bank had moved its printing operation into St Luke&#x27;s Printing Works, a former hospital; in 1958 it moved out to Debden. Modern banknotes are printed by contract with De La Rue Currency in Loughton, Essex.

==Branch offices==

For most of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries the bank had a number of branches in London and other English cities.

The first branches opened in 1826 (with impetus provided by the passing of the Country Bankers Act, which for the first time permitted the establishment of joint-stock banks outside London). The bank envisaged that the new network of branches would &#x27;increase the circulation of Bank Notes, give the bank much more complete control over the whole paper circulation, and protect the bank against the competition of larger banking Companies&#x27;. Each branch was overseen by an Agent (a person of &#x27;commercial knowledge, with local experience&#x27;). By 1829 there were eleven branches operating (ten in England and one in Wales). Some of the less profitable branches were relatively short-lived, but others continued operating into the 1990s.

In 1997 the five last remaining branches closed; the Agents, however, were retained, with a structure of Regional Agencies created (across the UK), some of which were based in former branch buildings.

===List of Bank of England branches===
==Governance of the Bank of England==

===Governors===

Following is a list of the governors of the Bank of England since the beginning of the 20th century:

===Court of Directors===
The Court of Directors is a unitary board that is responsible for setting the organisation&#x27;s strategy and budget and making key decisions on resourcing and appointments. It consists of five executive members from the bank (the Governor and the four Deputy Governors, each of whom oversees a different area of the bank&#x27;s work), plus up to 9 non-executive members, all of whom are appointed by the Crown. The Chancellor selects the Chairman of the Court from among the non-executive members. The Court is required to meet at least seven times a year.

The Governor serves for a period of eight years, the Deputy Governors for five years, and the non-executive members for up to four years.

===Other staff===
The Secretary of the Bank of England is today responsible for the banks governance and ethics: &#x27;He is responsible for ensuring the organisation is well run and advises our Court of Directors [...] He is also our conflicts officer and supports the Government when it makes appointments to our policy committees and Court of Directors&#x27;.

Since 2013, the bank has had a chief operating officer (COO) with the status and remuneration of a Deputy Governor. , the bank&#x27;s COO is Ben Stimson; he is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the bank, including Human Resources, Property, IT and Security.

Some twenty executive directors work alongside the Governors, forming &#x27;the wider executive management team&#x27;. Among their number are the bank&#x27;s chief economist (Huw Pill since 2021), and chief cashier.
