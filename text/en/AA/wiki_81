<text>William John Clifton Haley (; July 6, 1925 – February 9, 1981) was an American rock and roll musician. He is credited by many with first popularizing this form of music in the early 1950s with his group Bill Haley &amp; His Comets and million-selling hits such as &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;, &quot;See You Later, Alligator&quot;, &quot;Shake, Rattle and Roll&quot;, &quot;Rocket 88&quot;, &quot;Skinny Minnie&quot;, and &quot;Razzle Dazzle&quot;. Haley has sold over 60 million records worldwide. In 1987, he was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Haley was born July 6, 1925, in Highland Park, Michigan. In 1929, the four-year-old Haley underwent an inner-ear mastoid operation which accidentally severed an optic nerve, leaving him blind in his left eye for the rest of his life. It is said that he adopted his trademark kiss curl over his right eye to draw attention from his left, but it also became his &quot;gimmick&quot;, and added to his popularity. As a result of the effects of the Great Depression on the Detroit area, his father moved the family to Bethel Township, Pennsylvania, when Bill was seven years old. Haley&#x27;s father William Albert Haley (1900–1956) was from Kentucky and played the banjo and mandolin, and his mother, Maude Green (1895–1955), who was originally from Ulverston in Lancashire, England, was a technically accomplished keyboardist with classical training. Haley told the story that when he made a simulated guitar out of cardboard, his parents bought him a real one.

One of his first appearances was in 1938 for a Bethel Junior baseball team entertainment event, performing guitar and songs when he was 13 years old.

The anonymous sleeve notes accompanying the 1956 Decca album &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; describe Haley&#x27;s early life and career: &quot;When Bill Haley was fifteen [c. 1940] he left home with his guitar and very little else and set out on the hard road to fame and fortune. The next few years, continuing this story in a fairy-tale manner, were hard and poverty-stricken, but crammed full of useful experience. Apart from learning how to exist on one meal a day and other artistic exercises, he worked at an open-air park show, sang and yodelled with any band that would have him, and worked with a traveling medicine show. Eventually he got a job with a popular group known as the &#x27;Down Homers&#x27; while they were in Hartford, Connecticut. Soon after this he decided, as all successful people must decide at some time or another, to be his own boss again – and he has been that ever since.&quot; These notes fail to account for his early band, known as the Four Aces of Western Swing. During the 1940s Haley was considered one of the top cowboy yodelers in America as &quot;Silver Yodeling Bill Haley&quot;. One source states that Haley started his career as &quot;The Rambling Yodeler&quot; in a country band, The Saddlemen.

The sleeve notes conclude: &quot;For six years Bill Haley was a musical director of Radio Station WPWA in Chester, Pennsylvania, and led his own band all through this period. It was then known as Bill Haley&#x27;s Saddlemen, indicating their definite leaning toward the tough Western style. They continued playing in clubs as well as over the radio around Philadelphia, and in 1951 made their first recordings on Ed Wilson&#x27;s Keystone Records in Philadelphia.&quot; The group subsequently signed with Dave Miller&#x27;s Holiday Records and, on June 14, 1951, the Saddlemen recorded a cover of the Delta Cats &quot;Rocket 88&quot;.

===Bill Haley and His Comets===
During the Labor Day weekend in 1952, the Saddlemen were renamed Bill Haley with Haley&#x27;s Comets. The name was inspired by the supposedly official pronunciation of Halley&#x27;s Comet and was suggested by Bob Johnson, program director at radio station WPWA where Bill Haley had a live radio program from 12:00noon to 1:00p.m. In 1953, Haley&#x27;s recording of &quot;Crazy Man, Crazy&quot; (co-written by Haley and his bass player, Marshall Lytle, although Lytle would not receive credit until 2001) hit the American charts, peaking at number 12 on &quot;Billboard&quot; and number 11 on &quot;Cash Box&quot;. Some sources indicate that this was the first rock and roll record in history, although rockabilly might be a more appropriate term. By the time this record was released, the group&#x27;s name had been revised to using the term &quot;Comets&quot; instead of &quot;Saddlemen&quot;.

In 1954, Haley recorded &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;. Initially, it was only a moderate success, peaking at number 36 on the &quot;Cash Box&quot; pop singles chart and staying on the charts for just two weeks. On re-release, the record reached number one on July 9, 1955.

Haley had already had a worldwide hit with &quot;Shake, Rattle and Roll&quot;, another rhythm and blues cover in this case from Big Joe Turner, which went on to sell a million copies and was the first rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll song to enter the UK Singles Chart in December 1954, becoming a gold record. He retained elements of the original (which was slow blues), but sped it up with some country music aspects into the song (specifically, Western swing) and changed up the lyrics. Haley and his band were important in launching the music known as &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; to a wider audience after a period of it being considered an underground genre.

When &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; appeared as the theme song of the 1955 film &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot; starring Glenn Ford, it soared to the top of the American &quot;Billboard&quot; chart for eight weeks. The single is commonly used as a convenient line of demarcation between the &quot;rock era&quot; and the music industry that preceded it. &quot;Billboard&quot; separated its statistical tabulations into 1890–1954 and 1955–present. After the record rose to number one, Haley became widely popular with those who had come to embrace the new style of music. With the song&#x27;s success, the age of rock music began overnight and ended the dominance of the jazz and pop standards performed by Frank Sinatra, Jo Stafford, Perry Como, Bing Crosby, Eddie Fisher, and Patti Page. &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; was also the first record to sell over one million copies in both Britain and Germany. Danny Cedrone, not a member of The Comets, played the guitar solo on the record, though did not live long enough to see the song&#x27;s success as he died shortly after the recording following a fall down stairs at his home, aged 33.

Bill Haley and the Comets performed &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; on the &quot;Texaco Star Theater&quot; hosted by Milton Berle on May 31, 1955, on NBC in an&quot; a cappella&quot; and lip-synched version. Berle predicted that the song would go number one: &quot;A group of entertainers who are going right to the top.&quot; Berle also sang and danced to the song which was performed by the entire cast of the show. This was one of the earliest nationally televised performances by a rock and roll band and provided the new musical genre with a much wider audience.

Bill Haley and the Comets were the first rock and roll act to appear on American musical variety series the &quot;Ed Sullivan Show&quot; on August 7, 1955, on CBS in a broadcast that originated from the Shakespeare Festival Theater in Stratford, Connecticut. They performed a live version of &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; with Franny Beecher on lead guitar and Dick Richards on drums. The band made their second appearance on the show on Sunday, April 28, 1957, performing the songs &quot;Rudy&#x27;s Rock&quot; and &quot;Forty Cups of Coffee&quot;.

Later on in 1957, Haley became the first major American rock singer to tour Europe. Haley continued to score hits throughout the 1950s such as &quot;See You Later, Alligator&quot; and he starred in the first rock and roll musical films &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Knock the Rock&quot;, both in 1956. Haley was already 30 years old, and his popularity was soon eclipsed in the United States by the younger Elvis Presley, but continued to enjoy great popularity in Latin America, Europe, and Australia during the 1960s.

Bill Haley and the Comets appeared on &quot;American Bandstand&quot; hosted by Dick Clark on ABC twice in 1957, on the prime time show October 28, 1957, and on the regular daytime show on November 27, 1957. The band also appeared on Dick Clark&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Beechnut Show&quot;, also known as &quot;The Dick Clark Show&quot;, a primetime TV series from New York on March 22, 1958, during the first season and on February 20, 1960, performing &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;; &quot;Shake, Rattle and Roll&quot;; and &quot;Tamiami&quot;.

=== Personal life ===
====Marriages====
Haley was married at least three times:
* Dorothy Crowe (December 11, 1946 – November 14, 1952) (divorced, two children)
* Barbara Joan Cupchak (November 18, 1952 – 1960) (divorced, five children)
* Martha Valaesco (1963 – February 9, 1981)

====Children====
Haley had at least ten children. John W. Haley, his eldest son, wrote &quot;Sound and Glory&quot;, a biography of Haley. His youngest daughter, Gina Haley, is a professional musician based in Texas. Scott Haley is an athlete. His youngest son Pedro is also a musician.

He also had a daughter, Martha Maria, from his marriage with Martha Velasco.

Bill Haley Jr., Haley&#x27;s second son and first with Joan Barbara &quot;Cuppy&quot; Haley-Hahn, publishes a regional business magazine. In 2011, he formed a tribute band, performing his father&#x27;s music and telling the stories behind the songs.

==Last years and death==
Haley failed to achieve the level of success enjoyed by contemporaries such as Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis. According to one source, &quot;he had conflicted feelings about fame, was extremely private, suffered chronic alcoholism, and troubled relationships&quot;. Having admitted to an alcohol problem in a 1974 radio interview for the BBC, Haley continued to battle alcoholism into the 1970s. Nonetheless, he and his band continued to be a popular touring act, benefiting from a 1950s nostalgia movement that began in the late 1960s and the signing of a lucrative record deal with the European Sonet label. After performing for Queen Elizabeth II at the Royal Variety Performance on November 26, 1979, Haley made his final performances in South Africa in May and June 1980. Just before the South African tour commenced, Haley was diagnosed with a brain tumor, and a planned tour of Germany in the autumn of 1980 was subsequently cancelled.

Despite his illness, Haley started compiling notes for possible use as a basis for either a biographical film based on his life, or a published autobiography (accounts differ), and there were plans for him to record an album in Memphis, Tennessee, when the brain tumor began affecting his behavior and he returned to his home in Harlingen, Texas.

The October 25, 1980, issue of German tabloid &quot;Bild&quot; reported that Haley had a brain tumor. Haley&#x27;s British manager, Patrick Malynn, was quoted as saying that &quot;Haley had taken a fit [and] didn&#x27;t recognize anyone anymore.&quot; In addition, a doctor who examined Haley said that the tumor was inoperable.

Haley&#x27;s widow Martha, who was with him in these troubling times, denied he had a brain tumor, as did his close friend Hugh McCallum. Martha and friends related that Haley did not want to go on the road anymore and that ticket sales for that planned tour of Germany in the fall of 1980 were slow. McCallum said, &quot;It&#x27;s my unproven gut feeling that that [the brain tumor] was said to curtail talks about the tour and play the sympathy card.&quot;

At the same time, Haley&#x27;s alcoholism appeared to be worsening. According to Martha, by this time, she and Haley fought all the time and she told him to stop drinking or move out. Eventually, he moved into a room in their pool house. Martha still took care of him and sometimes, he would come in the house to eat, but he ate very little. &quot;There were days we never saw him,&quot; said his daughter Martha Maria. In addition to Haley&#x27;s drinking problems, it was becoming evident that he was also developing serious mental health issues. Martha Maria said, &quot;It was like sometimes he was drunk even when he wasn&#x27;t drinking.&quot; After being picked up by the police in Harlingen several times for alleged intoxication, Martha had a judge put Haley in the hospital, where he was seen by a psychiatrist, who said Haley&#x27;s brain was overproducing a chemical, like adrenaline. The doctor prescribed a medication to stop the overproduction, but said Haley would have to stop drinking. Martha said, &quot;This is pointless.&quot; She took him home, however, fed him and gave him his first dose. As soon as he felt better, he went back out to his room in the pool house, and the downward spiral continued until his death.

Media reports immediately following his death indicated that Haley displayed deranged and erratic behavior in the final weeks of his life. According to a biography of Haley by John Swenson, released in 1982, Haley made a succession of bizarre, mostly monologue late-night phone calls to friends and relatives toward the end of his life in which he was semi-coherent. His first wife has been quoted as saying, &quot;He would call you and ramble, dwelling on the past...&quot; The biography also describes Haley painting the windows of his home black, but there is little other information available about his final days.

Haley died at his home in Harlingen on February9, 1981, aged 55. He was discovered lying motionless on his bed by a friend who had stopped by to visit him. The friend immediately called the police and Haley was pronounced dead at the scene. Haley&#x27;s death certificate gave &quot;natural causes, most likely a heart attack&quot; as being the cause. Following a small funeral service attended by 75 people, Haley was cremated in Brownsville, Texas.

==Tributes and legacy==
Haley received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6350 Hollywood Boulevard on February8, 1960, for his contributions to the music industry. Haley was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987. His son Pedro represented him at the ceremony. The Comets were separately inducted into the Hall of Fame as a group in 2012, after a rule change allowed the induction of backing groups.

Songwriters Tom Russell and Dave Alvin addressed Haley&#x27;s demise in musical terms with &quot;Haley&#x27;s Comet&quot; on Alvin&#x27;s 1991 album &quot;Blue Blvd.&quot; Dwight Yoakam sang backup on the tribute.

Surviving members of the 1954–55 contingent of Haley&#x27;s Comets reunited in the late 1980s and continued to perform for many years around the world. They released a concert DVD in 2004 on Hydra Records, played the Viper Room in West Hollywood in 2005, and performed at Dick Clark&#x27;s American Bandstand Theater in Branson, Missouri, beginning in 2006–07. As of 2014, only two members of this particular contingent were still alive (Joey Ambrose and Dick Richards), but they continued to perform in Branson and Europe. In 2019, Dick Richards, the drummer of the Comets, died at the age of 95. As of 2014, at least two other groups continue to perform in North America under the Comets name.

In March 2007, the Original Comets opened the Bill Haley Museum in Munich, Germany. On October 27, 2007, ex-Comets guitar player Bill Turner opened the Bill Haley Museum for the public.

=== Asteroid ===

In February 2006, the International Astronomical Union announced the naming of asteroid 79896 Billhaley to mark the 25th anniversary of Haley&#x27;s death.

==Published biographies==
* In 1980, Haley began working on an autobiography entitled &quot;The Life and Times of Bill Haley&quot;, but died after completing only 100 pages. The work is registered with the U.S. Copyright Office, but has yet to be released to the public. According to Gina Haley, Bill&#x27;s youngest daughter, her father managed to complete the book on his career, and the manuscript is in possession of the Bill Haley estate.

==Film portrayals==

Unlike his contemporaries, Haley has rarely been portrayed on screen. Following the success of &quot;The Buddy Holly Story&quot; in 1978, Haley expressed interest in having his life story committed to film, but this never came to fruition. In the 1980s and early 1990s, numerous media reports emerged stating that plans were underway to do a biopic based upon Haley&#x27;s life, with Beau Bridges, Jeff Bridges and John Ritter all at one point being mentioned as actors in line to play Haley (according to &quot;Goldmine Magazine&quot;, Ritter attempted to buy the film rights to &quot;Sound and Glory&quot;).

Haley has been portrayed by:
* John Paramor in &quot;Shout! The Story of Johnny O&#x27;Keefe&quot; (1985)
* Michael Daingerfield in &quot;Mr. Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll: The Alan Freed Story&quot; (1999)
* Dicky Barrett in &quot;Shake, Rattle and Roll: An American Love Story&quot; (1999)

==Discography==

Before the formation of Bill Haley and the Saddlemen, which later became the Comets, Haley released several singles with other groups. Dates are approximate due to lack of documentation.

As Bill Haley and the Four Aces of Western Swing:

1948
* &quot;Too Many Parties and Too Many Pals&quot; (vocal by Tex King)/&quot;Four Leaf Clover Blues&quot; (Cowboy CR1201) August 1948 
1949
* &quot;Tennessee Border/Candy Kisses&quot; (Cowboy CR1202) March 1949 

As Johnny Clifton and His String Band:

1950
* &quot;Stand Up and Be Counted/Loveless Blues&quot; (Center C102)

Many Haley discographies list two 1946 recordings by the Down Homers released on the Vogue Records label as featuring Haley. Haley historian Chris Gardner, as well as surviving members of the group, have confirmed that the two singles: &quot;Out Where the West Winds Blow&quot;/&quot;Who&#x27;s Gonna Kiss You When I&#x27;m Gone&quot; (Vogue R736) and &quot;Boogie Woogie Yodel&quot;/&quot;Baby I Found Out All About You&quot; (Vogue R786) do not feature Haley. However, the tracks were nonetheless included in the compilation box set &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Arrives&quot; released by Bear Family Records in 2006.

==Compositions==
Haley&#x27;s compositions included &quot;Four Leaf Clover Blues&quot; in 1948; &quot;Rose of My Heart&quot;; &quot;Yodel Your Blues Away&quot;; &quot;Crazy Man, Crazy&quot;; &quot;What&#x27;Cha Gonna Do&quot;; &quot;Fractured&quot;; &quot;Live It Up&quot;; &quot;Farewell, So Long, Goodbye&quot;; &quot;Real Rock Drive&quot;; &quot;Rocking Chair on the Moon&quot;; &quot;Sundown Boogie&quot;; &quot;Green Tree Boogie&quot;; &quot;Tearstains on My Heart&quot;; &quot;Down Deep in My Heart&quot;; &quot;Straight Jacket&quot;; &quot;Birth of the Boogie&quot;; &quot;Two Hound Dogs&quot;; &quot;Rock-A-Beatin&#x27; Boogie&quot;; &quot;Hot Dog Buddy Buddy&quot;; &quot;R-O-C-K&quot;; &quot;Rudy&#x27;s Rock&quot;; &quot;Calling All Comets&quot;; &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot;; &quot;Hook, Line and Sinker&quot;; &quot;Sway with Me&quot;; &quot;Paper Boy (On Main Street U.S.A.)&quot;; &quot;Skinny Minnie&quot;; &quot;B.B. Betty&quot;; &quot;Eloise&quot;; &quot;Whoa Mabel!&quot;; &quot;Vive le Rock and Roll&quot;; &quot;I&#x27;ve Got News For You&quot;; &quot;So Right Tonight&quot;; &quot;Jamaica D.J.&quot;; &quot;Ana Maria&quot;; &quot;Yucatán Twist&quot;; &quot;Football Rock and Roll&quot;; &quot;Let the Good Times Roll Again&quot; in 1979; and &quot;Chick Safari&quot; in 1960.

He also wrote or co-wrote songs for other artists such as &quot;I&#x27;ve Got News for You&quot; for Penny Smith in 1955 on Kahill, &quot;Calypso Rock&quot; for Dave Day and The Red Coats on Kapp in 1956, &quot;Half Your Heart&quot; with Robert J. Hayes for Kitty Nation in 1956 on Wing, &quot;I Oughta&quot; and &quot;Everything But You&quot; for Dotti Malone in 1956 also on Wing, &quot;A.B.C. Rock&quot; and &quot;Rocky the Rockin&#x27; Rabbit&quot; (among others) for Sally Starr for an album she released on Haley&#x27;s own label, Clymax Records, &quot;A Sweet Bunch of Roses&quot; for Country and Western singer Lou Graham, &quot;Toodle-Oo-Bamboo&quot; for Ray Coleman and His Skyrockets on Skyrocket Records in 1959, &quot;Always Together&quot; for the Cook Brothers on Arcade in 1960, &quot;Crazy Street&quot; for The Matys Brothers on Coral Records, &quot;The Cat&quot; for Cappy Bianco, and &quot;(Ya Gotta) Sing For the Ladies&quot; and &quot;Butterfly Love&quot; for Ginger Shannon and Johnny Montana in 1960 on Arcade as well as &quot;I&#x27;m Shook&quot; and &quot;Broke Down Baby&quot;, both of which were recorded by The Tyrones in 1958–59.

==Awards==
In 1982, Haley&#x27;s &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, a special Grammy award established in 1973 to honor recordings at least 25 years old and with &quot;qualitative or historical significance&quot;.

In December 2017, Haley was inducted into the Rhythm and Blues Hall Of Fame.

<text>The northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), also known as the Virginia quail or (in its home range) bobwhite quail, is a ground-dwelling bird native to Canada, the United States, Mexico, and Cuba, with introduced populations elsewhere in the Caribbean, Europe, and Asia. It is a member of the group of species known as New World quail (Odontophoridae). They were initially placed with the Old World quail in the pheasant family (Phasianidae), but are not particularly closely related. The name &quot;bobwhite&quot; is an onomatopoeic derivation from its characteristic whistling call. Despite its secretive nature, the northern bobwhite is one of the most familiar quails in eastern North America, because it is frequently the only quail in its range. Habitat degradation has contributed to the northern bobwhite population in eastern North America declining by roughly 85% from 1966 to 2014. This population decline is apparently range-wide and continuing.

There are 20 subspecies of northern bobwhite, many of which are hunted extensively as game birds. One subspecies, the masked bobwhite (&quot;Colinus virginianus ridgwayi&quot;), is listed as endangered with wild populations located in the northern Mexican state of Sonora and a reintroduced population in Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge in southern Arizona.

==Taxonomy==
The northern bobwhite was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Tetrao virginianus&quot;. Linnaeus specified the type location as &quot;America&quot; but this has been restricted to the state of Virginia. Linnaeus based his account on the &quot;American partridge&quot; that had been described and illustrated by the English naturalist Mark Catesby in his book &quot;The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands&quot;. The northern bobwhite is now one of four species placed in the genus &quot;Colinus&quot; that was introduced in 1820 by the German naturalist Georg August Goldfuss.

===Subspecies===

There are 20 recognized subspecies in four groups. One subspecies, the Key West bobwhite (&quot;C. v. insulanus&quot;), is extinct. The subspecies are listed in taxonomic order:

*Eastern group
**&quot;C. v. virginianus&quot; - Virginia bobwhite - eastern North America from Ontario south to northern Florida (includes former subspecies &quot;marilandicus&quot; and &quot;mexicanus&quot;)
**&quot;C. v. floridanus&quot; – Florida bobwhite – peninsular Florida
**†&quot;C. v. insulanus&quot; – Key West bobwhite – the Florida Keys (extinct)
**&quot;C. v. cubanensis&quot; – Cuban bobwhite – Cuba and Isla de la Juventud; introduced to Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, the Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos islands
**&quot;C. v. taylori&quot; – plains bobwhite – South Dakota to northern Texas, western Missouri and northwestern Arkansas
**&quot;C. v. texanus&quot; – Texas bobwhite – southwestern Texas to northern Mexico
**&quot;C. v. aridus&quot; – Jaumave bobwhite – west-central Tamaulipas to southeastern San Luis Potosí
**&quot;C. v. maculatus&quot; – spot-bellied bobwhite – central Tamaulipas to northern Veracruz and southeastern San Luis Potosí
*Grayson&#x27;s group
**&quot;C. v. graysoni&quot; – Grayson&#x27;s bobwhite – west-central Mexico
**&quot;C. v. nigripectus&quot; – Puebla bobwhite – eastern Mexico
*Black-breasted group
**&quot;C. v. pectoralis&quot; – black-breasted bobwhite – eastern slopes and mountains of central Veracruz
**&quot;C. v. godmani&quot; – Godman&#x27;s bobwhite – eastern slopes and mountains of central Veracruz
**&quot;C. v. minor&quot; – least bobwhite – northeastern Chiapas and Tabasco
**&quot;C. v. thayeri&quot; – Thayer&#x27;s bobwhite – northeastern Oaxaca
*Masked group
**&quot;C. v. ridgwayi&quot; – masked bobwhite – north-central Sonora; reintroduced to Arizona
**&quot;C. v. atriceps&quot; – black-headed bobwhite – interior of western Oaxaca
**&quot;C. v. harrisoni&quot; – Harrison&#x27;s bobwhite – southwestern Oaxaca
**&quot;C. v. coyoleos&quot; – Coyoleos bobwhite – Pacific Coast of Oaxaca and Chiapas
**&quot;C. v. salvini&quot; – Salvin&#x27;s bobwhite – coastal and southern Chiapas
**&quot;C. v. insignis&quot; – Guatemalan bobwhite – Guatemala (Rio Chiapas Valley) and southeastern Chiapas (includes former subspecies &quot;nelsoni&quot;)

The holotype specimen of &quot;Ortyx pectoralis&quot; Gould (Proc. Zool. Soc. London, 1842 (1843), p.182.) is held in the collections of the National Museums Liverpool at the World Museum, with accession number D3713. The specimen died in the aviary at Knowsley Hall, Lancashire and came to the Liverpool national collection via the 13th Earl of Derby&#x27;s collection, which was bequeathed to the people of Liverpool in 1851.

==Description==
The northern bobwhite is a moderately-sized quail, and is the only small galliform native to eastern North America. The bobwhite can range from in length with a wingspan. As indicated by body mass, weights increase in birds found further north, as corresponds to Bergmann&#x27;s rule. In Mexico, northern bobwhites weigh from whereas in the north they average and large males can attain as much as . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is the culmen is and the tarsus is . It has the typical chunky, rounded shape of a quail. The bill is short, curved and brown-black in color. This species is sexually dimorphic. Males have a white throat and brow stripe bordered by black. The overall rufous plumage has gray mottling on the wings, white scalloped stripes on the flanks, and black scallops on the whitish underparts. The tail is gray.

The clear whistle &quot;bob-WHITE&quot; or &quot;bob-bob-WHITE&quot; call is very recognizable. The syllables are slow and widely spaced, rising in pitch a full octave from beginning to end. Other calls include lisps, peeps, and more rapidly whistled warning calls. 

==Distribution and habitat==
The northern bobwhite can be found year-round in agricultural fields, grassland, open woodland areas, roadsides and wood edges. Its range covers the southeastern quadrant of the United States from the Great Lakes and southern Minnesota east to New York State and southern Massachusetts, and extending west to southern Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Colorado front-range foothills to 7,000 feet, and all but westernmost Texas.

It is absent from the southern tip of Florida (where the extinct Key West bobwhite subspecies once lived) and the highest elevations of the Appalachian Mountains, but occurs in eastern Mexico and in Cuba, and has been introduced to Hispaniola (both the Dominican Republic and Haiti), the Bahamas, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands (formerly), Puerto Rico, France, China, Portugal, and Italy. Isolated populations also have been introduced in Oregon and Washington. The northern bobwhite has also been introduced to New Zealand.

There is no self-sustaining population in Pennsylvania, where the bird is considered extirpated; it is also considered extirpated in the states of New Hampshire and Connecticut. Its distribution in New York has been limited to Suffolk and Nassau Counties on Long Island, as well as potential population pockets in Upstate New York. The bird is considered declining or extirpated throughout much of the Northeastern United States. Similarly, the bird is almost extirpated from Ontario (and Canada as a whole), with the only self-sustaining population confirmed to exist recorded on Walpole Island.

==Behavior and ecology==

Like most game birds, the northern bobwhite is shy and elusive. When threatened, it will crouch and freeze, relying on camouflage to stay undetected, but will flush into low flight if closely disturbed. It is generally solitary or paired early in the year, but family groups are common in the late summer and winter roosts may have two dozen or more birds in a single covey.

=== Breeding ===
The species was once considered monogamous, but with the advent of radio telemetry, the sexual behavior of bobwhites has better been described as ambisexual polygamy. Either parent may incubate a clutch for 23 days, and the precocial young leave the nest shortly after hatching. The main source of nest failure is predation, with nest success averaging 28% across their range. However, the nest success of stable populations is typically much higher than this average, and the aforementioned estimate includes values for declining populations.

Brooding behavior varies in that amalgamation (kidnapping, adopting, creching, gang brooding) may occur. An incubating parent may alternatively stay with its young. A hen may re-nest up to four times until she has a successful nest. However, it is extremely rare for bobwhites to hatch more than two successful nests within one nesting season.

===Food and feeding===
The northern bobwhite&#x27;s diet consists of plant material and small invertebrates, such as snails, ticks, grasshoppers, beetles, spiders, crickets, and leafhoppers. Plant sources include seeds, wild berries, partridge peas, and cultivated grains. It forages on the ground in open areas with some spots of taller vegetation.

Optimal nutrient requirements for bobwhite vary depending on the age of bird and the time of the year. For example, the optimal protein requirement for egg laying hens (23% protein) is much higher than for males (16%).

== Relationship to humans ==

===Introduced populations===

==== European Union ====

Northern bobwhite were introduced into Italy in 1927, and are reported in the plains and hills in the northwest of the country. Other reports from the EU are in France, Spain, and the Balkans. As bobwhites are highly productive and popular aviary subjects, it is reasonable to expect other introductions have been made in other parts of the EU, especially in the U.K. and Ireland, where game-bird breeding, liberation, and naturalization are relatively common practices.

==== New Zealand ====

From 1898 to 1902, some 1,300 birds were imported from America and released in many parts of the North and South Islands, from Northland to Southland. The bird was briefly on the Nelson game shooting licence, but: &quot;It would seem that the committee was a little too eager in placing these Quail on the licence, or the shooters of the day were over-zealous and greedy in their bag limits, for the Virginian Quail, like the Mountain Quail were soon a thing of the past.&quot; The Taranaki (Acclimatisation) Society released a few in 1900 and was confidant that in a year or two they might offer good sport; two years later, broods were reported and the species was said to be &quot;steadily increasing&quot;; but after another two years they seemed &quot;to have disappeared&quot; and that was the end of them. The Otago (Acclimatisation) Society imported more in 1948, but these releases did no good. After 1923, no more genuinely wild birds were sighted until 1952, when a small population was found northwest of Wairoa in the Ruapapa Road area. Since then, bobwhite have been found at several localities around Waikaremoana, in farmland, open bush and along roadsides.

More birds have been imported into New Zealand by private individuals since the 1990s and a healthy captive population is now held by backyard aviculturists and have been found to be easily cared for and bred and are popular for their song and good looks. A larger proportion of the national captive population belong to a few game preserves and game bird breeders. Though the birds would be self-sustaining in the wild if they were protected; it is tricky to guess what the effect of an annual population subsidy and hunting has on any of the original populations from the Acclimatisation Society releases.

An albino hen was present in a covey in Bayview, Hawkes Bay for a couple of seasons sometime around 2000.

===Captivity===
==== Housing ====

Bobwhites are generally compatible with most parrots, softbills and doves. This species should, however, be the only ground-dwelling species in the aviary. Most individuals will do little damage to finches, but one should watch that nests are not being crushed when the species perches at night. Single pairs are preferred, unless the birds have been raised together as a group since they were chicks. Some fighting will occur between cocks at breeding time. One cock may be capable of breeding with several hens, but the fertility seems to be highest in the eggs from the &quot;preferred&quot; hen. Aviary style is a compromise between what is tolerated by the bird and what is best for the bird. Open parrot-style type aviaries may be used, but some birds will remain flighty and shy in this situation. In a planted aviary, this species will generally settle down to become quite tame and confiding. Parents with chicks will roost on the ground, forming a circular arrangement, with heads facing outwards. In the early morning and late afternoon, the cock will utter his call, which, although not loud, carries well and may offend noise-sensitive neighbors. Most breeding facilities keep birds in breeding groups on wire up off the ground. 

==== Feeding ====

In the wild the northern bobwhite feeds on a variety of weed and grass seeds, as well as insects. These are generally collected on the ground or from low foliage. Birds in the aviary are easily catered for with a commercial small seed mix (finch, budgerigar, or small parrot mix) when supplemented with greenfeed. Live food is not usually necessary for breeding, but will be ravenously accepted. High protein foods such as chicken grower crumble are more convenient to supply and will be useful for the stimulation of breeding birds. Extra calcium is required, especially by laying hens; it can be supplied in the form of shell grit, or cuttlefish bone.

==== Breeding ====
If a nesting site and privacy are not provided, hens will lay anywhere within an open aviary. Hens that do this may, in a season, lay upwards of 80 eggs, which can be taken for artificial incubation and the chicks hand-raised. Hens with nesting cover that do make a nest (on the ground) will build up 8–25 eggs in a clutch, with eggs being laid daily.

==== Mutations and hybrids ====

Some captive bobwhite hybrids recorded are between blue quail (scaled quail), Gambel&#x27;s quail, California quail, and mountain quail. It has long been suggested that there are Japanese quail hybrids being bred commercially; however, there is a distinct lack of photographic proof to substantiate this. Inter-subspecific hybrids have been common.

Several mutations have long been established, including Californian Jumbo, Wisconsin Jumbo, Northern Giant, Albino, Snowflake, Blonde, Fawn, Barred, Silver, and Red.

== Status ==
The northern bobwhite is rated as a Near-threatened species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The northern bobwhite is threatened across its range due to habitat loss and habitat degradation. Changing land use patterns and changing fire regimes have caused once prime habitat to become unfavorable for the bobwhite.

=== Masked bobwhite ===
The masked bobwhite subspecies, &quot;C. v. ridgwayi&quot;, is listed as endangered in the U.S. The birds were twice declared extirpated in Arizona in the past century. It was originally endemic to southern Arizona in the U.S., and northern Sonora in Mexico. It is considered a &quot;Critically Imperiled Subspecies&quot; by NatureServe.

The masked bobwhite was in decline since its discovery in 1884. By 1900, the subspecies was already extinct in the U.S. Populations remained in Mexico, but their study was curtailed by political events in Mexico, including the Mexican Revolution and the last of the Yaqui Wars. A population of the masked bobwhite was finally discovered and studied in Mexico, in 1931 and 1932.

A native population historically existed in Sonora, but by 2017, its population appeared to be declining, or possibly extinct. A 2017 study recorded no wild sightings of the bird in Sonora. Decline of the species has been attributed to intense livestock grazing in an ecosystem that does not rejuvenate quickly.

A captive flock was established in Arizona in the 1970s. The George Miksch Sutton Avian Research Center (Sutton Center) became involved with conservation efforts in 2017 to establish a breeding population at the Sutton Center in Oklahoma, in order to reintroduce birds to Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge (BANWR). In 2019, biologists from the Sutton Center transported 1,000 chicks by road vehicle to Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge. In 2020, a projected total of 1,200 birds will be transported by airplanes to BANWR. These recent actions are supplemental, and in addition to other conservation efforts in the past, seem to aid the subspecies&#x27; future conservation efforts.

== In popular culture ==
In 2023, the masked bobwhite subspecies will be featured on a United States Postal Service Forever stamp as part of the &quot;Endangered Species&quot; set, based on a photograph from Joel Sartore&#x27;s &quot;Photo Ark&quot;. The stamp will be dedicated at a ceremony at the National Grasslands Visitor Center in Wall, South Dakota.

<doc id="4531" wikidata="Q131755" url="?curid=4531" title="Bipolar disorder">
<text>Bipolar disorder, previously known as manic depression, is a mental disorder characterized by periods of depression and periods of abnormally elevated mood that each last from days to weeks, and in some cases months. If the elevated mood is severe or associated with psychosis, it is called &quot;mania&quot;; if it is less severe and does not significantly affect functioning, it is called &quot;hypomania&quot;. During mania, an individual behaves or feels abnormally energetic, happy, or irritable, and they often make impulsive decisions with little regard for the consequences. There is usually, but not always, a reduced need for sleep during manic phases. During periods of depression, the individual may experience crying, have a negative outlook on life, and demonstrate poor eye contact with others. The risk of suicide is high. Over a period of 20 years, 6% of those with bipolar disorder died by suicide, with about one-third attempting suicide in their lifetime. Among those with the disorder, 40-50% overall and 78% of adolescents engaged in self-harm. Other mental health issues, such as anxiety disorders and substance use disorders, are commonly associated with bipolar disorder. The global prevalence of bipolar disorder is estimated to be between 1–5% of the world&#x27;s population.

While the causes of this mood disorder are not clearly understood, both genetic and environmental factors are thought to play a role. Genetic factors may account for up to 70–90% of the risk of developing bipolar disorder. Many genes, each with small effects, may contribute to the development of the disorder. Environmental risk factors include a history of childhood abuse and long-term stress. The condition is classified as bipolar I disorder if there has been at least one manic episode, with or without depressive episodes, and as bipolar II disorder if there has been at least one hypomanic episode (but no full manic episodes) and one major depressive episode. It is classified as cyclothymia if there are hypomanic episodes with periods of depression that do not meet the criteria for major depressive episodes.
If these symptoms are due to drugs or medical problems, they are not diagnosed as bipolar disorder. Other conditions that have overlapping symptoms with bipolar disorder include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, personality disorders, schizophrenia, and substance use disorder as well as many other medical conditions. Medical testing is not required for a diagnosis, though blood tests or medical imaging can rule out other problems.

Mood stabilizers, particularly lithium, and certain anticonvulsants, such as lamotrigine and valproate, as well as atypical antipsychotics, including quetiapine, olanzapine, and aripiprazole are the mainstay of long-term pharmacologic relapse prevention. Antipsychotics are additionally given during acute manic episodes as well as in cases where mood stabilizers are poorly tolerated or ineffective. In patients where compliance is of concern, long-acting injectable formulations are available. There is some evidence that psychotherapy improves the course of this disorder. The use of antidepressants in depressive episodes is controversial: they can be effective but certain classes of antidepressants increase the risk of mania. The treatment of depressive episodes, therefore, is often difficult. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is effective in acute manic and depressive episodes, especially with psychosis or catatonia. Admission to a psychiatric hospital may be required if a person is a risk to themselves or others; involuntary treatment is sometimes necessary if the affected person refuses treatment.

Bipolar disorder occurs in approximately 2% of the global population. In the United States, about 3% are estimated to be affected at some point in their life; rates appear to be similar in females and males. Symptoms most commonly begin between the ages of 20 and 25 years old; an earlier onset in life is associated with a worse prognosis. Interest in functioning in the assessment of patients with bipolar disorder is growing, with an emphasis on specific domains such as work, education, social life, family, and cognition. Around one-quarter to one-third of people with bipolar disorder have financial, social or work-related problems due to the illness. Bipolar disorder is among the top 20 causes of disability worldwide and leads to substantial costs for society. Due to lifestyle choices and the side effects of medications, the risk of death from natural causes such as coronary heart disease in people with bipolar disorder is twice that of the general population.
== Signs and symptoms ==

Late adolescence and early adulthood are peak years for the onset of bipolar disorder. The condition is characterized by intermittent episodes of mania, commonly (but not in every patient) alternating with bouts of depression, with an absence of symptoms in between. During these episodes, people with bipolar disorder exhibit disruptions in normal mood, psychomotor activity (the level of physical activity that is influenced by mood)—e.g. constant fidgeting during mania or slowed movements during depression—circadian rhythm and cognition. Mania can present with varying levels of mood disturbance, ranging from euphoria, which is associated with &quot;classic mania&quot;, to dysphoria and irritability. Psychotic symptoms such as delusions or hallucinations may occur in both manic and depressive episodes; their content and nature are consistent with the person&#x27;s prevailing mood. In some people with bipolar disorder, depressive symptoms predominate, and the episodes of mania are always the more subdued hypomania type.

According to the DSM-5 criteria, mania is distinguished from hypomania by the duration: hypomania is present if elevated mood symptoms persist for at least four consecutive days, while mania is present if such symptoms persist for more than a week. Unlike mania, hypomania is not always associated with impaired functioning. The biological mechanisms responsible for switching from a manic or hypomanic episode to a depressive episode, or vice versa, remain poorly understood.

=== Manic episodes ===
Also known as a manic episode, mania is a distinct period of at least one week of elevated or irritable mood, which can range from euphoria to delirium. The core symptom of mania involves an increase in energy of psychomotor activity. Mania can also present with increased self-esteem or grandiosity, racing thoughts, pressured speech that is difficult to interrupt, decreased need for sleep, disinhibited social behavior, increased goal-oriented activities and impaired judgement, which can lead to exhibition of behaviors characterized as impulsive or high-risk, such as hypersexuality or excessive spending. To fit the definition of a manic episode, these behaviors must impair the individual&#x27;s ability to socialize or work. If untreated, a manic episode usually lasts three to six months.

In severe manic episodes, a person can experience psychotic symptoms, where thought content is affected along with mood. They may feel unstoppable, persecuted, or as if they have a special relationship with God, a great mission to accomplish, or other grandiose or delusional ideas. This may lead to violent behavior and, sometimes, hospitalization in an inpatient psychiatric hospital. The severity of manic symptoms can be measured by rating scales such as the Young Mania Rating Scale, though questions remain about the reliability of these scales.

The onset of a manic or depressive episode is often foreshadowed by sleep disturbance. Manic individuals often have a history of substance use disorder developed over years as a form of &quot;self-medication&quot;.

=== Hypomanic episodes ===
Hypomania is the milder form of mania, defined as at least four days of the same criteria as mania, but which does not cause a significant decrease in the individual&#x27;s ability to socialize or work, lacks psychotic features such as delusions or hallucinations, and does not require psychiatric hospitalization. Overall functioning may actually increase during episodes of hypomania and is thought to serve as a defense mechanism against depression by some. Hypomanic episodes rarely progress to full-blown manic episodes. Some people who experience hypomania show increased creativity, while others are irritable or demonstrate poor judgment.

Hypomania may feel good to some individuals who experience it, though most people who experience hypomania state that the stress of the experience is very painful. People with bipolar disorder who experience hypomania tend to forget the effects of their actions on those around them. Even when family and friends recognize mood swings, the individual will often deny that anything is wrong. If not accompanied by depressive episodes, hypomanic episodes are often not deemed problematic unless the mood changes are uncontrollable or volatile. Most commonly, symptoms continue for time periods from a few weeks to a few months.

=== Depressive episodes ===

Symptoms of the depressive phase of bipolar disorder include persistent feelings of sadness, irritability or anger, loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities, excessive or inappropriate guilt, hopelessness, sleeping too much or not enough, changes in appetite or weight, fatigue, problems concentrating, self-loathing or feelings of worthlessness, and thoughts of death or suicide. Although the DSM-5 criteria for diagnosing unipolar and bipolar episodes are the same, some clinical features are more common in the latter, including increased sleep, sudden onset and resolution of symptoms, significant weight gain or loss, and severe episodes after childbirth.

The earlier the age of onset, the more likely the first few episodes are to be depressive. For most people with bipolar types 1 and 2, the depressive episodes are much longer than the manic or hypomanic episodes. Since a diagnosis of bipolar disorder requires a manic or hypomanic episode, many affected individuals are initially misdiagnosed as having major depression and treated with prescribed antidepressants.

=== Mixed affective episodes ===
In bipolar disorder, a mixed state is an episode during which symptoms of both mania and depression occur simultaneously. Individuals experiencing a mixed state may have manic symptoms such as grandiose thoughts while simultaneously experiencing depressive symptoms such as excessive guilt or feeling suicidal. They are considered to have a higher risk for suicidal behavior as depressive emotions such as hopelessness are often paired with mood swings or difficulties with impulse control. Anxiety disorders occur more frequently as a comorbidity in mixed bipolar episodes than in non-mixed bipolar depression or mania. Substance (including alcohol) use also follows this trend, thereby appearing to depict bipolar symptoms as no more than a consequence of substance use.

=== Comorbid conditions ===
People with bipolar disorder often have other co-existing psychiatric conditions such as anxiety (present in about 71% of people with bipolar disorder), substance abuse (56%), personality disorders (36%) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (10–20%) which can add to the burden of illness and worsen the prognosis. Certain medical conditions are also more common in people with bipolar disorder as compared to the general population. This includes increased rates of metabolic syndrome (present in 37% of people with bipolar disorder), migraine headaches (35%), obesity (21%) and type 2 diabetes (14%). This contributes to a risk of death that is two times higher in those with bipolar disorder as compared to the general population. Hypothyroidism is also common regardless of drug choice.

Substance use disorder is a common comorbidity in bipolar disorder; the subject has been widely reviewed.

== Causes ==
The causes of bipolar disorder likely vary between individuals and the exact mechanism underlying the disorder remains unclear. Genetic influences are believed to account for 73–93% of the risk of developing the disorder indicating a strong hereditary component. The overall heritability of the bipolar spectrum has been estimated at 0.71. Twin studies have been limited by relatively small sample sizes but have indicated a substantial genetic contribution, as well as environmental influence. For bipolar I disorder, the rate at which identical twins (same genes) will both have bipolar I disorder (concordance) is around 40%, compared to about 5% in fraternal twins. A combination of bipolar I, II, and cyclothymia similarly produced rates of 42% and 11% (identical and fraternal twins, respectively). The rates of bipolar II combinations without bipolar I are lowerbipolar II at 23 and 17%, and bipolar II combining with cyclothymia at 33 and 14%which may reflect relatively higher genetic heterogeneity.

The cause of bipolar disorders overlaps with major depressive disorder. When defining concordance as the co-twins having either bipolar disorder or major depression, then the concordance rate rises to 67% in identical twins and 19% in fraternal twins. The relatively low concordance between fraternal twins brought up together suggests that shared family environmental effects are limited, although the ability to detect them has been limited by small sample sizes.

=== Genetic ===
Behavioral genetic studies have suggested that many chromosomal regions and candidate genes are related to bipolar disorder susceptibility with each gene exerting a mild to moderate effect. The risk of bipolar disorder is nearly ten-fold higher in first-degree relatives of those with bipolar disorder than in the general population; similarly, the risk of major depressive disorder is three times higher in relatives of those with bipolar disorder than in the general population.

Although the first genetic linkage finding for mania was in 1969, linkage studies have been inconsistent. Findings point strongly to heterogeneity, with different genes implicated in different families. Robust and replicable genome-wide significant associations showed several common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with bipolar disorder, including variants within the genes &quot;CACNA1C&quot;, &quot;ODZ4&quot;, and &quot;NCAN&quot;. The largest and most recent genome-wide association study failed to find any locus that exerts a large effect, reinforcing the idea that no single gene is responsible for bipolar disorder in most cases. Polymorphisms in &quot;BDNF&quot;, &quot;DRD4&quot;, &quot;DAO&quot;, and &quot;TPH1&quot; have been frequently associated with bipolar disorder and were initially associated in a meta-analysis, but this association disappeared after correction for multiple testing. On the other hand, two polymorphisms in &quot;TPH2&quot; were identified as being associated with bipolar disorder.

Due to the inconsistent findings in a genome-wide association study, multiple studies have undertaken the approach of analyzing SNPs in biological pathways. Signaling pathways traditionally associated with bipolar disorder that have been supported by these studies include corticotropin-releasing hormone signaling, cardiac β-adrenergic signaling, phospholipase C signaling, glutamate receptor signaling, cardiac hypertrophy signaling, Wnt signaling, Notch signaling, and endothelin 1 signaling. Of the 16 genes identified in these pathways, three were found to be dysregulated in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex portion of the brain in post-mortem studies: &quot;CACNA1C&quot;, &quot;GNG2&quot;, and &quot;ITPR2&quot;.

Bipolar disorder is associated with reduced expression of specific DNA repair enzymes and increased levels of oxidative DNA damages.

=== Environmental ===
Psychosocial factors play a significant role in the development and course of bipolar disorder, and individual psychosocial variables may interact with genetic dispositions. Recent life events and interpersonal relationships likely contribute to the onset and recurrence of bipolar mood episodes, just as they do for unipolar depression. In surveys, 30–50% of adults diagnosed with bipolar disorder report traumatic/abusive experiences in childhood, which is associated with earlier onset, a higher rate of suicide attempts, and more co-occurring disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder. Subtypes of abuse, such as sexual and emotional abuse, also contribute to violent behaviors seen in patients with bipolar disorder. The number of reported stressful events in childhood is higher in those with an adult diagnosis of bipolar spectrum disorder than in those without, particularly events stemming from a harsh environment rather than from the child&#x27;s own behavior. Acutely, mania can be induced by sleep deprivation in around 30% of people with bipolar disorder.

=== Neurological ===
Less commonly, bipolar disorder or a bipolar-like disorder may occur as a result of or in association with a neurological condition or injury including stroke, traumatic brain injury, HIV infection, multiple sclerosis, porphyria, and rarely temporal lobe epilepsy.

==Proposed mechanisms==


The precise mechanisms that cause bipolar disorder are not well understood. Bipolar disorder is thought to be associated with abnormalities in the structure and function of certain brain areas responsible for cognitive tasks and the processing of emotions. A neurologic model for bipolar disorder proposes that the emotional circuitry of the brain can be divided into two main parts. The ventral system (regulates emotional perception) includes brain structures such as the amygdala, insula, ventral striatum, ventral anterior cingulate cortex, and the prefrontal cortex. The dorsal system (responsible for emotional regulation) includes the hippocampus, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and other parts of the prefrontal cortex. The model hypothesizes that bipolar disorder may occur when the ventral system is overactivated and the dorsal system is underactivated. Other models suggest the ability to regulate emotions is disrupted in people with bipolar disorder and that dysfunction of the ventricular prefrontal cortex is crucial to this disruption.

Meta-analyses of structural MRI studies have shown that certain brain regions (e.g., the left rostral anterior cingulate cortex, fronto-insular cortex, ventral prefrontal cortex, and claustrum) are smaller in people with bipolar disorder, whereas other regions are larger (lateral ventricles, globus pallidus, subgenual anterior cingulate, and the amygdala). Additionally, these meta-analyses found that people with bipolar disorder have higher rates of deep white matter hyperintensities.

Functional MRI findings suggest that the ventricular prefrontal cortex regulates the limbic system, especially the amygdala. In people with bipolar disorder, decreased ventricular prefrontal cortex activity allows for the dysregulated activity of the amygdala, which likely contributes to labile mood and poor emotional regulation. Consistent with this, pharmacological treatment of mania returns ventricular prefrontal cortex activity to the levels in non-manic people, suggesting that ventricular prefrontal cortex activity is an indicator of mood state. However, while pharmacological treatment of mania reduces amygdala hyperactivity, it remains more active than the amygdala of those without bipolar disorder, suggesting amygdala activity may be a marker of the disorder rather than the current mood state. Manic and depressive episodes tend to be characterized by dysfunction in different regions of the ventricular prefrontal cortex. Manic episodes appear to be associated with decreased activation of the right ventricular prefrontal cortex whereas depressive episodes are associated with decreased activation of the left ventricular prefrontal cortex. These disruptions often occur during development linked with synaptic pruning dysfunction.

People with bipolar disorder who are in a euthymic mood state show decreased activity in the lingual gyrus compared to people without bipolar disorder. In contrast, they demonstrate decreased activity in the inferior frontal cortex during manic episodes compared to people without the disorder. Similar studies examining the differences in brain activity between people with bipolar disorder and those without did not find a consistent area in the brain that was more or less active when comparing these two groups. People with bipolar have increased activation of left hemisphere ventral limbic areaswhich mediate emotional experiences and generation of emotional responsesand decreased activation of right hemisphere cortical structures related to cognitionstructures associated with the regulation of emotions. However, further research is needed to consolidate neuroimaging findings, which are often heterogeneous and not consistently reported according to a common standard.

Neuroscientists have proposed additional models to try to explain the cause of bipolar disorder. One proposed model for bipolar disorder suggests that hypersensitivity of reward circuits consisting of frontostriatal circuits causes mania, and decreased sensitivity of these circuits causes depression. According to the &quot;kindling&quot; hypothesis, when people who are genetically predisposed toward bipolar disorder experience stressful events, the stress threshold at which mood changes occur becomes progressively lower, until the episodes eventually start (and recur) spontaneously. There is evidence supporting an association between early-life stress and dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis leading to its overactivation, which may play a role in the pathogenesis of bipolar disorder. Other brain components that have been proposed to play a role in bipolar disorder are the mitochondria and a sodium ATPase pump. Circadian rhythms and regulation of the hormone melatonin also seem to be altered.

Dopamine, a neurotransmitter responsible for mood cycling, has increased transmission during the manic phase. The dopamine hypothesis states that the increase in dopamine results in secondary homeostatic downregulation of key system elements and receptors such as lower sensitivity of dopaminergic receptors. This results in decreased dopamine transmission characteristic of the depressive phase. The depressive phase ends with homeostatic upregulation potentially restarting the cycle over again. Glutamate is significantly increased within the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during the manic phase of bipolar disorder, and returns to normal levels once the phase is over.

Medications used to treat bipolar may exert their effect by modulating intracellular signaling, such as through depleting myo-inositol levels, inhibition of cAMP signaling, and through altering subunits of the dopamine-associated G-protein. Consistent with this, elevated levels of Gαi, Gαs, and Gαq/11 have been reported in brain and blood samples, along with increased protein kinase A (PKA) expression and sensitivity; typically, PKA activates as part of the intracellular signalling cascade downstream from the detachment of Gαs subunit from the G protein complex.

Decreased levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, a byproduct of serotonin, are present in the cerebrospinal fluid of persons with bipolar disorder during both the depressed and manic phases. Increased dopaminergic activity has been hypothesized in manic states due to the ability of dopamine agonists to stimulate mania in people with bipolar disorder. Decreased sensitivity of regulatory α2 adrenergic receptors as well as increased cell counts in the locus coeruleus indicated increased noradrenergic activity in manic people. Low plasma GABA levels on both sides of the mood spectrum have been found. One review found no difference in monoamine levels, but found abnormal norepinephrine turnover in people with bipolar disorder. Tyrosine depletion was found to reduce the effects of methamphetamine in people with bipolar disorder as well as symptoms of mania, implicating dopamine in mania. VMAT2 binding was found to be increased in one study of people with bipolar mania.

== Diagnosis ==
Bipolar disorder is commonly diagnosed during adolescence or early adulthood, but onset can occur throughout life. Its diagnosis is based on the self-reported experiences of the individual, abnormal behavior reported by family members, friends or co-workers, observable signs of illness as assessed by a clinician, and ideally a medical work-up to rule out other causes. Caregiver-scored rating scales, specifically from the mother, have shown to be more accurate than teacher and youth-scored reports in identifying youths with bipolar disorder. Assessment is usually done on an outpatient basis; admission to an inpatient facility is considered if there is a risk to oneself or others.

The most widely used criteria for diagnosing bipolar disorder are from the American Psychiatric Association&#x27;s (APA) &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot;, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) and the World Health Organization&#x27;s (WHO) &quot;International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems&quot;, 10th Edition (ICD-10). The ICD-10 criteria are used more often in clinical settings outside of the U.S. while the DSM criteria are used within the U.S. and are the prevailing criteria used internationally in research studies. The DSM-5, published in 2013, includes further and more accurate specifiers compared to its predecessor, the DSM-IV-TR. This work has influenced the eleventh revision of the ICD, which includes the various diagnoses within the bipolar spectrum of the DSM-V.

Several rating scales for the screening and evaluation of bipolar disorder exist, including the Bipolar spectrum diagnostic scale, Mood Disorder Questionnaire, the General Behavior Inventory and the Hypomania Checklist. The use of evaluation scales cannot substitute a full clinical interview but they serve to systematize the recollection of symptoms. On the other hand, instruments for screening bipolar disorder tend to have lower sensitivity.

=== Differential diagnosis ===
Bipolar disorder is classified by the International Classification of Diseases as a mental and behavioural disorder. Mental disorders that can have symptoms similar to those seen in bipolar disorder include schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and certain personality disorders, such as borderline personality disorder. A key difference between bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder is the nature of the mood swings; in contrast to the sustained changes to mood over days to weeks or longer, those of the latter condition (more accurately called emotional dysregulation) are sudden and often short-lived, and secondary to social stressors.

Although there are no biological tests that are diagnostic of bipolar disorder, blood tests and/or imaging are carried out to investigate whether medical illnesses with clinical presentations similar to that of bipolar disorder are present before making a definitive diagnosis. Neurologic diseases such as multiple sclerosis, complex partial seizures, strokes, brain tumors, Wilson&#x27;s disease, traumatic brain injury, Huntington&#x27;s disease, and complex migraines can mimic features of bipolar disorder. An EEG may be used to exclude neurological disorders such as epilepsy, and a CT scan or MRI of the head may be used to exclude brain lesions. Additionally, disorders of the endocrine system such as hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and Cushing&#x27;s disease are in the differential as is the connective tissue disease systemic lupus erythematosus. Infectious causes of mania that may appear similar to bipolar mania include herpes encephalitis, HIV, influenza, or neurosyphilis. Certain vitamin deficiencies such as pellagra (niacin deficiency), vitamin B12 deficiency, folate deficiency, and Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome (thiamine deficiency) can also lead to mania. Common medications that can cause manic symptoms include antidepressants, prednisone, Parkinson&#x27;s disease medications, thyroid hormone, stimulants (including cocaine and methamphetamine), and certain antibiotics.

=== Bipolar spectrum ===

Bipolar spectrum disorders include: bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder, cyclothymic disorder and cases where subthreshold symptoms are found to cause clinically significant impairment or distress. These disorders involve major depressive episodes that alternate with manic or hypomanic episodes, or with mixed episodes that feature symptoms of both mood states. The concept of the bipolar spectrum is similar to that of Emil Kraepelin&#x27;s original concept of manic depressive illness. Bipolar II disorder was established as a diagnosis in 1994 within DSM IV; though debate continues over whether it is a distinct entity, part of a spectrum, or exists at all.

=== Criteria and subtypes ===
The DSM and the ICD characterize bipolar disorder as a spectrum of disorders occurring on a continuum. The DSM-5 and ICD-11 lists three specific subtypes:
* Bipolar I disorder: At least one manic episode is necessary to make the diagnosis; depressive episodes are common in the vast majority of cases with bipolar disorder I, but are unnecessary for the diagnosis. Specifiers such as &quot;mild, moderate, moderate-severe, severe&quot; and &quot;with psychotic features&quot; should be added as applicable to indicate the presentation and course of the disorder.
* Bipolar II disorder: No manic episodes and one or more hypomanic episodes and one or more major depressive episodes. Hypomanic episodes do not go to the full extremes of mania (&quot;i.e.&quot;, do not usually cause severe social or occupational impairment, and are without psychosis), and this can make bipolar II more difficult to diagnose, since the hypomanic episodes may simply appear as periods of successful high productivity and are reported less frequently than a distressing, crippling depression.
* Cyclothymia: A history of hypomanic episodes with periods of depression that do not meet criteria for major depressive episodes.

When relevant, specifiers for &quot;peripartum onset&quot; and &quot;with rapid cycling&quot; should be used with any subtype. Individuals who have subthreshold symptoms that cause clinically significant distress or impairment, but do not meet full criteria for one of the three subtypes may be diagnosed with other specified or unspecified bipolar disorder. Other specified bipolar disorder is used when a clinician chooses to explain why the full criteria were not met (e.g., hypomania without a prior major depressive episode). If the condition is thought to have a non-psychiatric medical cause, the diagnosis of &quot;bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition&quot; is made, while &quot;substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder&quot; is used if a medication is thought to have triggered the condition.

==== Rapid cycling ====
Most people who meet criteria for bipolar disorder experience a number of episodes, on average 0.4 to 0.7 per year, lasting three to six months. &quot;Rapid cycling&quot;, however, is a course specifier that may be applied to any bipolar subtype. It is defined as having four or more mood disturbance episodes within a one-year span. Rapid cycling is usually temporary but is common amongst people with bipolar disorder and affects 25.8–45.3% of them at some point in their life. These episodes are separated from each other by a remission (partial or full) for at least two months or a switch in mood polarity (i.e., from a depressive episode to a manic episode or vice versa). The definition of rapid cycling most frequently cited in the literature (including the DSM-V and ICD-11) is that of Dunner and Fieve: at least four major depressive, manic, hypomanic or mixed episodes during a 12-month period. The literature examining the pharmacological treatment of rapid cycling is sparse and there is no clear consensus with respect to its optimal pharmacological management. &quot;Ultra rapid&quot; and &quot;ultradian&quot; have been applied to faster-cycling types of bipolar disorder. People with the rapid cycling or faster-cycling subtypes of bipolar disorder tend to be more difficult to treat and less responsive to medications than other people with bipolar disorder.

=== Coexisting psychiatric conditions ===
The diagnosis of bipolar disorder can be complicated by coexisting (comorbid) psychiatric conditions including obsessive–compulsive disorder, substance-use disorder, eating disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, social phobia, premenstrual syndrome (including premenstrual dysphoric disorder), or panic disorder. A thorough longitudinal analysis of symptoms and episodes, assisted if possible by discussions with friends and family members, is crucial to establishing a treatment plan where these comorbidities exist. Children of parents with bipolar disorder more frequently have other mental health problems.

=== Children ===
In the 1920s, Kraepelin noted that manic episodes are rare before puberty. In general, bipolar disorder in children was not recognized in the first half of the twentieth century. This issue diminished with an increased following of the DSM criteria in the last part of the twentieth century. The diagnosis of childhood bipolar disorder, while formerly controversial, has gained greater acceptance among childhood and adolescent psychiatrists. American children and adolescents diagnosed with bipolar disorder in community hospitals increased 4-fold reaching rates of up to 40% in 10 years around the beginning of the 21st century, while in outpatient clinics it doubled reaching 6%. Studies using DSM criteria show that up to 1% of youth may have bipolar disorder. The DSM-5 has established a diagnosis—disruptive mood dysregulation disorder—that covers children with long-term, persistent irritability that had at times been misdiagnosed as having bipolar disorder, distinct from irritability in bipolar disorder that is restricted to discrete mood episodes.

=== Adults ===
Bipolar on average, starts during adulthood. Bipolar 1, on average, starts at the age of 18 years old, and Bipolar 2 starts at age 22 years old on average. However, most delay seeking treatment for an average of 8 years after symptoms start. Bipolar is often misdiagnosed with other psychiatric disorders. There is no definitive association between race, ethnicity, or Socioeconomic status (SES). Adults with Bipolar report having a lower quality of life, even outside of a manic or depressive episode. Bipolar can put strain on marriage and other relationships, having a job, and everyday functioning. Bipolar is associated with having higher rates of unemployment. Most have trouble keeping a job, leading to trouble with healthcare access, leading to more decline in their mental health due to not receiving treatment such as medicine and therapy.

=== Elderly ===
Bipolar disorder is uncommon in older patients, with a measured lifetime prevalence of 1% in over 60s and a 12-month prevalence of 0.10.5% in people over 65. Despite this, it is overrepresented in psychiatric admissions, making up 48% of inpatient admission to aged care psychiatry units, and the incidence of mood disorders is increasing overall with the aging population. Depressive episodes more commonly present with sleep disturbance, fatigue, hopelessness about the future, slowed thinking, and poor concentration and memory; the last three symptoms are seen in what is known as pseudodementia. Clinical features also differ between those with late-onset bipolar disorder and those who developed it early in life; the former group present with milder manic episodes, more prominent cognitive changes and have a background of worse psychosocial functioning, while the latter present more commonly with mixed affective episodes, and have a stronger family history of illness. Older people with bipolar disorder experience cognitive changes, particularly in executive functions such as abstract thinking and switching cognitive sets, as well as concentrating for long periods and decision-making.

== Prevention ==
Attempts at prevention of bipolar disorder have focused on stress (such as childhood adversity or highly conflictual families) which, although not a diagnostically specific causal agent for bipolar, does place genetically and biologically vulnerable individuals at risk for a more severe course of illness. Longitudinal studies have indicated that full-blown manic stages are often preceded by a variety of prodromal clinical features, providing support for the occurrence of an at-risk state of the disorder when an early intervention might prevent its further development and/or improve its outcome.

== Management ==
The aim of management is to treat acute episodes safely with medication and work with the patient in long-term maintenance to prevent further episodes and optimise function using a combination of pharmacological and psychotherapeutic techniques. Hospitalization may be required especially with the manic episodes present in bipolar I. This can be voluntary or (local legislation permitting) involuntary. Long-term inpatient stays are now less common due to deinstitutionalization, although these can still occur. Following (or in lieu of) a hospital admission, support services available can include drop-in centers, visits from members of a community mental health team or an Assertive Community Treatment team, supported employment, patient-led support groups, and intensive outpatient programs. These are sometimes referred to as partial-inpatient programs. Compared to the general population, people with bipolar disorder are less likely to frequently engage in physical exercise. Exercise may have physical and mental benefits for people with bipolar disorder, but there is a lack of research.

=== Psychosocial ===
Psychotherapy aims to assist a person with bipolar disorder in accepting and understanding their diagnosis, coping with various types of stress, improving their interpersonal relationships, and recognizing prodromal symptoms before full-blown recurrence. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), family-focused therapy, and psychoeducation have the most evidence for efficacy in regard to relapse prevention, while interpersonal and social rhythm therapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy appear the most effective in regard to residual depressive symptoms. Most studies have been based only on bipolar I, however, and treatment during the acute phase can be a particular challenge. Some clinicians emphasize the need to talk with individuals experiencing mania, to develop a therapeutic alliance in support of recovery.

=== Medication ===
Medications are often prescribed to help improve symptoms of bipolar disorder. Medications approved for treating bipolar disorder including mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and certain antidepressants. Sometimes a combination of medications may also be suggested. The choice of medications may differ depending on the bipolar disorder episode type or if the person is experiencing unipolar or bipolar depression. Other factors to consider when deciding on an appropriate treatment approach includes if the person has any comorbidities, their response to previous therapies, adverse effects, and the desire of the person to be treated.

====Mood stabilizers====
Lithium and the anticonvulsants carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and valproic acid are classed as mood stabilizers due to their effect on the mood states in bipolar disorder.
* Lithium has the best overall evidence and is considered an effective treatment for acute manic episodes, preventing relapses, and bipolar depression. Lithium reduces the risk of suicide, self-harm, and death in people with bipolar disorder. Lithium is preferred for long-term mood stabilization. Lithium treatment is also associated with adverse effects and it has been shown to erode kidney and thyroid function over extended periods.
* Valproate has become a commonly prescribed treatment and effectively treats manic episodes.
* Carbamazepine is less effective in preventing relapse than lithium or valproate. Carbamazepine effectively treats manic episodes, with some evidence it has greater benefit in rapid-cycling bipolar disorder, or those with more psychotic symptoms or more symptoms similar to that of schizoaffective disorder.
* Lamotrigine has some efficacy in treating depression, and this benefit is greatest in more severe depression. Lamotrigine may have a similar effectiveness to lithium for treating bipolar disorder, however, there is evidence to suggest that lamotrigine is less effective at preventing recurrent mania episodes. Lamotrigine treatment has been shown to be safer compared to lithium treatment, with less adverse effects.

Valproate and carbamazepine are teratogenic and should be avoided as a treatment in women of childbearing age, but discontinuation of these medications during pregnancy is associated with a high risk of relapse. Lithium is also tetratogenic in the first trimester, though it can be acceptable during this period after careful weighing of benefits and risks.

The effectiveness of topiramate is unknown. 

Mood stabilizers are used for long-term maintenance but have not demonstrated the ability to quickly treat acute bipolar depression.

====Antipsychotics====
Antipsychotic medications are effective for short-term treatment of bipolar manic episodes and appear to be superior to lithium and anticonvulsants for this purpose. Atypical antipsychotics such as lurasidone and clozapine are also indicated for bipolar depression refractory to treatment with mood stabilizers. Olanzapine is effective in preventing relapses, although the supporting evidence is weaker than the evidence for lithium. A 2006 review found that haloperidol was an effective treatment for acute mania, limited data supported no difference in overall efficacy between haloperidol, olanzapine or risperidone, and that it could be less effective than aripiprazole.

====Antidepressants====
Antidepressant monotherapy is not recommended in the treatment of bipolar disorder and does not provide any benefit over mood stabilizers. Atypical antipsychotic medications (e.g., aripiprazole) are preferred over antidepressants to augment the effects of mood stabilizers due to the lack of efficacy of antidepressants in bipolar disorder. Treatment of bipolar disorder using antidepressants may carry a risk of affective switches where a person switches from depression to manic or hypomanic phases or mixed states. There may also be a risk of accelerating cycling between phases when antidepressants are used in bipolar disorder. The risk of affective switches is higher in bipolar I depression; antidepressants are generally avoided in bipolar I disorder or only used with mood stabilizers when they are deemed necessary.

Whether modern antidepressants cause mania or cycle acceleration in bipolar disorder is highly controversial, as is whether antidepressants provide any benefit over mood stabilizers alone.
==== Combined treatment approaches ====
Antipsychotics and mood stabilizers used together are quicker and more effective at treating mania than either class of drug used alone. Some analyses indicate antipsychotics alone are also more effective at treating acute mania. A first-line treatment for depression in bipolar disorder is a combination of olanzapine and fluoxetine.

====Other drugs====
Short courses of benzodiazepines are used in addition to other medications for calming effect until mood stabilizing become effective. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effective form of treatment for acute mood disturbances in those with bipolar disorder, especially when psychotic or catatonic features are displayed. ECT is also recommended for use in pregnant women with bipolar disorder. It is unclear if ketamine (a common general dissociative anesthetic used in surgery) is useful in bipolar disorder. Gabapentin and pregabalin are not proven to be effective for treating bipolar disorder.

===Children===
Treating bipolar disorder in children involves medication and psychotherapy. The literature and research on the effects of psychosocial therapy on bipolar spectrum disorders are scarce, making it difficult to determine the efficacy of various therapies. Mood stabilizers and atypical antipsychotics are commonly prescribed. Among the former, lithium is the only compound approved by the FDA for children. Psychological treatment combines normally education on the disease, group therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy. Long-term medication is often needed.

=== Resistance to treatment ===
The poor response from some bipolar patients to treatment has given evidence to the concept of treatment-resistant bipolar disorder. Guidelines to the definition of treatment-resistant bipolar disorder and evidence-based options for its management were reviewed in 2020.

=== Management of obesity ===
A large proportion (approximately 68%) of people who seek treatment for bipolar disorder are obese or overweight and managing obesity is important for reducing the risk of other health conditions that are associated with obesity. Management approaches include non-pharmacological, pharmacological, and surgical. Examples of non-pharmacological include dietary interventions, exercise, behavioral therapies, or combined approaches. Pharmacological approaches include weight-loss medications or changing medications already being prescribed. Some people with bipolar disorder who have obesity may also be eligible for bariatric surgery. The effectiveness of these various approaches to improving or managing obesity in people with bipolar disorder is not clear.

== Prognosis ==
A lifelong condition with periods of partial or full recovery in between recurrent episodes of relapse, bipolar disorder is considered to be a major health problem worldwide because of the increased rates of disability and premature mortality. It is also associated with co-occurring psychiatric and medical problems, higher rates of death from natural causes (e.g., cardiovascular disease), and high rates of initial under- or misdiagnosis, causing a delay in appropriate treatment and contributing to poorer prognoses. When compared to the general population, people with bipolar disorder also have higher rates of other serious medical comorbidities including diabetes mellitus, respiratory diseases, HIV, and hepatitis C virus infection. After a diagnosis is made, it remains difficult to achieve complete remission of all symptoms with the currently available psychiatric medications and symptoms often become progressively more severe over time.

Compliance with medications is one of the most significant factors that can decrease the rate and severity of relapse and have a positive impact on overall prognosis. However, the types of medications used in treating BD commonly cause side effects and more than 75% of individuals with BD inconsistently take their medications for various reasons. Of the various types of the disorder, rapid cycling (four or more episodes in one year) is associated with the worst prognosis due to higher rates of self-harm and suicide. Individuals diagnosed with bipolar who have a family history of bipolar disorder are at a greater risk for more frequent manic/hypomanic episodes. Early onset and psychotic features are also associated with worse outcomes, as well as subtypes that are nonresponsive to lithium.

Early recognition and intervention also improve prognosis as the symptoms in earlier stages are less severe and more responsive to treatment. Onset after adolescence is connected to better prognoses for both genders, and being male is a protective factor against higher levels of depression. For women, better social functioning before developing bipolar disorder and being a parent are protective towards suicide attempts.

=== Functioning ===
Changes in cognitive processes and abilities are seen in mood disorders, with those of bipolar disorder being greater than those in major depressive disorder. These include reduced attentional and executive capabilities and impaired memory. People with bipolar disorder often experience a decline in cognitive functioning during (or possibly before) their first episode, after which a certain degree of cognitive dysfunction typically becomes permanent, with more severe impairment during acute phases and moderate impairment during periods of remission. As a result, two-thirds of people with BD continue to experience impaired psychosocial functioning in between episodes even when their mood symptoms are in full remission. A similar pattern is seen in both BD-I and BD-II, but people with BD-II experience a lesser degree of impairment.

When bipolar disorder occurs in children, it severely and adversely affects their psychosocial development. Children and adolescents with bipolar disorder have higher rates of significant difficulties with substance use disorders, psychosis, academic difficulties, behavioral problems, social difficulties, and legal problems. Cognitive deficits typically increase over the course of the illness. Higher degrees of impairment correlate with the number of previous manic episodes and hospitalizations, and with the presence of psychotic symptoms. Early intervention can slow the progression of cognitive impairment, while treatment at later stages can help reduce distress and negative consequences related to cognitive dysfunction.

Despite the overly ambitious goals that are frequently part of manic episodes, symptoms of mania undermine the ability to achieve these goals and often interfere with an individual&#x27;s social and occupational functioning. One-third of people with BD remain unemployed for one year following a hospitalization for mania. Depressive symptoms during and between episodes, which occur much more frequently for most people than hypomanic or manic symptoms over the course of illness, are associated with lower functional recovery in between episodes, including unemployment or underemployment for both BD-I and BD-II. However, the course of illness (duration, age of onset, number of hospitalizations, and the presence or not of rapid cycling) and cognitive performance are the best predictors of employment outcomes in individuals with bipolar disorder, followed by symptoms of depression and years of education.

=== Recovery and recurrence ===
A naturalistic study in 2003 by Tohen and coworkers from the first admission for mania or mixed episode (representing the hospitalized and therefore most severe cases) found that 50% achieved syndromal recovery (no longer meeting criteria for the diagnosis) within six weeks and 98% within two years. Within two years, 72% achieved symptomatic recovery (no symptoms at all) and 43% achieved functional recovery (regaining of prior occupational and residential status). However, 40% went on to experience a new episode of mania or depression within 2 years of syndromal recovery, and 19% switched phases without recovery.

Symptoms preceding a relapse (prodromal), especially those related to mania, can be reliably identified by people with bipolar disorder. There have been intents to teach patients coping strategies when noticing such symptoms with encouraging results.

=== Suicide ===
Bipolar disorder can cause suicidal ideation that leads to suicide attempts. Individuals whose bipolar disorder begins with a depressive or mixed affective episode seem to have a poorer prognosis and an increased risk of suicide. One out of two people with bipolar disorder attempt suicide at least once during their lifetime and many attempts are successfully completed. The annual average suicide rate is 0.4%-1.4%, which is 30 to 60 times greater than that of the general population. The number of deaths from suicide in bipolar disorder is between 18 and 25 times higher than would be expected in similarly aged people without bipolar disorder. The lifetime risk of suicide is much higher in those with bipolar disorder, with an estimated 34% of people attempting suicide and 15–20% dying by suicide.

Risk factors for suicide attempts and death from suicide in people with bipolar disorder include older age, prior suicide attempts, a depressive or mixed index episode (first episode), a manic index episode with psychotic symptoms, hopelessness or psychomotor agitation present during the episodes, co-existing anxiety disorder, a first degree relative with a mood disorder or suicide, interpersonal conflicts, occupational problems, bereavement or social isolation.

== Epidemiology ==

Bipolar disorder is the sixth leading cause of disability worldwide and has a lifetime prevalence of about 1 to 3% in the general population. However, a reanalysis of data from the National Epidemiological Catchment Area survey in the United States suggested that 0.8% of the population experience a manic episode at least once (the diagnostic threshold for bipolar I) and a further 0.5% have a hypomanic episode (the diagnostic threshold for bipolar II or cyclothymia). Including sub-threshold diagnostic criteria, such as one or two symptoms over a short time-period, an additional 5.1% of the population, adding up to a total of 6.4%, were classified as having a bipolar spectrum disorder. A more recent analysis of data from a second US National Comorbidity Survey found that 1% met lifetime prevalence criteria for bipolar I, 1.1% for bipolar II, and 2.4% for subthreshold symptoms. Estimates vary about how many children and young adults have bipolar disorder. These estimates range from 0.6 to 15% depending on differing settings, methods, and referral settings, raising suspicions of overdiagnosis. One meta-analysis of bipolar disorder in young people worldwide estimated that about 1.8% of people between the ages of seven and 21 have bipolar disorder. Similar to adults, bipolar disorder in children and adolescents is thought to occur at a similar frequency in boys and girls.

There are conceptual and methodological limitations and variations in the findings. Prevalence studies of bipolar disorder are typically carried out by lay interviewers who follow fully structured/fixed interview schemes; responses to single items from such interviews may have limited validity. In addition, diagnoses (and therefore estimates of prevalence) vary depending on whether a categorical or spectrum approach is used. This consideration has led to concerns about the potential for both underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis.

The incidence of bipolar disorder is similar in men and women as well as across different cultures and ethnic groups. A 2000 study by the World Health Organization found that prevalence and incidence of bipolar disorder are very similar across the world. Age-standardized prevalence per 100,000 ranged from 421.0 in South Asia to 481.7 in Africa and Europe for men and from 450.3 in Africa and Europe to 491.6 in Oceania for women. However, severity may differ widely across the globe. Disability-adjusted life year rates, for example, appear to be higher in developing countries, where medical coverage may be poorer and medication less available. Within the United States, Asian Americans have significantly lower rates than their African American and European American counterparts. In 2017, the Global Burden of Disease Study estimated there were 4.5 million new cases and a total of 45.5 million cases globally.

== History ==

In the early 1800s, French psychiatrist Jean-Étienne Dominique Esquirol&#x27;s lypemania, one of his affective monomanias, was the first elaboration on what was to become modern depression. The basis of the current conceptualization of bipolar illness can be traced back to the 1850s. In 1850, Jean-Pierre Falret described &quot;circular insanity&quot; (&#x27;, ); the lecture was summarized in 1851 in the &#x27; (&quot;Hospital Gazette&quot;). Three years later, in 1854, Jules-Gabriel-François Baillarger (1809–1890) described to the French Imperial Académie Nationale de Médecine a biphasic mental illness causing recurrent oscillations between mania and melancholia, which he termed (, &quot;madness in double form&quot;). Baillarger&#x27;s original paper, &quot;&quot;, appeared in the medical journal &quot;Annales médico-psychologiques&quot; (&quot;Medico-psychological annals&quot;) in 1854.

These concepts were developed by the German psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin (1856–1926), who, using Kahlbaum&#x27;s concept of cyclothymia, categorized and studied the natural course of untreated bipolar patients. He coined the term &quot;manic depressive psychosis&quot;, after noting that periods of acute illness, manic or depressive, were generally punctuated by relatively symptom-free intervals where the patient was able to function normally.

The term &quot;manic–depressive &quot;reaction&quot;&quot; appeared in the first version of the DSM in 1952, influenced by the legacy of Adolf Meyer. Subtyping into &quot;unipolar&quot; depressive disorders and bipolar disorders has its origin in Karl Kleist&#x27;s concept – since 1911 – of unipolar and bipolar affective disorders, which was used by Karl Leonhard in 1957 to differentiate between unipolar and bipolar disorder in depression. These subtypes have been regarded as separate conditions since publication of the DSM-III. The subtypes bipolar II and rapid cycling have been included since the DSM-IV, based on work from the 1970s by David Dunner, Elliot Gershon, Frederick Goodwin, Ronald Fieve, and Joseph Fleiss.
== Society and culture ==

===Cost===
The United States spent approximately $202.1 billion on people diagnosed with bipolar I disorder (excluding other subtypes of bipolar disorder and undiagnosed people) in 2015. One analysis estimated that the United Kingdom spent approximately £5.2 billion on the disorder in 2007. In addition to the economic costs, bipolar disorder is a leading cause of disability and lost productivity worldwide. People with bipolar disorder are generally more disabled, have a lower level of functioning, longer duration of illness, and increased rates of work absenteeism and decreased productivity when compared to people experiencing other mental health disorders. The decrease in the productivity seen in those who care for people with bipolar disorder also significantly contributes to these costs.

===Advocacy===
There are widespread issues with social stigma, stereotypes, and prejudice against individuals with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. In 2000, actress Carrie Fisher went public with her bipolar disorder diagnosis. She became one of the most well-recognized advocates for people with bipolar disorder in the public eye and fiercely advocated to eliminate the stigma surrounding mental illnesses, including bipolar disorder. Stephen Fried, who has written extensively on the topic, noted that Fisher helped to draw attention to the disorder&#x27;s chronicity, relapsing nature, and that bipolar disorder relapses do not indicate a lack of discipline or moral shortcomings. Since being diagnosed at age 37, actor Stephen Fry has pushed to raise awareness of the condition, with his 2006 documentary &quot;Stephen Fry: The Secret Life of the Manic Depressive&quot;. In an effort to ease the social stigma associated with bipolar disorder, the orchestra conductor Ronald Braunstein cofounded the ME/2 Orchestra with his wife Caroline Whiddon in 2011. Braunstein was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 1985 and his concerts with the ME/2 Orchestra were conceived in order to create a welcoming performance environment for his musical colleagues, while also raising public awareness about mental illness.

===Notable cases===
Numerous authors have written about bipolar disorder and many successful people have openly discussed their experience with it. Kay Redfield Jamison, a clinical psychologist and professor of psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, profiled her own bipolar disorder in her memoir &quot;An Unquiet Mind&quot; (1995). It is likely that Grigory Potemkin, Russian statesman and alleged husband of Catherine the Great, suffered from some kind of bipolar disorder. Several celebrities have also publicly shared that they have bipolar disorder; in addition to Carrie Fisher and Stephen Fry these include Catherine Zeta-Jones, Mariah Carey, Kanye West, Jane Pauley, Demi Lovato, Selena Gomez, and Russell Brand.

===Media portrayals===
Several dramatic works have portrayed characters with traits suggestive of the diagnosis which have been the subject of discussion by psychiatrists and film experts alike.

In &quot;Mr. Jones&quot; (1993), (Richard Gere) swings from a manic episode into a depressive phase and back again, spending time in a psychiatric hospital and displaying many of the features of the syndrome. In &quot;The Mosquito Coast&quot; (1986), Allie Fox (Harrison Ford) displays some features including recklessness, grandiosity, increased goal-directed activity and mood lability, as well as some paranoia. Psychiatrists have suggested that Willy Loman, the main character in Arthur Miller&#x27;s classic play &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;, has bipolar disorder.

The 2009 drama &quot;90210&quot; featured a character, Silver, who was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Stacey Slater, a character from the BBC soap &quot;EastEnders&quot;, has been diagnosed with the disorder. The storyline was developed as part of the BBC&#x27;s Headroom campaign. The Channel 4 soap &quot;Brookside&quot; had earlier featured a story about bipolar disorder when the character Jimmy Corkhill was diagnosed with the condition. 2011 Showtime&#x27;s political thriller drama &quot;Homeland&quot; protagonist Carrie Mathison has bipolar disorder, which she has kept secret since her school days. The 2014 ABC medical drama, &quot;Black Box&quot;, featured a world-renowned neuroscientist with bipolar disorder.
In the TV series &quot;Dave&quot;, the eponymous main character, played by Lil Dicky as a fictionalized version of himself, is an aspiring rapper. Lil Dicky&#x27;s real-life hype man GaTa also plays himself. In one episode, after being off his medication and having an episode, GaTa tearfully confesses to having bipolar disorder. GaTa has bipolar disorder in real life but, like his character in the show, he is able to manage it with medication.

===Creativity===

A link between mental illness and professional success or creativity has been suggested, including in accounts by Socrates, Seneca the Younger, and Cesare Lombroso. Despite prominence in popular culture, the link between creativity and bipolar has not been rigorously studied. This area of study also is likely affected by confirmation bias. Some evidence suggests that some heritable component of bipolar disorder overlaps with heritable components of creativity. Probands of people with bipolar disorder are more likely to be professionally successful, as well as to demonstrate temperamental traits similar to bipolar disorder. Furthermore, while studies of the frequency of bipolar disorder in creative population samples have been conflicting, full-blown bipolar disorder in creative samples is rare.

==Research==
Research directions for bipolar disorder in children include optimizing treatments, increasing the knowledge of the genetic and neurobiological basis of the pediatric disorder and improving diagnostic criteria. Some treatment research suggests that psychosocial interventions that involve the family, psychoeducation, and skills building (through therapies such as CBT, DBT, and IPSRT) can benefit in addition to pharmacotherapy.

<text>Burton Stephen Lancaster (November 2, 1913 – October 20, 1994) was an American actor. Initially known for playing tough guys with a tender heart, he went on to achieve success with more complex and challenging roles over a 45-year career in films and television series. He was a four-time nominee for the Academy Award for Best Actor (winning once), and he also won two BAFTA Awards and one Golden Globe Award for Best Lead Actor. The American Film Institute ranks Lancaster as of the greatest male stars of classic Hollywood cinema.

Lancaster performed as a circus acrobat in the 1930s. At the age of 32, and after serving in World War II, he landed a role in a Broadway play and drew the attention of a Hollywood agent. His breakthrough role was in the film noir &quot;The Killers&quot; in 1946 alongside Ava Gardner. A critical success, it launched both of their careers. In 1948 Lancaster starred alongside Barbara Stanwyck in the commercially and critically acclaimed film &quot;Sorry, Wrong Number&quot;, where he portrayed the husband to her bedridden invalid character. In 1953 Lancaster played the illicit lover of Deborah Kerr in the military drama &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot;. A box office smash, it won eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and landed a Best Actor nomination for Lancaster.

Later in the 1950s, he starred in &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; (1956), with Katharine Hepburn, earning a Best Actor Golden Globe nomination, and in 1957 he starred in &quot;Gunfight at the O.K. Corral&quot; (1957) with frequent co-star Kirk Douglas. During the 1950s, his production company, Hecht-Hill-Lancaster, was highly successful, with Lancaster acting in films such as: &quot;Trapeze&quot; (1956), a box office smash in which he used his acrobatic skills and for which he won the Silver Bear for Best Actor; &quot;Sweet Smell of Success&quot; (1957), a dark drama today considered a classic; &quot;Run Silent, Run Deep&quot; (1958), a WWII submarine drama with Clark Gable; and &quot;Separate Tables&quot; (1958), a hotel-set drama which received seven Oscar nominations.

In the early 1960s, Lancaster starred in a string of critically successful films, each in very disparate roles. Playing a charismatic biblical con-man in &quot;Elmer Gantry&quot; in 1960 won him the Academy Award and the Golden Globe for Best Actor. He played a Nazi war criminal in 1961 in the all-star, war-crime-trial film, &quot;Judgment at Nuremberg&quot;. Playing a bird expert prisoner in &quot;Birdman of Alcatraz&quot; in 1962, he earned the BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actor and his third Oscar nomination. In 1963, Lancaster traveled to Italy to star as an Italian prince in Visconti&#x27;s epic period drama &quot;The Leopard&quot;. In 1964, he played a US Air Force General who, opposed by a Colonel played by Douglas, tries to overthrow the President in &quot;Seven Days in May&quot;. Then, in 1966, he played an explosives expert in the western &quot;The Professionals&quot;. Although the reception of his 1968 film &quot;The Swimmer&quot; was initially lackluster upon release, in the years after it has grown in stature critically and attained a cult following.

In 1970, Lancaster starred in the box-office hit, air-disaster drama &quot;Airport&quot;. In 1974 he again starred in a Visconti film, &quot;Conversation Piece&quot;. He experienced a career resurgence in 1980 with the crime-romance &quot;Atlantic City&quot;, winning the BAFTA for Best Actor and landing his fourth Oscar nomination. Starting in the late 1970s, he also appeared in television mini-series, including the award-winning &quot;Separate but Equal&quot; with Sidney Poitier. He continued acting into his late 70s, until a stroke in 1990 forced him to retire; four years later he died from a heart attack. His final film role was in the Oscar-nominated &quot;Field of Dreams&quot;.

==Early life==

Lancaster was born on November 2, 1913, in New York City, at his parents&#x27; home at 209 East 106th Street, the son of Elizabeth (&quot;née&quot; Roberts) and mailman James Lancaster. Both of his parents were Protestants of working-class background. All four of his grandparents were Scots-Irish emigrants from the province of Ulster, Ireland. His maternal side was from Belfast, the descendants of English dissenters who had colonized Ireland as part of the Plantation of Ulster.

Lancaster grew up in East Harlem, New York City. He developed a great interest and skill in gymnastics while attending DeWitt Clinton High School, where he was a basketball star. Before he graduated from DeWitt Clinton, his mother died of a cerebral hemorrhage. Lancaster was accepted by New York University with an athletic scholarship, but dropped out.

==Circus career==

At the age of 9, Lancaster met Nick Cravat with whom he developed a lifelong partnership. Together, they learned to act in local theatre productions and circus arts at Union Settlement, one of the city&#x27;s oldest settlement houses. In the 1930s, they formed the acrobat duo &quot;Lang and Cravat&quot; and soon joined the Kay Brothers circus. However, in 1939, an injury forced Lancaster to give up the profession, with great regret. He then found temporary work, first as a salesman for Marshall Fields and then as a singing waiter in various restaurants.

==World War II service==
After the United States entered World War II, Lancaster joined the United States Army in January 1943 and performed with the Army&#x27;s 21st Special Services Division, one of the military groups organized to follow the troops on the ground and provide USO entertainment to keep up morale. He served in the Fifth Army in Italy under General Mark Clark from 1943 to 1945. He was discharged October 1945 and was an entertainment specialist with the rank of technician fifth grade.

==Acting career==
===Broadway===
Lancaster returned to New York after his Army service. Although initially unenthusiastic about acting, Lancaster was encouraged to audition for a Broadway play by a producer who saw him in an elevator while he was visiting his then-girlfriend at work. The audition was successful and Lancaster was cast in Harry Brown&#x27;s &quot;A Sound of Hunting&quot; (1945). The show only ran three weeks, but his performance attracted the interest of a Hollywood agent, Harold Hecht. Lancaster had other offers but Hecht promised him the opportunity to produce their own movies within five years of hitting Hollywood.

Through Hecht, Lancaster was brought to the attention of producer Hal B. Wallis. Lancaster left New York and moved to Los Angeles. Wallis signed him to a non-exclusive eight-movie contract.

===Hal Wallis===

Lancaster&#x27;s first filmed movie was &quot;Desert Fury&quot; for Wallis in 1947, where Lancaster was billed after John Hodiak and Lizabeth Scott. It was directed by Lewis Allen.

Then producer Mark Hellinger approached him to star in 1946&#x27;s &quot;The Killers&quot;, which was completed and released prior to &quot;Desert Fury&quot;. Directed by Robert Siodmak, it was a great commercial and critical success and launched Lancaster and his co-star Ava Gardner to stardom. It has since come to be regarded as a classic.

Hellinger used Lancaster again on &quot;Brute Force&quot; in 1947, a prison drama written by Richard Brooks and directed by Jules Dassin. It was also well received. Wallis released his films through Paramount, and so Lancaster and other Wallis contractees made cameos in &quot;Variety Girl&quot; in 1947.

Lancaster&#x27;s next film was a thriller for Wallis in 1947, &quot;I Walk Alone&quot;, co-starring Lizabeth Scott and a young Kirk Douglas, who was also under contract to Wallis. &quot;Variety&quot; listed it as one of the top grossers of the year, taking in more than $2 million.

In 1948, Lancaster had a change of pace with the film adaptation of Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;All My Sons&quot;, made at Universal Pictures with Edward G. Robinson. His third film for Wallis was an adaptation of &quot;Sorry, Wrong Number&quot; in 1948, with Barbara Stanwyck.

===Norma Productions===
Hecht kept to his promise to Lancaster to turn producer. The two of them formed a company, Norma Productions, and did a deal with Universal to make a thriller about a disturbed G.I. in London, &quot;Kiss the Blood Off My Hands&quot; in 1948, with Joan Fontaine and directed by Norman Foster. It made a profit of only $50,000, but was critically acclaimed.

Back in Hollywood, Lancaster made another film noir with Siodmak, &quot;Criss Cross&quot;, in 1949. It was originally going to be produced by Hellinger and when Hellinger died, another took over. Tony Curtis made an early appearance.

Lancaster appeared in a fourth picture for Wallis, &quot;Rope of Sand&quot;, in 1949.

Norma Productions signed a three-picture deal with Warner Bros. The first was 1950&#x27;s &quot;The Flame and the Arrow&quot;, a swashbuckler movie, in which Lancaster drew on his circus skills. Nick Cravat had a supporting role and the film was a huge commercial success, making $6 million. It was Warners&#x27; most popular film of the year and established an entirely new image for Lancaster.

Lancaster was borrowed by 20th Century Fox for &quot;Mister 880&quot; in 1950, a comedy crime romance film with Edmund Gwenn. MGM put him in a popular Western, &quot;Vengeance Valley&quot; in 1951, then he went to Warners to play the title role in the biopic &quot;Jim Thorpe – All-American&quot;, also in 1951.

===Halburt===
Norma signed a deal with Columbia Pictures to make two films through a Norma subsidiary, Halburt. The first film was 1951&#x27;s &quot;Ten Tall Men&quot;, where Lancaster was a member of the French Foreign Legion. Robert Aldrich worked on the movie as a production manager.

The second was 1952&#x27;s &quot;The First Time&quot;, a comedy which was the directorial debut of Frank Tashlin. It was meant to star Lancaster but he wound up not appearing in the filmthe first of their productions in which he did not act.

===Hecht-Lancaster Productions===
In 1951, the actor/producer duo changed the company&#x27;s name to Hecht-Lancaster Productions. The first film under the new name was another swashbuckler: 1952&#x27;s &quot;The Crimson Pirate&quot;, directed by Siodmak. Again, co-starring Nick Cravat, it was extremely popular. Taking the premise of The Flame and the Arrow a step further, it allowed the pair to, not only emphasise the absurdity of the story with more spectacle and comical situations but to demonstrate they were able to perform their own circus skills-based stunts without relying on stuntmen quite as much a most Hollywood stars. As if to down play this, Lancaster himself speaks to the audience in the opening scene over footage of Lancaster performing a dangerous rope swing from one of his pirate ship’s masts to the other. “…in a pirate world, believe only what you see.” The footage is then reversed to show a near impossible backwards swing to the first mast again, from which he proclaims “No, believe HALF of what you see.”

Lancaster changed pace once more by doing a straight dramatic part in 1952&#x27;s &quot;Come Back, Little Sheba&quot;, based on a Broadway hit, with Shirley Booth, produced by Wallis and directed by Daniel Mann.

Alternating with adventure films, he went into &quot;South Sea Woman&quot; in 1952 at Warners. Part of the Norma-Warners contract was that Lancaster had to appear in some non-Norma films, of which this was one.

In 1954, for his own company, Lancaster produced and starred in &quot;His Majesty O&#x27;Keefe&quot;, a South Sea island tale shot in Fiji. It was co-written by James Hill, who would soon become a part of the Hecht-Lancaster partnership.

===United Artists===
Hecht and Lancaster left Warners for United Artists, for what began as a two-picture deal, the first of which was to be 1954&#x27;s &quot;Apache&quot;, starring Lancaster as a Native American.

They followed it with another Western in 1954, &quot;Vera Cruz&quot;, co-starring Gary Cooper and produced by Hill. Both films were directed by Robert Aldrich and were hugely popular.

United Artists signed Hecht-Lancaster to a multi-picture contract, to make seven films over two years. These included films in which Lancaster did not act. Their first was &quot;Marty&quot; in 1955, based on Paddy Chayefsky&#x27;s TV play starring Ernest Borgnine and directed by Delbert Mann. It won both the Best Picture Oscar and the Palme d&#x27;Or award at Cannes and Borgnine an Best Actor Oscar. It also earned $2 million on a budget of $350,000. &quot;Vera Cruz&quot; had been a huge success, but &quot;Marty&quot; secured Hecht-Lancaster as one of the most successful independent production companies in Hollywood at the time. &quot;Marty&quot; star Borgnine was under contract to Hecht-Lancaster and was unhappy about his lack of upcoming roles, especially after only receiving some seven lines in 1957&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Smell of Success&quot; and half of his normal pay for &quot;Marty&quot;. He eventually sued for breach of contract to gain back some of this money in 1957.

Without Hill, Hecht and Lancaster produced &quot;The Kentuckian&quot; in 1955. It was directed by Lancaster in his directorial debut, and he also played a lead role. Lancaster disliked directing and only did it once more, on 1974&#x27;s &quot;The Midnight Man&quot;.

Lancaster still had commitments with Wallis, and made &quot;The Rose Tattoo&quot; for him in 1955, starring with Anna Magnani and Daniel Mann directing. It was very popular at the box office and critically acclaimed, winning Magnani an Oscar.

===Hecht-Hill-Lancaster===
In 1955, Hill was made an equal partner in Hecht-Lancaster, with his name added to the production company. Hecht-Hill-Lancaster (HHL) released their first film &quot;Trapeze&quot; in 1956, with Lancaster performing many of his own stunts. The film, co-starring Tony Curtis and Gina Lollobrigida, went on to become the production company&#x27;s top box office success, and United Artists expanded its deal with HHL.

In 1956, Lancaster and Hecht partnered with Loring Buzzell and entered the music industry with the music publishing companies Leigh Music, Hecht-Lancaster &amp; Buzzell Music, Calyork Music and Colby Music and the record labels Calyork Records and Maine Records.

The HHL team impressed Hollywood with its success; as &quot;Life&quot; wrote in 1957, &quot;[a]fter the independent production of a baker&#x27;s dozen of pictures, it has yet to have its first flop ... (They were also good pictures.).&quot; In late 1957, they announced they would make ten films worth $14 million in 1958.

Lancaster made two films for Wallis to complete his eight-film commitment for that contract: &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; (1956) with Katharine Hepburn, which earned Lancaster a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor; and &quot;Gunfight at the O.K. Corral&quot; (1957) with Kirk Douglas, which was a huge commercial hit directed by John Sturges.

Lancaster re-teamed with Tony Curtis in 1957 for &quot;Sweet Smell of Success&quot;, a co-production between Hecht-Hill-Lancaster and Curtis&#x27; own company with wife Janet Leigh, Curtleigh Productions. The movie, directed by Alexander Mackendrick, was a critical success but a commercial disappointment. Over the years it has come to be regarded as one of Lancaster&#x27;s greatest films.

HHL produced seven additional films in the late 1950s. Four starred Lancaster: &quot;Run Silent, Run Deep&quot; (1958), a Robert Wise directed war film with Clark Gable, which was mildly popular; &quot;Separate Tables&quot; (1958) a hotel-set drama with Kerr and Rita Hayworth (who married James Hill), which received an Oscar nomination for Best Picture and Oscar awards for lead actor David Niven and supporting actress Wendy Hiller, and was both a critical and commercial success; &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Disciple&quot; (1959), with Douglas and Laurence Olivier, which lost money (and saw Lancaster fire Mackendrick during shooting); and the Western &quot;The Unforgiven&quot; (1960), with Audrey Hepburn, which was a critical and commercial disappointment.

Three were made without Lancaster, all of which lost money: &quot;The Bachelor Party&quot; (1957), from another TV play by Chayefsky, and directed by Delbert Mann; &quot;Take a Giant Step&quot; (1959), about a black student; and &quot;Summer of the Seventeenth Doll&quot; (1960), from an Australian play, shot on location in Australia and Britain. Lancaster was originally announced as the lead for &quot;Doll&quot; but did not appear in the final film.

The Hecht-Hill-Lancaster Productions company dissolved in 1960 after Hill ruptured his relationship with both Hecht and Lancaster. Hill went on to produce a single additional film, &quot;The Happy Thieves&quot;, in a new production company, Hillworth Productions, co-owned with his wife Rita Hayworth.

===Hecht and Lancaster===

Lancaster played the title role in &quot;Elmer Gantry&quot; (1960), written and directed by Richard Brooks for United Artists. The film received five Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Actor. Lancaster won the 1960 Academy Award for Best Actor, a Golden Globe Award, and the New York Film Critics Award for his performance.

Hecht and Lancaster worked together on &quot;The Young Savages&quot; (1961), directed by John Frankenheimer and produced by Hecht. Sydney Pollack worked as a dialogue coach.

Lancaster starred in &quot;Judgment at Nuremberg&quot; (1961) for Stanley Kramer, alongside Spencer Tracy, Richard Widmark and a number of other stars. The film was both a commercial and critical success, receiving eleven Oscar nominations, including Best Picture.

He then did another film with Hecht and Frankenheimer (replacing Charles Crichton), &quot;Birdman of Alcatraz&quot; (1962), a largely fictionalized biography. In it he plays Robert Stroud, a federal prisoner incarcerated for life for two murders, who begins to collect birds and over time becomes an expert in bird diseases, even publishing a book. The film shows Stroud transferred to the maximum security Alcatraz prison where he is not allowed to keep birds and as he ages he gets married, markets bird remedies, helps stop a prison rebellion, and writes a book on the history of the U.S. penal system, but never gets paroled.

The sympathetic performance earned Lancaster a Best Actor Oscar nomination, a BAFTA Award for Best Actor, and a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor in a Dramatic Role. Hecht went on to produce five films without Lancaster&#x27;s assistance, through his company Harold Hecht Films Productions between 1961 and 1967, including another Academy Award winner, &quot;Cat Ballou&quot;, starring Lee Marvin and Jane Fonda.

===Collaborations with younger filmmakers===
Lancaster made &quot;A Child Is Waiting&quot; (1963) with Judy Garland. It was produced by Kramer and directed by John Cassavetes.

He went to Italy to star in &quot;The Leopard&quot; (1963) for Luchino Visconti, co-starring Alain Delon and Claudia Cardinale. It was one of Lancaster&#x27;s favorite films and was a big hit in France but failed in the US (though the version released was much truncated).

He had a small role in &quot;The List of Adrian Messenger&quot; (1963) for producer/star Kirk Douglas, and then did two for Frankenheimer: &quot;Seven Days in May&quot; (1964), a political thriller with Douglas, and &quot;The Train&quot; (1964), a World War Two action film (Lancaster had Frankenheimer replace Arthur Penn several days into filming).

Lancaster starred in &quot;The Hallelujah Trail&quot; (1965), a comic Western produced and directed by John Sturges which failed to recoup its large cost.

He had a big hit with &quot;The Professionals&quot; (1966), a Western directed by Brooks and also starring Lee Marvin.

In 1966, at the age of 52, Lancaster appeared nude in director Frank Perry&#x27;s film &quot;The Swimmer&quot; (1968), in what the critic Roger Ebert called &quot;his finest performance&quot;. Prior to working on &quot;The Swimmer&quot;, Lancaster was terrified of the water because he did not know how to swim. In preparation for the film, he took swimming lessons from UCLA swim coach Bob Horn. Filming was difficult and clashes between Lancaster and Perry led to Sydney Pollack coming in to do some filming. The film was not released until 1968, when it proved to be a commercial failure, though Lancaster remained proud of the movie and his performance.

===Norlan Productions===

In 1967, Lancaster formed a new partnership with Roland Kibbee, who had already worked as a writer on five Lancaster projects: &quot;Ten Tall Men&quot;, &quot;The Crimson Pirate&quot;, &quot;Three Sailors and a Girl&quot; (in which Lancaster made a cameo appearance), &quot;Vera Cruz&quot;, and &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Disciple&quot;.

Through Norlan Productions, Lancaster and Kibbee produced &quot;The Scalphunters&quot; in 1968, directed by Sydney Pollack.

Lancaster followed it with another film from Pollack, &quot;Castle Keep&quot; in 1969, which was a big flop. So was &quot;The Gypsy Moths&quot;, for Frankenheimer, also in 1969.

===1970s===

Lancaster had one of the biggest successes of his career with &quot;Airport&quot; in 1970, starring alongside Dean Martin, George Kennedy, Van Heflin, Helen Hayes, Maureen Stapleton, Barbara Hale, Jean Seberg, and Jacqueline Bisset. The Ross Hunter film received nine Academy Award nominations, including one for Best Picture. It became one of the biggest box-office hits of 1970 and, at that time, reportedly the highest-grossing film in the history of Universal Pictures.

He then went into a series of Westerns: &quot;Lawman&quot; in 1971, directed by Michael Winner; &quot;Valdez Is Coming&quot; in 1971, for Norlan; and &quot;Ulzana&#x27;s Raid&quot; in 1972, directed by Aldrich and produced by himself and Hecht. None were particularly popular but &quot;Ulzana&#x27;s Raid&quot; has become a cult film.

Lancaster did two thrillers, both 1973: &quot;Scorpio&quot; with Winner and &quot;Executive Action&quot;.

Lancaster returned to directing in 1974 with &quot;The Midnight Man&quot;, which he also wrote and produced with Kibee.

He made a second film with Visconti, &quot;Conversation Piece&quot; in 1974 and played the title role in the TV series &quot;Moses the Lawgiver&quot;, also in 1974.

Lancaster was one of many names in 1975&#x27;s &quot;1900&quot;, directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, and he had a cameo in 1976&#x27;s &quot;Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull&#x27;s History Lesson&quot; for Robert Altman.

He played Shimon Peres in the TV movie &quot;Victory at Entebbe&quot; in 1977 and had a supporting role in &quot;The Cassandra Crossing&quot; in 1976. He made a fourth and final film with Aldrich, &quot;Twilight&#x27;s Last Gleaming&quot; in 1977, and had the title role in 1977&#x27;s &quot;The Island of Dr. Moreau&quot;.

Lancaster was top-billed in &quot;Go Tell the Spartans&quot; in 1978, a Vietnam War film; Lancaster admired the script so much that he took a reduced fee and donated money to help the movie to be completed. He was in &quot;Zulu Dawn&quot; in 1979.

===1980s===
Lancaster began the 1980s with a highly acclaimed performance alongside Susan Sarandon in &quot;Atlantic City&quot; in 1980, directed by Louis Malle. The film received five Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and a Best Actor nomination for Lancaster.

He had key roles in &quot;Cattle Annie and Little Britches&quot; in 1981, &quot;The Skin&quot; in 1982 with Cardinale, &quot;Marco Polo&quot;, also in 1982, and &quot;Local Hero&quot; in 1983.

By now, Lancaster was mostly a character actor in features, as in &quot;The Osterman Weekend&quot; in 1983, but he was the lead in the TV movie &quot;Scandal Sheet&quot; in 1985.

He was in &quot;Little Treasure&quot; in 1985, directed by Alan Sharp, who had written &quot;Ulzana&#x27;s Raid&quot;; &quot;On Wings of Eagles&quot; for TV in 1986, as Bull Simons; 1986&#x27;s made for TV &quot;Barnum&quot; starred him in the title role; &quot;Tough Guys&quot; reunited him on the big screen with Kirk Douglas in 1986; &quot;Fathers and Sons: A German Tragedy&quot; (in German Väter und Söhne – Eine deutsche Tragödie) in 1986 for German TV; 1987&#x27;s &quot;Control&quot; made in Italy; &quot;Rocket Gibraltar&quot; in 1988, and &quot;The Jeweller&#x27;s Shop&quot; in 1989.

His first critical success in a while was &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; in 1989, in which he played a supporting role as Moonlight Graham. He was also in the miniseries &quot;The Betrothed&quot; in 1989.

===Later career===
Lancaster&#x27;s final performances included TV miniseries &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; (1990); &quot;Voyage of Terror: The Achille Lauro Affair&quot; (1990) as Leon Klinghoffer based on the 1985 hijacking incident; and &quot;Separate But Equal&quot; (1991) with Sidney Poitier.

===Frequent collaborators===

Lancaster appeared in a total of seventeen films produced by his agent, Harold Hecht. Eight of these were co-produced by James Hill. He also appeared in eight films produced by Hal B. Wallis and two with producer Mark Hellinger. Although Lancaster&#x27;s work alongside Kirk Douglas was known as that of a successful pair of actors, Douglas, in fact, produced four films for the pair, through his production companies Bryna Productions and Joel Productions. Roland Kibbee also produced three Lancaster films, and Lancaster was also cast in two Stanley Kramer productions.

==== Kirk Douglas ====
Kirk Douglas starred in seven films across the decades with Burt Lancaster: &quot;I Walk Alone&quot; (1948), &quot;Gunfight at the O.K. Corral&quot; (1957), &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Disciple&quot; (1959), &quot;The List of Adrian Messenger&quot; (1963), &quot;Seven Days in May&quot; (1964), &quot;Victory at Entebbe&quot; (1976) and &quot;Tough Guys&quot; (1986), which fixed the notion of the pair as something of a team in the public imagination. Douglas was always billed under Lancaster in these movies but, with the exception of &quot;I Walk Alone&quot;, in which Douglas played a villain, their roles were usually more or less the same size. Both actors arrived in Hollywood at about the same time, and first appeared together in the fourth film for each, albeit with Douglas in a supporting role. They both became actor-producers who sought out independent Hollywood careers.

==== John Frankenheimer ====
John Frankenheimer directed five films with Lancaster: &quot;The Young Savages&quot; (1961), &quot;Birdman of Alcatraz&quot; (1962), &quot;Seven Days in May&quot; (1964), &quot;The Train&quot; (1964), and &quot;The Gypsy Moths&quot; (1969).

==== Other repeat collaborators ====
He was directed four times by Robert Aldrich, three times each by Robert Siodmak and Sydney Pollack, and twice each by Byron Haskin, Daniel Mann, John Sturges, John Huston, Richard Brooks, Alexander Mackendrick, Luchino Visconti, and Michael Winner.

Roland Kibbee wrote for seven Lancaster films. Lancaster used makeup veteran Robert Schiffer in twenty credited films, hiring Schiffer on nearly all of the films he produced.

==Political activism==
Lancaster was a vocal supporter of progressive and liberal political causes. He frequently spoke out in support of racial and other minorities. As a result, he was often a target of FBI investigations. He was named in President Richard Nixon&#x27;s 1973 &quot;Enemies List&quot;.

A vocal opponent of the Vietnam War, he helped pay for the successful defense of a soldier accused of &quot;fragging&quot; (i.e., murdering) another soldier during war-time. In 1968, Lancaster actively supported the presidential candidacy of anti-war Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota, and frequently spoke on his behalf during the Democratic primaries.

Lancaster was also active in anti-death penalty activism. He campaigned heavily for George McGovern in the 1972 United States presidential election.

In 1985, Lancaster joined the fight against AIDS after fellow movie star Rock Hudson contracted the disease. Lancaster delivered Hudson&#x27;s last words at the Commitment to Life fundraiser at a time when the stigma surrounding AIDS was at its height.

Of his political opinions, frequent co-star Tony Curtis said: &quot;Here&#x27;s this great big aggressive guy that looks like a ding-dong athlete playing these big tough guys and he has the soul of—who were those first philosophers of equality?—Socrates, Plato. He was a Greek philosopher with a sense that everybody was equal.&quot;

Actor and SAG president Ed Asner said he showed everybody in Hollywood &quot;how to be a liberal with balls&quot;.

===Hollywood Ten===
In 1947, Lancaster reportedly signed a statement release by the National Council of Arts, Sciences and Professions (NCASP) asking Congress to abolish the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). He was also a member of the short-lived Committee for the First Amendment, formed in support of the Hollywood Ten. He was one of 26 movie stars who flew to Washington in October 1947 to protest against the HUAC hearings. The committee&#x27;s &quot;Hollywood Fights Back&quot; broadcasts on ABC Radio Network were two 30-minute programs that took place on October 27 and November 2, 1947, during which committee members voiced their opposition to the HUAC hearings. Many members faced blacklisting and backlash due to their involvement in the committee. Lancaster was listed in anti-communist literature as a fellow traveler.

===Civil rights movement===
He and his second wife, Norma, hosted a fundraiser for Martin Luther King Jr. and the Student Diversity Leadership Conference (SDLC) ahead of the historic March on Washington in 1963. He attended the march, where he was one of the speakers. He flew in from France for the event, where he was shooting &quot;The Train&quot;, and flew back again the next day, despite a reported fear of flying.

On August 28, 1963, at the March on Washington Lancaster &quot;read the speech that James Baldwin was supposed to make,&quot; because (as Malcolm X said in a speech delivered in Detroit at the King Solomon Baptist Church in late 1963) &quot;they wouldn&#x27;t let Baldwin get up there because they know Baldwin is liable to say anything.&quot;

===ACLU===
In 1968, Lancaster was elected to serve as chairman of the Roger Baldwin Foundation, a newly formed fund-raising arm of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California. His co-chairs were Frank Sinatra and Irving L. Lichtenstein. In October 1968, he hosted a party at his home to raise money for the ACLU to use for the defense of the more than four hundred people arrested at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Throughout the years, he remained an ardent supporter and a fundraiser for the organization.

While serving as a member of the five-person ACLU Foundation executive committee, he cast the key vote to retain Ramona Ripston as executive director of the Southern California affiliate, a position she would build into a powerful advocacy force in Los Angeles politics. Ripston later recalled: &quot;There was a feeling that a woman couldn&#x27;t run the ACLU foundation, nor have access to the books. The vote finally came down to two &#x27;yes&#x27; and two &#x27;no.&#x27; Who had the deciding vote? Burt. He had a scotch or two and finally he said, &#x27;I think she should be executive director.&#x27; I always loved him for that.&quot;

When President George H. W. Bush derided Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis as a &quot;card-carrying member of the ACLU&quot;, Lancaster was one of the supporters featured in the organization&#x27;s first television advertising campaign stating: &quot;I&#x27;m a card-carrying member of the ACLU&quot; and &quot;No one agrees with every single thing they&#x27;ve done. But no one can disagree with the guiding principle—with liberty and justice for all.&#x27;&quot; He also campaigned for Michael Dukakis in the 1988 United States presidential election.

==Personal life==
===Marriages and relationships===
Lancaster guarded his personal life and attempted to keep it private despite his stardom. He was married three times and had five children.

His first marriage was to June Ernst, a trapeze acrobat. Ernst was the daughter of a renowned female aerialist and an accomplished acrobat herself. After they were married, he performed with her family and her until their separation in the late 1930s. When they divorced is unclear. Contemporary reports listed 1940, but subsequent biographers have suggested dates as late as 1946, delaying his marriage to his second wife.

He met second wife Norma Anderson (1917–1988) when the stenographer substituted for an ill actress in a USO production for the troops in Italy. Reportedly, on seeing Lancaster in the crowd on her way to town from the airport, she turned to an officer and asked, &quot;Who is that good-looking officer and is he married?&quot; The officer set up a blind date between the two for that evening. They married in 1946. Norma was active in political causes with an entire room in their Bel Air home devoted to her major interest, the League of Woman Voters, crammed with printing presses and all the necessary supplies for mass mailings.

She was a life-long member of the NAACP. The couple held a fundraiser for Martin Luther King Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference ahead of the 1963 March on Washington. All five of his children were with Anderson: Bill (who became an actor and screenwriter), James, Susan, Joanna (who worked as a film producer), and Sighle (pronounced &quot;Sheila&quot;). It was a troubled marriage. The pair separated in 1966, and divorced in 1969.

In 1966, Lancaster began a long-term relationship with hairdresser Jackie Bone, who worked on &quot;The Professionals&quot;. The relationship was tempestuous, with Bone once smashing a wine bottle over Lancaster&#x27;s head at a dinner with Sydney Pollack and Peter Falk. Reportedly, they eventually split up after her religious conversion, which Lancaster believed he could not share with her.

His third marriage, to Susan Martin, lasted from September 1990 until his death in 1994.

According to biographer Kate Buford in &quot;Burt Lancaster: An American Life&quot;, Lancaster was devotedly loyal to his friends and family. Old friends from his childhood remained his friends for life.

====Possible affairs====
Some media outlets and authors have written that Lancaster was bisexual, and had relationships with both men and women. Friends said he claimed he was romantically involved with Deborah Kerr during the filming of &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; in 1953. However, Kerr stated that while there was a spark of attraction, nothing ever happened. He reportedly had an affair with Joan Blondell.

In her 1980 autobiography, Shelley Winters claimed to have had a two-year affair with him, during which time he was considering separation from his wife. In his Hollywood memoirs, friend Farley Granger recalled an incident when Lancaster and he had to come to Winters&#x27; rescue one evening when she had inadvertently overdosed on alcohol and sleeping pills. She broke up with him for &quot;cheating on her with his wife&quot; after she heard reports of his wife&#x27;s third or fourth pregnancy.

===Religion===
Despite his Protestant background and upbringing, Lancaster identified as an atheist later in life.

===Latter years===
As Lancaster reached his 60s, he began to be affected by cardiovascular disease. In January 1980, he had complications from a routine gall bladder operation (that he barely survived). In 1983, following two minor heart attacks, he underwent an emergency quadruple coronary bypass. He continued to act, however, and to engage in public activism. In 1988, he attended a congressional hearing in Washington, DC, with former colleagues who included James Stewart and Ginger Rogers to protest against media magnate Ted Turner&#x27;s plan to colorize various black-and-white films from the 1930s and 1940s. On November 30, 1990, when he was 77, a stroke left him partially paralyzed and largely unable to speak, ending his acting career.

==Death==

Lancaster died at his apartment in Century City, Los Angeles, after having a third heart attack at 4:50 am on October 20, 1994. His body was cremated, and his ashes were scattered under a large oak tree in Westwood Memorial Park, which is located in Westwood Village, California. A small, square ground plaque amid several others, inscribed &quot;Burt Lancaster 1913–1994&quot;, marks the location. As he had requested, no memorial or funeral service was held for him.

==Legacy==
The centennial of Lancaster&#x27;s birth was honored at New York City&#x27;s Film Society of Lincoln Center in May 2013 with the screening of 12 of the actor&#x27;s best-known films, from &quot;The Killers&quot; to &quot;Atlantic City&quot;.

Lancaster has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, at 6801 Hollywood Boulevard.

==Filmography and awards==

Lancaster was nominated for the Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role in 1954 for &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot;, in 1961 for &quot;Elmer Gantry&quot;, in 1964 for &quot;Birdman of Alcatraz&quot;, and in 1982 for &quot;Atlantic City&quot;. He won the Oscar in 1961. Lancaster&#x27;s leading role in Luchino Visconti&#x27;s 1963 canonical &quot;The Leopard&quot; began a series of roles with important European art film directors that included roles in Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s &quot;1900&quot; and Louis Malle&#x27;s &quot;Atlantic City&quot; as well as Visconti&#x27;s &quot;Conversation Piece&quot;.

===Box office ranking===
For a number of years exhibitors voted Lancaster among the most popular stars:
===In other media===
Spanish music group Hombres G released an album named &quot;La cagaste, Burt Lancaster&quot; (&quot;You messed up, Burt Lancaster&quot;) in 1986.

Thomas Hart Benton painted a scene from &quot;The Kentuckian&quot; as part of the film&#x27;s marketing. Lancaster posed for the painting, also known as &quot;The Kentuckian&quot;.

<text>The Balts or Baltic peoples (, ) are a group of peoples inhabiting the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea who speak Baltic languages. Among the Baltic peoples are modern-day Lithuanians (including Samogitians) and Latvians (including Latgalians) — all East Balts — as well as the Old Prussians, Curonians, Sudovians, Skalvians, Yotvingians and Galindians — the West Balts — whose languages and cultures are now extinct, but made a large influence on the living branches, especially on literary Lithuanian language.

The Balts are descended from a group of Proto-Indo-European tribes who settled the area between the lower Vistula and southeast shore of the Baltic Sea and upper Daugava and Dnieper rivers, and which over time became differentiated into West and East Balts. In the fifth century CE, parts of the eastern Baltic coast began to be settled by the ancestors of the Western Balts, whereas the East Balts lived in modern-day Belarus, Ukraine and Russia. In the first millennium CE, large migrations of the Balts occurred. By the 13th and 14th centuries, the East Balts shrank to the general area that the present-day Balts and Belarusians inhabit.

Baltic languages belong to the Balto-Slavic branch of the Indo-European languages. One of the features of Baltic languages is the number of conservative or archaic features retained.

==Etymology==
Medieval German chronicler Adam of Bremen in the latter part of the 11th century AD was the first writer to use the term &quot;Baltic&quot; in reference to the sea of that name. Before him various ancient places names, such as Balcia, were used in reference to a supposed island in the Baltic Sea.

In Germanic languages there was some form of the toponym East Sea until after about the year 1600, when maps in English began to label it as the Baltic Sea. By 1840, German nobles of the Governorate of Livonia adopted the term &quot;Balts&quot; to distinguish themselves from Germans of Germany. They spoke an exclusive dialect, Baltic German, which was regarded by many as the language of the Balts until 1919.

In 1845, Georg Heinrich Ferdinand Nesselmann proposed a distinct language group for Latvian, Lithuanian, and Old Prussian, which he termed Baltic. The term became prevalent after Latvia and Lithuania gained independence in 1918. Up until the early 20th century, either &quot;Latvian&quot; or &quot;Lithuanian&quot; could be used to mean the entire language family.

==History==
===Origins===

The Balts or Baltic peoples, defined as speakers of one of the Baltic languages, a branch of the Indo-European language family, are descended from a group of Indo-European tribes who settled the area between the lower Vistula and southeast shore of the Baltic Sea and upper Daugava and Dnieper rivers. The Baltic languages, especially Lithuanian, retain a number of conservative or archaic features, perhaps because the areas in which they are spoken are geographically consolidated and have low rates of immigration.

Some of the major authorities on Balts, such as Kazimieras Būga, Max Vasmer, Vladimir Toporov and Oleg Trubachyov, in conducting etymological studies of eastern European river names, were able to identify in certain regions names of specifically Baltic provenance, which most likely indicate where the Balts lived in prehistoric times. According to Vladimir Toporov and Oleg Trubachyov, the eastern boundary of the Balts in the prehistoric times were the upper reaches of the Volga, Moskva, and Oka rivers, while the southern border was the Seym river. This information is summarized and synthesized by Marija Gimbutas in &quot;The Balts&quot; (1963) to obtain a likely proto-Baltic homeland. Its borders are approximately: from a line on the Pomeranian coast eastward to include or nearly include the present-day sites of Berlin, Warsaw, Kyiv, and Kursk, northward through Moscow to the River Berzha, westward in an irregular line to the coast of the Gulf of Riga, north of Riga. 

However, other scholars such as Endre Bojt (1999) reject the presumption that there ever was such a thing as a clear, single &quot;Baltic &quot;Urheimat&quot;&quot;: &#x27;The references to the Balts at various &quot;Urheimat&quot; locations across the centuries are often of doubtful authenticity, those concerning the Balts furthest to the West are the more trustworthy among them. (...) It is wise to group the particulars of Baltic history according to the interests that moved the pens of the authors of our sources.&#x27;

===Proto-history===
The area of Baltic habitation shrank due to assimilation by other groups, and invasions. According to one of the theories which has gained considerable traction over the years, one of the western Baltic tribes, the Galindians, Galindae, or Goliad, migrated to the area around modern-day Moscow, Russia around the fourth century AD.

Over time the Balts became differentiated into West and East Balts. In the fifth century AD parts of the eastern Baltic coast began to be settled by the ancestors of the Western Balts: Brus/Prūsa (&quot;Old Prussians&quot;), Sudovians/Jotvingians, Scalvians, Nadruvians, and Curonians. The East Balts, including the hypothesised Dniepr Balts, were living in modern-day Belarus, Ukraine and Russia.

Germanic peoples lived to the west of the Baltic homelands; by the first century AD, the Goths had stabilized their kingdom from the mouth of the Vistula, south to Dacia. As Roman domination collapsed in the first half of the first millennium CE in Northern and Eastern Europe, large migrations of the Balts occurred — first, the Galindae or Galindians towards the east, and later, East Balts towards the west. In the eighth century, Slavic tribes from the Volga regions appeared. By the 13th and 14th centuries, they reached the general area that the present-day Balts and Belarusians inhabit. Many other Eastern and Southern Balts either assimilated with other Balts, or Slavs in the fourth–seventh centuries and were gradually slavicized.

===Middle Ages===

In the 12th and 13th centuries, internal struggles and invasions by Ruthenians and Poles, and later the expansion of the Teutonic Order, resulted in an almost complete annihilation of the Galindians, Curonians, and Yotvingians. Gradually, Old Prussians became Germanized or Lithuanized between the 15th and 17th centuries, especially after the Reformation in Prussia. The cultures of the Lithuanians and Latgalians/Latvians survived and became the ancestors of the populations of the modern-day countries of Latvia and Lithuania.

Old Prussian was closely related to the other extinct Western Baltic languages, Curonian, Galindian and Sudovian. It is more distantly related to the surviving Eastern Baltic languages, Lithuanian and Latvian. Compare the Prussian word &quot;seme&quot; (&quot;zemē&quot;), Latvian &quot;zeme&quot;, the Lithuanian &quot;žemė&quot; (&quot;land&quot; in English).

==Culture==
The Balts originally practiced Baltic religion. They were gradually Christianized as a result of the Northern Crusades of the Middle Ages. Baltic peoples such as the Latvians, Lithuanians and Old Prussians had their distinct mythologies. The Lithuanians have close historic ties to Poland, and many of them are Roman Catholic. The Latvians have close historic ties to Northern Germany and Scandinavia, and many of them are irreligious. In recent times, the Baltic religion has been revived in Baltic neopaganism.

==Genetics==
The Balts are included in the &quot;North European&quot; gene cluster together with the Germanic peoples, some Slavic groups (the Poles and Northern Russians) and Baltic Finnic peoples.

Saag et a. (2017) detected that the eastern Baltic in the Mesolithic was inhabited primarily by Western Hunter-Gatherers (WHGs). Their paternal haplogroups were mostly types of I2a and R1b, while their maternal haplogroups were mostly types of U5, U4 and U2. These people carried a high frequency of the derived HERC2 allele which codes for light eye color and possess an increased frequency of the derived alleles for SLC45A2 and SLC24A5, coding for lighter skin color.

Baltic hunter-gatherers still displayed a slightly larger amount of WHG ancestry than Scandinavian Hunter-Gatherers (SHGs). WHG ancestry in the Baltic was particularly high among hunter-gatherers in Latvia and Lithuania. Unlike other parts of Europe, the hunter-gatherers of the eastern Baltic do not appear to have mixed much with Early European Farmers (EEFs) arriving from Anatolia.

During the Neolithic, increasing admixture from Eastern Hunter-Gatherers (EHGs) is detected. The paternal haplogroups of EHGs was mostly types of R1a, while their maternal haplogroups appears to have been almost exclusively types of U5, U4, and U2.

The rise of the Corded Ware culture in the eastern Baltic in the Chalcolithic and Bronze Age is accompanied by a significant infusion of steppe ancestry and EEF ancestry into the eastern Baltic gene pool. In the aftermath of the Corded Ware expansion, local hunter-gatherer ancestry experienced a resurgence.

Haplogroup N reached the eastern Baltic only in the Late Bronze Age, probably with the speakers of the Uralic languages.

Modern-day Balts have a lower amount of EEF ancestry, and a higher amount of WHG ancestry, than any other population in Europe.

<text>Burnt-in timecode (often abbreviated to BITC by analogy to VITC) is a human-readable on-screen version of the timecode information for a piece of material superimposed on a video image. BITC is sometimes used in conjunction with &quot;real&quot; machine-readable timecode but more often used in copies of original material onto a nonbroadcast format such as VHS so that the VHS copies can be traced back to their master tape and the original timecodes easily located. 

Many professional VTRs can &quot;burn&quot; (overlay) the tape timecode onto one of their outputs. This output (which usually also displays the setup menu or on-screen display) is known as the &quot;super out&quot; or &quot;monitor out&quot;. The &quot;character&quot; switch or menu item turns this behaviour on or off. The &quot;character&quot; function also displays the timecode on the preview monitors in linear editing suites.

Videotapes that are recorded with timecode numbers overlaid on the video are referred to as &quot;window dubs&quot;, named after the &quot;window&quot; that displays the burnt-in timecode on-screen.

When editing was done using magnetic tapes that were subject to damage from excessive wear, it was common to use a window dub as a working copy for the majority of the editing process. Editing decisions would be made using a window dub, and no specialized equipment was needed to write down an edit decision list, which would then be replicated from the high-quality masters.

Timecode can also be superimposed on video using a dedicated overlay device, often called a &quot;window dub inserter&quot;. This inputs a video signal and its separate timecode audio signal, reads the timecode, superimposes the timecode display over the video, and outputs the combined display (usually via composite), all in real time. Stand-alone timecode generators/readers often have the window dub function built in. 

Some consumer cameras, in particular DV cameras, can &quot;burn&quot; (overlay) the tape timecode onto the composite output. This output is typically semitransparent and may include other tape information. It is usually activated by turning on the &quot;display&quot; info in one of the camera&#x27;s submenus. While not as &quot;professional&quot; as an overlay created by a professional VCR, it is a cheap alternative that is just as accurate.

Timecode is stored in the metadata areas of captured DV AVI files, and some software is able to &quot;burn&quot; (overlay) this into the video frames. For example, DVMP Pro is able to &quot;burn&quot; timecode or other items of DV metadata (such as date and time, iris, shutter speed, gain, white balance mode, etc.) into DV AVI files.

OCR techniques can be used to read BITC in situations where other forms of timecode are not available.

<doc id="4542" wikidata="Q59090" url="?curid=4542" title="Bra–ket notation">
<text>Bra–ket notation, also called Dirac notation, is a notation for linear algebra and linear operators on complex vector spaces together with their dual space both in the finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional case. It is specifically designed to ease the types of calculations that frequently come up in quantum mechanics. Its use in quantum mechanics is quite widespread.

Bra–ket notation was created by Paul Dirac in his 1939 publication &quot;A New Notation for Quantum Mechanics&quot;. The notation was introduced as an easier way to write quantum mechanical expressions. The name comes from the English word &quot;bracket&quot;.

==Quantum mechanics==
In quantum mechanics, bra–ket notation is used ubiquitously to denote quantum states. The notation uses angle brackets, and , and a vertical bar , to construct &quot;bras&quot; and &quot;kets&quot;.

A ket is of the form formula_1. Mathematically it denotes a vector, formula_2, in an abstract (complex) vector space formula_3, and physically it represents a state of some quantum system.

A bra is of the form formula_4. Mathematically it denotes a linear form formula_5, i.e. a linear map that maps each vector in formula_3 to a number in the complex plane formula_7. Letting the linear functional formula_8 act on a vector formula_9 is written as formula_10.

Assume that on formula_3 there exists an inner product formula_12 with antilinear first argument, which makes formula_3 an inner product space. Then with this inner product each vector formula_14 can be identified with a corresponding linear form, by placing the vector in the anti-linear first slot of the inner product: formula_15. The correspondence between these notations is then formula_16. The linear form formula_17 is a covector to formula_18, and the set of all covectors forms a subspace of the dual vector space formula_19, to the initial vector space formula_3. The purpose of this linear form formula_17 can now be understood in terms of making projections onto the state formula_22 to find how linearly dependent two states are, etc.

For the vector space formula_23, kets can be identified with column vectors, and bras with row vectors. Combinations of bras, kets, and linear operators are interpreted using matrix multiplication. If formula_23 has the standard Hermitian inner product formula_25, under this identification, the identification of kets and bras and vice versa provided by the inner product is taking the Hermitian conjugate (denoted formula_26).

It is common to suppress the vector or linear form from the bra–ket notation and only use a label inside the typography for the bra or ket. For example, the spin operator formula_27 on a two-dimensional space formula_28 of spinors has eigenvalues formula_29 with eigenspinors formula_30. In bra–ket notation, this is typically denoted as formula_31, and formula_32. As above, kets and bras with the same label are interpreted as kets and bras corresponding to each other using the inner product. In particular, when also identified with row and column vectors, kets and bras with the same label are identified with Hermitian conjugate column and row vectors.

Bra–ket notation was effectively established in 1939 by Paul Dirac; it is thus also known as Dirac notation, despite the notation having a precursor in Hermann Grassmann&#x27;s use of formula_33 for inner products nearly 100 years earlier.

==Vector spaces==

===Vectors vs kets===

In mathematics, the term &quot;vector&quot; is used for an element of any vector space. In physics, however, the term &quot;vector&quot; tends to refer almost exclusively to quantities like displacement or velocity, which have components that relate directly to the three dimensions of space, or relativistically, to the four of spacetime. Such vectors are typically denoted with over arrows (formula_34), boldface (formula_35) or indices (formula_36).

In quantum mechanics, a quantum state is typically represented as an element of a complex Hilbert space, for example, the infinite-dimensional vector space of all possible wavefunctions (square integrable functions mapping each point of 3D space to a complex number) or some more abstract Hilbert space constructed more algebraically. To distinguish this type of vector from those described above, it is common and useful in physics to denote an element formula_37 of an abstract complex vector space as a ket formula_18, to refer to it as a &quot;ket&quot; rather than as a vector, and to pronounce it &quot;ket-formula_37&quot; or &quot;ket-A&quot; for .

Symbols, letters, numbers, or even words—whatever serves as a convenient label—can be used as the label inside a ket, with the formula_40 making clear that the label indicates a vector in vector space. In other words, the symbol &quot; has a recognizable mathematical meaning as to the kind of variable being represented, while just the &quot; by itself does not. For example, is not necessarily equal to . Nevertheless, for convenience, there is usually some logical scheme behind the labels inside kets, such as the common practice of labeling energy eigenkets in quantum mechanics through a listing of their quantum numbers. At its simplest, the label inside the ket is the eigenvalue of a physical operator, such as formula_41, formula_42, formula_43, etc.

===Notation===

Since kets are just vectors in a Hermitian vector space, they can be manipulated using the usual rules of linear algebra. For example:

:formula_44

Note how the last line above involves infinitely many different kets, one for each real number .

Since the ket is an element of a vector space, a bra formula_45 is an element of its dual space, i.e. a bra is a linear functional which is a linear map from the vector space to the complex numbers. Thus, it is useful to think of kets and bras as being elements of different vector spaces (see below however) with both being different useful concepts.

A bra formula_17 and a ket formula_47 (i.e. a functional and a vector), can be combined to an operator formula_48 of rank one with outer product

:formula_49

===Inner product and bra–ket identification on Hilbert space===
The bra–ket notation is particularly useful in Hilbert spaces which have an inner product that allows Hermitian conjugation and identifying a vector with a continuous linear functional, i.e. a ket with a bra, and vice versa (see Riesz representation theorem). The inner product on Hilbert space formula_50 (with the first argument anti linear as preferred by physicists) is fully equivalent to an (anti-linear) identification between the space of kets and that of bras in the bra ket notation: for a vector ket formula_51 define a functional (i.e. bra) formula_52 by

:formula_53

====Bras and kets as row and column vectors====

In the simple case where we consider the vector space formula_23, a ket can be identified with a column vector, and a bra as a row vector. If, moreover, we use the standard Hermitian inner product on formula_23, the bra corresponding to a ket, in particular a bra and a ket with the same label are conjugate transpose. Moreover, conventions are set up in such a way that writing bras, kets, and linear operators next to each other simply imply matrix multiplication. In particular the outer product formula_56 of a column and a row vector ket and bra can be identified with matrix multiplication (column vector times row vector equals matrix).

For a finite-dimensional vector space, using a fixed orthonormal basis, the inner product can be written as a matrix multiplication of a row vector with a column vector:
formula_57
Based on this, the bras and kets can be defined as:
formula_58
and then it is understood that a bra next to a ket implies matrix multiplication.

The conjugate transpose (also called &quot;Hermitian conjugate&quot;) of a bra is the corresponding ket and vice versa:
formula_59
because if one starts with the bra
formula_60
then performs a complex conjugation, and then a matrix transpose, one ends up with the ket
formula_61

Writing elements of a finite dimensional (or mutatis mutandis, countably infinite) vector space as a column vector of numbers requires picking a basis. Picking a basis is not always helpful because quantum mechanics calculations involve frequently switching between different bases (e.g. position basis, momentum basis, energy eigenbasis), and one can write something like &quot; without committing to any particular basis. In situations involving two different important basis vectors, the basis vectors can be taken in the notation explicitly and here will be referred simply as &quot; and &quot;&quot;.

=== Non-normalizable states and non-Hilbert spaces ===

Bra–ket notation can be used even if the vector space is not a Hilbert space.

In quantum mechanics, it is common practice to write down kets which have infinite norm, i.e. non-normalizable wavefunctions. Examples include states whose wavefunctions are Dirac delta functions or infinite plane waves. These do not, technically, belong to the Hilbert space itself. However, the definition of &quot;Hilbert space&quot; can be broadened to accommodate these states (see the Gelfand–Naimark–Segal construction or rigged Hilbert spaces). The bra–ket notation continues to work in an analogous way in this broader context.

Banach spaces are a different generalization of Hilbert spaces. In a Banach space , the vectors may be notated by kets and the continuous linear functionals by bras. Over any vector space without topology, we may also notate the vectors by kets and the linear functionals by bras. In these more general contexts, the bracket does not have the meaning of an inner product, because the Riesz representation theorem does not apply.

==Usage in quantum mechanics==

The mathematical structure of quantum mechanics is based in large part on linear algebra:
*Wave functions and other quantum states can be represented as vectors in a complex Hilbert space. (The exact structure of this Hilbert space depends on the situation.) In bra–ket notation, for example, an electron might be in the &quot;state&quot; . (Technically, the quantum states are &quot;rays&quot; of vectors in the Hilbert space, as corresponds to the same state for any nonzero complex number .)
*Quantum superpositions can be described as vector sums of the constituent states. For example, an electron in the state is in a quantum superposition of the states and .
*Measurements are associated with linear operators (called observables) on the Hilbert space of quantum states.
*Dynamics are also described by linear operators on the Hilbert space. For example, in the Schrödinger picture, there is a linear time evolution operator with the property that if an electron is in state right now, at a later time it will be in the state , the same for every possible .
*Wave function normalization is scaling a wave function so that its norm is 1.

Since virtually every calculation in quantum mechanics involves vectors and linear operators, it can involve, and often does involve, bra–ket notation. A few examples follow:

===Spinless position–space wave function===

The Hilbert space of a spin-0 point particle is spanned by a &quot;position basis&quot; , where the label extends over the set of all points in position space. This label is the eigenvalue of the position operator acting on such a basis state, formula_62. Since there are an uncountably infinite number of vector components in the basis, this is an uncountably infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. The dimensions of the Hilbert space (usually infinite) and position space (usually 1, 2 or 3) are not to be conflated.

Starting from any ket in this Hilbert space, one may &quot;define&quot; a complex scalar function of , known as a wavefunction,
formula_63

On the left-hand side, is a function mapping any point in space to a complex number; on the right-hand side,
formula_64 
is a ket consisting of a superposition of kets with relative coefficients specified by that function.

It is then customary to define linear operators acting on wavefunctions in terms of linear operators acting on kets, by
formula_65

For instance, the momentum operator formula_66 has the following coordinate representation,
formula_67

One occasionally even encounters an expression such as formula_68, though this is something of an abuse of notation. The differential operator must be understood to be an abstract operator, acting on kets, that has the effect of differentiating wavefunctions once the expression is projected onto the position basis, formula_69
even though, in the momentum basis, this operator amounts to a mere multiplication operator (by ). That is, to say,
formula_70
or
formula_71

===Overlap of states===
In quantum mechanics the expression is typically interpreted as the probability amplitude for the state to collapse into the state . Mathematically, this means the coefficient for the projection of onto . It is also described as the projection of state onto state .

===Changing basis for a spin-1/2 particle===
A stationary spin- particle has a two-dimensional Hilbert space. One orthonormal basis is:
formula_72
where is the state with a definite value of the spin operator equal to + and is the state with a definite value of the spin operator equal to −.

Since these are a basis, &quot;any&quot; quantum state of the particle can be expressed as a linear combination (i.e., quantum superposition) of these two states:
formula_73
where and are complex numbers.

A &quot;different&quot; basis for the same Hilbert space is:
formula_74
defined in terms of rather than .

Again, &quot;any&quot; state of the particle can be expressed as a linear combination of these two:
formula_75

In vector form, you might write
formula_76
depending on which basis you are using. In other words, the &quot;coordinates&quot; of a vector depend on the basis used.

There is a mathematical relationship between formula_77, formula_78, formula_79 and formula_80; see change of basis.

==Pitfalls and ambiguous uses==

There are some conventions and uses of notation that may be confusing or ambiguous for the non-initiated or early student.

===Separation of inner product and vectors===
A cause for confusion is that the notation does not separate the inner-product operation from the notation for a (bra) vector. If a (dual space) bra-vector is constructed as a linear combination of other bra-vectors (for instance when expressing it in some basis) the notation creates some ambiguity and hides mathematical details. We can compare bra–ket notation to using bold for vectors, such as formula_81, and formula_12 for the inner product. Consider the following dual space bra-vector in the basis formula_83, where formula_84 are the complex number coefficients of formula_85:
formula_86

It has to be determined by convention if the complex numbers formula_84 are inside or outside of the inner product, and each convention gives different results.

formula_88
formula_89

===Reuse of symbols===
It is common to use the same symbol for &quot;labels&quot; and &quot;constants&quot;. For example, formula_90, where the symbol formula_91 is used simultaneously as the &quot;name of the operator&quot; formula_92, its &quot;eigenvector&quot; formula_93 and the associated &quot;eigenvalue&quot; formula_91. Sometimes the &quot;hat&quot; is also dropped for operators, and one can see notation such as formula_95.

===Hermitian conjugate of kets===
It is common to see the usage formula_96, where the dagger (formula_97) corresponds to the Hermitian conjugate. This is however not correct in a technical sense, since the ket, formula_98, represents a vector in a complex Hilbert-space formula_99, and the bra, formula_100, is a linear functional on vectors in formula_99. In other words, formula_98 is just a vector, while formula_100 is the combination of a vector and an inner product.

===Operations inside bras and kets===
This is done for a fast notation of scaling vectors. For instance, if the vector formula_104 is scaled by formula_105, it may be denoted formula_106. This can be ambiguous since formula_91 is simply a label for a state, and not a mathematical object on which operations can be performed. This usage is more common when denoting vectors as tensor products, where part of the labels are moved outside the designed slot, e.g. formula_108.

==Linear operators==
===Linear operators acting on kets===

A linear operator is a map that inputs a ket and outputs a ket. (In order to be called &quot;linear&quot;, it is required to have certain properties.) In other words, if formula_109 is a linear operator and formula_98 is a ket-vector, then formula_111 is another ket-vector.

In an formula_112-dimensional Hilbert space, we can impose a basis on the space and represent formula_98 in terms of its coordinates as a formula_114 column vector. Using the same basis for formula_109, it is represented by an formula_116 complex matrix. The ket-vector formula_111 can now be computed by matrix multiplication.

Linear operators are ubiquitous in the theory of quantum mechanics. For example, observable physical quantities are represented by self-adjoint operators, such as energy or momentum, whereas transformative processes are represented by unitary linear operators such as rotation or the progression of time.

===Linear operators acting on bras===

Operators can also be viewed as acting on bras &quot;from the right hand side&quot;. Specifically, if is a linear operator and is a bra, then is another bra defined by the rule
formula_118
(in other words, a function composition). This expression is commonly written as (cf. energy inner product)
formula_119

In an -dimensional Hilbert space, can be written as a row vector, and (as in the previous section) is an matrix. Then the bra can be computed by normal matrix multiplication.

If the same state vector appears on both bra and ket side,
formula_120
then this expression gives the expectation value, or mean or average value, of the observable represented by operator for the physical system in the state .

===Outer products===

A convenient way to define linear operators on a Hilbert space is given by the outer product: if is a bra and is a ket, the outer product
formula_121
denotes the rank-one operator with the rule 
formula_122

For a finite-dimensional vector space, the outer product can be understood as simple matrix multiplication:
formula_123
The outer product is an matrix, as expected for a linear operator.

One of the uses of the outer product is to construct projection operators. Given a ket of norm 1, the orthogonal projection onto the subspace spanned by is
formula_124
This is an idempotent in the algebra of observables that acts on the Hilbert space.

===Hermitian conjugate operator===

Just as kets and bras can be transformed into each other (making into ), the element from the dual space corresponding to is , where denotes the Hermitian conjugate (or adjoint) of the operator . In other words,
formula_125

If is expressed as an matrix, then is its conjugate transpose.

==Properties==
Bra–ket notation was designed to facilitate the formal manipulation of linear-algebraic expressions. Some of the properties that allow this manipulation are listed herein. In what follows, and denote arbitrary complex numbers, denotes the complex conjugate of , and denote arbitrary linear operators, and these properties are to hold for any choice of bras and kets.

===Linearity===
* Since bras are linear functionals, formula_126
* By the definition of addition and scalar multiplication of linear functionals in the dual space, formula_127

===Associativity===
Given any expression involving complex numbers, bras, kets, inner products, outer products, and/or linear operators (but not addition), written in bra–ket notation, the parenthetical groupings do not matter (i.e., the associative property holds). For example:
:formula_128
and so forth. The expressions on the right (with no parentheses whatsoever) are allowed to be written unambiguously &quot;because&quot; of the equalities on the left. Note that the associative property does &quot;not&quot; hold for expressions that include nonlinear operators, such as the antilinear time reversal operator in physics.

===Hermitian conjugation===
Bra–ket notation makes it particularly easy to compute the Hermitian conjugate (also called &quot;dagger&quot;, and denoted ) of expressions. The formal rules are:
* The Hermitian conjugate of a bra is the corresponding ket, and vice versa.
* The Hermitian conjugate of a complex number is its complex conjugate.
* The Hermitian conjugate of the Hermitian conjugate of anything (linear operators, bras, kets, numbers) is itself—i.e., formula_129
* Given any combination of complex numbers, bras, kets, inner products, outer products, and/or linear operators, written in bra–ket notation, its Hermitian conjugate can be computed by reversing the order of the components, and taking the Hermitian conjugate of each.

These rules are sufficient to formally write the Hermitian conjugate of any such expression; some examples are as follows:
* Kets: formula_130
* Inner products: formula_131 Note that is a scalar, so the Hermitian conjugate is just the complex conjugate, i.e., formula_132
* Matrix elements: formula_133
* Outer products: formula_134

==Composite bras and kets==
Two Hilbert spaces and may form a third space by a tensor product. In quantum mechanics, this is used for describing composite systems. If a system is composed of two subsystems described in and respectively, then the Hilbert space of the entire system is the tensor product of the two spaces. (The exception to this is if the subsystems are actually identical particles. In that case, the situation is a little more complicated.)

If is a ket in and is a ket in , the tensor product of the two kets is a ket in . This is written in various notations:
:formula_135

See quantum entanglement and the EPR paradox for applications of this product.

==The unit operator==
Consider a complete orthonormal system (&quot;basis&quot;),
formula_136
for a Hilbert space , with respect to the norm from an inner product .

From basic functional analysis, it is known that any ket formula_137 can also be written as
formula_138
with the inner product on the Hilbert space.

From the commutativity of kets with (complex) scalars, it follows that
formula_139
must be the &quot;identity operator&quot;, which sends each vector to itself.

This, then, can be inserted in any expression without affecting its value; for example
formula_140
where, in the last line, the Einstein summation convention has been used to avoid clutter.

In quantum mechanics, it often occurs that little or no information about the inner product of two arbitrary (state) kets is present, while it is still possible to say something about the expansion coefficients and of those vectors with respect to a specific (orthonormalized) basis. In this case, it is particularly useful to insert the unit operator into the bracket one time or more.

For more information, see Resolution of the identity,
formula_141 where formula_142

Since , plane waves follow, formula_143

In his book (1958), Ch. III.20, Dirac defines the &quot;standard ket&quot; which, up to a normalization, is the translationally invariant momentum eigenstate formula_144 in the momentum representation, i.e., formula_145. Consequently, the corresponding wavefunction is a constant, formula_146, and 
formula_147 as well as formula_148

Typically, when all matrix elements of an operator such as formula_149 are available, this resolution serves to reconstitute the full operator,
formula_150

== Notation used by mathematicians ==

The object physicists are considering when using bra–ket notation is a Hilbert space (a complete inner product space).

Let formula_151 be a Hilbert space and a vector in . What physicists would denote by is the vector itself. That is,
formula_152

Let be the dual space of . This is the space of linear functionals on . The embedding formula_153 is defined by formula_154, where for every the linear functional formula_155 satisfies for every the functional equation formula_156.
Notational confusion arises when identifying and with and respectively. This is because of literal symbolic substitutions. Let formula_157 and let . This gives
formula_158

One ignores the parentheses and removes the double bars.

Moreover, mathematicians usually write the dual entity not at the first place, as the physicists do, but at the second one, and they usually use not an asterisk but an overline (which the physicists reserve for averages and the Dirac spinor adjoint) to denote complex conjugate numbers; i.e., for scalar products mathematicians usually write
formula_159
whereas physicists would write for the same quantity
formula_160

<text>Blue is one of the three primary colours in the RYB colour model (traditional colour theory), as well as in the RGB (additive) colour model. It lies between violet and cyan on the spectrum of visible light. The term &quot;blue&quot; generally describes colours perceived by humans observing light with a dominant wavelength that&#x27;s between approximately 450 and 495 nanometres. Most blues contain a slight mixture of other colours; azure contains some green, while ultramarine contains some violet. The clear daytime sky and the deep sea appear blue because of an optical effect known as Rayleigh scattering. An optical effect called the Tyndall effect explains blue eyes. Distant objects appear more blue because of another optical effect called aerial perspective.

Blue has been an important colour in art and decoration since ancient times. The semi-precious stone lapis lazuli was used in ancient Egypt for jewellery and ornament and later, in the Renaissance, to make the pigment ultramarine, the most expensive of all pigments. In the eighth century Chinese artists used cobalt blue to colour fine blue and white porcelain. In the Middle Ages, European artists used it in the windows of cathedrals. Europeans wore clothing coloured with the vegetable dye woad until it was replaced by the finer indigo from America. In the 19th century, synthetic blue dyes and pigments gradually replaced organic dyes and mineral pigments. Dark blue became a common colour for military uniforms and later, in the late 20th century, for business suits. Because blue has commonly been associated with harmony, it was chosen as the colour of the flags of the United Nations and the European Union.

In the United States and Europe, blue is the colour that both men and women are most likely to choose as their favourite, with at least one recent survey showing the same across several other countries, including China, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Past surveys in the US and Europe have found that blue is the colour most commonly associated with harmony, confidence, masculinity, knowledge, intelligence, calmness, distance, infinity, the imagination, cold, and sadness.

==Etymology and linguistics==
The modern English word &quot;blue&quot; comes from Middle English or , from the Old French , a word of Germanic origin, related to the Old High German word (meaning &#x27;shimmering, lustrous&#x27;). In heraldry, the word &quot;azure&quot; is used for &quot;blue&quot;.

In Russian, Spanish, Mongolian, Irish, and some other languages, there is no single word for blue, but rather different words for light blue (, ; ) and dark blue (, ; ) (see Colour term).

Several languages, including Japanese and Lakota Sioux, use the same word to describe blue and green. For example, in Vietnamese, the colour of both tree leaves and the sky is . In Japanese, the word for blue (, ) is often used for colours that English speakers would refer to as green, such as the colour of a traffic signal meaning &quot;go&quot;. In Lakota, the word is used for both blue and green, the two colours not being distinguished in older Lakota (for more on this subject, see Blue–green distinction in language).

Linguistic research indicates that languages do not begin by having a word for the colour blue. Colour names often developed individually in natural languages, typically beginning with black and white (or dark and light), and then adding red, and only much later – usually as the last main category of colour accepted in a language – adding the colour blue, probably when blue pigments could be manufactured reliably in the culture using that language.

==Optics and colour theory==

The term &quot;blue&quot; generally describes colours perceived by humans observing light with a dominant wavelength between approximately 450 and 495 nanometres. Blues with a higher frequency and thus a shorter wavelength gradually look more violet, while those with a lower frequency and a longer wavelength gradually appear more green. Purer blues are in the middle of this range, e.g., around 470 nanometres.

Isaac Newton included blue as one of the seven colours in his first description of the visible spectrum. He chose seven colours because that was the number of notes in the musical scale, which he believed was related to the optical spectrum. He included indigo, the hue between blue and violet, as one of the separate colours, though today it is usually considered a hue of blue.

In painting and traditional colour theory, blue is one of the three primary colours of pigments (red, yellow, blue), which can be mixed to form a wide gamut of colours. Red and blue mixed together form violet, blue and yellow together form green. Mixing all three primary colours together produces a dark brown. From the Renaissance onward, painters used this system to create their colours (see RYB colour model).

The RYB model was used for colour printing by Jacob Christoph Le Blon as early as 1725. Later, printers discovered that more accurate colours could be created by using combinations of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black ink, put onto separate inked plates and then overlaid one at a time onto paper. This method could produce almost all the colours in the spectrum with reasonable accuracy.

On the HSV colour wheel, the complement of blue is yellow; that is, a colour corresponding to an equal mixture of red and green light. On a colour wheel based on traditional colour theory (RYB) where blue was considered a primary colour, its complementary colour is considered to be orange (based on the Munsell colour wheel).

===LED===
In 1993, high-brightness blue LEDs were demonstrated by Shuji Nakamura of Nichia Corporation. In parallel, Isamu Akasaki and Hiroshi Amano of Nagoya University were working on a new development which revolutionized LED lighting.

Nakamura was awarded the 2006 Millennium Technology Prize for his invention.
Nakamura, Hiroshi Amano and Isamu Akasaki were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2014 for the invention of an efficient blue LED.

===Lasers===
Lasers emitting in the blue region of the spectrum became widely available to the public in 2010 with the release of inexpensive high-powered 445–447 nm laser diode technology. Previously the blue wavelengths were accessible only through DPSS which are comparatively expensive and inefficient, but still widely used by scientists for applications including optogenetics, Raman spectroscopy, and particle image velocimetry, due to their superior beam quality. Blue gas lasers are also still commonly used for holography, DNA sequencing, optical pumping, among other scientific and medical applications.

==Shades and variations==
Blue is the colour of light between violet and cyan on the visible spectrum. Hues of blue include indigo and ultramarine, closer to violet; pure blue, without any mixture of other colours; Azure, which is a lighter shade of blue, similar to the colour of the sky; Cyan, which is midway in the spectrum between blue and green, and the other blue-greens such as turquoise, teal, and aquamarine.

Blue also varies in shade or tint; darker shades of blue contain black or grey, while lighter tints contain white. Darker shades of blue include ultramarine, cobalt blue, navy blue, and Prussian blue; while lighter tints include sky blue, azure, and Egyptian blue (for a more complete list see the List of colours).

===As a structural colour===
In nature, many blue phenomena arise from structural colouration, the result of interference between reflections from two or more surfaces of thin films, combined with refraction as light enters and exits such films. The geometry then determines that at certain angles, the light reflected from both surfaces interferes constructively, while at other angles, the light interferes destructively. Diverse colours therefore appear despite the absence of colourants.

==Colourants==


===Artificial blues===
Egyptian blue, the first artificial pigment, was produced in the third millennium BC in Ancient Egypt. It is produced by heating pulverized sand, copper, and natron. It was used in tomb paintings and funereal objects to protect the dead in their afterlife. Prior to the 1700s, blue colourants for artwork were mainly based on lapis lazuli and the related mineral ultramarine. A breakthrough occurred in 1709 when German druggist and pigment maker Johann Jacob Diesbach discovered Prussian blue. The new blue arose from experiments involving heating dried blood with iron sulphides and was initially called Berliner Blau. By 1710 it was being used by the French painter Antoine Watteau, and later his successor Nicolas Lancret. It became immensely popular for the manufacture of wallpaper, and in the 19th century was widely used by French impressionist painters. Beginning in the 1820s, Prussian blue was imported into Japan through the port of Nagasaki. It was called &quot;bero-ai&quot;, or Berlin blue, and it became popular because it did not fade like traditional Japanese blue pigment, &quot;ai-gami&quot;, made from the dayflower. Prussian blue was used by both Hokusai, in his wave paintings, and Hiroshige.

In 1799 a French chemist, Louis Jacques Thénard, made a synthetic cobalt blue pigment which became immensely popular with painters.

In 1824 the Societé pour l&#x27;Encouragement d&#x27;Industrie in France offered a prize for the invention of an artificial ultramarine which could rival the natural colour made from lapis lazuli. The prize was won in 1826 by a chemist named Jean Baptiste Guimet, but he refused to reveal the formula of his colour. In 1828, another scientist, Christian Gmelin then a professor of chemistry in Tübingen, found the process and published his formula. This was the beginning of new industry to manufacture artificial ultramarine, which eventually almost completely replaced the natural product.

In 1878 German chemists synthesized indigo. This product rapidly replaced natural indigo, wiping out vast farms growing indigo. It is now the blue of blue jeans. As the pace of organic chemistry accelerated, a succession of synthetic blue dyes were discovered including Indanthrone blue, which had even greater resistance to fading during washing or in the sun, and copper phthalocyanine.
===Dyes for textiles and food===
 Woad and true indigo were once used but since the early 1900s, all indigo is synthetic. Produced on an industrial scale, indigo is the blue of blue jeans. Blue dyes are organic compounds, both synthetic and natural.

For food, the triarylmethane dye Brilliant blue FCF is used for candies. The search continues for stable, natural blue dyes suitable for the food industry.

Various raspberry-flavoured foods are dyed blue. This was done to distinguish strawberry, watermelon and raspberry-flavoured foods. The company ICEE used Blue No. 1 for their blue raspberry ICEEs. 

=== Pigments for painting and glass ===

Blue pigments were once produced from minerals, especially lapis lazuli and its close relative ultramarine. These minerals were crushed, ground into powder, and then mixed with a quick-drying binding agent, such as egg yolk (tempera painting); or with a slow-drying oil, such as linseed oil, for oil painting. Two inorganic but synthetic blue pigments are cerulean blue (primarily cobalt(II) stanate: ) and Prussian blue (milori blue: primarily ). The chromophore in blue glass and glazes is cobalt(II). Diverse cobalt(II) salts such as cobalt carbonate or cobalt(II) aluminate are mixed with the silica prior to firing. The cobalt occupies sites otherwise filled with silicon.

===Inks===
Methyl blue is the dominant blue pigment in inks used in pens. Blueprinting involves the production of Prussian blue in situ.

===Inorganic compounds===

Certain metal ions characteristically form blue solutions or blue salts. Of some practical importance, cobalt is used to make the deep blue glazes and glasses. It substitutes for silicon or aluminum ions in these materials. Cobalt is the blue chromophore in stained glass windows, such as those in Gothic cathedrals and in Chinese porcelain beginning in the Tang dynasty. Copper(II) (Cu2+) also produces many blue compounds, including the commercial algicide copper(II) sulfate (CuSO4.5H2O). Similarly, vanadyl salts and solutions are often blue, e.g. vanadyl sulfate.

==In nature==

===Sky and sea===
When sunlight passes through the atmosphere, the blue wavelengths are scattered more widely by the oxygen and nitrogen molecules, and more blue comes to our eyes. This effect is called Rayleigh scattering, after Lord Rayleigh and confirmed by Albert Einstein in 1911.

The sea is seen as blue for largely the same reason: the water absorbs the longer wavelengths of red and reflects and scatters the blue, which comes to the eye of the viewer. The deeper the observer goes, the darker the blue becomes. In the open sea, only about 1% of light penetrates to a depth of 200 metres (see underwater and euphotic depth).

The colour of the sea is also affected by the colour of the sky, reflected by particles in the water; and by algae and plant life in the water, which can make it look green; or by sediment, which can make it look brown.

The farther away an object is, the more blue it often appears to the eye. For example, mountains in the distance often appear blue. This is the effect of atmospheric perspective; the farther an object is away from the viewer, the less contrast there is between the object and its background colour, which is usually blue. In a painting where different parts of the composition are blue, green and red, the blue will appear to be more distant, and the red closer to the viewer. The cooler a colour is, the more distant it seems. Blue light is scattered more than other wavelengths by the gases in the atmosphere, hence our &quot;blue planet&quot;.


===Minerals===

Some of the most desirable gems are blue, including sapphire and tanzanite. Compounds of copper(II) are characteristically blue and so are many copper-containing minerals.
Azurite (, with a deep blue colour, was once employed in medieval years, but it is unstable pigment, losing its colour especially under dry conditions. Lapis lazuli, mined in Afghanistan for more than three thousand years, was used for jewelry and ornaments, and later was crushed and powdered and used as a pigment. The more it was ground, the lighter the blue colour became. Natural ultramarine, made by grinding lapis lazuli into a fine powder, was the finest available blue pigment in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. It was extremely expensive, and in Italian Renaissance art, it was often reserved for the robes of the Virgin Mary.

===Plants and fungi===

Intense efforts have focused on blue flowers and the possibility that natural blue colourants could be used as food dyes. Commonly, blue colours in plants are anthocyanins: &quot;the largest group of water-soluble pigments found widespread in the plant kingdom&quot;. In the few plants that exploit structural colouration, brilliant colours are produced by structures within cells. The most brilliant blue colouration known in any living tissue is found in the marble berries of &quot;Pollia condensata&quot;, where a spiral structure of cellulose fibrils scattering blue light. The fruit of quandong (&quot;Santalum acuminatum&quot;) can appear blue owing to the same effect.

===Animals===

Blue-pigmented animals are relatively rare. Examples of which include butterflies of the genus &quot;Nessaea&quot;, where blue is created by pterobilin. Other blue pigments of animal origin include phorcabilin, used by other butterflies in &quot;Graphium&quot; and &quot;Papilio&quot; (specifically &quot;P. phorcas&quot; and &quot;P. weiskei&quot;), and sarpedobilin, which is used by &quot;Graphium sarpedon&quot;. Blue-pigmented organelles, known as &quot;cyanosomes&quot;, exist in the chromatophores of at least two fish species, the mandarin fish and the picturesque dragonet. More commonly, blueness in animals is a structural colouration; an optical interference effect induced by organized nanometre-sized scales or fibres. Examples include the plumage of several birds like the blue jay and indigo bunting, the scales of butterflies like the morpho butterfly, collagen fibres in the skin of some species of monkey and opossum, and the iridophore cells in some fish and frogs.

===Eyes===
Blue eyes do not actually contain any blue pigment. Eye colour is determined by two factors: the pigmentation of the eye&#x27;s iris and the scattering of light by the turbid medium in the stroma of the iris. In humans, the pigmentation of the iris varies from light brown to black. The appearance of blue, green, and hazel eyes results from the Tyndall scattering of light in the stroma, an optical effect similar to what accounts for the blueness of the sky. The irises of the eyes of people with blue eyes contain less dark melanin than those of people with brown eyes, which means that they absorb less short-wavelength blue light, which is instead reflected out to the viewer. Eye colour also varies depending on the lighting conditions, especially for lighter-coloured eyes.

Blue eyes are most common in Ireland, the Baltic Sea area and Northern Europe, and are also found in Eastern, Central, and Southern Europe. Blue eyes are also found in parts of Western Asia, most notably in Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, and Iran. In Estonia, 99% of people have blue eyes. In Denmark in 1978, only 8% of the population had brown eyes, though through immigration, today that number is about 11%. In Germany, about 75% have blue eyes.

In the United States, as of 2006, 1 out of every 6 people, or 16.6% of the total population, and 22.3% of the white population, have blue eyes, compared with about half of Americans born in 1900, and a third of Americans born in 1950. Blue eyes are becoming less common among American children. In the US, males are 3–5% more likely to have blue eyes than females.

== History ==
=== In the ancient world ===

As early as the 7th millennium BC, lapis lazuli was mined in the Sar-i Sang mines, in Shortugai, and in other mines in Badakhshan province in northeast Afghanistan.

Lapis lazuli artifacts, dated to 7570 BC, have been found at Bhirrana, which is the oldest site of Indus Valley civilisation. Lapis was highly valued by the Indus Valley Civilisation (7570–1900 BC). Lapis beads have been found at Neolithic burials in Mehrgarh, the Caucasus, and as far away as Mauritania. It was used in the funeral mask of Tutankhamun (1341–1323 BC).

A term for Blue was relatively rare in many forms of ancient art and decoration, and even in ancient literature. The Ancient Greek poets described the sea as green, brown or &quot;the colour of wine&quot;. The colour is mentioned several times in the Hebrew Bible as &#x27;tekhelet&#x27;. Reds, blacks, browns, and ochres are found in cave paintings from the Upper Paleolithic period, but not blue. Blue was also not used for dyeing fabric until long after red, ochre, pink, and purple. This is probably due to the perennial difficulty of making blue dyes and pigments. On the other hand, the rarity of blue pigment made it even more valuable.

The earliest known blue dyes were made from plants – woad in Europe, indigo in Asia and Africa, while blue pigments were made from minerals, usually either lapis lazuli or azurite, and required more. Blue glazes posed still another challenge since the early blue dyes and pigments were not thermally robust. In , the blue glaze Egyptian blue was introduced for ceramics, as well as many other objects. The Greeks imported indigo dye from India, calling it indikon, and they painted with Egyptian blue. Blue was not one of the four primary colours for Greek painting described by Pliny the Elder (red, yellow, black, and white). For the Romans, blue was the colour of mourning, as well as the colour of barbarians. The Celts and Germans reportedly dyed their faces blue to frighten their enemies, and tinted their hair blue when they grew old. The Romans made extensive use of indigo and Egyptian blue pigment, as evidenced, in part, by frescos in Pompeii.
The Romans had many words for varieties of blue, including , , , , , , , and , but two words, both of foreign origin, became the most enduring; , from the Germanic word &quot;blau&quot;, which eventually became &quot;bleu&quot; or blue; and , from the Arabic word , which became azure.

Blue was widely used in the decoration of churches in the Byzantine Empire. By contrast, in the Islamic world, blue was of secondary to green, believed to be the favourite colour of the Prophet Mohammed. At certain times in Moorish Spain and other parts of the Islamic world, blue was the colour worn by Christians and Jews, because only Muslims were allowed to wear white and green.

=== In the Middle Ages ===

In the art and life of Europe during the early Middle Ages, blue played a minor role. This changed dramatically between 1130 and 1140 in Paris, when the Abbe Suger rebuilt the Saint Denis Basilica. Suger considered that light was the visible manifestation of the Holy Spirit. He installed stained glass windows coloured with cobalt, which, combined with the light from the red glass, filled the church with a bluish violet light. The church became the marvel of the Christian world, and the colour became known as the . In the years that followed even more elegant blue stained glass windows were installed in other churches, including at Chartres Cathedral and Sainte-Chapelle in Paris.

In the 12th century the Roman Catholic Church dictated that painters in Italy (and the rest of Europe consequently) to paint the Virgin Mary with blue, which became associated with holiness, humility and virtue. In medieval paintings, blue was used to attract the attention of the viewer to the Virgin Mary. Paintings of the mythical King Arthur began to show him dressed in blue. The coat of arms of the kings of France became an azure or light blue shield, sprinkled with golden fleur-de-lis or lilies. Blue had come from obscurity to become the royal colour.

=== Renaissance through 18th century ===

Blue came into wider use beginning in the Renaissance, when artists began to paint the world with perspective, depth, shadows, and light from a single source. In Renaissance paintings, artists tried to create harmonies between blue and red, lightening the blue with lead white paint and adding shadows and highlights. Raphael was a master of this technique, carefully balancing the reds and the blues so no one colour dominated the picture.

Ultramarine was the most prestigious blue of the Renaissance, being more expensive than gold. Wealthy art patrons commissioned works with the most expensive blues possible. In 1616 Richard Sackville commissioned a portrait of himself by Isaac Oliver with three different blues, including ultramarine pigment for his stockings.
An industry for the manufacture of fine blue and white pottery began in the 14th century in Jingdezhen, China, using white Chinese porcelain decorated with patterns of cobalt blue, imported from Persia. It was first made for the family of the Emperor of China, then was exported around the world, with designs for export adapted to European subjects and tastes. The Chinese blue style was also adapted by Dutch craftsmen in Delft and English craftsmen in Staffordshire in the 17th-18th centuries. in the 18th century, blue and white porcelains were produced by Josiah Wedgwood and other British craftsmen.

===19th-20th century===

The early 19th century saw the ancestor of the modern blue business suit, created by Beau Brummel (1776–1840), who set fashion at the London Court. It also saw the invention of blue jeans, a highly popular form of workers&#x27;s costume, invented in 1853 by Jacob W. Davis who used metal rivets to strengthen blue denim work clothing in the California gold fields. The invention was funded by San Francisco entrepreneur Levi Strauss, and spread around the world.

Recognizing the emotional power of blue, many artists made it the central element of paintings in the 19th and 20th centuries. They included Pablo Picasso, Pavel Kuznetsov and the Blue Rose art group, and Kandinsky and Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider) school. Henri Matisse expressed deep emotions with blue, &quot;A certain blue penetrates your soul.&quot; In the second half of the 20th century, painters of the abstract expressionist movement use blues to inspire ideas and emotions. Painter Mark Rothko observed that colour was &quot;only an instrument;&quot; his interest was &quot;in expressing human emotions tragedy, ecstasy, doom, and so on&quot;.

== In society and culture ==
=== Uniforms ===

In the 17th century. The Prince-Elector of Brandenburg, Frederick William I of Prussia, chose Prussian blue as the new colour of Prussian military uniforms, because it was made with Woad, a local crop, rather than Indigo, which was produced by the colonies of Brandenburg&#x27;s rival, England. It was worn by the German army until World War I, with the exception of the soldiers of Bavaria, who wore sky-blue.

In 1748, the Royal Navy adopted a dark shade of blue for the uniform of officers. It was first known as marine blue, now known as navy blue. The militia organized by George Washington selected blue and buff, the colours of the British Whig Party. Blue continued to be the colour of the field uniform of the US Army until 1902, and is still the colour of the dress uniform.

In the 19th century, police in the United Kingdom, including the Metropolitan Police and the City of London Police also adopted a navy blue uniform. Similar traditions were embraced in France and Austria. It was also adopted at about the same time for the uniforms of the officers of the New York City Police Department.

=== Gender ===

Blue is used to represent males. Beginning as a trend the mid-19th century and applying primarily to clothing, gendered associations with blue became more widespread from the 1950s. The colour became associated with males after World War II.
===Religion===

* Blue in Judaism: In the Torah, the Israelites were commanded to put fringes, &quot;tzitzit&quot;, on the corners of their garments, and to weave within these fringes a &quot;twisted thread of blue (&quot;tekhelet&quot;)&quot;. In ancient days, this blue thread was made from a dye extracted from a Mediterranean snail called the &quot;hilazon&quot;. Maimonides claimed that this blue was the colour of &quot;the clear noonday sky&quot;; Rashi, the colour of the evening sky. According to several rabbinic sages, blue is the colour of God&#x27;s Glory. Staring at this colour aids in mediation, bringing us a glimpse of the &quot;pavement of sapphire, like the very sky for purity&quot;, which is a likeness of the Throne of God. (The Hebrew word for glory) Many items in the &quot;Mishkan&quot;, the portable sanctuary in the wilderness, such as the &quot;menorah&quot;, many of the vessels, and the Ark of the Covenant, were covered with blue cloth when transported from place to place.
* Blue in Christianity: Blue is particularly associated with the Virgin Mary. This was the result of a decree of Pope Gregory I (540–601) who ordered that all religious paintings should tell a story which was clearly comprehensible to all viewers, and that figures should be easily recognizable, especially that of the figure of Mary. If she was alone in the image, her costume was usually painted with the finest blue, ultramarine. If she was with Christ, her costume was usually painted with a less expensive pigment, to avoid outshining him.
* Blue in Hinduism: Many of the gods are depicted as having blue-coloured skin, particularly those associated with Vishnu, who is said to be the preserver of the world, and thus intimately connected to water. Krishna and Rama, Vishnu&#x27;s avatars, are usually depicted with blue skin. Shiva, the destroyer deity, is also depicted in a light-blue hue, and is called &quot;Nīlakaṇṭha&quot;, or blue-throated, for having swallowed poison to save the universe during the Samudra Manthana, the churning of the ocean of milk. Blue is used to symbolically represent the fifth, and the throat, chakra (Vishuddha).
* Blue in Sikhism: The Akali Nihangs warriors wear all-blue attire. Guru Gobind Singh also has a blue roan horse. The Sikh Rehat Maryada states that the Nishan Sahib hoisted outside every Gurudwara should be xanthic (Basanti in Punjabi) or greyish blue (modern day navy blue) (Surmaaee in Punjabi) colour.
*Blue in Paganism: Blue is associated with peace, truth, wisdom, protection, and patience. It helps with healing, psychic ability, harmony, and understanding.

=== Sports ===

In sports, blue is widely represented in uniforms in part because the majority of national teams wear the colours of their national flag. For example, the national men&#x27;s football team of France are known as &quot;Les Bleus&quot; (the Blues). Similarly, Argentina, Italy, and Uruguay wear blue shirts. The Asian Football Confederation and the Oceania Football Confederation use blue text on their logos. Blue is well represented in baseball (Blue Jays), basketball, and American football, and Ice hockey. The Indian national cricket team wears blue uniform during One day international matches, as such the team is also referred to as &quot;Men in Blue&quot;.

===Politics===

Unlike red or green, blue was not strongly associated with any particular country, religion or political movement. As the colour of harmony, it was chosen as the colour for the flags of the United Nations, the European Union, and NATO. In politics, blue is often used as the colour of conservative parties, contrasting with the red associated with left-wing parties. Some conservative parties that use the colour blue include the Conservative Party (UK), Conservative Party of Canada, Liberal Party of Australia, Liberal Party of Brazil, and Likud of Israel. However, in some countries, blue is not associated main conservative party. In the United States, the liberal Democratic Party is associated with blue, while the conservative Republican Party with red. US states which have been won by the Democratic Party in four consecutive presidential elections are termed &quot;blue states&quot;, while those that have been won by the Republican Party are termed &quot;red states&quot;. South Korea also uses this colour model, with the Democratic Party on the left using blue and the People Power Party on the right using red.

<doc id="4544" wikidata="Q181689" url="?curid=4544" title="Blind Willie McTell">
<text>Blind Willie McTell (born William Samuel McTier; May 5, 1898 – August 19, 1959) was an American Piedmont blues and ragtime singer, songwriter and guitarist. He played in a fluid, syncopated finger picking guitar style common among many East Coast, Piedmont blues players. Like his Atlanta contemporaries, he came to use twelve-string guitars exclusively. McTell was also adept at slide guitar, unusual among ragtime bluesmen. He sang in a smooth and often laid-back tenor which differed greatly from the harsher voices of many Delta bluesmen such as Charley Patton. He performed in various musical styles including blues, ragtime, religious music, and hokum and recorded more than 120 titles during fourteen recording sessions.

He was born William Samuel McTier in the Happy Valley community outside Thomson, Georgia. In his recordings of &quot;Lay Some Flowers on My Grave&quot;, &quot;Lord, Send Me an Angel&quot; and &quot;Statesboro Blues&quot;, he pronounces his surname &quot;MacTell&quot; with the stress on the first syllable. He learned to play the guitar in his early teens from his mother and from relatives and neighbors in Statesboro where his family had moved. He was a popular performer on the streets of several Georgia cities, including Augusta and Atlanta where he made his first recordings, eight songs, for Victor Records in 1927 including &quot;Statesboro Blues.&quot; . He never had a major hit record but he had a prolific recording career with different labels and under different names in the 1920s and &#x27;30s. McTell was active in the 1940s and &#x27;50s playing at house rent parties, on street corners, at fish fries, on the medicine and tent show circuit, playing on the streets of Atlanta, often with his longtime friend, Curley Weaver as well as hoboing through the South and East. He made his last recordings in 1956 at an impromptu session recorded by an Atlanta record store owner. He died three years later, having lived for years with diabetes and alcoholism. Despite his lack of commercial success, he was one of the few blues musicians of his generation who continued to actively play and record during the 1940s and &#x27;50s. He did not live to see the American folk music revival when many other bluesmen were rediscovered.

==Biography==
Most sources give the date of his birth as 1898 but researchers Bob Eagle and Eric LeBlanc suggest 1903 on the basis of his entry in the 1910 census. McTell was born blind in one eye and lost his remaining vision by late childhood. He attended schools for the blind in Georgia, New York and Michigan and showed proficiency in music from an early age, learning to read and write music in braille, first playing the harmonica and accordion and turning to the six-string guitar in his early teens. His family was rich in music; both of his parents and an uncle played the guitar and he and bluesman and gospel pioneer Thomas A. Dorsey were cousins. 

McTell&#x27;s father left the family when Willie was young. After his mother died, in the 1920s, he left his hometown and became an itinerant songster. Like Lead Belly, another songster who began his career on the streets, McTell favored the twelve-string guitar whose greater volume made it suitable for outdoor playing. In the years before World War II, McTell traveled and performed widely, recording for several labels under different names: Blind Willie McTell for Victor and Decca, Blind Sammie for Columbia, Georgia Bill for Okeh, Hot Shot Willie for Victor, Blind Willie for Vocalion and Bluebird, Barrelhouse Sammie for Atlantic, and Pig &amp; Whistle Red for Regal Records. The name &quot;Pig &amp; Whistle&quot; was a reference to a chain of barbecue restaurants in Atlanta; McTell often played for tips in the parking lot of a Pig &#x27;n Whistle restaurant. He also played behind a nearby building that later became Ray Lee&#x27;s Blue Lantern Lounge. 

McTell married Ruth Kate Williams, now better known as Kate McTell, in 1934. She accompanied him on stage and on several recordings before becoming a nurse in 1939. For most of their marriage, from 1942 until his death, they lived apart, she in Fort Gordon, near Augusta, and he working around Atlanta.

In 1940, John Lomax, a Classics professor at the University of Texas at Austin and his wife, Ruby Terrill Lomax, interviewed and recorded McTell for the Archive of American Folk Song of the Library of Congress in a two-hour session held in their hotel room in Atlanta. These recordings captured McTell&#x27;s distinctive musical style which bridges the gap between the country blues of the early part of the 20th century and the more conventionally melodious, ragtime-influenced East Coast, Piedmont blues sound. The Lomaxes also elicited from him traditional songs (such as &quot;The Boll Weevil&quot; and &quot;John Henry&quot;) and spirituals (such as &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;), which were not part of his usual repertoire. In the interview, John Lomax is heard asking if McTell knows any &quot;complaining&quot; songs (an earlier term for protest songs), to which he replies somewhat uncomfortably and evasively that he does not. The Library of Congress paid McTell $10, the equivalent of $154.56 in 2011, for this two-hour session. The material from this 1940 session was issued in 1960 as an LP and later as a CD under the somewhat misleading title &quot;The Complete Library of Congress Recordings&quot; notwithstanding the fact that it omitted some of Lomax&#x27;s interactions showing kindness to him and entirely omitting the contributions of Ruby Terrill Lomax.

Ahmet Ertegun visited Atlanta in 1949 in search of blues artists for this new Atlantic Records label and after finding McTell playing on the street, arranged a recording session. Some of the songs were released on 78 rpm discs but sold poorly. The complete session was released in 1972 as &quot;Atlanta Twelve-String&quot;. McTell recorded for Regal Records in 1949 but these recordings also met with less commercial success than his previous works. He continued to perform around Atlanta but his career was cut short by ill health, mostly due to diabetes and alcoholism. In 1956, an Atlanta record store owner, Edward Rhodes, discovered McTell playing in the street for quarters and enticed him into his store with a bottle of bourbon where he captured 13 songs on a tape recorder which Prestige Records/Bluesville Records posthumously released as his &quot;Last Session&quot;. From 1957 to 1959, McTell was a preacher at Mt. Zion Baptist Church in Atlanta.

Blind Willie McTell died of a stroke in Milledgeville, Georgia, in 1959, at the age of 61. He was buried at Jones Grove Church, near Thomson, Georgia, his birthplace. Author David Fulmer, who in 1992 was working on &quot;Blind Willie&#x27;s Blues&quot;, a documentary about McTell, arranged to have a blue marble gravestone erected on his resting place. McTell was inducted into the Blues Foundation&#x27;s Blues Hall of Fame in 1981 and the Georgia Music Hall of Fame in 1990.

==Influence==
 McTell&#x27;s influence extended over a wide variety of artists. His most famous song, &quot;Statesboro Blues&quot; was adapted by Taj Mahal with Jesse Ed Davis on slide guitar, then covered and frequently performed by the Allman Brothers Band. It also shows up on Canned Heat&#x27;s &quot;Goin&#x27; Up the Country&quot; album. A short list of some of the artists who have performed the song includes David Bromberg, Dave Van Ronk, The Devil Makes Three, Chris Smither and Ralph McTell, who changed his name because he liked the song. Ry Cooder covered McTell&#x27;s &quot;Married Man&#x27;s a Fool&quot; on his 1973 album, &quot;Paradise and Lunch&quot;. Jack White, of the White Stripes, considers McTell an influence; the White Stripes album &quot;De Stijl&quot; (2000) is dedicated to him and features a cover of his song &quot;Southern Can Is Mine&quot;. The White Stripes also covered McTell&#x27;s &quot;Lord, Send Me an Angel&quot;, releasing it as a single in 2000. In 2013, Jack White&#x27;s Third Man Records teamed up with Document Records to issue &quot;The Complete Recorded Works in Chronological Order of Charley Patton, Blind Willie McTell and the Mississippi Sheiks&quot;.

Bob Dylan paid tribute to McTell on at least four occasions. In his 1965 song &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot;, the second verse begins, &quot;Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose&quot;, an allusion to one of McTell&#x27;s many recording names (Note: there is no evidence that he used this name on any recordings). Dylan&#x27;s song &quot;Blind Willie McTell&quot; was recorded in 1983 and released in 1991 on &quot;The Bootleg Series Volumes 1-3&quot;. Dylan also recorded covers of McTell&#x27;s &quot;Broke Down Engine&quot; and &quot;Delia&quot; on his 1993 album, &quot;World Gone Wrong&quot;; Dylan&#x27;s song &quot;Po&#x27; Boy&quot;, on the album &quot;Love and Theft&quot; (2001), contains the lyric &quot;had to go to Florida dodging them Georgia laws&quot;, which comes from McTell&#x27;s &quot;Kill It Kid&quot;.

The Bath-based band Kill It Kid is named after the song of the same title.

A billiards bar and concert venue in Statesboro, Georgia, was named Blind Willie&#x27;s in the 1990s. The venue is now closed but remains a fond memory for Georgia Southern University students at the time.

Another Blind Willie&#x27;s bar in the Virginia-Highlands neighborhood of Atlanta named after McTell that features blues musicians and bands. The Blind Willie McTell Blues Festival is held annually in Thomson, Georgia.

 3. In 1996, novelist and former music journalist David Fulmer released &quot;Blind Willie&#x27;s Blues&quot;, a 53-minute documentary about McTell’s life, times, and music, with interviews with African-American history professor Daphne Duval Harrison, blues legend Taj Mahal, guitar master Stefan Grossman, Atlantic Records founder Ahmet Ertegun, McTell&#x27;s former brother-in-law Rev. A.J. Williams, and Edward Rhodes, who produced McTell&#x27;s &quot;Last Session&quot; recording. In late 2023, the film was remastered by the Southeastern Folklife Collection at Valdosta State University and is currently streaming on YouTube.

<text>BDSM is a variety of often erotic practices or roleplaying involving bondage, discipline, dominance and submission, sadomasochism, and other related interpersonal dynamics. Given the wide range of practices, some of which may be engaged in by people who do not consider themselves to be practising BDSM, inclusion in the BDSM community or subculture often is said to depend on self-identification and shared experience.

The initialism &quot;BDSM&quot; is first recorded in a Usenet post from 1991, and is interpreted as a combination of the abbreviations B/D (Bondage and Discipline), D/s (Dominance and submission), and S/M (Sadism and Masochism). &quot;BDSM&quot; is now used as a catch-all phrase covering a wide range of activities, forms of interpersonal relationships, and distinct subcultures. BDSM communities generally welcome anyone with a non-normative streak who identifies with the community; this may include cross-dressers, body modification enthusiasts, animal roleplayers, rubber fetishists, and others.

Activities and relationships in BDSM are often characterized by the participants&#x27; taking on roles that are complementary and involve inequality of power; thus, the idea of informed consent of both the partners is essential. The terms &quot;submissive&quot; and &quot;dominant&quot; are often used to distinguish these roles: the dominant partner (&quot;dom&quot;) takes psychological control over the submissive (&quot;sub&quot;). The terms &quot;top&quot; and &quot;bottom&quot; are also used; the top is the instigator of an action while the bottom is the receiver of the action. The two sets of terms are subtly different: for example, someone may choose to act as bottom to another person, for example, by being whipped, purely recreationally, without any implication of being psychologically dominated, and submissives may be ordered to massage their dominant partners. Although the bottom carries out the action and the top receives it, they have not necessarily switched roles.

The abbreviations &quot;sub&quot; and &quot;dom&quot; are frequently used instead of &quot;submissive&quot; and &quot;dominant&quot;. Sometimes the female-specific terms &quot;mistress&quot;, &quot;domme&quot;, and &quot;dominatrix&quot; are used to describe a dominant woman, instead of the sometimes gender-neutral term &quot;dom&quot;. Individuals who change between top/dominant and bottom/submissive roles—whether from relationship to relationship or within a given relationship—are called &quot;switches&quot;. The precise definition of roles and self-identification is a common subject of debate among BDSM participants.
== Fundamentals ==

&quot;BDSM&quot; is an umbrella term for certain kinds of erotic behaviour between consenting adults, encompassing various subcultures. Terms for roles vary widely among the subcultures. &quot;Top&quot; and &quot;dominant&quot; are widely used for those partner(s) in the relationship or activity who are, respectively, the physically active or controlling participants. &quot;Bottom&quot; and &quot;submissive&quot; are widely used for those partner(s) in the relationship or activity who are, respectively, the physically receptive or controlled participants. The interaction between tops and bottoms—where physical or mental control of the bottom is surrendered to the top—is sometimes known as &quot;power exchange&quot;, whether in the context of an encounter or a relationship.

BDSM actions can often take place during a specific period of time agreed to by both parties, referred to as &quot;play&quot;, a &quot;scene&quot;, or a &quot;session&quot;. Participants usually derive pleasure from this, even though many of the practices—such as inflicting pain or humiliation or being restrained—would be unpleasant under other circumstances. Explicit sexual activity, such as sexual penetration, may occur within a session, but is not essential. For legal reasons, such explicit sexual interaction is seen only rarely in public play spaces and is sometimes banned by the rules of a party or playspace. Whether it is a public &quot;playspace&quot;—ranging from a party at an established community dungeon to a hosted play &quot;zone&quot; at a nightclub or social event—the parameters of allowance can vary. Some have a policy of panties/nipple sticker for women (underwear for men) and some allow full nudity with explicit sexual acts.

The fundamental principles for the exercise of BDSM require that it be performed with the informed consent of all parties. Since the 1980s, many practitioners and organizations have adopted the motto (originally from the statement of purpose of GMSMA—a gay SM activist organization) &quot;safe, sane and consensual&quot; (&quot;SSC&quot;), which means that everything is based on safe activities, that all participants are of sufficiently sound mind to consent, and that all participants do consent. Mutual consent makes a clear legal and ethical distinction between BDSM and such crimes as sexual assault and domestic violence.

Some BDSM practitioners prefer a code of behaviour that differs from SSC. Described as &quot;risk-aware consensual kink&quot; (RACK), this code shows a preference for a style in which the &quot;individual&quot; responsibility of the involved parties is emphasized more strongly, with each participant being responsible for their own well-being. Advocates of RACK argue that SSC can hamper discussion of risk because no activity is truly &quot;safe&quot;, and that discussion of even low-risk possibilities is necessary for truly informed consent. They further argue that setting a discrete line between &quot;safe&quot; and &quot;not-safe&quot; activities ideologically denies consenting adults the right to evaluate risks versus rewards for themselves; that some adults will be drawn to certain activities regardless of the risk; and that BDSM play—particularly higher-risk play or edgeplay—should be treated with the same regard as extreme sports, with both respect and the demand that practitioners educate themselves and practice the higher-risk activities to decrease risk. RACK may be seen as focusing primarily upon awareness and informed consent, rather than accepted safe practices.

Consent is the most important criterion. The consent and compliance for a sadomasochistic situation can be granted only by people who can judge the potential results. For their consent, they must have relevant information (the extent to which the scene will go, potential risks, if a safeword will be used, what that is, and so on) at hand and the necessary mental capacity to judge. The resulting consent and understanding is occasionally summarized in a written &quot;contract&quot;, which is an agreement of what can and cannot take place.

BDSM play is usually structured such that it is possible for the consenting partner to withdraw their consent at any point during a scene; for example, by using a safeword that was agreed on in advance. Use of the agreed safeword (or occasionally a &quot;safe symbol&quot; such as dropping a ball or ringing a bell, especially when speech is restricted) is seen by some as an explicit withdrawal of consent. Failure to honor a safeword is considered serious misconduct and could constitute a crime, depending on the relevant law, since the bottom or top has explicitly revoked their consent to any actions that follow the use of the safeword. For other scenes, particularly in established relationships, a safeword may be agreed to signify a warning (&quot;this is getting too intense&quot;) rather than explicit withdrawal of consent; and a few choose not to use a safeword at all.

=== Terminology and subtypes ===
The initialism &quot;BDSM&quot; appeared for the first time in 1983 in the scientific paper &quot;S and M: Studies in Dominance and Submission&quot; by Thomas Weinberg. It was later popularized in a list of frequent questions for the site alt.sex.bondageFAQ and reposted between 1995 and 1997 in the forum soc.subculture.bondage-bdsm. It stands for:
* Bondage and discipline (&quot;B&amp;D&quot;)
* Dominance and submission (&quot;D&amp;s&quot;)
* Sadomasochism (or &quot;S&amp;M&quot;)
These terms replaced &quot;sadomasochism&quot;, as they more broadly cover BDSM activities and focus on the submissive roles instead of psychological pain. The model is only an attempt at phenomenological differentiation. Individual tastes and preferences in the area of human sexuality may overlap among these areas.

Under the initialism BDSM, these psychological and physiological facets are also included:
*Male dominance
*Male submission
*Female dominance
*Female submission

The term &quot;bondage&quot; describes the practice of physical restraint. Bondage is usually, but not always, a sexual practice. While bondage is a very popular variation within the larger field of BDSM, it is nevertheless sometimes differentiated from the rest of this field. A 2015 study of over 1,000 Canadians showed that about half of all men held fantasies of bondage, and almost half of all women did as well. In a strict sense, bondage means binding the partner by tying their appendages together; for example, by the use of handcuffs or ropes, or by lashing their arms to an object. Bondage can also be achieved by spreading the appendages and fastening them with chains or ropes to a St. Andrew&#x27;s cross or spreader bars.

The term &quot;discipline&quot; describes the use of rules and punishment to control overt behaviour. Punishment can be pain caused physically (such as caning), humiliation caused psychologically (such as a public flagellation) or loss of freedom caused physically (for example, chaining the submissive partner to the foot of a bed). Another aspect is the structured training of the bottom.

Dominance and submission (also known as &quot;D&amp;s&quot;, &quot;Ds&quot; or &quot;D/s&quot;) is a set of behaviours, customs and rituals relating to the giving and accepting of control of one individual over another in an erotic or lifestyle context. It explores the more mental aspect of BDSM. This is also the case in many relationships not considering themselves as sadomasochistic; it is considered to be a part of BDSM if it is practiced purposefully. The range of its individual characteristics is thereby wide.
Often, BDSM contracts are set out in writing to record the formal consent of the parties to the power exchange, stating their common vision of the relationship dynamic. The purpose of this kind of agreement is primarily to encourage discussion and negotiation in advance and then to document that understanding for the benefit of all parties. Such documents have not been recognized as being legally binding, nor are they intended to be. These agreements are binding in the sense that the parties have the expectation that the negotiated rules will be followed. Often other friends and community members may witness the signing of such a document in a ceremony, and so parties violating their agreement can result in loss of face, respect or status with their friends in the community.

In general, as compared to conventional relationships, BDSM participants go to greater lengths to negotiate the important aspects of their relationships in advance, and to contribute significant effort toward learning about and following safe practices.

In D/s, the dominant is the top and the submissive is the bottom. In S/M, the sadist is usually the top and the masochist the bottom, but these roles are frequently more complicated or jumbled (as in the case of being dominant, masochists who may arrange for their submissive to carry out S/M activities on them). As in B/D, the declaration of the top/bottom may be required, though sadomasochists may also play without any power exchange at all, with both partners equally in control of the play.

=== Etymology ===
The term &quot;sadomasochism&quot; is derived from the words &quot;sadism&quot; and &quot;masochism&quot;. These terms differ somewhat from the same terms used in psychology since those require that the sadism or masochism cause significant distress or involve non-consenting partners. &quot;Sadomasochism&quot; refers to the aspects of BDSM surrounding the exchange of physical or emotional pain. Sadism describes sexual pleasure derived by inflicting pain, degradation, humiliation on another person or causing another person to suffer. On the other hand, the masochist enjoys being hurt, humiliated, or suffering within the consensual scenario. Sadomasochistic scenes sometimes reach a level that appears more extreme or cruel than other forms of BDSM—for example, when a masochist is brought to tears or is severely bruised—and is occasionally unwelcome at BDSM events or parties. Sadomasochism does not imply enjoyment through causing or receiving pain in other situations (for example, accidental injury, medical procedures).

The terms &quot;sadism&quot; and &quot;masochism&quot; are derived from the names of the Marquis de Sade and Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, based on the content of the authors&#x27; works. Although the names of de Sade and Sacher-Masoch are attached to the terms sadism and masochism respectively, the scenes described in de Sade&#x27;s works do not meet modern BDSM standards of informed consent. BDSM is solely based on consensual activities, and based on its system and laws. The concepts presented by de Sade are not in accordance with the BDSM culture, even though they are sadistic in nature. In 1843, the Ruthenian physician Heinrich Kaan published &#x27; (&quot;Psychopathy of Sex&quot;), a writing in which he converts the sin conceptions of Christianity into medical diagnoses. With his work, the originally theological terms &quot;perversion&quot;, &quot;aberration&quot; and &quot;deviation&quot; became part of the scientific terminology for the first time. The German psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing introduced the terms &quot;sadism&quot; and &quot;masochism&quot; to the medical community in his work &#x27; (&quot;New research in the area of Psychopathy of Sex&quot;) in 1890.

In 1905, Sigmund Freud described sadism and masochism in his &quot;Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality&quot; as diseases developing from an incorrect development of the child psyche and laid the groundwork for the scientific perspective on the subject in the following decades. This led to the first time use of the compound term &quot;sado-masochism&quot; (German &quot;) by the Viennese psychoanalytic Isidor Isaak Sadger in their work, &quot; (&quot;Regarding the sadomasochistic complex&quot;) in 1913.

In the later 20th century, BDSM activists have protested against these conceptual models, as they were derived from the philosophies of two singular historical figures. Both Freud and Krafft-Ebing were psychiatrists; their observations on sadism and masochism were dependent on psychiatric patients, and their models were built on the assumption of psychopathology. BDSM activists argue that it is illogical to attribute human behavioural phenomena as complex as sadism and masochism to the &quot;inventions&quot; of two historic individuals. Advocates of BDSM have sought to distinguish themselves from widely held notions of antiquated psychiatric theory by the adoption of the term &quot;BDSM&quot; as a distinction from the now common usage of those psychological terms, abbreviated as &quot;S&amp;M&quot;.

== Behavioural and physiological aspects ==
BDSM is commonly mistaken as being &quot;all about pain&quot;. Freud was confounded by the complexity and counterintuitiveness of practitioners&#x27; doing things that are self-destructive and painful. Rather than pain, BDSM practitioners are primarily concerned with power, humiliation, and pleasure. The aspects of D/s and B/D may not include physical suffering at all, but include the sensations experienced by different emotions of the mind.

Of the three categories of BDSM, only sadomasochism specifically requires pain, but this is typically a means to an end, as a vehicle for feelings of humiliation, dominance, etc. In psychology, this aspect becomes a deviant behaviour once the act of inflicting or experiencing pain becomes a substitute for or the main source of sexual pleasure. In its most extreme, the preoccupation on this kind of pleasure can lead participants to view humans as insensate means of sexual gratification.

Dominance and submission of power are an entirely different experience, and are not always psychologically associated with physical pain. Many BDSM activities involve no pain or humiliation, but just the exchange of power and control. During the activities, the participants may feel endorphin effects comparable to &quot;runner&#x27;s high&quot; and to the afterglow of orgasm. The corresponding trance-like mental state is also called &quot;subspace&quot;, for the submissive, and &quot;domspace&quot;, for the dominant. Some use &quot;body stress&quot; to describe this physiological sensation. The experience of algolagnia is important, but is not the only motivation for many BDSM practitioners. The philosopher Edmund Burke called the sensation of pleasure derived from pain &quot;sublime&quot;. Couples engaging in consensual BDSM tend to show hormonal changes that indicate decreases in stress and increases in emotional bonding.

There is an array of BDSM practitioners who take part in sessions in which they do not receive any personal gratification. They enter such situations solely with the intention to allow their partners to indulge their own needs or fetishes. Professional dominants do this in exchange for money, but non-professionals do it for the sake of their partners.

In some BDSM sessions, the top exposes the bottom to a range of sensual experiences, such as pinching; biting; scratching with fingernails; erotic spanking; erotic electrostimulation; and the use of crops, whips, liquid wax, ice cubes, and Wartenberg wheels. Fixation by handcuffs, ropes, or chains may occur. The repertoire of possible &quot;toys&quot; is limited only by the imagination of both partners. To some extent, everyday items, such as clothespins, wooden spoons, and plastic wrap, are used in sex play. It is commonly considered that a pleasurable BDSM experience during a session depends strongly on the top&#x27;s competence and experience and the bottom&#x27;s physical and mental state. Trust and sexual arousal help the partners enter a shared mindset.

=== Types of play ===

Following are some of the types of BDSM play:

* Animal roleplay
* Bondage (BDSM)
* Breast torture
* Cock and ball torture
* Diaper play
* Edgeplay
* Erotic electrostimulation
* Erotic sexual denial
* Spanking
* Flogging
* Human furniture
* Japanese bondage
* Medical play
* Omorashi and bathroom use control
* Paraphilic infantilism
* Play piercing
* Predicament bondage
* Pussy torture
* Salirophilia
* Sexual roleplay
* Suspension
* Tickle torture
* Urolagnia
* Wax play
=== Safety ===

Besides safe sex, BDSM sessions often require a wider array of safety precautions than vanilla sex (sexual behaviour without BDSM elements). To ensure consent related to BDSM activity, pre-play negotiations are commonplace, especially among partners who do not know each other very well. In practice, pick-up scenes at clubs or parties may sometimes be low in negotiation (much as pick-up sex from singles bars may not involve much negotiation or disclosure). These negotiations concern the interests and fantasies of each partner and establish a framework of both acceptable and unacceptable activities. This kind of discussion is a typical &quot;unique selling proposition&quot; of BDSM sessions and quite commonplace. Additionally, safewords are often arranged to provide for an immediate stop of any activity if any participant should so desire.

Safewords are words or phrases that are called out when things are either not going as planned or have crossed a threshold one cannot handle. They are something both parties can remember and recognize and are, by definition, not words commonly used playfully during any kind of scene. Words such as &quot;no&quot;, &quot;stop&quot;, and &quot;don&#x27;t&quot;, are often inappropriate as a safeword if the roleplaying aspect includes the illusion of non-consent.

&quot;The traffic light system&quot; (TLS) is the most commonly used set of safewords.
* Red – meaning: stop immediately and check the status of your partner
* Yellow – meaning: slow down, be careful
* Green – meaning: I&#x27;m all good, we can start. If used it&#x27;s normally uttered by everyone involved before the scene can start.

At most clubs and group-organized BDSM parties and events, dungeon monitors (DMs) provide an additional safety net for the people playing there, ensuring that house rules are followed and safewords respected.

BDSM participants are expected to understand practical safety aspects, such as the potential for harm to body parts. Contusion or scarring of the skin can be a concern. Using crops, whips, or floggers, the top&#x27;s fine motor skills and anatomical knowledge can make the difference between a satisfying session for the bottom and a highly unpleasant experience that may even entail severe physical harm. The very broad range of BDSM &quot;toys&quot; and physical and psychological control techniques often requires a far-reaching knowledge of details related to the requirements of the individual session, such as anatomy, physics, and psychology. Despite these risks, BDSM activities usually result in far less severe injuries than sports like boxing and football, and BDSM practitioners do not visit emergency rooms any more often than the general population.

It is necessary to be able to identify each person&#x27;s psychological &quot;squicks&quot; or triggers in advance to avoid them. Such losses of emotional balance due to sensory or emotional overload are a fairly commonly discussed issue. It is important to follow participants&#x27; reactions empathetically and continue or stop accordingly. For some players, sparking &quot;freakouts&quot; or deliberately using triggers may be the desired outcome. Safewords are one way for BDSM practices to protect both parties. However, partners should be aware of each other&#x27;s psychological states and behaviours to prevent instances where the &quot;freakouts&quot; prevent the use of safewords.

After any BDSM activities, it is important that the participants go through sexual aftercare, to process and calm down from the activity. After the sessions, participants can need aftercare because their bodies have experienced trauma and they need to mentally come out of the role play.

== Social aspects ==
=== Types of relationships ===

;Long term
A 2003 study, the first to look at these relationships, fully demonstrated that &quot;quality long-term functioning relationships&quot; exist among practitioners of BDSM, with either sex being the top or bottom (the study was based on 17 heterosexual couples). Respondents in the study expressed their BDSM orientation to be built into who they are, but considered exploring their BDSM interests an ongoing task, and showed flexibility and adaptability in order to match their interests with their partners. The &quot;perfect match&quot; where both in the relationship shared the same tastes and desires was rare, and most relationships required both partners to take up or put away some of their desires. The BDSM activities that the couples partook in varied in sexual to nonsexual significance for the partners who reported doing certain BDSM activities for &quot;couple bonding, stress release, and spiritual quests&quot;. The most reported issue amongst respondents was not finding enough time to be in role with most adopting a lifestyle wherein both partners maintain their dominant or submissive role throughout the day.

Amongst the respondents, it was typically the bottoms who wanted to play harder, and be more restricted into their roles when there was a difference in desire to play in the relationship. The author of the study, Bert Cutler, speculated that tops may be less often in the mood to play due to the increased demand for responsibility on their part: being aware of the safety of the situation and prepared to remove the bottom from a dangerous scenario, being conscious of the desires and limits of the bottom, and so on. The author of the study stressed that successful long-term BDSM relationships came after &quot;early and thorough disclosure&quot; from both parties of their BDSM interests.

Many of those engaged in long-term BDSM relationships learned their skills from larger BDSM organizations and communities. There was a lot of discussion by the respondents on the amount of control the top possessed in the relationships but &quot;no discussion of being better, or smarter, or of more value&quot; than the bottom. Couples were generally of the same mind of whether or not they were in an ongoing relationship, but in such cases, the bottom was not locked up constantly, but that their role in the context of the relationship was always present, even when the top was doing non-dominant activities such as household chores, or the bottom being in a more dominant position. In its conclusion the study states:

The study further goes on to list three aspects that made the successful relationships work: early disclosure of interests and continued transparency, a commitment to personal growth, and the use of the dominant/submissive roles as a tool to maintain the relationship. In closing remarks, the author of the study theorizes that due to the serious potential for harm, couples in BDSM relationships develop increased communication that may be higher than in mainstream relationships.

;Professional services
A professional dominatrix or professional dominant, often referred to within the culture as a &quot;pro-dom(me)&quot;, offers services encompassing the range of bondage, discipline, and dominance in exchange for money. The term &quot;dominatrix&quot; is little-used within the non-professional BDSM scene. A non-professional dominant woman is more commonly referred to simply as a &quot;domme&quot;, &quot;dominant&quot;, or &quot;femdom&quot; (short for female dominance). Professional submissives (&quot;pro-subs&quot;), although far more rare, do exist.

=== Scenes ===
In BDSM, a &quot;scene&quot; is the stage or setting where BDSM activity takes place, as well as the activity itself. The physical place where a BDSM activity takes place is usually called a dungeon, though some prefer less dramatic terms, including &quot;playspace&quot; or &quot;club&quot;. A BDSM activity can, but need not, involve sexual activity or sexual roleplay. A characteristic of many BDSM relationships is the power exchange from the bottom to the dominant partner, and bondage features prominently in BDSM scenes and sexual roleplay.

&quot;The Scene&quot; (including use of the definite article &quot;the&quot;) is also used in the BDSM community to refer to the BDSM community as a whole. Thus someone who is on &quot;the Scene&quot;, and prepared to play in public, might take part in &quot;a scene&quot; at a public play party.

A scene can take place in private between two or more people and can involve a domestic arrangement, such as servitude or a casual or committed lifestyle master/slave relationship. BDSM elements may involve settings of slave training or punishment for breaches of instructions.

A scene can also take place in a club, where the play can be viewed by others. When a scene takes place in a public setting, it may be because the participants enjoy being watched by others, or because of the equipment available, or because having third parties present adds safety for play partners who have only recently met.

=== Etiquette ===
Most standard social etiquette rules still apply when at a BDSM event, such as not intimately touching someone you do not know, not touching someone else&#x27;s belongings (including toys), and abiding by dress codes. Many events open to the public also have rules addressing alcohol consumption, recreational drugs, cell phones, and photography.

A specific scene takes place within the general conventions and etiquette of BDSM, such as requirements for mutual consent and agreement as to the limits of any BDSM activity. This agreement can be incorporated into a formal contract. In addition, most clubs have additional rules which regulate how onlookers may interact with the actual participants in a scene. As is common in BDSM, these are founded on the catchphrase &quot;safe, sane, and consensual&quot;.

=== Parties and clubs ===
BDSM play parties are events in which BDSM practitioners and other similarly interested people meet in order to communicate, share experiences and knowledge, and to &quot;play&quot; in an erotic atmosphere. BDSM parties show similarities to ones in the dark culture, being based on a more or less strictly enforced dress code; often clothing made of latex, leather or vinyl/PVC, lycra and so on, emphasizing the body&#x27;s shape and the primary and secondary sexual characteristics. The requirement for such dress codes differ. While some events have none, others have a policy in order to create a more coherent atmosphere and to prevent outsiders from taking part.

At these parties, BDSM can be publicly performed on a stage, or more privately in separate &quot;dungeons&quot;. A reason for the relatively fast spread of this kind of event is the opportunity to use a wide range of &quot;playing equipment&quot;, which in most apartments or houses is unavailable. Slings, St. Andrew&#x27;s crosses (or similar restraining constructs), spanking benches, and punishing supports or cages are often made available. The problem of noise disturbance is also lessened at these events, while in the home setting many BDSM activities can be limited by this factor. In addition, such parties offer both exhibitionists and voyeurs a forum to indulge their inclinations without social criticism. Sexual intercourse is not permitted within most public BDSM play spaces or not often seen in others, because it is not the emphasis of this kind of play. In order to ensure the maximum safety and comfort for the participants, certain standards of behaviour have evolved; these include aspects of courtesy, privacy, respect and safewords. Today BDSM parties are taking place in most of the larger cities in the Western world.

This scene appears particularly on the Internet, in publications, and in meetings such as at fetish clubs (like Torture Garden), SM parties, gatherings called munches, and erotic fairs like Venus Berlin. The annual Folsom Street Fair held in San Francisco is the world&#x27;s largest BDSM event. It has its roots in the gay leather movement. The weekend-long festivities include a wide range of sadomasochistic erotica in a public clothing optional space between 8th and 13th streets with nightly parties associated with the organization.

There are also conventions such as Living in Leather and Black Rose.

== Psychology ==
Research indicates that there is no evidence that a preference for BDSM is a consequence of childhood abuse. Some reports suggest that people abused as children may have more BDSM injuries and have difficulty with safe words being recognized as meaning stop the previously consensual behaviour; thus, it is possible that people choosing BDSM as part of their lifestyle, who also were previously abused, may have had more police or hospital reports of injuries. In one study of three online surveys, many transgender adults remarked that BDSM influenced their individual experience of gender.

Joseph Merlino, author and psychiatry adviser to the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, said in an interview that a sadomasochistic relationship, as long as it is consensual, is not a psychological problem:
Some psychologists agree that experiences during early sexual development can have a profound effect on the character of sexuality later in life. Sadomasochistic desires, however, seem to form at a variety of ages. Some individuals report having had them before puberty, while others do not discover them until well into adulthood. According to one study, the majority of male sadomasochists (53%) developed their interest before the age of 15, while the majority of females (78%) developed their interest afterward (Breslow, Evans, and Langley 1985). The prevalence of sadomasochism within the general population is unknown. Despite female sadists being less visible than males, some surveys have resulted in comparable amounts of sadistic fantasies between females and males. The results of such studies demonstrate that one&#x27;s sex does not determine preference for sadism.

Following a phenomenological study of nine individuals involved in sexual masochistic sessions who regarded pain as central to their experience, sexual masochism was described as an addiction-like tendency, with several features resembling that of drug addiction: craving, intoxication, tolerance and withdrawal. It was also demonstrated how the first masochistic experience is placed on a pedestal, with subsequent use aiming at retrieving this lost sensation, much as described in the descriptive literature on addiction.

=== Prevalence ===
BDSM occurs among people of all genders and sexual orientations, and in varied occurrences and intensities. The spectrum ranges from couples with no connections to the subculture outside of their bedrooms or homes, without any awareness of the concept of BDSM, playing &quot;tie-me-up-games&quot;, to public scenes on St. Andrew&#x27;s crosses at large events such as the Folsom Street Fair in San Francisco. Estimation on the overall percentage of BDSM-related sexual behaviour varies.

Alfred Kinsey stated in his 1953 nonfiction book &quot;Sexual Behavior in the Human Female&quot; that 12% of females and 22% of males reported having an erotic response to a sadomasochistic story. In that book erotic responses to being bitten were given as:
A non-representative survey on the sexual behaviour of American students published in 1997 and based on questionnaires had a response rate of about 8–9%. Its results showed 15% of homosexual and bisexual males, 21% of lesbian and female bisexual students, 11% of heterosexual males and 9% of female heterosexual students committed to BDSM related fantasies. In all groups the level of practical BDSM experiences were around 6%. Within the group of openly lesbian and bisexual females, the quote was significantly higher, at 21%. Independent of their sexual orientation, about 12% of all questioned students, 16% of lesbians and female bisexuals and 8% of heterosexual males articulated an interest in spanking. Experience with this sexual behaviour was indicated by 30% of male heterosexuals, 33% of female bisexuals and lesbians, and 24% of the male gay and bisexual men and female heterosexual women. Even though this study was not considered representative, other surveys indicate similar dimensions in differing target groups.

A representative study done from 2001 to 2002 in Australia found that 1.8% of sexually active people (2.2% men, 1.3% women but no significant sex difference) had engaged in BDSM activity in the previous year. Of the entire sample, 1.8% of men and 1.3% of women had been involved in BDSM. BDSM activity was significantly more likely among bisexuals and homosexuals of both sexes. But among men in general, there was no relationship effect of age, education, language spoken at home or relationship status. Among women, in this study, activity was most common for those between 16 and 19 years of age and least likely for females over 50 years. Activity was also significantly more likely for women who had a regular partner they did not live with, but was not significantly related with speaking a language other than English or education.

Another representative study, published in 1999 by the German Institut für rationale Psychologie, found that about 2/3 of the interviewed women stated a desire to be at the mercy of their sexual partners from time to time. 69% admitted to fantasies dealing with sexual submissiveness, 42% stated interest in explicit BDSM techniques, 25% in bondage. A 1976 study in the general US population suggests three per cent have had positive experiences with Bondage or master-slave roleplaying. Overall 12% of the interviewed females and 18% of the males were willing to try it. A 1990 Kinsey Institute report stated that 5% to 10% of Americans occasionally engage in sexual activities related to BDSM, 11% of men and 17% of women reported trying bondage. Some elements of BDSM have been popularized through increased media coverage since the middle 1990s. Thus both black leather clothing, sexual jewelry such as chains and dominance roleplay appear increasingly outside of BDSM contexts.

According to yet another survey of 317,000 people in 41 countries, about 20% of the surveyed have at least used masks, blindfolds or other bondage utilities once, and 5% explicitly connected themselves with BDSM. In 2004, 19% mentioned spanking as one of their practices and 22% confirmed the use of blindfolds or handcuffs.

A 1985 study found 52 out of 182 female respondents (28%) were involved in sadomasochistic activities.

;Recent surveys
A 2009 study on two separate samples of male undergraduate students in Canada found that 62 to 65%, depending on the sample, had entertained sadistic fantasies, and 22 to 39% engaged in sadistic behaviours during sex. The figures were 62 and 52% for bondage fantasies, and 14 to 23% for bondage behaviours. A 2014 study involving a mixed sample of Canadian college students and online volunteers, both male and female, reported that 19% of male samples and 10% of female samples rated the sadistic scenarios described in a questionnaire as being at least &quot;slightly arousing&quot; on a scale that ranged from &quot;very repulsive&quot; to &quot;very arousing&quot;; the difference was statistically significant. The corresponding figures for the masochistic scenarios were 15% for male students and 17% for female students, a non-significant difference. In a 2011 study on 367 middle-aged and elderly men recruited from the broader community in Berlin, 21.8% of the men self-reported sadistic fantasies and 15.5% sadistic behaviors; 24.8% self-reported any such fantasy and/or behavior. The corresponding figures for self-reported masochism were 15.8% for fantasy, 12.3% for behaviour, and 18.5% for fantasy and/or behaviour. In a 2008 study on gay men in Puerto Rico, 14.8% of the over 425 community volunteers reported any sadistic fantasy, desire or behaviour in their lifetime; the corresponding figure for masochism was 15.7%. A 2017 cross-sectional representative survey among the general Belgian population demonstrated a substantial prevalence of BDSM fantasies and activities; 12.5% of the population performed one of more BDSM-practices on a regular basis.

Recent surveys on the spread of BDSM fantasies and practices show strong variations in the range of their results. Researchers believe that 5 to 25 per cent of the population practices sexual behaviour related to pain or dominance and submission. The population with related fantasies is believed to be even larger.

=== Medical categorization ===

Reflecting changes in social norms, modern medical opinion is now moving away from regarding BDSM activities as medical disorders, unless they are nonconsensual or involve significant distress or harm.

In 1995, Denmark became the first European Union country to have completely removed sadomasochism from its national classification of diseases. This was followed by Sweden in 2009, Norway in 2010, Finland in 2011, and Iceland in 2015.

==== DSM ====
In the past, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the American Psychiatric Association&#x27;s manual, defined some BDSM activities as sexual disorders. Following campaigns from advocacy organizations including the National Coalition for Sexual Freedom, the current version of the DSM, DSM-5, excludes consensual BDSM from diagnosis when the sexual interests cause no harm or distress.

==== ICD ====
The World Health Organization&#x27;s International Classification of Diseases (ICD) has changed in regard to BDSM in recent years.

In Europe, an organization called :de:ReviseF65 worked to remove sadomasochism from the ICD.

On 18 June 2018, the WHO (World Health Organization) published ICD-11, in which sadomasochism, together with fetishism and fetishistic transvestism (cross-dressing for sexual pleasure) are now removed as psychiatric diagnoses. Moreover, discrimination against fetish-having and BDSM individuals is considered inconsistent with human rights principles endorsed by the United Nations and The World Health Organization.

The classifications of sexual disorders reflect contemporary sexual norms and have moved from a model of pathologization or criminalization of non-reproductive sexual behaviors to a model that reflects sexual well-being and pathologizes the absence or limitation of consent in sexual relations.

=== Coming out ===


Some people who are interested in or curious about BDSM decide to come out of the closet, although many sadomasochists remain closeted. Depending upon a survey&#x27;s participants, about 5 to 25 per cent of the US population show affinity to the subject. Other than a few artists and writers, practically no celebrities are publicly known as sadomasochists.

Public knowledge of one&#x27;s BDSM lifestyle can have detrimental vocational and social effects for sadomasochists. Many face severe professional consequences or social rejection if they are exposed, either voluntarily or involuntarily, as sadomasochists.

Within feminist circles, the discussion is split roughly into two camps: some who see BDSM as an aspect or reflection of oppression (for example, Alice Schwarzer) and, on the other side, pro-BDSM feminists, often grouped under the banner of sex-positive feminism (see Samois); both of them can be traced back to the 1970s. Some feminists have criticized BDSM for eroticizing power and violence and reinforcing misogyny. They argue that women who engage in BDSM are making a choice that is ultimately bad for women. Feminist defenders of BDSM argue that consensual BDSM activities are enjoyed by many women and validate the sexual inclinations of these women. They argue that there is no connection between consensual kinky activities and sex crimes, and that feminists should not attack other women&#x27;s sexual desires as being &quot;anti-feminist&quot;. They also state that the main point of feminism is to give an individual woman free choices in her life; which includes her sexual desire. While some feminists suggest connections between consensual BDSM scenes and non-consensual rape and sexual assault, other sex-positive ones find the notion insulting to women.

Roles are not fixed to gender, but personal preferences. The dominant partner in a heterosexual relationship may be the woman rather than the man, or BDSM may be part of male/male or female/female sexual relationships. Finally, some people switch, taking either a dominant or submissive role on different occasions. Several studies investigating the possibility of a correlation between BDSM pornography and the violence against women also indicate a lack of correlation. In 1991, a lateral survey came to the conclusion that between 1964 and 1984, despite the increase in amount and availability of sadomasochistic pornography in the U.S., Germany, Denmark and Sweden, there is no correlation with the national number of rapes to be found.

Operation Spanner in the U.K. proves that BDSM practitioners still run the risk of being stigmatized as criminals. In 2003, the media coverage of Jack McGeorge showed that simply participating and working in BDSM support groups poses risks to one&#x27;s job, even in countries where no law restricts it. Here a clear difference can be seen to the situation of homosexuality. The psychological strain appearing in some individual cases is normally neither articulated nor acknowledged in public. Nevertheless, it leads to a difficult psychological situation in which the person concerned can be exposed to high levels of emotional stress.

In the stages of &quot;self-awareness&quot;, he or she realizes their desires related to BDSM scenarios or decides to be open for such. Some authors call this &quot;internal coming-out&quot;. Two separate surveys on this topic independently came to the conclusion that 58 per cent and 67 per cent of the sample respectively, had realized their disposition before their 19th birthday. Other surveys on this topic show comparable results. Independent of age, coming-out can potentially result in a difficult life crisis, sometimes leading to thoughts or acts of suicide. While homosexuals have created support networks in the last decades, sadomasochistic support networks are just starting to develop in most countries. In German-speaking countries they are only moderately more developed. The Internet is the prime contact point for support groups today, allowing for local and international networking. In the U.S., Kink Aware Professionals (KAP) a privately funded, non-profit service provides the community with referrals to psychotherapeutic, medical, and legal professionals who are knowledgeable about and sensitive to the BDSM, fetish, and leather community. In the U.S. and the U.K., the Woodhull Freedom Foundation &amp; Federation, National Coalition for Sexual Freedom (NCSF) and Sexual Freedom Coalition (SFC) have emerged to represent the interests of sadomasochists. The German Bundesvereinigung Sadomasochismus is committed to the same aim of providing information and driving press relations. In 1996, the website and mailing list Datenschlag went online in German and English providing the largest bibliography, as well as one of the most extensive historical collections of sources related to BDSM.

=== Social (non-medical) research ===
Richters et al. (2008) found that people who engaged in BDSM were more likely to have experienced a wider range of sexual practices (e.g., oral or anal sex, more than one partner, group sex, phone sex, viewed pornography, used a sex toy, fisting, etc.). They were, however, not any more likely to have been coerced, unhappy, anxious, or experiencing sexual difficulties. On the contrary, men who had engaged in BDSM scored lower on a psychological distress scale than men who did not.

There have been few studies on the psychological aspects of BDSM using modern scientific standards. Psychotherapist Charles Moser has said there is no evidence for the theory that BDSM has common symptoms or any common psychopathology, emphasizing that there is no evidence that BDSM practitioners have any special psychiatric other problems based on their sexual preferences.

Problems sometimes occur with self-classification. During the phase of the &quot;coming-out&quot;, self-questioning related to one&#x27;s own &quot;normality&quot; is common. According to Moser, the discovery of BDSM preferences &quot;can&quot; result in fear of the current non-BDSM relationship&#x27;s destruction. This, combined with the fear of discrimination in everyday life, leads in some cases to a double life which can be highly burdensome. At the same time, the denial of BDSM preferences can induce stress and dissatisfaction with one&#x27;s own &quot;vanilla&quot;-lifestyle, feeding the apprehension of finding no partner. Moser states that BDSM practitioners having problems finding BDSM partners would probably have problems in finding a non-BDSM partner as well. The wish to remove BDSM preferences is another possible reason for psychological problems since it is not possible in most cases. Finally, the scientist states that BDSM practitioners seldom commit violent crimes. From his point of view, crimes of BDSM practitioners usually have no connection with the BDSM components existing in their life. Moser&#x27;s study comes to the conclusion that there is no scientific evidence, which could give reason to refuse members of this group work- or safety certificates, adoption possibilities, custody or other social rights or privileges. The Swiss psychoanalyst Fritz Morgenthaler shares a similar perspective in his book, &quot;Homosexuality, Heterosexuality, Perversion&quot; (1988). He states that possible problems result not necessarily from the non-normative behavior, but in most cases primarily from the real or feared reactions of the social environment towards their own preferences. In 1940 psychoanalyst Theodor Reik reached implicitly the same conclusion in his standard work &quot;Aus Leiden Freuden. Masochismus und Gesellschaft&quot;.

Moser&#x27;s results are further supported by a 2008 Australian study by Richters &quot;et al.&quot; on the demographic and psychosocial features of BDSM participants. The study found that BDSM practitioners were no more likely to have experienced sexual assault than the control group, and were not more likely to feel unhappy or anxious. The BDSM males reported higher levels of psychological well-being than the controls. It was concluded that &quot;BDSM is simply a sexual interest or subculture attractive to a minority, not a pathological symptom of past abuse or difficulty with &#x27;normal&#x27; sex.&quot;

=== Gender differences in research ===

Several recent studies have been conducted on the gender differences and personality traits of BDSM practitioners. Wismeijer and van Assen (2013) found that &quot;the association of BDSM role and gender was strong and significant&quot; with only 8% of women in the study being dominant compared to 75% being submissive.; Hébert and Weaver (2014) found that 9% of women in their study were dominant compared to 88% submissive; Weierstall1 and Giebel (2017) likewise found a significant difference, with 19% of women in the study as dominant compared to 74% as submissive, and a study from Andrea Duarte Silva (2015) indicated that 61.7% of females who are active in BDSM expressed a preference for a submissive role, 25.7% consider themselves a switch, while 12.6% prefer the dominant role. In contrast, 46.6% of men prefer the submissive role, 24% consider themselves to be switches and 29.5% prefer the dominant role. They concluded that &quot;men more often display an engagement in dominant practices, whereas females take on the submissive part. This result is inline with a recent study about mate preferences that has shown that women have a generally higher preference for a dominant partner than men do (Giebel, Moran, Schawohl, &amp; Weierstall, 2015). Women also prefer dominant men, and even men who are aggressive, for a short-term relationship and for the purpose of sexual intercourse (Giebel, Weierstall, Schauer, &amp; Elbert, 2013)&quot;. Similarly, studies on sexual fantasy differences between men and women show the latter prefer submissive and passive fantasies over dominant and active ones, with rape and force being common.

==== Gender differences in masochistic scripts ====
One common belief of BDSM and kink is that women are more likely to take on masochistic roles than men. Roy Baumeister (2010) had more male masochists in his study than female, and fewer male dominants than female. The lack of statistical significance in these gender differences suggests that no assumptions should be made regarding gender and masochistic roles in BDSM. One explanation why we might think otherwise lies in our social and cultural ideals about femininity; masochism may emphasize certain stereotypically feminine elements through activities like feminization of men and ultra-feminine clothing for women. But such tendencies of the submissive masochistic role should not be interpreted as a connection between it and the stereotypical female role—many masochistic scripts do not include any of these tendencies.

Baumeister found that masochistic males experienced greater: severity of pain, frequency of humiliation (status-loss, degrading, oral), partner infidelity, active participation by other persons, and cross-dressing. Trends also suggested that male masochism included more bondage and oral sex than female (though the data was not significant). Female masochists, on the other hand, experienced greater: frequency in pain, pain as punishment for &#x27;misdeeds&#x27; in the relationship context, display humiliation, genital intercourse, and presence of non-participating audiences. The exclusiveness of dominant males in a heterosexual relationship happens because, historically, men in power preferred multiple partners. Finally, Baumeister observes a contrast between the &#x27;intense sensation&#x27; focus of male masochism to a more &#x27;meaning and emotion&#x27; centred female masochistic script.

Prior argues that although some of these women may appear to be engaging in traditional subordinate or submissive roles, BDSM allows women in both dominant and submissive roles to express and experience personal power through their sexual identities. In a study that she conducted in 2013, she found that the majority of the women she interviewed identified as bottom, submissive, captive, or slave/sex slave. In turn, Prior was able to answer whether or not these women found an incongruity between their sexual identities and feminist identity. Her research found that these women saw little to no incongruity, and in fact felt that their feminist identity supported identities of submissive and slave. For them, these are sexually and emotionally fulfilling roles and identities that, in some cases, feed other aspects of their lives. Prior contends that third wave feminism provides a space for women in BDSM communities to express their sexual identities fully, even when those identities seem counter-intuitive to the ideals of feminism. Furthermore, women who do identify as submissive, sexually or otherwise, find a space within BDSM where they can fully express themselves as integrated, well-balanced, and powerful women.

==== Women in S/M culture ====
Levitt, Moser, and Jamison&#x27;s 1994 study provides a general, if outdated, description of characteristics of women in the sadomasochistic (S/M) subculture. They state that women in S/M tend to have higher education, become more aware of their desires as young adults, are less likely to be married than the general population. The researchers found the majority of females identified as heterosexual and submissive, a substantial minority were versatile—able to switch between dominant and submissive roles—and a smaller minority identified with the dominant role exclusively. Oral sex, bondage and master-slave script were among the most popular activities, while feces/watersports were the least popular.

=== Orientation observances in research ===
BDSM is considered by some of its practitioners to be a sexual orientation. The BDSM and kink scene is more often seen as a diverse pansexual community. Often this is a non-judgmental community where gender, sexuality, orientation, preferences are accepted as is or worked at to become something a person can be happy with. In research, studies have focused on bisexuality and its parallels with BDSM, as well as gay-straight differences between practitioners.

==== Asexuality ====
It has been suggested that some asexual people have found a language for navigating relationships through BDSM.

==== Bisexuality ====
In Steve Lenius&#x27; original 2001 paper, he explored the acceptance of bisexuality in a supposedly pansexual BDSM community. The reasoning behind this is that &#x27;coming-out&#x27; had become primarily the territory of the gay and lesbian, with bisexuals feeling the push to be one or the other (and being right only half the time either way). What he found in 2001, was that people in BDSM were open to discussion about the topic of bisexuality and pansexuality and all controversies they bring to the table, but personal biases and issues stood in the way of actively using such labels. A decade later, Lenius (2011) looks back on his study and considers if anything has changed. He concluded that the standing of bisexuals in the BDSM and kink community was unchanged, and believed that positive shifts in attitude were moderated by society&#x27;s changing views towards different sexualities and orientations. But Lenius (2011) does emphasize that the pansexual promoting BDSM community helped advance greater acceptance of alternative sexualities.

Brandy Lin Simula (2012), on the other hand, argues that BDSM actively resists gender-conforming and identified three different types of BDSM bisexuality: gender-switching, gender-based styles (taking on a different gendered style depending on the gender of partner when playing), and rejection of gender (resisting the idea that gender matters in their play partners). Simula (2012) explains that practitioners of BDSM routinely challenge our concepts of sexuality by pushing the limits on pre-existing ideas of sexual orientation and gender norms. For some, BDSM and kink provides a platform in creating identities that are fluid, ever-changing.

==== Comparison between gay and straight men in S/M ====
Demographically, Nordling et al.&#x27;s (2006) study found no differences in age, but 43% of gay male respondents compared to 29% of straight males had university-level education. The gay men also had higher incomes than the general population and tended to work in white-collar jobs while straight men tended toward blue-collar ones. Because there were not enough female respondents (22), no conclusions could be drawn from them.

Sexually speaking, the same 2006 study by Nordling et al. found that gay males were aware of their S/M preferences and took part in them at an earlier age, preferring leather, anal sex, rimming, dildos and special equipment or uniform scenes. In contrast, straight men preferred verbal humiliation, mask and blindfolds, gags, rubber/latex outfits, caning, vaginal sex, straitjackets, and cross-dressing among other activities. From the questionnaire, researchers were able to identify four separate sexual themes: hyper-masculinity, giving and receiving pain, physical restriction (i.e. bondage), and psychological humiliation. Gay men preferred activities that tended towards hyper-masculinity while straight men showed greater preference for humiliation, significantly higher master/madame-slave role play at ≈84%. Though there were not enough female respondents to draw a similar conclusion with, the fact that there is a difference in gay and straight men suggests strongly that S/M (and BDSM in general) can not be considered a homogenous phenomenon. As Nordling et al. (2006) puts it, &quot;People who identify as sadomasochists mean different things by these identifications.&quot; (54)

=== History of psychotherapy and current recommendations ===
Psychiatry has an insensitive history in the area of BDSM. There have been many involvements by institutions of political power to marginalize subgroups and sexual minorities. Mental health professionals have a long history of holding negative assumptions and stereotypes about the BDSM community. Beginning with the DSM-II, Sexual Sadism and Sexual Masochism were listed as sexually deviant behaviours. Sadism and masochism were also found in the personality disorder section. This negative assumption has not changed significantly which is evident in the continued inclusion of Sexual Sadism and Sexual Masochism as paraphilias in the DSM-IV-TR. The DSM-V, however, has depathologized the language around paraphilias in a way that signifies &quot;the APA’s intent to not demand treatment for healthy consenting adult sexual expression&quot;. Still, biases and misinformation can result in pathologizing and unintentional harm to clients who identify as sadists and/or masochists and medical professionals who have been trained under older editions of the DSM can be slow to change in their ways of clinical practice.

According to Kolmes et al. (2006), major themes of biased and inadequate care to BDSM clients are:
* Considering BDSM to be unhealthy
* Requiring a client to give up BDSM activities in order to continue in treatment
* Confusing BDSM with abuse
* Having to educate the therapist about BDSM
* Assuming that BDSM interests are indicative of past family/spousal abuse
* Therapists misrepresenting their expertise by stating that they are BDSM-positive when they lack knowledge of BDSM practices

These same researchers suggested that therapists should be open to learning more about BDSM, to show comfort in talking about BDSM issues, and to understand and promote &quot;safe, sane, consensual&quot; BDSM.

There has also been research which suggests BDSM can be a beneficial way for victims of sexual assault to deal with their trauma, most notably by Corie Hammers, but this work is limited in scope and, to date, has not undergone empirical testing as a treatment.

=== Clinical issues ===
Nichols (2006) compiled some common clinical issues: countertransference, non-disclosure, coming out, partner/families, and bleed-through.

Countertransference is a common problem in clinical settings. Despite having no evidence, therapists may find themselves believing that their client&#x27;s pathology is &quot;self-evident&quot;. Therapists may feel intense disgust and aversive reactions. Feelings of countertransference can interfere with therapy. Another common problem is when clients conceal their sexual preferences from their therapists. This can compromise any therapy. To avoid non-disclosure, therapists are encouraged to communicate their openness in indirect ways with literature and artworks in the waiting room. Therapists can also deliberately bring up BDSM topics during the course of therapy. With less informed therapists, sometimes they over-focus on clients&#x27; sexuality which detracts from original issues such as family relationships, depression, etc. A special subgroup that needs counselling is the &quot;newbie&quot;. Individuals just coming out might have internalized shame, fear, and self-hatred about their sexual preferences. Therapists need to provide acceptance, care, and model positive attitude; providing reassurance, psychoeducation, and bibliotherapy for these clients is crucial. The average age when BDSM individuals realize their sexual preference is around 26 years. Many people hide their sexuality until they can no longer contain their desires. However, they may have married or had children by this point.

== History ==
=== Origins ===


Practices of BDSM survive from some of the oldest textual records in the world, associated with rituals to the goddess Inanna (Ishtar in Akkadian). Cuneiform texts dedicated to Inanna which incorporate domination rituals. In particular, she points to ancient writings such as Inanna and Ebih (in which the goddess dominates Ebih), and Hymn to Inanna describing cross-dressing transformations and rituals &quot;imbued with pain and ecstasy, bringing about initiation and journeys of altered states of consciousness; punishment, moaning, ecstasy, lament and song, participants exhausting themselves in weeping and grief.&quot;

During the 9th century BC, ritual flagellations were performed in Artemis Orthia, one of the most important religious areas of ancient Sparta, where the Cult of Orthia, a pre-Olympic religion, was practiced. Here, ritual flagellation called &quot;diamastigosis&quot; took place, in which young adolescent men were whipped in a ceremony overseen by the priestess. These are referred to by a number of ancient authors, including Pausanius (III, 16: 10–11).

One of the oldest graphical proofs of sadomasochistic activities is found in the Etruscan Tomb of the Whipping near Tarquinia, which dates to the 5th century BC. Inside the tomb, there is a fresco which portrays two men who flagellate a woman with a cane and a hand during an erotic situation. Another reference related to flagellation is to be found in the sixth book of the &quot;Satires&quot; of the ancient Roman Poet Juvenal (1st–2nd century A.D.), further reference can be found in Petronius&#x27;s &quot;Satyricon&quot; where a delinquent is whipped for sexual arousal. Anecdotal narratives related to humans who have had themselves voluntary bound, flagellated or whipped as a substitute for sex or as part of foreplay reach back to the 3rd and 4th century BC.

In Pompeii, a whip-mistress figure with wings is depicted on the wall of the Villa of Mysteries, as part of an initiation of a young woman into the Mysteries. The whip-mistress role drove the sacred initiation of ceremonial death and rebirth. The archaic Greek Aphrodite may too once have been armed with an implement, with archaeological evidence of armed Aphrodites known from a number of locations in Cythera, Acrocorinth and Sparta, and which may have been a whip.

The &quot;Kama Sutra&quot; of India describes four different kinds of hitting during lovemaking, the allowed regions of the human body to target and different kinds of joyful &quot;cries of pain&quot; practiced by bottoms. The collection of historic texts related to sensuous experiences explicitly emphasizes that impact play, biting and pinching during sexual activities should only be performed consensually since only some women consider such behavior to be joyful. From this perspective, the Kama Sutra can be considered one of the first written resources dealing with sadomasochistic activities and safety rules. Further texts with sadomasochistic connotation appear worldwide during the following centuries on a regular basis.

There are anecdotal reports of people willingly being bound or whipped, as a prelude to or substitute for sex, during the 14th century. The medieval phenomenon of courtly love in all of its slavish devotion and ambivalence has been suggested by some writers to be a precursor of BDSM. Some sources claim that BDSM as a distinct form of sexual behavior originated at the beginning of the 18th century when Western civilization began medically and legally categorizing sexual behavior (see Etymology).

Flagellation practiced within an erotic setting has been recorded from at least the 1590s evidenced by a John Davies epigram, and references to &quot;flogging schools&quot; in Thomas Shadwell&#x27;s &quot;The Virtuoso&quot; (1676) and Tim Tell-Troth&#x27;s &quot;Knavery of Astrology&quot; (1680). Visual evidence such as mezzotints and print media is also identified revealing scenes of flagellation, such as &quot;The Cully Flaug&#x27;d&quot; from the British Museum collection.

John Cleland&#x27;s novel &quot;Fanny Hill&quot;, published in 1749, incorporates a flagellation scene between the character&#x27;s protagonist Fanny Hill and Mr Barville. A large number of flagellation publications followed, including &quot;Fashionable Lectures: Composed and Delivered with Birch Discipline&quot; (), promoting the names of women offering the service in a lecture room with rods and cat o&#x27; nine tails.

Other sources give a broader definition, citing BDSM-like behavior in earlier times and other cultures, such as the medieval flagellates and the physical ordeal rituals of some Native American societies.

BDSM ideas and imagery have existed on the fringes of Western culture throughout the 20th century. Robert Bienvenu attributes the origins of modern BDSM to three sources, which he names as &quot;European Fetish&quot; (from 1928), &quot;American Fetish&quot; (from 1934), and &quot;Gay Leather&quot; (from 1950). Another source are the sexual games played in brothels, which go back to the 19th century, if not earlier. Charles Guyette was the first American to produce and distribute fetish related material (costumes, footwear, photography, props and accessories) in the U.S. His successor, Irving Klaw, produced commercial sexploitation film and photography with a BDSM theme (most notably with Bettie Page) and issued fetish comics (known then as &quot;chapter serials&quot;) by the now-iconic artists John Willie, Gene Bilbrew, and Eric Stanton.

Stanton&#x27;s model Bettie Page became at the same time one of the first successful models in the area of fetish photography and one of the most famous pin-up girls of American mainstream culture. Italian author and designer Guido Crepax was deeply influenced by him, coining the style and development of European adult comics in the second half of the 20th century. The artists Helmut Newton and Robert Mapplethorpe are the most prominent examples of the increasing use of BDSM-related motives in modern photography and the public discussions still resulting from this.

Alfred Binet first coined the term &quot;erotic fetishism&quot; in his 1887 book, &quot;Du fétichisme dans l&#x27;amour&quot; Richard von Krafft-Ebing saw BDSM interests as the end of a continuum.

=== Leather movement ===
Leather has been a predominantly gay male term to refer to one fetish, but it can stand for many more. Members of the gay male leather community may wear leathers such as motorcycle leathers, or may be attracted to men wearing leather. Leather and BDSM are seen as two parts of one whole. Much of the BDSM culture can be traced back to the gay male leather culture, which formalized itself out of the group of men who were soldiers returning home after World War II (1939–1945). World War II was the setting where countless homosexual men and women tasted the life among homosexual peers. Post-war, homosexual individuals congregated in larger cities such as New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. They formed leather clubs and bike clubs; some were fraternal services. The establishment of Mr. Leather Contest and Mr. Drummer Contest were made around this time. This was the genesis of the gay male leather community. Many of the members were attracted to extreme forms of sexuality, for which peak expression was in the pre-AIDS 1970s. This subculture is epitomized by the &quot;Leatherman&#x27;s Handbook&quot; by Larry Townsend, published in 1972, which describes in detail the practices and culture of gay male sadomasochists in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
In the early 1980s, lesbians also joined the leathermen as a recognizable element of the gay leather community. They also formed leather clubs, but there were some gender differences, such as the absence of leatherwomen&#x27;s bars. In 1981, the publication of &quot;Coming to Power&quot; by lesbian-feminist group Samois led to a greater knowledge and acceptance of BDSM in the lesbian community. By the 1990s, the gay men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s leather communities were no longer underground and played an important role in the kink community.

Today, the leather movement is generally seen as a part of the BDSM-culture instead of as a development deriving from gay subculture, even if a huge part of the BDSM-subculture was gay in the past. In the 1990s, the so-called New Guard leather subculture evolved. This new orientation started to integrate psychological aspects into their play.

The Leather Archives and Museum (LA&amp;M) in Chicago was founded in 1991 by Chuck Renslow and Tony DeBlase as a “community archives, library, and museum of leather, kink, fetish, and BDSM history and culture.” The LA&amp;M has an extensive collection of leather- and BDSM-related artifacts, including one of three original leather pride flags.

The San Francisco South of Market Leather History Alley consists of four works of art along Ringold Alley honoring leather culture; it opened in 2017. One of the works of art is metal bootprints along the curb which honor 28 people (including Steve McEachern, owner of the Catacombs, a gay and lesbian S/M fisting club, and Cynthia Slater, a founder of the Society of Janus, the second oldest BDSM organization in the United States) who were an important part of the leather communities of San Francisco.

=== Internet ===
In the late 1980s, the Internet provided a way of finding people with specialized interests around the world as well as on a local level, and communicating with them anonymously. This brought about an explosion of interest and knowledge of BDSM, particularly on the usenet group alt.sex.bondage. When that group became too cluttered with spam, the focus moved to soc.subculture.bondage-bdsm. With an increased focus on forms of social media, FetLife was formed, which advertises itself as &quot;a social network for the BDSM and fetish community&quot;. It operates similarly to other social media sites, with the ability to make friends with other users, events, and pages of shared interests.

In addition to traditional sex shops, which sell sex paraphernalia, there has also been an explosive growth of online adult toy companies that specialize in leather/latex gear and BDSM toys. Once a very niche market, there are now very few sex toy companies that do not offer some sort of BDSM or fetish gear in their catalog. Kinky elements seem to have worked their way into &quot;vanilla&quot; markets. The former niche expanded to an important pillar of the business with adult accessories. Today practically all suppliers of sex toys do offer items which originally found usage in the BDSM subculture. Padded handcuffs, latex and leather garments, as well as more exotic items like soft whips for fondling and TENS for erotic electro stimulation, can be found in catalogs aiming at classical vanilla target groups, indicating that former boundaries increasingly seem to shift.

During the last years, the Internet also provides a central platform for networking among individuals who are interested in the subject. Besides countless private and commercial choices, there is an increasing number of local networks and support groups emerging. These groups often offer comprehensive background and health-related information for people who have been unwillingly outed as well as contact lists with information on psychologists, physicians and lawyers who are familiar with BDSM-related topics.

== Legal status ==
=== Austria ===
Section 90 of the Austrian criminal code declares bodily injury (Sections 83–84) or the endangerment of physical security (Section 89) to not be subject to penalty in cases in which the victim has consented and the injury or endangerment does not offend moral sensibilities. Case law from the Austrian Supreme Court has consistently shown that bodily injury is only offensive to moral sensibilities, thus it is only punishable when a &quot;serious injury&quot; (damage to health or an employment disability lasting more than 24 days) or the death of the &quot;victim&quot; results. A &quot;light injury&quot; is generally considered &quot;permissible&quot; when the &quot;victim&quot; has consented to it. In cases of threats to bodily well-being, the standard depends on the probability that an injury will occur. If serious injury or even death would be a likely result of a threat being carried out, then even the threat itself is considered punishable.

=== Canada ===
In 2004, a judge in Canada ruled that videos seized by the police featuring BDSM activities were not obscene and did not constitute violence, but a &quot;normal and acceptable&quot; sexual activity between two consenting adults.

In 2011, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in &quot;R. v. J.A.&quot; that a person must have an active mind during the specific sexual activity in order to legally consent. The Court ruled that it is a criminal offence to perform a sexual act on an unconscious person—whether or not that person consented in advance.

=== Germany ===
According to Section 194 of the German criminal code, the charge of insult (slander) can only be prosecuted if the defamed person chooses to press charges. False imprisonment can be charged if the victim—when applying an objective view—can be considered to be impaired in their rights of free movement. According to Section 228, a person inflicting a bodily injury on another person with that person&#x27;s permission violates the law only in cases where the act can be considered to have violated good morals in spite of permission having been given. On 26 May 2004, the Criminal Panel No. 2 of the Bundesgerichtshof (German Federal Court) ruled that sado-masochistically motivated physical injuries are not per se indecent and thus subject to Section 228.

Following cases in which sado-masochistic practices had been repeatedly used as pressure tactics against former partners in custody cases, the Appeals Court of Hamm ruled in February 2006 that sexual inclinations toward sado-masochism are no indication of a lack of capabilities for successful child-raising.

=== Italy ===
In Italian law, BDSM is right on the border between crime and legality, and everything lies in the interpretation of the legal code by the judge. This concept is that anyone willingly causing &quot;injury&quot; to another person is to be punished. In this context, though, &quot;injury&quot; is legally defined as &quot;anything causing a condition of illness&quot;, and &quot;illness&quot; is ill-defined itself in two different legal ways. The first is &quot;any anatomical or functional alteration of the organism&quot; (thus technically including little scratches and bruises too); the second is &quot;a significant worsening of a previous condition relevant to organic and relational processes, requiring any kind of therapy&quot;. This could make it somewhat risky to play with someone, as later the &quot;victim&quot; may call foul play citing even an insignificant mark as evidence against the partner. Also, any injury requiring over 20 days of medical care must be denounced by the professional medic who discovers it, leading to automatic indictment of the person who caused it.

=== Nordic countries ===
In September 2010, a Swedish court acquitted a 32-year-old man of assault for engaging in consensual BDSM play with a 16-year-old girl (the age of consent in Sweden is 15). Norway&#x27;s legal system has likewise taken a similar position, that safe and consensual BDSM play should not be subject to criminal prosecution. This parallels the stance of the mental health professions in the Nordic countries which have removed sadomasochism from their respective lists of psychiatric illnesses.

=== Switzerland ===
The age of consent in Switzerland is 16 years, which also applies to BDSM play. Minors (i.e., those under 16) are not subject to punishment for BDSM play as long as the age difference between them is less than three years. Certain practices, however, require granting consent for light injuries, with only those over 18 permitted to give consent. On 1 April 2002, Articles 135 and 197 of the Swiss Criminal Code were tightened to make ownership of &quot;objects or demonstrations [...] which depict sexual acts with violent content&quot; a punishable offense. This law amounts to a general criminalization of sado-masochism since nearly every sado-masochist will have some kind of media that fulfills this criterion. Critics also object to the wording of the law which puts sado-masochists in the same category as pedophiles and pederasts.

=== United Kingdom ===
In British law, consent is an absolute defense to common assault, but not necessarily to actual bodily harm, where courts may decide that consent is not valid, as occurred in the case of &quot;R v Brown&quot;. Accordingly, consensual activities in the U.K. may not constitute &quot;assault occasioning actual or grievous bodily harm&quot; in law. The Spanner Trust states that this is defined as activities which have caused injury &quot;of a lasting nature&quot; but that only a slight duration or injury might be considered &quot;lasting&quot; in law. The decision contrasts with the later case of &quot;R v Wilson&quot; in which conviction for non-sexual consensual branding within a marriage was overturned, the appeal court ruling that &quot;R v Brown&quot; was not an authority in all cases of consensual injury and criticizing the decision to prosecute.

Following Operation Spanner, the European Court of Human Rights ruled in January 1999 in &quot;Laskey, Jaggard and Brown v. United Kingdom&quot; that no violation of Article 8 occurred because the amount of physical or psychological harm that the law allows between any two people, even consenting adults, is to be determined by the jurisdiction the individuals live in, as it is the State&#x27;s responsibility to balance the concerns of public health and well-being with the amount of control a State should be allowed to exercise over its citizens. In the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill 2007, the British Government cited the Spanner case as justification for criminalizing images of consensual acts, as part of its proposed criminalization of possession of &quot;extreme pornography&quot;. Another contrasting case was that of Stephen Lock in 2013, who was cleared of actual bodily harm on the grounds that the woman consented. In this case, the act was deemed to be sexual.

=== United States ===

The United States Federal law does not list a specific criminal determination for consensual BDSM acts. Many BDSM practitioners cite the legal decision of &quot;People v. Jovanovic&quot;, 95 N.Y.2d 846 (2000), or the &quot;Cybersex Torture Case&quot;, which was the first U.S. appellate decision to hold (in effect) that one does not commit assault if the victim consents. However, many individual states do criminalize specific BDSM actions within their state borders. Some states specifically address the idea of &quot;consent to BDSM acts&quot; within their assault laws, such as the state of New Jersey, which defines &quot;simple assault&quot; to be &quot;a disorderly persons offense unless committed in a fight or scuffle &quot;entered into by mutual consent&quot;, in which case it is a petty disorderly persons offense&quot;.

Oregon Ballot Measure 9 was a ballot measure in the U.S. state of Oregon in 1992, concerning sadism, masochism, gay rights, pedophilia, and public education, that drew widespread national attention. It would have added the following text to the Oregon Constitution:

It was defeated in the 3 November 1992 general election with 638,527 votes in favor, 828,290 votes against.

The National Coalition for Sexual Freedom collects reports about punishment for sexual activities engaged in by consenting adults, and about its use in child custody cases.

== Cultural aspects ==

Today, the BDSM culture exists in most Western countries. This offers BDSM practitioners the opportunity to discuss BDSM relevant topics and problems with like-minded people. This culture is often viewed as a subculture, mainly because BDSM is often still regarded as &quot;unusual&quot; by some of the public. Many people hide their leaning from society since they are afraid of the incomprehension and of social exclusion.

In contrast to frameworks seeking to explain sadomasochism through psychological, psychoanalytic, medical or forensic approaches, which seek to categorize behaviour and desires and find a root &quot;cause&quot;, Romana Byrne suggests that such practices can be seen as examples of &quot;aesthetic sexuality&quot;, in which a founding physiological or psychological impulse is irrelevant. Rather, sadism and masochism may be practiced through choice and deliberation, driven by certain aesthetic goals tied to style, pleasure, and identity. These practices, in certain circumstances and contexts, can be compared with the creation of art.

=== Symbols ===
One of the most commonly used symbols of the BDSM community is a derivation of a triskelion shape within a circle. Various forms of triskele have had many uses and many meanings in many cultures; its BDSM usage derives from the &quot;Ring of O&quot; in the classic book &quot;Story of O&quot;. The BDSM Emblem Project claims copyright over one particular specified form of the triskelion symbol; other variants of the triskelion are free from such copyright claims.

The triskelion as a BDSM symbol can easily be perceived as the three separate parts of the acronym BDSM; which are BD, DS, and SM (Bondage &amp; Discipline, Dominance &amp; Submission, Sadism &amp; Masochism). They are three separate items, that are normally associated together.
The leather pride flag, shown to the right, is a symbol for the leather subculture and also widely used within BDSM. In continental Europe, the &quot;Ring of O&quot; is widespread among BDSM practitioners.
The BDSM rights flag, shown to the right, was designed by Tanos, a Master from the United Kingdom. It is partially loosely based on the design of the leather pride flag, and also includes a version of the BDSM Emblem (but not similar enough to fall within Steve Quagmyr&#x27;s specific copyright claims for the Emblem). The BDSM rights flag is intended to represent the belief that people whose sexuality or relationship preferences include BDSM practices deserve the same human rights as everyone else, and should not be discriminated against for pursuing BDSM with consenting adults.

The flag is inspired by the leather pride flag and BDSM emblem but is specifically intended to represent the concept of BDSM rights and to be without the other symbols&#x27; restrictions against commercial use. It is designed to be recognizable by people familiar with either the leather pride flag or BDSM triskelion (or triskele) as &quot;something to do with BDSM&quot;; and to be distinctive whether reproduced in full colour, or in black and white (or another pair of colours).

BDSM and fetish items and styles have been spread widely in Western societies&#x27; everyday life by different factors, such as avant-garde fashion, heavy metal, goth subculture, and science fiction TV series, and are often not consciously connected with their BDSM roots by many people. While it was mainly confined to the punk and BDSM subcultures in the 1990s, it has since spread into wider parts of Western societies.

=== Film and music ===
* In music: The Romanian singer-songwriter :ro:NAVI featured BDSM and Shibari scenes in her music video &quot;Picture Perfect&quot; (2014). The video was banned in Romania for its explicit content. In 2010, Rihanna&#x27;s song &quot;S&amp;M&quot; and Christina Aguilera&#x27;s single &quot;Not Myself Tonight&quot; appeared, both full of BDSM imagery.
* In movies: While BDSM activity appeared initially in subtle form, in the 1960s famous works of literature like &quot;Story of O&quot; and &quot;Venus in Furs&quot; were filmed explicitly. With the release of the 1986 film &quot;9½ Weeks&quot;, the topic of BDSM was transferred to mainstream cinema. From the 1990s, cinematic representation of alternative sexualities, including BDSM, increased dramatically, as seen in documentary productions such as &quot;Graphic Sexual Horror&quot; (a 2009 film based on the website Insex), &quot;Kink&quot; (a 2013 film based on the website Kink.com), and movies such as &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot; (2015) and its two sequels &quot;Fifty Shades Darker&quot; (2017) and &quot;Fifty Shades Freed&quot; (2018).
** However, mistakenly considered in mainstream society as having BDSM activities that are, rather, abusive are the movies &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot; (2015) and its two sequels &quot;Fifty Shades Darker&quot; (2017) and &quot;Fifty Shades Freed&quot; (2018). &quot;A lot of what happens in the main relationship of Fifty Shades of Grey is domestic abuse, both physical and emotional, and for people whose entire understanding of BDSM now comes from jiggle balls and rooms of pain this is a dangerous misconception to foster.&quot;

=== Theater ===
Although it would be possible to establish certain elements related to BDSM in classical theater, not until the emergence of contemporary theater would some plays have BDSM as the main theme. Exemplifying this are two works: one Austrian, one German, in which BDSM is not only incorporated but integral to the storyline of the play.
* &quot;Worauf sich Körper kaprizieren&quot;, Austria. Peter Kern directed and wrote the script for this comedy which is a present-day adaption of Jean Genet&#x27;s 1950 film, . It is about a marriage in which the wife (film veteran Miriam Goldschmidt) submits her husband (Heinrich Herkie) and the butler (Günter Bubbnik) to her sadistic treatment until two new characters take their places.
* &quot;Ach, Hilde&quot; (&quot;Oh, Hilda&quot;), Germany. This play by Anna Schwemmer premiered in Berlin. A young Hilde becomes pregnant, and after being abandoned by her boyfriend she decides to become a professional dominatrix to earn money. The play carefully crafts a playful and frivolous picture of the field of professional dominatrices.

=== Literature ===

Although examples of literature catering to BDSM and fetishistic tastes were created in earlier periods, BDSM literature as it exists today cannot be found much earlier than World War II.

The word &quot;sadism&quot; originates from the works of Donatien Alphonse François, Marquis de Sade, and the word &quot;masochism&quot; originates from Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, the author of &quot;Venus in Furs&quot;. However, it is worth noting that the Marquis de Sade describes non-consensual abuse in his works, such as in &quot;Justine&quot;. &quot;Venus in Furs&quot; describes a consensual dom-sub relationship.

A central work in modern BDSM literature is undoubtedly &quot;Story of O&quot; (1954) by Anne Desclos under the pseudonym Pauline Réage.

Other notable works include &quot;9½ Weeks&quot; (1978) by Elizabeth McNeill, some works of the writer Anne Rice (&quot;Exit to Eden&quot;, and her &quot;Claiming of Sleeping Beauty&quot; series of books), Jeanne de Berg (&quot;L&#x27;Image&quot; (1956) dedicated to Pauline Réage), the Gor series by John Norman, and naturally all the works of Patrick Califia, Gloria Brame, the group Samois and many of the writer Georges Bataille (&quot;Histoire de l&#x27;oeil-Story of the Eye&quot;, Madame Edwarda, 1937), as well as those of Bob Flanagan (&quot;Slave Sonnets&quot; (1986), &quot;Fuck Journal&quot; (1987), &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot; (1990)). A common part of many of the poems of Pablo Neruda is a reflection on feelings and sensations arising from the relations of EPE or erotic exchange of power. The &quot;Fifty Shades&quot; trilogy is a series of very popular erotic romance novels by E. L. James which involves BDSM; however, the novels have been criticized for their inaccurate and harmful depiction of BDSM.

In the 21st century, a number of prestigious university presses, such as Duke University, Indiana University and University of Chicago, have published books on BDSM written by professors, thereby lending academic legitimacy to this once taboo topic.

=== Art ===

* In photography: Eric Kroll and Irving Klaw (with Bettie Page, the first well-known bondage model), and Japanese photographer Araki Nobuyoshi, whose works are exhibited in several major art museums, galleries and private collections, such as the Baroness Marion Lambert, the world&#x27;s largest holder of contemporary photographic art. Also Robert Mapplethorpe, whose most controversial work is that of the underground BDSM scene in the late 1960s and early 1970s of New York. The homoeroticism of this work fuelled a national debate over the public funding of controversial artwork.
* Comic book drawings: Guido Crepax with &quot;Histoire d&#x27;O&quot; (1975), &quot;Justine&quot; (1979) and &quot;Venere in Pelliccia&quot; (1984); inspired by the work of Pauline Réage, the Marquis de Sade and Leopold von Sacher-Masoch. John Willie and &quot;The Adventures of Sweet Gwendoline&quot; (1984) which was the basis for the film &quot;The Perils of Gwendoline in the Land of the Yik-Yak&quot;. The &quot;Sunstone/Mercy&quot; (2011-ongoing) books by Stjepan Sejic have become very popular and are found in many conventional bookstores around the world.
* In graphic design: Eric Stanton and his work on dominance and female bondage, as well as Hajime Sorayama and Robert Bishop.
* In art deco sculpture: Bruno Zach produced perhaps his best known sculpture—called &quot;The Riding Crop&quot; ()—which features a scantily clad dominatrix wielding a riding crop.

<text>In computing, Bash (short for &quot;&quot;Bourne Again SHell&quot;,&quot;) is an interactive command interpreter and command programming language developed for UNIX-like operating systems. Created in 1989 by Brian Fox for the GNU Project, it is supported by the Free Software Foundation and designed as a 100% free alternative for the Bourne shell (codice_1) and other proprietary Unix shells.

Since its inception, Bash has gained widespread adoption and is commonly used as the default login shell for numerous Linux distributions. It holds historical significance as one of the earliest programs ported to Linux by Linus Torvalds, alongside the GNU Compiler (GCC). It is available on nearly all modern operating systems, making it a versatile tool in various computing environments.

As a command-line interface (CLI), Bash operates within a terminal emulator, or text window, where users input commands to execute various tasks. It also supports the execution of commands from files, known as shell scripts, facilitating automation. In keeping with Unix shell conventions, Bash incorporates a rich set of features. The keywords, syntax, dynamically scoped variables, and other basic features of the language are all copied from the Bourne shell, (codice_1). Other features, e.g., history, are copied from the C shell, (codice_3), and the Korn Shell, (codice_4). It is a POSIX-compliant shell with extensions.

== History ==
While Bash was developed for UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems, such as GNU/Linux, it is also available on Android, macOS, Windows, and numerous other current and historical operating systems. &quot;Although there have been attempts to create specialized shells, the Bourne shell derivatives continue to be the primary shells in use.&quot;

== Features ==

=== List of Short Descriptions ===
As a command processor, Bash operates within a text window where users input commands to execute various tasks. It also supports the execution of commands from files, known as shell scripts, facilitating automation. In keeping with Unix shell conventions, Bash incorporates a rich set of features, including:

* A User Manual provided by the GNU Project, also available at codice_5, and a technical manual available at codice_6.
* Invocation as a...
** Interactive shell,
** Non-interactive shell, or
** Login shell;
* A command-line interface;
* Exit status codes;
* Control structures for 
** Condition testing,
*** codice_7, codice_8, codice_9,
*** logical AND (codice_10) and OR (codice_11), and
** Iteration:
*** codice_12, codice_13, codice_14 loops, and
*** Arithmetic C-style loop: codice_15;
* Syntaxes for Boolean testing of file attributes, string and integer values, etc.: 
** Traditional codice_16 command,
** Traditional single bracket test: codice_17, 
** Modern double bracket test: codice_18, which includes advanced features:
*** Extended regular expression and extglob matching
*** Lexicographic sorting with codice_19 and codice_20;
* UNIX-style pipelines: codice_21;
* Subshells: codice_22;
* Signaling as a means of inter-process communication using the codice_23 builtin;
* Asynchronous execution, i.e., Jobs and job control: 
** codice_24 where codice_25 can be one of:
*** A full commandline: codice_26, or
*** A job control identifier as denoted by a leading percent symbol: codice_27;
* A shell portability mode where command lines can be interpreted in conformance with the POSIX standard;
* Command parsing:
** Comments are ignored:
*** Bourne-style codice_28 hashtag comments, and
*** Thompson-style codice_29 colon comments;
** Commands are parsed one line at a time:
*** Control structures are honored, and
*** Backslash codice_30 escapes are also honored at the ends of lines;
** Split into words (i.e., word splitting) according to quoting rules, 
*** Including ANSI-C quoting codice_31;
** Seven kinds of expansions are performed in the following order on the resulting string:
*** (Step 1) Brace expansion codice_32,
*** (Step 2) Tilde expansion codice_33,
*** (Step 3) In a left-to-right fashion: 
**** Parameter and variable expansion codice_34 or codice_35, including
***** Dynamically scoped variables, 
***** Indexed arrays of unlimited size, 
***** Associative arrays via codice_36, and 
***** Expansion syntaxes which can perform some tasks more quickly than external utilities, including, among others:
****** Pattern Substitution
******* codice_37 for codice_38,
****** Remove Matching Prefix or Suffix Pattern
******* codice_39 for codice_40,
****** Print Array Keys
******* codice_41, and
****** Display Error if Null or Unset
******* codice_42,
**** Command substitution: codice_43,
**** Process substitution, codice_44 or codice_45, when a system supports it:
**** Arithmetic expansion, codice_46 or codice_47, including
***** Integer arithmetic in any base from two to sixty-four, although
***** Floating-point arithmetic is not available from within the shell itself (for this functionality, see current versions of codice_48 and codice_49, among others),
*** (Step 4) Word splitting (again), 
*** (Step 5) Pathname expansion, i.e., shell-style globbing and pattern matching using codice_50, codice_51, codice_52, and
**** (Although they can be used in conjunction, the use of brackets in pattern matching, codice_52, and the use of brackets in the testing commands, codice_17 and codice_18, are each one different things.)
*** Quote removal;
** Redirections of Standard Input, Standard Output and Standard Error data streams are performed, including
*** File writing, codice_20, and appending, codice_57,
*** Here documents, codice_58,
*** Here strings, codice_59, which allow parameters to be used as input, and
*** A redirection operator, codice_60, which can force overwriting of a file when a shell&#x27;s &quot;noclobber&quot; setting is enabled; 
** Command name lookup is performed, in the following order:
*** Commands internal to the shell: 
**** Shell aliases, 
**** Shell reserved words,
**** Shell functions, and
**** Shell built-in commands;
*** Commands external to the shell: 
**** Separate UNIX-style programs such as codice_61 or codice_62, and
**** Shell scripts, which are files containing executable commands. (Shell scripts do not require compilation before execution and, when certain requirements are met, can be invoked as commands by using their filename.)
** The resulting string is executed as a command.

Bash also offers...

* Configurable execution environment(s):
** Shell and session startup files such as codice_63 and codice_64 (i.e., dotfiles);
** Settings (codice_65 built-in) and shell options (codice_66 built-in) which alter shell behavior;
* Support for Unicode;
* With interactive invocation only,
** Unlimited size command history, 
** A directory stack (see codice_67 and codice_68 built-ins),
** Tab completion,
** Configurable prompts, and
** Command line editing with GNU readline;
* Lightweight logging for debugging purposes (xtrace), and other lightweight debugging options (errexit, noexec, nounset, pipefail, etc.);
* Shell compatibility modes: bash 5.1 can operate as if it were bash 4.2, etc.;
* Various Built-In Commands:
** codice_69
** codice_70
* Documentation:
** A built-in codice_71 command.
** A man page, and 
** An info page which is the same as the GNU manual;
* Informal avenues of support via:
** IRC at libera.chat #bash

The Bash command syntax is a superset of the Bourne shell command syntax. Bash supports brace expansion, command line completion (Programmable Completion), basic debugging and signal handling (using codice_23) since bash 2.05a among other features. Bash can execute the vast majority of Bourne shell scripts without modification, with the exception of Bourne shell scripts stumbling into fringe syntax behavior interpreted differently in Bash or attempting to run a system command matching a newer Bash builtin, etc. Bash command syntax includes ideas drawn from the Korn Shell (ksh) and the C shell (csh) such as command line editing, command history (codice_73 command), the directory stack, the codice_74 and codice_75 variables, and POSIX command substitution syntax codice_76.

When a user presses the tab key within an interactive command-shell, Bash automatically uses command line completion, since beta version 2.04, to match partly typed program names, filenames and variable names. The Bash command-line completion system is very flexible and customizable, and is often packaged with functions that complete arguments and filenames for specific programs and tasks.

Bash&#x27;s syntax has many extensions lacking in the Bourne shell. Bash can perform integer calculations (&quot;arithmetic evaluation&quot;) without spawning external processes. It uses the codice_77 command and the codice_78 variable syntax for this purpose. Its syntax simplifies I/O redirection. For example, it can redirect standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) at the same time using the codice_79 operator. This is simpler to type than the Bourne shell equivalent &#x27;codice_80&#x27;. Bash supports process substitution using the codice_81 and codice_82syntax, which substitutes the output of (or input to) a command where a filename is normally used. (This is implemented through &quot;/proc/fd/&quot; unnamed pipes on systems that support that, or via temporary named pipes where necessary).

When using the &#x27;function&#x27; keyword, Bash function declarations are not compatible with Bourne/Korn/POSIX scripts (the KornShell has the same problem when using &#x27;function&#x27;), but Bash accepts the same function declaration syntax as the Bourne and Korn shells, and is POSIX-conformant. Because of these and other differences, Bash shell scripts are rarely runnable under the Bourne or Korn shell interpreters unless deliberately written with that compatibility in mind, which is becoming less common as Linux becomes more widespread. But in POSIX mode, Bash conforms with POSIX more closely.

Bash supports here documents. Since version 2.05b Bash can redirect standard input (stdin) from a &quot;here string&quot; using the codice_59 operator.

Bash 3.0 supports in-process regular expression matching using a syntax reminiscent of Perl.

In February 2009, Bash 4.0 introduced support for associative arrays. Associative array indices are strings, in a manner similar to AWK or Tcl. They can be used to emulate multidimensional arrays. Bash 4 also switches its license to GPL-3.0-or-later.
=== Control Structures ===

Bash supplies &quot;conditional execution&quot; command separators that make execution of a command contingent on the exit code set by a precedent command. For example:
cd &quot;$SOMEWHERE&quot; &amp;&amp; ./do_something || echo &quot;An error occurred&quot; &gt;&amp;2
Where is only executed if the (change directory) command was &quot;successful&quot; (returned an exit status of zero) and the command would only be executed if either the or the command return an &quot;error&quot; (non-zero exit status).

For all commands the exit status is stored in the special variable codice_84. Bash also supports and forms of conditional command evaluation.
=== Process Management (a.k.a., &quot;Job control&quot;) ===
The Bash shell has two modes of execution for commands: batch (asynchronous), and concurrent (synchronous).

To execute commands in batch mode (i.e., in sequence) they must be separated by the character &quot;;&quot;, or on separate lines:
command1; command2
command3
In this example, when command1 is finished, command2 is executed, and when command2 has completed, command3 will execute.

A background execution of command1 can occur using (symbol &amp;) at the end of an execution command, and process will be executed in background while immediately returning control to the shell and allowing continued execution of commands.
command1 &amp;

Or to have a concurrent execution of command1 and command2, they must be executed in the Bash shell in the following way:
command1 &amp; command2
In this case command1 is executed in the background &quot;&amp;&quot; symbol, returning immediately control to the shell that executes command2 in the foreground.

A process can be stopped and control returned to bash by typing while the process is running in the foreground.

A list of all processes, both in the background and stopped, can be achieved by running codice_85:

$ jobs
[1]- Running command1 &amp;
[2]+ Stopped command2
In the output, the number in brackets refers to the job id. The plus sign signifies the default process for codice_86 and codice_87. The text &quot;Running&quot; and &quot;Stopped&quot; refer to the process state. The last string is the command that started the process.

The state of a process can be changed using various commands. The codice_87 command brings a process to the foreground, while codice_86 sets a stopped process running in the background. codice_86 and codice_87 can take a job id as their first argument, to specify the process to act on. Without one, they use the default process, identified by a plus sign in the output of codice_85. The codice_93 command can be used to end a process prematurely, by sending it a signal. The job id must be specified after a percent sign:
kill %1
=== Portability with POSIX ===
Invoking Bash with the codice_94 option or stating codice_95 in a script causes Bash to conform very closely with the POSIX 1003.2 standard. Bash shell scripts intended for portability should take into account at least the POSIX shell standard. Some bash features not found in POSIX are:
* Certain extended invocation options
* Brace expansion
* Arrays and associative arrays
* The double bracket extended test construct and its regex matching
* The double-parentheses arithmetic-evaluation construct (only ; is POSIX)
* Certain string-manipulation operations in parameter expansion
* for scoped variables
* Process substitution
* Bash-specific builtins
* Coprocesses
* $EPOCHSECONDS and $EPOCHREALTIME variables
If a piece of code uses such a feature, it is called a &quot;bashism&quot; – a problem for portable use. Debian&#x27;s and Vidar Holen&#x27;s can be used to make sure that a script does not contain these parts. The list varies depending on the actual target shell: Debian&#x27;s policy allows some extensions in their scripts (as they are in the dash shell), while a script intending to support pre-POSIX Bourne shells, like autoconf&#x27;s , are even more limited in the features they can use.
=== Brace Expansion ===
Brace expansion, also called alternation, is a feature copied from the C shell. It generates a set of alternative combinations. Generated results need not exist as files. The results of each expanded string are not sorted and left to right order is preserved:
$ echo a{p,c,d,b}e
ape ace ade abe
$ echo {a,b,c}{d,e,f}
ad ae af bd be bf cd ce cf

Users should not use brace expansions in portable shell scripts, because the Bourne shell does not produce the same output.
$ # bash shell
$/bin/bash -c &#x27;echo a{p,c,d,b}e&#x27;
ape ace ade abe
$ # A traditional shell does not produce the same output
$ /bin/sh -c &#x27;echo a{p,c,d,b}e&#x27;
a{p,c,d,b}e
When brace expansion is combined with wildcards, the braces are expanded first, and then the resulting wildcards are substituted normally. Hence, a listing of JPEG and PNG images in the current directory could be obtained using:
ls *.{jpg,jpeg,png} # expands to *.jpg *.jpeg *.png - after which,
 # the wildcards are processed
echo *.{png,jp{e,}g} # echo just shows the expansions -
 # and braces in braces are possible.
In addition to alternation, brace expansion can be used for sequential ranges between two integers or characters separated by double dots. Newer versions of Bash allow a third integer to specify the increment.
$ echo {1..10}
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
$ echo {01..10}
01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10
$ echo file{1..4}.txt
file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt file4.txt
$ echo {a..e}
a b c d e
$ echo {1..10..3}
1 4 7 10
$ echo {a..j..3}
a d g j
When brace expansion is combined with variable expansion (A.K.A. &quot;parameter expansion&quot; and &quot;parameter substitution&quot;) the variable expansion is performed &quot;after&quot; the brace expansion, which in some cases may necessitate the use of the codice_96 built-in, thus:
$ start=1; end=10
$ echo {$start..$end} # fails to expand due to the evaluation order
{1..10}
$ eval echo {$start..$end} # variable expansion occurs then resulting string is evaluated
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

=== Configurable execution environment(s) ===
==== Shell and Session Startup Files (a.k.a., &quot;Dot Files&quot;) ====

When Bash starts, it executes the commands in a variety of dot files. Unlike Bash shell scripts, dot files do typically have neither the execute permission enabled nor an interpreter directive like codice_97.

===== Legacy-compatible Bash startup example =====
The example codice_98 below is compatible with the Bourne shell and gives semantics similar to csh for the codice_63 and codice_100. The codice_101 is a short-circuit evaluation that tests if &quot;filename&quot; exists and is readable, skipping the part after the codice_10 if it is not.
[ -r ~/.profile ] &amp;&amp; . ~/.profile # set up environment, once, Bourne-sh syntax only
if [ -n &quot;$PS1&quot; ] ; then # are we interactive?
 [ -r ~/.bashrc ] &amp;&amp; . ~/.bashrc # tty/prompt/function setup for interactive shells
 [ -r ~/.bash_login ] &amp;&amp; . ~/.bash_login # any at-login tasks for login shell only
fi # End of &quot;if&quot; block
===== Operating system issues in Bash startup =====
Some versions of Unix and Linux contain Bash system startup scripts, generally under the codice_103 directory. Bash executes these files as part of its standard initialization, but other startup files can read them in a different order than the documented Bash startup sequence. The default content of the root user&#x27;s files may also have issues, as well as the skeleton files the system provides to new user accounts upon setup. The startup scripts that launch the X window system may also do surprising things with the user&#x27;s Bash startup scripts in an attempt to set up user-environment variables before launching the window manager. These issues can often be addressed using a codice_104 or codice_105 file to read the codice_64 — which provides the environment variables that Bash shell windows spawned from the window manager need, such as xterm or Gnome Terminal.

==== Settings and Shell Options ====
===== The codice_65 Built-in =====
* Xtrace: [ codice_108 | codice_109 ]
The shell&#x27;s primary means of debugging. Both xtrace and verbose can be turned off at the same time with the command codice_110.
* Verbose: [ codice_111 | codice_112 ]
Prints a command to the terminal as Bash reads it. Bash reads constructs all at once, such as compound commands which include if-fi and case-esac blocks. If a codice_111 is included within a compound command, then &quot;verbose&quot; will be enabled the next time Bash reads code as input, ie, after the end of the currently executing construct. Both xtrace and verbose can be turned off at the same time with the command codice_110.
===== The codice_66 Built-in ===== 
* expand-aliases
On by default in interactive shells. Some developers discourage its use in scripts. 
=== Programmable Completion ===
Bash supports programmable completion via built-in codice_116, , and codice_117 commands. The feature has been available since the beta version of 2.04 released in 2000. These commands enable complex and intelligent completion specification for commands (i.e. installed programs), functions, variables, and filenames.

The codice_116 and two commands specify how arguments of some available commands or options are going to be listed in the readline input. As of version 5.1 completion of the command or the option is usually activated by the keystroke after typing its name.
=== Keyboard shortcuts with Readline ===

Bash uses GNU Readline to provide keyboard shortcuts for command line editing using the default ( Emacs ) key bindings. Vi-bindings can be enabled by running codice_119.
== Documentation ==
As the standard upon which bash is based, the POSIX Standard, or IEEE Std 1003.1, et seq, is especially informative.

The Linux &quot;man page&quot; is intended to be the authoritative explanatory technical document for the understanding of how codice_120 operates. It is usually available by running codice_6.

The GNU manual is sometimes considered more user-friendly for reading. &quot;You may also find information about Bash by running codice_5 ... or by looking at codice_123, codice_124, or similar directories on your system. A brief summary is available by running codice_125.

&quot; If a user invoke RUNCOM without any arguments it prints some instructions on how to use it and stops, returning the user to the supervisor&#x27;s (system&#x27;s) command line.(RUNCOM)&quot;

On modern Linuxes, information on shell built-in commands can be found by executing codice_71, codice_127 or codice_128 at a terminal prompt where bash is installed. Some commands, such as codice_129, codice_130, codice_131, codice_132, codice_16 or codice_134, depending on your system and on your locally installed version of bash, can refer to either a shell built-in or a system binary executable file. When one of these command name collisions occurs, bash will by default execute a given command line using the shell built-in. Specifying a binary executable&#x27;s absolute path (i.e., codice_135) is one way of ensuring that the shell uses a system binary. This name collision issue also effects any &quot;help summaries&quot; viewed with codice_136 and codice_137. Shell built-ins and system binary executable files of the same name often have differing options.

&quot;The project maintainer also has a Bash page which includes Frequently Asked Questions&quot;, this FAQ is current as of bash version 5.1 and is no longer updated.

== Security and Vulnerabilities ==

=== Root Scripts ===
Running any shell scripts as the root user has, for years, been widely criticized as poor security practice. One commonly given reason is that, when a script is executed as root, the negative effects of any bugs in a script would be magnified by root&#x27;s elevated privileges.

One common example: a script contains the command, codice_138, but the variable codice_139 is left undefined. In Linux, if the script was executed by a regular user, the shell would attempt to execute the command codice_140 as a regular user, and the command would fail. However, if the script was executed by the root user, then the command would likely succeed and the filesystem would be erased.

It is recommended to use codice_141 on a per-command basis instead.

==== Examples ====
With the parameter expansion, an unset or null variable can halt a script.
* ex.sh
#!/bin/bash

echo &quot;${foo:?$bar}&quot;
echo this message doesn&#x27;t print
$ ./ex.sh
./ex.sh: line 3: foo: foo is not defined
Reliably printing the contents of an array that contains spaces and newlines first in a portable syntax, and then the same thing in Bash. Note that in Bash, the number of spaces before the newline is made clear.
$ # In POSIX shell:
$ array=( &quot;a &quot; &quot; b&quot; &quot;
&gt; c &quot; )
$ printf &#x27;,%s,\n&#x27; &quot;${array[@]}&quot;
,a ,
, b,
 c ,
# In Bash:
declare -p array
declare -a array=([0]=&quot;a &quot; [1]=&quot; b&quot; [2]=$&#x27; \n c &#x27;)
Printing an error message when there&#x27;s a problem.
* error.sh
if ! lsblk | grep sdb
then
 echo Error, line $LINENO
fi
$ ./error.sh
Error, line 130
Using xtrace. If errexit had been enabled, then would not have been executed.

* test.sh
#!/bin/bash
set -x
foo=bar; echo $foo
false
echo quux
$ ./test.sh
+ foo=bar
+ echo bar
bar
+ false
+ echo quux
quux
=== Deprecated syntax ===

* Back-tick style command substitutions: codice_142 is deprecated in favor of codice_76;

* Use of -a or -o in codice_16/codice_17/codice_146 commands,
** for example, codice_147 is deprecated in favor of codice_148;

* Use of the arithmetic syntax codice_149 is deprecated in favor of codice_78 or codice_77, as appropriate;

* Use of codice_152 as a pipeline is deprecated in favor of codice_21;

* Any uses of codice_154 or codice_155.

=== Shellshock ===
In September 2014, a security bug was discovered in the program. It was dubbed &quot;Shellshock.&quot; Public disclosure quickly led to a range of attacks across the Internet.

Exploitation of the vulnerability could enable arbitrary code execution in CGI scripts executable by certain versions of Bash. The bug involved how Bash passed function definitions to subshells through environment variables. The bug had been present in the source code since August 1989 (version 1.03) and was patched in September 2014 (version 4.3).

Patches to fix the bugs were made available soon after the bugs were identified. Upgrading to a current version is strongly advised.

It was assigned the Common Vulnerability identifiers , among others. Under CVSS Metrics 2.x and 3.x, the bug is regarded as &quot;high&quot; and &quot;critical,&quot; respectively.

=== Bug reporting ===

An external command called &quot;bashbug&quot; reports Bash shell bugs. When the command is invoked, it brings up the user&#x27;s default editor with a form to fill in. The form is mailed to the Bash maintainers (or optionally to other email addresses).

<text>A blizzard is a severe snowstorm characterized by strong sustained winds and low visibility, lasting for a prolonged period of time—typically at least three or four hours. A ground blizzard is a weather condition where snow that has already fallen is being blown by wind. Blizzards can have an immense size and usually stretch to hundreds or thousands of kilometres.


==Definition and etymology==
In the United States, the National Weather Service defines a blizzard as a severe snow storm characterized by strong winds causing blowing snow that results in low visibilities. The difference between a blizzard and a snowstorm is the strength of the wind, not the amount of snow. To be a blizzard, a snow storm must have sustained winds or frequent gusts that are greater than or equal to with blowing or drifting snow which reduces visibility to or less and must last for a prolonged period of time—typically three hours or more.

Environment Canada defines a blizzard as a storm with wind speeds exceeding accompanied by visibility of or less, resulting from snowfall, blowing snow, or a combination of the two. These conditions must persist for a period of at least four hours for the storm to be classified as a blizzard, except north of the arctic tree line, where that threshold is raised to six hours.
The Australia Bureau of Meteorology describes a blizzard as, &quot;Violent and very cold wind which is laden with snow, some part, at least, of which has been raised from snow covered ground.&quot;

While severe cold and large amounts of drifting snow may accompany blizzards, they are not required. Blizzards can bring whiteout conditions, and can paralyze regions for days at a time, particularly where snowfall is unusual or rare.

A severe blizzard has winds over , near zero visibility, and temperatures of or lower. In Antarctica, blizzards are associated with winds spilling over the edge of the ice plateau at an average velocity of .

Ground blizzard refers to a weather condition where loose snow or ice on the ground is lifted and blown by strong winds. The primary difference between a ground blizzard as opposed to a regular blizzard is that in a ground blizzard no precipitation is produced at the time, but rather all the precipitation is already present in the form of snow or ice at the surface.

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; concludes the term &quot;blizzard&quot; is likely onomatopoeic, derived from the same sense as &quot;blow, blast, blister, and bluster&quot;; the first recorded use of it for weather dates to 1829, when it was defined as a &quot;violent blow&quot;. It achieved its modern definition by 1859, when it was in use in the western United States. The term became common in the press during the harsh winter of 1880–81.

==United States storm systems==


In the United States, storm systems powerful enough to cause blizzards usually form when the jet stream dips far to the south, allowing cold, dry polar air from the north to clash with warm, humid air moving up from the south.

When cold, moist air from the Pacific Ocean moves eastward to the Rocky Mountains and the Great Plains, and warmer, moist air moves north from the Gulf of Mexico, all that is needed is a movement of cold polar air moving south to form potential blizzard conditions that may extend from the Texas Panhandle to the Great Lakes and Midwest. A blizzard also may be formed when a cold front and warm front mix together and a blizzard forms at the border line.

Another storm system occurs when a cold core low over the Hudson Bay area in Canada is displaced southward over southeastern Canada, the Great Lakes, and New England. When the rapidly moving cold front collides with warmer air coming north from the Gulf of Mexico, strong surface winds, significant cold air advection, and extensive wintry precipitation occur.

Low pressure systems moving out of the Rocky Mountains onto the Great Plains, a broad expanse of flat land, much of it covered in prairie, steppe and grassland, can cause thunderstorms and rain to the south and heavy snows and strong winds to the north. With few trees or other obstructions to reduce wind and blowing, this part of the country is particularly vulnerable to blizzards with very low temperatures and whiteout conditions. In a true whiteout, there is no visible horizon. People can become lost in their own front yards, when the door is only away, and they would have to feel their way back. Motorists have to stop their cars where they are, as the road is impossible to see.

===Nor&#x27;easter blizzards===
A nor&#x27;easter is a macro-scale storm that occurs off the New England and Atlantic Canada coastlines. It gets its name from the direction the wind is coming from. The usage of the term in North America comes from the wind associated with many different types of storms, some of which can form in the North Atlantic Ocean and some of which form as far south as the Gulf of Mexico. The term is most often used in the coastal areas of New England and Atlantic Canada. This type of storm has characteristics similar to a hurricane. More specifically, it describes a low-pressure area whose center of rotation is just off the coast and whose leading winds in the left-forward quadrant rotate onto land from the northeast. High storm waves may sink ships at sea and cause coastal flooding and beach erosion. Notable nor&#x27;easters include The Great Blizzard of 1888, one of the worst blizzards in U.S. history. It dropped of snow and had sustained winds of more than that produced snowdrifts in excess of . Railroads were shut down and people were confined to their houses for up to a week. It killed 400 people, mostly in New York.

==Historic events==

===1972 Iran blizzard===
The 1972 Iran blizzard, which caused 4,000 reported deaths, was the deadliest blizzard in recorded history. Dropping as much as of snow, it completely covered 200 villages. After a snowfall lasting nearly a week, an area the size of Wisconsin was entirely buried in snow.

===2008 Afghanistan blizzard===
The 2008 Afghanistan blizzard, was a fierce blizzard that struck Afghanistan on 10 January 2008. Temperatures fell to a low of , with up to of snow in the more mountainous regions, killing at least 926 people. It was the third deadliest blizzard in history. The weather also claimed more than 100,000 sheep and goats, and nearly 315,000 cattle died.

===The Snow Winter of 1880–1881===


The winter of 1880–1881 is widely considered the most severe winter ever known in many parts of the United States. 

The initial blizzard in October 1880 brought snowfalls so deep that two-story homes experienced &quot;accumulations&quot;, as opposed to drifts, up to their second-floor windows. No one was prepared for deep snow so early in the winter. Farmers from North Dakota to Virginia were caught flat with fields unharvested, what grain that had been harvested unmilled, and their suddenly all-important winter stocks of wood fuel only partially collected. By January train service was almost entirely suspended from the region. Railroads hired scores of men to dig out the tracks but as soon as they had finished shoveling a stretch of line a new storm arrived, burying it again.
There were no winter thaws and on February 2, 1881, a second massive blizzard struck that lasted for nine days. In towns the streets were filled with solid drifts to the tops of the buildings and tunneling was necessary to move about. Homes and barns were completely covered, compelling farmers to construct fragile tunnels in order to feed their stock.

When the snow finally melted in late spring of 1881, huge sections of the plains experienced flooding. Massive ice jams clogged the Missouri River, and when they broke the downstream areas were inundated. Most of the town of Yankton, in what is now South Dakota, was washed away when the river overflowed its banks after the thaw.

==== Novelization ====
Many children—and their parents—learned of &quot;The Snow Winter&quot; through the children&#x27;s book &quot;The Long Winter&quot; by Laura Ingalls Wilder, in which the author tells of her family&#x27;s efforts to survive. The snow arrived in October 1880 and blizzard followed blizzard throughout the winter and into March 1881, leaving many areas snowbound throughout the winter. Accurate details in Wilder&#x27;s novel include the blizzards&#x27; frequency and the deep cold, the Chicago and North Western Railway stopping trains until the spring thaw because the snow made the tracks impassable, the near-starvation of the townspeople, and the courage of her future husband Almanzo and another man, Cap Garland, who ventured out on the open prairie in search of a cache of wheat that no one was even sure existed.

===The Storm of the Century===
The Storm of the Century, also known as the Great Blizzard of 1993, was a large cyclonic storm that formed over the Gulf of Mexico on March 12, 1993, and dissipated in the North Atlantic Ocean on March 15. It is unique for its intensity, massive size and wide-reaching effect. At its height, the storm stretched from Canada towards Central America, but its main impact was on the United States and Cuba. The cyclone moved through the Gulf of Mexico, and then through the Eastern United States before moving into Canada. Areas as far south as northern Alabama and Georgia received a dusting of snow and areas such as Birmingham, Alabama, received up to with hurricane-force wind gusts and record low barometric pressures. Between Louisiana and Cuba, hurricane-force winds produced high storm surges across northwestern Florida, which along with scattered tornadoes killed dozens of people. In the United States, the storm was responsible for the loss of electric power to over 10 million customers. It is purported to have been directly experienced by nearly 40 percent of the country&#x27;s population at that time. A total of 310 people, including 10 from Cuba, perished during this storm. The storm cost $6 to $10 billion in damages.

*The Great Snow 1717 series of four snowstorms between February 27 and March 7, 1717. There were reports of about five feet of snow already on the ground when the first of the storms hit. By the end, there were about ten feet of snow and some drifts reaching , burying houses entirely. In the colonial era, this storm made travel impossible until the snow simply melted.
* Blizzard of 1765. March 24, 1765. Affected area from Philadelphia to Massachusetts. High winds and over of snowfall recorded in some areas.

* The &quot;Hessian Storm of 1778&quot;. December 26, 1778. Severe blizzard with high winds, heavy snows and bitter cold extending from Pennsylvania to New England. Snow drifts reported to be high in Rhode Island. Storm named for stranded Hessian troops in deep snows stationed in Rhode Island during the Revolutionary War.
* The Great Snow of 1786. December 4–10, 1786. Blizzard conditions and a succession of three harsh snowstorms produced snow depths of to from Pennsylvania to New England. Reportedly of similar magnitude of 1717 snowstorms.
* The Long Storm of 1798. November 19–21, 1798. Heavy snowstorm produced snow from Maryland to Maine.

==== 1800 to 1850 ====
* Blizzard of 1805. January 26–28, 1805. Cyclone brought heavy snowstorm to New York City and New England. Snow fell continuously for two days where over of snow accumulated.
* New York City Blizzard of 1811. December 23–24, 1811. Severe blizzard conditions reported on Long Island, in New York City, and southern New England. Strong winds and tides caused damage to shipping in harbor.
* Luminous Blizzard of 1817. January 17, 1817. In Massachusetts and Vermont, a severe snowstorm was accompanied by frequent lightning and heavy thunder. St. Elmo&#x27;s fire reportedly lit up trees, fence posts, house roofs, and even people. John Farrar professor at Harvard, recorded the event in his memoir in 1821.
* Great Snowstorm of 1821. January 5–7, 1821. Extensive snowstorm and blizzard spread from Virginia to New England.
* Winter of Deep Snow in 1830. December 29, 1830. Blizzard storm dumped in Kansas City and in Illinois. Areas experienced repeated storms thru mid-February 1831.

* &quot;The Big Snow of 1836&quot; January 8–10, 1836. Produced to of snowfall in interior New York, northern Pennsylvania, and western New England. Philadelphia got a reported and New York City of snow.

==== 1851 to 1900 ====
* Plains Blizzard of 1856. December 3–5, 1856. Severe blizzard-like storm raged for three days in Kansas and Iowa. Early pioneers suffered.
* &quot;The Cold Storm of 1857&quot; January 18–19, 1857. Produced severe blizzard conditions from North Carolina to Maine. Heavy snowfalls reported in east coast cities.
* Midwest Blizzard of 1864. January 1, 1864. Gale-force winds, driving snow, and low temperatures all struck simultaneously around Chicago, Wisconsin and Minnesota.
* Plains Blizzard of 1873. January 7, 1873. Severe blizzard struck the Great Plains. Many pioneers from the east were unprepared for the storm and perished in Minnesota and Iowa.
* Great Plains Easter Blizzard of 1873. April 13, 1873
* Seattle Blizzard of 1880. January 6, 1880. Seattle area&#x27;s greatest snowstorm to date. An estimated fell around the town. Many barns collapsed and all transportation halted.
* The Hard Winter of 1880-81. October 15, 1880. A blizzard in eastern South Dakota marked the beginning of this historically difficult season. Laura Ingalls Wilder&#x27;s book &quot;The Long Winter&quot; details the effects of this season on early settlers.
* In the three year winter period from December 1885 to March 1888, the Great Plains and Eastern United States suffered a series of the worst blizzards in this nation&#x27;s history ending with the Schoolhouse Blizzard and the Great Blizzard of 1888. The massive explosion of the volcano Krakatoa in the South Pacific late in August 1883 is a suspected cause of these huge blizzards during these several years. The clouds of ash it emitted continued to circulate around the world for many years. Weather patterns continued to be chaotic for years, and temperatures did not return to normal until 1888. Record rainfall was experienced in Southern California during July 1883 to June 1884. The Krakatoa eruption injected an unusually large amount of sulfur dioxide (SO2) gas high into the stratosphere which reflects sunlight and helped cool the planet over the next few years until the suspended atmospheric sulfur fell to ground.
* Plains Blizzard of late 1885. In Kansas, heavy snows of late 1885 had piled drifts high.
* Kansas Blizzard of 1886. First week of January 1886. Reported that 80 percent of the cattle were frozen to death in that state alone from the cold and snow.
* January 1886 Blizzard. January 9, 1886. Same system as Kansas 1886 Blizzard that traveled eastward.
* Great Plains Blizzards of late 1886. On November 13, 1886, it reportedly began to snow and did not stop for a month in the Great Plains region.
* Great Plains Blizzard of 1887. January 9–11, 1887. Reported 72-hour blizzard that covered parts of the Great Plains in more than of snow. Winds whipped and temperatures dropped to around . So many cows that were not killed by the cold soon died from starvation. When spring arrived, millions of the animals were dead, with around 90 percent of the open range&#x27;s cattle rotting where they fell. Those present reported carcasses as far as the eye could see. Dead cattle clogged up rivers and spoiled drinking water. Many ranchers went bankrupt and others simply called it quits and moved back east. The &quot;Great Die-Up&quot; from the blizzard effectively concluded the romantic period of the great Plains cattle drives.
*Schoolhouse Blizzard of 1888 North American Great Plains. January 12–13, 1888. What made the storm so deadly was the timing (during work and school hours), the suddenness, and the brief spell of warmer weather that preceded it. In addition, the very strong wind fields behind the cold front and the powdery nature of the snow reduced visibilities on the open plains to zero. People ventured from the safety of their homes to do chores, go to town, attend school, or simply enjoy the relative warmth of the day. As a result, thousands of people—including many schoolchildren—got caught in the blizzard.
*Great Blizzard of March 1888 March 11–14, 1888. One of the most severe recorded blizzards in the history of the United States. On March 12, an unexpected northeaster hit New England and the mid-Atlantic, dropping up to of snow in the space of three days. New York City experienced its heaviest snowfall recorded to date at that time, all street railcars were stranded, and the storm led to the creation of the NYC subway system. Snowdrifts reached up to the second story of some buildings. Some 400 people died from this blizzard, including many sailors aboard vessels that were beset by gale-force winds and turbulent seas.
*Great Blizzard of 1899 February 11–14, 1899. An extremely unusual blizzard in that it reached into the far southern states of the US. It hit in February, and the area around Washington, D.C., experienced 51 hours straight of snowfall. The port of New Orleans was totally iced over; revelers participating in the New Orleans Mardi Gras had to wait for the parade routes to be shoveled free of snow. Concurrent with this blizzard was the extremely cold arctic air. Many city and state record low temperatures date back to this event, including all-time records for locations in the Midwest and South. State record lows: Nebraska reached , Ohio experienced , Louisiana bottomed out at , and Florida dipped below zero to .

This &quot;Panhandle hook&quot; winter storm cut a through the middle of the country from Kansas to Michigan. The morning of the storm was unseasonably warm but by mid afternoon conditions quickly deteriorated into a raging blizzard that would last into the next day. A total of 145 deaths were blamed on the storm, almost a third of them duck hunters who had taken time off to take advantage of the ideal hunting conditions. Weather forecasters had not predicted the severity of the oncoming storm, and as a result the hunters were not dressed for cold weather. When the storm began many hunters took shelter on small islands in the Mississippi River, and the winds and waves overcame their encampments. Some became stranded on the islands and then froze to death in the single-digit temperatures that moved in over night. Others tried to make it to shore and drowned.
*North American blizzard of 1947 December 25–26, 1947. Was a record-breaking snowfall that began on Christmas Day and brought the Northeast United States to a standstill. Central Park in New York City got of snowfall in 24 hours with deeper snows in suburbs. It was not accompanied by high winds, but the snow fell steadily with drifts reaching . Seventy-seven deaths were attributed to the blizzard.
* The Blizzard of 1949 - The first blizzard started on Sunday, January 2, 1949; it lasted for three days. It was followed by two more months of blizzard after blizzard with high winds and bitter cold. Deep drifts isolated southeast Wyoming, northern Colorado, western South Dakota and western Nebraska, for weeks. Railroad tracks and roads were all drifted in with drifts of and more. Hundreds of people that had been traveling on trains were stranded. Motorists that had set out on January 2 found their way to private farm homes in rural areas and hotels and other buildings in towns; some dwellings were so crowded that there was not enough room for all to sleep at once. It would be weeks before they were plowed out. The Federal government quickly responded with aid, airlifting food and hay for livestock. The total rescue effort involved numerous volunteers and local agencies plus at least ten major state and federal agencies from the U.S. Army to the National Park Service. Private businesses, including railroad and oil companies, also lent manpower and heavy equipment to the work of plowing out. The official death toll was 76 people and one million livestock.

<doc id="4550" wikidata="Q14090" url="?curid=4550" title="Bikini">
<text>A bikini is a two-piece swimsuit primarily worn by women that features one piece on top that covers the breasts, and a second piece on the bottom: the front covering the pelvis but usually exposing the navel, and the back generally covering the intergluteal cleft and some or all of the buttocks. The size of the top and bottom can vary, from bikinis that offer full coverage of the breasts, pelvis, and buttocks, to more revealing designs with a thong or G-string bottom that covers only the mons pubis, but exposes the buttocks, and a top that covers only the areolae. Bikini bottoms covering about half the buttocks may be described as &quot;Brazilian-cut&quot;.

The modern bikini swimsuit was introduced by French clothing designer Louis Réard in July 1946, and was named after the Bikini Atoll, where the first public test of a nuclear bomb had taken place four days before.

Due to its revealing design, the bikini was once considered controversial, facing opposition from a number of groups and being accepted only very slowly by the general public. In many countries, the design was banned from beaches and other public places: in 1949, France banned the bikini from being worn on its coastlines; Germany banned the bikini from public swimming pools until the 1970s, and some communist groups condemned the bikini as a &quot;capitalist decadence&quot;. The bikini also faced criticism from some feminists, who reviled it as a garment designed to suit men&#x27;s tastes, and not those of women. Despite this backlash, however, the bikini still sold well throughout the mid to late 20th century.

The bikini gained increased exposure and acceptance as film stars like Brigitte Bardot, Raquel Welch, and Ursula Andress wore it and were photographed on public beaches and seen in film. The minimalist bikini design became common in most Western countries by the mid-1960s as both swimwear and underwear. By the late 20th century, it was widely used as sportswear in beach volleyball and bodybuilding. There are a number of modern stylistic variations of the design used for marketing purposes and as industry classifications, including monokini, microkini, tankini, trikini, pubikini, skirtini, thong, and g-string. A man&#x27;s single piece brief swimsuit may also be called a bikini or &quot;bikini brief&quot;, particularly if it has slimmer sides. Similarly, a variety of men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s underwear types are described as bikini underwear. The bikini has gradually gained wide acceptance in Western society. By the early 2000s, bikinis had become a US$811 million business annually, and boosted spin off services such as bikini waxing and sun tanning.

== Etymology and terminology ==
While the two-piece swimsuit as a design existed in classical antiquity, the modern design first attracted public notice in Paris on July 5, 1946. 

In May 1946, Parisian fashion designer Jacques Heim released a two-piece swimsuit design that he named the (&#x27;Atom&#x27;) and advertised as &quot;the smallest swimsuit in the world&quot;. Like swimsuits of the era, it covered the wearer&#x27;s belly button, and it failed to attract much attention. French automotive engineer Louis Réard introduced a design he named the &quot;Bikini&quot;, adopting the name from the Bikini Atoll in the Pacific Ocean, which was the colonial name the Germans gave to the atoll, borrowed from the Marshallese name for the island, . Four days earlier, on 1 July 1946, the United States had initiated its first peacetime nuclear weapons test at Bikini Atoll as part of Operation Crossroads. Unlike the prior Trinity test, or most subsequent nuclear test series, the United States allowed both international observers and the global press to observe Crossroads, creating an intense international interest in the new weapon and its testing. Réard never explained why he chose the name &quot;Bikini&quot; for the swimsuit. Various motivations have been attributed to his choosing of the name, including the idea that he hoped it would create &quot;explosive commercial and cultural reaction&quot; similar to the explosion at Bikini Atoll, that it was meant to be associated with the &quot;exotic allure of the tropical Pacific&quot;, from the &quot;comparison of the effects of a scantily clad woman to the atomic bomb,&quot; and the idea that Reard&#x27;s design had out-done Heim&#x27;s design and &quot;split the &quot;atome&quot;&quot;. Réard&#x27;s advertising slogan was that the Bikini was &quot;smaller than the smallest bathing suit in the world.&quot; The swimsuit&#x27;s name was typically capitalized for several years after its coining.

It has been frequently cited as a major example of a &quot;psychological link between atomic destruction and sexuality&quot; in popular culture, which includes the stenciling of Rita Hayworth onto one of the bombs detonated at Crossroads, and its persistence in language has been argued as having &quot;trivialized and downplayed the reality of nuclear testing,&quot; given the contamination done by especially later US thermonuclear tests at Bikini and other Marshallese atolls.

By making an analogy with words like &quot;bilingual&quot; and &quot;bilateral&quot; containing the Latin prefix &quot;bi-&quot; (meaning &quot;two&quot; in Latin), the word &quot;bikini&quot; was first back-derived as consisting of two parts, [&quot;bi&quot; + &quot;kini&quot;] by Rudi Gernreich, who introduced the monokini in 1964. Later swimsuit designs like the tankini and trikini further cemented this derivation. Over time the &quot;&quot;–kini&quot; family&quot; (as dubbed by author William Safire), including the &quot;&quot;–ini&quot; sisters&quot; (as dubbed by designer Anne Cole), expanded into a variety of swimwear including the monokini (also known as a numokini or unikini), seekini, tankini, camikini, (also hipkini), minikini, face-kini, burkini, and microkini. The &quot;Language Report&quot;, compiled by lexicographer Susie Dent and published by the Oxford University Press (OUP) in 2003, considers lexicographic inventions like bandeaukini and camkini, two variants of the tankini, important to observe. Although &quot;bikini&quot; was originally a registered trademark of Réard, it has since become genericized.

Variations of the term are used to describe stylistic variations for promotional purposes and industry classifications, including monokini, microkini, tankini, trikini, pubikini, bandeaukini and skirtini. A man&#x27;s brief swimsuit may also be referred to as a bikini. Similarly, a variety of men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s underwear types are described as bikini underwear.

== History ==

=== In antiquity ===
According to archaeologist James Mellaart, a mural from the Chalcolithic era (around 5600 BC) in Çatalhöyük, Anatolia depicts a mother goddess astride two leopards wearing a costume somewhat like a bikini. The two-piece swimsuit can be traced back to the Greco-Roman world, where bikini-like garments worn by women athletes are depicted on urns and paintings dating back to 1400 BC.

In &quot;Coronation of the Winner,&quot; a mosaic in the floor of a Roman villa in Sicily that dates from the Diocletian period (286–305 AD), young women participate in weightlifting, discus throwing, and running ball games dressed in bikini-like garments (technically bandeaukinis in modern lexicon). The mosaic, found in the Sicilian Villa Romana del Casale, features ten maidens who have been anachronistically dubbed the &quot;Bikini Girls&quot;. Other Roman archaeological finds depict the goddess Venus in a similar garment. In Pompeii, depictions of Venus wearing a bikini were discovered in the Casa della Venere, in the &quot;tablinum&quot; of the House of Julia Felix, and in an atrium garden of Via Dell&#x27;Abbondanza.

=== Precursors in the West ===
Swimming or bathing outdoors was discouraged in the Christian West, so there was little demand or need for swimming or bathing costumes until the 18th century. The bathing gown of the 18th century was a loose ankle-length full-sleeve chemise-type gown made of wool or flannel that retained coverage and modesty.

In 1907, Australian swimmer and performer Annette Kellermann was arrested on a Boston beach for wearing form-fitting sleeveless one-piece knitted swimming tights that covered her from neck to toe, a costume she adopted from England, although it became accepted swimsuit attire for women in parts of Europe by 1910. In 1913, designer Carl Jantzen made the first functional two-piece swimwear. Inspired by the introduction of females into Olympic swimming he designed a close-fitting costume with shorts for the bottom and short sleeves for the top.

During the 1920s and 1930s, people began to shift from &quot;taking in the water&quot; to &quot;taking in the sun&quot;, at bathhouses and spas, and swimsuit designs shifted from functional considerations to incorporate more decorative features. Rayon was used in the 1920s in the manufacture of tight-fitting swimsuits, but durability issues, especially when wet, proved problematic. Jersey and silk were also sometimes used. By the 1930s, manufacturers had lowered necklines in the back, removed sleeves, and tightened the sides. With the development of new clothing materials, particularly latex and nylon, swimsuits gradually began hugging the body through the 1930s, with shoulder straps that could be lowered for tanning.

Women&#x27;s swimwear of the 1930s and 1940s incorporated increasing degrees of midriff exposure. The 1932 Hollywood film &quot;Three on a Match&quot; featured a midriff-baring two-piece bathing suit. Actress Dolores del Río was the first major star to wear a two-piece women&#x27;s bathing suit onscreen in &quot;Flying Down to Rio&quot; (1933).

Teen magazines of late 1940s and 1950s featured similar designs of midriff-baring suits and tops. However, midriff fashion was stated as only for beaches and informal events and considered indecent to be worn in public. Hollywood endorsed the new glamor in films like 1949&#x27;s &quot;Neptune&#x27;s Daughter&quot; in which Esther Williams wore provocatively named costumes such as &quot;Double Entendre&quot; and &quot;Honey Child&quot;.

Wartime production during World War II required vast amounts of cotton, silk, nylon, wool, leather, and rubber. In 1942, the United States War Production Board issued Regulation L-85, cutting the use of natural fibers in clothing and mandating a 10% reduction in the amount of fabric in women&#x27;s beachwear. To comply with the regulations, swimsuit manufacturers removed skirt panels and other attachments, while increasing production of the two-piece swimsuit with bare midriffs. At the same time, demand for all swimwear declined as there was not much interest in going to the beach, especially in Europe.

=== Modern bikini ===

In the summer of 1946, Western Europeans enjoyed their first war-free summer in many years. French designers sought to deliver fashions that matched the liberated mood of the people. Fabric was still in short supply, and in an endeavor to resurrect swimwear sales, two French designers – Jacques Heim and Louis Réard – almost simultaneously launched new two-piece swimsuit designs in 1946. Heim launched a two-piece swimsuit design in Paris that he called the &quot;atome&quot;, after the smallest known particle of matter. He announced that it was the &quot;world&#x27;s smallest bathing suit.&quot; Although briefer than the two-piece swimsuits of the 1930s, the bottom of Heim&#x27;s new two-piece beach costume still covered the wearer&#x27;s navel.

Soon after, Louis Réard created a competing two-piece swimsuit design, which he called the &quot;bikini&quot;. He noticed that women at the beach rolled up the edges of their swimsuit bottoms and tops to improve their tan. On 5 July, Réard introduced his design at a swimsuit review held at a popular Paris public pool, Piscine Molitor, four days after the first test of a US nuclear weapon at the Bikini Atoll. The newspapers were full of news about it and Réard hoped for the same with his design. Réard&#x27;s &quot;bikini&quot; undercut Heim&#x27;s &quot;atome&quot; in its brevity. His design consisted of two side-by-side triangles of fabric forming a bra, and two front-and-back triangular pieces of fabric covering the mons pubis and the buttocks, respectively, connected by string. When he was unable to find a fashion model willing to showcase his revealing design, Réard hired Micheline Bernardini, an 18-year old nude dancer from the Casino de Paris. He announced that his swimsuit, was &quot;smaller than the world&#x27;s smallest bathing suit&quot;. Réard said that &quot;like the [atom] bomb, the bikini is small and devastating&quot;. Fashion writer Diana Vreeland described the bikini as the &quot;atom bomb of fashion&quot;. Bernardini received 50,000 fan letters, many of them from men.

Photographs of Bernardini and articles about the event were widely carried by the press. The &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; alone ran nine stories on the event. French newspaper &quot;Le Figaro&quot; wrote, &quot;People were craving the simple pleasures of the sea and the sun. For women, wearing a bikini signaled a kind of second liberation. There was really nothing sexual about this. It was instead a celebration of freedom and a return to the joys in life.&quot;

Heim&#x27;s &quot;atome&quot; was more in keeping with the sense of propriety of the 1940s, but Réard&#x27;s design won the public&#x27;s attention. Although Heim&#x27;s design was the first worn on the beach and initially sold more swimsuits, it was Réard&#x27;s description of the two-piece swimsuit as a &quot;bikini&quot; that stuck. As competing designs emerged, he declared in advertisements that a swimsuit could not be a genuine bikini &quot;unless it could be pulled through a wedding ring.&quot; Modern bikinis were first made of cotton and jersey.

=== Social resistance ===
Despite the garment&#x27;s initial success in France, women worldwide continued to wear traditional one-piece swimsuits. When his sales stalled, Réard went back to designing and selling orthodox knickers. In 1950, American swimsuit mogul Fred Cole, owner of mass market swimwear firm Cole of California, told &quot;Time&quot; that he had &quot;little but scorn for France&#x27;s famed Bikinis.&quot; Réard himself would later describe it as a &quot;two-piece bathing suit which reveals everything about a girl except for her mother&#x27;s maiden name.&quot; Fashion magazine &quot;Modern Girl Magazine&quot; in 1957 stated that &quot;it is hardly necessary to waste words over the so-called bikini since it is inconceivable that any girl with tact and decency would ever wear such a thing&quot;.

In 1951, Eric Morley organized the &quot;Festival Bikini Contest&quot;, a beauty contest and swimwear advertising opportunity at that year&#x27;s Festival of Britain. The press, welcoming the spectacle, referred to it as &quot;Miss World&quot;, a name Morley registered as a trademark. The winner was Kiki Håkansson of Sweden, who was crowned in a bikini. After the crowning, Håkansson was condemned by Pope Pius XII, while Spain and Ireland threatened to withdraw from the pageant. In 1952, bikinis were banned from the pageant and replaced by evening gowns. As a result of the controversy, the bikini was explicitly banned from many other beauty pageants worldwide. Although some regarded the bikini and beauty contests as bringing freedom to women, they were opposed by some feminists as well as religious and cultural groups who objected to the degree of exposure of the female body.

Paula Stafford was an Australian fashion designer credited with introducing the bikini to Australia; in a famous incident in 1952, model Ann Ferguson was asked to leave a beach in Surfers Paradise because her Paula Stafford bikini was too revealing. The bikini was banned in Australia, on the French Atlantic coastline, in Spain, in Italy, and in Portugal, and was prohibited or discouraged in a number of US states. The United States Motion Picture Production Code, also known as the Hays Code, enforced from 1934, allowed two-piece gowns but prohibited the display of navels in Hollywood films. The National Legion of Decency, a Roman Catholic body overseeing American media content, also pressured Hollywood and foreign film producers to keep bikinis from being featured in Hollywood movies. As late as 1959 one of the United States&#x27; largest swimsuit designers, Anne Cole of the Anne Cole brand, said, &quot;It&#x27;s nothing more than a G-string. It&#x27;s at the razor&#x27;s edge of decency.&quot; The Hays Code was abandoned by the mid-1960s, and with it the prohibition of female navel exposure, as well as other restrictions. The influence of the National Legion of Decency also waned by the 1960s.

=== Rise to popularity ===
Increasingly common glamour shots of popular actresses and models on either side of the Atlantic played a large part in bringing the bikini into the mainstream. During the 1950s, Hollywood stars such as Ava Gardner, Rita Hayworth, Lana Turner, Elizabeth Taylor, Tina Louise, Marilyn Monroe, Esther Williams, and Betty Grable took advantage of the risqué publicity associated with the bikini by posing for photographs wearing them—pin-ups of Hayworth and Williams in costume were especially widely distributed in the United States. In 1950, Elvira Pagã walked at the Rio Carnival, Brazil in a golden bikini, starting the bikini tradition of the carnival.

In Europe, 17-year-old Brigitte Bardot wore scanty bikinis (by contemporary standards) in the French film &quot;Manina, la fille sans voiles&quot; (&quot;Manina, the girl unveiled&quot;). The promotion for the film, released in France in March 1953, drew more attention to Bardot&#x27;s bikinis than to the film itself. By the time the film was released in the United States in 1958, it was re-titled &quot;Manina, the Girl in the Bikini&quot;. Bardot was also photographed wearing a bikini on the beach during the 1957 Cannes Film Festival. Working with her husband and agent Roger Vadim, she garnered significant attention with photographs of her wearing a bikini on every beach in the south of France.

Similar photographs were taken of Anita Ekberg and Sophia Loren, among others. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Bardot&#x27;s photographs in particular turned Saint-Tropez into the beachwear capital of the world, with Bardot identified as the original Cannes bathing beauty. Bardot&#x27;s photography helped to enhance the public profile of the festival, and Cannes in turn played a crucial role in her career.

Brian Hyland&#x27;s novelty-song hit &quot;Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini&quot; became a &quot;Billboard&quot; No. 1 hit during the summer of 1960: the song tells a story about a young girl who is too shy to wear her new bikini on the beach, thinking it too risqué. &quot;Playboy&quot; first featured a bikini on its cover in 1962; the &quot;Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue&quot; debut two years later featured Babette March in a white bikini on the cover. This has been credited with making the bikini a legitimate piece of clothing.

Ursula Andress, appearing as Honey Ryder in the 1962 British James Bond film, &quot;Dr. No&quot;, wore a white bikini, which became known as the &quot;Dr. No bikini&quot;. It became one of the most famous bikinis of all time and an iconic moment in cinematic and fashion history. Andress said that she owed her career to that white bikini, remarking, &quot;This bikini made me into a success. As a result of starring in &quot;Dr. No&quot; as the first Bond girl, I was given the freedom to take my pick of future roles and to become financially independent.&quot;

The bikini finally caught on, and in 1963, the movie &quot;Beach Party&quot;, starring Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon, led a wave of films that made the bikini a pop-culture symbol, though Funicello was barred from wearing Réard&#x27;s bikini unlike the other young females in the films. In 1965, a woman told &quot;Time&quot; that it was &quot;almost square&quot; not to wear a bikini; the magazine wrote two years later that &quot;65% of the young set had already gone over&quot;.

Raquel Welch&#x27;s fur bikini in &quot;One Million Years B.C.&quot; (1966) gave the world the most iconic bikini shot of all time and the poster image became an iconic moment in cinema history. Her deer skin bikini in &quot;One Million Years B.C.&quot;, advertised as &quot;mankind&#x27;s first bikini&quot;, (1966) was later described as a &quot;definitive look of the 1960s&quot;. Her role wearing the leather bikini made Welch a fashion icon and the photo of her in the bikini became a best-selling pinup poster.

Stretch nylon bikini briefs and bras complemented the adolescent boutique fashions of the 1960s, allowing those to be minimal. DuPont introduced lycra (DuPont&#x27;s name for spandex) in the same decade. Spandex expanded the range of novelty fabrics available to designers which meant suits could be made to fit like a second skin without heavy linings. &quot;The advent of Lycra allowed more women to wear a bikini,&quot; wrote Kelly Killoren Bensimon, a former model and author of &quot;The Bikini Book&quot;, &quot;It didn&#x27;t sag, it didn&#x27;t bag, and it concealed and revealed. It wasn&#x27;t so much like lingerie anymore.&quot; Increased reliance on stretch fabric led to simplified construction. This fabric allowed designers to create the string bikini, and allowed Rudi Gernreich to create the topless monokini. Alternative swimwear fabrics such as velvet, leather, and crocheted squares surfaced in the early &#x27;70s.

=== Mass acceptance ===

Réard&#x27;s company folded in 1988, four years after his death. Meanwhile, the bikini had become the most popular beachwear around the globe. According to French fashion historian Olivier Saillard, this was due to &quot;the power of women, and not the power of fashion&quot;. By 1988 the bikini made up nearly 20% of swimsuit sales, more than any other model in the US, though one-piece suits made a comeback during the 1980s and early 1990s. In 1997, Miss Maryland Jamie Fox became the first contestant in 50 years to compete in a two-piece swimsuit at the Miss America Pageant. Actresses in action films like &quot;Blue Crush&quot; (2002) and &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels: Full Throttle&quot; (2003) made the two-piece &quot;the millennial equivalent of the power suit&quot;, according to Gina Bellafonte of &quot;The New York Times.&quot;According to Beth Dincuff Charleston, research associate at the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, &quot;The bikini represents a social leap involving body consciousness, moral concerns, and sexual attitudes.&quot; By the early 2000s, bikinis had become a $811 million business annually, according to the NPD Group, a consumer and retail information company, and had boosted spin-off services like bikini waxing and the sun tanning industries. The first bikini museum in the world is being built in Bad Rappenau in Germany. The development of swimwear from 1880 to the present is presented on 2,000 square metres of exhibition space.

By 2017, the global swimwear market was valued at US$18,5 billion with a compound annual growth rate of 6.2%. Part of the increased consumption of bikinis and swimwears can be attributed to influencers who promote and endorse various brands around the year. Soccer player and best selling author Mo Isom describes it as, &quot;We&#x27;re flooded with Instagram bikini pics.&quot; It was estimated in 2016 that in 2019 the USA would be the largest swimwear market (US$10 billion), followed by Europe (US$5 billion), Asia–Pacific (US$4 billion) and Middle East and Africa (about 1 billion).


=== Outside the Western world ===
The 1967 Bollywood film &quot;An Evening in Paris&quot; is mostly remembered because it featured actress Sharmila Tagore as the first Indian actress to wear a bikini on film. She also posed in a bikini for the glossy &quot;Filmfare&quot; magazine. The costume shocked a conservative Indian audience, but it also set in motion a trend carried forward by Zeenat Aman in &quot;Heera Panna&quot; (1973) and &quot;Qurbani&quot; (1980), Dimple Kapadia in &quot;Bobby&quot; (1973), and Parveen Babi in &quot;Yeh Nazdeekiyan&quot; (1982). Indonesian actress Nurnaningsih&#x27;s bikini clad photos were widely distributed in early 1950s, though she was banned in Kalimantan.

Indian women generally wear bikinis when they vacation abroad or in Goa without the family. But, despite the conservative ideas prevalent in India, bikinis also become more popular in summer when women, from Bollywood stars to the middle class, take up swimming, often in a public space. A lot of tankinis, shorts and single-piece swimsuits are sold in the summer, along with real bikinis and bandeaukinis. The maximum sales for bikinis happen in the winter, the honeymoon season. For more coverage, designers Shivan Bhatiya and Narresh Kukreja invented the bikini-saree popularised by TV anchor Mandira Bedi.

By the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the Chinese bikini industry became a serious international threat for the Brazilian bikini industry. Huludao, Liaoning, China set the world record for the largest bikini parade in 2012, with 1,085 participants and a photo shoot involving 3,090 women. &quot;Beijing bikini&quot; refers to the Chinese urban practice of men rolling up their shirts to expose their midriff to cool off in public in the summer. In Japan, wearing a bikini is common on the beach and at baths or pools. But, according to a 2013 study, 94% women are not body confident enough to wear a bikini in public without resorting to sarongs, zip-up sweatshirts, T-shirts, or shorts. Japanese women also often wear a &quot;facekini&quot; to protect their face from sunburns.

In most parts of the Middle East, bikinis are either banned or are highly controversial. On March 18, 1973, when Lebanese magazine &quot;Ash-Shabaka&quot; printed a bikini-clad woman on the cover, they had to make a second version with only the face of the model. In 2011, when Huda Naccache (Miss Earth 2011) posed for the cover of &quot;Lilac&quot; (based in Israel), she became the first bikini-clad Arab model on the cover of an Arabic magazine. Lebanese-Australian fashion designer Aheda Zanetti created the &quot;burkini&quot; as a modest option to the bikini, which has become very popular among Muslims. Rehab Shaaban, an Egyptian designer, tried an even more abaya-like design, but her design was banned due to safety reasons.

== Variants ==
While the name &quot;bikini&quot; was at first applied only to beachwear that revealed the wearer&#x27;s navel, today the fashion industry considers any two-piece swimsuit a bikini. Modern bikini fashions are characterized by a simple, brief design: two triangles of fabric that form a bra and cover the woman&#x27;s breasts and a third that forms a panty cut below the navel that covers the groin and the intergluteal cleft.

Bikinis can and have been made out of almost every possible clothing material, and the fabrics and other materials used to make bikinis are an essential element of their design. Modern bikinis were first made of cotton and jersey, but in the 1960s, Lycra became the common material. Alternative swimwear fabrics such as velvet, leather, and crocheted squares surfaced in the early 1970s.

In a single fashion show in 1985, there were two-piece suits with cropped tank tops instead of the usual skimpy bandeaux, suits that resembled bikinis from the front and one-pieces from the back, suspender straps, ruffles, and deep navel-baring cutouts. Metal and stone jewelry pieces are now often used to dress up look and style according to tastes. To meet the fast pace of demands, some manufacturers now offer made-to-order bikinis ready in as few as seven minutes. The world&#x27;s most expensive bikini was designed in February 2006 by Susan Rosen; containing of diamond, it was valued at £20 million.
=== Major styles ===
There is a range of distinct bikini styles available — string/tie-side bikinis, monokinis (topless or top and bottom connected), trikinis (three pieces instead of two), tankinis (tank top, bikini bottom), camikinis (camisole top, bikini bottom), bandeaukinis (bandeau top, bikini bottom), skirtinis (bikini top, skirt bottom), microkinis, sling bikinis (or suspender bikinis), thong and g-string bikinis, and teardrop bikinis.

== In sport ==
Bikinis have become a major component of marketing various women&#x27;s sports. It is an official uniform for beach volleyball and is widely worn in athletics and other sports. Sports bikinis have gained popularity since the 1990s. However, the trend has raised significant criticism in recent years among people who view it as an attempt to sell sex. Female swimmers do not commonly wear bikinis in competitive swimming. The International Swimming Federation (FINA) voted to prohibit female swimmers from racing in bikinis in its meeting at Rome in 1960.

=== Beach volleyball ===
In 1994, the bikini became the official uniform of women&#x27;s Olympic beach volleyball. In 1999, the International Volleyball Federation (FIVB) standardized beach volleyball uniforms, with the bikini becoming the required uniform for women. That regulation bottom is called a &quot;bun-hugger&quot;, and players names are often written on the back of the bottom.

The uniform made its Olympic debut at Bondi Beach, Sydney during the 2000 Summer Olympics amid some criticism. It was the fifth largest television audience of all the sports at the 2000 Games. Much of the interest was because of the sex appeal of bikini-clad players along with their athletic ability. Bikini-clad dancers and cheerleaders entertain the audience during match breaks in many beach volleyball tournaments, including the Olympics. Even indoor volleyball costumes followed suit to become smaller and tighter.

However, the FIVB&#x27;s mandating of the bikini ran into problems. Some sports officials consider it exploitative and impractical in colder weather. It also drew the ire of some athletes. At the 2006 Asian Games at Doha, Qatar, only one Muslim country – Iraq – fielded a team in the beach volleyball competition because of concerns that the uniform was inappropriate. They refused to wear bikinis. The weather during the evening games in 2012 London Olympics was so cold that the players sometimes had to wear shirts and leggings. Earlier in 2012, FIVB had announced it would allow shorts (maximum length above the knee) and sleeved tops at the games. Richard Baker, the federation spokesperson, said that &quot;many of these countries have religious and cultural requirements so the uniform needed to be more flexible&quot;.

The bikini remains preferred by most players and corporate sponsors. US women&#x27;s team has cited several advantages of bikini uniforms, such as comfort while playing on sand during hot weather. Competitors Natalie Cook and Holly McPeak support the bikini as a practical uniform for a sport played on sand during the heat of summer. Olympic gold medal winner Kerry Walsh said, &quot;I love our uniforms.&quot; According to fellow gold medalist Misty May-Treanor and Walsh it does not restrict movement.

One feminist viewpoint sees the bikini uniform as objectification of women athletes. US beach volleyball player Gabrielle Reece described the bikini bottoms as uncomfortable with constant &quot;yanking and fiddling.&quot; Many female beach volleyball players have sustained injuries by over-training the abdominal muscles while many others have gone through augmentation mammoplasty to look appealing in their uniforms. Australian competitor Nicole Sanderson said about match break entertainment that &quot;it&#x27;s kind of disrespectful to the female players. I&#x27;m sure the male spectators love it, but I find it a little bit offensive.&quot;

Sports journalism expert Kimberly Bissell conducted a study on the camera angles used during the 2004 Summer Olympics beach volleyball games. Bissell found that 20% of the camera angles were focused on the women&#x27;s chests, and 17% on their buttocks. Bissell theorized that the appearance of the players draws fans attention more than their actual athleticism.
Sports commentator Jeanne Moos commented, &quot;Beach volleyball has now joined go-go girl dancing as perhaps the only two professions where a bikini is the required uniform.&quot; British Olympian Denise Johns argues that the regulation uniform is intended to be &quot;sexy&quot; and to attract attention. Rubén Acosta, president of the FIVB, says that it makes the game more appealing to spectators.

=== Bodybuilding ===
From the 1950s to mid-1970s, men&#x27;s bodybuilding contest formats were often supplemented with women&#x27;s beauty contests or bikini shows. The winners earned titles like Miss Body Beautiful, Miss Physical Fitness and Miss Americana, and also presented trophies to the winners of the men&#x27;s contest. In the 1980s, the Ms Olympia competition started in the US and in the UK the NABBA (National Amateur Body Building Association) renamed Miss Bikini International to Ms Universe. In 1986, the Ms Universe competition was divided into two sections – &quot;physique&quot; (for a more muscular physique) and &quot;figure&quot; (traditional feminine presentation in high heels). In November 2010 the IFBBF (International Federation of BodyBuilding &amp; Fitness) introduced a women&#x27;s bikini contest for women who do not wish to build their muscles to figure competition levels.

Costumes are regulation &quot;posing trunks&quot; (bikini briefs) for both men and women. Female bodybuilders in America are prohibited from wearing thongs or T-back swimsuits in contests filmed for television, though they are allowed to do so by certain fitness organizations in closed events. For men, the dress code specifies &quot;swim trunks only (no shorts, cut-off pants, or Speedos).&quot;

=== Other sports ===
Women in athletics often wear bikinis of similar size as those worn in beach volleyball. Amy Acuff, a US high-jumper, wore a black leather bikini instead of a track suit at the 2000 Summer Olympics. Runner Florence Griffith-Joyner mixed bikini bottoms with one-legged tights at the 1988 Summer Olympics, earning her more attention than her record-breaking performance in the women&#x27;s 200 meters event. In the 2007 South Pacific Games, the rules were adjusted to allow players to wear less revealing shorts and cropped sports tops instead of bikinis. At the 2006 Asian Games, organizers banned bikini-bottoms for female athletes and asked them to wear long shorts.

String bikinis and other revealing clothes are common in surfing, though most surfing bikinis are more robust with more coverage than sunning bikinis. &quot;Surfing Magazine&quot; printed a pictorial of Kymberly Herrin, &quot;Playboy&quot; Playmate March 1981, surfing in a revealing bikini, and eventually started an annual bikini issue. The Association of Surfing Professionals often pairs female surf meets with bikini contests, an issue that divides the female pro-surfing community into two parts. It has often been more profitable to win the bikini contest than the female surfing event.

In 2021, the Norway women&#x27;s national beach handball team was fined €1500 for being improperly dressed after the women wore bike shorts instead of bikini bottoms at a European championship match in Bulgaria. Critics derided the fine and the underlying rule. Norway&#x27;s minister for culture and sport Abid Raja described the fine as being &quot;completely ridiculous&quot;. Former tennis champion Billie Jean King supported the team tweeting &quot;The sexualisation of women athletes must stop&quot;. Although the Norwegian Handball Federation announced they would pay the fines, pop singer Pink offered to pay for them. Later, in November 2021, the International Handball Federation changed their dress rules to allow female players to wear some kinds of shorts, specifying &quot;Female athletes must wear short tight pants with a close fit&quot;.

== Body ideals ==

In 1950, American swimsuit mogul Fred Cole, owner of Cole of California, told &quot;Time&quot; that bikinis were designed for &quot;diminutive Gallic women&quot;, as because &quot;French girls have short legs... swimsuits have to be hiked up at the sides to make their legs look longer.&quot; In 1961, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported the opinion that the bikini is permissible for people who are not &quot;too fat or too thin&quot;. In the 1960s etiquette writer Emily Post decreed that &quot;[A bikini] is for perfect figures only, and for the very young.&quot; In &quot;The Bikini Book&quot; by Kelly Killoren Bensimon, swimwear designer Norma Kamali says, &quot;Anyone with a tummy&quot; should not wear a bikini. Since then, a number of bikini designers including Malia Mills have encouraged women of all ages and body types to take up the style. The 1970s saw the rise of the lean ideal of female body and figures like Cheryl Tiegs. Her figure remained in vogue in the 21st century.

The fitness boom of the 1980s led to one of the biggest leaps in the evolution of the bikini. According to Mills, &quot;The leg line became superhigh, the front was superlow, and the straps were superthin.&quot; Women&#x27;s magazines used terms like &quot;Bikini Belly&quot;, and workout programs were launched to develop a &quot;bikini-worthy body&quot;. The tiny &quot;fitness-bikinis&quot; made of lycra were launched to cater to this hardbodied ideal. Movies like &quot;Blue Crush&quot; and TV reality shows like &quot;Surf Girls&quot; merged the concepts of bikini models and athletes together, further accentuating the toned body ideal. Motivated by yearly Spring Break festivities that mark the start of the bikini season in North America, many women diet in an attempt to achieve the ideal bikini body; some take this to extremes including self-starvation, leading to eating disorders.

In 1993, Suzy Menkes, then Fashion Editor of the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;, suggested that women had begun to &quot;revolt&quot; against the &quot;body ideal&quot; and bikini &quot;exposure.&quot; She wrote, &quot;Significantly, on the beaches as on the streets, some of the youngest and prettiest women (who were once the only ones who dared to bare) seem to have decided that exposure is over.&quot; Nevertheless, former professional beach volleyball player Gabrielle Reece, who competed in a bikini, claimed that &quot;confidence&quot; alone can make a bikini sexy. One survey commissioned by Diet Chef, a UK home delivery service, reported by &quot;The Today Show&quot; and ridiculed by &quot;More&quot; magazine, showed that women should stop wearing bikinis by the age of 47.

== Bikini underwear ==
Certain types of underwear are described as bikini underwear and are designed for men and women. For women, bikini or bikini-style underwear is underwear that is similar in size and form to a regular bikini. It can refer to virtually any undergarment that provides less coverage to the midriff than lingerie, panties or knickers, especially suited to clothing such as crop tops. For men, bikini briefs are underpants that resemble women&#x27;s bikini bottoms, being smaller and more revealing than men&#x27;s classic briefs. Men&#x27;s bikini briefs can be low- or high-side that are usually lower than the true waist, often at hips, and usually have no access pouch or flap, nor leg bands at tops of thighs. String bikini briefs have front and rear sections that meet in the crotch but not at the waistband, with no fabric on the side of the legs.

Swimwear and underwear have similar design considerations, both being form-fitting garments. The main difference is that, unlike underwear, swimwear is open to public view. The swimsuit was, and is, following underwear styles, and at about the same time that attitudes towards the bikini began to change, underwear underwent a redesign towards a minimal, unboned design that emphasized comfort first.

=== History ===
As the swimsuit was evolving, underwear also started to change. Between 1900 and 1940, swimsuit lengths followed the changes in underwear designs. In the 1920s women started discarding the corset, while the Cadole company of Paris started developing something they called the &quot;breast girdle&quot;. During the Great Depression, panties and bras became softly constructed and were made of various elasticized yarns making underwear fit like a second skin. By the 1930s underwear styles for both women and men were influenced by the new brief models of swimwear from Europe. Although the waistband was still above the navel, the leg openings of the panty brief were cut in an arc to rise from the crotch to the hip joint. The brief served as a template for most variations of panties for the rest of the century. Warner standardized the concept of Cup size in 1935. The first underwire bra was developed in 1938. Beginning in the late thirties, , a type of men&#x27;s briefs, were introduced, featuring very high-cut leg openings and a lower rise to the waistband. Howard Hughes designed a push-up bra to be worn by Jane Russell in &quot;The Outlaw&quot; in 1943, although Russell stated in interviews that she never wore the &#x27;contraption&#x27;. In 1950 Maidenform introduced the first official bust enhancing bra.

By the 1960s, the bikini swimsuit influenced panty styles and coincided with the cut of the new lower rise jeans and pants. In the seventies, with the emergence of skintight jeans, thong versions of the panty became mainstream, since the open, stringed back eliminated any tell-tale panty lines across the rear and hips. By the 1980s the design of the French-cut panty pushed the waistband back up to the natural waistline and the rise of the leg openings was nearly as high (French Cut panties come up to the waist, has a high cut leg, and usually are full in the rear). As with the bra and other type of lingerie, manufacturers of the last quarter of the century marketed panty styles that were designed primarily for their sexual allure. From this decade sexualization and eroticization of the male body was on the rise. The male body was celebrated through advertising campaigns for brands such as Calvin Klein, particularly by photographers Bruce Weber and Herb Ritts. Male bodies and men&#x27;s undergarments were commodified and packaged for mass consumption, and swimwear and sportswear were influenced by sports photography and fitness. Over time, swimwear evolved from weighty wool to high-tech skin-tight garments, eventually cross-breeding with sportswear, underwear and exercise wear, resulting in the interchangeable fashions of the 1990s.

== Men&#x27;s bikini ==

The term &quot;men&#x27;s bikini&quot; is sometimes used to describe swim briefs. Men&#x27;s bikinis can have high or low side panels, and string sides or tie sides. Most lack a button or flap front. Unlike swim briefs, bikinis are not designed for drag reduction and generally lack a visible waistband. Suits less than 1.5 inches wide at the hips are less common for sporting purposes and are most often worn for recreation, fashion, and sun tanning. The posing brief standard to bodybuilding competitions is an example of this style. Male punk rock musicians have performed on stage wearing bikini briefs. The 2000 Bollywood film &quot;Hera Pheri&quot; shows men sunbathing in bikinis, who were mistakenly believed to be women from a distance.

Male bikini tops also exist and are often used as visual gags. A &quot;mankini&quot; is a type of sling swimsuit worn by men. The term is inspired by the word bikini. It was popularized by English comedian Sacha Baron Cohen when he donned one for comic effect in the film &quot;Borat&quot;.
== Bikini waxing ==


Bikini waxing is the epilation of pubic hair beyond the bikini line by use of waxing. The bikini line delineates the part of a woman&#x27;s pubic area to be covered by the bottom part of a bikini, which means any pubic hair visible beyond the boundaries of a swimsuit. Visible pubic hair is widely culturally disapproved, considered to be embarrassing, and often removed.

As popularity of bikinis grew, the acceptability of pubic hair diminished. But, with certain styles of women&#x27;s swimwear, pubic hair may become visible around the crotch area of a swimsuit. With the reduction in the size of swimsuits, especially since the advent of the bikini after 1945, the practice of bikini waxing has also become popular. The Brazilian style which became popular with the rise of thong bottoms.

Depending on the style of bikini-bottom and the amount of skin visible outside the bikini, pubic hair may be styled into several styles: American waxing (removal of pubic hair from the sides, top of the thighs, and under the navel), French waxing (leaving only a vertical strip in front), or Brazilian waxing (removal of all hair in the pelvic area, particularly suitable for thong bottoms).

== Bikini tan ==

The tan lines created by the wearing of a bikini while tanning are known as a bikini tan. These tan lines separate pale breasts, crotch, and buttocks from otherwise tanned skin. Prominent bikini tan lines were popular in the 1990s, and a spa in Brazil started offering perfect bikini tan lines using masking tapes in 2016.

As bikini-style swimsuits leave most of the body exposed to potentially dangerous UV radiation, overexposure can cause sunburn, skin cancer, as well as other acute and chronic health effects on the skin, eyes, and immune system. As a result, medical organizations recommend that bikini wearers protect themselves from UV radiation by using broad-spectrum sunscreen, which has been shown to protect against sunburn, skin cancer, wrinkling and sagging skin.

A 1969 innovation of tan-through swimwear uses fabric which is perforated with thousands of micro holes that are nearly invisible to the naked eye, but which let enough sunlight through to produce a line-free tan.

<doc id="4551" wikidata="Q797848" url="?curid=4551" title="Babur">
<text>Babur (; 14 February 148326 December 1530; born Zahīr ud-Dīn Muhammad) was the founder of the Mughal Empire in the Indian subcontinent. He was a descendant of Timur and Genghis Khan through his father and mother respectively. He was also given the posthumous name of &quot;Firdaws Makani&quot; (&#x27;Dwelling in Paradise&#x27;).

Born in Andijan in the Fergana Valley (now in Uzbekistan), Babur was the eldest son of Umar Shaikh Mirza II (1456–1494, governor of Fergana from 1469 to 1494) and a great-great-great-grandson of Timur (1336–1405). Babur ascended the throne of Fergana in its capital Akhsikath in 1494 at the age of twelve and faced rebellion. He conquered Samarkand two years later, only to lose Fergana soon after. In his attempt to reconquer Fergana, he lost control of Samarkand. In 1501, his attempt to recapture both the regions failed when the Uzbek prince Muhammad Shaybani defeated him and founded the Khanate of Bukhara.

In 1504, he conquered Kabul, which was under the putative rule of Abdur Razaq Mirza, the infant heir of Ulugh Beg II. Babur formed a partnership with the Safavid emperor Ismail I and reconquered parts of Turkestan, including Samarkand, only to again lose it and the other newly conquered lands to the Shaybanids.

After losing Samarkand for the third time, Babur turned his attention to India and employed aid from the neighbouring Safavid and Ottoman empires. He defeated Ibrahim Lodi, the Sultan of Delhi, at the First Battle of Panipat in 1526 and founded the Mughal Empire. Before the defeat of Lodi at Delhi, the Sultanate of Delhi had been a spent force, long in a state of decline.

The rival adjacent Kingdom of Mewar under the rule of Rana Sanga had become one of the most powerful states in North India. Sanga unified several Rajput clans for the first time after Prithviraj Chauhan and advanced on Babur with a grand coalition of 80,000-100,000 Rajputs, engaging Babur in the Battle of Khanwa. Babur arrived at Khanwa with 40,000-50,000 soldiers. Nonetheless, Sanga suffered a major defeat due to Babur&#x27;s skillful troop positioning and use of gunpowder, specifically matchlocks and small cannons.

The Battle of Khanwa was one of the most decisive battles in Indian history, more so than the First Battle of Panipat, as the defeat of Rana Sanga was a watershed event in the Mughal conquest of North India.

Religiously, Babur started his life as a staunch Sunni Muslim, but he underwent significant evolution. Babur became more tolerant as he conquered new territories and grew older, allowing other religions to peacefully coexist in his empire and at his court. He also displayed a certain attraction to theology, poetry, geography, history, and biology—disciplines he promoted at his court—earning him a frequent association with representatives of the Timurid Renaissance. His religious and philosophical stances are characterized as humanistic.

Babur married several times. Notable among his children are Humayun, Kamran Mirza, Hindal Mirza, Masuma Sultan Begum, and the author Gulbadan Begum.

Babur died in 1530 in Agra and Humayun succeeded him. Babur was first buried in Agra but, as per his wishes, his remains were moved to Kabul and reburied. He ranks as a national hero in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. Many of his poems have become popular folk songs. He wrote the &quot;Baburnama&quot; in Chaghatai Turkic; it was translated into Persian during the reign (1556–1605) of his grandson, the emperor Akbar.

== Name ==
&quot;Ẓahīr-ud-Dīn&quot; is Arabic for &quot;Defender of the Faith&quot; (of Islam), and &quot;Muhammad&quot; honours the Islamic prophet. The name was chosen for Babur by the Sufi saint Khwaja Ahrar, who was the spiritual master of his father. The difficulty of pronouncing the name for his Central Asian Turco-Mongol army may have been responsible for the greater popularity of his nickname Babur, also variously spelled Baber, Babar, and Bābor. The name is generally taken in reference to the Persian word &quot;babur&quot; (), meaning &quot;tiger&quot; or &quot;panther&quot;. The word repeatedly appears in Ferdowsi&#x27;s &quot;Shahnameh&quot; and was borrowed into the Turkic languages of Central Asia.

== Background ==
Babur&#x27;s memoirs form the main source for details of his life. They are known as the &quot;Baburnama&quot; and were written in Chagatai, his first language, though, according to Dale, &quot;his Turkic prose is highly Persianized in its sentence structure, morphology or word formation and vocabulary.&quot; &quot;Baburnama&quot; was translated into Persian during the rule of Babur&#x27;s grandson Akbar.

Babur was born on 14 February 1483 in the city of Andijan, Fergana Valley, contemporary Uzbekistan. He was the eldest son of Umar Shaikh Mirza II, ruler of the Fergana Valley, the son of Abū Saʿīd Mirza (and grandson of Miran Shah, who was himself son of Timur) and his wife Qutlugh Nigar Khanum, daughter of Yunus Khan, the ruler of Moghulistan (a descendant of Genghis Khan).

Babur hailed from the Turkic Barlas tribe, which was of Mongol origin and had embraced the Turco-Persian tradition They had also converted to Islam centuries earlier and resided in Turkestan and Khorasan.

Aside from the Chaghatai Turkic, Babur was equally fluent in Classical Persian, the lingua franca of the Timurid elite.

Some of Babur&#x27;s relatives, such as his uncles Mahmud Khan (Moghul Khan) and Ahmad Khan, continued to identify as Mongols, and allowed him to use their Mongol troops to help recover his fortunes in the turbulent years that followed.

Hence, Babur, though nominally a Mongol (or &quot;Moghul&quot; in Persian language), drew much of his support from the local Turkic and Iranian people of Central Asia, and his army was diverse in its ethnic makeup. It included Sarts, Tajiks, ethnic Afghans, Arabs, as well as Barlas and Chaghatayid Turko-Mongols from Central Asia.

== Ruler of Central Asia ==

=== As ruler of Fergana ===
In 1494, eleven-year-old Babur became the ruler of Fergana, in present-day Uzbekistan, after Umar Sheikh Mirza died &quot;while tending pigeons in an ill-constructed dovecote that toppled into the ravine below the palace&quot;. During this time, two of his uncles from the neighbouring kingdoms, who were hostile to his father, and a group of nobles who wanted his younger brother Jahangir to be the ruler, threatened his succession to the throne. His uncles were relentless in their attempts to dislodge him from this position as well as from many of his other territorial possessions to come. Babur was able to secure his throne mainly because of help from his maternal grandmother, Aisan Daulat Begum, although there was also some luck involved.

Most territories around his kingdom were ruled by his relatives, who were descendants of either Timur or Genghis Khan, and were constantly in conflict. At that time, rival princes were fighting over the city of Samarkand to the west, which was ruled by his paternal cousin. Babur had a great ambition to capture the city. In 1497, he besieged Samarkand for seven months before eventually gaining control over it. He was fifteen years old and for him the campaign was a huge achievement. Babur was able to hold the city despite desertions in his army, but he later fell seriously ill. Meanwhile, a rebellion back home, approximately away, amongst nobles who favoured his brother, robbed him of Fergana. As he was marching to recover it, he lost Samarkand to a rival prince, leaving him with neither. He had held Samarkand for 100 days, and he considered this defeat as his biggest loss, obsessing over it even later in his life after his conquests in India.

For three years, Babur concentrated on building a strong army, recruiting widely amongst the Tajiks of Badakhshan in particular. In 1500–1501, he again laid siege to Samarkand, and indeed he took the city briefly, but he was in turn besieged by his most formidable rival, Muhammad Shaybani, Khan of the Uzbeks. The situation became such that Babar was compelled to give his sister, Khanzada, to Shaybani in marriage as part of the peace settlement. Only after this were Babur and his troops allowed to depart the city in safety. Samarkand, his lifelong obsession, was thus lost again. He then tried to reclaim Fergana, but lost the battle there also and, escaping with a small band of followers, he wandered the mountains of central Asia and took refuge with hill tribes. By 1502, he had resigned all hopes of recovering Fergana; he was left with nothing and was forced to try his luck elsewhere. He finally went to Tashkent, which was ruled by his maternal uncle, but he found himself less than welcome there. Babur wrote, &quot;During my stay in Tashkent, I endured much poverty and humiliation. No country, or hope of one!&quot; Thus, during the ten years since becoming the ruler of Fergana, Babur suffered many short-lived victories and was without shelter and in exile, aided by friends and peasants.

=== At Kabul ===

Kabul was ruled by Babur&#x27;s paternal uncle Ulugh Beg II, who died leaving only an infant as heir. The city was then claimed by Mukin Begh, who was considered to be a usurper and was opposed by the local populace. In 1504, Babur was able to cross the snowy Hindu Kush mountains and capture Kabul from the remaining Arghunids, who were forced to retreat to Kandahar. With this move, he gained a new kingdom, re-established his fortunes and would remain its ruler until 1526. In 1505, because of the low revenue generated by his new mountain kingdom, Babur began his first expedition to India; in his memoirs, he wrote, &quot;My desire for Hindustan had been constant. It was in the month of Shaban, the Sun being in Aquarius, that we rode out of Kabul for Hindustan&quot;. It was a brief raid across the Khyber Pass.

In the same year, Babur united with Sultan Husayn Mirza Bayqarah of Herat, a fellow Timurid and distant relative, against their common enemy, the Uzbek Shaybani. However, this venture did not take place because Husayn Mirza died in 1506 and his two sons were reluctant to go to war. Babur instead stayed at Herat after being invited by the two Mirza brothers. It was then the cultural capital of the eastern Muslim world. Though he was disgusted by the vices and luxuries of the city, he marvelled at the intellectual abundance there, which he stated was &quot;filled with learned and matched men&quot;. He became acquainted with the work of the Chagatai poet Mir Ali Shir Nava&#x27;i, who encouraged the use of Chagatai as a literary language. Nava&#x27;i&#x27;s proficiency with the language, which he is credited with founding, may have influenced Babur in his decision to use it for his memoirs. He spent two months there before being forced to leave because of diminishing resources; it later was overrun by Shaybani and the Mirzas fled.
Babur became the only reigning ruler of the Timurid dynasty after the loss of Herat, and many princes sought refuge with him at Kabul because of Shaybani&#x27;s invasion in the west. He thus assumed the title of &quot;Padshah&quot; (emperor) among the Timurids—though this title was insignificant since most of his ancestral lands were taken, Kabul itself was in danger and Shaybani continued to be a threat. Babur prevailed during a potential rebellion in Kabul, but two years later a revolt among some of his leading generals drove him out of Kabul. Escaping with very few companions, Babur soon returned to the city, capturing Kabul again and regaining the allegiance of the rebels. Meanwhile, Shaybani was defeated and killed by Ismail I, Shah of Shia Safavid Persia, in 1510.

Babur and the remaining Timurids used this opportunity to reconquer their ancestral territories. Over the following few years, Babur and Shah Ismail formed a partnership in an attempt to take over parts of Central Asia. In return for Ismail&#x27;s assistance, Babur permitted the Safavids to act as a suzerain over him and his followers. Thus, in 1513, after leaving his brother Nasir Mirza to rule Kabul, he managed to take Samarkand for the third time; he also took Bokhara but lost both again to the Uzbeks. Shah Ismail reunited Babur with his sister Khānzāda, who had been imprisoned by and forced to marry the recently deceased Shaybani. Babur returned to Kabul after three years in 1514. The following 11 years of his rule mainly involved dealing with relatively insignificant rebellions from Afghan tribes, his nobles and relatives, in addition to conducting raids across the eastern mountains. Babur began to modernise and train his army despite it being, for him, relatively peaceful times.

== Foreign relations ==
Determined to conquer the Uzbeks and recapture his ancestral homeland, Babur was wary of their allies the Ottomans, and made no attempt to establish formal diplomatic relations with them. He did, however, employ the matchlock commander Mustafa Rumi and several other Ottomans. From them, he adopted the tactic of using matchlocks and cannons in the field (rather than only in sieges), which gave him an important advantage in India.

== Formation of the Mughal Empire ==

Babur still wanted to escape from the Uzbeks, and he chose India as a refuge instead of Badakhshan, which was to the north of Kabul. He wrote, &quot;In the presence of such power and potency, we had to think of some place for ourselves and, at this crisis and in the crack of time there was, put a wider space between us and the strong foeman.&quot; After his third loss of Samarkand, Babur gave full attention to the conquest of North India, launching a campaign; he reached the Chenab River, now in Pakistan, in 1519. Until 1524, his aim was to only expand his rule to Punjab, mainly to fulfill the legacy of his ancestor Timur, since it used to be part of his empire. At the time parts of North India were part of the Delhi Sultanate, ruled by Ibrahim Lodi of the Lodi dynasty, but the sultanate was crumbling and there were many defectors. Babur received invitations from Daulat Khan Lodi, Governor of Punjab and Ala-ud-Din, uncle of Ibrahim. He sent an ambassador to Ibrahim, claiming himself the rightful heir to the throne, but the ambassador was detained at Lahore, Punjab, and released months later.
Babur started for Lahore in 1524 but found that Daulat Khan Lodi had been driven out by forces sent by Ibrahim Lodi. When Babur arrived at Lahore, the Lodi army marched out and his army was routed. In response, Babur burned Lahore for two days, then marched to Dibalpur, placing Alam Khan, another rebel uncle of Lodi, as governor. Alam Khan was quickly overthrown and fled to Kabul. In response, Babur supplied Alam Khan with troops who later joined up with Daulat Khan Lodi, and together with about 30,000 troops, they besieged Ibrahim Lodi at Delhi. The sultan easily defeated and drove off Alam&#x27;s army, and Babur realised that he would not allow him to occupy the Punjab.

=== First Battle of Panipat ===

In November 1525 Babur got news at Peshawar that Daulat Khan Lodi had switched sides, and Babur drove out Ala-ud-Din. Babur then marched onto Lahore to confront Daulat Khan Lodi, only to see Daulat&#x27;s army melt away at their approach. Daulat surrendered and was pardoned. Thus within three weeks of crossing the Indus River Babur had become the master of Punjab.

Babur marched on to Delhi via Sirhind. He reached Panipat on 20 April 1526 and there met Ibrahim Lodi&#x27;s numerically superior army of about 100,000 soldiers and 100 elephants. In the battle that began on the following day, Babur used the tactic of &quot;Tulugma&quot;, encircling Ibrahim Lodi&#x27;s army and forcing it to face artillery fire directly, as well as frightening its war elephants. Ibrahim Lodi died during the battle, thus ending the Lodi dynasty.

Babur wrote in his memoirs about his victory:

After the battle, Babur occupied Delhi and Agra, took the throne of Lodi, and laid the foundation for the eventual rise of Mughal rule in India. However, before he became North India&#x27;s ruler, he had to fend off challengers, such as Rana Sanga.

Many of Babur&#x27;s men allegedly wanted to leave India due to its warm climate, but Babur motivated them to stay and expand his empire.

=== Battle of Khanwa ===

The Battle of Khanwa was fought between Babur and the Rajput ruler of Mewar, Rana Sanga on 16 March 1527. Rana Sanga wanted to overthrow Babur, whom he considered to be a foreigner ruling in India, and also to extend the Rajput territories by annexing Delhi and Agra. He was supported by Afghan chiefs who felt Babur had been deceptive by refusing to fulfil promises made to them. Upon receiving news of Rana Sangha&#x27;s advance towards Agra, Babur took a defensive position at Khanwa (currently in the Indian state of Rajasthan), from where he hoped to launch a counterattack later. According to K.V. Krishna Rao, Babur won the battle because of his &quot;superior generalship&quot; and modern tactics; the battle was one of the first in India that featured cannons and muskets. Rao also notes that Rana Sanga faced &quot;treachery&quot; when the Hindu chief Silhadi joined Babur&#x27;s army with a garrison of 6,000 soldiers.

Babur recognised Sanga&#x27;s skill in leadership, calling him one of the two greatest non-Muslim Indian kings of the time, the other being Krishnadevaraya of Vijayanagara.

=== Battle of Chanderi ===
The Battle of Chanderi took place the year after the Battle of Khanwa. On receiving news that Rana Sanga had made preparations to renew the conflict with him, Babur decided to isolate the Rana by defeating one of his staunchest allies, Medini Rai, who was the ruler of Malwa.

Upon reaching Chanderi, on 20 January 1528, Babur offered Shamsabad to Medini Rao in exchange for Chanderi as a peace overture, but the offer was rejected. The outer fortress of Chanderi was taken by Babur&#x27;s army at night, and the next morning the upper fort was captured. Babur himself expressed surprise that the upper fort had fallen within an hour of the final assault. Seeing no hope of victory, Medini Rai organized a &quot;jauhar&quot;, during which women and children within the fortress immolated themselves. A small number of soldiers also collected in Medini Rao&#x27;s house and killed each other in collective suicide. This sacrifice does not seem to have impressed Babur, who did not express a word of admiration for the enemy in his autobiography.

==Religious policy==
Babur defeated and killed Ibrahim Lodi, the last Sultan of the Lodi dynasty, in 1526. Babur ruled for 4 years and was succeeded by his son Humayun whose reign was temporarily usurped by the Suri dynasty. During their 30-year rule, religious violence continued in India. Records of the violence and trauma, from Sikh-Muslim perspective, include those recorded in Sikh literature of the 16th century. The violence of Babur in the 1520s was witnessed by Guru Nanak, who commented upon it in four hymns. Historians suggest the early Mughal period of religious violence contributed to introspection and then the transformation in Sikhism from pacifism to militancy for self-defense. According to Babur&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Baburnama&quot;, his campaign in northwest India targeted Hindus and Sikhs as well as apostates (non-Sunni sects of Islam), and an immense number were killed, with Muslim camps building &quot;towers of skulls of the infidels&quot; on hillocks. In Babur&#x27;s secret will, in the year 935AH, 1529 AD, to Humayun, Babur adivses Humayun to administer justice according to the ways of every religion, avoid sacrifice of the cow, not to ruin the temples and shrines of any law obeying community, overlook the dissensions of the Shias and the Sunnis.

== Personal life and relationships ==
There are no descriptions about Babur&#x27;s physical appearance, except from the paintings in the translation of the &quot;Baburnama&quot; prepared during the reign of Akbar. In his autobiography, Babur claimed to be strong and physically fit, and that he had swum across every major river he encountered, including twice across the Ganges River in North India.

Babur did not initially know Old Hindi; however, his Turkic poetry indicates that he picked up some of its vocabulary later in life.

Unlike his father, he had ascetic tendencies and did not have any great interest in women. In his first marriage, he was &quot;bashful&quot; towards Aisha Sultan Begum, later losing his affection for her. Babur showed similar shyness in his interactions with Baburi, a boy in his camp with whom he had an infatuation around this time, recounting that: 
However, Babur acquired several more wives and concubines over the years, and as required for a prince, he was able to ensure the continuity of his line.
Babur&#x27;s first wife, Aisha Sultan Begum, was his paternal cousin, the daughter of Sultan Ahmad Mirza, his father&#x27;s brother. She was an infant when betrothed to Babur, who was himself five years old. They married eleven years later, . The couple had one daughter, Fakhr-un-Nissa, who died within a year in 1500. Three years later, after Babur&#x27;s first defeat at Fergana, Aisha left him and returned to her father&#x27;s household. In 1504, Babur married Zaynab Sultan Begum, who died childless within two years. In the period 1506–08, Babur married four women, Maham Begum (in 1506), Masuma Sultan Begum, Gulrukh Begum and Dildar Begum. Babur had four children by Maham Begum, of whom only one survived infancy. This was his eldest son and heir, Humayun. Masuma Sultan Begum died during childbirth; the year of her death is disputed (either 1508 or 1519). Gulrukh bore Babur two sons, Kamran and Askari, and Dildar Begum was the mother of Babur&#x27;s youngest son, Hindal. Babur later married Mubaraka Yusufzai, a Pashtun woman of the Yusufzai tribe. Gulnar Aghacha and Nargul Aghacha were two Circassian slaves given to Babur as gifts by Tahmasp Shah Safavi, the Shah of Persia. They became &quot;recognized ladies of the royal household.&quot;

During his rule in Kabul, when there was a time of relative peace, Babur pursued his interests in literature, art, music and gardening. Previously, he never drank alcohol and avoided it when he was in Herat. In Kabul, he first tasted it at the age of thirty. He then began to drink regularly, host wine parties and consume preparations made from opium. Though religion had a central place in his life, Babur also approvingly quoted a line of poetry by one of his contemporaries: &quot;I am drunk, officer. Punish me when I am sober&quot;. He quit drinking for health reasons before the Battle of Khanwa, just two years before his death, and demanded that his court do the same. But he did not stop chewing narcotic preparations, and did not lose his sense of irony. He wrote, &quot;Everyone regrets drinking and swears an oath (of abstinence); I swore the oath and regret that.&quot;

Babur was opposed to the blind obedience towards the Chinggisid laws and customs that were influential in Turco-Mongol society:&quot;Previously our ancestors had shown unusual respect for the Chingizid code (). They did not violate this code sitting and rising at councils and court, at feasts and dinners. [However] Chingez Khan&#x27;s code is not a &quot;nass qati&quot; (categorical text) that a person must follow. Whenever one leaves a good custom, it should be followed. If ancestors leave a bad custom, however it is necessary to substitute a good one.&quot;Making clear that to him, the categorical text (i.e. the Quran) had displaced Genghis Khan&#x27;s &quot;Yassa&quot; in moral and legal matters.

== Poetry ==

Babur was an acclaimed writer, who had a profound love for literature. His library was one of his most beloved possessions that he always carried around with him, and books were one of the treasures he searched for in new conquered lands. In his memoirs, when he listed sovereigns and nobles of a conquered land, he also mentioned poets, musicians and other educated people.

During his 47-year life, Babur left a rich literary and scientific heritage. He authored his famous memoir the Bāburnāma, as well as beautiful lyrical works or &quot;ghazals&quot;, treatises on Muslim jurisprudence (Mubayyin), poetics (Aruz risolasi), music, and a special calligraphy, known as &quot;khatt-i Baburi&quot;.

Babur&#x27;s Bāburnāma is a collection of memoirs, written in the Chagatai language and later translated into Persian, the usual literary language of the Mughal court, during the rule of emperor Akbar. However, Babur&#x27;s Turkic prose in Bāburnāma is already highly Persianized in its sentence structure, vocabulary, and morphology, and also consists of several phrases and minor poems in Persian.

Babur wrote most of his poems in Chagatai Turkic, known to him as &quot;Türki&quot;, but he also composed in Persian. However, he was mostly praised for his literary works written in Turkic, which drew comparison with the poetry of Ali-Shir Nava&#x27;i.

The following ruba&#x27;i is an example of Babur&#x27;s poetry written in Turkic, composed in the aftermath of his famous victory in North India to celebrate his ghazi status.
&lt;poem&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
I am become a desert wanderer for Islam,
Having joined battle with infidels and Hindus
I readied myself to become a martyr,
God be thanked I am become a ghazi.&lt;/poem&gt;
== Family ==
=== Consorts ===
*Aisha Sultan Begum ( 1499; 1503), daughter of Sultan Ahmed Mirza — First wife of Babur
*Zainab Sultan Begum ( 1504; 1506–07), daughter of Sultan Mahmud Mirza
*Maham Begum ( 1506) — Babur&#x27;s chief and favourite consort
*Masuma Sultan Begum ( 1507; 1508), daughter of Sultan Ahmed Mirza and half-sister of Aisha Sultan Begum
*Bibi Mubarika ( 1519), Pashtun of the Yusufzai tribe
*Gulrukh Begum (not to be confused with Babur&#x27;s daughter Gulrukh Begum, who was also known as Gulbarg Begum)
*Dildar Begum
*Gulnar Aghacha, Circassian concubine
*Nargul Aghacha, Circassian concubine

The identity of the mother of one of Babur&#x27;s daughters, Gulrukh Begum is disputed. Gulrukh&#x27;s mother may have been the daughter of Sultan Mahmud Mirza by his wife Pasha Begum who is referred to as Saliha Sultan Begum in certain secondary sources, however this name is not mentioned in the Baburnama or the works of Gulbadan Begum, which casts doubt on her existence. This woman may never have existed at all or she may even be the same woman as Dildar Begum.

=== Issue ===
The sons of Babur were:
*Humayun ( 1508; 1556) — with Maham Begum — succeeded Babur as the second Mughal Emperor
*Kamran Mirza ( 1512; 1557) — with Gulrukh Begum
*Askari Mirza ( 1518; 1557) — with Gulrukh Begum
*Hindal Mirza ( 1519; 1551) — with Dildar Begum
*Ahmad Mirza ( young) — with Gulrukh Begum

== Death and legacy ==
Babur died in Agra at the age of 47 on and was succeeded by his eldest son, Humayun. He was first buried in Chauburji, Agra. Later as per his wishes, his mortal remains were moved to Kabul and reburied in Bagh-e Babur in Kabul sometime between 1539 and 1544.

It is generally agreed that, as a Timurid, Babur was not only significantly influenced by the Persian culture, but also that his empire gave rise to the expansion of the Persianate ethos in the Indian subcontinent. He emerged in his own telling as a Timurid Renaissance inheritor, leaving signs of Islamic, artistic literary, and social aspects in India.

For example, F. Lehmann states in the &quot;Encyclopædia Iranica&quot;:
Although all applications of modern Central Asian ethnicities to people of Babur&#x27;s time are anachronistic, Soviet and Uzbek sources regard Babur as an ethnic Uzbek. At the same time, during the Soviet Union Uzbek scholars were censored for idealising and praising Babur and other historical figures such as Ali-Shir Nava&#x27;i.

Babur is considered a national hero in Uzbekistan. On 14 February 2008, stamps in his name were issued in the country to commemorate his 525th birth anniversary. Many of Babur&#x27;s poems have become popular Uzbek folk songs, especially by Sherali Joʻrayev. Some sources claim that Babur is a national hero in Kyrgyzstan too. In October 2005, Pakistan developed the Babur Cruise Missile, named in his honour.

&quot;Shahenshah Babar&quot;, an Indian film about the emperor directed by Wajahat Mirza was released in 1944. The 1960 Indian biographical film &quot;Babar&quot; by Hemen Gupta covered the emperor&#x27;s life with Gajanan Jagirdar in the lead role.

One of the enduring features of Babur&#x27;s life was that he left behind the lively and well-written autobiography known as &quot;Baburnama&quot;. Quoting Henry Beveridge, Stanley Lane-Poole writes:
In his own words, &quot;The cream of my testimony is this, do nothing against your brothers even though they may deserve it.&quot; Also, &quot;The new year, the spring, the wine and the beloved are joyful. Babur make merry, for the world will not be there for you a second time.&quot;

=== Babri Masjid ===
The Babri Masjid (&quot;Babur&#x27;s Mosque&quot;) in Ayodhya, was constructed by Mir Baqi (commander of the Babur), according to the mosque&#x27;s inscriptions, in 1528–29 (935 AH). On 6 December 1992, Babri Masjid was demolished by a large group of activists of the Vishva Hindu Parishad and allied organisations.

In 2003 the Allahabad High Court ordered the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to conduct a more in-depth study and an excavation to ascertain the type of structure beneath the mosque. The excavation was conducted from 12 March 2003 to 7 August 2003, resulting in 1360 discoveries.

The summary of the ASI report indicated the presence of a 10th-century temple under the mosque. The ASI team said that, human activity at the site dates back to the 13th century BCE. The next few layers date back to the Shunga period (second-first century BCE) and the Kushan period. During the early medieval period (11–12th century CE), a huge but short-lived structure of nearly 50 metres north–south orientation was constructed. On the remains of this structure, another massive structure was constructed: this structure had at least three structural phases and three successive floors attached with it. The report concluded that it was over the top of this construction that the disputed structure was constructed during the early 16th century. Archaeologist KK Muhammed, the only Muslim member in the team of people surveying the excavation, also confirmed individually that there existed a temple like structure before the Babri Masjid was constructed over it.

Several archaeologists disputed ASI findings. According to archaeologist Supriya Verma and Jaya Menon, who observed the excavations on behalf of the Sunni Waqf Board, &quot;the ASI was operating with a preconceived notion of discovering the remains of a temple beneath the demolished mosque, even selectively altering the evidence to suit its hypothesis.&quot; this allegation particularly focused on the &quot;pillar bases&quot; central to the claim of a temple, which Verma and Menon alleged were irregularly shaped, irregularly spaced and largely the result of selective excavation, rather than representing genuine evidence of pillars.

The Supreme Court judgement of 2019 granted the entire disputed land to the Hindus for construction of a temple, stating that Hindus continue to worship at the site and continued to hold the land outside the yard. It also held that there is nothing to prove that the structure, which was present before the construction of the mosque, was demolished for the purpose of building mosque or was already in ruins.

<text>Bernard of Clairvaux, O.Cist. (; 109020 August 1153), venerated as Saint Bernard, was an abbot, mystic, co-founder of the Knights Templar, and a major leader in the reform of the Benedictines through the nascent Cistercian Order.

He was sent to found Clairvaux Abbey only a few years after becoming a monk at Cîteaux. In the year 1128, Bernard attended the Council of Troyes, at which he traced the outlines of the Rule of the Knights Templar, which soon became an ideal of Christian nobility.

On the death of Pope Honorius II in 1130, a schism arose in the church. Bernard was a major proponent of Pope Innocent II, arguing effectively for his legitimacy over the Antipope Anacletus II.

The eloquent abbot advocated crusades in general and convinced many to participate in the unsuccessful Second Crusade, notably through a famous sermon at Vézelay (1146).

Bernard was canonized just 21 years after his death by Pope Alexander III. In 1830 Pope Pius VIII declared him a Doctor of the Church.

==Early life (1090–1113)==
Bernard&#x27;s parents were Tescelin de Fontaine, lord of Fontaine-lès-Dijon, and Alèthe de Montbard, both members of the highest nobility of Burgundy. Bernard was the third of seven children, six of whom were sons. Aged nine, he was sent to a school at Châtillon-sur-Seine run by the secular canons of Saint-Vorles. Bernard had an interest in literature and rhetoric. 

Bernard&#x27;s mother died when he was a youth. During his education with priests, he often thought of becoming one. In 1098, a group led by Robert of Molesme had founded Cîteaux Abbey, near Dijon, with the purpose of living according to a literal interpretation of the Rule of St. Benedict. They established new administrative structures among their monasteries, effectively creating a new order, known, after the first abbey, as the Order of Cistercians. After his mother died, Bernard decided to go to Cîteaux. In 1113 he and thirty other young noblemen of Burgundy, many of whom were his relatives, sought and gained admission to the new monastery. Bernard&#x27;s example was so convincing that scores (among them his own father) followed him into the monastic life. As a result, he is considered the patron of religious vocations.

==Abbot of Clairvaux==
The little community of reformed Benedictines at Cîteaux grew rapidly. Three years after entering, Bernard was sent with a group of twelve monks to found a new house at Vallée d&#x27;Absinthe, in the Diocese of Langres. This Bernard named &quot;Claire Vallée&quot;, or &quot;Clairvaux&quot;, on 25 June 1115, and the names of Bernard and Clairvaux soon became inseparable. Bernard was made abbot by William of Champeaux, Bishop of Châlons-sur-Marne. From then on a strong friendship grew between the abbot and the bishop, who was professor of theology at Notre Dame of Paris and the founder of St. Victor Abbey in Paris.

The beginnings of Clairvaux Abbey were austere and Bernard even more so. He had often been ill since his noviciate, due to extreme fasting. Nonetheless, candidates for the monastic life flocked to him in great numbers. Clairvaux soon started founding new communities. In 1118 Trois-Fontaines Abbey was founded in the diocese of Châlons; in 1119 Fontenay Abbey in the Diocese of Autun; and in 1121 Foigny Abbey near Vervins. In Bernard&#x27;s lifetime, more than sixty abbeys followed, though some were not new foundations but transferals to the Cistercians. 

Bernard spent extended time outside of the abbey as a preacher and a diplomat in the service of the pope. Described by Jean-Baptiste Chautard as &quot;the most contemplative and yet at the same time the most active man of his age,&quot; Bernard described the disparate parts of his personality when he called himself the &quot;chimera of his age.&quot;

In addition to successes, Bernard also had his trials. Once, when he was absent from Clairvaux, the prior of the rival Abbey of Cluny went to Clairvaux and convinced Bernard&#x27;s cousin, Robert of Châtillon, to become a Benedictine. This was the occasion of the longest and most emotional of Bernard&#x27;s letters. When his brother Gerard died, Bernard was devastated, and his deep mourning was the inspiration for one of his most moving sermons.
The Cluny Benedictines were unhappy to see Cîteaux gain such prominence so quickly, particularly since many Benedictines were becoming Cistercians. They criticized the Cistercian way of life. At the solicitation of William of St.-Thierry, Bernard defended the Cistercians with his &quot;Apology&quot;. Peter the Venerable, abbot of Cluny, answered Bernard and assured him of his admiration and friendship. In the meantime, Cluny launched a reform and Bernard befriended Abbot Suger.
==Doctor of the Church==

Although acknowledged as &quot;a difficult saint,&quot; Bernard has remained influential in the centuries since his death and was named a Doctor of the Church in 1830. In 1953, on the 800th anniversary of his death, Pope Pius XII devoted the encyclical &quot;Doctor Mellifluus&quot; to him. He labeled the abbot &quot;the last of the Fathers.&quot; 

In opposition to the rational approach to understanding God used by the scholastics, Bernard preached in a poetic manner, using appeals to affect and conversion to nurture a more immediate faith experience. He is considered to be a master of Christian rhetoric: &quot;His use of language remains perhaps his most universal legacy.&quot; He contributed lyrics to the Cistercian Hymnal.

As a mariologist, Bernard insisted on Mary&#x27;s central role in Christian theology and preached effectively on Marian devotions. He developed the theology of her role as Co-Redemptrix and mediator. 

As a master of prayer, the abbot emphasized the value of personal, experiential friendship with Christ. 

===Schism===
Bernard made a self-confident impression and had an undeniable charisma in the eyes of his contemporaries; &quot;his first and greatest miracle,&quot; wrote the historian Holdsworth, &quot;was himself.&quot; He defended the rights of the church against the encroachments of kings and princes, and recalled to their duty Henri Sanglier, archbishop of Sens and Stephen of Senlis, bishop of Paris. When Honorius II died in 1130, a schism broke out in the Church by the election of two popes, Pope Innocent II and Antipope Anacletus II. Innocent, having been banished from Rome by Anacletus, took refuge in France. King Louis VI convened a national council of the French bishops at Étampes and Bernard, summoned there by the bishops, was chosen to judge between the rival popes. He decided in favour of Innocent.

Bernard travelled on to Italy and reconciled Pisa with Genoa, and Milan with the pope. The same year Bernard was again at the Council of Reims at the side of Innocent II. He then went to Aquitaine where he succeeded for the time in detaching William X, Duke of Aquitaine, from the cause of Anacletus.
Germany had decided to support Innocent through Norbert of Xanten, who was a friend of Bernard&#x27;s. Pope Innocent, however, insisted on Bernard&#x27;s company when he met with Lothair II, Holy Roman Emperor. Lothair II became Innocent&#x27;s strongest ally among the nobility. Although the councils of Étampes, Würzburg, Clermont, and Rheims all supported Innocent, large portions of the Christian world still supported Anacletus.

In a letter by Bernard to German Emperor Lothair regarding Antipope Anacletus, Bernard wrote, &quot;It is a disgrace for Christ that a Jew sits on the throne of St. Peter&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Anacletus has not even a good reputation with his friends, while Innocent is illustrious beyond all doubt.&quot; (One of Anacletus&#x27; great-great-grandparents, Benedictus, maybe Baruch in Hebrew, was a Jew who had converted to Christianity - but Anacletus himself was not a Jew, and his family had been Christians for three generations).

Bernard wrote to Gerard of Angoulême (a letter known as Letter 126), which questioned Gerard&#x27;s reasons for supporting Anacletus. Bernard later commented that Gerard was his most formidable opponent during the whole schism. After persuading Gerard, Bernard travelled to visit William X, Duke of Aquitaine. He was the hardest for Bernard to convince. He did not pledge allegiance to Innocent until 1135. After that, Bernard spent most of his time in Italy persuading the Italians to pledge allegiance to Innocent.

In 1132, Bernard accompanied Innocent II into Italy, and at Cluny, the pope abolished the dues which Clairvaux used to pay to that abbey. This action gave rise to a quarrel between the White Monks and the Black Monks which lasted 20 years. In May of that year, the pope, supported by the army of Lothair III, entered Rome, but Lothair III, feeling himself too weak to resist the partisans of Anacletus, retired beyond the Alps, and Innocent sought refuge in Pisa in September 1133. Bernard had returned to France in June and was continuing the work of peacemaking which he had commenced in 1130.

Towards the end of 1134, he made a second journey into Aquitaine, where William X had relapsed into schism. Bernard invited William to the Mass which he celebrated in the Church of La Couldre. At the Eucharist, he &quot;admonished the Duke not to despise God as he did His servants&quot;. William yielded and the schism ended.

Bernard went again to Italy, where Roger II of Sicily was endeavouring to withdraw the Pisans from their allegiance to Innocent. He recalled the city of Milan to obedience to the pope as they had followed the deposed Anselm V, Archbishop of Milan. For this, he was offered, and he refused, the see of Milan. He then returned to Clairvaux. Believing himself at last secure in his cloister, Bernard devoted himself to the composition of the works which won him the title of &quot;Doctor of the Church&quot;. He wrote at this time his sermons on the Song of Songs.

In 1137, he was again forced to leave the abbey by order of the pope to put an end to the quarrel between Lothair and Roger of Sicily. At the conference held at Palermo, Bernard succeeded in convincing Roger of the rights of Innocent II. He also silenced the final supporters who sustained the schism. Anacletus died of &quot;grief and disappointment&quot; in 1138, and with him, the schism ended.

In 1139, Bernard assisted at the Second Council of the Lateran, in which the surviving adherents of the schism were definitively condemned. About the same time, Bernard was visited at Clairvaux by Malachy, Primate of All Ireland, and a very close friendship formed between them. Malachy wanted to become a Cistercian, but the pope would not give his permission. Malachy died at Clairvaux in 1148.

===Conflict with Abelard===
Towards the close of the 11th century, a spirit of independence flourished within schools of philosophy and theology. The movement found an ardent and powerful advocate in Peter Abelard. Abelard&#x27;s treatise on the Trinity had been condemned as heretical in 1121, and he was compelled to throw his own book into a fire. However, Abelard continued to develop his controversial teachings. Bernard is said to have held a meeting with Abelard intending to persuade him to amend his writings, during which Abelard repented and promised to do so. But once out of Bernard&#x27;s presence, he reneged.

Bernard then denounced Abelard to the pope and cardinals of the Curia. Abelard sought a debate with Bernard, but Bernard initially declined, saying he did not feel matters of such importance should be settled by logical analyses. Bernard&#x27;s letters to William of St-Thierry also express his apprehension about confronting the preeminent logician. Abelard continued to press for a public debate, and made his challenge widely known, making it hard for Bernard to decline. In 1141, at the urgings of Abelard, the archbishop of Sens called a council of bishops, where Abelard and Bernard were to put their respective cases so Abelard would have a chance to clear his name.

Bernard lobbied the prelates on the evening before the debate, swaying many of them to his view. The next day, after Bernard made his opening statement, Abelard decided to retire without attempting to answer. The council found in favour of Bernard and their judgment was confirmed by the pope. Abelard submitted without resistance, and he retired to Cluny to live under the protection of Peter the Venerable, where he died two years later.

===The challenge of heresy===
Bernard had occupied himself in sending bands of monks from his overcrowded monastery into Germany, Sweden, England, Ireland, Portugal, Switzerland, and Italy. Some of these, at the command of Innocent II, took possession of Tre Fontane Abbey, from which Eugene III was chosen in 1145. Pope Innocent II died in the year 1143. His two successors, Pope Celestine II and Pope Lucius II, reigned only a short time, and then Bernard saw one of his disciples, Bernard of Pisa, known thereafter as Eugene III, raised to the Chair of Saint Peter. Bernard sent him, at the pope&#x27;s own request, various instructions which comprise the often-quoted &quot;De consideratione.&quot; Its main argument is that church reform ought to start with the pope. Temporal matters are merely accessories; Bernard insists that piety and meditation were to precede action.

Having previously helped end the schism within the Church, Bernard was now called upon to combat heresy. Henry of Lausanne, a former Cluniac monk, had adopted the teachings of the Petrobrusians, followers of Peter of Bruys and spread them in a modified form after Peter&#x27;s death. Henry of Lausanne&#x27;s followers became known as Henricians. In June 1145, at the invitation of Cardinal Alberic of Ostia, Bernard travelled in southern France. His preaching, aided by his ascetic looks and simple attire, helped doom the new sects. Both the Henrician and the Petrobrusian faiths began to die out by the end of that year. Soon afterwards, Henry of Lausanne was arrested, brought before the bishop of Toulouse, and probably imprisoned for life. In a letter to the people of Toulouse, undoubtedly written at the end of 1146, Bernard calls upon them to extirpate the last remnants of the heresy. He also preached against Catharism. Prior to the second hearing of Gilbert of Poitiers at the Council of Reims 1148, Bernard held a private meeting with a number of the attendees, attempting to pressure them to condemn Gilbert. This offended the various cardinals in attendance, who then proceeded to insist that they were the only persons who could judge the case, and no verdict of heresy was placed against Gilbert.

== Monastic and clerical preaching ==
As abbot, Bernard often addressed his community, but he also spoke to other monastics and, in one particularly famous case, to students of Theology in Paris. He gave the sermon &quot;Ad clericos de conversione&quot; (to clerics on conversion) in 1139 or early 1140, to a group of scholars and student clerics. His many sermons on the Song of Songs belong to the often-studied sermons he addressed to the monks at Clairvaux.

== Crusade preaching ==

===Second Crusade (1146–1149)===

News came at this time from the Holy Land that alarmed Christendom. Christians had been defeated at the Siege of Edessa and most of the county had fallen into the hands of the Seljuk Turks. The Kingdom of Jerusalem and the other Crusader states were threatened with similar disaster. Deputations of the bishops of Armenia solicited aid from the pope, and the King of France also sent ambassadors. In 1144 Eugene III commissioned Bernard to preach the Second Crusade and granted the same indulgences for it which Pope Urban II had accorded to the First Crusade.

There was at first virtually no popular enthusiasm for the crusade as there had been in 1095. Bernard found it expedient to dwell upon taking the cross as a potent means of gaining absolution for sin and attaining grace. On 31 March, with King Louis VII of France present, he preached to an enormous crowd in a field at Vézelay, making &quot;the speech of his life&quot;. When he had finished, many of his listeners enlisted; they supposedly ran out of the cloth used to make crosses for the new recruits.

Unlike the First Crusade, the new venture attracted royalty, such as the French queen Eleanor of Aquitaine and scores of high aristocrats and bishops. But an even greater show of support came from the common people. Bernard wrote Pope Eugene a few days afterwards, &quot;Cities and castles are now empty. There is not left one man to seven women, and everywhere there are widows to still-living husbands.&quot;

Bernard then passed into Germany, with reported miracles contributing to the success of his mission. King Conrad III of Germany and his nephew Frederick Barbarossa, received the cross from the hand of Bernard. Pope Eugenius came in person to France to encourage the enterprise. As in the First Crusade, the preaching led to attacks on Jews; a fanatical French monk named Radulf was apparently inspiring massacres of Jews in the Rhineland, Cologne, Mainz, Worms, and Speyer, with Radulf claiming Jews were not contributing financially to the rescue of the Holy Land. The archbishop of Cologne and the archbishop of Mainz were vehemently opposed to these attacks and asked Bernard to denounce them. This he did, but when the campaign continued, Bernard travelled from Flanders to Germany to deal with the problems in person. He then found Radulf in Mainz and was able to silence him, returning him to his monastery.

The last years of Bernard&#x27;s life were saddened by the failure of the Second Crusade he had preached, and the entire responsibility which was thrown upon him. Bernard sent an apology to the Pope and it is inserted in the second part of his &quot;&quot;Book of Considerations&quot;.&quot; There he explains how the sins of the crusaders were the cause of their misfortune and failures.

=== Wendish Crusade (1147) ===
Bernard did not actually preach the Wendish Crusade, but he did write a letter that advocated subduing this group of Western Slavs so that they should not be an obstacle to the Second Crusade. He was for battling them &quot;until such a time as, by God&#x27;s help, they shall either be converted or deleted&quot;. A decree issued in Frankfurt stated that the letter should be proclaimed widely and read aloud, so that &quot;the letter functioned as a sermon.&quot;

==Final years (1149–1153)==

The death of his contemporaries served as a warning to Bernard of his own approaching end. The first to die was Suger in 1152, of whom Bernard wrote to Eugene III, &quot;If there is any precious vase adorning the palace of the King of Kings it is the soul of the venerable Suger.&quot; Conrad III and his son Henry died the same year. Bernard died at age sixty-three on 20 August 1153, after forty years of monastic life. He was buried at Clairvaux Abbey. After its destruction in 1792 by the French Revolutionary government his remains were transferred to Troyes Cathedral.

==Legacy==
Bernard&#x27;s theology and Mariology continue to be of major importance. Bernard helped found 163 monasteries in different parts of Europe. Cistercians honour him as one of the greatest early Cistercians. His feast day is 20 August.

Bernard is Dante Alighieri&#x27;s last guide, in &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, as he travels through the Empyrean.

John Calvin and Martin Luther quoted Bernard several times in support of the doctrine of &quot;Sola Fide.&quot; Calvin also quotes him in setting forth his doctrine of forensic alien righteousness, or as it is commonly called imputed righteousness. Bernard introduced a major shift, a &quot;fundamental reorientation&quot; into medieval theology.

The Couvent et Basilique Saint-Bernard, a collection of buildings dating from the 12th, 17th, and 19th centuries, is dedicated to Bernard and stands in his birthplace of Fontaine-lès-Dijon. Countless churches and chapels have St. Bernard as their patron saint.

==Works==

The modern critical edition is &quot;&quot; (1957–1977), edited by Jean Leclercq.

Bernard&#x27;s works include:
* Written in the defence of the Cistercians against the claims of the monks of Cluny.
* .
* 
* Addressed to Pope Eugene III.
* &quot;De moribus et officio episcoporum&quot; (in Latin). A letter to Henri Sanglier, Archbishop of Sens on the duties of bishops.

His sermons are also numerous:

* Most famous are his &quot;&quot; (&quot;Sermons on the Song of Songs&quot;). They may have found their origins in sermons preached to the monks of Clairvaux, but theories differ. These sermons contain an autobiographical passage, sermon 26, mourning the death of his brother, Gerard. After Bernard died, the English Cistercian Gilbert of Hoyland continued Bernard&#x27;s incomplete series of 86 sermons on the biblical Song of Songs.
* There are 125 surviving &quot;&quot; (&quot;Sermons on the Liturgical Year&quot;).
* There are also &quot;&quot; (&quot;Sermons on Different Topics&quot;).
* 547 letters survive.

===Misattributions===
Numerous letters, treatises, and other works were falsely attributed to him. These include:
* This was probably written at some point in the thirteenth century. It circulated extensively in the Middle Ages under Bernard&#x27;s name and was one of the most popular religious works of the later Middle Ages. Its theme is self-knowledge as the beginning of wisdom; it begins with the phrase &quot;Many know much, but do not know themselves&quot;.
* The hymn &quot;Jesu dulcis memoria&quot;.
* &quot;L’enfer est plein de bonnes volontés ou désirs&quot; hell is full of good intentions and wills]&quot;.&quot; Francis de Sales, in a letter to Madame de Chantal in 1604&quot;.&quot; No works have been found with this proverb.

<text>Bishkek, formerly known as Frunze, and earlier Pishpek, is the capital and largest city of Kyrgyzstan. Bishkek is also the administrative centre of the Chüy Region. Bishkek is situated near the border with Kazakhstan and has a population of 1,074,075, as of 2021.

The Khanate of Kokand established the fortress of Pishpek in 1825 to control local caravan routes and to collect tribute from Kyrgyz tribes. On 4 September 1860, with the approval of the Kyrgyz, Russian forces led by Colonel Apollon Zimmermann destroyed the fortress. In the present day, the fortress ruins can be found just north of Jibek jolu Street, near the new main mosque. A Russian settlement was established in 1868 on the site of the fortress under its original name, Pishpek. It lay within the General Governorship of Russian Turkestan and its Semirechye Oblast.

The Kara-Kirghiz Autonomous Oblast was established in 1925 in Russian Turkestan, promoting Pishpek to its capital. In 1926, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union renamed the city &quot;Frunze&quot;, after Bolshevik military leader Mikhail Frunze (1885–1925), who was born there. Frunze became the capital of the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic in 1936, during the final stages of national delimitation in the Soviet Union. In 1991, the Kyrgyz parliament changed the capital&#x27;s name to Bishkek.

Bishkek is situated at an altitude of about , just off the northern fringe of the Kyrgyz Ala-Too Range, an extension of the Tian Shan mountain range. These mountains rise to a height of . North of the city, a fertile and gently undulating steppe extends far north into neighboring Kazakhstan. The river Chüy drains most of the area. Bishkek is connected to the Turkestan–Siberia Railway by a spur line.

Bishkek is a city of wide boulevards and marble-faced public buildings combined with numerous Soviet-style apartment blocks surrounding interior courtyards. There are also thousands of smaller, privately built houses, mostly outside the city centre. Streets follow a grid pattern, with most flanked on both sides by narrow irrigation channels, which provide water to trees which provide shade during the hot summers.

== Etymology ==
Bishkek is supposedly named after the paddle used to churn fermenting milk.

The official website of the Bishkek&#x27;s city hall provides the following etymological justification for the name of the city: the pregnant wife of a hero lost a paddle used to churn kumis. While looking for it, she suddenly gave birth to a boy, who she named Bishkek. Bishkek would grow up to be a noble figure and after his death, was buried on a mound near the banks of the Alamüdün. There, a tombstone was erected. The building was seen and described by travelers of the 17th and 18th centuries.

==History==
Based on DNA evidence, the area near Bishkek is considered one of the possible origins of the Black Death between AD 1346 and 1353.

===Kokhand rule===
Originally a caravan rest stop, possibly founded by the Sogdians, on one of the branches of the Silk Road through the Tian Shan range, the location was fortified in 1825 by the khan of Kokand with a mud fort. In the last years of Kokhand rule, the Pishpek fortress was led by Atabek, the Datka. In 1844, the forces of Ormon Khan, the leader of the , briefly captured the fortress.

===Tsarist era===
In 1860, Imperial Russia annexed the area, and the military forces of Colonel Apollon Zimmerman took and razed the fort. Colonel Zimmermann rebuilt the town over the destroyed fort and appointed field-Poruchik Titov as head of a new Russian garrison. The Imperial Russian government redeveloped the site from 1877 onward, encouraging the settlement of Russian peasants by giving them fertile land to develop.

===Soviet era===

In 1926, the city became the capital of the newly established Kirghiz ASSR and was renamed Frunze after Mikhail Frunze, Lenin&#x27;s close associate who was born in Bishkek and played key roles during the revolutions of 1905 and 1917 and during the Russian Civil War of the early 1920s.

===Independence era===
The early 1990s were a tumultuous time for Bishkek. In June 1990, a state of emergency was declared following severe ethnic riots in southern Kyrgyzstan that threatened to spread to the capital. The city was renamed Bishkek on 5 February 1991, and Kyrgyzstan achieved independence later that year during the breakup of the Soviet Union. Before independence, the majority of Bishkek&#x27;s population were ethnic Russians. In 2004, Russians made up approximately 20% of the city&#x27;s population, and about in 2011.

Bishkek is Kyrgyzstan&#x27;s financial centre, with all of the country&#x27;s 21 commercial banks headquartered there. During the Soviet era, the city was home to many industrial plants, but most have been shut down since 1991 or now operate on a much-reduced scale. One of Bishkek&#x27;s largest employment centres today is the Dordoy Bazaar open market, where many of the Chinese goods imported to CIS countries are sold.

==Geography==
===Orientation===
Although Bishkek itself is relatively young, its surrounding area has some sites of interest dating to prehistoric times. There are also sites from the Greco-Buddhist period, the period of Nestorian influence, the era of the Central Asian &quot;khanates&quot;, and the Soviet period.

The central part of the city is laid out on a rectangular grid plan. The city&#x27;s main street is the east-west Chüy Avenue (Chüy Prospekti), named after the region&#x27;s main river. In the Soviet era, it was called Lenin Avenue. Along or near it are many important government buildings and universities. These include the Academy of Sciences compound. The westernmost section of the avenue is known as Deng Xiaoping Avenue.

The main north–south street is Yusup Abdrakhmanov Street, still commonly referred to by its old name, Sovietskaya Street. Its northern and southern sections are called, respectively, Yelebesov and Baityk Batyr Streets. Several major shopping centres are located along with it, and in the north, it provides access to Dordoy Bazaar.

Erkindik (&quot;Freedom&quot;) Boulevard runs from north to south, from the main railroad station (Bishkek II) south of Chüy Avenue to the museum quarter and sculpture park just north of Chüy Avenue, and further north toward the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In the past, it was called Dzerzhinsky Boulevard, named after a Communist revolutionary, Felix Dzerzhinsky, and its northern continuation is still called Dzerzhinsky Street.

An important east–west street is Jibek Jolu (&#x27;Silk Road&#x27;). It runs parallel to Chüy Avenue about north of it and is part of the main east–west road of Chüy Region. Both the eastern and western bus terminals are located along Jibek Jolu.

There is a Roman Catholic church located at ul. Vasiljeva 197 (near Rynok Bayat). It is the only Catholic cathedral in Kyrgyzstan.

A stadium named in honour of Dolon Omurzakov is located near the centre of Bishkek. This is the largest stadium in the Kyrgyz Republic.

===City centre===
* Kyrgyz State Historical Museum, located in Ala-Too Square, the main city square.
* State Museum of Applied Arts, containing examples of traditional Kyrgyz handicrafts.
* Frunze House Museum.
* Statue of Ivan Panfilov in the park near the White House.
* An equestrian statue of Mikhail Frunze stands in a large park (Boulevard Erkindik) across from the train station.
* The train station was built in 1946 by German prisoners of war and has survived since then without further renovation or repairs; most of those who built it perished and were buried in unmarked pits near the station.
* The main government building, the White House, is a large seven-story marble building and the former headquarters of the Communist Party of the Kirghiz SSR.
* At Ala-Too Square there is an independence monument where the changing of the guards may be watched.
*Osh Bazaar, west of the city centre, is a large, picturesque produce market.
*Kyrgyz National Philharmonic, concert hall.

===Outer neighbourhoods===
The Dordoy Bazaar, just inside the bypass highway on the north-eastern edge of the city, is a major retail and wholesale market.

===Outside the city===
The Kyrgyz Ala-Too mountain range, some away, provides a spectacular backdrop to the city; the Ala Archa National Park is only a 30 to 45 minutes drive away.

===Distances===
Bishkek is about 300 km away directly from the country&#x27;s second largest city Osh. However, its nearest large city is Almaty of Kazakhstan, which is 190 km to the east. Furthermore, it is 470 km from Tashkent (Uzbekistan), 680 km from Dushanbe (Tajikistan), and about 1,000 km each from Astana (Kazakhstan), Ürümqi (China), Islamabad (Pakistan), and Kabul (Afghanistan).

===Climate===
Bishkek has a Mediterranean-influenced humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dsa&quot;), as the average mean temperature in the winter is below . Average precipitation is around per year. Average daily high temperatures range from in January to about during July. The summer months are dominated by dry periods, punctuated by the occasional thunderstorm, which produces strong gusty winds and rare dust storms. The mountains to the south provide a natural boundary and protection from damaging weather, as does the smaller mountain chain that runs north-west to south-east. In the winter months, sparse snow storms and frequent heavy fog are the dominating features. There are sometimes temperature inversions, during which the fog can last for days at a time.

==Demographics==
Bishkek is the most populated city in Kyrgyzstan. Its population, estimated in 2021, was 1,074,075. From the foundation of the city to the mid-1990s, ethnic Russians and other peoples of European descent (Ukrainians, Germans) comprised the majority of the city&#x27;s population. According to the 1970 census, the ethnic Kyrgyz were only 12.3%, while Europeans comprised more than 80% of the Frunze population. Now Bishkek is a predominantly Kyrgyz city, with 75% of its residents Kyrgyz, while European peoples make up around 15% of the population. Despite this fact, Russian is the main language while Kyrgyz continues losing ground, especially among the younger generations.

==Ecology and environment==

===Air quality===
Emissions of air pollutants in Bishkek amounted to 14,400 tons in 2010. Among all cities in Kyrgyzstan, the level of air pollution in Bishkek is the highest, occasionally exceeding maximum allowable concentrations by several times, especially in the city centre. For example, concentrations of formaldehyde occasionally exceed maximum allowable limits by a factor of four. The hydrogeologist Zheenbek Kulbekov identifies coal-heating mainly in informal settlements (&quot;samozakhvat&quot;), the exhaust from private vehicles and the lack of air circulation as the three main factors for the grave air pollution in Kyrgyzstan&#x27;s capital. The latter is mainly due to the haphazard construction of private multi-story buildings - in contradiction to former city plans developed up until the end of the USSR - which prompted discussion on a moratorium on the further construction of high-rise buildings.

Responsibility for ambient air quality monitoring in Bishkek lies with the Kyrgyz State Agency of Hydrometeorology. There are seven air-quality monitoring stations in Bishkek, measuring levels of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, formaldehyde, and ammonia.

==Economy==

Bishkek uses the Kyrgyzstan currency, the som. The som&#x27;s value fluctuates regularly but averaged around 86 som per U.S. dollar as of November 2024. The economy in Bishkek is primarily agricultural, and agricultural products are sometimes bartered in the outlying regions. The streets of Bishkek are regularly lined with produce vendors in a market-style venue. In most of the downtown area there is a more urban cityscape with banks, stores, markets, and malls. Sought-after goods include hand-crafted artisan pieces, such as statues, carvings, paintings, and many nature-based sculptures.

=== Housing ===
As with many cities in post-Soviet states, housing in Bishkek has undergone extensive changes since the collapse of the Soviet Union. While housing was formerly distributed to citizens in the Soviet era, housing in Bishkek has since become privatised.

Though single-family houses are slowly becoming more popular, the majority of the residents live in Soviet-era apartments. Despite the Kyrgyz economy experiencing growth, increases in available housing have been slow with very little new construction and a doubling of prices from 2001 to 2002. This changed by the 2010s when an unprecedented housing boom has transformed the city. By 2021, over 246 construction firms were active in Kyrgyzstan, primarily focusing on upscale residences, often marketed as &#x27;business class&#x27; or &#x27;premium class&#x27; accommodations. The southern part of the city, where a significant portion of new constructions is concentrated, faces a critical concern due to its proximity to the Issyk-Ata fault line. Compounded by the inadequately seismic-proof architecture of most of these buildings, this situation poses a serious threat to the safety of residents and has sparked criticism. Limited land availability propels private developers to encroach into socialist-era residential zones, resulting in the loss of green spaces and vital social infrastructure, including sports fields and playgrounds.

Those unable to afford the high housing price within Bishkek, notably internal migrants from rural villages and small provincial towns, often have to resort to informal squatter settlements on the city&#x27;s outskirts such as Ak Jar, Ak Jol, Ak Örgö, Altyn Kazyk, Archa Beshik, Kalys-Ordo, Kayndy-2, Kelechek, Muras-Ordo and TETS-2 Yntymak. These urban settlements are estimated to house 400,000 people or about 30 percent of Bishkek&#x27;s population. While many of the settlements have lacked basic necessities such as electricity and running water, recently, the local government has pushed to provide these services.

==Government==
Local government is administered by the Bishkek Mayor&#x27;s Office. Askarbek Salymbekov was mayor until his resignation in August 2005, after which his deputy, Arstanbek Nogoev, took over the mayorship. Nogoev was in turn removed from his position in October 2007 through a decree of President Kurmanbek Bakiyev and replaced by businessman and former first deputy prime minister Daniar Usenov. In July 2008 former head of the Kyrgyz Railways Nariman Tuleyev was appointed mayor, who was dismissed by the interim government after 7 April 2010. From April 2010 to February 2011 Isa Omurkulov, also a former head of the Kyrgyz Railways, was an interim mayor, and from 4 February 2011 to 14 December 2013 he was re-elected the mayor of Bishkek. Kubanychbek Kulmatov was nominated for election by parliamentary group of Social Democratic Party of Kyrgyzstan in city kenesh, and he was elected as a new mayor on 15 January 2014, and stepped down on 9 February 2016. The next mayor, Albek Sabirbekovich Ibraimov, was also nominated for election by parliamentary group of Social Democratic Party of Kyrgyzstan in city kenesh, and Bishkek City Kenesh elected him on 27 February 2016. The current mayor is Emil Abdykadyrov, who was elected on 24 February 2022.

===Administrative divisions===
Bishkek city covers and is administered separately and not part of any region. Besides the city proper, one urban-type settlement and one village are administered by the city: Chong-Aryk and Orto-Say. The city is divided into 4 districts: Birinchi May, Lenin, Oktyabr and Sverdlov. Chong-Aryk and Orto-Say are part of Lenin District. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, there has been discussion of replacing the Soviet era district names with ones that reflect Kyrgyz identity and history. Other former Soviet republics have widely replaced Soviet era place names; despite renaming the capital in 1991, Kyrgyzstan is the only nation in Central Asia to retain Soviet era names for districts in its capital.

== Culture ==
Bishkek is culturally the country&#x27;s most important city. It is home to the National Library of the Kyrgyz Republic as well as a number of museums, e.g. the Kyrgyz State Historical Museum or the M. V. Frunze Museum. The national public broadcasting service KTRK or Kyrgyz Television is based in Bishkek. Newspapers in Bishkek include the English-language Bishkek Observer, the world&#x27;s only dungan-language newspaper called Huimin bao and the Russian-language Vecherniy Bishkek newspaper.

===Religion===
The largest religion is Sunni Islam, but since many Russians live in Kyrgyzstan, there is also a large Russian Orthodox community. The Bishkek Central Mosque is one of the largest in Central Asia. Bishkek is home to the Roman Catholic Apostolic Administration of Kyrgyzstan.

===Sports===
Bishkek is home to Dolen Omurzakov Stadium, the largest football stadium in Kyrgyzstan and the only one eligible to host international matches. Several Bishkek-based football teams play on this pitch, including six-time Kyrgyzstan League champions, Dordoi Bishkek. Others include Alga Bishkek, Ilbirs Bishkek, and RUOR-Guardia Bishkek.

Bishkek hosted the 2014 IIHF Challenge Cup of Asia – Division I.

==Education==
Educational institutions in Bishkek include:
* APAP KR
* American University of Central Asia
* Arabaev Kyrgyz State University
* Bishkek Humanities University
* International Atatürk-Alatoo University
* International University of Kyrgyzstan
* Kyrgyz International University NRZ

==Transportation==


===Mass public transport===
Public transportation includes buses, electric trolleybuses, and public vans (known in Russian as &quot;marshrutka&quot;). The first bus and trolley bus services in Bishkek were introduced in 1934 and 1951, respectively.

Taxi cabs can be found throughout the city.

The city is considering designing and building a light rail system.

===Commuter and long-distance buses===
There are two main bus stations in Bishkek. The smaller old Eastern Bus Station is primarily the terminal for minibusses to various destinations within or just beyond the eastern suburbs, such as Kant, Tokmok, Kemin, Issyk Ata, or the Korday border crossing.

Long-distance regular bus and minibus services to all parts of the country, as well as to Almaty (the largest city in neighbouring Kazakhstan) and Kashgar, China, run mostly from the newer grand Western Bus Station; only a smaller number run from the Eastern Station.

The Dordoy Bazaar on the north-eastern outskirts of the city also contains makeshift terminals for frequent minibusses to suburban towns in all directions (from Sokuluk in the west to Tokmak in the east) and to some buses taking traders to Kazakhstan and Siberia.

===Rail===
, the Bishkek-2 railway station sees only a few trains a day. It offers a popular three-day train service from Bishkek to Moscow.

There are also long-distance trains that leave for Siberia (Novosibirsk and Novokuznetsk), via Almaty, over the TurkSib route, and to Yekaterinburg (Sverdlovsk) in the Urals, via Astana. These services are remarkably slow (over 48 hours to Yekaterinburg), due to long stops at the border and the indirect route (the trains first have to go west for more than a before they enter the main TurkSib line and can continue to the east or north). For example, as of the fall of 2008, train No. 305 Bishkek-Yekaterinburg was scheduled to take 11 hours to reach the Shu junction—a distance of some by rail, and less than half of that by road.

===Air===
The city is served by Manas International Airport (IATA code FRU), located approximately north-west of the city centre.

In 2001, the United States obtained the right to use Manas International Airport as an air base for its military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Russia subsequently (2003) established an airbase of its own (Kant Air Base) near Kant, some east of Bishkek. It is based at a facility that used to be home to a major Soviet military pilot training school; one of its students, Hosni Mubarak, later became president of Egypt.

<doc id="4560" wikidata="Q162729" url="?curid=4560" title="Braveheart">
<text>Braveheart is a 1995 American epic historical drama film directed and produced by Mel Gibson, who portrays Scottish warrior William Wallace in the First War of Scottish Independence against King Edward I of England. The film also stars Sophie Marceau, Patrick McGoohan, Catherine McCormack and Angus Macfadyen. The story is inspired by Blind Harry&#x27;s 15th century epic poem &quot;The Actes and Deidis of the Illustre and Vallyeant Campioun Schir William Wallace&quot; and was adapted for the screen by Randall Wallace.

Development on the film initially started at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) when producer Alan Ladd Jr. picked up the project from Wallace, but when MGM was going through new management, Ladd left the studio and took the project with him. Despite initially declining, Gibson eventually decided to direct the film, and to star as Wallace. &quot;Braveheart&quot; was filmed in Scotland and Ireland from June to October 1994. The film, which was produced by Gibson&#x27;s Icon Productions and The Ladd Company, was distributed by Paramount Pictures in the United States and Canada and by 20th Century Fox internationally.

Released on May 24, 1995, &quot;Braveheart&quot; received generally positive reviews, with praise for its action scenes and score, and was a critical and commercial success, though it was criticized for its historical inaccuracies. The film also garnered numerous awards. A legacy sequel, &quot;Robert the Bruce&quot;, was released in 2019.

==Plot==
In 1280, Edward I of England, known as &quot;Longshanks&quot;, conquers Scotland following the death of the Scots&#x27; king, who left no heir. Young William Wallace witnesses the aftermath of Longshanks&#x27; execution of several Scottish nobles, then loses his father and brother when they resist the English. He leaves home to be raised by his uncle, Argyle.

Years later, Longshanks grants his noblemen land and privileges in Scotland, including &quot;jus primae noctis&quot;, while his son marries French princess Isabelle. Meanwhile, a grown Wallace returns home and secretly marries his childhood friend Murron MacClannough. Soon after, Wallace rescues Murron from a soldier, but Murron is subsequently captured and executed. In retribution, Wallace and the locals overthrow the garrison, beginning a rebellion that soon spreads. Longshanks orders his son to stop Wallace while he campaigns in France. Wallace defeats an army sent by the prince at Stirling, then invades England by sacking York. He also meets Robert the Bruce, a contender for the Scottish crown.

After returning to England, Longshanks sends Isabelle to negotiate with Wallace as a distraction from the movement of Longshanks&#x27; forces. Meeting Wallace, Isabelle becomes enamored with him and warns him of Longshanks&#x27; plans. Wallace faces Longshanks at Falkirk. During the battle, nobles Mornay and Lochlan withdraw, having been bribed by Longshanks, resulting in Wallace&#x27;s army being overwhelmed. Wallace also discovers Robert the Bruce had joined Longshanks. After helping Wallace escape, Robert vows to not be on the wrong side again. Wallace kills Mornay and Lochlan for their betrayal and foils an assassination plot with Isabelle&#x27;s help. Wallace and Isabelle spend the following night together, while Longshanks&#x27; health declines. At a meeting in Edinburgh, Wallace is captured. Realizing his father&#x27;s responsibility, Robert disowns him. In England, Wallace is condemned to execution. After a final meeting with Wallace, Isabelle tells Longshanks, who can no longer speak, that his bloodline will end upon his death as she is pregnant with Wallace&#x27;s child and will ensure that Longshanks&#x27; son spends as short a time as possible as monarch. At his execution, Wallace refuses to submit, even while being disemboweled. The magistrate encourages Wallace to seek mercy and be granted a quick death. Wallace instead shouts, &quot;Freedom!&quot;, while Longshanks dies. Before being beheaded, Wallace sees a vision of Murron in the crowd.

In 1314, Robert, now Scotland&#x27;s king, faces the English at Bannockburn, and implores his men to fight with him as they did with Wallace. After Wallace&#x27;s sword is thrown to land point-down in the ground, Robert leads the Scots to a final victory.

== Cast ==

== Production ==
=== Development ===
Producer Alan Ladd Jr. initially had the project at MGM-Pathé Communications when he picked up the script from Randall Wallace. When Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) was going through new management in 1993, Ladd left the studio and took some of its top properties, including &quot;Braveheart&quot;. Mel Gibson came across the script and even though he liked it, he initially passed on it. However, the thought of it kept coming back to him, and he ultimately decided to take on the project. Terry Gilliam was offered to direct the film, but he declined. Gibson was initially interested in directing only and considered Brad Pitt in the role of Sir William Wallace, but later reluctantly agreed to play Wallace as well. He also considered Jason Patric for the role. Sean Connery was approached to play King Edward, but he declined due to other commitments. Gibson said that Connery&#x27;s pronunciation of &quot;Goulash&quot; helped him for the Scottish accent for the film.

Gibson and his production company, Icon Productions, had difficulty raising enough money for the film. Warner Bros. was willing to fund the project on the condition that Gibson sign for another &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; sequel, which he refused. Gibson eventually gained enough financing for the film, with Paramount Pictures financing a third of the budget in exchange for North American distribution rights to the film, and 20th Century Fox putting up the other two-thirds in exchange for international distribution rights.

=== Filming ===

Filming was initially due to take place fully in the United Kingdom, but most of the shoot was moved to Ireland at late notice after lobbying from the Irish government and their offer to supply 1,600 members of the Irish Army Reserve as extras. Shooting was planned to take 12 weeks on location in Ireland and at Ardmore Studios plus five weeks on location in Scotland. Principal photography on the film began on June 6, 1994. To lower costs, Gibson had the same extras portray both armies. The reservists had been given permission to grow beards and swapped their military uniforms for medieval garb. Principal photography ended on October 28, 1994. The film was shot in the anamorphic format with Panavision C- and E-Series lenses. Gibson also later said that while filming a battle scene a horse nearly &quot;killed him&quot; but his stunt double was able to save him as the horse fell.

Gibson had to tone down the film&#x27;s battle scenes to avoid an NC-17 rating from the MPAA; the final version was rated R for &quot;brutal medieval warfare&quot;. Gibson and editor Steven Rosenblum initially had a film at 195 minutes, but Sherry Lansing, who was the head of Paramount at the time, requested Gibson and Rosenblum to cut the film down to 177 minutes. According to Gibson in a 2016 interview with &quot;Collider&quot;, there is a four-hour version of the film, and he expressed interest in reassembling it if both Paramount and Fox were interested.

== Soundtrack ==

The score was composed and conducted by James Horner and performed by the London Symphony Orchestra. It is Horner&#x27;s second of three collaborations with Mel Gibson as director. The score has gone on to be one of the most commercially successful soundtracks of all time. It received considerable acclaim from film critics and audiences and was nominated for a number of awards, including the Academy Award, Saturn Award, BAFTA Award, and Golden Globe Award.

== Release ==

&quot;Braveheart&quot; premiered at the Seattle International Film Festival on May 18, 1995, and received its wide release in U.S. cinemas six days later.

=== Home media ===
&quot;Braveheart&quot; was released on LaserDisc in both pan and scan and widescreen on March 12, 1996. That same day, it also was made available on VHS in pan and scan only and was re-issued in widescreen on August 27.

The film was released on DVD on August 29, 2000. This edition included the film only in widescreen, a commentary track by Gibson, a behind-the-scenes featurete, along the trailers.

It was released on Blu-ray as part of the &quot;Paramount Sapphire Series&quot; on September 1, 2009. It included the DVD features along with new bonus material. It was released on 4K UHD Blu-ray as part of the 4K upgrade of the &quot;Paramount Sapphire Series&quot; on May 15, 2018.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;Braveheart&quot; grossed $75.5million in the United States and Canada and $133.5million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $209.0million, against a budget of $53–$72million. It spent nine non-consecutive weeks in the Top 10 at the US box officeits first seven weeks, then two more weeks during its fifth month in theatres.

=== Critical response ===


Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the film, calling it &quot;one of the most spectacular entertainments in years.&quot; Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half out of four stars, calling it &quot;An action epic with the spirit of the Hollywood swordplay classics and the grungy ferocity of &quot;The Road Warrior&quot;.&quot; In a positive review, Gene Siskel wrote that &quot;in addition to staging battle scenes well, Gibson also manages to recreate the filth and mood of 700 years ago.&quot; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; felt that &quot;though the film dawdles a bit with the shimmery, dappled love stuff involving Wallace with a Scottish peasant and a French princess, the action will pin you to your seat.&quot; The depiction of the Battle of Stirling Bridge was listed by CNN as one of the best battles in cinema history.

Not all reviews were positive. Richard Schickel of &quot;Time&quot; magazine argued that &quot;everybody knows that a non-blubbering clause is standard in all movie stars&#x27; contracts. Too bad there isn&#x27;t one banning self-indulgence when they direct.&quot; Peter Stack of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; felt &quot;at times the film seems an obsessive ode to Mel Gibson machismo.&quot; In a 2005 poll by British film magazine &quot;Empire&quot;, &quot;Braveheart&quot; was No. 1 on their list of &quot;The Top 10 Worst Pictures to Win Best Picture Oscar&quot;. &quot;Empire&quot; readers had previously voted &quot;Braveheart&quot; the best film of 1995.

Alex von Tunzelmann of &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave the film a grade of C−, saying: &quot;Seemingly intended as a piece of anti-English propaganda, &quot;Braveheart&quot; offers an even greater insult to Scotland by making a total pig&#x27;s ear of its heritage. &quot;Historians from England will say I am a liar,&quot; intones the voiceover, &quot;but history is written by those who have hanged heroes.&quot; Well, that&#x27;s me told: but, regardless of whether you read English or Scottish historians on the matter, &quot;Braveheart&quot; still serves up a great big steaming haggis of lies..&quot;
In a 2012 article, Nathan Kamal called the film &quot;hugely overrated&quot;, criticizing the characters as one-dimensional.

=== Effect on tourism ===
The European premiere was on September 3, 1995, in Stirling.

In 1996, the year after the film was released, the annual three-day &quot;Braveheart Conference&quot; at Stirling Castle attracted fans of &quot;Braveheart&quot;, increasing the conference&#x27;s attendance to 167,000 from 66,000 in the previous year. In the following year, research on visitors to the Stirling area indicated that 55% of the visitors had seen &quot;Braveheart&quot;. Of visitors from outside Scotland, 15% of those who saw &quot;Braveheart&quot; said it influenced their decision to visit the country. Of all visitors who saw &quot;Braveheart&quot;, 39% said the film influenced in part their decision to visit Stirling, and 19% said the film was one of the main reasons for their visit. In the same year, a tourism report said that the &quot;&quot;Braveheart&quot; effect&quot; earned Scotland £7 million to £15 million in tourist revenue, and the report led to various national organizations encouraging international film productions to take place in Scotland.

The film generated huge interest in Scotland and in Scottish history, not only around the world, but also in Scotland itself. At a &quot;Braveheart&quot; Convention in 1997, held in Stirling the day after the Scottish Devolution vote and attended by 200 delegates from around the world, &quot;Braveheart&quot; author Randall Wallace, Seoras Wallace of the Wallace Clan, Scottish historian David Ross and Bláithín FitzGerald from Ireland gave lectures on various aspects of the film. Several of the actors also attended including James Robinson (Young William), Andrew Weir (Young Hamish), Julie Austin (the young bride) and Mhairi Calvey (Young Murron).

=== Awards and honors ===
&quot;Braveheart&quot; was nominated for many awards during the 1995 awards season, though it was not viewed by many as a major competitor to films such as &quot;Apollo 13&quot;, &quot;Il Postino: The Postman&quot;, &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot;, &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;, and &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;. It wasn&#x27;t until after the film won the Golden Globe Award for Best Director at the 53rd Golden Globe Awards that it was viewed as a serious Oscar contender.

When the nominations were announced for the 68th Academy Awards, &quot;Braveheart&quot; received ten Academy Award nominations, and a month later, won five including Best Picture, Best Director for Gibson, Best Cinematography, Best Sound Effects Editing, and Best Makeup. &quot;Braveheart&quot; became the ninth film to win Best Picture with no acting nominations and is one of only four films to win Best Picture without being nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture, the others being &quot;The Shape of Water&quot; in 2017, &quot;Green Book&quot; in 2018, and &quot;Nomadland&quot; in 2020.

The film also won the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay. In 2010, the Independent Film &amp; Television Alliance selected the film as one of the 30 Most Significant Independent Films of the last 30 years.

=== Cultural effects and accusations of Anglophobia ===
Lin Anderson, author of &quot;Braveheart: From Hollywood To Holyrood&quot;, credits the film with playing a significant role in affecting the Scottish political landscape in the mid- to late 1990s. Peter Jackson cited &quot;Braveheart&quot; as an influence in making the &quot;Lord of the Ring&quot;s film trilogy.

Sections of the English media accused the film of harbouring Anti-English sentiment. &quot;The Economist&quot; called it &quot;xenophobic&quot;, and John Sutherland writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated that: &quot;&quot;Braveheart&quot; gave full rein to a toxic Anglophobia&quot;. In &quot;The Times&quot;, Colin McArthur said &quot;the political effects are truly pernicious. It&#x27;s a xenophobic film.&quot; Ian Burrell of &quot;The Independent&quot; has said, &quot;The &quot;Braveheart&quot; phenomenon, a Hollywood-inspired rise in Scottish nationalism, has been linked to a rise in anti-English prejudice&quot;.

=== Wallace Monument ===

In 1997, a , sandstone statue depicting Mel Gibson as William Wallace in &quot;Braveheart&quot; was placed in the car park of the Wallace Monument near Stirling, Scotland. The statue, which was the work of Tom Church, a monumental mason from Brechin, included the word &#x27;Braveheart&#x27; on Wallace&#x27;s shield. The installation became the cause of much controversy; one local resident stated that it was wrong to &quot;desecrate the main memorial to Wallace with a lump of crap&quot;.

In 1998, someone wielding a hammer vandalized the statue&#x27;s face. After repairs were made, the statue was encased in a cage every night to prevent further vandalism. This only incited more calls for the statue to be removed, as it then appeared that the Gibson/Wallace figure was imprisoned. The statue was described as &quot;among the most loathed pieces of public art in Scotland&quot;. In 2008, the statue was returned to its sculptor to make room for a new visitor centre being built at the foot of the Wallace Monument.

== Historical inaccuracy ==
Randall Wallace, who wrote the screenplay, has acknowledged Blind Harry&#x27;s 15th-century epic poem &quot;The Acts and Deeds of Sir William Wallace, Knight of Elderslie&quot; as a major inspiration for the film. In defending his script, Randall Wallace has said, &quot;Is Blind Harry true? I don&#x27;t know. I know that it spoke to my heart and that&#x27;s what matters to me, that it spoke to my heart.&quot; Blind Harry&#x27;s poem is not regarded as historically accurate, and although some incidents in the film that are not historically accurate are taken from Blind Harry (e.g. the hanging of Scottish nobles at the start), there are large parts that are based neither on history nor Blind Harry (e.g. Wallace&#x27;s affair with Princess Isabella).

Elizabeth Ewan describes &quot;Braveheart&quot; as a film that &quot;almost totally sacrifices historical accuracy for epic adventure&quot;. It has been described as one of the most historically inaccurate modern films.
Sharon Krossa noted that the film contains numerous historical inaccuracies, beginning with the wearing of belted plaid (&quot;feileadh mór léine&quot;), which was not introduced until the 16th century, by Wallace and his men. In that period &quot;no Scots [...] wore belted plaids (let alone kilts of any kind).&quot; Moreover, when Highlanders finally did begin wearing the belted plaid, it was not &quot;in the rather bizarre style depicted in the film&quot;. She compares the inaccuracy to &quot;a film about Colonial America showing the colonial men wearing 20th-century business suits, but with the jackets worn back-to-front instead of the right way around.&quot; In a previous essay about the film, she wrote, &quot;The events aren&#x27;t accurate, the dates aren&#x27;t accurate, the characters aren&#x27;t accurate, the names aren&#x27;t accurate, the clothes aren&#x27;t accurate—in short, just about nothing is accurate.&quot; Peter Traquair has referred to Wallace&#x27;s &quot;farcical representation as a wild and hairy highlander painted with woad (1,000 years too late) running amok in a tartan kilt (500 years too early).&quot;
Caroline White of &quot;The Times &quot;described the film as being made up of a &quot;litany of fibs.&quot;
Irish historian Seán Duffy remarked that &quot;the battle of Stirling Bridge could have done with a bridge.&quot;

In 2009, the film was second on a list of &quot;most historically inaccurate movies&quot; in &quot;The Times&quot;. In the humorous non-fictional historiography &quot;An Utterly Impartial History of Britain&quot; (2007), author John O&#x27;Farrell claims that &quot;Braveheart&quot; could not have been more historically inaccurate, even if a Plasticine dog had been inserted in the film and the title changed to &quot;William Wallace and Gromit&quot;.

In the DVD audio commentary of &quot;Braveheart&quot;, Mel Gibson acknowledged the historical inaccuracies but defended his choices as director, noting that the way events were portrayed in the film was much more &quot;cinematically compelling&quot; than the historical fact or conventional mythos.

=== &quot;Jus primae noctis&quot; ===
Edward Longshanks is shown invoking &quot;Jus primae noctis&quot; in the film, allowing the lord of a medieval estate to take the virginity of his serfs&#x27; maiden daughters on their wedding nights. Critical medieval scholarship regards this supposed right as a myth: &quot;the simple reason why we are dealing with a myth here rests in the surprising fact that practically all writers who make any such claims have never been able or willing to cite any trustworthy source, if they have any.&quot;

=== Occupation and independence ===
The film suggests Scotland had been under English occupation for some time, at least during Wallace&#x27;s childhood, and in the run-up to the Battle of Falkirk Wallace says to the younger Bruce, &quot;[W]e&#x27;ll have what none of us have ever had before, a country of our own.&quot; In fact, Scotland had been invaded by England only the year before Wallace&#x27;s rebellion; before the death of King Alexander III it had been a fully separate kingdom.

=== Portrayal of William Wallace ===
As John Shelton Lawrence and Robert Jewett writes, &quot;Because [William] Wallace is one of Scotland&#x27;s most important national heroes and because he lived in the very distant past, much that is believed about him is probably the stuff of legend. But there is a factual strand that historians agree to&quot;, summarized from Scots scholar Matt Ewart:

A. E. Christa Canitz writes about the historical William Wallace further: &quot;[He] was a younger son of the Scottish gentry, usually accompanied by his own chaplain, well-educated, and eventually, having been appointed Guardian of the Kingdom of Scotland, engaged in diplomatic correspondence with the Hanseatic cities of Lübeck and Hamburg&quot;. She finds that in &quot;Braveheart&quot;, &quot;any hint of his descent from the lowland gentry (i.e., the lesser nobility) is erased, and he is presented as an economically and politically marginalized Highlander and &#x27;a farmer&#x27;—as one with the common peasant, and with a strong spiritual connection to the land which he is destined to liberate.&quot;

Colin McArthur writes that &quot;Braveheart&quot; &quot;constructs Wallace as a kind of modern, nationalist guerrilla leader in a period half a millennium before the appearance of nationalism on the historical stage as a concept under which disparate classes and interests might be mobilised within a nation state.&quot; Writing about &quot;Braveheart&quot;″s &quot;omissions of verified historical facts&quot;, McArthur notes that Wallace made &quot;overtures to Edward I seeking less severe treatment after his defeat at Falkirk&quot;, as well as &quot;the well-documented fact of Wallace&#x27;s having resorted to conscription and his willingness to hang those who refused to serve.&quot; Canitz posits that depicting &quot;such lack of class solidarity&quot; as the conscriptions and related hangings &quot;would contaminate the movie&#x27;s image of Wallace as the morally irreproachable &quot;primus inter pares&quot; among his peasant fighters.&quot;

=== Portrayal of Isabella of France ===
Isabella of France is shown spending a night with Wallace after the Battle of Falkirk. She later tells Edward I she is pregnant with Wallace&#x27;s child, implied to be Edward III. In reality, Isabella was a child and living in France at the time of the Battle of Falkirk, was not married to Edward II until he was already king, and Edward III was born seven years after Wallace died. The breakdown of the couple&#x27;s relationship over his liaisons, and the menacing suggestion to a dying Longshanks that she would overthrow and destroy Edward II mirror and foreshadow actual facts; although not until 1326, over 20 years after Wallace&#x27;s death, Isabella and her lover Roger Mortimer would depose – and later allegedly murder – Edward II.

=== Portrayal of Robert the Bruce ===
Robert the Bruce did change sides between the Scots loyalists and the English more than once in the earlier stages of the Wars of Scottish Independence, but he probably did not fight on the English side at the Battle of Falkirk (although this claim does appear in a few medieval sources). Later, the Battle of Bannockburn was not a spontaneous battle soon after Wallace&#x27;s execution; he had already been fighting a guerrilla campaign against the English for eight years. His title before becoming king was Earl of Carrick, not Earl of Bruce. Bruce&#x27;s father is portrayed as an infirm leper, although it was Bruce himself who allegedly suffered from leprosy in later life. The actual Bruce&#x27;s machinations around Wallace, rather than the meek idealist in the film, suggests the father–son relationship represent different aspects of the historical Bruce&#x27;s character. In the film, Bruce&#x27;s father betrays Wallace to his son&#x27;s disgust, calling it the price of his son&#x27;s crown, when in real life Wallace was betrayed by the nobleman John de Menteith.

=== Portrayal of Longshanks and Prince Edward ===
The actual Edward I was ruthless and temperamental, but the film exaggerates his negative aspects for effect. Edward enjoyed poetry and harp music, was a devoted and loving husband to his wife Eleanor of Castile, and as a religious man, he gave generously to charity; the film&#x27;s scene where he scoffs cynically at Isabella for distributing gold to the poor after Wallace refuses it as a bribe would have been unlikely. Furthermore, Edward died almost two years after Wallace&#x27;s execution, not on the same day.

The depiction of the future Edward II as an effeminate homosexual drew accusations of homophobia against Gibson.

Gibson defended his depiction of Prince Edward as weak and ineffectual, saying:

In response to Longshanks&#x27;s murder of the Prince&#x27;s male lover Phillip, Gibson replied: &quot;The fact that King Edward throws this character out a window has nothing to do with him being gay ... He&#x27;s terrible to his son, to everybody.&quot;
Gibson asserted that the reason Longshanks kills his son&#x27;s lover is that the king is a &quot;psychopath&quot;.

=== Wallace&#x27;s military campaign ===
&quot;MacGregors from the next glen&quot; joining Wallace shortly after the action at Lanark is dubious, since it is questionable whether Clan Gregor existed at that stage, and when they did emerge their traditional home was Glen Orchy, some distance from Lanark.

Wallace did win an important victory at the Battle of Stirling Bridge, but the version in &quot;Braveheart&quot; is highly inaccurate, as it has no bridge (or Andrew Moray, joint commander of the Scots army, who was fatally injured in the battle). Later, Wallace did carry out a large-scale raid into the north of England, but he did not get as far south as York, nor did he kill Edward I&#x27;s nephew.

The &quot;Irish conscripts&quot; at the Battle of Falkirk are unhistorical; there were no Irish troops at Falkirk (although many of the English army were, in fact, Welsh).

The two-handed long swords used by Gibson in the film were not in wide use in the period. A one-handed sword and shield would have been more accurate and more efficient, since in the enemy army there were a lot of archers.

==Sequel==

A sequel, &quot;Robert the Bruce&quot; (2019), continues directly on from &quot;Braveheart&quot; and features Robert the Bruce, with Angus Macfadyen reprising his role from &quot;Braveheart&quot;.

<text>Brian Wilson Aldiss (; 18 August 1925 – 19 August 2017) was an English writer, artist and anthology editor, best known for science fiction novels and short stories. His byline reads either Brian W. Aldiss or simply Brian Aldiss, except for occasional pseudonyms during the mid-1960s.

Greatly influenced by science fiction pioneer H. G. Wells, Aldiss was a vice-president of the international H. G. Wells Society. He was (with Harry Harrison) co-president of the Birmingham Science Fiction Group. Aldiss was named a Grand Master by the Science Fiction Writers of America in 1999 and inducted by the Science Fiction Hall of Fame in 2004. He received two Hugo Awards, one Nebula Award and one John W. Campbell Memorial Award. He wrote the short story &quot;Supertoys Last All Summer Long&quot; (1969), the basis for the Stanley Kubrick-developed Steven Spielberg film &quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot; (2001). Aldiss was associated with the British New Wave of science fiction.

==Life and career==
===Early life, education and military service===
Brian Wilson Aldiss was born on 18 August 1925, above his paternal grandfather&#x27;s draper&#x27;s shop in Dereham, Norfolk. When Aldiss&#x27;s grandfather died, his father, Bill (the younger of two sons), sold his share in the shop and the family left Dereham. Aldiss&#x27;s mother, Dot, was the daughter of a builder. He had an older sister who was stillborn and a younger sister. As a three-year-old, Aldiss started to write stories which his mother would bind and put on a shelf.

At the age of 6, Aldiss went to Framlingham College, but moved to Devon and was sent to board at West Buckland School in 1939 after the outbreak of World War II. As a child, he discovered the pulp magazine &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;. He eventually read all the novels by H. G. Wells, Robert Heinlein, and Philip K. Dick. In 1943, he joined the Royal Signals and saw military action in Burma.

===Writing and publishing===
His army experience inspired the novel &quot;Hothouse&quot; and the Horatio Stubbs second and third books, &quot;A Soldier Erect&quot; and &quot;A Rude Awakening&quot;, respectively.

After the war, he worked as a bookseller in Oxford. He also wrote a number of short pieces for a booksellers&#x27; trade journal about life in a fictitious bookshop, which attracted the attention of Charles Monteith, an editor at the publisher Faber and Faber. As a result, Faber and Faber published Aldiss&#x27;s first book, &quot;The Brightfount Diaries&quot; (1955), a 200-page novel in diary form about the life of a sales assistant in a bookshop.

About this time he also began to write science fiction for various magazines. According to ISFDB, his first speculative fiction in print was the short story &quot;Criminal Record&quot;, published by John Carnell in the July 1954 issue of &quot;Science Fantasy&quot;. Several of his stories appeared in 1955, including three in monthly issues of &quot;New Worlds&quot;, also edited by Carnell.

In 1954, &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper ran a competition for a short story set in the year 2500. Aldiss&#x27;s story &quot;Not For An Age&quot; was ranked third following a reader vote.

&quot;The Brightfount Diaries&quot; had been a minor success, and Faber asked Aldiss if he had any more writing they could look at with a view to publishing. Aldiss confessed to being a science fiction author, to the delight of the publishers, who had a number of science fiction fans in high places, and so his first science fiction book was published, a collection of short stories entitled &quot;Space, Time and Nathaniel&quot; (Faber, 1957). By this time, his earnings from writing matched his wages in the bookshop, and he made the decision to become a full-time writer.

Aldiss led the voting for Most Promising New Author of 1958 at the next year&#x27;s Worldcon, but finished behind &quot;no award&quot;. He was elected president of the British Science Fiction Association in 1960. He was the literary editor of the &quot;Oxford Mail&quot; newspaper from 1958 to 1969. Around 1964, he and long-time collaborator Harry Harrison started the first ever journal of science fiction criticism, &quot;Science Fiction Horizons&quot;, which during its brief span of two issues published articles and reviews by such authors as James Blish, and featured a discussion among Aldiss, C. S. Lewis, and Kingsley Amis in the first issue and an interview with William S. Burroughs in the second. In 1967 Algis Budrys listed Aldiss, J. G. Ballard, Roger Zelazny and Samuel R. Delany as &quot;an earthshaking new kind of&quot; writers, and leaders of the New Wave. Aldiss supported the New Wave movement, helping the magazine New Worlds to get financial backing from a 1967 Arts Council grant and publishing some of his more experimental work in the magazine.
Besides his own writings, he edited a number of anthologies. For Faber he edited &quot;Introducing SF&quot;, a collection of stories typifying various themes of science fiction, and &quot;Best Fantasy Stories&quot;. In 1961, he edited an anthology of reprinted short science fiction for the British paperback publisher Penguin Books under the title &quot;Penguin Science Fiction&quot;. This was remarkably successful, went into numerous reprints, and was followed up by two further anthologies: &quot;More Penguin Science Fiction&quot; (1963) and &quot;Yet More Penguin Science Fiction&quot; (1964). The later anthologies enjoyed the same success as the first, and all three were eventually published together as &quot;The Penguin Science Fiction Omnibus&quot; (1973), which also went into a number of reprints. In the 1970s, he produced several large collections of classic grand-scale science fiction, under the titles &quot;Space Opera&quot; (1974), &quot;Space Odysseys&quot; (1975), &quot;Galactic Empires&quot; (1976), &quot;Evil Earths&quot; (1976) and &quot;Perilous Planets&quot; (1978). Around this time, he edited a large-format volume &quot;Science Fiction Art&quot; (1975), with selections of artwork from the magazines and pulps.

In response to the results from the planetary probes of the 1960s and 1970s, which showed that Venus was completely unlike the hot, tropical jungle usually depicted in science fiction, Aldiss and Harrison edited an anthology &quot;Farewell, Fantastic Venus&quot;, reprinting stories based on the pre-probe ideas of Venus. He also edited, with Harrison, a series of anthologies &quot;The Year&#x27;s Best Science Fiction&quot; (Nos. 1–9, 1968–1976).

Aldiss invented a form of extremely short story called the &quot;mini-saga&quot;. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; hosted a competition for the best mini-saga for several years, and Aldiss was the judge. He edited several anthologies of the best mini-sagas.
Aldiss travelled to Yugoslavia, where he met fans in Ljubljana, Slovenia and published a travel book about Yugoslavia entitled &quot;Cities and Stones&quot; (1966), his only work in the genre. He published an alternative-history fantasy story, &quot;The Day of the Doomed King&quot; (1968), about Serbian kings in the Middle Ages, and wrote a novel called &quot;The Malacia Tapestry&quot;, about an alternative Dalmatia.

===Art===
In addition to a highly successful career as a writer, Aldiss was an accomplished artist. His first solo exhibition, &quot;The Other Hemisphere&quot;, was held in Oxford, August–September 2010, and the exhibition&#x27;s centrepiece &quot;Metropolis&quot; (see figure) has since been released as a limited edition fine art print. (The exhibition title denotes the writer/artist&#x27;s notion, &quot;words streaming from one side of his brain inspiring images in what he calls &#x27;the other hemisphere&#x27;&quot;.)

===Personal life===
In 1948, Aldiss married Olive Fortescue, secretary to the owner of Sanders&#x27; bookseller&#x27;s in Oxford, where he had worked since 1947. He had two children from his first marriage: Clive in 1955 and Caroline Wendy in 1959, but the marriage &quot;finally collapsed&quot; in 1959 and dissolved in 1965.

In 1965, he married his second wife, Margaret Christie Manson (daughter of John Alexander Christie Manson, an aeronautical engineer), a Scot and secretary to the editor of the &quot;Oxford Mail&quot;; Aldiss was 40, and she 31. They lived in Oxford and had two children together, Tim and Charlotte. She died in 1997.

===Death===
Aldiss died at his home in Headington, Oxford, on 19 August 2017, the day after his 92nd birthday.

==Awards and honours==

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1990.

Aldiss was the &quot;Permanent Special Guest&quot; at the annual International Conference on the Fantastic in the Arts (ICFA) from 1989 through 2008. He was also the Guest of Honor at the conventions in 1986 and 1999.

The Science Fiction Writers of America made him its 18th SFWA Grand Master in 1999 and the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame inducted him in 2004.

He was awarded the title of Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to literature in the 2005 Birthday Honours list.

In January 2007 he appeared on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;. His choice of record to &#x27;save&#x27; was &quot;Old Rivers&quot; sung by Walter Brennan, his choice of book was John Heilpern&#x27;s biography of John Osborne, and his luxury a banjo. The full selection of eight favourite records is on the BBC website.

On 1 July 2008 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Liverpool in recognition of his contribution to literature. The Brian W Aldiss Archive at the university holds manuscripts from the period 1943–1995.

In 2013, Aldiss was recipient of the World Fantasy Convention Award at the World Fantasy Convention in Brighton, England.

Aldiss sat on the Council of the Society of Authors.

He won two Hugo awards: in 1962 for the &quot;Hothouse&quot; series; and in 1987 for &quot;Trillion Year Spree&quot;. Aldiss also won a Nebula award in 1965 for &quot;The Saliva Tree&quot;.

*: A short novel about the huge, old galactic empire of Nuls, a giant, three-limbed, civilised alien race. Earth is just a lesser-than-third-class colony ruled by a Nul tyrant whose deceiving devices together with good willing but ineffective attempts of a Nul Signatory (roughly equivalent to Prime Minister) to clarify the abuses and with the disorganised earthling resistance reflect the complex relationship existing between imperialists and subject races which Aldiss himself had the chance of seeing at first hand when serving in India and Indonesia in the forties.

* &quot;The Primal Urge&quot; (1961, Ballantine F555), (1967, Sphere), (1976, Panther). A satire on sexual reserve, it explores the effects on society of a forehead-mounted &quot;Emotion Register&quot; that glows when the wearer experiences sexual attraction. The book was banned in Ireland.

This assemblage of stories won the Hugo Award for short fiction in 1962.
*: Set in a far future Earth, where the earth has stopped rotating, the Sun has increased output, and plants are engaged in a constant frenzy of growth and decay, like a tropical forest enhanced a thousandfold; a few small groups of elvish humans still live on the edge of extinction, beneath the giant banyan tree that covers the day side of the earth.

* &quot;The Dark Light Years&quot; (1964, Signet D2497), (1964, Faber), (1966, Four Square 1437), (1979, Panther)
*: The encounter of humans with the utods, gentle aliens whose physical and mental health requires wallowing in mud and filth, and who – though they achieved interstellar space flight – are not even recognised as intelligent by the humans. The critic Fredric Jameson described &quot;The Dark Light Years&quot; as, along with Ursula K. Le Guin&#x27;s &quot;The Word for World Is Forest&quot;, &quot;one of the major SF denunciations of the American genocide in Vietnam.&quot;
* &quot;Earthworks&quot; (1965, Faber), (1966, Doubleday), (1967, Four Square), (1967, Signet P3116), (1979, Panther), (1980, Avon)

* &quot;Barefoot in the Head&quot; (1969, Faber), (1970, Doubleday), (1972, Ace), (1974, Corgi), (1981, AVON), (1990, Gollancz VGSF Classics), a fix-up novel based on short stories: &quot;Just Passing Through&quot;, &quot;Multi-Value Motorway&quot;, &quot;Still Trajectories&quot;, &quot;The Serpent of Kundalini&quot;, &quot;Drake-Man Route&quot;, and novelettes: &quot;Auto-Ancestral Fracture&quot;, &quot;Ouspenski&#x27;s Astrabahn&quot;
*: Perhaps Aldiss&#x27;s most experimental work, this first appeared in several parts as the &quot;Acid Head War&quot; series in &quot;New Worlds&quot;. Set in a Europe some years after a flare-up in the Middle East led to Europe being attacked with bombs releasing huge quantities of long-lived hallucinogenic drugs. Into an England with a population barely maintaining a grip on reality comes a young Serb, who himself starts coming under the influence of the ambient aerosols, and finds himself leading a messianic crusade. The narration and dialogue reflects the shattering of language under the influence of the drugs, in mutating phrases and puns and allusions, in a deliberate echo of &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;.
