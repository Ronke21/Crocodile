<text>Sir Alan Ayckbourn (born 12 April 1939) is a prolific British playwright and director. As of 2025, he has written and produced 90 full-length plays in Scarborough and London and was, between 1972 and 2009, the artistic director of the Stephen Joseph Theatre in Scarborough, where all but four of his plays have received their first performance. More than 40 have subsequently been produced in the West End, at the Royal National Theatre or by the Royal Shakespeare Company since his first hit &quot;Relatively Speaking&quot; opened at the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre in 1967.

Major successes include &quot;Absurd Person Singular&quot; (1975), &quot;The Norman Conquests&quot; trilogy (1973), &quot;Bedroom Farce&quot; (1975), &quot;Just Between Ourselves&quot; (1976), &quot;A Chorus of Disapproval&quot; (1984), &quot;Woman in Mind&quot; (1985), &quot;A Small Family Business&quot; (1987), &quot;Man of the Moment&quot; (1988), &quot;House&quot; &amp; &quot;Garden&quot; (1999) and &quot;Private Fears in Public Places&quot; (2004). His plays have won numerous awards, including seven London &quot;Evening Standard&quot; Awards. They have been translated into over 35 languages and are performed on stage and television throughout the world. Ten of his plays have been staged on Broadway, attracting two Tony nominations, and one Tony award.

==Life==

===Childhood===

Ayckbourn was born in Hampstead, London. His mother, Irene Worley (&quot;Lolly&quot;) (1906–1998), was a writer of short stories who published under the name &quot;Mary James&quot;. His father, Horace Ayckbourn (1904–1965), was an orchestral violinist and was the lead violinist at the London Symphony Orchestra. His parents, who separated shortly after World War II, never married, and Ayckbourn&#x27;s mother divorced her first husband to marry again in 1948.

Ayckbourn wrote his first play at Wisborough Lodge (a preparatory school in the village of Wisborough Green) when he was about 10. While he was at prep school as a boarder, his mother wrote to tell him she was marrying Cecil Pye, a bank manager. His new family consisted of his mother, his stepfather and Christopher, his stepfather&#x27;s son by an earlier marriage. This relationship too, reportedly ran into difficulties early on.

Ayckbourn attended Haileybury and Imperial Service College, in the village of Hertford Heath and, while there, he toured Europe and America with the school&#x27;s Shakespeare company.

===Adult life===

After leaving school at 17, Ayckbourn took several temporary jobs in various places before starting a temporary position at the Scarborough Library Theatre, where he was introduced to the artistic director, Stephen Joseph. It is said that Joseph became both a mentor and father figure for Ayckbourn until his untimely death in 1967, and Ayckbourn has consistently spoken highly of him.

Ayckbourn&#x27;s career was briefly interrupted when he was called up for National Service. He was swiftly discharged, officially on medical grounds, but it is suggested that a doctor who noticed his reluctance to join the Armed Forces deliberately failed the medical as a favour. Although Ayckbourn continued to move wherever his career took him, he settled in Scarborough, eventually buying Longwestgate House, which had previously been owned by his mentor, Joseph.

In 1957, Ayckbourn married Christine Roland, another member of the Library Theatre company. Ayckbourn&#x27;s first two plays were, in fact, written jointly with her under the pseudonym of &quot;Roland Allen&quot;. They had two sons, Steven and Philip. However, the marriage had difficulties, which eventually led to their separation in 1971. Ayckbourn said that his relationship with Roland became easy once they agreed their marriage was over. About this time, he shared a home with Heather Stoney, an actress he had first met ten years earlier. Like his mother, neither he nor Roland sought an immediate divorce and it was not until thirty years later, in 1997, that they were formally divorced and Ayckbourn married Stoney. One side effect of the timing is that, when Ayckbourn was awarded a knighthood a few months before the divorce, both his first and second wives were entitled to take the title of Lady Ayckbourn.

In February 2006, he suffered a stroke in Scarborough, and stated: &quot;I hope to be back on my feet, or should I say my left leg, as soon as possible, but I know it is going to take some time. In the meantime I am in excellent hands and so is the Stephen Joseph Theatre.&quot; He left hospital after eight weeks and returned to directing after six months. The following year, Ayckbourn announced he would step down as artistic director of the Stephen Joseph Theatre. He continues, however, to write and direct his own work at the theatre.

===Influence on plays===

Since the time Ayckbourn&#x27;s plays became established in the West End, interviewers have raised the question of whether his work is autobiographical. There is no clear answer to this question. There has been only one biography, written by Paul Allen, which primarily covers his career in the theatre. Ayckbourn has frequently said he sees aspects of himself in all of his characters. In &quot;Bedroom Farce&quot; (1975), for example, he admitted to being, in some respects, all four of the men in the play. It has been suggested that, after Ayckbourn himself, the person who is used most often in his plays is his mother, particularly as Susan in &quot;Woman in Mind&quot; (1985).

What is less clear is the extent to which events in Ayckbourn&#x27;s life have influenced his writing. It is true that the theme of marriages in difficulty was heavily present throughout his plays in the early seventies, at about the time his own marriage was coming to an end. However, by that time, he had also witnessed the failure of his parents&#x27; relationships and those of some of his friends. Which relationships, if any, he drew on for his plays, is unclear. In Paul Allen&#x27;s biography, Ayckbourn is briefly compared with Dafydd and Guy in &quot;A Chorus of Disapproval&quot; (1984). Both characters feel themselves to be in trouble and there was speculation that Ayckbourn himself might have felt the same way. At the time, he had reportedly become seriously involved with another actress, which threatened his relationship with Stoney. It is unclear whether this had any effect on the writing; Paul Allen&#x27;s view is that Ayckbourn did not use his personal experiences to write his plays.

It is possible that Ayckbourn wrote plays with himself and his own situation in mind but, as Ayckbourn is portrayed as a guarded and private man, it is hard to imagine him exposing his own life in his plays to any great degree. In the biography, Paul Allen writes, with regard to a suggestion in &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; that Ayckbourn&#x27;s plays were becoming autobiographical: &quot;If we take that to mean that his plays tell his own life story, he still hasn&#x27;t started.&quot;

==Career==

===Early career and acting===

On leaving school, Ayckbourn&#x27;s theatrical career began immediately, when his French master introduced him to Sir Donald Wolfit. Ayckbourn joined Wolfit on tour to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe as an acting assistant stage manager (a role that involved both acting and stage management) for three weeks. His first experiences on the professional stage were various roles in &quot;The Strong are Lonely&quot; by Fritz Hochwälder. In the following year, Ayckbourn appeared in six other plays at the Connaught Theatre, Worthing and the Thorndike theatre, Leatherhead.

In 1957, Ayckbourn was employed by the director Stephen Joseph at the Library Theatre, Scarborough, the predecessor to the modern Stephen Joseph Theatre. Again, his role was initially as acting stage manager. This employment led to Ayckbourn&#x27;s first professional script commission, in 1958. When he complained about the quality of a script he was performing, Joseph challenged him to write a better one. The result was &quot;The Square Cat&quot;, written under the pseudonym Roland Allen and first performed in 1959. In this play, Ayckbourn himself played the character of Jerry Watiss.

In 1962, after thirty-four appearances in plays at the Library Theatre, including four of his own, Ayckbourn moved to Stoke-on-Trent to help set up the Victoria Theatre (now the New Vic), where he appeared in a further eighteen plays. His final appearance in one of his own plays was as the Crimson Gollywog in the disastrous children&#x27;s play &quot;Christmas v Mastermind&quot;. He left the Stoke company in 1964, officially to commit his time to the London production of &quot;Mr. Whatnot&quot;, but reportedly because was having trouble working with the artistic director, Peter Cheeseman. By now, his career as a writer was coming to fruition and his acting career was sidelined.

His final role on stage was as Jerry in &quot;Two for the Seesaw&quot; by William Gibson, at the Civic Theatre in Rotherham. He was left stranded on stage because Heather Stoney (his future wife) was unable to re-appear due to her props not being ready for use. This led to his conclusion that acting was more trouble than it was worth. The assistant stage manager on the production, Bill Kenwright, would go on to become one of the UK&#x27;s most successful producers.

===Writing===
Ayckbourn&#x27;s first play, &quot;The Square Cat&quot;, was sufficiently popular locally to secure further commissions, although neither this nor the following three plays had much impact beyond Scarborough. After his transfer to Victoria Theatre in Stoke-on-Trent, &quot;Christmas v Mastermind&quot;, flopped; this play is now universally regarded as Ayckbourn&#x27;s greatest disaster.

Ayckbourn&#x27;s fortunes revived in 1963 with &quot;Mr. Whatnot&quot;, which also premiered at the Victoria Theatre. This was the first play that Ayckbourn was sufficiently happy with to allow continued performances today, and the first play to receive a West End performance. However, the West End production flopped, in part due to misguided casting. After this, Ayckbourn experimented by collaborating with comedians, first writing a monologue for Tommy Cooper, and later with Ronnie Barker, who played Lord Slingsby-Craddock in the London production of &quot;Mr Whatnot&quot; in 1964, on the scripts for LWT&#x27;s &quot;Hark at Barker&quot;. Ayckbourn used the pseudonym Peter Caulfield because he was under exclusive contract to the BBC at the time.

In 1965, back at the Scarborough Library Theatre, &quot;Meet my Father&quot; was produced, and later retitled &quot;Relatively Speaking&quot;. This time, the play was a massive success, both in Scarborough and in the West End, earning Ayckbourn a congratulatory telegram from Noël Coward. This was not quite the end of Ayckbourn&#x27;s hit-and-miss record. His next play, &quot;The Sparrow&quot; ran for only three weeks at Scarborough but the following play, &quot;How the Other Half Loves&quot;, secured his runaway success as a playwright.

The height of Ayckbourn&#x27;s commercial success came with plays such as &quot;Absurd Person Singular&quot; (1975), &quot;The Norman Conquests&quot; trilogy (1973), &quot;Bedroom Farce&quot; (1975) and &quot;Just Between Ourselves&quot; (1976). These plays focused heavily on marriage in the British middle classes. The only failure during this period was a 1975 musical with Andrew Lloyd Webber, &quot;Jeeves&quot;; even this did little to dent Ayckbourn&#x27;s career.

From the 1980s, Ayckbourn moved away from the recurring theme of marriage to explore other contemporary issues. One example was &quot;Woman in Mind&quot;, a play performed entirely from the perspective of a woman going through a nervous breakdown. He also experimented with unconventional ways of writing plays: &quot;Intimate Exchanges&quot;, for example, has one beginning and sixteen possible endings, and in &quot;House &amp; Garden&quot;, two plays take place simultaneously on two separate stages. He also diversified into children&#x27;s theatre, such as &quot;Mr A&#x27;s Amazing Maze Plays&quot; and musical plays, such as &quot;By Jeeves&quot; (a more successful rewrite of the original &quot;Jeeves&quot;).

With a résumé of over seventy plays, of which more than forty have played at the National Theatre or in the West End, Alan Ayckbourn is one of England&#x27;s most successful living playwrights. Despite his success, honours and awards (which include a prestigious Laurence Olivier Award), Alan Ayckbourn remains a relatively anonymous figure, dedicated to regional theatre. Throughout his writing career, all but four of his plays premiered at the Stephen Joseph Theatre in Scarborough in its three different locations.

Ayckbourn received the CBE in 1987 and was knighted in the 1997 New Year Honours. It is frequently claimed (but not proved) that Alan Ayckbourn is the most performed living English playwright, and the second most performed of all time, after Shakespeare.

Although Ayckbourn&#x27;s plays no longer dominate the theatrical scene on the scale of his earlier works, he continues to write. Among major success has been &quot;Private Fears in Public Places&quot;, which had a hugely successful Off-Broadway run at 59E59 Theaters and, in 2006, was made into a film, &quot;Cœurs&quot;, directed by Alain Resnais. After Ayckbourn suffered a stroke, there was uncertainty as to whether he could continue to write. The play that premiered immediately after his stroke, &quot;If I Were You&quot;, had been written before his illness; the first play written afterwards, &quot;Life and Beth&quot;, premiered in the summer of 2008. Ayckbourn continues to write for the Stephen Joseph Theatre on the invitation of his successor as artistic director, Chris Monks. The first new play under this arrangement, &quot;My Wonderful Day&quot;, was performed in October 2009.

Ayckbourn continues to experiment with theatrical form. The play &quot;Roundelay&quot; opened in September 2014; before each performance, members of the audience are invited to extract five coloured ping pong balls from a bag, leaving the order in which each of the five acts is played left to chance, and allowing 120 possible permutations. In &quot;Arrivals and Departures&quot; (2013), the first half of the play is told from the point of view of one character, only for the second half to dramatise the same events from the point of view of another.

Many of Ayckbourn&#x27;s plays, including &quot;Private Fears in Public Places&quot;, &quot;Intimate Exchanges&quot;, &quot;My Wonderful Day&quot; and &quot;Neighbourhood Watch&quot;, have had their New York premiere at 59E59 Theaters as part of the annual Brits Off Broadway Festival.

In 2019, Ayckbourn had published his first novel, &quot;The Divide&quot;, which had previously been showcased during a reading at the Stephen Joseph Theatre.

As a consequence of the Covid lockdown, Ayckbourn&#x27;s 2020 play, &quot;Anno Domino,&quot; was recorded as a radio production, with Ayckbourn and his wife Heather playing all the roles. Similarly, Ayckbourn&#x27;s Covid-period 2021 play, &quot;The Girl Next Door&quot;, was streamed online and made available behind a paywall on the Stephen Joseph Theatre&#x27;s website.

In 2022, the first Ayckbourn play in around 60 years premiered in a venue other than Scarborough: &quot;All Lies&quot; at the Old Laundry in Bowness-on-Windermere.

===Directing===

Although Ayckbourn is best known as a writer, it is said that he only spends 10% of his time writing plays. Most of the remaining time is spent directing.

Ayckbourn began directing at the Scarborough Library Theatre in 1961, with a production of &quot;Gaslight&quot; by Patrick Hamilton. During that year and the next, he directed five other plays in Scarborough and, after transferring to the Victoria Theatre, in 1963 directed a further six plays. Between 1964 and 1967, much of his time was taken up by various productions of his early successes, &quot;Mr. Whatnot&quot; and &quot;Relatively Speaking&quot; and he directed only one play, &quot;The Sparrow&quot;, which he wrote and which was later withdrawn. In 1968, he resumed directing plays regularly, mostly at Scarborough. At this time he also worked as a radio drama producer for the BBC, based in Leeds.

At first, his directing career was kept separate from his writing career. It was not until 1963 that Ayckbourn directed a play of his own (a revival of &quot;Standing Room Only&quot;) and 1967 before he directed a premiere of his own (&quot;The Sparrow&quot;). The London premieres remained in the hands of other directors for longer; the first of his own plays to be directed by him in London was &quot;Bedroom Farce,&quot; in 1977.

After the death of Stephen Joseph in 1967, the Director of Productions was appointed on an annual basis. Ayckbourn was offered the position in 1969 and 1970, succeeding Rodney Wood, but he handed the position over to Caroline Smith in 1971, having spent most that year in the US with &quot;How the Other Half Loves&quot;. He became Director of Productions again in 1972 and, on 12 November of that year, he was made the permanent artistic director of the theatre.

In mid-1986, Ayckbourn accepted an invitation to work as a visiting director for two years at the National Theatre in London, to form his own company, and perform a play in each of the three auditoria, provided at least one was a new play of his own. He used a stock company that included performers such as Michael Gambon, Polly Adams and Simon Cadell. The three plays became four: &quot;Tons of Money&quot; by Will Evans and Valentine, with adaptations by Ayckbourn (Lyttelton); Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;A View From the Bridge&quot; (Cottesloe); his own play &quot;A Small Family Business&quot; (Olivier) and John Ford&#x27;s &quot;&#x27;Tis Pity She&#x27;s a Whore&quot; (Olivier again). During this time, Ayckbourn shared his role of artistic director of the Stephen Joseph Theatre with Robin Herford and returned in 1987 to direct the premiere of &quot;Henceforward...&quot;.

He announced in 1999 that he would step back from directing the work of other playwrights, to concentrate on his own plays, the last one being Rob Shearman&#x27;s &quot;Knights in Plastic Armour&quot; in 1999; he made one exception in 2002, when he directed the world premiere of Tim Firth&#x27;s &quot;The Safari Party&quot;.

In 2002, following a dispute over the Duchess Theatre&#x27;s handling of &quot;Damsels in Distress&quot;, Ayckbourn sharply criticised both this and the West End&#x27;s treatment of theatre in general and, in particular, their casting of celebrities. Although he did not explicitly say he would boycott the West End, he did not return to direct in there again until 2009, with a revival of &quot;Woman in Mind&quot;. He did, however, allow other West End producers to revive &quot;Absurd Person Singular&quot; in 2007 and &quot;The Norman Conquests&quot; in 2008.

Ayckbourn suffered a stroke in February 2006 and returned to work in September; the premiere of his 70th play &quot;If I Were You&quot; at the Stephen Joseph Theatre came the following month.

He announced in June 2007 that he would retire as artistic director of the Stephen Joseph Theatre after the 2008 season. His successor, Chris Monks, took over at the start of the 2009–2010 season but Ayckbourn remained to direct premieres and revivals of his work at the theatre, beginning with &quot;How the Other Half Loves&quot; in June 2009.

In March 2010, he directed an in-the-round revival of his play &quot;Taking Steps&quot; at the Orange Tree Theatre, winning universal press acclaim.

In July 2014, Ayckbourn directed a musical adaptation of &quot;The Boy Who Fell into A Book&quot;, with musical adaptation and lyrics by Paul James and music by Eric Angus and Cathy Shostak. The show ran in The Stephen Joseph Theatre and received critical acclaim.

<text>Alpha Centauri (, α Cen, or Alpha Cen) is a triple star system in the southern constellation of Centaurus. It consists of three stars: Rigil Kentaurus (), Toliman (), and Proxima Centauri (). Proxima Centauri is the closest star to the Sun at 4.2465 light-years (1.3020 pc).

 and B are Sun-like stars (class G and K, respectively) that together form the binary star system . To the naked eye, these two main components appear to be a single star with an apparent magnitude of −0.27. It is the brightest star in the constellation and the third-brightest in the night sky, outshone by only Sirius and Canopus.

 (Rigil Kentaurus) has 1.1 times the mass () and 1.5 times the luminosity of the Sun (), while (Toliman) is smaller and cooler, at and less than . The pair orbit around a common centre with an orbital period of 79 years. Their elliptical orbit is eccentric, so that the distance between A and B varies from 35.6 astronomical units (AU), or about the distance between Pluto and the Sun, to or about the distance between Saturn and the Sun. One astronomical unit is the distance from Earth to the Sun, 150 million kilometers.

Proxima Centauri, or , is a small faint red dwarf (class M). Though not visible to the naked eye, Proxima Centauri is the closest star to the Sun at a distance of , slightly closer than . Currently, the distance between Proxima Centauri and is about , equivalent to about 430 times the radius of Neptune&#x27;s orbit.

Proxima Centauri has one confirmed planet: Proxima b, an Earth-sized planet in the habitable zone (though it is unlikely to be habitable), one candidate planet, Proxima d, sub-Earth which orbits very closely to the star, and the controversial Proxima c, a mini-Neptune  astronomical units away. may have a Neptune-sized planet in the habitable zone, though it is not yet known with certainty to be planetary in nature and could be an artifact of the discovery mechanism. has no known planets: planet , purportedly discovered in 2012, was later disproven, and no other planet has yet been confirmed.

== Etymology and nomenclature ==
α Centauri (Latinised to Alpha Centauri) is the system&#x27;s designation given by J. Bayer in 1603. It belongs to the constellation Centaurus, named after the half human, half horse creature in Greek mythology. Heracles accidentally wounded the centaur and placed him in the sky after his death. Alpha Centauri marks the right front hoof of the Centaur. The common name Rigil Kentaurus is a Latinisation of the Arabic translation &quot;Rijl al-Qinṭūrus,&quot; meaning &quot;the Foot of the Centaur&quot;. &quot;Qinṭūrus&quot; is the Arabic transliteration of the Greek (Kentaurus). The name is frequently abbreviated to Rigil Kent () or even Rigil, though the latter name is better known for Rigel ( Orionis).

An alternative name found in European sources, Toliman, is an approximation of the Arabic &quot;aẓ-Ẓalīmān&quot; (in older transcription, &quot;aṭ-Ṭhalīmān&quot;), meaning &#x27;the (two male) Ostriches&#x27;, an appellation Zakariya al-Qazwini had applied to the pair of stars Lambda and Mu Sagittarii; it was often not clear on old star maps which name was intended to go with which star (or stars), and the referents changed over time. The name Toliman originates with Jacobus Golius&#x27; 1669 edition of Al-Farghani&#x27;s &quot;Compendium&quot;. Tolimân is Golius&#x27; Latinisation of the Arabic name &quot;the ostriches&quot;, the name of an asterism of which Alpha Centauri formed the main star.

 was discovered in 1915 by Robert T. A. Innes, who suggested that it be named Proxima Centaurus, . The name Proxima Centauri later became more widely used and is now listed by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) as the approved proper name; it is frequently abbreviated to Proxima.

In 2016, the Working Group on Star Names of the IAU, having decided to attribute proper names to individual component stars rather than to multiple systems, approved the name Rigil Kentaurus () as being restricted to and the name Proxima Centauri () for On 10 August 2018, the IAU approved the name Toliman () for 

=== Other names ===
During the 19th century, the northern amateur popularist E.H. Burritt used the now-obscure name Bungula (). Its origin is not known, but it may have been coined from the Greek letter beta () and Latin &#x27;hoof&#x27;, originally for Beta Centauri (the other hoof).

In Chinese astronomy, &quot;Nán Mén&quot;, meaning Southern Gate, refers to an asterism consisting of Alpha Centauri and Epsilon Centauri. Consequently, the Chinese name for Alpha Centauri itself is &quot;Nán Mén Èr&quot;, the Second Star of the Southern Gate.

To the Indigenous Boorong people of northwestern Victoria in Australia, Alpha Centauri and Beta Centauri are Bermbermgle, two brothers noted for their courage and destructiveness, who speared and killed Tchingal &quot;The Emu&quot; (the Coalsack Nebula). The form in Wotjobaluk is Bram-bram-bult.

== Observation ==
To the naked eye, appears to be a single star, the brightest in the southern constellation of Centaurus. Their apparent angular separation varies over about 80 years between 2 and 22 arcseconds (the naked eye has a resolution of 60 arcsec), but through much of the orbit, both are easily resolved in binoculars or small telescopes. At −0.27 apparent magnitude (combined for A and B magnitudes ), Alpha Centauri is a first-magnitude star and is fainter only than Sirius and Canopus. It is the outer star of The Pointers or The Southern Pointers, so called because the line through Beta Centauri (Hadar/Agena), some 4.5° west, points to the constellation Crux—the Southern Cross. The Pointers easily distinguish the true Southern Cross from the fainter asterism known as the False Cross.

South of about 29° South latitude, is circumpolar and never sets below the horizon. North of about 29° N latitude, Alpha Centauri never rises. Alpha Centauri lies close to the southern horizon when viewed from latitude 29° N to the equator (close to Hermosillo and Chihuahua City in Mexico; Galveston, Texas; Ocala, Florida; and Lanzarote, the Canary Islands of Spain), but only for a short time around its culmination. The star culminates each year at local midnight on 24 April and at local 9 p.m. on 8 June.

As seen from Earth, Proxima Centauri is 2.2° southwest from this distance is about four times the angular diameter of the Moon. Proxima Centauri appears as a deep-red star of a typical apparent magnitude of 11.1 in a sparsely populated star field, requiring moderately sized telescopes to be seen. Listed as V645 Cen in the &quot;General Catalogue of Variable Stars&quot;, version 4.2, this UV Ceti star or &quot;flare star&quot; can unexpectedly brighten rapidly by as much as 0.6 magnitude at visual wavelengths, then fade after only a few minutes. Some amateur and professional astronomers regularly monitor for outbursts using either optical or radio telescopes. In August 2015, the largest recorded flares of the star occurred, with the star becoming 8.3 times brighter than normal on 13 August, in the B band (blue light region).

Alpha Centauri may be inside the G-cloud of the Local Bubble, and its nearest known system is the binary brown dwarf system Luhman 16, at from it.

=== Observational history ===
Alpha Centauri is listed in the 2nd century the star catalog appended to Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot;. He gave its ecliptic coordinates, but texts differ as to whether the ecliptic latitude reads or . (Presently the ecliptic latitude is , but it has decreased by a fraction of a degree since Ptolemy&#x27;s time due to proper motion.) In Ptolemy&#x27;s time, Alpha Centauri was visible from Alexandria, Egypt, at but, due to precession, its declination is now , and it can no longer be seen at that latitude. English explorer Robert Hues brought Alpha Centauri to the attention of European observers in his 1592 work &quot;Tractatus de Globis&quot;, along with Canopus and Achernar, noting:

The binary nature of Alpha Centauri AB was recognized in December 1689 by Jean Richaud, while observing a passing comet from his station in Puducherry. Alpha Centauri was only the third binary star to be discovered, preceded by Mizar AB and Acrux.

The large proper motion of Alpha Centauri AB was discovered by Manuel John Johnson, observing from Saint Helena, who informed Thomas Henderson at the Royal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope of it. The parallax of Alpha Centauri was subsequently determined by Henderson from many exacting positional observations of the AB system between April 1832 and May 1833. He withheld his results, however, because he suspected they were too large to be true, but eventually published them in 1839 after Bessel released his own accurately determined parallax for in 1838. For this reason, Alpha Centauri is sometimes considered as the second star to have its distance measured because Henderson&#x27;s work was not fully acknowledged at first. (The distance of Alpha Centauri from the Earth is now reckoned at 4.396 light-years or .)

Later, John Herschel made the first micrometrical observations in 1834. Since the early 20th century, measures have been made with photographic plates.

By 1926, William Stephen Finsen calculated the approximate orbit elements close to those now accepted for this system. All future positions are now sufficiently accurate for visual observers to determine the relative places of the stars from a binary star ephemeris. Others, like D. Pourbaix (2002), have regularly refined the precision of new published orbital elements.

Robert T. A. Innes discovered Proxima Centauri in 1915 by blinking photographic plates taken at different times during a proper motion survey. These showed large proper motion and parallax similar in both size and direction to those of which suggested that Proxima Centauri is part of the system and slightly closer to Earth than . As such, Innes concluded that Proxima Centauri was the closest star to Earth yet discovered.

=== Kinematics ===
All components of display significant proper motion against the background sky. Over centuries, this causes their apparent positions to slowly change. Proper motion was unknown to ancient astronomers. Most assumed that the stars were permanently fixed on the celestial sphere, as stated in the works of the philosopher Aristotle. In 1718, Edmond Halley found that some stars had significantly moved from their ancient astrometric positions.

In the 1830s, Thomas Henderson discovered the true distance to by analysing his many astrometric mural circle observations. He then realised this system also likely had a high proper motion. In this case, the apparent stellar motion was found using Nicolas Louis de Lacaille&#x27;s astrometric observations of 1751–1752, by the observed differences between the two measured positions in different epochs.

Calculated proper motion of the centre of mass for is about 3620 mas/y (milliarcseconds per year) toward the west and 694 mas/y toward the north, giving an overall motion of 3686 mas/y in a direction 11° north of west. The motion of the centre of mass is about 6.1 arcmin each century, or 1.02° each millennium. The speed in the western direction is and in the northerly direction . Using spectroscopy the mean radial velocity has been determined to be around towards the Solar System. This gives a speed with respect to the Sun of , very close to the peak in the distribution of speeds of nearby stars.

Since is almost exactly in the plane of the Milky Way as viewed from Earth, many stars appear behind it. In early May 2028, will pass between the Earth and a distant red star, when there is a 45% probability that an Einstein ring will be observed. Other conjunctions will also occur in the coming decades, allowing accurate measurement of proper motions and possibly giving information on planets.

==== Predicted future changes ====

Based on the system&#x27;s common proper motion and radial velocities, will continue to change its position in the sky significantly and will gradually brighten. For example, in about 6,200 CE, α Centauri&#x27;s true motion will cause an extremely rare first-magnitude stellar conjunction with Beta Centauri, forming a brilliant optical double star in the southern sky. It will then pass just north of the Southern Cross or Crux, before moving northwest and up towards the present celestial equator and away from the galactic plane. By about 26,700 CE, in the present-day constellation of Hydra, will reach perihelion at away, though later calculations suggest that this will occur in 27,000 AD. At its nearest approach, α Centauri will attain a maximum apparent magnitude of −0.86, comparable to present-day magnitude of Canopus, but it will still not surpass that of Sirius, which will brighten incrementally over the next 60,000 years, and will continue to be the brightest star as seen from Earth (other than the Sun) for the next 210,000 years.

== Stellar system ==
Alpha Centauri is a triple star system, with its two main stars, A and B, together comprising a binary component. The &quot;AB&quot; designation, or older &quot;A×B&quot;, denotes the mass centre of a main binary system relative to companion star(s) in a multiple star system. &quot;AB-C&quot; refers to the component of Proxima Centauri in relation to the central binary, being the distance between the centre of mass and the outlying companion. Because the distance between Proxima (C) and either of Alpha Centauri A or B is similar, the AB binary system is sometimes treated as a single gravitational object.

=== Orbital properties ===
The A and B components of Alpha Centauri have an orbital period of 79.762 years. Their orbit is moderately eccentric, as it has an eccentricity of almost 0.52; their closest approach or periastron is , or about the distance between the Sun and Saturn; and their furthest separation or apastron is , about the distance between the Sun and Pluto. The most recent periastron was in August 1955 and the next will occur in May 2035; the most recent apastron was in May 1995 and will next occur in 2075.

Viewed from Earth, the apparent orbit of A and B means that their separation and position angle (PA) are in continuous change throughout their projected orbit. Observed stellar positions in 2019 are separated by 4.92 arcsec through the PA of 337.1°, increasing to 5.49 arcsec through 345.3° in 2020. The closest recent approach was in February 2016, at 4.0 arcsec through the PA of 300°. The observed maximum separation of these stars is about 22 arcsec, while the minimum distance is 1.7 arcsec. The widest separation occurred during February 1976, and the next will be in January 2056.

Alpha Centauri C is about from Alpha Centauri AB, equivalent to about 5% of the distance between Alpha Centauri AB and the Sun. Until 2017, measurements of its small speed and its trajectory were of too little accuracy and duration in years to determine whether it is bound to Alpha Centauri AB or unrelated.

Radial velocity measurements made in 2017 were precise enough to show that Proxima Centauri and Alpha Centauri AB are gravitationally bound. The orbital period of Proxima Centauri is approximately years, with an eccentricity of 0.5, much more eccentric than Mercury&#x27;s. Proxima Centauri comes within of AB at periastron, and its apastron occurs at .

=== Physical properties ===
Asteroseismic studies, chromospheric activity, and stellar rotation (gyrochronology) are all consistent with the Alpha Centauri system being similar in age to, or slightly older than, the Sun. Asteroseismic analyses that incorporate tight observational constraints on the stellar parameters for the Alpha Centauri stars have yielded age estimates of Gyr, Gyr, 6.4 Gyr, and Gyr. Age estimates for the stars based on chromospheric activity (Calcium H &amp; K emission) yield whereas gyrochronology yields Gyr. Stellar evolution theory implies both stars are slightly older than the Sun at 5 to 6 billion years, as derived by their mass and spectral characteristics.

From the orbital elements, the total mass of Alpha Centauri AB is about 
– or twice that of the Sun. The average individual stellar masses are about and , respectively, though slightly different masses have also been quoted in recent years, such as and , totaling . Alpha Centauri A and B have absolute magnitudes of +4.38 and +5.71, respectively.

==== Alpha Centauri AB System ====
===== Alpha Centauri A =====
Alpha Centauri A, also known as Rigil Kentaurus, is the principal member, or primary, of the binary system. It is a solar-like main-sequence star with a similar yellowish colour, whose stellar classification is spectral type G2-V; it is about 10% more massive than the Sun, with a radius about 22% larger. When considered among the individual brightest stars in the night sky, it is the fourth-brightest at an apparent magnitude of +0.01, being slightly fainter than Arcturus at an apparent magnitude of −0.05.

The type of magnetic activity on Alpha Centauri A is comparable to that of the Sun, showing coronal variability due to star spots, as modulated by the rotation of the star. However, since 2005 the activity level has fallen into a deep minimum that might be similar to the Sun&#x27;s historical Maunder Minimum. Alternatively, it may have a very long stellar activity cycle and is slowly recovering from a minimum phase.

===== Alpha Centauri B =====

Alpha Centauri B, also known as Toliman, is the secondary star of the binary system. It is a main-sequence star of spectral type K1-V, making it more an orange colour than Alpha Centauri A; it has around 90% of the mass of the Sun and a 14% smaller diameter. Although it has a lower luminosity than A, Alpha Centauri B emits more energy in the X-ray band. Its light curve varies on a short time scale, and there has been at least one observed flare. It is more magnetically active than Alpha Centauri A, showing a cycle of compared to 11 years for the Sun, and has about half the minimum-to-peak variation in coronal luminosity of the Sun. Alpha Centauri B has an apparent magnitude of +1.35, slightly dimmer than Mimosa.

==== Alpha Centauri C ====
Alpha Centauri C, better known as Proxima Centauri, is a small main-sequence red dwarf of spectral class M6-Ve. It has an absolute magnitude of +15.60, over 20,000 times fainter than the Sun. Its mass is calculated to be . It is the closest star to the Sun but is too faint to be visible to the naked eye.

== Planetary system ==
The Alpha Centauri system as a whole has two confirmed planets, both of them around Proxima Centauri. While other planets have been claimed to exist around all of the stars, none of the discoveries have been confirmed.

=== Planets of Proxima Centauri ===

Proxima Centauri b is a terrestrial planet discovered in 2016 by astronomers at the European Southern Observatory (ESO). It has an estimated minimum mass of 1.17 (Earth masses) and orbits approximately 0.049 AU from Proxima Centauri, placing it in the star&#x27;s habitable zone.

The discovery of Proxima Centauri c was formally published in 2020 and could be a super-Earth or mini-Neptune. It has a mass of roughly 7 and orbits about from Proxima Centauri with a period of . In June 2020, a possible direct imaging detection of the planet hinted at the presence of a large ring system. However, a 2022 study disputed the existence of this planet.

A 2020 paper refining Proxima b&#x27;s mass excludes the presence of extra companions with masses above at periods shorter than 50 days, but the authors detected a radial-velocity curve with a periodicity of 5.15 days, suggesting the presence of a planet with a mass of about . This planet, Proxima Centauri d, was detected in 2022.

=== Planets of Alpha Centauri A ===


In 2021, a candidate planet named Candidate 1 (or C1) was detected around Alpha Centauri A, thought to orbit at approximately with a period of about one year, and to have a mass between that of Neptune and one-half that of Saturn, though it may be a dust disk or an artifact. The possibility of C1 being a background star has been ruled out. If this candidate is confirmed, the temporary name C1 will most likely be replaced with the scientific designation Alpha Centauri Ab in accordance with current naming conventions.

GO Cycle 1 observations are planned for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to search for planets around Alpha Centauri A, as well as observations of Epsilon Muscae. The coronographic observations, which occurred on July 26 and 27, 2023, were failures, though there are follow-up observations in March 2024. Pre-launch estimates predicted that JWST will be able to find planets with a radius of 5 at . Multiple observations every 3–6 months could push the limit down to 3 . Post-launch estimates based on observations of HIP 65426 b find that JWST will be able to find planets even closer to Alpha Centauri A and could find a 5 planet at . Candidate 1 has an estimated radius between and orbits at . It is therefore likely within the reach of JWST observations.

=== Planets of Alpha Centauri B ===
The first claim of a planet around Alpha Centauri B was that of Alpha Centauri Bb in 2012, which was proposed to be an Earth-mass planet in a 3.2-day orbit. This was refuted in 2015 when the apparent planet was shown to be an artifact of the way the radial velocity data was processed.

A search for transits of planet Bb was conducted with the Hubble Space Telescope from 2013 to 2014. This search detected one potential transit-like event, which could be associated with a different planet with a radius around . This planet would most likely orbit Alpha Centauri B with an orbital period of 20.4 days or less, with only a 5% chance of it having a longer orbit. The median of the likely orbits is 12.4 days. Its orbit would likely have an eccentricity of 0.24 or less. It could have lakes of molten lava and would be far too close to Alpha Centauri B to harbour life. If confirmed, this planet might be called . However, the name has not been used in the literature, as it is not a claimed discovery.

=== Hypothetical planets ===
Additional planets may exist in the Alpha Centauri system, either orbiting Alpha Centauri A or Alpha Centauri B individually, or in large orbits around Alpha Centauri AB. Because both stars are fairly similar to the Sun (for example, in age and metallicity), astronomers have been especially interested in making detailed searches for planets in the Alpha Centauri system. Several established planet-hunting teams have used various radial velocity or star transit methods in their searches around these two bright stars. All the observational studies have so far failed to find evidence for brown dwarfs or gas giants.

In 2009, computer simulations showed that a planet might have been able to form near the inner edge of Alpha Centauri B&#x27;s habitable zone, which extends from from the star. Certain special assumptions, such as considering that the Alpha Centauri pair may have initially formed with a wider separation and later moved closer to each other (as might be possible if they formed in a dense star cluster), would permit an accretion-friendly environment farther from the star. Bodies around Alpha Centauri A would be able to orbit at slightly farther distances due to its stronger gravity. In addition, the lack of any brown dwarfs or gas giants in close orbits around Alpha Centauri make the likelihood of terrestrial planets greater than otherwise. A theoretical study indicates that a radial velocity analysis might detect a hypothetical planet of in Alpha Centauri B&#x27;s habitable zone.

Radial velocity measurements of Alpha Centauri B made with the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher spectrograph were sufficiently sensitive to detect a planet within the habitable zone of the star (i.e. with an orbital period P = 200 days), but no planets were detected.

Current estimates place the probability of finding an Earth-like planet around Alpha Centauri at roughly 75%. The observational thresholds for planet detection in the habitable zones by the radial velocity method are currently (2017) estimated to be about for Alpha Centauri A, for Alpha Centauri B, and for Proxima Centauri.

Early computer-generated models of planetary formation predicted the existence of terrestrial planets around both Alpha Centauri A and B, but most recent numerical investigations have shown that the gravitational pull of the companion star renders the accretion of planets difficult. Despite these difficulties, given the similarities to the Sun in spectral types, star type, age and probable stability of the orbits, it has been suggested that this stellar system could hold one of the best possibilities for harbouring extraterrestrial life on a potential planet.

In the Solar System, it was once thought that Jupiter and Saturn were probably crucial in perturbing comets into the inner Solar System, providing the inner planets with a source of water and various other ices. However, since isotope measurements of the deuterium to hydrogen (D/H) ratio in comets Halley, Hyakutake, Hale–Bopp, 2002T7, and Tuttle yield values approximately twice that of Earth&#x27;s oceanic water, more recent models and research predict that less than 10% of Earth&#x27;s water was supplied from comets. In the system, Proxima Centauri may have influenced the planetary disk as the system was forming, enriching the area around Alpha Centauri with volatile materials. This would be discounted if, for example, happened to have gas giants orbiting (or vice versa), or if and B themselves were able to perturb comets into each other&#x27;s inner systems, as Jupiter and Saturn presumably have done in the Solar System. Such icy bodies probably also reside in Oort clouds of other planetary systems. When they are influenced gravitationally by either the gas giants or disruptions by passing nearby stars, many of these icy bodies then travel star-wards. Such ideas also apply to the close approach of Alpha Centauri or other stars to the Solar system, when, in the distant future, the Oort Cloud might be disrupted enough to increase the number of active comets.

To be in the habitable zone, a planet around Alpha Centauri A would have an orbital radius of between about 1.2 and so as to have similar planetary temperatures and conditions for liquid water to exist. For the slightly less luminous and cooler , the habitable zone is between about 0.7 and .

With the goal of finding evidence of such planets, both Proxima Centauri and were among the listed &quot;Tier-1&quot; target stars for NASA&#x27;s Space Interferometry Mission (S.I.M.). Detecting planets as small as three Earth-masses or smaller within two AU of a &quot;Tier-1&quot; target would have been possible with this new instrument. The S.I.M. mission, however, was cancelled due to financial issues in 2010.

=== Circumstellar discs ===
Based on observations between 2007 and 2012, a study found a slight excess of emissions in the 24 μm (mid/far-infrared) band surrounding , which may be interpreted as evidence for a sparse circumstellar disc or dense interplanetary dust. The total mass was estimated to be between to the mass of the Moon, or 10–100 times the mass of the Solar System&#x27;s zodiacal cloud. If such a disc existed around both stars, disc would likely be stable to and would likely be stable to This would put A&#x27;s disc entirely within the frost line, and a small part of B&#x27;s outer disc just outside.

== View from this system ==

The sky from would appear much as it does from the Earth, except that Centaurus&#x27;s brightest star, being itself, would be absent from the constellation. The Sun would appear as a white star of apparent magnitude +0.5, roughly the same as the average brightness of Betelgeuse from Earth. It would be at the antipodal point of current right ascension and declination, at (2000), in eastern Cassiopeia, easily outshining all the rest of the stars in the constellation. With the placement of the Sun east of the magnitude 3.4 star Epsilon Cassiopeiae, nearly in front of the Heart Nebula, the &quot;W&quot; line of stars of Cassiopeia would have a &quot;/W&quot; shape.

Other nearby stars&#x27; placements may be affected somewhat drastically. Sirius, at 9.2 light years away from the system, would still be the brightest star in the night sky, with a magnitude of -1.2, but would be located in Orion less than a degree away from Betelgeuse. Procyon, which would also be at a slightly further distance than from the Sun, would move to outshine Pollux in the middle of Gemini.

A planet around either or B would see the other star as a very bright secondary. For example, an Earth-like planet at from (with a revolution period of 1.34 years) would get Sun-like illumination from its primary, and would appear 5.7–8.6 magnitudes dimmer (−21.0 to −18.2), 190–2,700 times dimmer than but still 150–2,100 times brighter than the full Moon. Conversely, an Earth-like planet at from (with a revolution period of 0.63 years) would get nearly Sun-like illumination from its primary, and would appear 4.6–7.3 magnitudes dimmer (−22.1 to −19.4), 70 to 840 times dimmer than but still 470–5,700 times brighter than the full Moon.

Proxima Centauri would appear dim as one of many stars, being magnitude 4.5 at its current distance, and magnitude 2.6 at periastron.

== Future exploration ==

Alpha Centauri is a first target for crewed or robotic interstellar exploration. Using current spacecraft technologies, crossing the distance between the Sun and Alpha Centauri would take several millennia, though the possibility of nuclear pulse propulsion or laser light sail technology, as considered in the Breakthrough Starshot program, could make the journey to Alpha Centauri in 20 years. An objective of such a mission would be to make a fly-by of, and possibly photograph, planets that might exist in the system. The existence of Proxima Centauri b, announced by the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in August 2016, would be a target for the Starshot program.

NASA released a mission concept in 2017 that would send a spacecraft to Alpha Centauri in 2069, scheduled to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the first crewed lunar landing in 1969, Even at speed 10% of the speed of light (about 108 million km/h), which NASA experts say may be possible, it would take a spacecraft 44 years to reach the constellation, by the year 2113, and would take another 4 years for a signal, by the year 2117 to reach Earth. The concept received no further funding or development.

== Historical distance estimates ==

==In culture==
Alpha Centauri has been recognized and associated throughout history, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere. Polynesians have been using Alpha Centauri for their star navigation and have called it Kamailehope. In the Ngarrindjeri culture of Australia, Alpha Centauri represents with Beta Centauri two sharks chasing a stingray, the Southern Cross, and in Incan culture it with Beta Centauri form the eyes of a llama-shaped dark constellation embedded in the band of stars that the visible Milky Way forms in the sky. In ancient Egypt it was also revered and in China it is known as part of the South Gate asterism. Due to its proximity, the Alpha Centauri system has appeared in many works of fiction.

The Sagan Planet Walk in Ithaca, New York, is a walkable scale model of the solar system. An obelisk representing the scaled position of Alpha Centauri has been added at ʻImiloa Astronomy Center in Hawaii.

<text>Amiga is a family of personal computers produced by Commodore from 1985 until the company&#x27;s bankruptcy in 1994, with production by others afterward. The original model is one of a number of mid-1980s computers with 16-bit or 16/32-bit processors, 256 KB or more of RAM, mouse-based GUIs, and significantly improved graphics and audio compared to previous 8-bit systems. These include the Atari ST—released earlier the same year—as well as the Macintosh and Acorn Archimedes. The Amiga differs from its contemporaries through custom hardware to accelerate graphics and sound, including sprites, a blitter, and four channels of sample-based audio. It runs a pre-emptive multitasking operating system called AmigaOS.

The Amiga 1000, based on the Motorola 68000 microprocessor, was released in July 1985. Production problems kept it from becoming widely available until early 1986. While early advertisements cast the computer as an all-purpose business machine, especially with the Sidecar IBM PC compatibility add-on, the Amiga was most commercially successful as a home computer with a range of video games and creative software. The bestselling model, the Amiga 500, was introduced in 1987 along with the more expandable Amiga 2000. The 1990 Amiga 3000 includes a minor update to the graphics hardware via the Enhanced Chip Set, also used in subsequent models.

The Amiga established a niche in audio and multimedia. The first music tracker was written for the Amiga, and it became a popular platform music creation. The 3D rendering packages LightWave 3D, Imagine, and Traces (a predecessor to Blender) originated on the system. The 1990 third-party Video Toaster made the Amiga a comparatively low cost option for video production. In later years, the Amiga started losing market share to IBM PC compatibles and video game consoles, eventually leading to Commodore&#x27;s bankruptcy in 1994 and then the end of Amiga. Commodore is estimated to have sold an 4.85 million Amigas. Various groups have since released spiritual successors.

== History ==
=== Concept and early development ===
Jay Miner joined Atari, Inc. in the 1970s and led development of the Atari Video Computer System&#x27;s graphics and sound chip, the Television Interface Adaptor. When complete, the team began developing a much more sophisticated set of chips, CTIA, ANTIC and POKEY, that formed the basis of the Atari 8-bit computers.

With the 8-bit line&#x27;s launch in 1979, the team once again started looking at a next generation chipset. Nolan Bushnell had sold the company to Warner Communications in 1978, and the new management was much more interested in the existing lines than development of new products that might cut into their sales. Miner wanted to start work with the new Motorola 68000, but management was only interested in another 6502 based system. Miner left the company, and, for a time, the industry.

In 1979, Larry Kaplan left Atari and founded Activision. In 1982, Kaplan was approached by a number of investors who wanted to develop a new game platform. Kaplan hired Miner to run the hardware side of the newly formed company, &quot;Hi-Toro&quot;. The system was code-named &quot;Lorraine&quot; in keeping with Miner&#x27;s policy of giving systems female names, in this case the company president&#x27;s wife, Lorraine Morse. When Kaplan left the company late in 1982, Miner was promoted to head engineer and the company relaunched as Amiga Corporation.

The Amiga hardware was designed by Miner, RJ Mical, and Dale Luck. A breadboard prototype for testing and development was largely completed by late 1983, and shown at the January 1984 Consumer Electronics Show (CES). At the time, the operating system was not ready, so the machine was demonstrated with the &quot;Boing Ball&quot; demo, a real-time animation showing a red-and-white spinning ball bouncing and casting a shadow; this bouncing ball later became the official logo of Escom subsidiary Amiga Technologies. CES attendees had trouble believing the computer being demonstrated had the power to display such a demo and searched in vain for the &quot;real&quot; computer behind it.

A further developed version of the system was demonstrated at the June 1984 CES and shown to many companies in hopes of garnering further funding, but found little interest in a market that was in the final stages of the video game crash of 1983.

In March, Atari expressed a tepid interest in Lorraine for its potential use in a games console or home computer tentatively known as the . The talks were progressing slowly, and Amiga was running out of money. A temporary arrangement in June led to a $500,000 loan from Atari to Amiga to keep the company going. The terms required the loan to be repaid at the end of the month, otherwise Amiga would forfeit the Lorraine design to Atari.

=== Commodore ===
By the end of the video game crash of 1983, Warner was desperate to sell Atari. In January 1984, Jack Tramiel resigned from Commodore, taking some Commodore employees to his new company, Tramel Technology. This included a number of the senior technical staff, where they began development of a new 68000-based machine. In June, Tramiel arranged a no-cash deal to take over Atari, reforming Tramel Technology as Atari Corporation.

Commodore was left without a workable path to creating a next-generation home computer, and it offered to fund Amiga development. The two companies were initially arranging a license agreement before Commodore offered to purchase Amiga outright.

By late 1984, the prototype breadboard chipset had successfully been turned into integrated circuits, and the system hardware was being readied for production. At this time, the operating system was not ready, and led to a deal to port TRIPOS. TRIPOS was a multitasking system written in BCPL during the 1970s for the PDP-11 minicomputer. This early version was known as AmigaDOS and the GUI as Workbench. The BCPL parts were later rewritten in the C language, and the entire system became AmigaOS.

The system was enclosed in a pizza box form factor case. A late change was the introduction of vertical supports on either side of the case to provide a &quot;garage&quot; under the main section of the system where the keyboard could be stored.

===Launch===
The first model was announced in 1985 as simply &quot;The Amiga from Commodore&quot;, later to be retroactively dubbed the Amiga 1000. They were first offered for sale in August, but by October only 50 had been built, all of which were used by Commodore. Machines only began to arrive in quantity in mid-November, meaning they missed the Christmas buying rush. By the end of the year, they had sold 35,000 machines, and severe cashflow problems made the company pull out of the January 1986 CES. Bad or entirely missing marketing, forcing the development team to move to the east coast, notorious stability problems and other blunders limited sales in early 1986 to between 10,000 and 15,000 units a month. 120,000 units were reported as having been sold from the machine&#x27;s launch up to the end of 1986.

=== Later models ===
In late 1985, Thomas Rattigan was promoted to COO of Commodore, and then to CEO in February 1986. He immediately implemented an ambitious plan that covered almost all of the company&#x27;s operations. Among these was the long-overdue cancellation of the now outdated PET and VIC-20 lines, as well as a variety of poorly selling Commodore 64 offshoots and the Commodore 900 workstation effort.

Another one of the changes was to split the Amiga into two products, a new high-end version of the Amiga aimed at the creative market, and a cost-reduced version that would take over for the Commodore 64 in the low-end market. These new designs were released in 1987 as the Amiga 2000 and Amiga 500, the latter of which went on to widespread success and became their best selling model.

Similar high-end/low-end models would make up the Amiga line for the rest of its history; follow-on designs included the Amiga 3000/Amiga 500 Plus/Amiga 600, and the Amiga 4000/Amiga 1200. These models incorporated a series of technical upgrades known as the ECS and AGA, which added higher resolution displays among many other improvements and simplifications.

The Amiga line sold an estimated 4,910,000 machines over its lifetime. The machines were most popular in the UK and Germany, with about 1.5 million sold in each country, and sales in the high hundreds of thousands in other European nations. The machine was less popular in North America, where an estimated 700,000 were sold. In the United States, the Amiga found a niche with enthusiasts and in vertical markets for video processing and editing. In Europe, it was more broadly popular as a home computer and often used for video games. Beginning in 1988 it overlapped with the 16-bit Mega Drive, then the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in the early 1990s. Commodore UK&#x27;s Kelly Sumner did not see Sega or Nintendo as competitors, but instead credited their marketing campaigns which spent over or for promoting video games as a whole and thus helping to boost Amiga sales.

=== Bankruptcy and aftermath ===
In spite of his successes in making the company profitable and bringing the Amiga line to market, Rattigan was soon forced out in a power struggle with majority shareholder, Irving Gould. This is widely regarded as the turning point, as further improvements to the Amiga were eroded by rapid improvements in other platforms.

Commodore shut down the Amiga division on April 26, 1994, and filed for bankruptcy three days later. Commodore&#x27;s assets were purchased by Escom, a German PC manufacturer, who created the subsidiary company Amiga Technologies. They re-released the A1200 and A4000T, and introduced a new 68060 version of the A4000T. Amiga Technologies researched and developed the Amiga Walker prototype. They presented the machine publicly at CeBit, but Escom went bankrupt in 1996. Some Amigas were still made afterwards for the North American market by QuikPak, a small Pennsylvania-based firm who was the manufacturer of Amigas for Escom. 

After a reported sale to VisCorp fell through, a U.S. Wintel PC manufacturer, Gateway 2000, eventually purchased the Amiga branch and technology in 1997. QuickPak attempted but failed to license Amiga from Gateway and build new models. Gateway was then working on a brand new Amiga platform, likely encouraged by a desire to be independent of Microsoft and Intel. However this did not materialize and in 2000, Gateway sold the Amiga brand to Amiga, Inc., without having released any products. Amiga, Inc. licensed the rights to sell hardware using the AmigaOne brand to Eyetech Group and Hyperion Entertainment. In 2019, Amiga, Inc. sold its intellectual property to Amiga Corporation.

== Hardware ==

The Amiga has a custom chipset consisting of several coprocessors which handle audio, video, and direct memory access independently of the central processing unit (CPU). This architecture gave the Amiga a performance edge over its competitors, particularly for graphics-intensive applications and games.

The architecture uses two distinct bus subsystems: the chipset bus and the CPU bus. The chipset bus allows the coprocessors and CPU to address &quot;Chip RAM&quot;. The CPU bus provides addressing to conventional RAM, ROM and the Zorro II or Zorro III expansion subsystems. This enables independent operation of the subsystems. The CPU bus can be much faster than the chipset bus. CPU expansion boards may provide additional custom buses. Additionally, &quot;busboards&quot; or &quot;bridgeboards&quot; may provide ISA or PCI buses.

=== Central processing unit ===
The most popular models from Commodore, including the Amiga 1000, Amiga 500, and Amiga 2000, use the Motorola 68000 as the CPU. From a developer&#x27;s point of view, the 68000 provides a full suite of 32-bit operations, but the chip can address only 16 MB of physical memory and is implemented using a 16-bit arithmetic logic unit and has a 16-bit external data bus, so 32-bit computations are transparently handled as multiple 16-bit values at a performance cost. The later Amiga 2500 and the Amiga 3000 models use fully 32-bit, 68000-compatible processors from Motorola with improved performance and larger addressing capability.

CPU upgrades were offered by both Commodore and third-party manufacturers. Most Amiga models can be upgraded either by direct CPU replacement or through expansion boards. Such boards often included faster and higher capacity memory interfaces and hard disk controllers.

Towards the end of Commodore&#x27;s time in charge of Amiga development, there were suggestions that Commodore intended to move away from the 68000 series to higher performance RISC processors, such as the PA-RISC. Those ideas were never developed before Commodore filed for bankruptcy. Despite this, third-party manufacturers designed upgrades featuring a combination of 68000 series and PowerPC processors along with a PowerPC native microkernel and software. Later Amiga clones featured PowerPC processors only.

=== Custom chipset ===
The custom chipset at the core of the Amiga design appeared in three distinct generations, with a large degree of backward-compatibility. The Original Chip Set (OCS) appeared with the launch of the A1000 in 1985. OCS was eventually followed by the modestly improved Enhanced Chip Set (ECS) in 1990 and finally by the partly 32-bit Advanced Graphics Architecture (AGA) in 1992. Each chipset consists of several coprocessors that handle graphics acceleration, digital audio, direct memory access and communication between various peripherals (e.g., CPU, memory and floppy disks). In addition, some models featured auxiliary custom chips that performed tasks such as SCSI control and display de-interlacing.

==== Graphics ====

All Amiga systems can display full-screen animated planar graphics with 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 (EHB Mode), or 4096 colors (HAM Mode). Models with the AGA chipset (A1200 and A4000) also have non-EHB 64, 128, 256, and 262144 (HAM8 Mode) color modes and a palette expanded from 4096 to 16.8 million colors.

The Amiga chipset can &quot;genlock&quot;, which is the ability to adjust its own screen refresh timing to match an incoming NTSC or PAL video signal. When combined with setting transparency, this allows an Amiga to overlay an external video source with graphics. This ability made the Amiga popular for many applications, and provides the ability to do character generation and CGI effects far more cheaply than earlier systems. This ability has been frequently utilized by wedding videographers, TV stations and their weather forecasting divisions (for weather graphics and radar), advertising channels, music video production, and desktop videographers. The NewTek Video Toaster was made possible by the genlock ability of the Amiga.

In 1988, the release of the Amiga A2024 fixed-frequency monochrome monitor with built-in framebuffer and flicker fixer hardware provided the Amiga with a choice of high-resolution graphic modes (1024×800 for NTSC and 1024×1024 for PAL).

==== ReTargetable Graphics ====
ReTargetable Graphics is an API for device drivers mainly used by 3rd party graphics hardware to interface with AmigaOS via a set of libraries. The software libraries may include software tools to adjust resolution, screen colors, pointers and screenmodes. The standard Intuition interface is limited to display depths of 8 bits, while RTG makes it possible to handle higher depths like 24-bits.

==== Sound ====
The sound chip, named Paula, supports four PCM sound channels (two for the left speaker and two for the right) with 8-bit resolution for each channel and a 6-bit volume control per channel. The analog output is connected to a low-pass filter, which filters out high-frequency aliasing when the Amiga is using a lower sampling rate (see Nyquist frequency). The brightness of the Amiga&#x27;s power LED is used to indicate the status of the Amiga&#x27;s low-pass filter. The filter is active when the LED is at normal brightness, and deactivated when dimmed (or off on older A500 Amigas). On Amiga 1000 (and first Amiga 500 and Amiga 2000 model), the power LED had no relation to the filter&#x27;s status, and a wire needed to be manually soldered between pins on the sound chip to disable the filter. Paula can read arbitrary waveforms at arbitrary rates and amplitudes directly from the system&#x27;s RAM, using direct memory access (DMA), making sound playback without CPU intervention possible.

Although the hardware is limited to four separate sound channels, software such as &quot;OctaMED&quot; uses software mixing to allow eight or more virtual channels, and it was possible for software to mix two hardware channels to achieve a single 14-bit resolution channel by playing with the volumes of the channels in such a way that one of the source channels contributes the most significant bits and the other the least.

The quality of the Amiga&#x27;s sound output, and the fact that sound hardware is part of the standard chipset and easily addressed by software, were standout features of Amiga hardware unavailable on IBM PC compatibles for years. Third-party sound cards exist that provide DSP functions, multi-track direct-to-disk recording, multiple hardware sound channels and 16-bit and beyond resolutions. A retargetable sound API called AHI was developed allowing these cards to be used transparently by the OS and software.

=== Kickstart firmware ===
Kickstart is the firmware upon which AmigaOS is bootstrapped. Its purpose is to initialize the Amiga hardware and core components of AmigaOS and then attempt to boot from a bootable volume, such as a floppy disk or hard disk drive. Most models (excluding the Amiga 1000) come equipped with Kickstart on an embedded ROM-chip.
There are various editions of Kickstart ROMs starting with Kickstart v1.1 for the Amiga 1000, v1.2 and v1.3 for the A500, Kickstart v2.1 on A500+, Kickstart v2.2 for A600 and dual ROMs for Kickstart v3.0 and 3.1 for A1200 and A4000. After Commodore&#x27;s demise there have been new Kickstart v3.1 ROMs made available for both the A500 and A600 Computers. Amiga Software is mostly backward compatible, but v2.1 ROMs and newer differ slightly, which can cause software glitches with earlier programs. To help address this and to get earlier programs to work with later Kickstart ROMs, some tools have been produced such as RELOKIK 1.4 and MAKE IT WORK! for the A600 and A1200. They revert the system to temporarily boot in Kickstart v1.3.

=== Keyboard and mouse ===
The keyboard on Amiga computers is similar to that found on a mid-80s IBM PC: Ten function keys, a numeric keypad, and four separate directional arrow keys. Caps Lock and Control share space to the left of A. Absent are Home, End, Page Up, and Page Down keys: These functions are accomplished on Amigas by pressing shift and the appropriate arrow key. The Amiga keyboard adds a Help key, which a function key usually acts as on PCs (usually F1). In addition to the Control and Alt modifier keys, the Amiga has 2 &quot;Amiga&quot; keys, rendered as &quot;Open Amiga&quot; and &quot;Closed Amiga&quot; similar to the Open/Closed Apple logo keys on Apple II keyboards. The left is used to manipulate the operating system (moving screens and the like) and the right delivers commands to the application. The absence of Num lock frees space for more mathematical symbols around the numeric pad.

Like IBM-compatible computers, the mouse has two buttons, but in AmigaOS, pressing and holding the right button replaces the system status line at the top of the screen with a Maclike menu bar. As with Apple&#x27;s Mac OS prior to Mac OS 8, menu options are selected by releasing the button over that option, not by left clicking. Menu items that have a Boolean toggle state can be left clicked whilst the menu is kept open with the right button, which allows the user – for example – to set some selected text to bold, underline and italics in one visit to the menus.

The mouse plugs into one of two Atari joystick ports used for joysticks, game paddles, and graphics tablets. Although compatible with analog joysticks, Atari-style digital joysticks became standard. Unusually, two independent mice can be connected to the joystick ports; some games, such as Lemmings, were designed to take advantage of this.

=== Other peripherals and expansions ===
The Amiga was one of the first computers for which inexpensive sound sampling and video digitization accessories were available. As a result of this and the Amiga&#x27;s audio and video capabilities, the Amiga became a popular system for editing and producing both music and video.

Many expansion boards were produced for Amiga computers to improve the performance and capability of the hardware, such as memory expansions, SCSI controllers, CPU boards, and graphics boards. Other upgrades include genlocks, network cards for Ethernet, modems, sound cards and samplers, video digitizers, extra serial ports, and IDE controllers. Additions after the demise of Commodore company are USB cards. The most popular upgrades were memory, SCSI controllers and CPU accelerator cards. These were sometimes combined into one device.

Early CPU accelerator cards used the full 32-bit CPUs of the 68000 family such as the Motorola 68020 and Motorola 68030, almost always with 32-bit memory and usually with FPUs and MMUs or the facility to add them. Later designs feature the Motorola 68040 or Motorola 68060. Both CPUs feature integrated FPUs and MMUs. Many CPU accelerator cards also had integrated SCSI controllers.

Phase5 designed the PowerUP boards (Blizzard PPC and CyberStorm PPC) featuring both a 68k (a 68040 or 68060) and a PowerPC (603 or 604) CPU, which are able to run the two CPUs at the same time and share the system memory. The PowerPC CPU on PowerUP boards is usually used as a coprocessor for heavy computations; a powerful CPU is needed to run MAME for example, but even decoding JPEG pictures and MP3 audio was considered heavy computation at the time. It is also possible to ignore the 68k CPU and run Linux on the PPC via project Linux APUS, but a PowerPC-native AmigaOS promised by Amiga Technologies GmbH was not available when the PowerUP boards first appeared.

24-bit graphics cards and video cards were also available. Graphics cards were designed primarily for 2D artwork production, workstation use, and later, gaming. Video cards are designed for inputting and outputting video signals, and processing and manipulating video.

In the North American market, the &quot;NewTek Video Toaster&quot; was a video effects board that turned the Amiga into an affordable video processing computer that found its way into many professional video environments. One well-known use was to create the special effects in early series of &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. Due to its NTSC-only design, it did not find a market in countries that used the PAL standard, such as in Europe. In those countries, the &quot;OpalVision&quot; card was popular, although less featured and supported than the Video Toaster. Low-cost time base correctors (TBC) specifically designed to work with the Toaster quickly came to market, most of which were designed as standard Amiga bus cards.

Various manufacturers started producing PCI busboards for the A1200, A3000 and A4000, allowing standard Amiga computers to use PCI cards such as graphics cards, Sound Blaster sound cards, 10/100 Ethernet cards, USB cards, and television tuner cards. Other manufacturers produced hybrid boards that contained an Intel x86 series chip, allowing the Amiga to emulate a PC.

PowerPC upgrades with Wide SCSI controllers, PCI busboards with Ethernet, sound and 3D graphics cards, and tower cases allowed the A1200 and A4000 to survive well into the late nineties.

Expansion boards were made by Richmond Sound Design that allow their show control and sound design software to communicate with their custom hardware frames either by ribbon cable or fiber optic cable for long distances, allowing the Amiga to control up to eight million digitally controlled external audio, lighting, automation, relay and voltage control channels spread around a large theme park, for example. See Amiga software for more information on these applications.

Other devices included the following:
* Amiga 501 with 512 KB RAM and real-time clock
* Trumpcard 500 Zorro-II SCSI interface
* GVP A530 Turbo, accelerator, RAM expansion, PC emulator

* NE2000-compatible PCMCIA Ethernet cards for Amiga 600 and Amiga 1200

==== Serial ports ====
The Commodore A2232 board provides seven RS-232C serial ports in addition to the Amiga&#x27;s built-in serial port. Each port can be driven independently at speeds of 50 to . There is, however, a driver available on Aminet that allows two of the serial ports to be driven at . The serial card used the 65CE02 CPU clocked at . This CPU was also part of the CSG 4510 CPU core that was used in the Commodore 65 computer.

==== Networking ====
Amiga has three networking interface APIs:
* AS225: the official Commodore TCP/IP stack API with hard-coded drivers in revision 1 (AS225r1) for the A2065 Ethernet and the A2060 Arcnet interfaces. In revision 2, (AS225r2) the SANA-II interface was used.
* SANA-II: a standardized API for hardware of network interfaces. It uses an inefficient buffer handling scheme, and lacks proper support for promiscuous and multicast modes.
* Miami Network Interface (MNI): an API that doesn&#x27;t have the problems that SANA-II suffers from. It requires AmigaOS v2.04 or higher.

Different network media were used:

== Models and variants ==
The original Amiga models were produced from 1985 to 1996. They are, in order of production: 1000, 2000, 500, 1500, 2500, 3000, 3000UX, 3000T, CDTV, 500+, 600, 4000, 1200, CD32, and 4000T. The PowerPC-based AmigaOne computers were later marketed beginning in 2002. Several companies and private persons have also released Amiga clones and still do so today.

=== Commodore Amiga ===
The first Amiga model, the Amiga 1000, was launched in 1985. In 2006, PC World rated the Amiga 1000 as the seventh greatest PC of all time, stating &quot;Years ahead of its time, the Amiga was the world&#x27;s first multimedia, multitasking personal computer&quot;.

Commodore updated the desktop line of Amiga computers with the Amiga 2000 in 1987, the Amiga 3000 in 1990, and the Amiga 4000 in 1992, each offering improved capabilities and expansion options. The best-selling models were the budget models, however, particularly the highly successful Amiga 500 (1987) and the Amiga 1200 (1992). The Amiga 500+ (1991) was the shortest-lived model, replacing the Amiga 500 and lasting only six months until it was phased out and replaced with the Amiga 600 (1992). The A600 was only intended as a temporary gap filler until the A1200 was available for sale. The A600 was actually designed as a portable system, hence the lack of numeric Keypad, and it was originally to be named Amiga 300. Some early A600 models have retained the original A300 logo printed on the mainboard. The Amiga 600 was quickly replaced by the Amiga 1200.

The CDTV, launched in 1991, was a CD-ROM-based game console, Computer and multimedia appliance based on the Amiga A500 with the same v1.3 Kickstart ROM, several years before CD-ROM drives were common. The cost of CDTV media production and the CD-ROM drives at the time discouraged potential buyers and the system never achieved any real success. The CDTV was however one of the first ever CD-ROM-based machines that were mass produced. A CDTV legacy is the external A570 CD-ROM drive expansion for the A500 computer. 

Commodore&#x27;s last Amiga offering before filing for bankruptcy was the Amiga CD32 (1993), a 32-bit CD-ROM games console produced until mid 1994. Although discontinued after Commodore&#x27;s demise it met with moderate commercial success in Europe. The CD32 was a next-generation CDTV, and it was designed and released by Commodore before the Playstation. It was Commodore&#x27;s last attempt to enter the ever growing video-game console market.

Following purchase of Commodore&#x27;s assets by Escom in 1995, the A1200 and A4000T continued to be sold in small quantities until 1996, though the ground lost since the initial launch and the prohibitive expense of these units meant that the Amiga line never regained any real popularity.

Several Amiga models contained references to songs by the rock band The B-52&#x27;s. Early A500 units had the words &quot;B52/ROCK LOBSTER&quot; silk-screen printed onto their printed circuit board, a reference to the song &quot;Rock Lobster&quot; The Amiga 600 referenced &quot;JUNE BUG&quot; (after the song &quot;Junebug&quot;) and the Amiga 1200 had &quot;CHANNEL Z&quot; (after &quot;Channel Z&quot;), and the CD-32 had &quot;Spellbound.&quot;

=== AmigaOS 4 systems ===
AmigaOS 4 is designed for PowerPC Amiga systems. It is mainly based on AmigaOS 3.1 source code, with some parts of version 3.9. Currently runs on both Amigas equipped with CyberstormPPC or BlizzardPPC accelerator boards, on the Teron series based AmigaOne computers built by Eyetech under license by Amiga, Inc., on the Pegasos II from Genesi/bPlan GmbH, on the ACube Systems Srl Sam440ep / Sam460ex / AmigaOne 500 systems and on the A-EON AmigaOne X1000.

AmigaOS 4.0 had been available only in developer pre-releases for numerous years until it was officially released in December 2006. Due to the nature of some provisions of the contract between Amiga Inc. and Hyperion Entertainment (the Belgian company that is developing the OS), the commercial AmigaOS 4 had been available only to licensed buyers of AmigaOne motherboards.

AmigaOS 4.0 for Amigas equipped with PowerUP accelerator boards was released in November 2007. Version 4.1 was released in August 2008 for AmigaOne systems, and in May 2011 for Amigas equipped with PowerUP accelerator boards. The most recent release of AmigaOS for all supported platforms is 4.1 update 5. Starting with release 4.1 update 4 there is an Emulation drawer containing official AmigaOS 3.x ROMs (all classic Amiga models including CD32) and relative Workbench files.

Acube Systems entered an agreement with Hyperion under which it has ported AmigaOS 4 to its Sam440ep and Sam460ex line of PowerPC-based motherboards. In 2009 a version for Pegasos II was released in co-operation with Acube Systems. In 2012, A-EON Technology Ltd manufactured and released the AmigaOne X1000 to consumers through their partner, Amiga Kit who provided end-user support, assembly and worldwide distribution of the new system.

=== Amiga hardware clones ===
Long-time Amiga developer MacroSystem entered the Amiga-clone market with their DraCo non-linear video editing system. It appears in two versions, initially a tower model and later a cube. DraCo expanded upon and combined a number of earlier expansion cards developed for Amiga (VLabMotion, Toccata, WarpEngine, RetinaIII) into a true Amiga-clone powered by the Motorola 68060 processor. The DraCo can run AmigaOS 3.1 up through AmigaOS 3.9. It is the only Amiga-based system to support FireWire for video I/O. DraCo also offers an Amiga-compatible Zorro-II expansion bus and introduced a faster custom DraCoBus, capable of transfer rates (faster than Commodore&#x27;s Zorro-III). The technology was later used in the Casablanca system, a set-top-box also designed for non-linear video editing.

In 1998, Index Information released the Access, an Amiga-clone similar to the Amiga 1200, but on a motherboard that could fit into a standard -inch drive bay. It features either a 68020 or 68030 CPU, with a AGA chipset, and runs AmigaOS 3.1.

In 1998, former Amiga employees (John Smith, Peter Kittel, Dave Haynie and Andy Finkel to mention few) formed a new company called PIOS. Their hardware platform, PIOS One, was aimed at Amiga, Atari and Macintosh users. The company was renamed to Met@box in 1999 until it folded.

The NatAmi (short for &quot;Native Amiga&quot;) hardware project began in 2005 with the aim of designing and building an Amiga clone motherboard that is enhanced with modern features. The NatAmi motherboard is a standard Mini-ITX-compatible form factor computer motherboard, powered by a Motorola/Freescale 68060 and its chipset. It is compatible with the original Amiga chipset, which has been inscribed on a programmable FPGA Altera chip on the board. The NatAmi is the second Amiga clone project after the Minimig motherboard, and its history is very similar to that of the C-One mainboard developed by Jeri Ellsworth and Jens Schönfeld. From a commercial point of view, Natami&#x27;s circuitry and design are currently closed source. One goal of the NatAmi project is to design an Amiga-compatible motherboard that includes up-to-date features but that does not rely on emulation (as in WinUAE), modern PC Intel components, or a modern PowerPC mainboard. As such, NatAmi is not intended to become another evolutionary heir to classic Amigas, such as with AmigaOne or Pegasos computers. This &quot;purist&quot; philosophy essentially limits the resulting processor speed but puts the focus on bandwidth and low latencies. The developers also recreated the entire Amiga chipset, freeing it from legacy Amiga limitations such as two megabytes of audio and video graphics RAM as in the AGA chipset, and rebuilt this new chipset by programming a modern FPGA Altera Cyclone IV chip. Later, the developers decided to create from scratch a new software-form processor chip, codenamed &quot;N68050&quot; that resides in the physical Altera FPGA programmable chip.

In 2006, two new Amiga clones were announced, both using FPGA based hardware synthesis to replace the Amiga OCS custom chipset. The first, the Minimig, is a personal project of Dutch engineer Dennis van Weeren. Referred to as &quot;new Amiga hardware&quot;, the original model was built on a Xilinx Spartan-3 development board, but soon a dedicated board was developed. The minimig uses the FPGA to reproduce the custom Denise, Agnus, Paula and Gary chips as well as both 8520 CIAs and implements a simple version of Amber. The rest of the chips are an actual 68000 CPU, ram chips, and a PIC microcontroller for BIOS control. The design for Minimig was released as open-source on July 25, 2007. In February 2008, an Italian company Acube Systems began selling Minimig boards. A third party upgrade replaces the PIC microcontroller with a more powerful ARM processor, providing more functionality such as write access and support for hard disk images. The Minimig core has been ported to the FPGArcade &quot;Replay&quot; board. The Replay uses an FPGA with about three times more capacity and that does support the AGA chipset and a 68020 soft core with 68030 capabilities. The Replay board is designed to implement many older computers and classic arcade machines.

The second is the Clone-A system announced by Individual Computers. As of mid-2007 it has been shown in its development form, with FPGA-based boards replacing the Amiga chipset and mounted on an Amiga 500 motherboard.

== Operating systems ==

=== AmigaOS ===

AmigaOS is a single-user multitasking operating system. It was one of the first commercially available consumer operating systems for personal computers to implement preemptive multitasking. It was developed first by Commodore International and initially introduced in 1985 with the Amiga 1000. John C. Dvorak wrote in &quot;PC Magazine&quot; in 1996: 

AmigaOS combines a command-line interface and graphical user interface. AmigaDOS is the disk operating system and command line portion of the OS and Workbench the native graphical windowing, graphical environment for file management and launching applications. AmigaDOS allows long filenames (up to 107 characters) with whitespace and does not require filename extensions. The windowing system and user interface engine that handles all input events is called Intuition.

The multi-tasking kernel is called Exec. It acts as a scheduler for tasks running on the system, providing pre-emptive multitasking with prioritised round-robin scheduling. It enabled true pre-emptive multitasking in as little as 256 KB of free memory.

AmigaOS does not implement memory protection; the 68000 CPU does not include a memory management unit. Although this speeds and eases inter-process communication because programs can communicate by simply passing a pointer back and forth, the lack of memory protection made the AmigaOS more vulnerable to crashes from badly behaving programs than other multitasking systems that did implement memory protection, and Amiga OS is fundamentally incapable of enforcing any form of security model since any program had full access to the system. A co-operational memory protection feature was implemented in AmigaOS 4 and could be retrofitted to old AmigaOS systems using Enforcer or CyberGuard tools.

The problem was somewhat exacerbated by Commodore&#x27;s initial decision to release documentation relating not only to the OS&#x27;s underlying software routines, but also to the hardware itself, enabling intrepid programmers who had developed their skills on the Commodore 64 to POKE the hardware directly, as was done on the older platform. While the decision to release the documentation was a popular one and allowed the creation of fast, sophisticated sound and graphics routines in games and demos, it also contributed to system instabilityas some programmers lacked the expertise to program at this level. For this reason, when the new AGA chipset was released, Commodore declined to release low-level documentation in an attempt to force developers into using the approved software routines.

The latest version for the PPC Amigas is the AmigaOS 4.1 and for the 68k Amigas is the AmigaOS 3.2.2

==== Influence on other operating systems ====
AmigaOS directly or indirectly inspired the development of various operating systems. MorphOS and AROS clearly inherit heavily from the structure of AmigaOS as explained directly in articles regarding these two operating systems. AmigaOS also influenced BeOS, which featured a centralized system of Datatypes, similar to that present in AmigaOS. Likewise, DragonFly BSD was also inspired by AmigaOS as stated by Dragonfly developer Matthew Dillon who is a former Amiga developer. WindowLab and amiwm are among several window managers for the X Window System seek to mimic the Workbench interface. IBM licensed the Amiga GUI from Commodore in exchange for the REXX language license. This allowed OS/2 to have the WPS (Workplace Shell) GUI shell for OS/2 2.0, a 32-bit operating system.

=== Unix and Unix-like systems ===
Commodore-Amiga produced Amiga Unix, informally known as Amix, based on AT&amp;T SVR4. It supports the Amiga 2500 and Amiga 3000 and is included with the Amiga 3000UX. Among other unusual features of Amix is a hardware-accelerated windowing system that can scroll windows without copying data. Amix is not supported on the later Amiga systems based on 68040 or 68060 processors.

Other, still maintained, operating systems are available for the classic Amiga platform, including Linux and NetBSD. Both require a CPU with MMU such as the 68020 with 68851 or full versions of the 68030, 68040 or 68060. There is also a version of Linux for Amigas with PowerPC accelerator cards. Debian and Yellow Dog Linux can run on the AmigaOne.

There is an official, older version of OpenBSD. The last Amiga release is 3.2. MINIX 1.5.10 also runs on Amiga.

=== Emulating other systems ===
The Amiga Sidecar is a complete IBM PC XT compatible computer contained in an expansion card. It was released by Commodore in 1986 and promoted as a way to run business software on the Amiga 1000.

== Amiga software ==
In the late 1980s and early 1990s the platform became particularly popular for gaming, demoscene activities and creative software uses. During this time commercial developers marketed a wide range of games and creative software, often developing titles simultaneously for the Atari ST due to the similar hardware architecture. Popular creative software included 3D rendering (ray-tracing) packages, bitmap graphics editors, desktop video software, software development packages and &quot;tracker&quot; music editors.

Until the late 1990s the Amiga remained a popular platform for non-commercial software, often developed by enthusiasts, and much of which was freely redistributable. An on-line archive, Aminet, was created in 1991 and until the late-1990s was the largest public archive of software, art and documents for any platform.

== Marketing ==

The name &quot;Amiga&quot; was chosen by the developers from the Spanish word for a female friend, because they knew Spanish, and because it occurred before Apple and Atari alphabetically. It also conveyed the message that the Amiga computer line was &quot;user friendly&quot; as a pun or play on words.

The first official Amiga logo was a rainbow-colored double check mark. In later marketing material Commodore largely dropped the checkmark and used logos styled with various typefaces. Although it was never adopted as a trademark by Commodore, the &quot;Boing Ball&quot; has been synonymous with Amiga since its launch. It became an unofficial and enduring theme after a visually impressive animated demonstration at the 1984 Winter Consumer Electronics Show in January 1984 showing a checkered ball bouncing and rotating. Following Escom&#x27;s purchase of Commodore in 1996, the Boing Ball theme was incorporated into a new logo.

Early Commodore advertisements attempted to cast the computer as an all-purpose business machine, though the Amiga was most commercially successful as a home computer. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s Commodore primarily placed advertising in computer magazines and occasionally in national newspapers and on television.

== Legacy ==
Since the demise of Commodore, various groups have marketed successors to the original Amiga line:

* Genesi sold PowerPC based hardware under the Pegasos brand running AmigaOS and MorphOS;
* Eyetech sold PowerPC based hardware under the AmigaOne brand from 2002 to 2005 running AmigaOS 4;
* Amiga Kit distributes and sells PowerPC based hardware under the AmigaOne brand from 2010 to present day running AmigaOS 4;
* ACube Systems sells the AmigaOS 3 compatible Minimig system with a Freescale MC68SEC000 CPU (Motorola 68000 compatible) and AmigaOS 4 compatible Sam440 / Sam460 / AmigaOne 500 systems with PowerPC processors;
* A-EON Technology Ltd sells the AmigaOS 4 compatible AmigaOne X1000 system with P.A. Semi PWRficient PA6T-1682M processor, X5000 and A1222+ computers.
* AmigaKit Ltd produce the A600GS and A1200NG computers systems. They also manufacture and sell a wide range of aftermarket components to refurbished classic systems.
* ASB Computer Spain sell numerous items from aftermarket components to refurbished classic systems.

AmigaOS and MorphOS are commercial proprietary operating systems. AmigaOS 4, based on AmigaOS 3.1 source code with some parts of version 3.9, is developed by Hyperion Entertainment and runs on PowerPC based hardware. MorphOS, based on some parts of AROS source code, is developed by MorphOS Team and is continued on Apple and other PowerPC based hardware.

There is also AROS, a free and open source operating system (re-implementation of the AmigaOS 3.1 APIs), for Amiga 68k, x86 and ARM hardware (one version runs Linux-hosted on the Raspberry Pi). In particular, AROS for Amiga 68k hardware aims to create an open source Kickstart ROM replacement for emulation purpose and/or for use on real &quot;classic&quot; hardware.

=== Magazines ===
&quot;Amiga Format&quot; continued publication until 2000. &quot;Amiga Active&quot; was launched in 1999 and was published until 2001.

Several magazines are in publication today: Print magazine Amiga Addict started publication in 2020.&quot;Amiga Future&quot;, which is available in both English and German; &quot;Bitplane.it&quot;, a bimonthly magazine in Italian; and &quot;AmigaPower&quot;, a long-running French magazine.

=== Trade shows ===
The Amiga continues to be popular enough that fans to support conferences such as Amiga37 which had over 50 vendors.

== Uses ==
The Amiga series of computers found a place in early computer graphic design and television presentation. Season 1 and part of season 2 of the television series &quot;Babylon 5&quot; were rendered in LightWave 3D on Amigas. Other television series using Amigas for special effects included &quot;SeaQuest DSV&quot; and &quot;Max Headroom&quot;.

In addition, many celebrities and notable individuals have made use of the Amiga:

* Andy Warhol was an early user of the Amiga and appeared at the launch, where he made a computer artwork of Debbie Harry. Warhol used the Amiga to create a new style of art made with computers, and was the author of a multimedia opera called &quot;You Are the One&quot;, which consists of an animated sequence featuring images of actress Marilyn Monroe assembled in a short movie with a soundtrack. The video was discovered on two old Amiga floppies in a drawer in Warhol&#x27;s studio and repaired in 2006 by the Detroit Museum of New Art. The pop artist has been quoted as saying: &quot;The thing I like most about doing this kind of work on the Amiga is that it looks like my work in other media&quot;.
* Artist Jean &quot;Moebius&quot; Giraud credits the Amiga he bought for his son as a bridge to learning about &quot;using paint box programs&quot;. He uploaded some of his early experiments to the file sharing forums on CompuServe.
* Futurist and science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke used an Amiga computer to calculate and explore Mandelbrot sets in the 1988 documentary film &quot;God, the Universe and Everything Else&quot;.
* The &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic film &quot;UHF&quot; contains a computer-animated music video parody of the Dire Straits song &quot;Money for Nothing&quot;, titled &quot;Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies*&quot;. According to the DVD commentary track, this spoof was created on an Amiga home computer.
* Rolf Harris used an Amiga to digitize his hand-drawn art work for animation on his television series &quot;Rolf&#x27;s Cartoon Club&quot;.
* Debbie Harry appeared together with Andy Warhol (see above) at launch.
* Todd Rundgren&#x27;s video &quot;Change Myself&quot; was produced with Toaster and Lightwave.
* Scottish pop artist Calvin Harris composed his 2007 debut album &quot;I Created Disco&quot; with an Amiga 1200.
* Susumu Hirasawa, a Japanese progressive-electronic artist, is known for using Amigas to compose and perform music, aid his live shows and make his promotional videos. He has also been inspired by the Amiga, and has referenced it in his lyrics. His December 13, 1994 &quot;Adios Jay&quot; Interactive Live Show was dedicated to (then recently deceased) Jay Miner. He also used the Amiga to create the virtual drummer TAINACO, who was a CG rendered figure whose performance was made with Elan Performer and was projected with DCTV. He also composed and performed &quot;Eastern-boot&quot;, the AmigaOS 4 boot jingle.
* Electronic musician Max Tundra created his three albums with an Amiga 500.
* Bob Casale, keyboardist and guitarist of the new wave band Devo, used Amiga computer graphics on the album cover to Devo&#x27;s album &quot;Total Devo&quot;.
* Most of &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot;&#x27;s music was created on an Amiga computer, converted to MIDI, and then reconverted to the game&#x27;s music format.&lt;ref name=&quot;Masuda&#x27;s blog post about HeartGold/SoulSilver music&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* American professional skateboarder Tony Hawk used an Amiga 2000 during the late 1980s to early 1990s. NewTek sent him a Video Toaster for his Amiga in exchange for appearing in a promotional video alongside Wil Wheaton and Penn Jillette, which he later used for editing a promotional video for the TurboDuo game &quot;Lords of Thunder&quot; in 1993.
* Veteran actor Dick Van Dyke also owned an Amiga equipped with a Video Toaster, where he is credited with the creation of 3D-rendered effects used on &quot;Diagnosis: Murder&quot; and &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show Revisited&quot;. Van Dyke has displayed his computer-generated imagery work at SIGGRAPH, and continues to work with LightWave 3D.
* A number of notable producers used OctaMED for composition and live performance of Drum and Bass, Jungle, and various other sub-genres of electronic dance music on Amiga systems, occasionally in conjunction with additional synthesizers. These include: Aphrodite, DJ Zinc, Omni Trio, and Paradox, among others.
* Electronic musician Deaton Chris Anthony uses an Amiga to produce music (in addition to a modern Mac-based setup). Anthony has referred to the computer as his &quot;inspiration creator&quot;.

===Special purpose applications===
* Amigas were used in various NASA laboratories to keep track of low orbiting satellites until 2004. Amigas were used at Kennedy Space Center to run strip-chart recorders, to format and display data, and control stations of platforms for Delta rocket launches.
* Palomar Observatory used Amigas to calibrate and control the charge-coupled devices in their telescopes, as well as to display and store the digitized images they collected.
* London Transport Museum developed their own interactive multi-media software for the CD32 including a virtual tour of the museum.
* Amiga 500 motherboards were used, in conjunction with a LaserDisc player and genlock device, in arcade games manufactured by American Laser Games.
* A custom Amiga 4000T motherboard was used in the HDI 1000 medical ultrasound system built by Advanced Technology Labs.
*, the Grand Rapids Public School district uses a Commodore Amiga 2000 with 1200 baud modem to automate its air conditioning and heating systems for the 19 schools covered by the GRPS district. The system has been operating day and night for decades.
* The Weather Network used Amigas to display the weather on TV.

<text>The actinophryids are an order of heliozoa, a polyphyletic array of stramenopiles, having a close relationship with pedinellids and &quot;Ciliophrys&quot;. They are common in fresh water and occasionally found in marine and soil habitats. Actinophryids are unicellular and roughly spherical in shape, with many axopodia that radiate outward from the cell body. Axopodia are a type of pseudopodia that are supported by hundreds of microtubules arranged in interlocking spirals and forming a needle-like internal structure or axoneme. Small granules, extrusomes, that lie under the membrane of the body and axopodia capture flagellates, ciliates and small metazoa that make contact with the arms.

==Description==

Actinophryids are largely aquatic protozoa with a spherical cell body and many needle-like axopodia. They resemble the shape of a sun due to this structure, which is the inspiration for their common name: heliozoa, or &quot;sun-animalcules&quot;. Their bodies, without arms, range in size from a few tens of micrometers to slightly under a millimeter across.

The outer region of cell body is often vacuolated. The endoplasm of actinophryids is less vacuolated than the outer layer, and a sharp boundary layer may be seen by light microscopy. The organisms can be either mononucleate, with a single, well defined nucleus in the center of the cell body, or multinucleate, with 10 or more nuclei located under the outer vacuolated layer of cytoplasm. The cytoplasm of actinophryids is often granular, similar to that of &quot;Amoeba&quot;.

Actinophryid cells may fuse when feeding, creating larger aggregated organisms. Fine granules that occur just under the cell membrane are used up when food vacuoles form to enclose prey. Actinophryids may also form cysts when food is not readily available. A layer of siliceous plates is deposited under the cell membrane during the encystment process.
Contractile vacuoles are common in these organisms, which are presumed to use them to maintain body volume by expelling fluids to compensate for the entry of water by osmosis. Contractile vacuoles are visible as clear bulges from the surface of the cell body that slowly fill then rapidly deflate, expelling their contents into the environment.

===Axopodia===
The most distinctive characteristic of the actinophryids is their axopodia. These axopodia consist of a central, rigid rod which is coated in a thin layer of ectoplasm. In &quot;Actinophrys&quot; the axonemes end on the surface of the central nucleus, and in the multicellular &quot;Actinosphaerium&quot; they end at or near nuclei. The axonemes are composed of microtubules arranged in a double spiral pattern characteristic of the order. Due to their long, parallel construction, these microtubules demonstrate strong birefringence.

These axopodia are used for prey capture, in movement, cell fusion and perhaps division. They are stiff but may flex especially near their tips, and are highly dynamic, undergoing frequent construction and destruction. When used to collect prey items, two methods of capture have been noted, termed axopodial flow and rapid axopodial contraction. Axopodial flow involves the slow movement of a prey item along the surface of the axopod as the ectoplasm itself moves, while rapid axopodial contraction involves the collapse of the axoneme&#x27;s microtubule structure. This behavior has been documented in many species, including &quot;Actinosphaerium nucleofilum&quot;, &quot;Actinophrys sol&quot;, and &quot;Raphidiophrys contractilis&quot;. The rapid axopodial contraction occurs at high speed, often in excess of 5mm/s or tens of body lengths per second.

The axopodial contractions have been shown to be highly sensitive to environmental factors such as temperature and pressure as well as chemical signals like Ca2+ and colchicine.

===Reproduction===

Reproduction in actinophryids generally takes place via fission, where one parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells. For multinucleate heliozoa, this process is plasmotomic as the nuclei are not duplicated prior to division. It has been observed that reproduction appears to be a response to food scarcity, with an increased number of divisions following the removal of food and larger organisms during times of food excess.

Actinophryids also undergo autogamy during times of food scarcity. This is better described as genetic reorganization than reproduction, as the number of individuals produced is the same as the initial number. Nonetheless, it serves as a way to increase genetic diversity within an individual which may improve the likelihood of expressing favorable genetic traits.

Plastogamy has also been extensively documented in actinophryids, especially in multinucleate ones. &quot;Actinosphaerium&quot; were observed to combine freely without the combination of nuclei, and this process sometimes resulted in more or less individuals than originally combined. This process is not caused merely by contact between two individuals but can be caused by damage to the cell body.

===Cyst function and formation===

Under unfavourable conditions, some species will form a cyst. This is often the product of autogamy, in which case the cysts produced are zygotes. Cells undergoing this process withdraw their axopodia, adhere to the substrate, and take on an opaque and grayish appearance. This cyst then divides until only uninucleate cells remain. The cyst wall is thickly layered 7–8 times and includes gelatinous layers, layers of silica plates, and iron.

==Taxonomy==
Originally placed in Heliozoa (Sarcodina), the actinophryids are now understood to be part of the stramenopiles. They are unrelated to centrohelid and desmothoracid heliozoa with which they had been previously classified.

There are several genera included within this classification. &quot;Actinophrys&quot; are smaller and have a single, central nucleus. Most have a cell body 40–50 micrometer in diameter with axopods around 100 μm in length, though this varies significantly. &quot;Actinosphaerium&quot; are several times larger, from 200 to 1000 μm in diameter, with many nuclei and are found exclusively in fresh water. A third genus, &quot;Camptonema&quot;, has a debated status. It has been observed once and was treated as a junior subjective synonym of &quot;Actinosphaerium&quot; by Mikrjukov &amp; Patterson in 2001, but as a valid genus by Cavalier-Smith &amp; Scoble (2013). &quot;Heliorapha&quot; is a further debated taxon, it being a new generic vehicle for the species &quot;azurina&quot; that was initially assigned to the genus &quot;Ciliophrys&quot;.

==Classification==
According to the latest review of actinophryid classifications, they are organized into two suborders, three families and three genera.

* Order Actinophryida [Actinophrydia ; Actinophrydea ]

<doc id="1988" wikidata="Q42188" url="?curid=1988" title="Abel Tasman">
<text>Abel Janszoon Tasman (; 160310 October 1659) was a Dutch seafarer and explorer, best known for his voyages of 1642 and 1644 in the service of the Dutch East India Company (VOC). He was responsible for the naming of New Zealand, as well as being the eponym of Tasmania.

Born in 1603 in Lutjegast, Netherlands, Tasman started his career as a merchant seaman and became a skilled navigator. In 1633, he joined the VOC and sailed to Batavia, now Jakarta, Indonesia. He participated in several voyages, including one to Japan. In 1642, Tasman was appointed by the VOC to lead an expedition to explore the uncharted regions of the Southern Pacific Ocean. His mission was to discover new trade routes and to establish trade relations with the native inhabitants. After leaving Batavia, Tasman sailed westward to Mauritius, then south to the Roaring Forties, then eastward, and reached the coast of Tasmania, which he named Van Diemen&#x27;s Land after his patron. He then sailed north east, and was the first European to discover the west coast of New Zealand, which he named &quot;Staten Landt&quot;, but later renamed &quot;Nieuw Zeeland&quot; after the Dutch province of Zeeland.

Despite his achievements, Tasman&#x27;s expedition was not entirely successful. The encounter with the Māori people on the South Island of New Zealand resulted in a violent confrontation, which left four of Tasman&#x27;s men dead. He returned to Batavia without having made any significant contact with the native inhabitants or establishing any trade relations. Nonetheless, Tasman&#x27;s expedition paved the way for further exploration and colonization of Australia and New Zealand by the British. Tasman continued to serve the Dutch East India Company until his death in 1659, leaving behind a legacy as one of the greatest explorers of his time.

==Origins and early life==
Abel Tasman was born around 1603 in Lutjegast, a small village in the province of Groningen, in the north of the Netherlands. The oldest available source mentioning him is dated 27 December 1631 when, as a seafarer living in Amsterdam, the 28-year-old became engaged to marry 21-year-old Jannetje Tjaers, of Palmstraat in the Jordaan district of the city.

== Relocation to the Dutch East Indies ==

Employed by the Dutch East India Company (VOC), Tasman sailed from Texel (Netherlands) to Batavia, now Jakarta, in 1633 taking the southern Brouwer Route. While based in Batavia, Tasman took part in a voyage to Seram Island (in what is now the Maluku Province in Indonesia) because the locals had sold spices to other European nationalities than the Dutch. He had a narrow escape from death when in an incautious landing several of his companions were killed by the inhabitants of the island.

By August 1637, Tasman was back in Amsterdam, and the following year he signed on for another ten years and took his wife with him to Batavia. On 25 March 1638 he tried to sell his property in the Jordaan, but the purchase was cancelled.

He was second-in-command of a 1639 expedition of exploration into the north Pacific under Matthijs Quast. The fleet included the ships &quot;Engel&quot; and &quot;Gracht&quot; and reached Fort Zeelandia (Dutch Formosa) and Deshima (an artificial island off Nagasaki, Japan).

==First major voyage==
In August 1642, the Council of the Indies, consisting of Antonie van Diemen, Cornelis van der Lijn, Joan Maetsuycker, Justus Schouten, Salomon Sweers, Cornelis Witsen, and Pieter Boreel in Batavia dispatched Tasman and Franchoijs Jacobszoon Visscher on a voyage of exploration to little-charted areas east of the Cape of Good Hope, west of Staten Land (near the Cape Horn of South America) and south of the Solomon Islands.

One of the objectives was to obtain knowledge of &quot;all the totally unknown&quot; Provinces of Beach. This was a purported yet non-existent landmass said to have plentiful gold, which had appeared on European maps since the 15th century, as a result of an error in some editions of Marco Polo&#x27;s works.

The expedition was to use two small ships, &quot;Heemskerck&quot; and &quot;Zeehaen&quot;.

===Mauritius===

In accordance with Visscher&#x27;s directions, Tasman sailed from Batavia on 14 August 1642 and arrived at Mauritius on 5 September 1642, according to the captain&#x27;s journal. The reason for this was the crew could be fed well on the island; there was plenty of fresh water and timber to repair the ships. Tasman got the assistance of the governor Adriaan van der Stel.

Because of the prevailing winds, Mauritius was chosen as a turning point. After a four-week stay on the island, both ships left on 8 October using the Roaring Forties to sail east as fast as possible. (No one had gone as far as Pieter Nuyts in 1626/27.) On 7 November, snow and hail influenced the ship&#x27;s council to alter course to a more north-easterly direction, with the intention of having the Solomon Islands as their destination.

=== Tasmania ===
On 24 November 1642, Tasman reached and sighted the west coast of Tasmania, north of Macquarie Harbour. He named his discovery Van Diemen&#x27;s Land, after Antonio van Diemen, Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies.

Proceeding south, Tasman skirted the southern end of Tasmania and turned north-east. He then tried to work his two ships into Adventure Bay on the east coast of South Bruny Island, but he was blown out to sea by a storm. This area he named Storm Bay. Two days later, on 1 December, Tasman anchored to the north of Cape Frederick Hendrick just north of the Forestier Peninsula. On 2 December, two ship&#x27;s boats under the command of the Pilot, Major Visscher, rowed through the Marion Narrows into Blackman Bay, and then west to the outflow of Boomer Creek where they gathered some edible &quot;greens&quot;. Tasman named the bay, Frederick Hendrik Bay, which included the present North Bay, Marion Bay and what is now Blackman Bay. (Tasman&#x27;s original naming, Frederick Henrick Bay, was mistakenly transferred to its present location by Marion Dufresne in 1772). The next day, an attempt was made to land in North Bay. However, because the sea was too rough, a ship&#x27;s carpenter swam through the surf and planted the Dutch flag. Tasman then claimed formal possession of the land on 3 December 1642.

For two more days, he continued to follow the east coast northward to see how far it went. When the land veered to the north-west at Eddystone Point, he tried to follow the coast line but his ships were suddenly hit by the Roaring Forties howling through Bass Strait. Tasman was on a mission to find the Southern Continent not more islands, so he abruptly turned away to the east and continued his continent-hunting.

=== New Zealand ===

Tasman had intended to proceed in a northerly direction but as the wind was unfavourable he steered east. The expedition endured a rough voyage and in one of his diary entries Tasman claimed that his compass was the only thing that had kept him alive.

On 13 December 1642 Tasman and his crew became the first Europeans to reach New Zealand when they sighted the north-west coast of the South Island. Tasman named it &quot;Staten Landt&quot; &quot;in honour of the States General&quot; (Dutch parliament). He wrote, &quot;it is possible that this land joins to the Staten Landt but it is uncertain&quot;, referring to Isla de los Estados, a landmass of the same name at the southern tip of South America, encountered by the Dutch navigator Jacob Le Maire in 1616. However, in 1643 Brouwer&#x27;s expedition to Valdivia found out that Staaten Landt was separated by sea from the hypothetical Southern Land. Tasman continued: &quot;We believe that this is the mainland coast of the unknown Southland.&quot; Tasman thought he had found the western side of the long-imagined &quot;Terra Australis&quot; that stretched across the Pacific to near the southern tip of South America. On 14 December 1642 Tasman&#x27;s ships anchored 7 km offshore c. 20km south of Cape Foulwind near Greymouth. The ships were observed by Māori who named a place on this coast Tiropahi (the place were a large sailing ship was seen).

After sailing north then east for five days, the expedition anchored about from the coast off what is now Golden Bay. A group of Māori paddled out in a waka (canoe) and attacked some sailors who were rowing between the two Dutch vessels. Four sailors were clubbed to death with patu. As Tasman sailed out of the bay he observed 22 waka near the shore, of which &quot;eleven swarming with people came off towards us&quot;. The waka approached the &quot;Zeehaen&quot; which fired and hit a man in the largest waka holding a small white flag. Canister shot also hit the side of a waka. Archaeologist Ian Barber suggests that local Māori were trying to secure a cultivation field under ritual protection (tapu) where they believed the Dutch were attempting to land. December was at the mid-point of the locally important sweet potato/kūmara (&quot;Ipomoea batatas&quot;) growing season. Tasman named the area &quot;Murderers&#x27; Bay&quot;.

The expedition then sailed north, sighting Cook Strait, which separates the North and South Islands of New Zealand, and which it mistook for a bight and named &quot;Zeehaen&#x27;s Bight&quot;. Two names that the expedition gave to landmarks in the far north of New Zealand still endure: Cape Maria van Diemen and Three Kings Islands. (&quot;Kaap Pieter Boreels&quot; was renamed Cape Egmont by Captain James Cook 125 years later.)

=== Return voyage ===
En route back to Batavia, Tasman came across the Tongan archipelago on 20 January 1643. While passing the Fiji Islands Tasman&#x27;s ships came close to being wrecked on the dangerous reefs of the north-eastern part of the Fiji group. He charted the eastern tip of Vanua Levu and Cikobia-i-Lau before making his way back into the open sea.

The expedition turned north-west towards New Guinea and arrived back in Batavia on 15 June 1643.

== Second major voyage ==
Tasman left Batavia on 30 January 1644 on his second voyage with three ships (&quot;Limmen&quot;, &quot;Zeemeeuw&quot; and the tender &quot;Braek&quot;). He followed the south coast of New Guinea eastwards in an attempt to find a passage to the eastern side of New Holland. However, he missed the Torres Strait between New Guinea and Australia, probably due to the numerous reefs and islands obscuring potential routes, and continued his voyage by following the shore of the Gulf of Carpentaria westwards along the north Australian coast. He mapped the north coast of Australia, making observations on New Holland and its people. He arrived back in Batavia in August 1644.

From the point of view of the Dutch East India Company, Tasman&#x27;s explorations were a disappointment: he had neither found a promising area for trade nor a useful new shipping route. Although Tasman was received courteously on his return, the company was upset that Tasman had not fully explored the lands he found, and decided that a more &quot;persistent explorer&quot; should be chosen for any future expeditions. For over a century, until the era of James Cook, Tasmania and New Zealand were not visited by Europeans; mainland Australia was visited, but usually only by accident.

== Later life ==
On 2 November 1644, Abel Tasman was appointed a member of the Council of Justice in Batavia. He went to Sumatra in 1646, and in August 1647 to Siam (now Thailand) with letters from the company to the King. In May 1648, he was in charge of an expedition sent to Manila to try to intercept and loot the Spanish silver ships coming from America, but he had no success and returned to Batavia in January 1649. In November 1649, he was charged and found guilty of having in the previous year hanged one of his men without trial, was suspended from his office of commander, fined, and made to pay compensation to the relatives of the sailor. On 5 January 1651, he was formally reinstated in his rank and spent his remaining years at Batavia. He was in good circumstances, being one of the larger landowners in the town. He died at Batavia on 10 October 1659 and was survived by his second wife and a daughter by his first wife. His property was divided between his wife and his daughter. In his will (dating from 1657), he left 25 guilders to the poor of his village, Lutjegast.

Although Tasman&#x27;s pilot, Frans Visscher, published &quot;Memoir concerning the discovery of the South land&quot; in 1642, Tasman&#x27;s detailed journal was not published until 1898. Nevertheless, some of his charts and maps were in general circulation and used by subsequent explorers. The journal signed by Abel Tasman of the 1642 voyage is held in the Dutch National Archives at The Hague.

==Legacy==
Tasman&#x27;s ten-month voyage in 1642–43 had significant consequences. By circumnavigating Australia (albeit at a distance) Tasman proved that the small fifth continent was not joined to any larger sixth continent, such as the long-imagined Southern Continent. Further, Tasman&#x27;s suggestion that New Zealand was the western side of that Southern Continent was seized upon by many European cartographers who, for the next century, depicted New Zealand as the west coast of a &quot;Terra Australis&quot; rising gradually from the waters around Tierra del Fuego. This theory was eventually disproved when Captain Cook circumnavigated New Zealand in 1769.

Multiple places have been named after Tasman, including:
*The Australian island and state of Tasmania, renamed after him, formerly Van Diemen&#x27;s land. It includes features such as:
**The Tasman Peninsula.
**The Tasman Bridge.
**The Tasman Highway.
*The Tasman Sea.
*In New Zealand:
**The Tasman Glacier.
**Tasman Lake.
**The Tasman River.
**Mount Tasman.
**The Abel Tasman National Park.
**Tasman Bay.
**The Tasman District.
**Abel Tasman Monument.
Also named after Tasman are:
*Tasman Pulp and Paper company, a large pulp and paper producer in Kawerau, New Zealand.
*Abel Tasman Drive, in Tākaka.
*The former passenger/vehicle ferry &quot;Abel Tasman.&quot;
*The Able Tasmans – an indie band from Auckland, New Zealand.
*Tasman, a layout engine for Internet Explorer.
* 6594 Tasman (1987 MM1), a main-belt asteroid.
* Tasman Drive in San Jose, California, and its Tasman light rail station, named after the Tasman Sea.
* Tasman Road in Claremont, Cape Town, South Africa.

* HMNZS Tasman, shore-based training establishment of the Royal New Zealand Navy.
* HMAS &quot;Tasman&quot; is a Hunter-class frigate that is expected to enter service with the Royal Australian Navy in the late 2020s.

His portrait has been on four New Zealand postage stamp issues, on a 1992 5 NZD coin, and on 1963, 1966 and 1985 Australian postage stamps.

In the Netherlands, many streets are named after him. In Lutjegast, the village where he was born, there is a museum dedicated to his life and travels.

Tasman&#x27;s life was dramatised for radio in &quot;Early in the Morning&quot; (1946) a play by Ruth Park.

===Portraits and depictions===

A drawing titled &quot;Abel Janssen Tasman, Navigateur en Australie&quot; is held by the State Library of New South Wales as part of &quot;a portfolio of 26 ink drawings of 16th and 17th century Dutch admirals, navigators and governor-generals of the VOC&quot;. The portfolio was acquired at an art auction in The Hague in 1862. However, it is unclear if the drawing is of Tasman and its original source is unknown, although it has been said to resemble the work of Dutch engraver Jacobus Houbraken. The drawing has been assessed as having the &quot;most reliable provenance&quot; of any depiction of Tasman with &quot;no strong reason to doubt that the drawing is not genuine&quot;.

In 1948, the National Library of Australia acquired from Rex Nan Kivell a portrait purporting to depict Tasman with his wife and stepdaughter, which was attributed to Jacob Gerritsz. Cuyp and dated to 1637. In 2018 the painting was exhibited by the Groninger Museum in the Netherlands which identified it as &quot;the only known portrait of the explorer&quot;. However, the Netherlands Institute for Art History has instead attributed the painting to Dirck van Santvoort and concluded that the painting does not depict Tasman and his family.

The provenance provided from Nan Kivell for the family portrait has been unable to be verified. Nan Kivell claimed that the portrait was passed down through the Springer family – relatives of Tasman&#x27;s widow – and was sold at Christie&#x27;s in 1877. However, Christie&#x27;s records indicate that the portrait was not owned by the Springer family or associated with Tasman, and was instead sold as &quot;Portrait of an astronomer&quot; by &quot;Anthonie Palamedes&quot; [sic]. Nan Kivell additionally claimed that the portrait was sold at Christie&#x27;s a second time in 1941, however no records exist to support this. A survey of portraits of Tasman published in 2019 concluded that the provenance was &quot;either invented by Rex Nan Kivell or by the unnamed art dealer who sold it to Rex Nan Kivell&quot;, and that the painting &quot;should therefore not be considered a portrait of Abel Tasman&#x27;s family&quot;.

Outside of the Nan Kivell painting, another purported portrait of Tasman was &quot;discovered&quot; in 1893 and eventually acquired by the Tasmanian government in 1976 for the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery (TMAG). The painting is unsigned and was attributed to Bartholomeus van der Helst at the time of its discovery, but this attribution was disputed by Dutch art historian Cornelis Hofstede de Groot and Alec Martin of Christie&#x27;s. In 1985, TMAG curator Dan Gregg stated that &quot;the painter of the life-sized portrait is unknown [...] there is some uncertainty as to whether the portrait is really of Tasman&quot;.

==Tasman map==

Held within the collection of the State Library of New South Wales is the Tasman map, thought to have been drawn by Isaac Gilsemans, or completed under the supervision of Franz Jacobszoon Visscher. The map is also known as the Bonaparte map, as it was once owned by Prince Roland Bonaparte, the great-nephew of Napoleon. The map was completed sometime after 1644 and is based on the original charts drawn during Tasman&#x27;s first and second voyages. As none of the journals or logs composed during Tasman&#x27;s second voyage have survived, the Bonaparte map remains an important contemporary artefact of Tasman&#x27;s voyage to the northern coast of the Australian continent.

The Tasman map reveals the extent of understanding the Dutch had of the Australian continent at the time. The map includes the western and southern coasts of Australia, accidentally encountered by Dutch voyagers as they journeyed by way of the Cape of Good Hope to the VOC headquarters in Batavia. In addition, the map shows the tracks of Tasman&#x27;s two voyages. Of his second voyage, the map shows the Banda Islands, the southern coast of New Guinea and much of the northern coast of Australia. However, the land areas adjacent to the Torres Strait are shown unexamined; this is despite Tasman having been given orders by VOC Council at Batavia to explore the possibility of a channel between New Guinea and the Australian continent.

There is debate as to the origin of the map. It is widely believed that the map was produced in Batavia; however, it has also been argued that the map was produced in Amsterdam. The authorship of the map has also been debated: while the map is commonly attributed to Tasman, it is now thought to have been the result of a collaboration, probably involving Franchoijs Visscher and Isaack Gilsemans, who took part in both of Tasman&#x27;s voyages. Whether the map was produced in 1644 is also subject to debate, as a VOC company report in December 1644 suggested that at that time no maps showing Tasman&#x27;s voyages were yet complete.

In 1943, a mosaic version of the map, composed of coloured brass and marble, was inlaid into the vestibule floor of the Mitchell Library in Sydney. The work was commissioned by the Principal Librarian William Ifould, and completed by the Melocco Brothers of Annandale, who also worked on the ANZAC War Memorial in Hyde Park and the crypt at St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, Sydney.

<doc id="1997" wikidata="Q180969" url="?curid=1997" title="Algebraic geometry">
<text>Algebraic geometry is a branch of mathematics which uses abstract algebraic techniques, mainly from commutative algebra, to solve geometrical problems. Classically, it studies zeros of multivariate polynomials; the modern approach generalizes this in a few different aspects.

The fundamental objects of study in algebraic geometry are algebraic varieties, which are geometric manifestations of solutions of systems of polynomial equations. Examples of the most studied classes of algebraic varieties are lines, circles, parabolas, ellipses, hyperbolas, cubic curves like elliptic curves, and quartic curves like lemniscates and Cassini ovals. These are plane algebraic curves. A point of the plane lies on an algebraic curve if its coordinates satisfy a given polynomial equation. Basic questions involve the study of points of special interest like singular points, inflection points and points at infinity. More advanced questions involve the topology of the curve and the relationship between curves defined by different equations.

Algebraic geometry occupies a central place in modern mathematics and has multiple conceptual connections with such diverse fields as complex analysis, topology and number theory. As a study of systems of polynomial equations in several variables, the subject of algebraic geometry begins with finding specific solutions via equation solving, and then proceeds to understand the intrinsic properties of the totality of solutions of a system of equations. This understanding requires both conceptual theory and computational technique.
In the 20th century, algebraic geometry split into several subareas.
* The mainstream of algebraic geometry is devoted to the study of the complex points of the algebraic varieties and more generally to the points with coordinates in an algebraically closed field.
* Real algebraic geometry is the study of the real algebraic varieties.
* Diophantine geometry and, more generally, arithmetic geometry is the study of algebraic varieties over fields that are not algebraically closed and, specifically, over fields of interest in algebraic number theory, such as the field of rational numbers, number fields, finite fields, function fields, and &quot;p&quot;-adic fields.
* A large part of singularity theory is devoted to the singularities of algebraic varieties.
* Computational algebraic geometry is an area that has emerged at the intersection of algebraic geometry and computer algebra, with the rise of computers. It consists mainly of algorithm design and software development for the study of properties of explicitly given algebraic varieties.

Much of the development of the mainstream of algebraic geometry in the 20th century occurred within an abstract algebraic framework, with increasing emphasis being placed on &quot;intrinsic&quot; properties of algebraic varieties not dependent on any particular way of embedding the variety in an ambient coordinate space; this parallels developments in topology, differential and complex geometry. One key achievement of this abstract algebraic geometry is Grothendieck&#x27;s scheme theory which allows one to use sheaf theory to study algebraic varieties in a way which is very similar to its use in the study of differential and analytic manifolds. This is obtained by extending the notion of point: In classical algebraic geometry, a point of an affine variety may be identified, through Hilbert&#x27;s Nullstellensatz, with a maximal ideal of the coordinate ring, while the points of the corresponding affine scheme are all prime ideals of this ring. This means that a point of such a scheme may be either a usual point or a subvariety. This approach also enables a unification of the language and the tools of classical algebraic geometry, mainly concerned with complex points, and of algebraic number theory. Wiles&#x27; proof of the longstanding conjecture called Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem is an example of the power of this approach.

==Basic notions==
=== Zeros of simultaneous polynomials ===

In classical algebraic geometry, the main objects of interest are the vanishing sets of collections of polynomials, meaning the set of all points that simultaneously satisfy one or more polynomial equations. For instance, the two-dimensional sphere of radius 1 in three-dimensional Euclidean space R3 could be defined as the set of all points formula_1 with

:formula_2

A &quot;slanted&quot; circle in R3 can be defined as the set of all points formula_1 which satisfy the two polynomial equations

:formula_4
:formula_5

=== Affine varieties ===
First we start with a field &quot;k&quot;. In classical algebraic geometry, this field was always the complex numbers C, but many of the same results are true if we assume only that &quot;k&quot; is algebraically closed. We consider the affine space of dimension &quot;n&quot; over &quot;k&quot;, denoted An(&quot;k&quot;) (or more simply A&quot;n&quot;, when &quot;k&quot; is clear from the context). When one fixes a coordinate system, one may identify An(&quot;k&quot;) with &quot;k&quot;&quot;n&quot;. The purpose of not working with &quot;k&quot;&quot;n&quot; is to emphasize that one &quot;forgets&quot; the vector space structure that &quot;k&quot;n carries.

A function &quot;f&quot; : A&quot;n&quot; → A1 is said to be &quot;polynomial&quot; (or &quot;regular&quot;) if it can be written as a polynomial, that is, if there is a polynomial &quot;p&quot; in &quot;k&quot;[&quot;x&quot;1...,&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;] such that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;M&quot;) = &quot;p&quot;(&quot;t&quot;1...,&quot;t&quot;&quot;n&quot;) for every point &quot;M&quot; with coordinates (&quot;t&quot;1...,&quot;t&quot;&quot;n&quot;) in A&quot;n&quot;. The property of a function to be polynomial (or regular) does not depend on the choice of a coordinate system in A&quot;n&quot;.

When a coordinate system is chosen, the regular functions on the affine &quot;n&quot;-space may be identified with the ring of polynomial functions in &quot;n&quot; variables over &quot;k&quot;. Therefore, the set of the regular functions on A&quot;n&quot; is a ring, which is denoted &quot;k&quot;[A&quot;n&quot;].

We say that a polynomial &quot;vanishes&quot; at a point if evaluating it at that point gives zero. Let &quot;S&quot; be a set of polynomials in &quot;k&quot;[An]. The &quot;vanishing set of S&quot; (or &quot;vanishing locus&quot; or &quot;zero set&quot;) is the set &quot;V&quot;(&quot;S&quot;) of all points in A&quot;n&quot; where every polynomial in &quot;S&quot; vanishes. Symbolically,

:formula_6

A subset of A&quot;n&quot; which is &quot;V&quot;(&quot;S&quot;), for some &quot;S&quot;, is called an &quot;algebraic set&quot;. The &quot;V&quot; stands for &quot;variety&quot; (a specific type of algebraic set to be defined below).

Given a subset &quot;U&quot; of A&quot;n&quot;, can one recover the set of polynomials which generate it? If &quot;U&quot; is &quot;any&quot; subset of A&quot;n&quot;, define &quot;I&quot;(&quot;U&quot;) to be the set of all polynomials whose vanishing set contains &quot;U&quot;. The &quot;I&quot; stands for ideal: if two polynomials &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; both vanish on &quot;U&quot;, then &quot;f&quot;+&quot;g&quot; vanishes on &quot;U&quot;, and if &quot;h&quot; is any polynomial, then &quot;hf&quot; vanishes on &quot;U&quot;, so &quot;I&quot;(&quot;U&quot;) is always an ideal of the polynomial ring &quot;k&quot;[A&quot;n&quot;].

Two natural questions to ask are:
* Given a subset &quot;U&quot; of A&quot;n&quot;, when is &quot;U&quot; = &quot;V&quot;(&quot;I&quot;(&quot;U&quot;))?
* Given a set &quot;S&quot; of polynomials, when is &quot;S&quot; = &quot;I&quot;(&quot;V&quot;(&quot;S&quot;))?

The answer to the first question is provided by introducing the Zariski topology, a topology on A&quot;n&quot; whose closed sets are the algebraic sets, and which directly reflects the algebraic structure of &quot;k&quot;[A&quot;n&quot;]. Then &quot;U&quot; = &quot;V&quot;(&quot;I&quot;(&quot;U&quot;)) if and only if &quot;U&quot; is an algebraic set or equivalently a Zariski-closed set. The answer to the second question is given by Hilbert&#x27;s Nullstellensatz. In one of its forms, it says that &quot;I&quot;(&quot;V&quot;(&quot;S&quot;)) is the radical of the ideal generated by &quot;S&quot;. In more abstract language, there is a Galois connection, giving rise to two closure operators; they can be identified, and naturally play a basic role in the theory; the example is elaborated at Galois connection.

For various reasons we may not always want to work with the entire ideal corresponding to an algebraic set &quot;U&quot;. Hilbert&#x27;s basis theorem implies that ideals in &quot;k&quot;[A&quot;n&quot;] are always finitely generated.

An algebraic set is called &quot;irreducible&quot; if it cannot be written as the union of two smaller algebraic sets. Any algebraic set is a finite union of irreducible algebraic sets and this decomposition is unique. Thus its elements are called the &quot;irreducible components&quot; of the algebraic set. An irreducible algebraic set is also called a &quot;variety&quot;. It turns out that an algebraic set is a variety if and only if it may be defined as the vanishing set of a prime ideal of the polynomial ring.

Some authors do not make a clear distinction between algebraic sets and varieties and use &quot;irreducible variety&quot; to make the distinction when needed.

=== Regular functions ===
Just as continuous functions are the natural maps on topological spaces and smooth functions are the natural maps on differentiable manifolds, there is a natural class of functions on an algebraic set, called &quot;regular functions&quot; or &quot;polynomial functions&quot;. A regular function on an algebraic set &quot;V&quot; contained in A&quot;n&quot; is the restriction to &quot;V&quot; of a regular function on A&quot;n&quot;. For an algebraic set defined on the field of the complex numbers, the regular functions are smooth and even analytic.

It may seem unnaturally restrictive to require that a regular function always extend to the ambient space, but it is very similar to the situation in a normal topological space, where the Tietze extension theorem guarantees that a continuous function on a closed subset always extends to the ambient topological space.

Just as with the regular functions on affine space, the regular functions on &quot;V&quot; form a ring, which we denote by &quot;k&quot;[&quot;V&quot;]. This ring is called the &quot;coordinate ring of V&quot;.

Since regular functions on V come from regular functions on A&quot;n&quot;, there is a relationship between the coordinate rings. Specifically, if a regular function on &quot;V&quot; is the restriction of two functions &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; in &quot;k&quot;[A&quot;n&quot;], then &quot;f&quot; − &quot;g&quot; is a polynomial function which is null on &quot;V&quot; and thus belongs to &quot;I&quot;(&quot;V&quot;). Thus &quot;k&quot;[&quot;V&quot;] may be identified with &quot;k&quot;[A&quot;n&quot;]/&quot;I&quot;(&quot;V&quot;).

=== Morphism of affine varieties ===
Using regular functions from an affine variety to A1, we can define regular maps from one affine variety to another. First we will define a regular map from a variety into affine space: Let &quot;V&quot; be a variety contained in A&quot;n&quot;. Choose &quot;m&quot; regular functions on &quot;V&quot;, and call them &quot;f&quot;1, ..., &quot;f&quot;&quot;m&quot;. We define a &quot;regular map&quot; &quot;f&quot; from &quot;V&quot; to A&quot;m&quot; by letting . In other words, each &quot;f&quot;&quot;i&quot; determines one coordinate of the range of &quot;f&quot;.

If &quot;V&quot;′ is a variety contained in A&quot;m&quot;, we say that &quot;f&quot; is a &quot;regular map&quot; from &quot;V&quot; to &quot;V&quot;′ if the range of &quot;f&quot; is contained in &quot;V&quot;′.

The definition of the regular maps apply also to algebraic sets.
The regular maps are also called &quot;morphisms&quot;, as they make the collection of all affine algebraic sets into a category, where the objects are the affine algebraic sets and the morphisms are the regular maps. The affine varieties is a subcategory of the category of the algebraic sets.

Given a regular map &quot;g&quot; from &quot;V&quot; to &quot;V&quot;′ and a regular function &quot;f&quot; of &quot;k&quot;[&quot;V&quot;′], then . The map is a ring homomorphism from &quot;k&quot;[&quot;V&quot;′] to &quot;k&quot;[&quot;V&quot;]. Conversely, every ring homomorphism from &quot;k&quot;[&quot;V&quot;′] to &quot;k&quot;[&quot;V&quot;] defines a regular map from &quot;V&quot; to &quot;V&quot;′. This defines an equivalence of categories between the category of algebraic sets and the opposite category of the finitely generated reduced &quot;k&quot;-algebras. This equivalence is one of the starting points of scheme theory.

=== Rational function and birational equivalence ===

In contrast to the preceding sections, this section concerns only varieties and not algebraic sets. On the other hand, the definitions extend naturally to projective varieties (next section), as an affine variety and its projective completion have the same field of functions.

If &quot;V&quot; is an affine variety, its coordinate ring is an integral domain and has thus a field of fractions which is denoted &quot;k&quot;(&quot;V&quot;) and called the &quot;field of the rational functions&quot; on &quot;V&quot; or, shortly, the &quot;function field&quot; of &quot;V&quot;. Its elements are the restrictions to &quot;V&quot; of the rational functions over the affine space containing &quot;V&quot;. The domain of a rational function &quot;f&quot; is not &quot;V&quot; but the complement of the subvariety (a hypersurface) where the denominator of &quot;f&quot; vanishes.

As with regular maps, one may define a &quot;rational map&quot; from a variety &quot;V&quot; to a variety &quot;V&quot;&#x27;. As with the regular maps, the rational maps from &quot;V&quot; to &quot;V&quot;&#x27; may be identified to the field homomorphisms from &quot;k&quot;(&quot;V&quot;&#x27;) to &quot;k&quot;(&quot;V&quot;).

Two affine varieties are &quot;birationally equivalent&quot; if there are two rational functions between them which are inverse one to the other in the regions where both are defined. Equivalently, they are birationally equivalent if their function fields are isomorphic.

An affine variety is a &quot;rational variety&quot; if it is birationally equivalent to an affine space. This means that the variety admits a &quot;rational parameterization&quot;, that is a parametrization with rational functions. For example, the circle of equation formula_7 is a rational curve, as it has the parametric equation
:formula_8
:formula_9
which may also be viewed as a rational map from the line to the circle.

The problem of resolution of singularities is to know if every algebraic variety is birationally equivalent to a variety whose projective completion is nonsingular (see also smooth completion). It was solved in the affirmative in characteristic 0 by Heisuke Hironaka in 1964 and is yet unsolved in finite characteristic.

=== Projective variety ===

Just as the formulas for the roots of second, third, and fourth degree polynomials suggest extending real numbers to the more algebraically complete setting of the complex numbers, many properties of algebraic varieties suggest extending affine space to a more geometrically complete projective space. Whereas the complex numbers are obtained by adding the number &quot;i&quot;, a root of the polynomial , projective space is obtained by adding in appropriate points &quot;at infinity&quot;, points where parallel lines may meet.

To see how this might come about, consider the variety . If we draw it, we get a parabola. As &quot;x&quot; goes to positive infinity, the slope of the line from the origin to the point (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;x&quot;2) also goes to positive infinity. As &quot;x&quot; goes to negative infinity, the slope of the same line goes to negative infinity.

Compare this to the variety &quot;V&quot;(&quot;y&quot; − &quot;x&quot;3). This is a cubic curve. As &quot;x&quot; goes to positive infinity, the slope of the line from the origin to the point (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;x&quot;3) goes to positive infinity just as before. But unlike before, as &quot;x&quot; goes to negative infinity, the slope of the same line goes to positive infinity as well; the exact opposite of the parabola. So the behavior &quot;at infinity&quot; of &quot;V&quot;(&quot;y&quot; − &quot;x&quot;3) is different from the behavior &quot;at infinity&quot; of &quot;V&quot;(&quot;y&quot; − &quot;x&quot;2).

The consideration of the &quot;projective completion&quot; of the two curves, which is their prolongation &quot;at infinity&quot; in the projective plane, allows us to quantify this difference: the point at infinity of the parabola is a regular point, whose tangent is the line at infinity, while the point at infinity of the cubic curve is a cusp. Also, both curves are rational, as they are parameterized by &quot;x&quot;, and the Riemann-Roch theorem implies that the cubic curve must have a singularity, which must be at infinity, as all its points in the affine space are regular.

Thus many of the properties of algebraic varieties, including birational equivalence and all the topological properties, depend on the behavior &quot;at infinity&quot; and so it is natural to study the varieties in projective space. Furthermore, the introduction of projective techniques made many theorems in algebraic geometry simpler and sharper: For example, Bézout&#x27;s theorem on the number of intersection points between two varieties can be stated in its sharpest form only in projective space. For these reasons, projective space plays a fundamental role in algebraic geometry.

Nowadays, the &quot;projective space&quot; P&quot;n&quot; of dimension &quot;n&quot; is usually defined as the set of the lines passing through a point, considered as the origin, in the affine space of dimension , or equivalently to the set of the vector lines in a vector space of dimension . When a coordinate system has been chosen in the space of dimension , all the points of a line have the same set of coordinates, up to the multiplication by an element of &quot;k&quot;. This defines the homogeneous coordinates of a point of P&quot;n&quot; as a sequence of elements of the base field &quot;k&quot;, defined up to the multiplication by a nonzero element of &quot;k&quot; (the same for the whole sequence).

A polynomial in variables vanishes at all points of a line passing through the origin if and only if it is homogeneous. In this case, one says that the polynomial &quot;vanishes&quot; at the corresponding point of P&quot;n&quot;. This allows us to define a &quot;projective algebraic set&quot; in P&quot;n&quot; as the set , where a finite set of homogeneous polynomials vanishes. Like for affine algebraic sets, there is a bijection between the projective algebraic sets and the reduced homogeneous ideals which define them. The &quot;projective varieties&quot; are the projective algebraic sets whose defining ideal is prime. In other words, a projective variety is a projective algebraic set, whose homogeneous coordinate ring is an integral domain, the &quot;projective coordinates ring&quot; being defined as the quotient of the graded ring or the polynomials in variables by the homogeneous (reduced) ideal defining the variety. Every projective algebraic set may be uniquely decomposed into a finite union of projective varieties.

The only regular functions which may be defined properly on a projective variety are the constant functions. Thus this notion is not used in projective situations. On the other hand, the &quot;field of the rational functions&quot; or &quot;function field &quot; is a useful notion, which, similarly to the affine case, is defined as the set of the quotients of two homogeneous elements of the same degree in the homogeneous coordinate ring.

==Real algebraic geometry==
Real algebraic geometry is the study of real algebraic varieties.

The fact that the field of the real numbers is an ordered field cannot be ignored in such a study. For example, the curve of equation formula_10 is a circle if formula_11, but has no real points if formula_12. Real algebraic geometry also investigates, more broadly, &quot;semi-algebraic sets&quot;, which are the solutions of systems of polynomial inequalities. For example, neither branch of the hyperbola of equation formula_13 is a real algebraic variety. However, the branch in the first quadrant is a semi-algebraic set defined by formula_14 and formula_15.

One open problem in real algebraic geometry is the following part of Hilbert&#x27;s sixteenth problem: Decide which respective positions are possible for the ovals of a nonsingular plane curve of degree 8.

== Computational algebraic geometry ==
One may date the origin of computational algebraic geometry to meeting EUROSAM&#x27;79 (International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Manipulation) held at Marseille, France, in June 1979. At this meeting,
* Dennis S. Arnon showed that George E. Collins&#x27;s Cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD) allows the computation of the topology of semi-algebraic sets,
* Bruno Buchberger presented Gröbner bases and his algorithm to compute them,
* Daniel Lazard presented a new algorithm for solving systems of homogeneous polynomial equations with a computational complexity which is essentially polynomial in the expected number of solutions and thus simply exponential in the number of the unknowns. This algorithm is strongly related with Macaulay&#x27;s multivariate resultant.

Since then, most results in this area are related to one or several of these items either by using or improving one of these algorithms, or by finding algorithms whose complexity is simply exponential in the number of the variables.

A body of mathematical theory complementary to symbolic methods called numerical algebraic geometry has been developed over the last several decades. The main computational method is homotopy continuation. This supports, for example, a model of floating point computation for solving problems of algebraic geometry.

===Gröbner basis===

A Gröbner basis is a system of generators of a polynomial ideal whose computation allows the deduction of many properties of the affine algebraic variety defined by the ideal.

Given an ideal &quot;I&quot; defining an algebraic set &quot;V&quot;:
* &quot;V&quot; is empty (over an algebraically closed extension of the basis field), if and only if the Gröbner basis for any monomial ordering is reduced to {1}.
* By means of the Hilbert series one may compute the dimension and the degree of &quot;V&quot; from any Gröbner basis of &quot;I&quot; for a monomial ordering refining the total degree.
* If the dimension of &quot;V&quot; is 0, one may compute the points (finite in number) of &quot;V&quot; from any Gröbner basis of &quot;I&quot; (see Systems of polynomial equations).
* A Gröbner basis computation allows one to remove from &quot;V&quot; all irreducible components which are contained in a given hypersurface.
* A Gröbner basis computation allows one to compute the Zariski closure of the image of &quot;V&quot; by the projection on the &quot;k&quot; first coordinates, and the subset of the image where the projection is not proper.
* More generally Gröbner basis computations allow one to compute the Zariski closure of the image and the critical points of a rational function of &quot;V&quot; into another affine variety.

Gröbner basis computations do not allow one to compute directly the primary decomposition of &quot;I&quot; nor the prime ideals defining the irreducible components of &quot;V&quot;, but most algorithms for this involve Gröbner basis computation. The algorithms which are not based on Gröbner bases use regular chains but may need Gröbner bases in some exceptional situations.

Gröbner bases are deemed to be difficult to compute. In fact they may contain, in the worst case, polynomials whose degree is doubly exponential in the number of variables and a number of polynomials which is also doubly exponential. However, this is only a worst case complexity, and the complexity bound of Lazard&#x27;s algorithm of 1979 may frequently apply. Faugère F5 algorithm realizes this complexity, as it may be viewed as an improvement of Lazard&#x27;s 1979 algorithm. It follows that the best implementations allow one to compute almost routinely with algebraic sets of degree more than 100. This means that, presently, the difficulty of computing a Gröbner basis is strongly related to the intrinsic difficulty of the problem.

===Cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD)===
CAD is an algorithm which was introduced in 1973 by G. Collins to implement with an acceptable complexity the Tarski–Seidenberg theorem on quantifier elimination over the real numbers.

This theorem concerns the formulas of the first-order logic whose atomic formulas are polynomial equalities or inequalities between polynomials with real coefficients. These formulas are thus the formulas which may be constructed from the atomic formulas by the logical operators &quot;and&quot; (∧), &quot;or&quot; (∨), &quot;not&quot; (¬), &quot;for all&quot; (∀) and &quot;exists&quot; (∃). Tarski&#x27;s theorem asserts that, from such a formula, one may compute an equivalent formula without quantifier (∀, ∃).

The complexity of CAD is doubly exponential in the number of variables. This means that CAD allows, in theory, to solve every problem of real algebraic geometry which may be expressed by such a formula, that is almost every problem concerning explicitly given varieties and semi-algebraic sets.

While Gröbner basis computation has doubly exponential complexity only in rare cases, CAD has almost always this high complexity. This implies that, unless if most polynomials appearing in the input are linear, it may not solve problems with more than four variables.

Since 1973, most of the research on this subject is devoted either to improving CAD or finding alternative algorithms in special cases of general interest.

As an example of the state of art, there are efficient algorithms to find at least a point in every connected component of a semi-algebraic set, and thus to test if a semi-algebraic set is empty. On the other hand, CAD is yet, in practice, the best algorithm to count the number of connected components.

=== Asymptotic complexity vs. practical efficiency ===
The basic general algorithms of computational geometry have a double exponential worst case complexity. More precisely, if &quot;d&quot; is the maximal degree of the input polynomials and &quot;n&quot; the number of variables, their complexity is at most formula_16 for some constant &quot;c&quot;, and, for some inputs, the complexity is at least formula_17 for another constant &quot;c&quot;′.

During the last 20 years of the 20th century, various algorithms have been introduced to solve specific subproblems with a better complexity. Most of these algorithms have a complexity formula_18.

Among these algorithms which solve a sub problem of the problems solved by Gröbner bases, one may cite &quot;testing if an affine variety is empty&quot; and &quot;solving nonhomogeneous polynomial systems which have a finite number of solutions.&quot; Such algorithms are rarely implemented because, on most entries Faugère&#x27;s F4 and F5 algorithms have a better practical efficiency and probably a similar or better complexity (&quot;probably&quot; because the evaluation of the complexity of Gröbner basis algorithms on a particular class of entries is a difficult task which has been done only in a few special cases).

The main algorithms of real algebraic geometry which solve a problem solved by CAD are related to the topology of semi-algebraic sets. One may cite &quot;counting the number of connected components&quot;, &quot;testing if two points are in the same components&quot; or &quot;computing a Whitney stratification of a real algebraic set&quot;. They have a complexity of
formula_18, but the constant involved by &quot;O&quot; notation is so high that using them to solve any nontrivial problem effectively solved by CAD, is impossible even if one could use all the existing computing power in the world. Therefore, these algorithms have never been implemented and this is an active research area to search for algorithms with have together a good asymptotic complexity and a good practical efficiency.

== Abstract modern viewpoint ==
The modern approaches to algebraic geometry redefine and effectively extend the range of basic objects in various levels of generality to schemes, formal schemes, ind-schemes, algebraic spaces, algebraic stacks and so on. The need for this arises already from the useful ideas within theory of varieties, e.g. the formal functions of Zariski can be accommodated by introducing nilpotent elements in structure rings; considering spaces of loops and arcs, constructing quotients by group actions and developing formal grounds for natural intersection theory and deformation theory lead to some of the further extensions.

Most remarkably, in the early 1960s, algebraic varieties were subsumed into Alexander Grothendieck&#x27;s concept of a scheme. Their local objects are affine schemes or prime spectra which are locally ringed spaces which form a category which is antiequivalent to the category of commutative unital rings, extending the duality between the category of affine algebraic varieties over a field &quot;k&quot;, and the category of finitely generated reduced &quot;k&quot;-algebras. The gluing is along Zariski topology; one can glue within the category of locally ringed spaces, but also, using the Yoneda embedding, within the more abstract category of presheaves of sets over the category of affine schemes. The Zariski topology in the set theoretic sense is then replaced by a Grothendieck topology. Grothendieck introduced Grothendieck topologies having in mind more exotic but geometrically finer and more sensitive examples than the crude Zariski topology, namely the étale topology, and the two flat Grothendieck topologies: fppf and fpqc; nowadays some other examples became prominent including Nisnevich topology. Sheaves can be furthermore generalized to stacks in the sense of Grothendieck, usually with some additional representability conditions leading to Artin stacks and, even finer, Deligne–Mumford stacks, both often called algebraic stacks.

Sometimes other algebraic sites replace the category of affine schemes. For example, Nikolai Durov has introduced commutative algebraic monads as a generalization of local objects in a generalized algebraic geometry. Versions of a tropical geometry, of an absolute geometry over a field of one element and an algebraic analogue of Arakelov&#x27;s geometry were realized in this setup.

Another formal generalization is possible to universal algebraic geometry in which every variety of algebras has its own algebraic geometry. The term &quot;variety of algebras&quot; should not be confused with &quot;algebraic variety&quot;.

The language of schemes, stacks and generalizations has proved to be a valuable way of dealing with geometric concepts and became cornerstones of modern algebraic geometry.

Algebraic stacks can be further generalized and for many practical questions like deformation theory and intersection theory, this is often the most natural approach. One can extend the Grothendieck site of affine schemes to a higher categorical site of derived affine schemes, by replacing the commutative rings with an infinity category of differential graded commutative algebras, or of simplicial commutative rings or a similar category with an appropriate variant of a Grothendieck topology. One can also replace presheaves of sets by presheaves of simplicial sets (or of infinity groupoids). Then, in presence of an appropriate homotopic machinery one can develop a notion of derived stack as such a presheaf on the infinity category of derived affine schemes, which is satisfying certain infinite categorical version of a sheaf axiom (and to be algebraic, inductively a sequence of representability conditions). Quillen model categories, Segal categories and quasicategories are some of the most often used tools to formalize this yielding the &quot;derived algebraic geometry&quot;, introduced by the school of Carlos Simpson, including Andre Hirschowitz, Bertrand Toën, Gabrielle Vezzosi, Michel Vaquié and others; and developed further by Jacob Lurie, Bertrand Toën, and Gabriele Vezzosi. Another (noncommutative) version of derived algebraic geometry, using A-infinity categories has been developed from the early 1990s by Maxim Kontsevich and followers.

== History ==

===Before the 16th century===
Some of the roots of algebraic geometry date back to the work of the Hellenistic Greeks from the 5th century BC. The Delian problem, for instance, was to construct a length &quot;x&quot; so that the cube of side &quot;x&quot; contained the same volume as the rectangular box &quot;a&quot;2&quot;b&quot; for given sides &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;. Menaechmus () considered the problem geometrically by intersecting the pair of plane conics &quot;ay&quot; = &quot;x&quot;2 and &quot;xy&quot; = &quot;ab&quot;. In the 3rd century BC, Archimedes and Apollonius systematically studied additional problems on conic sections using coordinates. Apollonius in the Conics further developed a method that is so similar to analytic geometry that his work is sometimes thought to have anticipated the work of Descartes by some 1800 years. His application of reference lines, a diameter and a tangent is essentially no different from our modern use of a coordinate frame, where the distances measured along the diameter from the point of tangency are the abscissas, and the segments parallel to the tangent and intercepted between the axis and the curve are the ordinates. He further developed relations between the abscissas and the corresponding coordinates using geometric methods like using parabolas and curves. Medieval mathematicians, including Omar Khayyam, Leonardo of Pisa, Gersonides and Nicole Oresme in the Medieval Period, solved certain cubic and quadratic equations by purely algebraic means and then interpreted the results geometrically. The Persian mathematician Omar Khayyám (born 1048 AD) believed that there was a relationship between arithmetic, algebra and geometry. This was criticized by Jeffrey Oaks, who claims that the study of curves by means of equations originated with Descartes in the seventeenth century.

===Renaissance===

Such techniques of applying geometrical constructions to algebraic problems were also adopted by a number of Renaissance mathematicians such as Gerolamo Cardano and Niccolò Fontana &quot;Tartaglia&quot; on their studies of the cubic equation. The geometrical approach to construction problems, rather than the algebraic one, was favored by most 16th and 17th century mathematicians, notably Blaise Pascal who argued against the use of algebraic and analytical methods in geometry. The French mathematicians Franciscus Vieta and later René Descartes and Pierre de Fermat revolutionized the conventional way of thinking about construction problems through the introduction of coordinate geometry. They were interested primarily in the properties of &quot;algebraic curves&quot;, such as those defined by Diophantine equations (in the case of Fermat), and the algebraic reformulation of the classical Greek works on conics and cubics (in the case of Descartes).

During the same period, Blaise Pascal and Gérard Desargues approached geometry from a different perspective, developing the synthetic notions of projective geometry. Pascal and Desargues also studied curves, but from the purely geometrical point of view: the analog of the Greek &quot;ruler and compass construction&quot;. Ultimately, the analytic geometry of Descartes and Fermat won out, for it supplied the 18th century mathematicians with concrete quantitative tools needed to study physical problems using the new calculus of Newton and Leibniz. However, by the end of the 18th century, most of the algebraic character of coordinate geometry was subsumed by the &quot;calculus of infinitesimals&quot; of Lagrange and Euler.

===19th and early 20th century===
It took the simultaneous 19th century developments of non-Euclidean geometry and Abelian integrals in order to bring the old algebraic ideas back into the geometrical fold. The first of these new developments was seized up by Edmond Laguerre and Arthur Cayley, who attempted to ascertain the generalized metric properties of projective space. Cayley introduced the idea of &quot;homogeneous polynomial forms&quot;, and more specifically quadratic forms, on projective space. Subsequently, Felix Klein studied projective geometry (along with other types of geometry) from the viewpoint that the geometry on a space is encoded in a certain class of transformations on the space. By the end of the 19th century, projective geometers were studying more general kinds of transformations on figures in projective space. Rather than the projective linear transformations which were normally regarded as giving the fundamental Kleinian geometry on projective space, they concerned themselves also with the higher degree birational transformations. This weaker notion of congruence would later lead members of the 20th century Italian school of algebraic geometry to classify algebraic surfaces up to birational isomorphism.

The second early 19th century development, that of Abelian integrals, would lead Bernhard Riemann to the development of Riemann surfaces.

In the same period began the algebraization of the algebraic geometry through commutative algebra. The prominent results in this direction are Hilbert&#x27;s basis theorem and Hilbert&#x27;s Nullstellensatz, which are the basis of the connection between algebraic geometry and commutative algebra, and Macaulay&#x27;s multivariate resultant, which is the basis of elimination theory. Probably because of the size of the computation which is implied by multivariate resultants, elimination theory was forgotten during the middle of the 20th century until it was renewed by singularity theory and computational algebraic geometry.

===20th century===
B. L. van der Waerden, Oscar Zariski and André Weil developed a foundation for algebraic geometry based on contemporary commutative algebra, including valuation theory and the theory of ideals. One of the goals was to give a rigorous framework for proving the results of the Italian school of algebraic geometry. In particular, this school used systematically the notion of generic point without any precise definition, which was first given by these authors during the 1930s.

In the 1950s and 1960s, Jean-Pierre Serre and Alexander Grothendieck recast the foundations making use of sheaf theory. Later, from about 1960, and largely led by Grothendieck, the idea of schemes was worked out, in conjunction with a very refined apparatus of homological techniques. After a decade of rapid development the field stabilized in the 1970s, and new applications were made, both to number theory and to more classical geometric questions on algebraic varieties, singularities, moduli, and formal moduli.

An important class of varieties, not easily understood directly from their defining equations, are the abelian varieties, which are the projective varieties whose points form an abelian group. The prototypical examples are the elliptic curves, which have a rich theory. They were instrumental in the proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem and are also used in elliptic-curve cryptography.

In parallel with the abstract trend of the algebraic geometry, which is concerned with general statements about varieties, methods for effective computation with concretely-given varieties have also been developed, which lead to the new area of computational algebraic geometry. One of the founding methods of this area is the theory of Gröbner bases, introduced by Bruno Buchberger in 1965. Another founding method, more specially devoted to real algebraic geometry, is the cylindrical algebraic decomposition, introduced by George E. Collins in 1973.

==Analytic geometry==
An analytic variety over the field of real or complex numbers is defined locally as the set of common solutions of several equations involving analytic functions. It is analogous to the concept of algebraic variety in that it carries a structure sheaf of analytic functions instead of regular functions. Any complex manifold is a complex analytic variety. Since analytic varieties may have singular points, not all complex analytic varieties are manifolds. Over a non-archimedean field analytic geometry is studied via rigid analytic spaces.

Modern analytic geometry over the field of complex numbers is closely related to complex algebraic geometry, as has been shown by Jean-Pierre Serre in his paper &quot;GAGA&quot;, the name of which is French for &quot;Algebraic geometry and analytic geometry&quot;. The GAGA results over the field of complex numbers may be extended to rigid analytic spaces over non-archimedean fields.

==Applications==
Algebraic geometry now finds applications in statistics, control theory, robotics, error-correcting codes, phylogenetics and geometric modelling. There are also connections to string theory, game theory, graph matchings, solitons and integer programming.

<doc id="1998" wikidata="Q16559" url="?curid=1998" title="Austin, Texas">
<text>Austin ( ) is the capital city of the U.S. state of Texas. It is the seat and most populous city of Travis County, with portions extending into Hays and Williamson counties. Incorporated on December 27, 1839, it is the 26th-largest metropolitan area in the United States, the 12th-most populous city in the United States, the fourth-most populous city in the state after Houston, San Antonio, and Dallas, and the second-most populous state capital city after Phoenix, the capital of Arizona. It has been one of the fastest growing large cities in the United States since 2010. Downtown Austin and Downtown San Antonio are approximately apart, and both fall along the I-35 corridor. This combined metropolitan region of San Antonio–Austin has approximately 5 million people. Austin is the southernmost state capital in the contiguous United States and is considered a Gamma + level global city as categorized by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.

As of the 2020 census, Austin had a population of 961,855. The city is the cultural and economic center of the metropolitan statistical area, which had an estimated population of 2,473,275 as of July 1, 2023. Located in within the greater Texas Hill Country, it is home to numerous lakes, rivers, and waterways, including Lady Bird Lake and Lake Travis on the Colorado River, Barton Springs, McKinney Falls, and Lake Walter E. Long.

Residents of Austin are known as Austinites. They include a diverse mix of government employees, college students, musicians, high-tech workers, and blue-collar workers. The city&#x27;s official slogan promotes Austin as &quot;The Live Music Capital of the World&quot;, a reference to the city&#x27;s many musicians and live music venues, as well as the long-running PBS TV concert series &quot;Austin City Limits&quot;. Austin is the site of South by Southwest (SXSW), an annual conglomeration of parallel film, interactive media, and music festivals. The city also adopted &quot;Silicon Hills&quot; as a nickname in the 1990s due to a rapid influx of technology and development companies. In recent years, some Austinites have adopted the unofficial slogan &quot;Keep Austin Weird&quot;, which refers to the desire to protect small, unique, and local businesses from being overrun by large corporations. Since the late 19th century, Austin has also been known as the &quot;City of the Violet Crown&quot;, because of the colorful glow of light across the hills just after sunset.

Emerging from a strong economic focus on government and education, since the 1990s, Austin has become a center for technology and business. The technology roots in Austin can be traced back to the 1960s, when defense electronics contractor Tracor (now BAE Systems) began operations in the city in 1962. IBM followed in 1967, opening a facility to produce its Selectric typewriters. Texas Instruments was set up in Austin two years later, and Motorola (now NXP Semiconductors) started semiconductor chip manufacturing in 1974. A number of Fortune 500 companies have headquarters or regional offices in Austin, including 3M, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Agilent Technologies, Amazon, Apple, Dell, Expedia, Facebook (Meta), General Motors, Google, IBM, Intel, NXP Semiconductors, Oracle, Tesla, and Texas Instruments. With regard to education, Austin is the home of the University of Texas at Austin, one of the largest universities in the U.S., with over 50,000 students. In 2021, Austin became home to the Austin FC, the first (and currently only) major professional sports team in the city.

==History==
Austin, Travis County and Williamson County have been the site of human habitation since at least 9200 BC. The area&#x27;s earliest known inhabitants lived during the late Pleistocene (Ice Age) and are linked to the Clovis culture around 9200 BC (over 11,200 years ago), based on evidence found throughout the area and documented at the much-studied Gault Site, midway between Georgetown and Fort Cavazos.

When settlers arrived from Europe, the Tonkawa tribe inhabited the area. The Comanches and Lipan Apaches were also known to travel through the area. Spanish colonists, including the Espinosa-Olivares-Aguirre expedition, traveled through the area, though few permanent settlements were created for some time. In 1730, three Catholic missions from East Texas were combined and reestablished as one mission on the south side of the Colorado River, in what is now Zilker Park, in Austin. The mission was in this area for only about seven months, then was moved to San Antonio de Béxar and split into three missions.

During the 1830s, pioneers began to settle the area in central Austin along the Colorado River. Spanish forts were established in what are now Bastrop and San Marcos. Following Mexico&#x27;s independence, new settlements were established in Central Texas.

In 1835–1836, Texans fought and won independence from Mexico. Texas thus became an independent country with its own president, congress, and monetary system. In 1839, the Texas Congress formed a commission to seek a site for the new capital of the Republic of Texas to replace Houston. When he was Vice President of Texas, Mirabeau B. Lamar had visited the area during a buffalo-hunting expedition between 1837 and 1838. He advised the commissioners to consider the area on the north bank of the Colorado River (near the present-day Congress Avenue Bridge), noting the area&#x27;s hills, waterways, and pleasant surroundings. It was seen as a convenient crossroads for trade routes between Santa Fe and Galveston Bay, as well as routes between Northern Mexico and the Red River. In 1839, the site was chosen, and briefly incorporated under the name &quot;Waterloo&quot;. Shortly afterward, the name was changed to Austin in honor of Stephen F. Austin, the &quot;Father of Texas&quot; and the republic&#x27;s first secretary of state.

The city grew throughout the 19th century and became a center for government and education with the construction of the Texas State Capitol and the University of Texas at Austin.

Edwin Waller was picked by Lamar to survey the village and draft a plan laying out the new capital. The original site was narrowed to that fronted the Colorado River between two creeks, Shoal Creek and Waller Creek, which was later named in his honor. Waller and a team of surveyors developed Austin&#x27;s first city plan, commonly known as the Waller Plan, dividing the site into a 14-block grid plan bisected by a broad north–south thoroughfare, Congress Avenue, running up from the river to Capital Square, where the new Texas State Capitol was to be constructed. A temporary one-story capitol was erected on the corner of Colorado and 8th Streets. On August 1, 1839, the first auction of 217 out of 306 lots total was held. The Waller Plan designed and surveyed now forms the basis of downtown Austin.

In 1840, a series of conflicts between the Texas Rangers and the Comanches, known as the Council House Fight and the Battle of Plum Creek, pushed the Comanches westward, mostly ending conflicts in Central Texas. Settlement in the area began to expand quickly. Travis County was established in 1840, and the surrounding counties were mostly established within the next two decades.

Initially, the new capital thrived but Lamar&#x27;s political enemy, Sam Houston, used two Mexican army incursions to San Antonio as an excuse to move the government. Sam Houston fought bitterly against Lamar&#x27;s decision to establish the capital in such a remote wilderness. The men and women who traveled mainly from Houston to conduct government business were intensely disappointed as well. By 1840, the population had risen to 856, nearly half of whom fled Austin when Congress recessed. The resident African American population listed in January of this same year was 176. The fear of Austin&#x27;s proximity to the Indians and Mexico, which still considered Texas a part of their land, created an immense motive for Sam Houston, the first and third President of the Republic of Texas, to relocate the capital once again in 1841. Upon threats of Mexican troops in Texas, Houston raided the Land Office to transfer all official documents to Houston for safe keeping in what was later known as the Archive War, but the people of Austin would not allow this unaccompanied decision to be executed. The documents stayed, but the capital would temporarily move from Austin to Houston to Washington-on-the-Brazos. Without the governmental body, Austin&#x27;s population declined to a low of only a few hundred people throughout the early 1840s. The voting by the fourth President of the Republic, Anson Jones, and Congress, who reconvened in Austin in 1845, settled the issue to keep Austin the seat of government, as well as annex the Republic of Texas into the United States.

In 1860, 38% of Travis County residents were slaves. In 1861, with the outbreak of the American Civil War, voters in Austin and other Central Texas communities voted against secession. However, as the war progressed and fears of attack by Union forces increased, Austin contributed hundreds of men to the Confederate forces. The African American population of Austin swelled dramatically after the enforcement of the Emancipation Proclamation in Texas by Union General Gordon Granger at Galveston, in an event commemorated as Juneteenth. Black communities such as Wheatville, Pleasant Hill, and Clarksville were established, with Clarksville being the oldest surviving freedomtown ‒ the original post-Civil War settlements founded by former African-American slaves ‒ west of the Mississippi River. In 1870, blacks made up 36.5% of Austin&#x27;s population.

The postwar period saw dramatic population and economic growth. The opening of the Houston and Texas Central Railway (H&amp;TC) in 1871 turned Austin into the major trading center for the region, with the ability to transport both cotton and cattle. The Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas (MKT) line followed close behind. Austin was also the terminus of the southernmost leg of the Chisholm Trail, and &quot;drovers&quot; pushed cattle north to the railroad. Cotton was one of the few crops produced locally for export, and a cotton gin engine was located downtown near the trains for &quot;ginning&quot; cotton of its seeds and turning the product into bales for shipment. However, as other new railroads were built through the region in the 1870s, Austin began to lose its primacy in trade to the surrounding communities. In addition, the areas east of Austin took over cattle and cotton production from Austin, especially in towns like Hutto and Taylor that sit over the blackland prairie, with its deep, rich soils for producing cotton and hay.

In September 1881, Austin public schools held their first classes. The same year, Tillotson Collegiate and Normal Institute (now part of Huston–Tillotson University) opened its doors. The University of Texas held its first classes in 1883, although classes had been held in the original wooden state capitol for four years before.

During the 1880s, Austin gained new prominence as the state capitol building was completed in 1888 and claimed as the seventh largest building in the world. In the late 19th century, Austin expanded its city limits to more than three times its former area, and the first granite dam was built on the Colorado River to power a new street car line and the new &quot;moon towers&quot;. The first dam washed away in a flood on April 7, 1900.

In the late 1920s and 1930s, Austin implemented the 1928 Austin city plan through a series of civic development and beautification projects that created much of the city&#x27;s infrastructure and many of its parks. In addition, the state legislature established the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) that, along with the city of Austin, created the system of dams along the Colorado River to form the Highland Lakes. These projects were enabled in large part because the Public Works Administration provided Austin with greater funding for municipal construction projects than other Texas cities.

During the early 20th century, a three-way system of social segregation emerged in Austin, with Anglos, African Americans and Mexicans being separated by custom or law in most aspects of life, including housing, health care, and education. Deed restrictions also played an important role in residential segregation. After 1935 most housing deeds prohibited African Americans (and sometimes other nonwhite groups) from using land. Combined with the system of segregated public services, racial segregation increased in Austin during the first half of the twentieth century, with African Americans and Mexicans experiencing high levels of discrimination and social marginalization.

In 1940, the destroyed granite dam on the Colorado River was finally replaced by a hollow concrete dam that formed Lake McDonald (now called Lake Austin) and which has withstood all floods since. In addition, the much larger Mansfield Dam was built by the LCRA upstream of Austin to form Lake Travis, a flood-control reservoir.

In the early 20th century, the Texas Oil Boom took hold, creating tremendous economic opportunities in Southeast Texas and North Texas. The growth generated by this boom largely passed by Austin at first, with the city slipping from fourth largest to tenth largest in Texas between 1880 and 1920.

After a severe lull in economic growth from the Great Depression, Austin resumed its steady development. Following the mid-20th century, Austin became established as one of Texas&#x27; major metropolitan centers. In 1970, the U.S. Census Bureau reported Austin&#x27;s population as 14.5% Hispanic, 11.9% black, and 73.4% non-Hispanic white. In the late 20th century, Austin emerged as an important high tech center for semiconductors and software. The University of Texas at Austin emerged as a major university.

The 1970s saw Austin&#x27;s emergence in the national music scene, with local artists such as Willie Nelson, Asleep at the Wheel, and Stevie Ray Vaughan and iconic music venues such as the Armadillo World Headquarters. Over time, the long-running television program &quot;Austin City Limits&quot;, its namesake Austin City Limits Festival, and the South by Southwest music festival solidified the city&#x27;s place in the music industry.

==Geography==

Austin, the southernmost state capital of the contiguous 48 states, is located in Central Texas on the Colorado River. Austin is northwest of Houston, south of Dallas and northeast of San Antonio.

Austin occupies a total area of . Approximately of this area is water. Austin is situated at the foot of the Balcones Escarpment, on the Colorado River, with three artificial lakes within the city limits: Lady Bird Lake (formerly known as Town Lake), Lake Austin (both created by dams along the Colorado River), and Lake Walter E. Long that is partly used for cooling water for the Decker Power Plant. Mansfield Dam and the foot of Lake Travis are located within the city&#x27;s limits. Lady Bird Lake, Lake Austin, and Lake Travis are each on the Colorado River.

The elevation of Austin varies from to approximately above sea level. Due to the fact it straddles the Balcones Fault, much of the eastern part of the city is flat, with heavy clay and loam soils, whereas the western part and western suburbs consist of rolling hills on the edge of the Texas Hill Country. Because the hills to the west are primarily limestone rock with a thin covering of topsoil, portions of the city are frequently subjected to flash floods from the runoff caused by thunderstorms. To help control this runoff and to generate hydroelectric power, the Lower Colorado River Authority operates a series of dams that form the Texas Highland Lakes. The lakes also provide venues for boating, swimming, and other forms of recreation within several parks on the lake shores.

Austin is located at the intersection of four major ecological regions, and is consequently a temperate-to-hot green oasis with a highly variable climate having some characteristics of the desert, the tropics, and a wetter climate. The area is very diverse ecologically and biologically, and is home to a variety of animals and plants. Notably, the area is home to many types of wildflowers that blossom throughout the year but especially in the spring. This includes the popular bluebonnets, some planted by &quot;Lady Bird&quot; Johnson, wife of former President Lyndon B. Johnson.

The soils of Austin range from shallow, gravelly clay loams over limestone in the western outskirts to deep, fine sandy loams, silty clay loams, silty clays or clays in the city&#x27;s eastern part. Some of the clays have pronounced shrink-swell properties and are difficult to work under most moisture conditions. Many of Austin&#x27;s soils, especially the clay-rich types, are slightly to moderately alkaline and have free calcium carbonate.

===Cityscape===


Austin&#x27;s skyline historically was modest, dominated by the Texas State Capitol and the University of Texas Main Building. However, since the 2000s, many new high-rise towers have been constructed. Austin is currently undergoing a skyscraper boom, which includes recent construction on new office, hotel and residential buildings. Downtown&#x27;s buildings are somewhat spread out, partly due to a set of zoning restrictions that preserve the view of the Texas State Capitol from various locations around Austin, known as the Capitol View Corridors.

At night, parts of Austin are lit by &quot;artificial moonlight&quot; from moonlight towers built to illuminate the central part of the city. The moonlight towers were built in the late 19th century and are now recognized as historic landmarks. Only 15 of the 31 original innovative towers remain standing in Austin, but none remain in any of the other cities where they were installed. The towers are featured in the 1993 film &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;.

In December 2023, amid rising home prices, the Austin City Council loosened the city&#x27;s zoning rules to permit by-right development of triplexes on each lot and loosened restrictions on tiny homes.

====Downtown====
The central business district of Austin is home to the tallest condo towers in the state, with The Independent (58 stories and tall) and The Austonian (topping out at 56 floors and tall). The Independent became the tallest all-residential building in the U.S. west of Chicago when topped out in 2018. In 2005, then-Mayor Will Wynn set out a goal of having 25,000 people living downtown by 2015. Although downtown&#x27;s growth did not meet this goal, downtown&#x27;s residential population did surge from an estimated 5,000 in 2005 to 12,000 in 2015. The skyline has drastically changed in recent years, and the residential real estate market has remained relatively strong. , there were 31 high rise projects either under construction, approved or planned to be completed in Austin&#x27;s downtown core between 2017 and 2020. Sixteen of those were set to rise above tall, including four above 600&#x27;, and eight above 500&#x27;. An additional 15 towers were slated to stand between 300&#x27; and 399&#x27; tall.

===Climate===

Austin is located within the middle of a unique, narrow transitional zone between the dry deserts of the American Southwest and the lush, green, more humid regions of the American Southeast. Its climate, topography, and vegetation share characteristics of both. Officially, Austin has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot; under the Köppen climate classification, &quot;Cfhl&quot; under the Trewartha climate classification). This climate is typified by long, very hot summers, short, mild winters, and warm to hot spring and fall seasons in-between. Austin averages of annual rainfall distributed mostly evenly throughout the year, though spring and fall are the wettest seasons. Sunshine is common during all seasons, with 2,650 hours, or 60.3% of the possible total, of bright sunshine per year.

Summers in Austin are very hot, with average July and August highs frequently reaching the high-90s (34–36 °C) or above. Highs reach on 123 days per year, of which 29 days reach ; all years in the 1991-2020 period recorded at least 1 day of the latter. The average daytime high is or warmer between March 1 and November 21, rising to or warmer between April 14 and October 24, and reaching or warmer between May 30 and September 18. The highest ever recorded temperature was occurring on September 5, 2000, and August 28, 2011. An uncommon characteristic of Austin&#x27;s climate is its highly variable humidity, which fluctuates frequently depending on the shifting patterns of air flow and wind direction. It is common for a lengthy series of warm, dry, low-humidity days to be occasionally interrupted by very warm and humid days, and vice versa. Humidity rises with winds from the east or southeast, when the air drifts inland from the Gulf of Mexico, but decreases significantly with winds from the west or southwest, bringing air flowing from Chihuahuan Desert areas of West Texas or Northern Mexico.

Winters in Austin are mild, although occasional short-lived bursts of cold weather known as &quot;Blue Northers&quot; can occur. January is the coolest month with an average daytime high of . The overnight low drops to or below freezing 12 times per year, and sinks below during 76 evenings per year, mostly between mid-December and mid-February. The average first and last dates for a freeze are December 1 and February 15, giving Austin an average growing season of 288 days, and the coldest temperature of the year is normally about under the 1991-2020 climate normals, putting Austin in USDA zone 9a.

Conversely, winter months also produce warm days on a regular basis. On average, 10 days in January reach or exceed and 1 day reaches ; during the 1991-2020 period, all Januarys had at least 1 day with a high of or more, and most (60%) had at least 1 day with a high of or more. The lowest ever recorded temperature in the city was on January 31, 1949. Roughly every two years Austin experiences an ice storm that freezes roads over and cripples travel in the city for 24 to 48 hours. When Austin received of ice on January 24, 2014, there were 278 vehicular collisions. Similarly, snowfall is rare in Austin. A snow event of on February 4, 2011, caused more than 300 car crashes. The most recent major snow event occurred February 14–15, 2021, when of snow fell at Austin&#x27;s Camp Mabry, the largest two-day snowfall since records began being kept in 1948.

Typical of Central Texas, severe weather in Austin is a threat that can strike during any season. However, it is most common during the spring. According to most classifications, Austin lies within the extreme southern periphery of Tornado Alley, although many sources place Austin outside of Tornado Alley altogether. Consequently, tornadoes strike Austin less frequently than areas farther to the north. However, severe weather and/or supercell thunderstorms can occur multiple times per year, bringing damaging winds, lightning, heavy rain, and occasional flash flooding to the city. The deadliest storm to ever strike city limits was the twin tornadoes storm of May 4, 1922, while the deadliest tornado outbreak to ever strike the metro area was the Central Texas tornado outbreak of May 27, 1997.

===Natural disasters===

==== 2011 drought ====

From October 2010 through September 2011, both major reporting stations in Austin, Camp Mabry and Bergstrom Int&#x27;l, had the least rainfall of a water year on record, receiving less than a third of normal precipitation. This was a result of La Niña conditions in the eastern Pacific Ocean where water was significantly cooler than normal. David Brown, a regional official with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, explained that &quot;these kinds of droughts will have effects that are even more extreme in the future, given a warming and drying regional climate.&quot; The drought, coupled with exceedingly high temperatures throughout the summer of 2011, caused many wildfires throughout Texas, including notably the Bastrop County Complex Fire in neighboring Bastrop, Texas.

==== 2018 flooding and water crisis ====

In the fall of 2018, Austin and surrounding areas received heavy rainfall and flash flooding following Hurricane Sergio. The Lower Colorado River Authority opened four floodgates of the Mansfield Dam after Lake Travis was recorded at 146% full at . From October 22 to October 29, 2018, the City of Austin issued a mandatory citywide boil-water advisory after the Highland Lakes, home to the city&#x27;s main water supply, became overwhelmed by unprecedented amounts of silt, dirt, and debris that had washed in from the Llano River. Austin Water, the city&#x27;s water utility, has the capacity to process up to 300 million gallons of water per day; however, the elevated level of turbidity reduced output to only 105 million gallons per day. Since Austin residents consumed an average of 120 million gallons of water per day, the infrastructure was not able to keep up with demand.

==== 2021 winter storm ====


In February 2021, Winter Storm Uri dropped prolific amounts of snow across Texas and Oklahoma, including Austin. The Austin area received a total of of snowfall between February 14 and 15, with snow cover persisting until February 20. 
This marked the longest time the area had had more than of snow, with the previous longest time being three days in January 1985.

Lack of winterization in natural gas power plants, which supply a large amount of power to the Texas grid, and increased energy demand caused ERCOT and Austin Energy to enact rolling blackouts in order to avoid total grid collapse between February 15 and February 18. Initial rolling blackouts were to last for a maximum of 40 minutes, however lack of energy production caused many blackouts to last for much longer, at the peak of the blackouts an estimated 40% of Austin Energy homes were without power.

Starting on February 15, Austin Water received reports of pipe breaks, hourly water demand increased from 150 million gallons per day on February 15 to a peak hourly demand of 260 million gallons per day on February 16. On the morning of February 17 demand increased to 330 million gallons per day, the resulting drop of water pressure caused the Austin area to enter into a boil-water advisory which would last until water pressure was restored on February 23.

==== 2023 winter storm ====

Beginning January 30, 2023 the City of Austin experienced a winter freeze which left 170,000 Austin Energy customers without electricity or heat for several days. The slow pace of repairs and lack of public information from City officials frustrated many residents. A week after the freeze and when Austin City Council members were proposing to evaluate his employment, City Manager Spencer Cronk finally apologized. On Thursday February 16, 2023, Cronk was fired by the Austin City Council for the city&#x27;s response to the winter storm. Former City Manager Jesus Garcia was named Interim City Manager.

===Parks===
The Austin Parks and Recreation Department received the Excellence in Aquatics award in 1999 and the Gold Medal Awards in 2004 from the National Recreation and Park Association.

To strengthen the region&#x27;s parks system, which spans more than , The Austin Parks Foundation was established in 1992 to develop and improve parks in and around Austin. APF works to fill the city&#x27;s park funding gap by leveraging volunteers, philanthropists, park advocates, and strategic collaborations to develop, maintain and enhance Austin&#x27;s parks, trails and green spaces.

===Lady Bird Lake===



Lady Bird Lake (formerly Town Lake) is a river-like reservoir on the Colorado River. The lake is a popular recreational area for paddleboards, kayaks, canoes, dragon boats, and rowing shells. Austin&#x27;s warm climate and the river&#x27;s calm waters, nearly length and straight courses are especially popular with crew teams and clubs. Other recreational attractions along the shores of the lake include swimming in Deep Eddy Pool, the oldest swimming pool in Texas, and Red Bud Isle, a small island formed by the 1900 collapse of the McDonald Dam that serves as a recreation area with a dog park and access to the lake for canoeing and fishing. The Ann and Roy Butler Hike and Bike Trail forms a complete circuit around the lake. A local nonprofit, The Trail Foundation, is the Trail&#x27;s private steward and has built amenities and infrastructure including trailheads, lakefront gathering areas, restrooms, exercise equipment, as well as doing Trailwide ecological restoration work on an ongoing basis. The Butler Trail loop was completed in 2014 with the public-private partnership 1-mile Boardwalk project.

Along the shores of Lady Bird Lake is the Zilker Park, which contains large open lawns, sports fields, cross country courses, historical markers, concession stands, and picnic areas. Zilker Park is also home to numerous attractions, including the Zilker Botanical Garden, the Umlauf Sculpture Garden, Zilker Hillside Theater, the Austin Nature &amp; Science Center, and the Zilker Zephyr, a gauge miniature railway carries passengers on a tour around the park. Auditorium Shores, an urban park along the lake, is home to the Palmer Auditorium, the Long Center for the Performing Arts, and an off-leash dog park on the water. Both Zilker Park and Auditorium Shores have a direct view of the Downtown skyline.

===Barton Creek Greenbelt===

The Barton Creek Greenbelt is a public green belt managed by the City of Austin&#x27;s Park and Recreation Department. The Greenbelt, which begins at Zilker Park and stretches South/Southwest to the Woods of Westlake subdivision, is characterized by large limestone cliffs, dense foliage, and shallow bodies of water. Popular activities include rock climbing, mountain biking, and hiking. Some well known naturally forming swimming holes along Austin&#x27;s greenbelt include Twin Falls, Sculpture Falls, Gus Fruh Pool, and Campbell&#x27;s Hole. During years of heavy rainfall, the water level of the creek rises high enough to allow swimming, cliff diving, kayaking, paddle boarding, and tubing.

===Swimming holes===

Austin is home to more than 50 public pools and swimming holes. These include Deep Eddy Pool, Texas&#x27; oldest human-made swimming pool, and Barton Springs Pool, the nation&#x27;s largest natural swimming pool in an urban area. Barton Springs Pool is spring-fed while Deep Eddy is well-fed. Both range in temperature from about during the winter to about during the summer. Hippie Hollow Park, a county park situated along Lake Travis, is the only officially sanctioned clothing-optional public park in Texas. Hamilton Pool Preserve is a natural pool that was created when the dome of an underground river collapsed due to massive erosion thousands of years ago. The pool, located about west of Austin, is a popular summer swimming spot for visitors and residents. Hamilton Pool Preserve consists of of protected natural habitat featuring a jade green pool into which a waterfall flows.

====Other parks====

In May 2021, voters in the City of Austin reinstated a public camping ban. That includes downtown green spaces as well as trails and greenbelts such as along Barton Creek.

McKinney Falls State Park is a state park administered by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, located at the confluence of Onion Creek and Williamson Creek. The park includes several designated hiking trails and campsites with water and electric. The namesake features of the park are the scenic upper and lower falls along Onion Creek. The Emma Long Metropolitan Park is a municipal park along the shores of Lake Austin, originally constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps. The Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center is a botanical garden and arboretum that features more than 800 species of native Texas plants in both garden and natural settings; the Wildflower Center is located southwest of Downtown in Circle C Ranch. Roy G. Guerrero Park is located along the Colorado River in East Riverside and contains miles of wooded trails, a sandy beach along the river, and a disc golf course.

Covert Park, located on the top of Mount Bonnell, is a popular tourist destination overlooking Lake Austin and the Colorado River. The mount provides a vista for viewing the city of Austin, Lake Austin, and the surrounding hills. It was designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1969, bearing Marker number 6473, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015.

The Louis René Barrera Indiangrass Wildlife Sanctuary, located on the north shore of Lake Walter E. Long, is a park managed by the Austin Parks and Recreation Department with the goal of restoring the Blackland Prairie. While not open to the public, it is accessible through guided tours.

A 2014 University of Texas study stated that Austin was the only U.S. city with a fast growth rate between 2000 and 2010 with a net loss in African Americans. , Austin&#x27;s African American and non-Hispanic white percentage shares of the total population was declining despite the actual numbers of both ethnic groups increasing, as the rapid growth of the Latino or Hispanic and Asian populations has outpaced all other ethnic groups in the city. Austin&#x27;s non-Hispanic white population first dropped below 50% in 2005.

=== Sexual orientation and gender identity ===
According to a survey completed in 2014 by Gallup, it is estimated that 5.3% of residents in the Austin metropolitan area identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. The Austin metropolitan area had the third-highest rate in the nation.

=== Religion ===
According to Sperling&#x27;s BestPlaces, 52.4% of Austin&#x27;s population are religious. The majority of Austinites identified themselves as Christians, about 25.2% of whom claimed affiliation with the Catholic Church. The city&#x27;s Catholic population is served by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Austin, headquartered at the Cathedral of Saint Mary. Nationwide, 23% of Americans identified as Catholic in 2016.

Judaism forms less than 0.1% of the religious demographic in Austin. Orthodox, Reform, and Conservative congregations are present in the community. The same study says that eastern faiths including Buddhism and Hinduism made up 0.9% of the city&#x27;s religious population. Several Hindu temples exist in the Austin Metropolitan area with the most notable one being Radha Madhav Dham. In addition to those religious groups, Austin is also home to an active secular humanist community, hosting nationwide television shows and charity work.

=== Homelessness ===
As of 2019, there were 2,255 individuals experiencing homelessness in Travis County. Of those, 1,169 were sheltered and 1,086 were unsheltered. In September 2019, the Austin City Council approved $62.7 million for programs aimed at homelessness, which includes housing displacement prevention, crisis mitigation, and affordable housing; the city council also earmarked $500,000 for crisis services and encampment cleanups.

In June 2019, following &quot;Martin v. Boise&quot;, a federal court ruling on homelessness sleeping in public, the Austin City Council lifted a 25-year-old ban on camping, sitting, or lying down in public unless doing so causes an obstruction. The resolution also included the approval of a new housing-focused shelter in South Austin. In early October 2019, Texas Governor Greg Abbott sent a letter to Mayor Steve Adler threatening to deploy state resources to combat the camping ban repeal. On October 17, 2019, the City Council revised the camping ordinance, which imposed increased restrictions on sidewalk camping. In November 2019, the State of Texas opened a temporary homeless encampment on a former vehicle storage yard owned by the Texas Department of Transportation.

In May 2021, the camping ban was reinstated after a ballot proposition was approved by 57% of voters. The ban introduces penalties for camping, sitting, or lying down on a public sidewalk or sleeping outdoors in or near Downtown Austin or the area around the University of Texas campus.

The Greater Austin metropolitan statistical area had a gross domestic product (GDP) of $222 billion in 2022. Austin is considered to be a major center for high tech. Thousands of graduates each year from the engineering and computer science programs at the University of Texas at Austin provide a steady source of employees that help to fuel Austin&#x27;s technology and defense industry sectors. As a result of the high concentration of high-tech companies in the region, Austin was strongly affected by the dot-com boom in the late 1990s and subsequent bust. Austin&#x27;s largest employers include the Austin Independent School District, the City of Austin, Dell Technologies, the U.S. Federal Government, NXP Semiconductors, IBM, St. David&#x27;s Healthcare Partnership, Seton Family of Hospitals, the State of Texas, the Texas State University, and the University of Texas at Austin.

The proliferation of technology companies has led to the region&#x27;s nickname, &quot;Silicon Hills&quot;, and spurred development that greatly expanded the city.

Tesla, Inc., an electric vehicle and clean energy company has its corporate headquarters in Austin inside Gigafactory Texas, a large vehicle assembly plant which employs over 20,000 people. The company expects to eventually have a staff of 60,000 in the Austin area as production ramps up.

Austin is also emerging as a hub for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies; the city is home to about 85 of them. In 2004, the city was ranked by the Milken Institute as the No. 12 biotech and life science center in the United States and in 2018, CBRE Group ranked Austin as #3 emerging life sciences cluster.

====Highways====
Central Austin lies between two major north–south freeways: I-35 to the east and the Mopac Expressway (Loop 1) to the west. US 183 runs from northwest to southeast, and SH 71 crosses the southern part of the city from east to west, completing a rough &quot;box&quot; around central and north-central Austin. Austin is the largest city in the United States to be served by only one Interstate Highway.

US 290 enters Austin from the east and merges into I-35. Its highway designation continues south on I-35 and then becomes part of SH 71, continuing to the west. Highway 290 splits from Highway 71 in southwest Austin, in an interchange known as &quot;The Y.&quot; SH 71 continues to Brady, Texas, and Highway 290 continues west to intersect I-10 near Junction. Interstate 35 continues south through San Antonio to Laredo on the Mexican border. I-35 is the highway link to the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex in Northern Texas. There are two links to Houston (US 290 and SH 71/I-10). US 183 leads northwest of Austin toward Lampasas.

In the mid-1980s, construction was completed on Loop 360, a scenic highway that curves through the hill country from near the 71/Mopac interchange in the south to near the US 183/Mopac interchange in the north. The iconic Pennybacker Bridge, also known as the &quot;360 Bridge,&quot; crosses Lake Austin to connect the northern and southern portions of Loop 360.

====Tollways====

SH 130 is a bypass route designed to relieve traffic congestion, starting from Interstate 35 just north of Georgetown and running along a parallel route to the east, where it bypasses Round Rock, Austin, San Marcos and New Braunfels before ending at I-10 east of Seguin, where drivers could drive west to return to I-35 in San Antonio. The first segment was opened in November 2006, which was located east of Austin–Bergstrom International Airport at Austin&#x27;s southeast corner on SH 71. Highway 130 runs concurrently with SH 45 from Pflugerville on the north until it reaches US 183 well south of Austin, at which point SR 45 continues west. The entire route of SH 130 is now complete. The final leg opened on November 1, 2012. The highway is noted for having a maximum speed limit of for the entire route. The section of the toll road between Mustang Ridge and Seguin has a posted speed limit of , the highest posted speed limit in the United States.

SH 45 runs east–west from just south of US 183 in Cedar Park to 130 inside Pflugerville (just east of Round Rock). A tolled extension of State Highway Loop 1 was also created. A new southeast leg of SH 45 has recently been completed, running from US 183 and the south end of Segment 5 of TX-130 south of Austin due west to I-35 at the FM 1327/Creedmoor Road exit between the south end of Austin and Buda. The 183A Toll Road opened in March 2007, providing a tolled alternative to US 183 through the cities of Leander and Cedar Park. Currently under construction is a change to East US 290 from US 183 to the town of Manor. Officially, the tollway will be dubbed Tollway 290 with &quot;Manor Expressway&quot; as nickname.

Despite the overwhelming initial opposition to the toll road concept when it was first announced, all three toll roads have exceeded revenue projections.

====Airports====
Austin&#x27;s primary airport is Austin–Bergstrom International Airport (ABIA) (IATA code AUS), located southeast of the city. The airport is on the site of the former Bergstrom Air Force Base, which was closed in 1993 as part of the Base Realignment and Closure process. Until 1999, Robert Mueller Municipal Airport was Austin&#x27;s main airport until ABIA took that role and the old airport was shut down. Austin Executive Airport, along with several smaller airports outside the city center, serves general aviation traffic.

====Intercity transit====
Amtrak&#x27;s Austin station is located in west downtown and is served by the &quot;Texas Eagle&quot; which runs daily between Chicago and San Antonio, continuing on to Los Angeles several times a week.

Railway segments between Austin and San Antonio have been evaluated for a proposed regional passenger rail project called &quot;Lone Star Rail&quot;. However, failure to come to an agreement with the track&#x27;s current owner, Union Pacific Railroad, ended the project in 2016.

Greyhound Lines operates the current Austin Bus Station at the Eastside Bus Plaza Grupo Senda&#x27;s Turimex Internacional service operates bus service from Austin to Nuevo Laredo and on to many destinations in Mexico from their station in East Austin. Megabus offers daily service to San Antonio, Dallas/Fort Worth and Houston.

====Public transportation====

The Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority (CapMetro) provides public transportation to the city, primarily with its CapMetro Bus local bus service, the CapMetro Express express bus system, as well as a bus rapid transit service, CapMetro Rapid. CapMetro opened a hybrid rail system, CapMetro Rail, in 2010. The system consists of a single line serving downtown Austin, the neighborhoods of East Austin, North Central Austin, and Northwest Austin plus the suburb of Leander.

Since it began operations in 1985, CapMetro has proposed adding light rail services to its network. Despite support from the City Council, voters rejected light rail proposals in 2000 and 2014. However, in 2020, voters approved CapMetro&#x27;s transit expansion plan, Project Connect, by a comfortable margin. The plan proposes 2 new light rail lines, an additional bus rapid transit line (which could be converted to light rail in the future), a second commuter rail line, several new MetroRapid lines, more MetroExpress routes, and a number of other infrastructure, technology and service expansion projects.

Capital Area Rural Transportation System connects Austin with outlying suburbs and surrounding rural areas.

====Ride sharing====

Austin is served by several ride-sharing companies including Uber and Lyft. On May 9, 2016, Uber and Lyft voluntarily ceased operations in Austin in response to a city ordinance that required ride sharing company drivers to get fingerprint checks, have their vehicles labeled, and not pick up or drop off in certain city lanes. Uber and Lyft resumed service in the summer of 2017. The city was previously served by Fasten until they ceased all operations in the city in March 2018.

Austin is also served by Electric Cab of North America&#x27;s six-passenger electric cabs that operate on a flexible route from the Kramer MetroRail Station to Domain Northside and from the Downtown CapMetro Rail station and MetroRapid stops to locations between the Austin Convention Center and near Sixth and Bowie streets by Whole Foods.

Carsharing service Zipcar operates in Austin and, until 2019, the city was also served by Car2Go which kept its North American headquarters in the city even after pulling out.

====Cycling and walking====

The city&#x27;s bike advocacy organization is Bike Austin. BikeTexas, a state-level advocacy organization, also has its main office in Austin.

Bicycles are a popular transportation choice among students, faculty, and staff at the University of Texas. According to a survey done at the University of Texas, 57% of commuters bike to campus.

The City of Austin and CapMetro jointly own a bike-sharing service, CapMetro Bike, which is available in and around downtown. The service is a franchise of BCycle, a national bike sharing network owned by Trek Bicycle, and is operated by local nonprofit organization Bike Share of Austin. Until 2020 the service was known as Austin BCycle. In 2018, Lime began offering dockless bikes, which do not need to be docked at a designated station.

In 2018, scooter-sharing companies Lime and Bird debuted rentable electric scooters in Austin. The city briefly banned the scooters — which began operations before the city could implement a permitting system — until the city completed development of their &quot;dockless mobility&quot; permitting process on May 1, 2018. Dockless electric scooters and bikes are banned from Austin city parks and the Ann and Roy Butler Trail and Boardwalk. For the 2018 Austin City Limits Music Festival, the city of Austin offered a designated parking area for dockless bikes and scooters.

==== Parking lots ====
In November 2023, Austin became the largest city in the US that has abolished parking mandates. It did so to encourage walking, biking, and public transit use, as well as to lower the cost of housing and increase the amount of housing units that can be built in the city. Portland and Minneapolis also took this action.

==Culture==


&quot;Keep Austin Weird&quot; has been a local motto for years, featured on bumper stickers and T-shirts. This motto has not only been used in promoting Austin&#x27;s eccentricity and diversity, but is also meant to bolster support of local independent businesses. According to the 2010 book &quot;Weird City&quot; the phrase was begun by a local Austin Community College librarian, Red Wassenich, and his wife, Karen Pavelka, who were concerned about Austin&#x27;s &quot;rapid descent into commercialism and overdevelopment.&quot; The slogan has been interpreted many ways since its inception, but remains an important symbol for many Austinites who wish to voice concerns over rapid growth and development. Austin has a long history of vocal citizen resistance to development projects perceived to degrade the environment, or to threaten the natural and cultural landscapes.

According to the Nielsen Company, adults in Austin read and contribute to blogs more than those in any other U.S. metropolitan area and have the highest Internet usage in all of Texas. In 2013, Austin was the most active city on Reddit, having the largest number of views per capita.

South Congress is a shopping district stretching down South Congress Avenue from Downtown. This area is home to coffee shops, eccentric stores, restaurants, food trucks, trailers, and festivals. It prides itself on &quot;Keeping Austin Weird,&quot; especially with development in the surrounding area(s). Many Austinites attribute its enduring popularity to the unobstructed view of the Texas State Capitol.

The Rainey Street Historic District is a neighborhood in Downtown Austin formerly consisting of bungalow style homes built in the early 20th century. Since the early 2010s, the former working class residential street has turned into a popular nightlife district. Much of the historic homes have been renovated into hotels, condominiums, bars and restaurants, many of which feature large porches and outdoor yards for patrons. The Rainey Street district is also home to the Emma S. Barrientos Mexican American Cultural Center.

Austin has been part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network under Media Arts the category.

===Old Austin===

&quot;Old Austin&quot; is an adage often used by nostalgic natives. The term &quot;Old Austin&quot; refers to a time when the city was smaller and more bohemian with a considerably lower cost of living and better known for its lack of traffic, hipsters, and urban sprawl. It is often employed by longtime residents expressing displeasure at the rapidly changing culture, or when referencing nostalgia of Austin culture.

The growth and popularity of Austin can be seen by the expansive development taking place in its downtown landscape. This growth can have a negative impact on longtime small businesses that cannot keep up with the expenses associated with gentrification and the rising cost of real estate. A former Austin musician, Dale Watson, described his move away from Austin, &quot;I just really feel the city has sold itself. Just because you&#x27;re going to get $45 million for a company to come to town – if it&#x27;s not in the best interest of the town, I don&#x27;t think they should do it. This city was never about money. It was about quality of life.&quot; Though much is changing rapidly in Austin, businesses such as Thundercloud Subs are thought by many to maintain classic Austin business cultural sentiments unique to the history of the city; as Diana Burgess stated, &quot;I definitely appreciate that they haven&#x27;t raised their prices a ton or made things super fancy. I think it speaks to that original Old Austin vibe. A lot of us that grew up here really appreciate that.&quot; Aaron Franklin, owner of Franklin Barbecue, credited the Old Austin cultural mindset and community support with the success of his barbecue restaurant and the long lines that have supported his business since starting it out of a food trailer in 2009.

===Annual cultural events===

The O. Henry House Museum hosts the annual O. Henry Pun-Off, a pun contest where the successful contestants exhibit wit akin to that of the author William Sydney Porter.

Sixth Street features annual festivals such as the Pecan Street Festival and Halloween night. The three-day Austin City Limits Music Festival has been held in Zilker Park every year since 2002. Every year around the end of March and the beginning of April, Austin is home to &quot;Texas Relay Weekend.&quot;

Austin&#x27;s Zilker Park Tree is a Christmas display made of lights strung from the top of a Moonlight tower in Zilker Park. The Zilker Tree is lit in December along with the &quot;Trail of Lights,&quot; an Austin Christmas tradition. The Trail of Lights was canceled four times, first starting in 2001 and 2002 due to the September 11 Attacks, and again in 2010 and 2011 due to budget shortfalls, but the trail was turned back on for the 2012 holiday season.

From 1962 to 1998, the Austin Aqua Festival, or &quot;Aqua Fest&quot;, took place on the shores of Town Lake (now known as Lady Bird Lake). Originally conceived as a summer tourism draw, the multi-day event evolved from water-themed activities to a broader civic festival due to growth and community interest. Eventually attendance and financial solvency began to dwindle as larger music and summer festivals grew in prominence.

===Cuisine and breweries===
Notable Austin cuisine includes Texas barbecue and Tex-Mex; Franklin Barbecue in Austin&#x27;s has sold out of brisket every day since its establishment. Breakfast tacos and queso are popular food items in the city; Austin is sometimes called the &quot;home of the breakfast taco.&quot; Kolaches are a common pastry in Austin bakeries due to the large Czech and German immigrant population in Texas. The Oasis Restaurant is the largest outdoor restaurant in Texas, which promotes itself as the &quot;Sunset Capital of Texas&quot; with its terraced views looking West over Lake Travis. Birdie&#x27;s, a counter-service restaurant and wine bar that opened in 2021, was &quot;Food &amp; Wine&quot;&#x27;s 2023 Restaurant of the Year.

P. Terry&#x27;s, an Austin-based fast food burger chain, has a loyal following among Austinites. Some other Austin-based chain restaurants include Amy&#x27;s Ice Creams, Chuy&#x27;s, DoubleDave&#x27;s Pizzaworks, and Schlotzky&#x27;s. The Chili&#x27;s at 45th and Lamar has been the subject of internet memes since 2011.

As Austin&#x27;s official slogan is &quot;The Live Music Capital of the World&quot;, the city has a vibrant live music scene with more music venues per capita than any other U.S. city. Austin&#x27;s music revolves around the many nightclubs on 6th Street and an annual music/film/interactive festival known as South by Southwest (SXSW). The concentration of restaurants, bars, and music venues in the city&#x27;s downtown core is a major contributor to Austin&#x27;s live music scene, as the ZIP Code encompassing the downtown entertainment district hosts the most bar or alcohol-serving establishments in the U.S.

The longest-running concert music program on American television, &quot;Austin City Limits&quot;, is recorded at ACL Live at The Moody Theater, located in the bottom floor of the W Hotels in Austin. &quot;Austin City Limits&quot; and C3 Presents produce the Austin City Limits Music Festival, an annual music and art festival held at Zilker Park in Austin.

The Austin Aces played their matches at the Cedar Park Center northwest of Austin, and featured former professionals Andy Roddick and Marion Bartoli, as well as current WTA tour player Vera Zvonareva. The team left after the 2015 season.

In 2017, Precourt Sports Ventures announced a plan to move the Columbus Crew SC soccer franchise from Columbus, Ohio to Austin. Precourt negotiated an agreement with the City of Austin to build a $200 million privately funded stadium on public land at 10414 McKalla Place, following initial interest in Butler Shores Metropolitan Park and Roy G. Guerrero Colorado River Park. As part of an arrangement with the league, operational rights of Columbus Crew SC were sold in late 2018, and Austin FC was announced as Major League Soccer&#x27;s 27th franchise on January 15, 2019, with the expansion team starting play in 2021.

The Austin Country Club is a private golf club located along the shores of the Colorado River, right next to the Pennybacker Bridge. Founded in 1899, the club moved to its third and present site in 1984, which features a challenging layout designed by noted course architect Pete Dye.

Austin is set to host the BLAST.TV Austin Major, the 22nd &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; Major esports tournament, from June 9 to 22, 2025.

==Government==

===City government===

Austin is administered by an 11-member city council (10 council members elected by geographic district plus a mayor elected at large). The council is accompanied by a hired city manager under the manager-council system of municipal governance. Council and mayoral elections are non-partisan, with a runoff in case there is no majority winner. A referendum approved by voters on November 6, 2012, changed the council composition from six council members plus a mayor elected at large to the current &quot;10+1&quot; district system. Supporters maintained that the at-large system would increase participation for all areas of the city, especially for those which had lacked representation from City Council.

November 2014 marked the first election under the new system. The Federal government had forced San Antonio and Dallas to abandon at-large systems before 1987; however, the court could not show a racist pattern in Austin and upheld the city&#x27;s at-large system during a 1984 lawsuit. In five elections between 1973 and 1994 Austin voters rejected single-member districts.

Austin formerly operated its city hall at 128 West 8th Street. Antoine Predock and Cotera Kolar Negrete &amp; Reed Architects designed a new city hall building, which was intended to reflect what &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; referred to as a &quot;crazy-quilt vitality, that embraces everything from country music to environmental protests and high-tech swagger.&quot; The new city hall, built from recycled materials, has solar panels in its garage. The city hall, at 301 West Second Street, opened in November 2004. Kirk Watson is the current mayor of Austin, assuming the office for a second non-consecutive term on January 6, 2023.

In the 2012 elections, City Council elections were moved from May to November and City council members were given staggered term limits In 2022 Proposition D moved the term of the Austin Mayor to coincide with Presidential election years, so Kirk Watson would only serve two years unlike his predecessor Steve Adler

Law enforcement in Austin is provided by the Austin Police Department, except for state government buildings, which are patrolled by the Texas Department of Public Safety. The University of Texas Police operate from the University of Texas.

Fire protection within the city limits is provided by the Austin Fire Department, while the surrounding county is divided into twelve geographical areas known as emergency services districts, which are covered by separate regional fire departments. Emergency medical services are provided for the whole county by Austin-Travis County Emergency Medical Services.

Mayor Kirk Watson (D)
In 2003, the city adopted a resolution against the USA PATRIOT Act that reaffirmed constitutionally guaranteed rights.

===Crime===
As of 2019, Austin is one of the safest large cities in the United States. In 2019, the FBI named Austin the 11th safest city on a list of 22 American cities with a population above 400,000.

FBI statistics show that overall violent and property crimes dropped in Austin in 2015, but increased in suburban areas of the city. One such southeastern suburb, Del Valle, reported eight homicides within two months in 2016. According to 2016 APD crime statistics, the 78723 census tract had the most violent crime, with 6 murders, 25 rapes, and 81 robberies. The city had 39 homicides in 2016, the most since 1997.

====Notable incidents====
One of the first American mass school shooting incidents took place in Austin on August 1, 1966, when Charles Whitman shot 43 people, killing 13 from the top of the University of Texas tower. The University of Texas tower shooting led to the formation of the SWAT team of the Austin Police Department.

In 1991, four teenage girls were murdered in a yogurt shop by an unknown assailant(s). A police officer responded to reports of a fire at the I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s Yogurt! store on Anderson Lane and discovered the girls&#x27; bodies in a back room. The murders remain unsolved.

In 2010, Andrew Joseph Stack III deliberately crashed his Piper PA-28 Cherokee into Echelon 1, a building in which the Internal Revenue Service was a lessee of, housing 190 employees. The resulting explosion killed one and injured 13 IRS employees, partially damaged the building and cost the IRS a total of $38.6 million. &quot;(see 2010 Austin suicide attack)&quot;

A series of bombings occurred in Austin in March 2018. Over the course of 20 days, five package bombs exploded, killing two people and injuring another five. The suspect, 23-year-old Mark Anthony Conditt of Pflugerville, Texas, blew himself up inside his vehicle after he was pulled over by police on March 21, also injuring a police officer.

In 2020, Austin was the victim of a cyberattack by the Russian group Berserk Bear, possibly related to the U.S. federal government data breach earlier that year.

On April 18, 2021, a shooting occurred at the Arboretum Oaks Apartments near The Arboretum shopping center, in which a former Travis County Sheriff&#x27;s Office detective killed his ex-wife, his adoptive daughter, and his daughter&#x27;s boyfriend. The suspect, who was previously charged with child sexual assault, was arrested in Manor after a 20-hour manhunt.

A mass shooting took place in the early morning of June 12, 2021, on Sixth Street, which resulted in 14 people injured and one dead. The man killed was believed to be an innocent bystander who was struck as he was standing outside a bar. A 19-year-old suspect, De&#x27;ondre &quot;Dre&quot; White, was formally charged and arrested in Killeen nearly two weeks after the shooting.

In 2024, Zacharia Doar, a 23-year old Palestinian-American man, was attacked and stabbed in the chest on West 26th Street, West Campus, after returning from a rally in support of Palestinian human rights. The assailant, 36-year old Bert James Baker was arrested at the scene and charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.

===Other levels of government===
Austin is the county seat of Travis County and hosts the Heman Marion Sweatt Travis County Courthouse downtown, as well as other county government offices. The Texas Department of Transportation operates the Austin District Office in Austin. The Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) operates the Austin I and Austin II district parole offices in Austin. The United States Postal Service operates several post offices in Austin.

===Politics===

Former Governor Rick Perry had previously referred to it as a &quot;blueberry in the tomato soup&quot;, meaning, Austin had previously been a Democratic city in a Republican state. However, Texas currently has multiple urban cities also voting Democratic and electing Democratic mayors in elections.

After the most recent redistricting, Austin is currently divided between the 10th, 35th and 37th Congressional districts.

====Issues====
A controversial turning point in the political history of the Austin area was the 2003 Texas redistricting. Before then, Austin had been entirely or almost entirely within the borders of a single congressional district–what was then the 10th District–for over a century. Opponents characterized the resulting district layout as excessively partisan gerrymandering, and the plan was challenged in court by Democratic and minority activists. The Supreme Court of the United States has never struck down a redistricting plan for being excessively partisan. The plan was subsequently upheld by a three-judge federal panel in late 2003, and on June 28, 2006, the matter was largely settled when the Supreme Court, in a 7–2 decision, upheld the entire congressional redistricting plan with the exception of a Hispanic-majority district in southwest Texas. This affected Austin&#x27;s districting, as U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett&#x27;s district (U.S. Congressional District 25) was found to be insufficiently compact to compensate for the reduced minority influence in the southwest district; it was redrawn so that it took in most of southeastern Travis County and several counties to its south and east.

====Environmental movement====
The distinguishing political movement of Austin politics has been that of the environmental movement, which spawned the parallel neighborhood movement, then the more recent conservationist movement (as typified by the Hill Country Conservancy), and eventually the current ongoing debate about &quot;sense of place&quot; and preserving the Austin quality of life. Much of the environmental movement has matured into a debate on issues related to saving and creating an Austin &quot;sense of place.&quot; In 2012, Austin became just one of a few cities in Texas to ban the sale and use of plastic bags. However, the ban ended in 2018 due to a court ruling that regarded all bag bans in the state to contravene the Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act. In 2016, Austin became the first Gold designee of the SolSmart program, a national program from the U.S. Department of Energy that recognizes local governments for enacting solar-friendly measures at the local level.

==Education==

According to the 2015–2019 Census estimates, 51.7% of Austin residents aged 25 and over have earned at least a bachelor&#x27;s degree, compared with the national figure of 32.1%. 19.4% hold a graduate or professional degree, compared with the national figure of 12.4%.

===Higher education===

===Public primary and secondary education===

Approximately half of the city by area is served by the Austin Independent School District. This district includes notable schools such as the magnet Liberal Arts and Science Academy High School of Austin, Texas (LASA), which, by test scores, has consistently been within the top thirty high schools in the nation, as well as The Ann Richards School for Young Women Leaders. The remaining portion of Austin is served by adjoining school districts, including Round Rock ISD, Pflugerville ISD, Leander ISD, Manor ISD, Del Valle ISD, Lake Travis ISD, Hays ISD, and Eanes ISD.

==Media==

Austin&#x27;s main daily newspaper is the &quot;Austin American-Statesman&quot;. &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; is Austin&#x27;s alternative weekly, while &quot;The Daily Texan&quot; is the student newspaper of the University of Texas at Austin. Austin&#x27;s business newspaper is the weekly &quot;Austin Business Journal&quot;. &quot;The Austin Monitor&quot; is an online outlet that specializes in insider reporting on City Hall, Travis County Commissioners Court, AISD, and other related local civics beats. The &quot;Monitor&quot; is backed by the nonprofit Capital of Texas Media Foundation. Austin also has numerous smaller special interest or sub-regional newspapers such as the &quot;Oak Hill Gazette&quot;, &quot;Westlake Picayune&quot;, &quot;Hill Country News&quot;, &quot;Round Rock Leader&quot;, &quot;NOKOA&quot;, and &quot;The Villager&quot; among others. &quot;Texas Monthly&quot;, a major regional magazine, is also headquartered in Austin. The &quot;Texas Observer&quot;, a muckraking biweekly political magazine, has been based in Austin for over five decades. The weekly &quot;Community Impact Newspaper&quot; published by John Garrett, former publisher of the &quot;Austin Business Journal&quot; has five regional editions and is delivered to every house and business within certain ZIP codes and all of the news is specific to those ZIP codes. Another statewide publication based in Austin is &quot;The Texas Tribune&quot;, an on-line publication focused on Texas politics. The &quot;Tribune&quot; is &quot;user-supported&quot; through donations, a business model similar to public radio. The editor is Evan Smith, former editor of &quot;Texas Monthly&quot;. Smith co-founded the &quot;Texas Tribune&quot;, a nonprofit, non-partisan public media organization, with Austin venture capitalist John Thornton and veteran journalist Ross Ramsey.

Commercial radio stations include KASE-FM (country), KVET (sports), KVET-FM (country), KKMJ-FM (adult contemporary), KLBJ (talk), KLBJ-FM (classic rock), KJFK (variety hits), KFMK (contemporary Christian), KOKE-FM (progressive country) and KPEZ (rhythmic contemporary).

KLRU produces several award-winning locally produced programs such as &quot;Austin City Limits&quot;. Despite Austin&#x27;s explosive growth, it is only a medium-sized market (currently 38th) because the suburban and rural areas are not much larger than the city proper. Additionally, the proximity of San Antonio truncates the potential market area.

Alex Jones, journalist, radio show host and filmmaker, produces his talk show &quot;The Alex Jones Show&quot; in Austin which broadcasts nationally on more than 60 AM and FM radio stations in the United States, WWCR Radio shortwave and XM Radio: Channel 166.

<text>The argument from morality is an argument for the existence of God. Arguments from morality tend to be based on moral normativity or moral order. Arguments from moral normativity observe some aspect of morality and argue that God is the best or only explanation for this, concluding that God must exist. Arguments from moral order are based on the asserted need for moral order to exist in the universe. They claim that, for this moral order to exist, God must exist to support it. The argument from morality is noteworthy in that one cannot evaluate the soundness of the argument without attending to almost every important philosophical issue in meta-ethics.

German philosopher Immanuel Kant devised an argument from morality based on practical reason. Kant argued that the goal of humanity is to achieve perfect happiness and virtue (the &quot;summum bonum&quot;) and believed that an afterlife must be assumed to exist in order for this to be possible, and that God must be assumed to exist to provide this. Rather than aiming to prove the existence of God, however, Kant was simply attempting to demonstrate that all moral thought requires the assumption that God exists, and therefore that we are entitled to make such an assumption only as a regulative principle rather than a constitutive principle (meaning that such a principle can guide our actions, but it does not provide knowledge). In his book &quot;Mere Christianity&quot;, C. S. Lewis argued that &quot;conscience reveals to us a moral law whose source cannot be found in the natural world, thus pointing to a supernatural Lawgiver.&quot; Lewis argued that accepting the validity of human reason as a given must include accepting the validity of practical reason, which could not be valid without reference to a higher cosmic moral order which could not exist without a God to create and/or establish it. A related argument is from conscience; John Henry Newman argued that the conscience supports the claim that objective moral truths exist because it drives people to act morally even when it is not in their own interest. Newman argued that, because the conscience suggests the existence of objective moral truths, God must exist to give authority to these truths.

Contemporary defenders of the argument from morality are Graham Ward, Alister McGrath and William Lane Craig.

==General form==
All variations of the argument from morality begin with an observation about moral thought or experiences and conclude with the existence of God. Some of these arguments propose moral facts which they claim evident through human experience, arguing that God is the best explanation for these. Other versions describe some end which humans should strive to attain that is only possible if God exists.

Many arguments from morality are based on moral normativity, which suggests that objective moral truths exist and require God&#x27;s existence to give them authority. Often, they consider that morality seems to be binding – obligations are seen to convey more than just a preference, but imply that the obligation will stand, regardless of other factors or interests. For morality to be binding, God must exist. In its most general form, the argument from moral normativity is:

#A human experience of morality is observed.
#God is the best or only explanation for this moral experience.
#Therefore, God exists.

Some arguments from moral order suggest that morality is based on rationality and that this can only be the case if there is a moral order in the universe. The arguments propose that only the existence of God as orthodoxly conceived could support the existence of moral order in the universe, so God must exist. Alternative arguments from moral order have proposed that we have an obligation to attain the perfect good of both happiness and moral virtue. They attest that whatever we are obliged to do must be possible, and achieving the perfect good of both happiness and moral virtue is only possible if a natural moral order exists. A natural moral order requires the existence of God as orthodoxly conceived, so God must exist.

==Variations==

===Practical reason===

In his &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;, German philosopher Immanuel Kant stated that no successful argument for God&#x27;s existence arises from reason alone. In his &quot;Critique of Practical Reason&quot; he went on to argue that, despite the failure of these arguments, morality requires that God&#x27;s existence is assumed, owing to practical reason. Rather than proving the existence of God, Kant was attempting to demonstrate that all moral thought requires the assumption that God exists. Kant argued that humans are obliged to bring about the &quot;summum bonum&quot;: the two central aims of moral virtue and happiness, where happiness arises out of virtue. As ought implies can, Kant argued, it must be possible for the &quot;summum bonum&quot; to be achieved. He accepted that it is not within the power of humans to bring the &quot;summum bonum&quot; about, because we cannot ensure that virtue always leads to happiness, so there must be a higher power who has the power to create an afterlife where virtue can be rewarded by happiness.

Philosopher G. H. R. Parkinson notes a common objection to Kant&#x27;s argument: that what ought to be done does not necessarily entail that it is possible. He also argues that alternative conceptions of morality exist which do not rely on the assumptions that Kant makes – he cites utilitarianism as an example which does not require the &quot;summum bonum&quot;. Nicholas Everitt argues that much moral guidance is unattainable, such as the Biblical command to be Christ-like. He proposes that Kant&#x27;s first two premises only entail that we must try to achieve the perfect good, not that it is actually attainable.

===Argument from objective moral truths===
Both theists and non-theists have accepted that the existence of objective moral truths might entail the existence of God. Atheist philosopher J. L. Mackie accepted that, if objective moral truths existed, they would warrant a supernatural explanation. Scottish philosopher W. R. Sorley presented the following argument:
#If morality is objective and absolute, God must exist.
#Morality is objective and absolute.
#Therefore, God must exist.

Many critics have challenged the second premise of this argument, by offering a biological and sociological account of the development of human morality which suggests that it is neither objective nor absolute. This account, supported by biologist E. O. Wilson and philosopher Michael Ruse, proposes that the human experience of morality is a by-product of natural selection, a theory philosopher Mark D. Linville calls evolutionary naturalism. According to the theory, the human experience of moral obligations was the result of evolutionary pressures, which attached a sense of morality to human psychology because it was useful for moral development; this entails that moral values do not exist independently of the human mind. Morality might be better understood as an evolutionary imperative in order to propagate genes and ultimately reproduce. No human society today advocates immorality, such as theft or murder, because it would undoubtedly lead to the end of that particular society and any chance for future survival of offspring. Scottish empiricist David Hume made a similar argument, that belief in objective moral truths is unwarranted and to discuss them is meaningless. 

Because evolutionary naturalism proposes an empirical account of morality, it does not require morality to exist objectively; Linville considers the view that this will lead to moral scepticism or antirealism. C. S. Lewis argued that, if evolutionary naturalism is accepted, human morality cannot be described as absolute and objective because moral statements cannot be right or wrong. Despite this, Lewis argued, those who accept evolutionary naturalism still act as if objective moral truths exist, leading Lewis to reject naturalism as incoherent. As an alternative ethical theory, Lewis offered a form of divine command theory which equated God with goodness and treated goodness as an essential part of reality, thus asserting God&#x27;s existence.

J. C. A. Gaskin challenges the first premise of the argument from moral objectivity, arguing that it must be shown why absolute and objective morality entails that morality is commanded by God, rather than simply a human invention. It could be the consent of humanity that gives it moral force, for example. American philosopher Michael Martin argues that it is not necessarily true that objective moral truths must entail the existence of God, suggesting that there could be alternative explanations: he argues that naturalism may be an acceptable explanation and, even if a supernatural explanation is necessary, it does not have to be God (polytheism is a viable alternative). Martin also argues that a non-objective account of ethics might be acceptable and challenges the view that a subjective account of morality would lead to moral anarchy.

William Lane Craig has argued for this form of the moral argument.

===Argument for conscience===

Related to the argument from morality is the argument from conscience, associated with eighteenth-century bishop Joseph Butler and nineteenth-century cardinal John Henry Newman. Newman proposed that the conscience, as well as giving moral guidance, provides evidence of objective moral truths which must be supported by the divine. He argued that emotivism is an inadequate explanation of the human experience of morality because people avoid acting immorally, even when it might be in their interests. Newman proposed that, to explain the conscience, God must exist.

British philosopher John Locke argued that moral rules cannot be established from conscience because the differences in people&#x27;s consciences would lead to contradictions. Locke also noted that the conscience is influenced by &quot;education, company, and customs of the country&quot;, a criticism mounted by J. L. Mackie, who argued that the conscience should be seen as an &quot;introjection&quot; of other people into an agent&#x27;s mind. Michael Martin challenges the argument from conscience with a naturalistic account of conscience, arguing that naturalism provides an adequate explanation for the conscience without the need for God&#x27;s existence. He uses the example of the internalization by humans of social pressures, which leads to the fear of going against these norms. Even if a supernatural cause is required, he argues, it could be something other than God; this would mean that the phenomenon of the conscience is no more supportive of monotheism than polytheism.

C. S. Lewis argues for the existence of God in a similar way in his book &quot;Mere Christianity&quot;, but he does not directly refer to it as the argument from morality.

<doc id="2006" wikidata="Q7341" url="?curid=2006" title="Auschwitz concentration camp">
<text>Auschwitz or Oświęcim, was a complex of over 40 concentration and extermination camps operated by Nazi Germany in occupied Poland (in a portion annexed into Germany in 1939) during World War II and the Holocaust. It consisted of Auschwitz I, the main camp (&quot;Stammlager&quot;) in Oświęcim; Auschwitz II-Birkenau, a concentration and extermination camp with gas chambers; Auschwitz III-Monowitz, a labour camp for the chemical conglomerate IG Farben; and dozens of subcamps. The camps became a major site of the Nazis&#x27; Final Solution to the Jewish question.

After Germany initiated World War II by invading Poland in September 1939, the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) converted Auschwitz I, an army barracks, into a prisoner-of-war camp. The initial transport of political detainees to Auschwitz consisted almost solely of Poles (for whom the camp was initially established). For the first two years, the majority of inmates were Polish. In May 1940, German criminals brought to the camp as functionaries established the camp&#x27;s reputation for sadism. Prisoners were beaten, tortured, and executed for the most trivial of reasons. The first gassings—of Soviet and Polish prisoners—took place in block 11 of Auschwitz I around August 1941.

Construction of Auschwitz II began the following month, and from 1942 until late 1944 freight trains delivered Jews from all over German-occupied Europe to its gas chambers. Of the 1.3 million people sent to Auschwitz, 1.1 million were murdered. The number of victims includes 960,000 Jews (865,000 of whom were gassed on arrival), 74,000 non-Jewish Poles, 21,000 Romani, 15,000 Soviet prisoners of war, and up to 15,000 others. Those not gassed were murdered via starvation, exhaustion, disease, individual executions, or beatings. Others were killed during medical experiments.

At least 802 prisoners tried to escape, 144 successfully, and on 7 October 1944, two &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; units, consisting of prisoners who operated the gas chambers, launched an unsuccessful uprising. After the Holocaust ended, only 789 Schutzstaffel personnel (no more than 15 percent) ever stood trial. Several were executed, including camp commandant Rudolf Höss. The Allies&#x27; failure to act on early reports of mass murder by bombing the camp or its railways remains controversial.

As the Soviet Red Army approached Auschwitz in January 1945, toward the end of the war, the SS sent most of the camp&#x27;s population west on a death march to camps inside Germany and Austria. Soviet troops entered the camp on 27 January 1945, a day commemorated since 2005 as International Holocaust Remembrance Day. In the decades after the war, survivors such as Primo Levi, Viktor Frankl, Elie Wiesel, and Edith Eger wrote memoirs of their experiences, and the camp became a dominant symbol of the Holocaust. In 1947, Poland founded the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum on the site of Auschwitz I and II, and in 1979 it was named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Auschwitz is the site of the largest mass murder in a single location in history.

==Background==

The ideology of Nazism combined elements of &quot;racial hygiene&quot;, eugenics, antisemitism, pan-Germanism, and territorial expansionism, Richard J. Evans writes. Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party became obsessed by the &quot;Jewish question&quot;. Both during and immediately after the Nazi seizure of power in Germany in 1933, acts of violence against German Jews became ubiquitous, and legislation was passed excluding them from certain professions, including the civil service and the law.

Harassment and economic pressure encouraged Jews to leave Germany; their businesses were denied access to markets, forbidden from advertising in newspapers, and deprived of government contracts. On 15 September 1935, the Reichstag passed the Nuremberg Laws. One, the Reich Citizenship Law, defined as citizens those of &quot;German or related blood who demonstrate by their behaviour that they are willing and suitable to serve the German People and Reich faithfully&quot;, and the Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honor prohibited marriage and extramarital relations between those with &quot;German or related blood&quot; and Jews.

When Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, triggering World War II, Hitler ordered that the Polish leadership and intelligentsia be destroyed. The area around Auschwitz was annexed to the German Reich, as part of first Gau Silesia and from 1941 Gau Upper Silesia. The camp at Auschwitz was established in April 1940, at first as a quarantine camp for Polish political prisoners. On 22 June 1941, in an attempt to obtain new territory, Hitler invaded the Soviet Union. The first gassing at Auschwitz—of a group of Soviet prisoners of war—took place around August 1941. By the end of that year, during what most historians regard as the first phase of the Holocaust, 500,000–800,000 Soviet Jews had been murdered in mass shootings by a combination of German &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot;, ordinary German soldiers, and local collaborators. At the Wannsee Conference in Berlin on 20 January 1942, Reinhard Heydrich outlined the Final Solution to the Jewish Question to senior Nazis, and from early 1942 freight trains delivered Jews from all over occupied Europe to German extermination camps in Poland: Auschwitz, Bełżec, Chełmno, Majdanek, Sobibór, and Treblinka. Most prisoners were gassed on arrival.

==Camps==
===Auschwitz I===
====Growth====

A former World War I camp for transient workers and later a Polish army barracks, Auschwitz I was the main camp (&quot;Stammlager&quot;) and administrative headquarters of the camp complex. southwest of Kraków, the site was first suggested in February 1940 as a quarantine camp for Polish prisoners by Arpad Wigand, the inspector of the Sicherheitspolizei (security police) and deputy of Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski, the Higher SS and Police Leader for Silesia. Richard Glücks, head of the Concentration Camps Inspectorate, sent Walter Eisfeld, former commandant of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp in Oranienburg, Germany, to inspect it. Around long and wide, Auschwitz consisted at the time of 22 brick buildings, eight of them two-story. A second story was added to the others in 1943 and eight new blocks were built.

Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, approved the site in April 1940 on the recommendation of SS-Obersturmbannführer Rudolf Höss of the camps inspectorate. Höss oversaw the development of the camp and served as its first commandant. The first 30 prisoners arrived on 20 May 1940 from the Sachsenhausen camp. German &quot;career criminals&quot; (&quot;Berufsverbrecher&quot;), the men were known as &quot;greens&quot; (&quot;Grünen&quot;) after the green triangles on their prison clothing. Brought to the camp as functionaries, this group did much to establish the sadism of early camp life, which was directed particularly at Polish inmates, until the political prisoners took over their roles. Bruno Brodniewicz, the first prisoner (who was given serial number 1), became &quot;Lagerälteste&quot; (camp elder). The others were given positions such as &quot;kapo&quot; and block supervisor.

====First mass transport====

The first mass transport—of 728 Polish male political prisoners, including Catholic priests and Jews—arrived on 14 June 1940 from Tarnów, Poland. They were given serial numbers 31 to 758. In a letter on 12 July 1940, Höss told Glücks that the local population was &quot;fanatically Polish, ready to undertake any sort of operation against the hated SS men&quot;. By the end of 1940, the SS had confiscated land around the camp to create a 40-square-kilometer (15 sq mi) &quot;zone of interest&quot; (&quot;Interessengebiet&quot;) patrolled by the SS, Gestapo and local police. By March 1941, 10,900 were imprisoned in the camp, most of them Poles.

An inmate&#x27;s first encounter with Auschwitz, if they were registered and not sent straight to the gas chamber, was at the prisoner reception centre near the gate with the sign, where they were tattooed, shaved, disinfected, and given a striped prison uniform. Built between 1942 and 1944, the center contained a bathhouse, laundry, and 19 gas chambers for delousing clothing. The prisoner reception center of Auschwitz I became the visitor reception center of the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum.

====Crematorium I, first gassings====
Construction of crematorium I began at Auschwitz I at the end of June or beginning of July 1940. Initially intended not for mass murder but for prisoners who had been executed or had otherwise died in the camp, the crematorium was in operation from August 1940 until July 1943, by which time the crematoria at Auschwitz II had taken over. By May 1942 three ovens had been installed in crematorium I, which together could burn 340 bodies in 24 hours.

The first experimental gassing took place around August 1941, when Lagerführer Karl Fritzsch, at the instruction of Rudolf Höss, murdered a group of Soviet prisoners of war by throwing Zyklon B crystals into their basement cell in block 11 of Auschwitz I. A second group of 600 Soviet prisoners of war and around 250 sick Polish prisoners were gassed on 3–5 September in the old crematorium after being told they were to march naked there to receive new clothing. The morgue was later converted to a gas chamber able to hold at least 700–800 people. Zyklon B was dropped into the room through slits in the ceiling.

====First mass transport of Jews====

Historians have disagreed about the date the all-Jewish transports began arriving in Auschwitz. At the Wannsee Conference in Berlin on 20 January 1942, the Nazi leadership outlined, in euphemistic language, its plans for the Final Solution. According to Franciszek Piper, the Auschwitz commandant Rudolf Höss offered inconsistent accounts after the war, suggesting the extermination began in December 1941, January 1942, or before the establishment of the women&#x27;s camp in March 1942. In &quot;Kommandant in Auschwitz&quot;, he wrote: &quot;In the spring of 1942 the first transports of Jews, all earmarked for extermination, arrived from Upper Silesia.&quot; On 15 February 1942, according to Danuta Czech, a transport of Jews from Beuthen, Upper Silesia (Bytom, Poland), arrived at Auschwitz I and was sent straight to the gas chamber. In 1998 an eyewitness said the train contained &quot;the women of Beuthen&quot;. Saul Friedländer wrote that the Beuthen Jews were from the Organization Schmelt labor camps and had been deemed unfit for work. According to Christopher Browning, transports of Jews unfit for work were sent to the gas chamber at Auschwitz from autumn 1941. The evidence for this and the February 1942 transport was contested in 2015 by Nikolaus Wachsmann.

Around 20 March 1942, according to Danuta Czech, a transport of Polish Jews from Silesia and Zagłębie Dąbrowskie was taken straight from the station to the Auschwitz II gas chamber, which had just come into operation. On 26 and 28 March, two transports of Slovakian Jews were registered as prisoners in the women&#x27;s camp, where they were kept for slave labour; these were the first transports organized by Adolf Eichmann&#x27;s department IV B4 (the Jewish office) in the Reich Security Head Office (RSHA). On 30 March the first RHSA transport arrived from France. &quot;Selection&quot;, where new arrivals were chosen for work or the gas chamber, began in April 1942 and was conducted regularly from July. Piper writes that this reflected Germany&#x27;s increasing need for labour. Those selected as unfit for work were gassed without being registered as prisoners.

There is also disagreement about how many were gassed in Auschwitz I. Perry Broad, an &quot;SS-Unterscharführer&quot;, wrote that &quot;transport after transport vanished in the Auschwitz [I] crematorium.&quot; In the view of Filip Müller, one of the Auschwitz I &quot;Sonderkommando&quot;, tens of thousands of Jews were murdered there from France, Holland, Slovakia, Upper Silesia, and Yugoslavia, and from the Theresienstadt, Ciechanow, and Grodno ghettos. Against this, Jean-Claude Pressac estimated that up to 10,000 people had been murdered in Auschwitz I. The last inmates gassed there, in December 1942, were around 400 members of the Auschwitz II &quot;Sonderkommando&quot;, who had been forced to dig up and burn the remains of that camp&#x27;s mass graves, thought to hold over 100,000 corpses.

===Auschwitz II-Birkenau===
====Construction====

After visiting Auschwitz I in March 1941, it appears that Himmler ordered that the camp be expanded, although Peter Hayes notes that, on 10 January 1941, the Polish underground told the Polish government-in-exile in London: &quot;the Auschwitz concentration camp ...can accommodate approximately 7,000 prisoners at present, and is to be rebuilt to hold approximately 30,000.&quot; Construction of Auschwitz II-Birkenau—called a &quot;Kriegsgefangenenlager&quot; (prisoner-of-war camp) on blueprints—began in October 1941 in Brzezinka, about three kilometers from Auschwitz I. The initial plan was that Auschwitz II would consist of four sectors (Bauabschnitte I–IV), each consisting of six subcamps (BIIa–BIIf) with their own gates and fences. The first two sectors were completed (sector BI was initially a quarantine camp), but the construction of BIII began in 1943 and stopped in April 1944, and the plan for BIV was abandoned.

SS-Sturmbannführer Karl Bischoff, an architect, was the chief of construction. Based on an initial budget of RM 8.9 million, his plans called for each barracks to hold 550 prisoners, but he later changed this to 744 per barracks, which meant the camp could hold 125,000, rather than 97,000. There were 174 barracks, each measuring , divided into 62 bays of . The bays were divided into &quot;roosts&quot;, initially for three inmates and later for four. With personal space of to sleep and place whatever belongings they had, inmates were deprived, Robert-Jan van Pelt wrote, &quot;of the minimum space needed to exist&quot;.

The prisoners were forced to live in the barracks as they were building them; in addition to working, they faced long roll calls at night. As a result, most prisoners in BIb (the men&#x27;s camp) in the early months died of hypothermia, starvation or exhaustion within a few weeks. Some 10,000 Soviet prisoners of war arrived at Auschwitz I between 7 and 25 October 1941, but by 1 March 1942 only 945 were still registered; they were transferred to Auschwitz II, where most of them had died by May.

====Crematoria II–V====

The first gas chamber at Auschwitz II was operational by March 1942. On or around 20 March, a transport of Polish Jews sent by the Gestapo from Silesia and Zagłębie Dąbrowskie was taken straight from the Oświęcim freight station to the Auschwitz II gas chamber, then buried in a nearby meadow. The gas chamber was located in what prisoners called the &quot;little red house&quot; (known as bunker 1 by the SS), a brick cottage that had been turned into a gassing facility; the windows had been bricked up and its four rooms converted into two insulated rooms, the doors of which said &quot;Zur Desinfektion&quot; (&quot;to disinfection&quot;). A second brick cottage, the &quot;little white house&quot; or bunker 2, was converted and operational by June 1942. When Himmler visited the camp on 17 and 18 July 1942, he was given a demonstration of a selection of Dutch Jews, a mass-murder in a gas chamber in bunker 2, and a tour of the building site of Auschwitz III, the new IG Farben plant being constructed at Monowitz. Use of bunkers I and 2 stopped in spring 1943 when the new crematoria were built, although bunker 2 became operational again in May 1944 for the murder of the Hungarian Jews. Bunker I was demolished in 1943 and bunker 2 in November 1944.

Plans for crematoria II and III show that both had an oven room on the ground floor, and an underground dressing room and gas chamber . The dressing rooms had wooden benches along the walls and numbered pegs for clothing. Victims would be led from these rooms to a five-yard-long narrow corridor, which in turn led to a space from which the gas chamber door opened. The chambers were white inside, and nozzles were fixed to the ceiling to resemble showerheads. The daily capacity of the crematoria (how many bodies could be burned in a 24-hour period) was 340 corpses in crematorium I; 1,440 each in crematoria II and III; and 768 each in IV and V. By June 1943 all four crematoria were operational, but crematorium I was not used after July 1943. This made the total daily capacity 4,416, although by loading three to five corpses at a time, the &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; were able to burn some 8,000 bodies a day. This maximum capacity was rarely needed; the average between 1942 and 1944 was 1,000 bodies burned every day.

===Auschwitz III–Monowitz===
After examining several sites for a new plant to manufacture Buna-N, a type of synthetic rubber essential to the war effort, the German chemical conglomerate IG Farben chose a site near the towns of Dwory and Monowice (Monowitz in German), about east of Auschwitz I. Tax exemptions were available to corporations prepared to develop industries in the frontier regions under the Eastern Fiscal Assistance Law, passed in December 1940. In addition to its proximity to the concentration camp, a source of cheap labour, the site had good railway connections and access to raw materials. In February 1941, Himmler ordered that the Jewish population of Oświęcim be expelled to make way for skilled laborers; that all Poles able to work remain in the town and work on building the factory; and that Auschwitz prisoners be used in the construction work.

Auschwitz inmates began working at the plant, known as Buna Werke and IG-Auschwitz, in April 1941, demolishing houses in Monowitz to make way for it. By May, because of a shortage of trucks, several hundred of them were rising at 3 am to walk there twice a day from Auschwitz I. Because a long line of exhausted inmates walking through the town of Oświęcim might harm German-Polish relations, the inmates were told to shave daily, make sure they were clean, and sing as they walked. From late July they were taken to the factory by train on freight wagons. Given the difficulty of moving them, including during the winter, IG Farben decided to build a camp at the plant. The first inmates moved there on 30 October 1942. Known as &quot;KL Auschwitz III–Aussenlager&quot; (Auschwitz III subcamp), and later as the Monowitz concentration camp, it was the first concentration camp to be financed and built by private industry.
Measuring , the camp was larger than Auschwitz I. By the end of 1944, it housed 60 barracks measuring , each with a day room and a sleeping room containing 56 three-tiered wooden bunks. IG Farben paid the SS three or four Reichsmark for nine- to eleven-hour shifts from each worker. In 1943–1944, about 35,000 inmates worked at the plant; 23,000 (32 a day on average) were killed through malnutrition, disease, and the workload. Within three to four months at the camp, Peter Hayes writes, the inmates were &quot;reduced to walking skeletons&quot;. Deaths and transfers to the gas chambers at Auschwitz II reduced the population by nearly a fifth each month. Site managers constantly threatened inmates with the gas chambers, and the smell from the crematoria at Auschwitz I and II hung heavy over the camp.

Although the factory had been expected to begin production in 1943, shortages of labour and raw materials meant start-up was postponed repeatedly. The Allies bombed the plant in 1944 on 20 August, 13 September, 18 December, and 26 December. On 19 January 1945, the SS ordered that the site be evacuated, sending 9,000 inmates, most of them Jews, on a death march to another Auschwitz subcamp at Gliwice. From Gliwice, prisoners were taken by rail in open freight wagons to the Buchenwald and Mauthausen concentration camps. The 800 inmates who had been left behind in the Monowitz hospital were liberated along with the rest of the camp on 27 January 1945 by the 1st Ukrainian Front of the Red Army.

===Subcamps===

Several other German industrial enterprises, such as Krupp and Siemens-Schuckert, built factories with their own subcamps. There were around 28 camps near industrial plants, each camp holding hundreds or thousands of prisoners. Designated as &quot;Aussenlager&quot; (external camp), &quot;Nebenlager&quot; (extension camp), &quot;Arbeitslager&quot; (labor camp), or &quot;Aussenkommando&quot; (external work detail), camps were built at Blechhammer, Jawiszowice, Jaworzno, Lagisze, Mysłowice, Trzebinia, and as far afield as the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia in Czechoslovakia. Industries with satellite camps included coal mines, foundries and other metal works, and chemical plants. Prisoners were also made to work in forestry and farming. For example, &quot;Wirtschaftshof Budy&quot;, in the Polish village of Budy near Brzeszcze, was a farming subcamp where prisoners worked 12-hour days in the fields, tending animals, and making compost by mixing human ashes from the crematoria with sod and manure. Incidents of sabotage to decrease production took place in several subcamps, including Charlottengrube, Gleiwitz II, and Rajsko. Living conditions in some of the camps were so poor that they were regarded as punishment subcamps.

==Life in the camps==
===SS garrison===
Rudolf Höss, born in Baden-Baden in 1901, was named the first commandant of Auschwitz when Heinrich Himmler ordered on 27 April 1940 that the camp be established. Living with his wife and children in a two-story stucco house near the commandant&#x27;s and administration building, he served as commandant until 11 November 1943, with Josef Kramer as his deputy. Succeeded as commandant by Arthur Liebehenschel, Höss joined the SS Business and Administration Head Office in Oranienburg as director of Amt DI, a post that made him deputy of the camps inspectorate.

Richard Baer became commandant of Auschwitz I on 11 May 1944 and Fritz Hartjenstein of Auschwitz II from 22 November 1943, followed by Josef Kramer from 15 May 1944 until the camp&#x27;s liquidation in January 1945. Heinrich Schwarz was commandant of Auschwitz III from the point at which it became an autonomous camp in November 1943 until its liquidation. Höss returned to Auschwitz between 8 May and 29 July 1944 as the local SS garrison commander (&quot;Standortältester&quot;) to oversee the arrival of Hungary&#x27;s Jews, which made him the superior officer of all the commandants of the Auschwitz camps.

According to Aleksander Lasik, about 6,335 people (6,161 of them men) worked for the SS at Auschwitz over the course of the camp&#x27;s existence; 4.2 percent were officers, 26.1 percent non-commissioned officers, and 69.7 percent rank and file. In March 1941, there were 700 SS guards; in June 1942, 2,000; and in August 1944, 3,342. At its peak in January 1945, 4,480 SS men and 71 SS women worked in Auschwitz; the higher number is probably attributable to the logistics of evacuating the camp. Female guards were known as SS supervisors (&quot;SS-Aufseherinnen&quot;).

Most of the staff were from Germany or Austria, but as the war progressed, increasing numbers of &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; from other countries, including Czechoslovakia, Poland, Yugoslavia, and the Baltic states, joined the SS at Auschwitz. Not all were ethnically German. Guards were also recruited from Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia. Camp guards, around three quarters of the SS personnel, were members of the &quot;SS-Totenkopfverbände&quot; (death&#x27;s head units). Other SS staff worked in the medical or political departments, or in the economic administration, which was responsible for clothing and other supplies, including the property of dead prisoners. The SS viewed Auschwitz as a comfortable posting; being there meant they had avoided the front and had access to the victims&#x27; property.

===Functionaries and &quot;Sonderkommando&quot;===

Certain prisoners, at first non-Jewish Germans but later Jews and non-Jewish Poles, were assigned positions of authority as &quot;Funktionshäftlinge&quot; (functionaries), which gave them access to better housing and food. The &quot;Lagerprominenz&quot; (camp elite) included &quot;Blockschreiber&quot; (barracks clerk), &quot;Kapo&quot; (overseer), &quot;Stubendienst&quot; (barracks orderly), and &quot;Kommandierte&quot; (trusties). Wielding tremendous power over other prisoners, the functionaries developed a reputation as sadists. Very few were prosecuted after the war, because of the difficulty of determining which atrocities had been performed by order of the SS.

Although the SS oversaw the murders at each gas chamber, the forced labor portion of the work was done by prisoners known from 1942 as the &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; (special squad). These were mostly Jews but they included groups such as Soviet POWs. In 1940–1941 when there was one gas chamber, there were 20 such prisoners, in late 1943 there were 400, and by 1944 during the Holocaust in Hungary the number had risen to 874. The &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; removed goods and corpses from the incoming trains, guided victims to the dressing rooms and gas chambers, removed their bodies afterwards, and took their jewelry, hair, dental work, and any precious metals from their teeth, all of which was sent to Germany. Once the bodies were stripped of anything valuable, the &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; burned them in the crematoria.

Because they were witnesses to the mass murder, the &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; lived separately from the other prisoners, although this rule was not applied to the non-Jews among them. Their quality of life was further improved by their access to the property of new arrivals, which they traded within the camp, including with the SS. Nevertheless, their life expectancy was short; they were regularly murdered and replaced. About 100 survived to the camp&#x27;s liquidation. They were forced on a death march and by train to the camp at Mauthausen, where three days later they were asked to step forward during roll call. No one did, and because the SS did not have their records, several of them survived.

===Tattoos and triangles===
Uniquely at Auschwitz, prisoners were tattooed with a serial number, on their left breast for Soviet prisoners of war and on the left arm for civilians. Categories of prisoner were distinguishable by triangular pieces of cloth (German: &quot;Winkel&quot;) sewn onto on their jackets below their prisoner number. Political prisoners &quot;(Schutzhäftlinge&quot; or Sch), mostly Poles, had a red triangle, while criminals (&quot;Berufsverbrecher&quot; or BV) were mostly German and wore green. Asocial prisoners (&quot;Asoziale&quot; or Aso), which included vagrants, prostitutes and the Roma, wore black. Purple was for Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses (&quot;Internationale Bibelforscher-Vereinigung&quot; or IBV)&#x27;s and pink for gay men, who were mostly German. An estimated 5,000–15,000 gay men prosecuted under German Penal Code Section 175 (proscribing sexual acts between men) were detained in concentration camps, of whom an unknown number were sent to Auschwitz. Jews wore a yellow badge, the shape of the Star of David, overlaid by a second triangle if they also belonged to a second category. The nationality of the inmate was indicated by a letter stitched onto the cloth. A racial hierarchy existed, with German prisoners at the top. Next were non-Jewish prisoners from other countries. Jewish prisoners were at the bottom.

===Transports===

Deportees were brought to Auschwitz crammed in wretched conditions into goods or cattle wagons, arriving near a railway station or at one of several dedicated trackside ramps, including one next to Auschwitz I. The &quot;Altejudenrampe&quot; (old Jewish ramp), part of the Oświęcim freight railway station, was used from 1942 to 1944 for Jewish transports. Located between Auschwitz I and Auschwitz II, arriving at this ramp meant a 2.5 km journey to Auschwitz II and the gas chambers. Most deportees were forced to walk, accompanied by SS men and a car with a Red Cross symbol that carried the Zyklon B, as well as an SS doctor in case officers were poisoned by mistake. Inmates arriving at night, or who were too weak to walk, were taken by truck. Work on a new railway line and ramp &quot;(right)&quot; between sectors BI and BII in Auschwitz II, was completed in May 1944 for the arrival of Hungarian Jews between May and early July 1944. The rails led directly to the area around the gas chambers.

===Life for the inmates===
The day began at 4:30 am for the men (an hour later in winter), and earlier for the women, when the block supervisor sounded a gong and started beating inmates with sticks to make them wash and use the latrines quickly. There were few latrines and there was a lack of clean water. Each washhouse had to service thousands of prisoners. In sectors BIa and BIb in Auschwitz II, two buildings containing latrines and washrooms were installed in 1943. These contained troughs for washing and 90 faucets; the toilet facilities were &quot;sewage channels&quot; covered by concrete with 58 holes for seating. There were three barracks with washing facilities or toilets to serve 16 residential barracks in BIIa, and six washrooms/latrines for 32 barracks in BIIb, BIIc, BIId, and BIIe. Primo Levi described a 1944 Auschwitz III washroom:


Prisoners received half a litre of coffee substitute or a herbal tea in the morning, but no food. A second gong heralded roll call, when inmates lined up outside in rows of ten to be counted. No matter the weather, they had to wait for the SS to arrive for the count; how long they stood there depended on the officers&#x27; mood, and whether there had been escapes or other events attracting punishment. Guards might force the prisoners to squat for an hour with their hands above their heads or hand out beatings or detention for infractions such as having a missing button or an improperly cleaned food bowl. The inmates were counted and re-counted.
After roll call, to the sound of &quot;Arbeitskommandos formieren&quot; (&quot;form work details&quot;), prisoners walked to their place of work, five abreast, to begin a working day that was normally 11 hours long—longer in summer and shorter in winter. A prison orchestra, such as the Women&#x27;s Orchestra of Auschwitz, was forced to play cheerful music as the workers left the camp. &quot;Kapos&quot; were responsible for the prisoners&#x27; behaviour while they worked, as was an SS escort. Much of the work took place outdoors at construction sites, gravel pits, and lumber yards. No rest periods were allowed. One prisoner was assigned to the latrines to measure the time the workers took to empty their bladders and bowels.

Lunch was three-quarters of a litre of watery soup at midday, reportedly foul-tasting, with meat in the soup four times a week and vegetables (mostly potatoes and rutabaga) three times. The evening meal was 300 grams of bread, often moldy, part of which the inmates were expected to keep for breakfast the next day, with a tablespoon of cheese or marmalade, or 25 grams of margarine or sausage. Prisoners engaged in hard labour were given extra rations.

A second roll call took place at seven in the evening, in the course of which prisoners might be hanged or flogged. If a prisoner was missing, the others had to remain standing until the absentee was found or the reason for the absence discovered, even if it took hours. On 6 July 1940, roll call lasted 19 hours because a Polish prisoner, Tadeusz Wiejowski, had escaped; following an escape in 1941, a group of prisoners was picked out from the escapee&#x27;s barracks and sent to block 11 to be starved to death. After roll call, prisoners retired to their blocks for the night and received their bread rations. Then they had some free time to use the washrooms and receive their mail, unless they were Jews: Jews were not allowed to receive mail. Curfew (&quot;nighttime quiet&quot;) was marked by a gong at nine o&#x27;clock. Inmates slept in long rows of brick or wooden bunks, or on the floor, lying in and on their clothes and shoes to prevent them from being stolen. The wooden bunks had blankets and paper mattresses filled with wood shavings; in the brick barracks, inmates lay on straw. According to Miklós Nyiszli:
Sunday was not a workday, but prisoners had to clean the barracks and take their weekly shower, and were allowed to write (in German) to their families, although the SS censored the mail. Inmates who did not speak German would trade bread for help. Observant Jews tried to keep track of the Hebrew calendar and Jewish holidays, including Shabbat, and the weekly Torah portion. No watches, calendars, or clocks were permitted in the camp. Only two Jewish calendars made in Auschwitz survived to the end of the war. Prisoners kept track of the days in other ways, such as obtaining information from newcomers.

===Women&#x27;s camp===
About 30 percent of the registered inmates were female. The first mass transport of women, 999 non-Jewish German women from the Ravensbrück concentration camp, arrived on 26 March 1942. Classified as criminal, asocial and political, they were brought to Auschwitz as founder functionaries of the women&#x27;s camp. Rudolf Höss wrote of them: &quot;It was easy to predict that these beasts would mistreat the women over whom they exercised power ... Spiritual suffering was completely alien to them.&quot; They were given serial numbers 1–999. The women&#x27;s guard from Ravensbrück, Johanna Langefeld, became the first Auschwitz women&#x27;s camp &quot;Lagerführerin&quot;. A second mass transport of women, 999 Jews from Poprad, Slovakia, arrived on the same day. According to Danuta Czech, this was the first registered transport sent to Auschwitz by the Reich Security Head Office (RSHA) office IV B4, known as the Jewish Office, led by SS &quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot; Adolf Eichmann. (Office IV was the Gestapo.) A third transport of 798 Jewish women from Bratislava, Slovakia, followed on 28 March.

Women were at first held in blocks 1–10 of Auschwitz I, but from 6 August 1942, 13,000 inmates were transferred to a new women&#x27;s camp (&quot;Frauenkonzentrationslager&quot; or FKL) in Auschwitz II. This consisted at first of 15 brick and 15 wooden barracks in sector (&quot;Bauabschnitt&quot;) BIa; it was later extended into BIb, and by October 1943 it held 32,066 women. In 1943–1944, about 11,000 women were also housed in the Gypsy family camp, as were several thousand in the Theresienstadt family camp.

Conditions in the women&#x27;s camp were so poor that when a group of male prisoners arrived to set up an infirmary in October 1942, their first task, according to researchers from the Auschwitz Museum, was to distinguish the corpses from the women who were still alive. Gisella Perl, a Romanian-Jewish gynecologist and inmate of the women&#x27;s camp, wrote in 1948:
Langefeld was succeeded as &quot;Lagerführerin&quot; in October 1942 by SS &quot;Oberaufseherin&quot; Maria Mandl, who developed a reputation for cruelty. Höss hired men to oversee the female supervisors, first SS &quot;Obersturmführer&quot; Paul Müller, then SS &quot;Hauptsturmführer&quot; Franz Hössler. Mandl and Hössler were executed after the war. Sterilisation experiments were carried out in barracks 30 by a German gynecologist, Carl Clauberg, and another German doctor, Horst Schumann.

===Medical experiments, block 10===

German doctors performed a variety of experiments on prisoners at Auschwitz. SS doctors tested the efficacy of X-rays as a sterilization device by administering large doses to female prisoners. Carl Clauberg injected chemicals into women&#x27;s uteruses in an effort to glue them shut. Prisoners were infected with spotted fever for vaccination research and exposed to toxic substances to study the effects. In one experiment, Bayer—then part of IG Farben—paid RM 150 each for 150 female inmates from Auschwitz (the camp had asked for RM 200 per woman), who were transferred to a Bayer facility to test an anesthetic. A Bayer employee wrote to Rudolf Höss: &quot;The transport of 150 women arrived in good condition. However, we were unable to obtain conclusive results because they died during the experiments. We would kindly request that you send us another group of women to the same number and at the same price.&quot; The Bayer research was led at Auschwitz by Helmuth Vetter of Bayer/IG Farben, who was also an Auschwitz physician and SS captain, and by Auschwitz physicians Friedrich Entress and Eduard Wirths.
The most infamous doctor at Auschwitz was Josef Mengele, the &quot;Angel of Death&quot;, who worked in Auschwitz II from 30 May 1943, at first in the gypsy family camp. Interested in performing research on identical twins, dwarfs, and those with hereditary disease, Mengele set up a kindergarten in barracks 29 and 31 for children he was experimenting on, and for all Romani children under six, where they were given better food rations. From May 1944, he would select twins and dwarfs from among the new arrivals during &quot;selection&quot;, reportedly calling for twins with &quot;Zwillinge heraus!&quot; (&quot;twins step forward!&quot;). He and other doctors (the latter prisoners) would measure the twins&#x27; body parts, photograph them, and subject them to dental, sight and hearing tests, x-rays, blood tests, surgery, and blood transfusions between them. Then he would have them killed and dissected. Kurt Heissmeyer, another German doctor and SS officer, took 20 Polish Jewish children from Auschwitz to use in pseudoscientific experiments at the Neuengamme concentration camp near Hamburg, where he injected them with the tuberculosis bacilli to test a cure for tuberculosis. In April 1945, the children were murdered by hanging to conceal the project.

A Jewish skeleton collection was obtained from among a pool of 115 Jewish inmates, chosen for their perceived stereotypical racial characteristics. Rudolf Brandt and Wolfram Sievers, general manager of the &quot;Ahnenerbe&quot; (a Nazi research institute), delivered the skeletons to the collection of the Anatomy Institute at the Reichsuniversität Straßburg in Alsace-Lorraine. The collection was sanctioned by Heinrich Himmler and under the direction of August Hirt. Ultimately 87 of the inmates were shipped to Natzweiler-Struthof and murdered in August 1943. Brandt and Sievers were executed in 1948 after being convicted during the Doctors&#x27; trial, part of the Subsequent Nuremberg trials.

===Punishment, block 11===
Prisoners could be beaten and killed by guards and &quot;kapos&quot; for the slightest infraction of the rules. Polish historian Irena Strzelecka writes that &quot;kapos&quot; were given nicknames that reflected their sadism: &quot;Bloody&quot;, &quot;Iron&quot;, &quot;The Strangler&quot;, &quot;The Boxer&quot;. Based on the 275 extant reports of punishment in the Auschwitz archives, Strzelecka lists common infractions: returning a second time for food at mealtimes, removing one&#x27;s gold teeth to buy bread, breaking into the pigsty to steal the pigs&#x27; food, putting one&#x27;s hands into one&#x27;s pockets.

Flogging during rollcall was common. A flogging table called &quot;the goat&quot; immobilised prisoners&#x27; feet in a box, while they stretched themselves across the table. Prisoners had to count out the lashes—&quot;25 mit besten Dank habe ich erhalten&quot; (&quot;25 received with many thanks&quot;)— and if they got the figure wrong, the flogging resumed from the beginning. Punishment by &quot;the post&quot; involved tying prisoners&#x27; hands behind their backs with chains attached to hooks, then raising the chains so the prisoners were left dangling by the wrists. If their shoulders were too damaged afterwards to work, they might be sent to the gas chamber. Prisoners were subjected to the post for helping a prisoner who had been beaten, and for picking up a cigarette butt. To extract information from inmates, guards would force their heads onto the stove, and hold them there, burning their faces and eyes.

Known as block 13 until 1941, block 11 of Auschwitz I was the prison within the prison, reserved for inmates suspected of resistance activities. Cell 22 in block 11 was a windowless standing cell (&quot;Stehbunker&quot;). Split into four sections, each section measured less than and held four prisoners, who entered it through a hatch near the floor. There was a vent for air, covered by a perforated sheet. Strzelecka writes that prisoners might have to spend several nights in cell 22; Wiesław Kielar spent four weeks in it for breaking a pipe. Several rooms in block 11 were deemed the &quot;Polizei-Ersatz-Gefängnis Myslowitz in Auschwitz&quot; (Auschwitz branch of the police station at Mysłowice). There were also &quot;Sonderbehandlung&quot; cases (&quot;special treatment&quot;) for Poles and others regarded as dangerous to Nazi Germany.

===Death wall===

The courtyard between blocks 10 and 11, known as the &quot;death wall&quot;, served as an execution area, including for Poles in the General Government area who had been sentenced to death by a criminal court. The first executions, by shooting inmates in the back of the head, took place at the death wall on 11 November 1941, Poland&#x27;s National Independence Day. The 151 accused were led to the wall one at a time, stripped naked and with their hands tied behind their backs. Danuta Czech noted that a &quot;clandestine Catholic mass&quot; was said the following Sunday on the second floor of Block 4 in Auschwitz I, in a narrow space between bunks.

An estimated 4,500 Polish political prisoners were executed at the death wall, including members of the camp resistance. An additional 10,000 Poles were brought to the camp to be executed without being registered. About 1,000 Soviet prisoners of war died by execution, although this is a rough estimate. A Polish government-in-exile report stated that 11,274 prisoners and 6,314 prisoners of war had been executed. Rudolf Höss wrote that &quot;execution orders arrived in an unbroken stream&quot;. According to SS officer Perry Broad, &quot;[s]ome of these walking skeletons had spent months in the stinking cells, where not even animals would be kept, and they could barely manage to stand straight. And yet, at that last moment, many of them shouted &#x27;Long live Poland&#x27;, or &#x27;Long live freedom&#x27;.&quot; The dead included Colonel Jan Karcz and Major Edward Gött-Getyński, executed on 25 January 1943 with 51 others suspected of resistance activities. Józef Noji, the Polish long-distance runner, was executed on 15 February that year. In October 1944, 200 &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; were executed for their part in the &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; revolt. 

===Family camps===
====Gypsy family camp====
A separate camp for the Roma, the &quot;Zigeunerfamilienlager&quot; (&quot;Gypsy family camp&quot;), was set up in the BIIe sector of Auschwitz II-Birkenau in February 1943. For unknown reasons, they were not subject to selection and families were allowed to stay together. The first transport of German Roma arrived on 26 February that year. There had been a small number of Romani inmates before that; two Czech Romani prisoners, Ignatz and Frank Denhel, tried to escape in December 1942, the latter successfully, and a Polish Romani woman, Stefania Ciuron, arrived on 12 February 1943 and escaped in April. Josef Mengele, the Holocaust&#x27;s most infamous physician, worked in the gypsy family camp from 30 May 1943 when he began his work in Auschwitz.

The Auschwitz registry (&quot;Hauptbücher&quot;) shows that 20,946 Roma were registered prisoners, and another 3,000 are thought to have entered unregistered. On 22 March 1943, one transport of 1,700 Polish Sinti and Roma was gassed on arrival because of illness, as was a second group of 1,035 on 25 May 1943. The SS tried to liquidate the camp on 16 May 1944, but the Roma fought them, armed with knives and iron pipes, and the SS retreated. Shortly after this, the SS removed nearly 2,908 from the family camp to work, and on 2 August 1944 gassed the other 2,897. Ten thousand remain unaccounted for.

====Theresienstadt family camp====

The SS deported around 18,000 Jews to Auschwitz from the Theresienstadt ghetto in Terezin, Czechoslovakia, beginning on 8 September 1943 with a transport of 2,293 male and 2,713 female prisoners. Placed in sector BIIb as a &quot;family camp&quot;, they were allowed to keep their belongings, wear their own clothes, and write letters to family; they did not have their hair shaved and were not subjected to selection. Correspondence between Adolf Eichmann&#x27;s office and the International Red Cross suggests that the Germans set up the camp to cast doubt on reports, in time for a planned Red Cross visit to Auschwitz, that mass murder was taking place there. The women and girls were placed in odd-numbered barracks and the men and boys in even-numbered. An infirmary was set up in barracks 30 and 32, and barracks 31 became a school and kindergarten. The somewhat better living conditions were nevertheless inadequate; 1,000 members of the family camp were dead within six months. Two other groups of 2,491 and 2,473 Jews arrived from Theresienstadt in the family camp on 16 and 20 December 1943.

On 8 March 1944, 3,791 of the prisoners (men, women and children) were sent to the gas chambers; the men were taken to crematorium III and the women later to crematorium II. Some of the groups were reported to have sung Hatikvah and the Czech national anthem on the way. Before they were murdered, they had been asked to write postcards to relatives, postdated to 25–27 March. Several twins were held back for medical experiments. The Czechoslovak government-in-exile initiated diplomatic manoeuvers to save the remaining Czech Jews after its representative in Bern received the Vrba-Wetzler report, written by two escaped prisoners, Rudolf Vrba and Alfred Wetzler, which warned that the remaining family-camp inmates would be gassed soon. The BBC also became aware of the report; its German service broadcast news of the family-camp murders during its women&#x27;s programme on 16 June 1944, warning: &quot;All those responsible for such massacres from top downwards will be called to account.&quot; The Red Cross visited Theresienstadt in June 1944 and were persuaded by the SS that no one was being deported from there. The following month, about 2,000 women from the family camp were selected to be moved to other camps and 80 boys were moved to the men&#x27;s camp; the remaining 7,000 were gassed between 10 and 12 July.

==Selection and extermination process==
===Gas chambers===

The first gassings at Auschwitz took place on September 3, 1941, when around 850 inmates—Soviet prisoners of war and sick Polish inmates—were killed with Zyklon B in the basement of block 11 in Auschwitz I. The building proved unsuitable, so gassings were conducted instead in crematorium I, also in Auschwitz I, which operated until December 1942. There, more than 700 victims could be killed at once. Tens of thousands were killed in crematorium I. To keep the victims calm, they were told they were to undergo disinfection and de-lousing; they were ordered to undress outside, then were locked in the building and gassed. After its decommissioning as a gas chamber, the building was converted to a storage facility and later served as an SS air raid shelter. The gas chamber and crematorium were reconstructed after the war. Dwork and van Pelt write that a chimney was recreated; four openings in the roof were installed to show where the Zyklon B had entered; and two of the three furnaces were rebuilt with the original components.
In early 1942, mass exterminations were moved to two provisional gas chambers (the &quot;red house&quot; and &quot;white house&quot;, known as bunkers 1 and 2) in Auschwitz II, while the larger crematoria (II, III, IV, and V) were under construction. Bunker 2 was temporarily reactivated from May to November 1944, when large numbers of Hungarian Jews were gassed. In summer 1944 the combined capacity of the crematoria and outdoor incineration pits was 20,000 bodies per day. A planned sixth facility—crematorium VI—was never built.

From 1942, Jews were being transported to Auschwitz from all over German-occupied Europe by rail, arriving in daily convoys. The gas chambers worked to their fullest capacity from May to July 1944, during the Holocaust in Hungary. A rail spur leading to crematoria II and III in Auschwitz II was completed that May, and a new ramp was built between sectors BI and BII to deliver the victims closer to the gas chambers (images top right). On 29 April the first 1,800 Jews from Hungary arrived at the camp. From 14 May until early July 1944, 437,000 Hungarian Jews, half the pre-war population, were deported to Auschwitz, at a rate of 12,000 a day for a considerable part of that period. The crematoria had to be overhauled. Crematoria II and III were given new elevators leading from the stoves to the gas chambers, new grates were fitted, and several of the dressing rooms and gas chambers were painted. Cremation pits were dug behind crematorium V. The incoming volume was so great that the &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; resorted to burning corpses in open-air pits as well as in the crematoria.

===Selection===
According to Polish historian Franciszek Piper, of the 1,095,000 Jews deported to Auschwitz, around 205,000 were registered in the camp and given serial numbers; 25,000 were sent to other camps; and 865,000 were murdered soon after arrival. Adding non-Jewish victims gives a figure of 900,000 who were murdered without being registered.

During &quot;selection&quot; on arrival, those deemed able to work were sent to the right and admitted into the camp (registered), and the rest were sent to the left to be gassed. The group selected to die included almost all children, women with small children, the elderly, and others who appeared on brief and superficial inspection by an SS doctor not to be fit for work. Practically any fault—scars, bandages, boils and emaciation—might provide reason enough to be deemed unfit. Children might be made to walk toward a stick held at a certain height; those who could walk under it were selected for the gas. Inmates unable to walk or who arrived at night were taken to the crematoria on trucks; otherwise, the new arrivals were marched there. Their belongings were seized and sorted by inmates in the &quot;Kanada&quot; warehouses, an area of the camp in sector BIIg that housed 30 barracks used as storage facilities for plundered goods; it derived its name from the inmates&#x27; view of Canada as a land of plenty.

===Inside the crematoria===

The crematoria consisted of a dressing room, gas chamber, and furnace room. In crematoria II and III, the dressing room and gas chamber were underground; in IV and V, they were on the ground floor. The dressing room had numbered hooks on the wall to hang clothes. In crematorium II, there was also a dissection room (&quot;Sezierraum&quot;). SS officers told the victims they had to take a shower and undergo delousing. The victims undressed in the dressing room and walked into the gas chamber; signs said &quot;Bade&quot; (bath) or &quot;Desinfektionsraum&quot; (disinfection room). A former prisoner testified that the language of the signs changed depending on who was being killed. Some inmates were given soap and a towel. A gas chamber could hold up to 2,000; one former prisoner said it was around 3,000.

The Zyklon B was delivered to the crematoria by a special SS bureau known as the Hygiene Institute. After the doors were shut, SS men dumped in the Zyklon B pellets through vents in the roof or holes in the side of the chamber. The victims were usually dead within 10 minutes; Rudolf Höss testified that it took up to 20 minutes. Leib Langfus, a member of the &quot;Sonderkommando&quot;, buried his diary (written in Yiddish) near crematorium III in Auschwitz II. It was found in 1952, signed &quot;A.Y.R.A&quot;:
===Use of corpses===

&quot;Sonderkommando&quot; wearing gas masks dragged the bodies from the chamber. They removed glasses and artificial limbs and shaved off the women&#x27;s hair; women&#x27;s hair was removed before they entered the gas chamber at Bełżec, Sobibór, and Treblinka, but at Auschwitz it was done after death. By 6 February 1943, the Reich Economic Ministry had received 3,000 kg of women&#x27;s hair from Auschwitz and Majdanek. The hair was first cleaned in a solution of sal ammoniac, dried on the brick floor of the crematoria, combed, and placed in paper bags. The hair was shipped to various companies, including one manufacturing plant in Bremen-Bluementhal, where workers found tiny coins with Greek letters on some of the braids, possibly from some of the 50,000 Greek Jews deported to Auschwitz in 1943. When they liberated the camp in January 1945, the Red Army found 7,000 kg of human hair in bags ready to ship.

Just before cremation, jewelry was removed, along with dental work and teeth containing precious metals. Gold was removed from the teeth of dead prisoners from 23 September 1940 onwards by order of Heinrich Himmler. The work was carried out by members of the &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; who were dentists; anyone overlooking dental work might themselves be cremated alive. The gold was sent to the SS Health Service and used by dentists to treat the SS and their families; 50 kg had been collected by 8 October 1942. By early 1944, 10–12 kg of gold was being extracted monthly from victims&#x27; teeth.

The corpses were burned in the nearby incinerators, and the ashes were buried, thrown in the Vistula river, or used as fertilizer. Any bits of bone that had not burned properly were ground down in wooden mortars.

===Death toll===

At least 1.3 million people were sent to Auschwitz between 1940 and 1945, and at least 1.1 million died. Overall 400,207 prisoners were registered in the camp: 268,657 male and 131,560 female. A study in the late 1980s by Polish historian Franciszek Piper, published by Yad Vashem in 1991, used timetables of train arrivals combined with deportation records to calculate that, of the 1.3 million sent to the camp, 1,082,000 had died there, a figure (rounded up to 1.1 million) that Piper regarded as a minimum. That figure came to be widely accepted.

The Germans tried to conceal how many they had murdered. In July 1942, according to Rudolf Höss&#x27;s post-war memoir, Höss received an order from Heinrich Himmler, via Adolf Eichmann&#x27;s office and SS commander Paul Blobel, that &quot;[a]ll mass graves were to be opened and the corpses burned. In addition, the ashes were to be disposed of in such a way that it would be impossible at some future time to calculate the number of corpses burned.&quot;

Earlier estimates of the death toll were higher than Piper&#x27;s. Following the camp&#x27;s liberation, the Soviet government issued a statement, on 8 May 1945, that four million people had been murdered on the site, a figure based on the capacity of the crematoria. Höss told prosecutors at Nuremberg that at least 2,500,000 people had been gassed there, and that another 500,000 had died of starvation and disease. He testified that the figure of over two million had come from Eichmann. In his memoirs, written in custody, Höss wrote that Eichmann had given the figure of 2.5 million to Höss&#x27;s superior officer Richard Glücks, based on records that had been destroyed. Höss regarded this figure as &quot;far too high. Even Auschwitz had limits to its destructive possibilities,&quot; he wrote.

Around one in six Jews murdered in the Holocaust died in Auschwitz. By nation, the greatest number of Auschwitz&#x27;s Jewish victims originated from Hungary, accounting for 430,000 deaths, followed by Poland (300,000), France (69,000), Netherlands (60,000), Greece (55,000), Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (46,000), Slovakia (27,000), Belgium (25,000), Germany and Austria (23,000), Yugoslavia (10,000), Italy (7,500), Norway (690), and others (34,000). Timothy Snyder writes that fewer than one percent of the million Soviet Jews murdered in the Holocaust were murdered in Auschwitz. Of the at least 387 Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses who were imprisoned at Auschwitz, 132 died in the camp.

==Resistance, escapes, and liberation==
===Camp resistance, flow of information===
Information about Auschwitz became available to the Allies as a result of reports by Captain Witold Pilecki of the Polish Home Army who, as &quot;Tomasz Serafiński&quot; (serial number 4859), allowed himself to be arrested in Warsaw and taken to Auschwitz. He was imprisoned there from 22 September 1940 until his escape on 27 April 1943. Michael Fleming writes that Pilecki was instructed to sustain morale, organize food, clothing and resistance, prepare to take over the camp if possible, and smuggle information out to the Polish military. Pilecki called his resistance movement Związek Organizacji Wojskowej (ZOW, &quot;Union of Military Organization&quot;).
The resistance sent out the first oral message about Auschwitz with Aleksander Wielkopolski, a Polish engineer who was released in October 1940. The following month the Polish underground in Warsaw prepared a report on the basis of that information, &quot;The camp in Auschwitz&quot;, part of which was published in London in May 1941 in a booklet, &quot;The German Occupation of Poland&quot;, by the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The report said of the Jews in the camp that &quot;scarcely any of them came out alive&quot;. According to Fleming, the booklet was &quot;widely circulated amongst British officials&quot;. The &quot;Polish Fortnightly Review&quot; based a story on it, writing that &quot;three crematorium furnaces were insufficient to cope with the bodies being cremated&quot;, as did &quot;The Scotsman&quot; on 8 January 1942, the only British news organization to do so.

On 24 December 1941, the resistance groups representing the various prisoner factions met in block 45 and agreed to cooperate. Fleming writes that it has not been possible to track Pilecki&#x27;s early intelligence from the camp. Pilecki compiled two reports after he escaped in April 1943; the second, Raport W, detailed his life in Auschwitz I and estimated that 1.5 million people, mostly Jews, had been murdered. On 1 July 1942, the &quot;Polish Fortnightly Review&quot; published a report describing Birkenau, writing that &quot;prisoners call this supplementary camp &#x27;Paradisal&#x27;, presumably because there is only one road, leading to Paradise&quot;. Reporting that inmates were being killed &quot;through excessive work, torture and medical means&quot;, it noted the gassing of the Soviet prisoners of war and Polish inmates in Auschwitz I in September 1941, the first gassing in the camp. It said: &quot;It is estimated that the Oswiecim camp can accommodate fifteen thousand prisoners, but as they die on a mass scale there is always room for new arrivals.&quot;
The Polish government-in-exile in London first reported the gassing of prisoners in Auschwitz on 21 July 1942, and reported the gassing of Soviet POWs and Jews on 4 September 1942. In 1943, the &quot;Kampfgruppe Auschwitz&quot; (Combat Group Auschwitz) was organized within the camp with the aim of sending out information about what was happening. The &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; buried notes in the ground, hoping they would be found by the camp&#x27;s liberators. The group also smuggled out photographs; the &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; photographs, of events around the gas chambers in Auschwitz II, were smuggled out of the camp in September 1944 in a toothpaste tube.

According to Fleming, the British press responded, in 1943 and the first half of 1944, either by not publishing reports about Auschwitz or by burying them on the inside pages. The exception was the &quot;Polish Jewish Observer&quot;, a &quot;City and East London Observer&quot; supplement edited by Joel Cang, a former Warsaw correspondent for the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;. The British reticence stemmed from a Foreign Office concern that the public might pressure the government to respond or provide refuge for the Jews, and that British actions on behalf of the Jews might affect its relationships in the Middle East. There was similar reticence in the United States, and indeed within the Polish government-in-exile and the Polish resistance. According to Fleming, the scholarship suggests that the Polish resistance distributed information about the Holocaust in Auschwitz without challenging the Allies&#x27; reluctance to highlight it.

===Escapes, &quot;Auschwitz Protocols&quot;===
From the first escape on 6 July 1940 of Tadeusz Wiejowski, at least 802 prisoners (757 men and 45 women) tried to escape from the camp, according to Polish historian Henryk Świebocki. He writes that most escapes were attempted from work sites outside the camp&#x27;s perimeter fence. Of the 802 escapes, 144 were successful, 327 were caught, and the fate of 331 is unknown.

Four Polish prisoners— (serial number 8502), Kazimierz Piechowski (no. 918), Stanisław Gustaw Jaster (no. 6438), and Józef Lempart (no. 3419)—escaped successfully on 20 June 1942. After breaking into a warehouse, three of them dressed as SS officers and stole rifles and an SS staff car, which they drove out of the camp with the fourth handcuffed as a prisoner. They wrote later to Rudolf Höss apologizing for the loss of the vehicle. On 21 July 1944, Polish inmate Jerzy Bielecki dressed in an SS uniform and, using a faked pass, managed to cross the camp&#x27;s gate with his Jewish girlfriend, Cyla Cybulska, pretending that she was wanted for questioning. Both survived the war. For having saved her, Bielecki was recognized by Yad Vashem as Righteous Among the Nations.

Jerzy Tabeau (no. 27273, registered as Jerzy Wesołowski) and Roman Cieliczko (no. 27089), both Polish prisoners, escaped on 19 November 1943; Tabeau made contact with the Polish underground and, between December 1943 and early 1944, wrote what became known as the &quot;Polish Major&#x27;s report&quot; about the situation in the camp. On 27 April 1944, Rudolf Vrba (no. 44070) and Alfréd Wetzler (no. 29162) escaped to Slovakia, carrying detailed information to the Slovak Jewish Council about the gas chambers. The distribution of the Vrba-Wetzler report, and publication of parts of it in June 1944, helped to halt the deportation of Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz. On 27 May 1944, Arnost Rosin (no. 29858) and Czesław Mordowicz (no. 84216) also escaped to Slovakia; the Rosin-Mordowicz report was added to the Vrba-Wetzler and Tabeau reports to become what is known as the &quot;Auschwitz Protocols&quot;. The reports were first published in their entirety in November 1944 by the United States War Refugee Board as &quot;The Extermination Camps of Auschwitz (Oświęcim) and Birkenau in Upper Silesia&quot;.

===Bombing proposal===
In January 1941, the Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Army and prime minister-in-exile, Władysław Sikorski, arranged for a report to be forwarded to Air Marshal Richard Pierse, head of RAF Bomber Command. Written by Auschwitz prisoners in or around December 1940, the report described the camp&#x27;s atrocious living conditions and asked the Polish government-in-exile to bomb it:
Pierse replied that it was not technically feasible to bomb the camp without harming the prisoners. In May 1944 Slovak rabbi Michael Dov Weissmandl suggested that the Allies bomb the rails leading to the camp. Historian David Wyman published an essay in &quot;Commentary&quot; in 1978 entitled &quot;Why Auschwitz Was Never Bombed&quot;, arguing that the United States Army Air Forces could and should have attacked Auschwitz. In his book &quot;The Abandonment of the Jews: America and the Holocaust 1941–1945&quot; (1984), Wyman argued that, since the IG Farben plant at Auschwitz III had been bombed three times between August and December 1944 by the US Fifteenth Air Force in Italy, it would have been feasible for the other camps or railway lines to be bombed too. Bernard Wasserstein&#x27;s &quot;Britain and the Jews of Europe&quot; (1979) and Martin Gilbert&#x27;s &quot;Auschwitz and the Allies&quot; (1981) raised similar questions about British inaction. Since the 1990s, other historians have argued that Allied bombing accuracy was not sufficient for Wyman&#x27;s proposed attack, and that counterfactual history is an inherently problematic endeavor.

===&quot;Sonderkommando&quot; revolt===

The &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; who worked in the crematoria were witnesses to the mass murder and were therefore regularly murdered themselves. On 7 October 1944, following an announcement that 300 of them were to be sent to a nearby town to clear away rubble—&quot;transfers&quot; were a common ruse for the murder of prisoners—the group, mostly Jews from Greece and Hungary, staged an uprising. They attacked the SS with stones and hammers, killing three of them, and set crematorium IV on fire with rags soaked in oil that they had hidden. Hearing the commotion, the &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; at crematorium II believed that a camp uprising had begun and threw their &quot;Oberkapo&quot; into a furnace. After escaping through a fence using wirecutters, they managed to reach Rajsko, where they hid in the granary of an Auschwitz satellite camp, but the SS pursued and killed them by setting the granary on fire.

By the time the rebellion at crematorium IV had been suppressed, 212 members of the &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; were still alive and 451 had been killed. The dead included Zalmen Gradowski, who kept notes of his time in Auschwitz and buried them near crematorium III; after the war, another &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; member showed the prosecutors where to dig. The notes were published in several formats, including in 2017 as &quot;From the Heart of Hell&quot;.

===Evacuation and death marches===
The last mass transports to arrive in Auschwitz were 60,000–70,000 Jews from the Łódź Ghetto, some 2,000 from Theresienstadt, and 8,000 from Slovakia. The last selection took place on 30 October 1944. On 1 or 2 November 1944, Heinrich Himmler ordered the SS to halt the mass murder by gas. On 25 November, he ordered Auschwitz&#x27;s gas chambers and crematoria be destroyed. The &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; and other prisoners began the job of dismantling the buildings and cleaning up the site. On 18 January 1945, Engelbert Marketsch, a German criminal transferred from Mauthausen, became the last prisoner to be assigned a serial number in Auschwitz, number 202499.

According to Polish historian Andrzej Strzelecki, the evacuation of the camp was one of its &quot;most tragic chapters&quot;. Himmler ordered the evacuation of all camps in January 1945, telling camp commanders: &quot;The Führer holds you personally responsible for ... making sure that not a single prisoner from the concentration camps falls alive into the hands of the enemy.&quot; The plundered goods from the &quot;Kanada&quot; barracks, together with building supplies, were transported to the German interior. Between 1 December 1944 and 15 January 1945, over one million items of clothing were packed to be shipped out of Auschwitz; 95,000 such parcels were sent to concentration camps in Germany.

Beginning on 17 January, some 58,000 Auschwitz detainees (about two-thirds Jews)—over 20,000 from Auschwitz I and II and over 30,000 from the subcamps—were evacuated under guard, at first heading west on foot, then by open-topped freight trains, to concentration camps in Germany and Austria: Bergen-Belsen, Buchenwald, Dachau, Flossenburg, Gross-Rosen, Mauthausen, Dora-Mittelbau, Ravensbruck, and Sachsenhausen. Fewer than 9,000 remained in the camps, deemed too sick to move. During the marches, the SS shot or otherwise dispatched anyone unable to continue; &quot;execution details&quot; followed the marchers, killing prisoners who lagged behind. Peter Longerich estimated that a quarter of the detainees were thus killed. By December 1944 some 15,000 Jewish prisoners had made it from Auschwitz to Bergen-Belsen, where they were liberated by the British on 15 April 1945.

On 20 January, crematoria II and III were blown up, and on 23 January the &quot;Kanada&quot; warehouses were set on fire; they apparently burned for five days. Crematorium IV had been partly demolished after the &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; revolt in October, and the rest of it was destroyed later. On 26 January, one day ahead of the Red Army&#x27;s arrival, crematorium V was blown up.

===Liberation===
The first in the camp complex to be liberated was Auschwitz III, the IG Farben camp at Monowitz; a soldier from the 100th Infantry Division of the Red Army entered the camp around 9 am on Saturday, 27 January 1945. The 60th Army of the 1st Ukrainian Front (also part of the Red Army) arrived in Auschwitz I and II around 3 pm. They found 7,000 prisoners alive in the three main camps, 500 in the other subcamps, and over 600 corpses. Items found included 837,000 women&#x27;s garments, 370,000 men&#x27;s suits, 44,000 pairs of shoes, and 7,000 kg of human hair, estimated by the Soviet war crimes commission to have come from 140,000 people. Some of the hair was examined by the Forensic Science Institute in Kraków, where it was found to contain traces of hydrogen cyanide, the main ingredient of Zyklon B. Primo Levi described seeing the first four soldiers on horseback approach Auschwitz III, where he had been in the sick bay. They threw &quot;strangely embarrassed glances at the sprawling bodies, at the battered huts and at us few still alive ...&quot;:
Georgii Elisavetskii, a Soviet soldier who entered one of the barracks, said in 1980 that he could hear other soldiers telling the inmates: &quot;You are free, comrades!&quot; But they did not respond, so he tried in Russian, Polish, German, Ukrainian. Then he used some Yiddish: &quot;They think that I am provoking them. They begin to hide. And only when I said to them: &#x27;Do not be afraid, I am a colonel of Soviet Army and a Jew. We have come to liberate you&#x27; ... Finally, as if the barrier collapsed ... they rushed toward us shouting, fell on their knees, kissed the flaps of our overcoats, and threw their arms around our legs.&quot;

The Soviet military medical service and Polish Red Cross (PCK) set up field hospitals that looked after 4,500 prisoners suffering from the effects of starvation (mostly diarrhea) and tuberculosis. Local volunteers helped until the Red Cross team arrived from Kraków in early February. In Auschwitz II, the layers of excrement on the barracks floors had to be scraped off with shovels. Water was obtained from snow and from fire-fighting wells. Before more help arrived, 2,200 patients there were looked after by a few doctors and 12 PCK nurses. All the patients were later moved to the brick buildings in Auschwitz I, where several blocks became a hospital, with medical personnel working 18-hour shifts.

The liberation of Auschwitz received little press attention at the time; the Red Army was focusing on its advance toward Germany and liberating the camp had not been one of its key aims. Boris Polevoi reported on the liberation in &quot;Pravda&quot; on 2 February 1945 but made no mention of Jews; inmates were described collectively as &quot;victims of Fascism&quot;. It was when the Western Allies arrived in Buchenwald, Bergen-Belsen, and Dachau in April 1945 that the liberation of the camps received extensive coverage.

==After the war==
===Trials of war criminals===
Only 789 Auschwitz staff, up to 15 percent, ever stood trial; most of the cases were pursued in Poland and the Federal Republic of Germany. According to Aleksander Lasik, female SS officers were treated more harshly than male; of the 17 women sentenced, four received the death penalty and the others longer prison terms than the men. He writes that this may have been because there were only 200 women overseers, and therefore they were more visible and memorable to the inmates.

Camp commandant Rudolf Höss was arrested by the British on 11 March 1946 near Flensburg, northern Germany, where he had been working as a farmer under the pseudonym Franz Lang. He was imprisoned in Heide, then transferred to Minden for interrogation, part of the British occupation zone. From there he was taken to Nuremberg to testify for the defense in the trial of &quot;SS-Obergruppenführer&quot; Ernst Kaltenbrunner. Höss was straightforward about his own role in the mass murder and said he had followed the orders of Heinrich Himmler. Extradited to Poland on 25 May 1946, he wrote his memoirs in custody, first published in Polish in 1951 then in German in 1958 as &quot;Kommandant in Auschwitz&quot;. His trial before the Supreme National Tribunal in Warsaw opened on 11 March 1947; he was sentenced to death on 2 April and hanged in Auschwitz I on 16 April, near crematorium I.

On 25 November 1947, the Auschwitz trial began in Kraków, when Poland&#x27;s Supreme National Tribunal brought to court 40 former Auschwitz staff, including commandant Arthur Liebehenschel, women&#x27;s camp leader Maria Mandel, and camp leader Hans Aumeier. The trials ended on 22 December 1947, with 23 death sentences, seven life sentences, and nine prison sentences ranging from three to 15 years. Hans Münch, an SS doctor who had several former prisoners testify on his behalf, was the only person to be acquitted.

Other former staff were hanged for war crimes in the Dachau Trials and the Belsen Trial, including camp leaders Josef Kramer, Franz Hössler, and Vinzenz Schöttl; doctor Friedrich Entress; and guards Irma Grese and Elisabeth Volkenrath. Bruno Tesch and Karl Weinbacher, the owner and chief executive officer of the firm Tesch &amp; Stabenow, one of the suppliers of Zyklon B, were arrested by the British after the war and executed for knowingly supplying the chemical for use on humans. The 180-day Frankfurt Auschwitz trials, held in West Germany from 20 December 1963 to 20 August 1965, tried 22 defendants, including two dentists, a doctor, two camp adjudants and the camp&#x27;s pharmacist. The 700-page indictment, presenting the testimony of 254 witnesses, was accompanied by a 300-page report about the camp, &quot;Nationalsozialistische Konzentrationslager&quot;, written by historians from the &quot;Institut für Zeitgeschichte&quot; in Germany, including Martin Broszat and Helmut Krausnick. The report became the basis of their book, &quot;Anatomy of the SS State&quot; (1968), the first comprehensive study of the camp and the SS. The court convicted 19 of the defendants, giving six of them life sentences and the others between three and ten years. East Germany also held trials against several former staff members of Auschwitz. One of the defendants they tried was Horst Fischer. Fischer, one of the highest-ranking SS physicians in the camp, had personally selected at least 75,000 men, women, and children to be gassed. He was arrested in 1965. The following year, he was convicted of crimes against humanity, sentenced to death, and executed by guillotine. Fischer was the highest-ranking SS physician from Auschwitz to ever be tried by a German court.

===Legacy===

In the decades since its liberation, Auschwitz has become a primary symbol of the Holocaust. Seweryna Szmaglewska&#x27;s 1945 autobiography &quot;Dymy nad Birkenau&quot; (&quot;Smoke over Birkenau&quot;) has been credited with spreading knowledge about the camp to the general public. Historian Timothy D. Snyder attributes this to the camp&#x27;s high death toll and &quot;unusual combination of an industrial camp complex and a killing facility&quot;, which left behind far more witnesses than single-purpose killing facilities such as Chełmno or Treblinka. In 2005 the United Nations General Assembly designated 27 January, the date of the camp&#x27;s liberation, as International Holocaust Remembrance Day. Helmut Schmidt visited the site in November 1977, the first West German chancellor to do so, followed by his successor, Helmut Kohl, in November 1989. In a statement on the 50th anniversary of the liberation, Kohl said that &quot;[t]he darkest and most awful chapter in German history was written at Auschwitz.&quot; In January 2020, world leaders gathered at Yad Vashem in Jerusalem to commemorate the 75th anniversary. It was the city&#x27;s largest-ever political gathering, with over 45 heads of state and world leaders, including royalty. At Auschwitz itself, Reuven Rivlin and Andrzej Duda, the presidents of Israel and Poland, laid wreaths.

Notable memoirists of the camp include Primo Levi, Elie Wiesel, and Tadeusz Borowski. Levi&#x27;s &quot;If This is a Man&quot;, first published in Italy in 1947 as &quot;Se questo è un uomo&quot;, became a classic of Holocaust literature, an &quot;imperishable masterpiece&quot;. Wiesel wrote about his imprisonment at Auschwitz in &quot;Night&quot; (1960) and other works, and became a prominent spokesman against ethnic violence; in 1986, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Camp survivor Simone Veil was elected President of the European Parliament, serving from 1979 to 1982. Two Auschwitz victims—Maximilian Kolbe, a priest who volunteered to die by starvation in place of a stranger, and Edith Stein, a Jewish convert to Catholicism—were named saints of the Catholic Church.

In 2017, a Körber Foundation survey found that 40 percent of 14-year-olds in Germany did not know what Auschwitz was. The following year a survey organized by the Claims Conference, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and others found that 41 percent of 1,350 American adults surveyed, and 66 percent of millennials, did not know what Auschwitz was, while 22 percent said they had never heard of the Holocaust. A CNN-ComRes poll in 2018 found a similar situation in Europe.

===Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum===

On 2 July 1947, the Polish government passed a law establishing a state memorial to remember &quot;the martyrdom of the Polish nation and other nations in Oswiecim&quot;. The museum established its exhibits at Auschwitz I; after the war, the barracks in Auschwitz II-Birkenau had been mostly dismantled and moved to Warsaw to be used on building sites. Dwork and van Pelt write that, in addition, Auschwitz I played a more central role in the persecution of the Polish people, in opposition to the importance of Auschwitz II to the Jews, including Polish Jews. An exhibition opened in Auschwitz I in 1955, displaying prisoner mug shots; hair, suitcases, and shoes taken from murdered prisoners; canisters of Zyklon B pellets; and other objects related to the killings. UNESCO added the camp to its list of World Heritage Sites in 1979. All the museum&#x27;s directors were, until 1990, former Auschwitz prisoners. Visitors to the site have increased from 492,500 in 2001, to over one million in 2009, to two million in 2016.

There have been protracted disputes over the perceived Christianization of the site. Pope John Paul II celebrated mass over the train tracks leading to Auschwitz II-Birkenau on 7 June 1979 and called the camp &quot;the Golgotha of our age&quot;, referring to the crucifixion of Jesus. More controversy followed when Carmelite nuns founded a convent in 1984 in a former theater outside the camp&#x27;s perimeter, near block 11 of Auschwitz I, after which a local priest and some survivors erected a large cross—one that had been used during the pope&#x27;s mass—behind block 11 to commemorate 152 Polish inmates shot by the Germans in 1941. After a long dispute, Pope John Paul II intervened and the nuns moved the convent elsewhere in 1993. The cross remained, triggering the &quot;War of the Crosses&quot;, as more crosses were erected to commemorate Christian victims, despite international objections. The Polish government and Catholic Church eventually agreed to remove all but the original.

On 4 September 2003, despite a protest from the museum, three Israeli Air Force F-15 Eagles performed a fly-over of Auschwitz II-Birkenau during a ceremony at the camp below. All three pilots were descendants of Holocaust survivors, including the man who led the flight, Major-General Amir Eshel. On 27 January 2015, some 300 Auschwitz survivors gathered with world leaders under a giant tent at the entrance to Auschwitz II to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the camp&#x27;s liberation.

Museum curators consider visitors who pick up items from the ground to be thieves, and local police will charge them as such; the maximum penalty is a 10-year prison sentence. In 2017 two British youths from the Perse School were fined in Poland after picking up buttons and shards of decorative glass in 2015 from the &quot;Kanada&quot; area of Auschwitz II, where camp victims&#x27; personal effects were stored. The sign over the main camp&#x27;s gate was stolen in December 2009 by a Swedish former neo-Nazi and two Polish men. The sign was later recovered.

In 2018 the Polish government passed an amendment to its Act on the Institute of National Remembrance, making it a criminal offence to violate the &quot;good name&quot; of Poland by accusing it of crimes committed by Germany in the Holocaust, which would include referring to Auschwitz and other camps as &quot;Polish death camps&quot;. Staff at the museum were accused by nationalist media in Poland of focusing too much on the fate of the Jews in Auschwitz at the expense of ethnic Poles. The brother of the museum&#x27;s director, Piotr Cywiński, wrote that Cywiński had experienced &quot;50 days of incessant hatred&quot;. After discussions with Israel&#x27;s prime minister, amid international concern that the new law would stifle research, the Polish government adjusted the amendment so that anyone accusing Poland of complicity would be guilty only of a civil offence.

<text>Archery is the sport, practice, or skill of using a bow to shoot arrows. The word comes from the Latin &quot;arcus&quot;, meaning bow. Historically, archery has been used for hunting and combat. In modern times, it is mainly a competitive sport and recreational activity. A person who practices archery is typically called an archer, bowman, or toxophilite.

==History==
===Origins and ancient archery===
The oldest known evidence of the bow and arrow comes from South African sites such as Sibudu Cave, where the remains of bone and stone arrowheads have been found dating approximately 72,000 to 60,000 years ago.
Based on indirect evidence, the bow also seems to have appeared or reappeared later in Eurasia, near the transition from the Upper Paleolithic to the Mesolithic. The earliest definite remains of bow and arrow from Europe are possible fragments from Germany found at Mannheim-Vogelstang dated 17,500 to 18,000 years ago, and at Stellmoor dated 11,000 years ago. Azilian points found in Grotte du Bichon, Switzerland, alongside the remains of both a bear and a hunter, with flint fragments found in the bear&#x27;s third vertebra, suggest the use of arrows at 13,500 years ago. 

Other signs of its use in Europe come from the in the north of Hamburg, Germany and dates from the late Paleolithic, about 10,000–9000 BC. The arrows were made of pine and consisted of a main shaft and a fore shaft with a flint point. There are no definite earlier bows; previous pointed shafts are known, but may have been launched by spear-throwers rather than bows. The oldest bows known so far comes from the Holmegård swamp in Denmark. At the site of Nataruk in Turkana County, Kenya, obsidian bladelets found embedded in a skull and within the thoracic cavity of another skeleton, suggest the use of stone-tipped arrows as weapons about 10,000 years ago. Bows eventually replaced the spear-thrower as the predominant means for launching shafted projectiles, on every continent except Australasia, though spear-throwers persisted alongside the bow in parts of the Americas, including Mexico and among the Inuit.

Bows and arrows have been present in Egyptian and neighbouring Nubian culture since its respective predynastic and Pre-Kerma origins. In the Levant, artifacts that could be arrow-shaft straighteners are known from the Natufian culture, (c. 10,800–8,300 BC) onwards. The Khiamian and PPN A shouldered Khiam-points may well be arrowheads.

Classical civilizations, notably the Assyrians, Greeks, Armenians, Persians, Parthians, Romans, Indians, Koreans, Chinese, and Japanese fielded large numbers of archers in their armies. Akkadians were the first to use composite bows in war according to the victory stele of Naram-Sin of Akkad. Egyptians referred to Nubia as &quot;Ta-Seti,&quot; or &quot;The Land of the Bow,&quot; since the Nubians were known to be expert archers, and by the 16th Century BC Egyptians were using the composite bow in warfare. The Bronze Age Aegean Cultures were able to deploy a number of state-owned specialized bow makers for warfare and hunting purposes already from the 15th century BC. The Welsh longbow proved its worth for the first time in Continental warfare at the Battle of Crécy. In the Americas archery was widespread at European contact.

Archery was highly developed in Asia. The Sanskrit term for archery, dhanurvidya, came to refer to martial arts in general. In East Asia, Goguryeo, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea was well known for its regiments of exceptionally skilled archers.

===Medieval archery===
The medieval shortbow was technically identical with the classical era bows, having a range of approximately . It was the primary ranged weapon of the battlefield through the early medieval period. Around the tenth century the crossbow was introduced in Europe. Crossbows generally had a longer range, greater accuracy and more penetration than the shortbow, but suffered from a much slower rate of fire. Crossbows were used in the early Crusades, with models having a range of and being able to penetrate armour or kill a horse.

During the late medieval period the English army famously relied on massed archers armed with the longbow. The French army relied more on the crossbow. Like their predecessors archers were more likely to be peasants or yeomen than men-at-arms. The longbow had a range of up to . However its lack of accuracy at long ranges made it a mass weapon rather than an individual one. Significant victories attributable to the longbow, such as the Battle of Crecy and Battle of Agincourt resulted in the English longbow becoming part of military lore.

===Mounted archery===

Tribesmen of Central Asia (after the domestication of the horse) and American Plains Indians (after gaining access to horses by Europeans) became extremely adept at archery on horseback. Lightly armoured, but highly mobile archers were excellently suited to warfare in the Central Asian steppes, and they formed a large part of armies that repeatedly conquered large areas of Eurasia. Shorter bows are more suited to use on horseback, and the composite bow enabled mounted archers to use powerful weapons. Seljuk Turks used mounted archers against the European First Crusade, especially at the Battle of Dorylaeum (1097). Their tactic was to shoot at the enemy infantry, and use their superior mobility to prevent the enemy from closing with them. Empires throughout the Eurasian landmass often strongly associated their respective &quot;barbarian&quot; counterparts with the usage of the bow and arrow, to the point where powerful states like the Han dynasty referred to their neighbours, the Xiong-nu, as &quot;Those Who Draw the Bow&quot;. For example, Xiong-nu mounted bowmen made them more than a match for the Han military, and their threat was at least partially responsible for Chinese expansion into the Ordos region, to create a stronger, more powerful buffer zone against them. It is possible that &quot;barbarian&quot; peoples were responsible for introducing archery or certain types of bows to their &quot;civilized&quot; counterpartsthe Xiong-nu and the Han being one example. Similarly, short bows seem to have been introduced to Japan by northeast Asian groups.

===Decline of archery===
The development of firearms rendered the bow and arrow obsolete in warfare, although efforts were sometimes made to preserve archery practice. In England and Wales, for example, the government tried to enforce practice with the longbow until the end of the 16th century. This was because it was recognized that the bow had been instrumental to military success during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. Despite the high social status, ongoing utility, and widespread pleasure of archery in Armenia, China, Egypt, England and Wales, the Americas, India, Japan, Korea, Turkey and elsewhere, almost every culture that gained access to even early firearms used them widely, to the neglect of archery. Early firearms were inferior in rate-of-fire, and were very sensitive to wet weather. However, they had longer effective range and were tactically superior in the common situation of soldiers shooting at each other from behind obstructions. They also required significantly less training to use properly, in particular penetrating steel armor without any need to develop special musculature. Armies equipped with guns could thus provide superior firepower, and highly trained archers became obsolete on the battlefield. However, the bow and arrow is still an effective weapon, and archers have seen military action in the 21st century. Traditional archery remains in use for sport, and for hunting in many areas.

===18th century revival as a sport===
Early recreational archery societies included the Finsbury Archers and the Ancient Society of Kilwinning Archers. The latter&#x27;s annual Papingo event was first recorded in 1483. (In this event, archers shoot vertically from the base of an abbey tower to dislodge a wood pigeon placed approximately above.) The Royal Company of Archers was formed in 1676 and is one of the oldest sporting bodies in the world. Archery remained a small and scattered pastime, however, until the late 18th century when it experienced a fashionable revival among the aristocracy. Sir Ashton Lever, an antiquarian and collector, formed the Toxophilite Society in London in 1781, with the patronage of George, the Prince of Wales.

Archery societies were set up across the country, each with its own strict entry criteria and outlandish costumes. Recreational archery soon became extravagant social and ceremonial events for the nobility, complete with flags, music and 21-gun salutes for the competitors. The clubs were &quot;the drawing rooms of the great country houses placed outside&quot; and thus came to play an important role in the social networks of the local upper class. As well as its emphasis on display and status, the sport was notable for its popularity with females. Young women could not only compete in the contests but retain and show off their sexuality while doing so. Thus, archery came to act as a forum for introductions, flirtation and romance. It was often consciously styled in the manner of a Medieval tournament with titles and laurel wreaths being presented as a reward to the victor. General meetings were held from 1789, in which local lodges convened together to standardise the rules and ceremonies. Archery was also co-opted as a distinctively British tradition, dating back to the lore of Robin Hood and it served as a patriotic form of entertainment at a time of political tension in Europe. The societies were also elitist, and the new middle class bourgeoisie were excluded from the clubs due to their lack of social status.

After the Napoleonic Wars, the sport became increasingly popular among all classes, and it was framed as a nostalgic reimagining of the preindustrial rural Britain. Particularly influential was Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s 1819 novel, &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; that depicted the heroic character Lockseley winning an archery tournament.

===A modern sport===
The 1840s saw the second attempts at turning the recreation into a modern sport. The first Grand National Archery Society meeting was held in York in 1844 and over the next decade the extravagant and festive practices of the past were gradually whittled away and the rules were standardized as the &#x27;York Round&#x27; - a series of shoots at , , and . Horace A. Ford helped to improve archery standards and pioneered new archery techniques. He won the Grand National 11 times in a row and published a highly influential guide to the sport in 1856.
Towards the end of the 19th century, the sport experienced declining participation as alternative sports such as croquet and tennis became more popular among the middle class. By 1889, just 50 archery clubs were left in Britain, but it was still included as a sport at the 1900 Paris Olympics.

The National Archery Association of the United States was organized in 1879, in part by Maurice Thompson (the author of the seminal text “The Witchery of Archery”) and his brother Will Thompson. Maurice was president in its inaugural year and Will was president in 1882, 1903, and 1904. The 1910 President was Frank E Canfield. Today it is known as USA Archery and is recognized by United States Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee.

In the United States, primitive archery was revived in the early 20th century. The last of the Yahi Indian tribe, a native known as Ishi, came out of hiding in California in 1911. His doctor, Saxton Pope, learned many of Ishi&#x27;s traditional archery skills, and popularized them. 
From the 1920s, professional engineers took an interest in archery, previously the exclusive field of traditional craft experts. They led the commercial development of new forms of bow including the modern recurve and compound bow. These modern forms are now dominant in modern Western archery; traditional bows are in a minority. Archery returned to the Olympics in 1972. In the 1980s, the skills of traditional archery were revived by American enthusiasts, and combined with the new scientific understanding. Much of this expertise is available in the &quot;Traditional Bowyer&#x27;s Bibles&quot; (see Further reading). Modern game archery owes much of its success to Fred Bear, an American bow hunter and bow manufacturer.

In 2021, five people were killed and three injured by an archer in Norway in the Kongsberg attack.

===Mythology===

Deities and heroes in several mythologies are described as archers, including the Greek Artemis and Apollo, the Roman Diana and Cupid, the Germanic Agilaz, continuing in legends like those of Wilhelm Tell, Palnetoke, or Robin Hood. Armenian Hayk and Babylonian Marduk, Indian Karna (also known as Radheya/son of Radha), Abhimanyu, Eklavya, Arjuna, Bhishma, Drona, Rama, and Shiva were known for their shooting skills. The famous archery competition of hitting the eye of a rotating fish while watching its reflection in the water bowl was one of the many archery skills depicted in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;.
Persian Arash was a famous archer. Earlier Greek representations of Heracles normally depict him as an archer. Archery, and the bow, play an important part in the epic poem the &quot;Odyssey,&quot; when Odysseus returns home in disguise and then bests the suitors in an archery competition after hinting at his identity by stringing and drawing his great bow that only he can draw, a similar motif is present in the Turkic Iranian heroic archeheroic poem &quot;Alpamysh&quot;.

The () were worshipped on the Greek island of Delos as attendants of Artemis, presiding over aspects of archery; (), represented distancing, (), trajectory, and (), aim.

Yi the archer and his apprentice Feng Meng appear in several early Chinese myths, and the historical character of Zhou Tong features in many fictional forms. Jumong, the first Taewang of the Goguryeo kingdom of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, is claimed by legend to have been a near-godlike archer. Archery features in the story of Oguz Khagan. Similarly, archery and the bow feature heavily into historical Korean identity.

In West African Yoruba belief, Osoosi is one of several deities of the hunt who are identified with bow and arrow iconography and other insignia associated with archery.

==Equipment==
===Types of bows===

While there is great variety in the construction details of bows (both historical and modern), all bows consist of a string attached to elastic limbs that store mechanical energy imparted by the user drawing the string. Bows may be broadly split into two categories: those drawn by pulling the string directly and those that use a mechanism to pull the string.

Directly drawn bows may be further divided based upon differences in the method of limb construction, notable examples being self bows, laminated bows and composite bows. Bows can also be classified by the bow shape of the limbs when unstrung; in contrast to traditional European straight bows, a recurve bow and some types of longbow have tips that curve away from the archer when the bow is unstrung. The cross-section of the limb also varies; the classic longbow is a tall bow with narrow limbs that are D-shaped in cross section, and the flatbow has flat wide limbs that are approximately rectangular in cross-section. Cable-backed bows use cords as the back of the bow; the draw weight of the bow can be adjusted by changing the tension of the cable. They were widespread among Inuit who lacked easy access to good bow wood. One variety of cable-backed bow is the Penobscot bow or Wabenaki bow, invented by Frank Loring (Chief Big Thunder) about 1900. It consists of a small bow attached by cables on the back of a larger main bow.

In different cultures, the arrows are released from either the left or right side of the bow, and this affects the hand grip and position of the bow. In Arab archery, Turkish archery, and Japanese archery. The arrows are released from the right hand side of the bow, and this affects construction of the bow. In western archery, the arrow is usually released from the left hand side of the bow for a right-handed archer.

Compound bows are designed to reduce the force required to hold the string at full draw, hence allowing the archer more time to aim with less muscular stress. Most compound designs use cams or elliptical wheels on the ends of the limbs to achieve this. A typical let-off is anywhere from 65% to 80%. For example, a bow with 80% let-off only requires to hold at full draw. Up to 99% let-off is possible. The compound bow was invented by Holless Wilbur Allen in the 1960s (a US patent was filed in 1966 and granted in 1969) and it has become the most widely used type of bow for all forms of archery in North America.

Mechanically drawn bows typically have a stock or other mounting, such as the crossbow. Crossbows typically have shorter draw lengths compared to compound bows. Because of this, heavier draw weights are required to achieve the same energy transfer to the arrow. These mechanically drawn bows also have devices to hold the tension when the bow is fully drawn. They are not limited by the strength of a single archer and larger varieties have been used as siege engines.

===Types of arrows and fletchings===
The most common form of arrow consists of a shaft, with an arrowhead at the front end, and fletchings and a nock at the other end. Arrows across time and history have normally been carried in a container known as a quiver, which can take many different forms. Shafts of arrows are typically composed of solid wood, bamboo, fiberglass, aluminium alloy, carbon fiber, or composite materials. Wooden arrows are prone to warping. Fiberglass arrows are brittle, but can be produced to uniform specifications easily. Aluminium shafts were a very popular high-performance choice in the latter half of the 20th century, due to their straightness, lighter weight, and subsequently higher speed and flatter trajectories. Carbon fiber arrows became popular in the 1990s because they are very light, flying even faster and flatter than aluminium arrows. Today, the most popular arrows at tournaments and Olympic events are made of composite materials.

The arrowhead is the primary functional component of the arrow. Some arrows may simply use a sharpened tip of the solid shaft, but separate arrowheads are far more common, usually made from metal, stone, or other hard materials. The most commonly used forms are target points, field points, and broadheads, although there are also other types, such as bodkin, judo, and blunt heads.

Fletching is traditionally made from bird feathers, but solid plastic vanes and thin sheet-like spin vanes are used. They are attached near the nock (rear) end of the arrow with thin double sided tape, glue, or, traditionally, sinew. The most common configuration in all cultures is three fletches, though as many as six have been used. Two makes the arrow unstable in flight. When the arrow is &quot;three-fletched&quot;, the fletches are equally spaced around the shaft, with one placed such that it is perpendicular to the bow when nocked on the string, though variations are seen with modern equipment, especially when using the modern spin vanes. This fletch is called the &quot;index fletch&quot; or &quot;cock feather&quot; (also known as &quot;the odd vane out&quot; or &quot;the nocking vane&quot;), and the others are sometimes called the &quot;hen feathers&quot;. Commonly, the cock feather is of a different color. However, if archers are using fletching made of feather or similar material, they may use same color vanes, as different dyes can give varying stiffness to vanes, resulting in less precision. When an arrow is &quot;four-fletched&quot;, two opposing fletches are often cock feathers, and occasionally the fletches are not evenly spaced.

The fletching may be either &quot;parabolic&quot; cut (short feathers in a smooth parabolic curve) or &quot;shield&quot; cut (generally shaped like half of a narrow shield), and is often attached at an angle, known as &quot;helical&quot; fletching, to introduce a stabilizing spin to the arrow while in flight. Whether helical or straight fletched, when natural fletching (bird feathers) is used it is critical that all feathers come from the same side of the bird. Oversized fletchings can be used to accentuate drag and thus limit the range of the arrow significantly; these arrows are called &quot;flu-flus&quot;. Misplacement of fletchings can change the arrow&#x27;s flight path dramatically.

===Bowstring===
Dacron and other modern materials offer high strength for their weight and are used on most modern bows. Linen and other traditional materials are still used on traditional bows. Several modern methods of making a bowstring exist, such as the &#x27;endless loop&#x27; and &#x27;Flemish twist&#x27;. Almost any fiber can be made into a bowstring. The author of &quot;Arab Archery&quot; suggests the hide of a young, emaciated camel. Njál&#x27;s saga describes the refusal of a wife, Hallgerður, to cut her hair to make an emergency bowstring for her husband, Gunnar Hámundarson, who is then killed.

===Protective equipment===

Most modern archers wear a bracer (also known as an arm-guard) to protect the inside of the bow arm from being hit by the string and prevent clothing from catching the bowstring. The bracer does not brace the arm; the word comes from the armoury term &quot;brassard&quot;, meaning an armoured sleeve or badge. The Navajo people have developed highly ornamented bracers as non-functional items of adornment. Some archers (nearly all female archers) wear protection on their chests, called chestguards or plastrons. The myth of the Amazons was that they had one breast removed to solve this problem. Roger Ascham mentions one archer, presumably with an unusual shooting style, who wore a leather guard for his face.

The drawing digits are normally protected by a leather tab, glove, or thumb ring. A simple tab of leather is commonly used, as is a skeleton glove. Medieval Europeans probably used a complete leather glove.

Eurasiatic archers who used the thumb or Mongolian draw protected their thumbs, usually with leather according to the author of &quot;Arab Archery&quot;, but also with special rings of various hard materials. Many surviving Turkish and Chinese examples are works of considerable art. Some are so highly ornamented that the users could not have used them to loose an arrow. Possibly these were items of personal adornment, and hence value, remaining extant whilst leather had virtually no intrinsic value and would also deteriorate with time. In traditional Japanese archery a special glove is used that has a ridge to assist in drawing the string.

===Release aids===
A release aid is a mechanical device designed to give a crisp and precise loose of arrows from a compound bow. In the most commonly used, the string is released by a finger-operated trigger mechanism, held in the archer&#x27;s hand or attached to their wrist. In another type, known as a back-tension release, the string is automatically released when drawn to a pre-determined tension.

===Stabilizers===

Stabilizers are mounted at various points on the bow. Common with competitive archery equipment are special brackets that allow multiple stabilizers to be mounted at various angles to fine tune the bow&#x27;s balance.

Stabilizers aid in aiming by improving the balance of the bow. Sights, quivers, rests, and design of the riser (the central, non-bending part of the bow) make one side of the bow heavier. One purpose of stabilizers are to offset these forces. A reflex riser design will cause the top limb to lean towards the shooter. In this case a heavier front stabilizer is desired to offset this action. A deflex riser design has the opposite effect and a lighter front stabilizer may be used.

Stabilizers can reduce noise and vibration. These energies are absorbed by viscoelastic polymers, gels, powders, and other materials used to build stabilizers.

Stabilizers improve the forgiveness and accuracy by increasing the moment of inertia of the bow to resist movement during the shooting process. Lightweight carbon stabilizers with weighted ends are desirable because they improve the moment of inertia while minimizing the weight added.

==Shooting technique and form==

The standard convention on teaching archery is to hold the bow depending upon eye dominance. (One exception is in modern kyūdō where all archers are trained to hold the bow in the left hand.) Therefore, if one is right-eye dominant, they would hold the bow in the left hand and draw the string with the right hand. However, not everyone agrees with this line of thought. A smoother, and more fluid release of the string will produce the most consistently repeatable shots, and therefore may provide greater accuracy of the arrow flight. Some believe that the hand with the greatest dexterity should therefore be the hand that draws and releases the string. Either eye can be used for aiming, and the less dominant eye can be trained over time to become more effective for use. To assist with this, an eye patch can be temporarily worn over the dominant eye.

The hand that holds the bow is referred to as the &quot;bow hand&quot; and its arm the &quot;bow arm&quot;. The opposite hand is called the &quot;drawing hand&quot; or &quot;string hand&quot;. Terms such as &quot;bow shoulder&quot; or &quot;string elbow&quot; follow the same convention.

If shooting according to eye dominance, right-eye-dominant archers shooting conventionally hold the bow with their left hand. If shooting according to hand dexterity, the archer draws the string with the hand that possesses the greatest dexterity, regardless of eye dominance.

===Modern form===
To shoot an arrow, an archer first assumes the correct stance. The body should be at or nearly perpendicular to the target and the shooting line, with the feet placed shoulder-width apart. As an archer progresses from beginner to a more advanced level other stances such as the &quot;open stance&quot; or the &quot;closed stance&quot; may be used, although many choose to stick with a &quot;neutral stance&quot;. Each archer has a particular preference, but mostly this term indicates that the leg furthest from the shooting line is a half to a whole foot-length from the other foot, on the ground.

To load, the bow is pointed toward the ground, tipped slightly clockwise of vertical (for a right handed shooter) and the shaft of the arrow is placed on the arrow rest or shelf. The back of the arrow is attached to the bowstring with the nock (a small locking groove located at the proximal end of the arrow). This step is called &quot;nocking the arrow&quot;. Typical arrows with three vanes should be oriented such that a single vane, the &quot;cock feather&quot;, is pointing away from the bow, to improve the clearance of the arrow as it passes the arrow rest.

A compound bow is fitted with a special type of arrow rest, known as a launcher, and the arrow is usually loaded with the cock feather/vane pointed either up, or down, depending upon the type of launcher being used.

The bowstring and arrow are held with three fingers, or with a mechanical arrow release. Most commonly, for finger shooters, the index finger is placed above the arrow and the next two fingers below, although several other techniques have their adherents around the world, involving three fingers below the arrow, or an arrow pinching technique. &quot;Instinctive&quot; shooting is a technique eschewing sights and is often preferred by traditional archers (shooters of longbows and recurves). In either the split finger or three finger under case, the string is usually placed in the first or second joint, or else on the pads of the fingers. When using a mechanical release aid, the release is hooked onto the D-loop.

Another type of string hold, used on traditional bows, is the type favoured by the Mongol warriors, known as the &quot;thumb release&quot;, style. This involves using the thumb to draw the string, with the fingers curling around the thumb to add some support. To release the string, the fingers are opened out and the thumb relaxes to allow the string to slide off the thumb. When using this type of release, the arrow should rest on the same side of the bow as the drawing hand i.e. Left hand draw = arrow on left side of bow.

The archer then raises the bow and draws the string, with varying alignments for vertical versus slightly canted bow positions. This is often one fluid motion for shooters of recurves and longbows, which tend to vary from archer to archer. Compound shooters often experience a slight jerk during the drawback, at around the last , where the draw weight is at its maximum—before relaxing into a comfortable stable full draw position. The archer draws the string hand towards the face, where it should rest lightly at a fixed &quot;anchor point&quot;. This point is consistent from shot to shot, and is usually at the corner of the mouth, on the chin, to the cheek, or to the ear, depending on preferred shooting style. The archer holds the bow arm outwards, toward the target. The elbow of this arm should be rotated so that the inner elbow is perpendicular to the ground, though archers with hyper extendable elbows tend to angle the inner elbow toward the ground, as exemplified by the Korean archer Jang Yong-Ho. This keeps the forearm out of the way of the bowstring.

In modern form, the archer stands erect, forming a &quot;T&quot;. The archer&#x27;s lower trapezius muscles are used to pull the arrow to the anchor point. Some modern recurve bows are equipped with a mechanical device, called a clicker, which produces a clicking sound when the archer reaches the correct draw length. , traditional English Longbow shooters step &quot;into the bow&quot;, exerting force with both the bow arm and the string hand arm simultaneously, especially when using bows having draw weights from to over . Heavily stacked traditional bows (recurves, long bows, and the like) are released immediately upon reaching full draw at maximum weight, whereas compound bows reach their maximum weight around the last , dropping holding weight significantly at full draw. Compound bows are often held at full draw for a short time to achieve maximum accuracy.

The arrow is typically released by relaxing the fingers of the drawing hand (see bow draw), or triggering the mechanical release aid. Usually the release aims to keep the drawing arm rigid, the bow hand relaxed, and the arrow is moved back using the back muscles, as opposed to using just arm motions. An archer should also pay attention to the recoil or &quot;follow through&quot; of his or her body, as it may indicate problems with form (technique) that affect accuracy.

==Aiming methods==

There are two main forms of aiming in archery: using a mechanical or fixed sight, or barebow.

Mechanical sights can be affixed to the bow to aid in aiming. They can be as simple as a pin, or may use optics with magnification. Modern compound bows usually also have a peep sight (rear sight) built into the string, which aids in a consistent anchor point, but this is not allowed for other bow types under World Archery. Modern compound bows automatically limit the draw length to give a consistent arrow velocity, while traditional bows allow great variation in draw length. Some bows use mechanical methods to make the draw length consistent. Barebow archers often use a sight picture, which includes the target, the bow, the hand, the arrow shaft and the arrow tip, as seen at the same time by the archer. With a fixed &quot;anchor point&quot; (where the string is brought to, or close to, the face), and a fully extended bow arm, successive shots taken with the sight picture in the same position fall on the same point. This lets the archer adjust aim with successive shots to achieve accuracy.

Modern archery equipment usually includes sights. Instinctive aiming is used by many archers who use traditional bows. The two most common forms of a non-mechanical release are split-finger and three-under. Split-finger aiming requires the archer to place the index finger above the nocked arrow, while the middle and ring fingers are both placed below. Three-under aiming places the index, middle, and ring fingers under the nocked arrow. This technique allows the archer to better look down the arrow since the back of the arrow is closer to the dominant eye, and is commonly called &quot;gun barreling&quot; (referring to common aiming techniques used with firearms).

When using short bows or shooting from horseback, it is difficult to use the sight picture. The archer may look at the target, but without including the weapon in the field of accurate view. Aiming then involves hand-eye coordination—which includes proprioception and motor-muscle memory, similar to that used when throwing a ball. With sufficient practice, such archers can normally achieve good practical accuracy for hunting or for war. Aiming without a sight picture may allow more rapid shooting, not however increasing accuracy.

=== Instinctive shooting ===
Instinctive shooting is a style of shooting that includes the barebow aiming method that relies heavily upon the subconscious mind, proprioception, and motor/muscle memory to make aiming adjustments; the term used to refer to a general category of archers who did not use a mechanical or fixed sight. In other words, it is shooting &quot;by feel.&quot;

=== Gap shooting ===
Gap shooting is an aiming method used by instinctive shooters. It involves consciously focusing on the tip of the arrow while maintaining awareness of the target. The archer must adjust the arrow&#x27;s trajectory by gauging the distance between the arrow tip and the target, ensuring accurate shots.

== Physics ==
When a projectile is thrown by hand, the speed of the projectile is determined by the kinetic energy imparted by the thrower&#x27;s muscles performing work. However, the energy must be imparted over a limited distance (determined by arm length) and therefore (because the projectile is accelerating) over a limited time, so the limiting factor is not work but rather power, which determines how much energy can be added in the limited time available. Power generated by muscles, however, is limited by force–velocity relationship, and even at the optimal contraction speed for power production, total work by the muscle is less than half of what it would be if the muscle contracted over the same distance at slow speeds, resulting in less than 1/4 the projectile launch velocity possible without the limitations of the force–velocity relationship.

When a bow is used, the muscles are able to perform work much more slowly, resulting in greater force and greater work done. This work is stored in the bow as elastic potential energy, and when the bowstring is released, this stored energy is imparted to the arrow much more quickly than can be delivered by the muscles, resulting in much higher velocity and, hence, greater distance. This same process is employed by frogs, which use elastic tendons to increase jumping distance. In archery, some energy dissipates through elastic hysteresis, reducing the overall amount released when the bow is shot. Of the remaining energy, some is dampened both by the limbs of the bow and the bowstring. Depending on the arrow&#x27;s elasticity, some of the energy is also absorbed by compressing the arrow, primarily because the release of the bowstring is rarely in line with the arrow shaft, causing it to flex out to one side. This is because the bowstring accelerates faster than the archer&#x27;s fingers can open, and consequently some sideways motion is imparted to the string, and hence arrow nock, as the power and speed of the bow pulls the string off the opening fingers.

Even with a release aid mechanism some of this effect is usually experienced, since the string always accelerates faster than the retaining part of the mechanism. This makes the arrow oscillate in flight—its center flexing to one side and then the other repeatedly, gradually reducing as the arrow&#x27;s flight proceeds. This is clearly visible in high-speed photography of arrows at discharge. A direct effect of these energy transfers can clearly be seen when dry firing. Dry firing refers to releasing the bowstring without a nocked arrow. Because there is no arrow to receive the stored potential energy, almost all the energy stays in the bow. Some have suggested that dry firing may cause physical damage to the bow, such as cracks and fractures—and because most bows are not specifically made to handle the high amounts of energy dry firing produces, should never be done.
Modern arrows are made to a specified &#x27;spine&#x27;, or stiffness rating, to maintain matched flexing and hence accuracy of aim. This flexing can be a desirable feature, since, when the spine of the shaft is matched to the acceleration of the bow(string), the arrow bends or flexes around the bow and any arrow-rest, and consequently the arrow, and fletchings, have an un-impeded flight. This feature is known as the archer&#x27;s paradox. It maintains accuracy, for if part of the arrow struck a glancing blow on a part of the bow during discharge, some inconsistency would be present, and the excellent accuracy of modern equipment would not be achieved.

The accurate flight of an arrow depends on its fletchings. The arrow&#x27;s manufacturer (a &quot;fletcher&quot;) can arrange fletching to cause the arrow to rotate along its axis. This improves accuracy by evening pressure buildups that would otherwise cause the arrow to &quot;plane&quot; on the air in a random direction after shooting. Even with a carefully made arrow, the slightest imperfection or air movement causes some unbalanced turbulence in air flow. Consequently, rotation creates an equalization of such turbulence, which, overall, maintains the intended direction of flight i.e. accuracy. This rotation is not to be confused with the rapid gyroscopic rotation of a rifle bullet. Fletching that is not arranged to induce rotation still improves accuracy by causing a restoring drag any time the arrow tilts from its intended direction of travel.

The innovative aspect of the invention of the bow and arrow was the amount of power delivered to an extremely small area by the arrow. The huge ratio of length vs. cross sectional area, coupled with velocity, made the arrow more powerful than any other hand held weapon until firearms were invented. Arrows can spread or concentrate force, depending on the application. Practice arrows, for instance, have a blunt tip that spreads the force over a wider area to reduce the risk of injury or limit penetration. Arrows designed to pierce armor in the Middle Ages used a very narrow and sharp tip (&quot;bodkinhead&quot;) to concentrate the force. Arrows used for hunting used a narrow tip (&quot;broadhead&quot;) that widens further, to facilitate both penetration and a large wound.

==Hunting==


Using archery to take game animals is known as &quot;bow hunting&quot;. Bow hunting differs markedly from hunting with firearms, as distance between hunter and prey must be much shorter to ensure a humane kill. The skills and practices of bow hunting therefore emphasize very close approach to the prey, whether by still hunting, stalking, or waiting in a blind or tree stand. In many countries, including much of the United States, bow hunting for large and small game is legal. Bow hunters generally enjoy longer seasons than are allowed with other forms of hunting such as black powder, shotgun, or rifle. Usually, compound bows are used for large game hunting due to the relatively short time it takes to master them as opposed to the longbow or recurve bow. These compound bows may feature fiber optic sights, stabilizers, and other accessories designed to increase accuracy at longer distances. Using a bow and arrow to take fish is known as &quot;bow fishing&quot;.

==Modern competitive archery==

Competitive archery involves shooting arrows at a target for accuracy from a set distance or distances. This is the most popular form of competitive archery worldwide and is called target archery. A form particularly popular in Europe and America is field archery, shot at targets generally set at various distances in a wooded setting. Competitive archery in the United States is governed by USA Archery and National Field Archery Association (NFAA), which also certifies instructors.

Para-archery is an adaptation of archery for athletes with a disability, governed by the World Archery (WA) and is one of the sports in the Summer Paralympic Games. There are also several other lesser-known and historical forms of archery, as well as archery novelty games and flight archery, where the aim is to shoot the greatest distance.

<text>Hugo Alvar Henrik Aalto (; 3 February 1898 – 11 May 1976) was a Finnish architect and designer. His work includes architecture, furniture, textiles and glassware, as well as sculptures and paintings. He never regarded himself as an artist, seeing painting and sculpture as &quot;branches of the tree whose trunk is architecture.&quot; Aalto&#x27;s early career ran in parallel with the rapid economic growth and industrialization of Finland during the first half of the 20th century. Many of his clients were industrialists, among them the Ahlström-Gullichsen family, who became his patrons. The span of his career, from the 1920s to the 1970s, is reflected in the styles of his work, ranging from Nordic Classicism of the early work, to a rational International Style Modernism during the 1930s to a more organic modernist style from the 1940s onwards.

His architectural work, throughout his entire career, is characterized by a concern for design as Gesamtkunstwerk—a &quot;total work of art&quot; in which he, together with his first wife Aino Aalto, would design not only the building but the interior surfaces, furniture, lamps, and glassware as well. His furniture designs are considered Scandinavian Modern, an aesthetic reflected in their elegant simplification and concern for materials, especially wood, but also in Aalto&#x27;s technical innovations, which led him to receiving patents for various manufacturing processes, such as those used to produce bent wood. As a designer he is celebrated as a forerunner of midcentury modernism in design; his invention of bent plywood furniture had a profound impact on the aesthetics of Charles and Ray Eames and George Nelson. The Alvar Aalto Museum, designed by Aalto himself, is located in what is regarded as his home city, Jyväskylä.

The entry for him on the Museum of Modern Art website notes his &quot;remarkable synthesis of romantic and pragmatic ideas,&quot; adding

His work reflects a deep desire to humanize architecture through an unorthodox handling of form and materials that was both rational and intuitive. Influenced by the so-called International Style modernism (or functionalism, as it was called in Finland) and his acquaintance with leading modernists in Europe, including Swedish architect Erik Gunnar Asplund and many of the artists and architects associated with the Bauhaus, Aalto created designs that had a profound impact on the trajectory of modernism before and after World War II.

==Biography==
===Life===


Hugo Alvar Henrik Aalto was born in Kuortane, Finland. His father, Johan Henrik Aalto, was a Finnish-speaking land-surveyor and his mother, Selma Matilda &quot;Selly&quot; (née Hackstedt) was a Swedish-speaking postmistress. When Aalto was 5 years old, the family moved to Alajärvi, and from there to Jyväskylä in Central Finland.

He studied at the Jyväskylä Lyceum school, where he completed his basic education in 1916, and took drawing lessons from local artist Jonas Heiska. In 1916, he then enrolled to study architecture at the Helsinki University of Technology. His studies were interrupted by the Finnish Civil War, in which he fought. He fought on the side of the &quot;White Army&quot; and fought at the Battle of Länkipohja and the Battle of Tampere.

He built his first piece of architecture while a student; a house for his parents at Alajärvi. Later, he continued his education, graduating in 1921. In the summer of 1922 he began military service, finishing at Hamina reserve officer training school, and was promoted to reserve second lieutenant in June 1923.

In 1920, while a student, Aalto made his first trip abroad, travelling via Stockholm to Gothenburg, where he briefly found work with architect Arvid Bjerke. In 1922, he accomplished his first independent piece at the Industrial Exposition in Tampere. In 1923, he returned to Jyväskylä, where he opened an architectural office under the name &#x27;Alvar Aalto, Architect and Monumental Artist&#x27;. At that time he wrote articles for the Jyväskylä newspaper &quot;Sisä-Suomi&quot; under the pseudonym Remus. During this time, he designed a number of small single-family houses in Jyväskylä, and the office&#x27;s workload steadily increased.

On 6 October 1924, Aalto married architect Aino Marsio. Their honeymoon in Italy was Aalto&#x27;s first trip there, though Aino had previously made a study trip there. The latter trip together sealed an intellectual bond with the culture of the Mediterranean region that remained important to Aalto for life.

On their return they continued with several local projects, notably the Jyväskylä Worker&#x27;s Club, which incorporated a number of motifs which they had studied during their trip, most notably the decorations of the Festival hall modelled on the Rucellai Sepulchre in Florence by Leon Battista Alberti. After winning the architecture competition for the Southwest Finland Agricultural Cooperative building in 1927, the Aaltos moved their office to Turku. They had made contact with the city&#x27;s most progressive architect, Erik Bryggman before moving. They began collaborating with him, most notably on the Turku Fair of 1928–29. Aalto&#x27;s biographer, Göran Schildt, claimed that Bryggman was the only architect with whom Aalto cooperated as an equal. With an increasing quantity of work in the Finnish capital, the Aaltos&#x27; office moved again in 1933 to Helsinki.

The Aaltos designed and built a joint house-office (1935–36) for themselves in Munkkiniemi, Helsinki, but later (1954–56) had a purpose-built office erected in the same neighbourhood – now the former is a &quot;home museum&quot; and the latter the premises of the Alvar Aalto Academy. In 1926, the young Aaltos designed and had built for themselves a summer cottage in Alajärvi, Villa Flora.

Aino and Alvar had two children, a daughter, Johanna &quot;Hanni&quot; (married surname Alanen; born 1925), and a son, Hamilkar Aalto (born 1928). Aino Aalto died of cancer in 1949.

In 1952, Aalto married architect Elissa Mäkiniemi (died 1994). In 1952, he designed and built a summer cottage, the so-called Experimental House, for himself and his second wife, now Elissa Aalto, in Muuratsalo in Central Finland. Alvar Aalto died on 11 May 1976, in Helsinki, and is buried in the Hietaniemi cemetery in Helsinki. Elissa Aalto became the director of the practice, running the office from 1976 to 1994. In 1978, the Museum of Finnish Architecture in Helsinki arranged a major exhibition of Aalto&#x27;s works.

==Architecture career==

===Early career: classicism===

Although he is sometimes regarded as among the first and most influential architects of Nordic modernism, closer examination reveals that Aalto (while a pioneer in Finland) closely followed and had personal contacts with other pioneers in Sweden, in particular Gunnar Asplund and Sven Markelius. What they and many others of that generation in the Nordic countries shared was a classical education and an approach to classical architecture that historians now call Nordic Classicism. It was a style that had been a reaction to the previous dominant style of National Romanticism before moving, in the late 1920s, towards Modernism.

Upon returning to Jyväskylä in 1923 to establish his own architect&#x27;s office, Aalto designed several single-family homes designed in the style of Nordic Classicism. For example, the manor-like house for his mother&#x27;s cousin Terho Manner in Töysa (1923), a summer villa for the Jyväskylä chief constable (also from 1923) and the Alatalo farmhouse in Tarvaala (1924). During this period he completed his first public buildings, the Jyväskylä Workers&#x27; Club in 1925, the Jyväskylä Defence Corps Building in 1926 and the Seinäjoki Civil Guard House building in 1924–29. He entered several architectural competitions for prestigious state public buildings, in Finland and abroad. This included two competitions for the Finnish Parliament building in 1923 and 1924, the extension to the University of Helsinki in 1931, and the building to house the League of Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1926–27. 

Aalto&#x27;s first church design to be completed, Muurame church, illustrates his transition from Nordic Classicism to Functionalism.

This was the period when Aalto was most prolific in his writings, with articles for professional journals and newspapers. Among his most well-known essays from this period are &quot;Urban culture&quot; (1924), &quot;Temple baths on Jyväskylä ridge&quot; (1925), &quot;Abbé Coignard&#x27;s sermon&quot; (1925), and &quot;From doorstep to living room&quot; (1926).



===Early career: functionalism===
The shift in Aalto&#x27;s design approach from classicism to modernism is epitomised by the Viipuri Library in Vyborg (1927–35), which went through a transformation from an originally classical competition entry proposal to the completed high-modernist building. His humanistic approach is in full evidence in the library: the interior displays natural materials, warm colours, and undulating lines. Due to problems related to financing, compounded by a change of site, the Viipuri Library project lasted eight years. During that time, Aalto designed the Standard Apartment Building (1928–29) in Turku, the Turun Sanomat Building (1929–30), and the Paimio Sanatorium (1929–32), which he designed in collaboration with his first wife Aino Aalto. A number of factors contributed to Aalto&#x27;s shift towards modernism: his increased familiarity with international trends, facilitated by his travels throughout Europe; the opportunity to experiment with concrete prefabrication in the Standard Apartment Building; the cutting-edge Le Corbusier-inspired formal language of the Turun Sanomat Building; and Aalto&#x27;s application of both in the Paimio Sanatorium and in the ongoing design for the library. Although the Turun Sanomat Building and Paimio Sanatorium are comparatively pure modernist works, they carried the seeds of his questioning of such an orthodox modernist approach and a move to a more daring, synthetic attitude. It has been pointed out that the planning principle for Paimio Sanatorium – the splayed wings – was indebted to the Zonnestraal Sanatorium (1925–31) by Jan Duiker, which Aalto visited while it was under construction. While these early Functionalist bear hallmarks of influences from Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius, and other key modernist figures of central Europe, Aalto nevertheless started to show his individuality in a departure from such norms with the introduction of organic references.

Through Sven Markelius, Aalto became a member of the Congres Internationaux d&#x27;Architecture Moderne (CIAM), attending the second congress in Frankfurt in 1929 and the fourth congress in Athens in 1933, where he established a close friendship with László Moholy-Nagy, Sigfried Giedion, and Philip Morton Shand. It was during this time that he closely followed the work of the main force driving the new modernism, Le Corbusier, visiting him in his Paris office several times in the following years.

It was not until the completion of the Paimio Sanatorium (1932) and Viipuri Library (1935) that Aalto first achieved world attention in architecture. His reputation grew in the US following the invitation to hold a retrospective exhibition of his works at MOMA in New York in 1938. (This was his first visit to the States.) The exhibition, which later went on a 12-city tour of the country, was a landmark: Aalto was the second-ever architect – after Le Corbusier – to have a solo exhibition at the museum. His reputation grew in the US following the critical reception of his design for the Finnish Pavilion at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair, described by Frank Lloyd Wright as a &quot;work of genius&quot;. It could be said that Aalto&#x27;s international reputation was sealed with his inclusion in the second edition of Sigfried Giedion&#x27;s influential book on Modernist architecture, &quot;Space, Time, and Architecture: The growth of a new tradition&quot; (1949), in which Aalto received more attention than any other Modernist architect, including Le Corbusier. In his analysis of Aalto, Giedion gave primacy to qualities that depart from direct functionality, such as mood, atmosphere, intensity of life, and even national characteristics, declaring that &quot;Finland is with Aalto wherever he goes.&quot;

===Mid career: experimentation===
During the 1930s Alvar spent some time experimenting with laminated wood, sculpture and abstract relief, characterized by irregular curved forms. Utilizing this knowledge, he was able to solve technical problems concerning the flexibility of wood while at the same time working out spatial issues in his designs. Aalto&#x27;s early experiments with wood and his move away from a purist modernism would be tested in built form with the commission to design Villa Mairea (1939) in Noormarkku, the luxury home of young industrialist couple Harry and Maire Gullichsen. It was Maire Gullichsen who acted as the main client, and she worked closely not only with Alvar but also with Aino Aalto on the design, encouraging them to be more daring in their work. The building forms a U-shape around a central inner &#x27;garden&#x27; whose central feature is a kidney-shaped swimming pool. Adjacent to the pool is a sauna executed in a rustic style, alluding to both Finnish and Japanese precedents. The design of the house is a synthesis of numerous stylistic influences, from traditional Finnish vernacular to purist modernism, as well as influences from English and Japanese architecture. While the house is clearly intended for a wealthy family, Aalto nevertheless argued that it was also an experiment that would prove useful in the design of mass housing.

His increased fame led to offers and commissions outside Finland. In 1941, he accepted an invitation as a visiting professor to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US. During the Second World War, he returned to Finland to direct the Reconstruction Office. After the war, he returned to MIT, where he designed the student dormitory Baker House, completed in 1949. The dormitory flanked the Charles River, and its undulating form provided maximum view and ventilation for each resident. This was the first building of Aalto&#x27;s redbrick period. Originally used in Baker House to signify the Ivy League university tradition, Aalto went on to use it in a number of key buildings after his return to Finland, most notably in several of the buildings in the new Helsinki University of Technology campus (starting in 1950), Säynätsalo Town Hall (1952), Helsinki Pensions Institute (1954), Helsinki House of Culture (1958), as well as in his own summer house, the Experimental House in Muuratsalo (1957).

In the 1950s Aalto immersed himself in sculpting, exploring wood, bronze, marble, and mixed media. Among the notable works from this period is his 1960 memorial to the Battle of Suomussalmi. Located on the battlefield, it consists of a leaning bronze pillar on a pedestal.

===Mature career: monumentalism===

Foremost among Aalto&#x27;s work from the early 1960s until his death in 1976 were his projects in Helsinki, in particular the huge town plan for the void in the centre of Helsinki adjacent to Töölö Bay and the vast railway yards, an area marked on the edges by significant buildings such as the National Museum and the main railway station, both by Eliel Saarinen. In his town plan, Aalto proposed a line of separate marble-clad buildings fronting the bay, which would house various cultural institutions, including a concert hall, opera, museum of architecture, and headquarters for the Finnish Academy. The scheme also extended into the Kamppi district with a series of tall office blocks. Aalto first presented his vision in 1961, but it went through various modifications during the early &#x27;60s. Only two fragments of the overall plan were realized: the Finlandia Hall concert hall (1976) fronting on Töölö Bay and an office building in the Kamppi district for the Helsinki Electricity Company (1975). Aalto also employed the Miesian formal language of geometric grids used in those buildings for other sites in Helsinki, including the Enso-Gutzeit headquarters building (1962), the Academic Bookstore (1962), and the SYP Bank building (1969).

Following Aalto&#x27;s death in 1976, his office continued to operate under the direction of his widow Elissa, who oversaw the completion of works already designed (to some extent), among them the Jyväskylä City Theatre and Essen opera house. Since the death of Elissa Aalto, the office has continued to operate as the Alvar Aalto Academy, giving advice on the restoration of Aalto buildings and organizing the practice&#x27;s vast archives.

==Furniture career==

Although Aalto was famous for his architecture, his furniture designs were admired and are still popular today. He studied with the architect-designer Josef Hoffmann at the Wiener Werkstätte(engl.: &quot;Vienna Workshop&quot;) and worked, for a time, under Eliel Saarinen. He also drew inspiration from Gebrüder Thonet. During the late 1920s and 1930s, he worked closely with Aino Aalto on his furniture designs, a focus due in part to his decision to design many of the individual furniture pieces and lamps for the Paimio Sanatorium. Of particular significance was the Aaltos&#x27; experimentation in bent plywood chairs, most notably the so-called Paimio chair, designed for tuberculosis patients, and the Model 60 stacking stool. The Aaltos, together with visual arts promoter Maire Gullichsen and art historian Nils-Gustav Hahl, founded the Artek company in 1935, ostensibly to sell Aalto products but which also imported pieces by other designers. Aalto became the first furniture designer to use the cantilever principle in chair designs using wood.

==Awards==
Aalto&#x27;s awards included the Prince Eugen Medal in 1954, the Royal Gold Medal for Architecture from the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1957 and the Gold Medal from the American Institute of Architects in 1963. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1957. He also was a member of the Academy of Finland, and was its president from 1963 to 1968. From 1925 to 1956 he was a member of the Congrès International d&#x27;Architecture Moderne. In 1960 he received an honorary doctorate at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).

==Works==
Aalto&#x27;s career spans the changes in style from (Nordic Classicism) to purist International Style Modernism to a more personal, synthetic, and idiosyncratic Modernism. Aalto&#x27;s wide field of design activity ranges from large-scale projects such as city planning and architecture to more intimate, human-scale work in interior design, furniture and glassware design, and painting. It has been estimated that during his entire career Aalto designed over 500 individual buildings, approximately 300 of which were built. The vast majority of them are in Finland. He also has a few buildings in France, Germany, Italy, and the US.

Aalto&#x27;s work with wood was influenced by early Scandinavian architects. His experiments and bold departures from aesthetic norms brought attention to his ability to make wood do things not previously done. His techniques in the way he cut beech wood, for example, and his ability to use plywood as a structural element while at the same time exploiting its aesthetic properties, were at once technically innovative and artistically inspired. Other examples of his boundary-pushing sensibility include the vertical placement of rough-hewn logs at his pavilion at the Lapua expo, a design element that evoked a medieval barricade. At the orchestra platform at Turku and the Paris expo at the World Fair, he used varying sizes and shapes of planks. Also at Paris (and at Villa Mairea), he utilized birch boards in a vertical arrangement. His Vyborg Library, built in what was then Viipuri (it became Vyborg after Soviet annexation in 1944), is acclaimed for its stunning ceiling, with its undulating waves of red-hearted pine (which grows in the region ). In his roofing, he created massive spans (155-foot at the covered stadium at Otaniemi), all without tie rods. In his stairway at Villa Mairea, he evokes the feeling of a natural forest by binding beech wood with withes into columns.

Aalto claimed that his paintings were not made as individual artworks but as part of his process of architectural design, and many of his small-scale &quot;sculptural&quot; experiments with wood led to later larger architectural details and forms. These experiments also led to a number of patents: for example, he invented a new form of laminated bent-plywood furniture in 1932 (which was patented in 1933). His experimental method had been influenced by his meetings with various members of the Bauhaus design school, especially László Moholy-Nagy, whom he first met in 1930. Aalto&#x27;s furniture was exhibited in London in 1935, to great critical acclaim. To cope with the consumer demand, Aalto, together with his wife Aino, Maire Gullichsen, and Nils-Gustav Hahl founded the company Artek that same year. Aalto glassware (Aino as well as Alvar) is manufactured by Iittala.

Aalto&#x27;s &#x27;High Stool&#x27; and &#x27;Stool E60&#x27; (manufactured by Artek) are currently used in Apple Stores across the world to serve as seating for customers. Finished in black lacquer, the stools are used to seat customers at the &#x27;Genius Bar&#x27; and also in other areas of the store at times when seating is required for a product workshop or special event. Aalto was also influential in bringing modern art to the attention of the Finnish people, in particular the work of his friends Alexander Milne Calder and Fernand Léger.

==Quotations==
* &quot;God created paper for the purpose of drawing architecture on it. Everything else, at least for me, is a misuse of paper.&quot; Alvar Aalto, &quot;In lieu of an article&quot;, &quot;Arkkitehti&quot; no. 1-2, 1958.
* &quot;We should work for simple, good, undecorated things...things which are in harmony with the human being and organically suited to the little man in the street.&quot; Alvar Aalto, speech in London 1957.
* &quot;It’s not an art to take and copy everything from tradition or past. It’s necessary to take the material and energy from nature and respond with the work of art, bringing your own psychical energy into it. We are prone to take everything from nature without giving anything in return. That’s not good – it can take a revenge on us.”

==Critique of Aalto&#x27;s architecture==
As mentioned above, Aalto&#x27;s international reputation was sealed with his inclusion in the second edition of Sigfried Giedion&#x27;s influential book on Modernist architecture, &quot;Space, Time and Architecture: The growth of a new tradition&quot; (1949), in which Aalto received more attention than any other Modernist architect, including Le Corbusier. In his analysis of Aalto, Giedion gave primacy to qualities that depart from direct functionality, such as mood, atmosphere, intensity of life and even national characteristics, declaring that &quot;Finland is with Aalto wherever he goes.&quot;

More recently, however, some architecture critics and historians have questioned Aalto&#x27;s influence on the historical canon. The Italian Marxist architecture historians Manfredo Tafuri and Francesco Dal Co contend that Aalto&#x27;s &quot;historical significance has perhaps been rather exaggerated; with Aalto we are outside of the great themes that have made the course of contemporary architecture so dramatic. The qualities of his works have a meaning only as masterful distractions, not subject to reproduction outside the remote reality [sic] in which they have their roots.&quot; At the heart of their critique was the perception of Aalto&#x27;s work as unsuited to the urban context: &quot;Essentially, his architecture is not appropriate to urban typologies.&quot;

At the other end of the political spectrum (though similarly concerned with the appropriateness of Aalto&#x27;s formal language), the American cultural theorist and architectural historian Charles Jencks singled out his Pensions Institute as an example of what he termed the architect&#x27;s &quot;soft paternalism&quot;: &quot;Conceived as a fragmented mass to break up the feeling of bureaucracy, it succeeds all too well in being humane and killing the pensioner with kindness. The forms are familiar – red brick and ribbon-strip windows broken by copper and bronze elements – all carried through with a literal-mindedness that borders on the soporific.&quot;

During his lifetime, Aalto faced criticisms from his fellow architects in Finland, most notably Kirmo Mikkola and Juhani Pallasmaa. By the last decade of Aalto&#x27;s life, his work was seen as unfashionably individualistic at a time when the opposing tendencies of rationalism and constructivism – often championed under left-wing politics – argued for anonymous, aggressively non-aesthetic architecture. Of Aalto&#x27;s late works, Mikkola wrote, &quot;Aalto has moved to [a] baroque line...&quot;

==Memorials==
Aalto has been commemorated in a number of ways:
* Alvar Aalto is the eponym of the Alvar Aalto Medal, an international architecture award.
* Aalto was featured in the 50 mk note in the last series of the Finnish markka (before its replacement by the Euro in 2002).
* The centenary of Aalto&#x27;s birth in 1998 was marked in Finland not only by several books and exhibitions, but also by the promotion of specially bottled red and white Aalto Wine and a specially designed cupcake.
* In 1976, the year of his death, Aalto was commemorated on a Finnish postage stamp.
* Piazza Alvar Aalto, a square named after Aalto, can be found in the Porta Nuova business district of Milan, Italy.
* Aalto University, a Finnish university formed by merging Helsinki University of Technology, Helsinki School of Economics and TaiK in 2010, is named after Alvar Aalto.
* An Alvar Aallon katu (Alvar Aalto Street) can be found in five different Finnish cities: Helsinki, Jyväskylä, Oulu, Kotka and Seinäjoki.
* In 2017, the Alvar Aalto Museum launched Alvar Aalto Cities, that is, a network of cities containing buildings by Alvar Aalto. The objective of the network is to increase awareness of Aalto&#x27;s work both in Finland and abroad. It is hoped that by combining forces on communications and marketing, the visibility and accessibility of exhibitions, tourist attractions and events will be improved. To date, the network city members are: Aalborg, Alajärvi, Espoo, Eura, Hamina, Helsinki, Imatra, Jyväskylä, Järvenpää, Kotka, Kouvola, Lahti, Oulu, Paimio, Pori, Raseborg, Rovaniemi, Seinäjoki, Turku, Vantaa and Varkaus. It is estimated that in total there would be 40 cities worldwide that would qualify as an Alvar Aalto City.

<doc id="2011" wikidata="Q840832" url="?curid=2011" title="Comparison of American and British English">
<text>The English language was introduced to the Americas by the arrival of the English, beginning in the late 16th century. The language also spread to numerous other parts of the world as a result of British trade and settlement and the spread of the former British Empire, which, by 1921, included 470–570 million people, about a quarter of the world&#x27;s population. In England, Wales, Ireland and especially parts of Scotland there are differing varieties of the English language, so the term &#x27;British English&#x27; is an oversimplification. Likewise, spoken American English varies widely across the country. Written forms of British and American English as found in newspapers and textbooks vary little in their essential features, with only occasional noticeable differences.

Over the past 400 years, the forms of the language used in the Americas—especially in the United States—and that used in the United Kingdom have diverged in a few minor ways, leading to the versions now often referred to as American English and British English. Differences between the two include pronunciation, grammar, vocabulary (lexis), spelling, punctuation, idioms, and formatting of dates and numbers. However, the differences in written and most spoken grammar structure tend to be much fewer than in other aspects of the language in terms of mutual intelligibility. A few words have completely different meanings in the two versions or are even unknown or not used in one of the versions. One particular contribution towards integrating these differences came from Noah Webster, who wrote the first American dictionary (published 1828) with the intention of unifying the disparate dialects across the United States and codifying North American vocabulary which was not present in British dictionaries.

This divergence between American English and British English has provided opportunities for humorous comment: e.g. in fiction George Bernard Shaw says that the United States and United Kingdom are &quot;two countries divided by a common language&quot;; and Oscar Wilde says that &quot;We have really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of course, the language&quot; (&quot;The Canterville Ghost&quot;, 1888). Henry Sweet incorrectly predicted in 1877 that within a century American English, Australian English and British English would be mutually unintelligible (&quot;A Handbook of Phonetics&quot;). Perhaps increased worldwide communication through radio, television, and the Internet has tended to reduce regional variation. This can lead to some variations becoming extinct (for instance &quot;the wireless&quot; being progressively superseded by &quot;the radio&quot;) or the acceptance of wide variations as &quot;perfectly good English&quot; everywhere.

Although spoken American and British English are generally mutually intelligible, there are occasional differences which may cause embarrassment—for example, in American English a &quot;rubber&quot; is usually interpreted as a &quot;condom&quot; rather than an &quot;eraser&quot;.

==Word derivation and compounds==
* Directional suffix &quot;-ward(s)&quot;: British &quot;forwards&quot;, &quot;towards&quot;, &quot;rightwards&quot;, etc.; American &quot;forward&quot;, &quot;toward&quot;, &quot;rightward&quot;. In both varieties distribution varies somewhat: &quot;afterwards&quot;, &quot;towards&quot;, and &quot;backwards&quot; are not unusual in America; while in the United Kingdom &quot;upward&quot; and &quot;rightward&quot; are the more common options, as is &quot;forward&quot;, which is standard in phrasal verbs such as &quot;look forward to&quot;. The forms with &quot;-s&quot; may be used as adverbs (or preposition &quot;towards&quot;) but rarely as adjectives: in the UK, as in America, one says &quot;an upward motion&quot;. The Oxford English Dictionary in 1897 suggested a semantic distinction for adverbs, with &quot;-wards&quot; having a more definite directional sense than &quot;-ward&quot;; subsequent authorities such as Fowler have disputed this contention. 
* American English (AmE) freely adds the suffix &quot;-s&quot; to &quot;day&quot;, &quot;night&quot;, &quot;evening&quot;, &quot;weekend&quot;, &quot;Monday&quot;, etc. to form adverbs denoting repeated or customary action: &quot;I used to stay out evenings&quot;; &quot;the library is closed on Saturdays&quot;. This usage has its roots in Old English but many of these constructions are now regarded as American (for example, the OED labels &quot;nights&quot; &quot;now chiefly N. Amer. colloq.&quot; in constructions such as &quot;to sleep nights&quot;, but &quot;to work nights&quot; is standard in British English).
* In British English (BrE), the agentive &quot;-er&quot; suffix is commonly attached to &quot;football&quot; to refer to one who plays the sport (also &quot;cricket&quot;; often &quot;netball&quot;; occasionally &quot;basketball&quot; and &quot;volleyball&quot;). AmE usually uses &quot;football player&quot;. Where the sport&#x27;s name is usable as a verb, the suffixation is standard in both varieties: for example, &quot;golfer&quot;, &quot;bowler&quot; (in ten-pin bowling and in lawn bowls), and &quot;shooter&quot;. AmE appears sometimes to use the form &quot;baller&quot; as slang for a basketball player, as in the video game &quot;NBA Ballers&quot;. However, this is derived from slang use of &quot;to ball&quot; as a verb meaning to play basketball.
* English writers everywhere occasionally make new compound words from common phrases; for example, &quot;health care&quot; is now being replaced by &quot;healthcare&quot; on both sides of the Atlantic. However, AmE has made certain words in this fashion that are still treated as phrases in BrE.
* In compound nouns of the form &lt;verb&gt;&lt;noun&gt;, sometimes AmE prefers the bare infinitive where BrE prefers the gerund. Examples include (AmE first): &quot;jump rope&quot;/&quot;skipping rope&quot;; &quot;racecar&quot;/&quot;racing car&quot;; &quot;rowboat&quot;/&quot;rowing boat&quot;; &quot;sailboat&quot;/&quot;sailing boat&quot;; &quot;file cabinet&quot;/&quot;filing cabinet&quot;; &quot;dial tone&quot;/&quot;dialling tone&quot;; &quot;drainboard&quot;/&quot;draining board&quot;.
* Generally AmE has a tendency to drop inflectional suffixes, thus preferring clipped forms: compare &quot;cookbook&quot; v. &quot;cookery book&quot;; &quot;Smith, age 40&quot; v. &quot;Smith, aged 40&quot;; &quot;skim milk&quot; v. &quot;skimmed milk&quot;; &quot;dollhouse&quot; v. &quot;dolls&#x27; house&quot;; &quot;barber shop&quot; v. &quot;barber&#x27;s shop&quot;.
* Singular attributives in one country may be plural in the other, and &quot;vice versa&quot;. For example, the UK has a &quot;drugs problem&quot;, while the United States has a &quot;drug problem&quot; (although the singular usage is also commonly heard in the UK); Americans read the &quot;sports&quot; section of a newspaper; the British are more likely to read the &quot;sport&quot; section. However, BrE &quot;maths&quot; is singular, like &quot;physics&quot;, just as AmE &quot;math&quot; is: both are abbreviations of &quot;mathematics&quot;.
* Some British English words come from French roots, while American English finds its words from other places, e.g. AmE &quot;eggplant&quot; and &quot;zucchini&quot; are &quot;aubergine&quot; and &quot;courgette&quot; in BrE.
* Similarly, American English has occasionally replaced more traditional English words with their Spanish counterparts. This is especially common in regions historically affected by Spanish settlement (such as the American Southwest and Florida) as well as other areas that have since experienced strong Hispanic migration (such as urban areas). Examples of these include grocery markets&#x27; preference in the U.S. for Spanish names such as cilantro and manzanilla over coriander and camomile respectively.

==Pronunciation==

Several pronunciation patterns contrast American and British English accents. The following lists a few common ones.

Most American accents are rhotic, preserving the historical phoneme in all contexts, while most British accents of England and Wales are non-rhotic, only preserving this sound before vowels but dropping it in all other contexts; thus, &quot;farmer&quot; rhymes with &quot;llama&quot; for Brits but not Americans. American accents tend to raise the tongue whenever the phoneme (in words like ) occurs before the consonants and . British accents distinguish the vowel sounds in , , and , while American accents merge the and vowels together, and about 50% of Americans additionally merge the vowel with the previous two, so for example &quot;odd&quot;, &quot;façade&quot;, and &quot;thawed&quot; can all rhyme. Many regional and informal accents of England, but none in North America, exhibit H-dropping. Words like &quot;bitter&quot; and &quot;bidder&quot; are pronounced the same in North America, but not England, due to a phenomenon called flapping involving and between vowels. British accents pronounce between vowels in other ways than Americans, including with a glottal stop or with an aspirated .

==Vocabulary==
The familiarity of speakers with words and phrases from different regions varies, and the difficulty of discerning an unfamiliar definition also depends on the context and the term. As expressions spread with telecommunications, they are often but not always understood as foreign to the speaker&#x27;s dialect, and words from other dialects may carry connotations with regard to register, social status, origin, and intelligence.

=== Words and phrases with different meanings ===

Words such as &quot;bill&quot; and &quot;biscuit&quot; are used regularly in both AmE and BrE but can mean different things in each form. The word &quot;bill&quot; has several meanings, most of which are shared between AmE and BrE. However, in AmE &quot;bill&quot; often refers to a piece of paper money (as in a &quot;dollar bill&quot;) which in BrE is more commonly referred to as a note. In AmE it can also refer to the visor of a cap, though this is by no means common. In AmE a biscuit (from the French &quot;twice baked&quot; as in biscotto) is a soft bready product that is known in BrE as a scone or a specifically hard, sweet biscuit. Meanwhile, a BrE biscuit incorporates both dessert biscuits and AmE cookies (from the Dutch &#x27;little cake&#x27;).

As chronicled by Winston Churchill, the opposite meanings of the verb &quot;to table&quot; created a misunderstanding during a meeting of the Allied forces; in BrE to table an item on an agenda means to &quot;open it up&quot; for discussion whereas in AmE, it means to &quot;remove&quot; it from discussion, or at times, to suspend or delay discussion; e.g. &quot;Let&#x27;s table that topic for later&quot;. Similarly, the word &quot;moot&quot; (and &quot;moot point&quot;) in BrE means &#x27;remains open to debate&#x27; whereas in AmE, it means &#x27;of no practical significance&#x27;, irrelevant.

The word &quot;football&quot; in BrE refers to association football, also known in the US as soccer. In AmE, &quot;football&quot; means American football. The standard AmE term &quot;soccer&quot;, a contraction of &quot;association (football)&quot;, is actually of British origin, derived from the ratification of different codes of football in the 19th century, and was a fairly unremarkable usage (possibly marked for class) in BrE until later; in Britain it became perceived as an Americanism. In non-American and non-Canadian contexts, particularly in sports news from outside the United States and Canada, American (or US branches of foreign) news agencies and media companies also use &quot;football&quot; to mean &quot;soccer&quot;, especially in direct quotes.

Similarly, the word &quot;hockey&quot; in BrE often refers to field hockey and in AmE, &quot;hockey&quot; usually means ice hockey.

Words with completely different meanings are relatively few; most of the time there are either (1) words with one or more shared meanings and one or more meanings unique to one variety (for example, bathroom and toilet) or (2) words the meanings of which are actually common to both BrE and AmE but that show differences in frequency, connotation or denotation (for example, &quot;smart&quot;, &quot;clever&quot;, &quot;mad&quot;).

Some differences in usage and meaning can cause confusion or embarrassment. For example, the word &quot;fanny&quot; is a slang word for vulva in BrE but means buttocks in AmE, hence the AmE phrase &quot;fanny pack&quot; is &quot;bum bag&quot; in BrE. In AmE the word &quot;pissed&quot; means being annoyed or angry whereas in BrE it is a coarse word for being drunk (in both varieties, &quot;pissed off&quot; means irritated).

Similarly, in AmE the word &quot;pants&quot; is the common word for the BrE &quot;trousers&quot; and (in AmE) &quot;knickers&quot; refers to a variety of half-length trousers (though most AmE users would use the term &quot;shorts&quot; rather than knickers), while the majority of BrE speakers would understand &quot;pants&quot; to mean &quot;underpants&quot; and &quot;knickers&quot; to mean &quot;female underpants&quot;.

Sometimes the confusion is more subtle. In AmE the word &quot;quite&quot; used as a qualifier is generally a reinforcement, though it is somewhat uncommon in actual colloquial American use today and carries an air of formality: for example, &quot;I&#x27;m quite hungry&quot; is a very polite way to say &quot;I&#x27;m very hungry&quot;. In BrE &quot;quite&quot; (which is much more common in conversation) may have this meaning, as in &quot;quite right&quot; or &quot;quite mad&quot;, but it more commonly means &quot;somewhat&quot;, so that in BrE &quot;I&#x27;m quite hungry&quot; can mean &quot;I&#x27;m somewhat hungry&quot;. This divergence of use can lead to misunderstanding.

===Different terms in different dialects===
Most speakers of American English are aware of some uniquely British terms. It is generally very easy to guess what some words, such as BrE &quot;driving licence&quot;, mean, the AmE equivalent being &quot;driver&#x27;s license&quot;. However, use of many other British words such as &quot;naff&quot; (slang but commonly used to mean &quot;not very good&quot;) are unheard of in American English.

Speakers of BrE usually find it easy to understand most common AmE terms, such as &quot;sidewalk (pavement or footpath)&quot;, &quot;gas (gasoline/petrol)&quot;, &quot;counterclockwise (anticlockwise)&quot; or &quot;elevator (lift)&quot;, thanks in large part to considerable exposure to American popular culture and literature. Terms heard less often, especially when rare or absent in American popular culture, such as &quot;copacetic (very satisfactory)&quot;, are unlikely to be understood by most BrE speakers.

Other examples:
* In the UK the word &quot;whilst&quot; is commonly used as a conjunction (as an alternative to &quot;while&quot;, especially prevalent in some dialects). &quot;whilst&quot; tends to appear in non-temporal senses, as when used to point out a contrast. In AmE &quot;while&quot; is used in both contexts, with &quot;whilst&quot; being much more uncommon. Other words with the &quot;-st&quot; ending are also found even in AmE as much as in BrE, despite being old-fashioned or an affectation (e.g., &quot;unbeknownst&quot;, &quot;midst&quot;). Historically, the word &quot;against&quot; falls into this category also, and is standard in both varieties.
* In the UK generally the use of &quot;fall&quot; to mean &quot;autumn&quot; is obsolete. Although found often from Elizabethan literature to Victorian literature, the seasonal use of &quot;fall&quot; remains easily understandable to BrE speakers only because it is so commonly used that way in the U.S.
*In the UK the term &quot;period&quot; for a full stop is not used; in AmE the term &quot;full stop&quot; is rarely, if ever, used for the punctuation mark and commonly not understood whatsoever. For example, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said, &quot;Terrorism is wrong, full stop&quot;, whereas in AmE, the equivalent sentence is &quot;Terrorism is wrong, period.&quot; The use of &quot;period&quot; as an interjection meaning &quot;and nothing else; end of discussion&quot; is beginning to be used in colloquial British English, though sometimes without conscious reference to punctuation.
* In the US, the word &quot;line&quot; is used to refer to a line of people, vehicles, or other objects, while in the UK &quot;queue&quot; refers to that meaning. In the US, the word &quot;queue&quot; is most commonly used to refer to the computing sense of a data structure in which objects are added to one end and removed from the other. In the US, the equivalent terms to &quot;queue up&quot; and &quot;wait in queue&quot; are &quot;line up&quot; or &quot;get in line&quot; and &quot;wait in line.&quot; The equivalent term to &quot;jumping the queue&quot; is &quot;cutting in line.&quot;

===Holiday greetings===

It is increasingly common for Americans to say &quot;Happy holidays&quot;, referring to all, or at least multiple, winter (in the Northern hemisphere) or summer (in the Southern hemisphere) holidays (Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, etc.) especially when one&#x27;s religious observances are not known; the phrase is rarely heard in the UK. In the UK, the phrases &quot;holiday season&quot; and &quot;holiday period&quot; refer to the period in the summer when most people take time off from work, and travel; AmE does not use &quot;holiday&quot; in this sense, instead using &quot;vacation&quot; for recreational excursions.

In AmE, the prevailing Christmas greeting is &quot;Merry Christmas&quot;, which is the traditional English Christmas greeting, as found in the English Christmas carol &quot;We Wish You a Merry Christmas&quot;, and which appears several times in Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. In BrE, &quot;Happy Christmas&quot; is a common alternative to &quot;Merry Christmas&quot;.

===Idiosyncratic differences===

====Omission of &quot;and&quot; and &quot;on&quot;====

Generally in British English, numbers with a value over one hundred have the word &quot;and&quot; inserted before the last two digits. For example, the number 115, when written in words or spoken aloud, would be &quot;One hundred &quot;and&quot; fifteen&quot;, in British English. In American English, numbers are typically said or written in words in the same way, however if the word &quot;and&quot; is omitted (&quot;One hundred fifteen&quot;), this is also considered acceptable (in BrE this would be considered grammatically incorrect).

Likewise, in the US, the word &quot;on&quot; can be left out when referring to events occurring on any particular day of the week. The US possibility &quot;The Cowboys won the game Sunday&quot; would have the equivalent in the UK of &quot;Sheffield United won the match on Sunday.&quot;

====Figures of speech====
Both BrE and AmE use the expression &quot;I couldn&#x27;t care less&quot;, to mean that the speaker does not care at all. Some Americans use &quot;I could care less&quot; to mean the same thing. This variant is frequently derided as sloppy, as the literal meaning of the words is that the speaker &quot;does&quot; care to some extent.

In both areas, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t mind&quot; often means, &quot;I&#x27;m not annoyed&quot; (for example, by someone&#x27;s smoking), while &quot;I don&#x27;t care&quot; often means, &quot;The matter is trivial or boring&quot;. However, in answering a question such as &quot;Tea or coffee?&quot;, if either alternative is equally acceptable an American may answer, &quot;I don&#x27;t care&quot;, while a British person may answer, &quot;I don&#x27;t mind&quot;. Either can sound odd, confusing, or rude, to those accustomed to the other variant.

&quot;To be &quot;all set&quot; in both BrE and AmE can mean &quot;to be prepared or ready&quot;, though it appears to be more common in AmE. It can also have an additional meaning in AmE of &quot;to be finished or done&quot;, for example, a customer at a restaurant telling a waiter &quot;I&#x27;m all set. I&#x27;ll take the check.&quot;

====Equivalent idioms====
A number of English idioms that have essentially the same meaning show lexical differences between the British and the American version; for instance:
 In the US, a &quot;carpet&quot; typically refers to a fitted carpet, rather than a rug.

===Social and cultural differences===

Lexical items that reflect separate social and cultural development.

====Education====

=====Primary and secondary school=====

The US has a more uniform nationwide system of terms than does the UK, where terminology and structure varies among constituent countries, but the division by grades varies somewhat among the states and even among local school districts. For example, &quot;elementary school&quot; often includes kindergarten and may include sixth grade, with &quot;middle school&quot; including only two grades or extending to ninth grade. 

In the UK, the US equivalent of a &quot;high school&quot; is often referred to as a &quot;secondary school&quot; regardless of whether it is state funded or private. US Secondary education also includes &quot;middle school&quot; or &quot;junior high school&quot;, a two- or three-year transitional school between elementary school and high school. &quot;Middle school&quot; is sometimes used in the UK as a synonym for the younger &quot;junior school&quot;, covering the second half of the primary curriculum, current years four to six in some areas. However, in Dorset (South England), it is used to describe the second school in the three-tier system, which is normally from year 5 to year 8. In other regions, such as Evesham and the surrounding area in Worcestershire, the second tier goes from year 6 to year 8, and both starting secondary school in year nine. In Kirklees, West Yorkshire, in the villages of the Dearne Valley there is a three tier system: first schools year reception to year five, middle school (Scissett/Kirkburton Middle School) year 6 to year 8, and high school year 9 to year 13.

A &quot;public school&quot; has opposite meanings in the two countries. In American English this is a government-owned institution open to all students, supported by public funding. The British English use of the term is in the context of &quot;private&quot; education: to be educated privately with a tutor. In England and Wales the term strictly refers to an ill-defined group of prestigious private independent schools funded by students&#x27; fees, although it is often more loosely used to refer to any independent school. Independent schools are also known as &quot;private schools&quot;, and the latter is the term used in Scotland and Northern Ireland for all such fee-funded schools. Strictly, the term &quot;public school&quot; is not used in Scotland and Northern Ireland in the same sense as in England, but nevertheless Gordonstoun, the Scottish private school, is sometimes referred to as a &quot;public school&quot;, as are some other Scottish private schools. Government-funded schools in Scotland and Northern Ireland are properly referred to as &quot;state schools&quot; but are sometimes confusingly referred to as &quot;public schools&quot; (with the same meaning as in the US), and in the US, where most public schools are administered by local governments, a &quot;state school&quot; typically refers to a college or university run by one of the U.S. states. 

Speakers in both the United States and the United Kingdom use several additional terms for specific types of secondary school. A US &quot;prep school&quot; or &quot;preparatory school&quot; is an independent school funded by tuition fees; the same term is used in the UK for a private school for pupils under 13, designed to prepare them for fee-paying public schools. In the US, &quot;Catholic schools&quot; cover costs through tuition and have affiliations with a religious institution, most often a Catholic church or diocese. In England, where the state-funded education system grew from parish schools arranged by the local established church, the Church of England (C of E, or CE), and many schools, especially primary schools (up to age 11) retain a church connection and are known as &quot;church schools&quot;, &quot;CE schools&quot; or &quot;CE (aided) schools&quot;. There are also &quot;faith schools&quot; associated with the Roman Catholic Church and other major faiths, with a mixture of funding arrangements. In Scotland, Catholic schools are generally operated as government-funded state schools for Catholic communities, particularly in large cities such as Glasgow.

In the US, a &quot;magnet school&quot; receives government funding and has special admission requirements: in some cases pupils gain admission through superior performance on admission tests, while other magnet schools admit students through a lottery. The UK has city academies, which are independent privately sponsored schools run with public funding and which can select up to 10% of pupils by aptitude. Moreover, in the UK 36 local education authorities retain selection by ability at 11. They maintain grammar schools (state funded secondary schools), which admit pupils according to performance in an examination (known as the 11+) and comprehensive schools that take pupils of all abilities. Grammar schools select the most academically able 10% to 23% of those who sit the exam. Students who fail the exam go to a secondary modern school, sometimes called a &quot;high school&quot;, or increasingly an &quot;academy&quot;. In areas where there are no grammar schools the comprehensives likewise may term themselves high schools or academies. Nationally only 6% of pupils attend grammar schools, mainly in four distinct counties. Some private schools are called &quot;grammar schools&quot;, chiefly those that were grammar schools long before the advent of state education.

=====University=====
In the UK a university student is said to &quot;study&quot;, to &quot;read&quot; or, informally, simply to &quot;do&quot; a subject. In the recent past the expression &#x27;to read a subject&#x27; was more common at the older universities such as Oxford and Cambridge. In the US a student &quot;studies&quot; or &quot;majors in&quot; a subject (although a student&#x27;s &quot;major&quot;, &quot;concentration&quot; or, less commonly, &quot;emphasis&quot; is also used in US colleges or universities to refer to the major subject of study). &quot;To major in&quot; something refers to the student&#x27;s principal course of study; &quot;to study&quot; may refer to any class being taken. 

BrE: 

AmE: 

At university level in BrE, each &quot;module&quot; is taught or facilitated by a &quot;lecturer&quot; or &quot;tutor&quot;; &quot;professor&quot; is the job-title of a senior academic (in AmE, at some universities, the equivalent of the BrE lecturer is instructor, especially when the teacher has a lesser degree or no university degree, though the usage may become confusing according to whether the subject being taught is considered technical or not; it is also different from adjunct instructor/professor). In AmE each &quot;class&quot; is generally taught by a &quot;professor&quot; (although some US tertiary educational institutions follow the BrE usage), while the position of &quot;lecturer&quot; is occasionally given to individuals hired on a temporary basis to teach one or more classes and who may or may not have a doctoral degree. 

The word &quot;course&quot; in American use typically refers to the study of a restricted topic or individual subject (for example, &quot;a course in Early Medieval England&quot;, &quot;a course in integral calculus&quot;) over a limited period of time (such as a semester or term) and is equivalent to a &quot;module&quot; or sometimes &quot;unit&quot; at a British university. In the UK, a &quot;course of study&quot; or simply &quot;course&quot; is likely to refer to the entire curriculum, which may extend over several years and be made up of any number of &quot;modules,&quot; hence it is also practically synonymous to a degree programme. A few university-specific exceptions exist: for example, at Cambridge the word &quot;paper&quot; is used to refer to a &quot;module&quot;, while the whole course of study is called &quot;tripos&quot;. 

A &quot;dissertation&quot; in AmE refers to the final written product of a doctoral student to meet the requirement of that curriculum. In BrE, the same word refers to the final written product of a student in an undergraduate or taught master&#x27;s programme. A dissertation in the AmE sense would be a thesis in BrE, though &quot;dissertation&quot; is also used. 

Another source of confusion is the different usage of the word &quot;college&quot;. (See a full international discussion of the various meanings at college.) In the US, it refers to a post-high school institution that grants either associate&#x27;s or bachelor&#x27;s degrees, and in the UK, it refers to any post-secondary institution that is not a university (including &quot;sixth form college&quot; after the name in secondary education for years 12 and 13, the &quot;sixth form&quot;) where intermediary courses such as A levels or NVQs can be taken and GCSE courses can be retaken. College may sometimes be used in the UK or in Commonwealth countries as part of the name of a secondary or high school (for example, Dubai College). In the case of the universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Aberdeen, London, Lancaster, Durham, Kent and York, all members are also members of a college which is part of the university, for example, one is a member of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge and hence of the university. 

In both the US and UK &quot;college&quot; can refer to some division within a university that comprises related academic departments such as the &quot;college of business and economics&quot; though in the UK &quot;faculty&quot; is more often used. Institutions in the US that offer two to four years of post-high school education often have the word &quot;college&quot; as part of their name, while those offering more advanced degrees are called a &quot;university&quot;. (There are exceptions: Boston College, Dartmouth College and the College of William &amp; Mary are examples of colleges that offer advanced degrees, while Vincennes University is an unusual example of a &quot;university&quot; that offers only associate degrees in the vast majority of its academic programmes). American students who pursue a &quot;bachelor&#x27;s degree&quot; (four years of higher education) or an &quot;associate degree&quot; (two years of higher education) are &quot;college students&quot; regardless of whether they attend a college or a university and refer to their educational institutions informally as &quot;colleges.&quot; A student who pursues a master&#x27;s degree or a doctorate degree in the arts and sciences is in AmE a &quot;graduate student&quot;; in BrE a &quot;postgraduate student&quot; although &quot;graduate student&quot; is also sometimes used. Students of advanced professional programmes are known by their field (&quot;business student&quot;, &quot;law student&quot;, &quot;medical student&quot;). Some universities also have a residential college system, the details of which may vary but generally involve common living and dining spaces as well as college-planned activities. Nonetheless, when it comes to the level of education, AmE generally uses the word &quot;college&quot; (e.g., going to college) whereas BrE generally uses the word &quot;university&quot; (e.g., going to university) regardless of the institution&#x27;s official designation/status in both countries. 

In the context of higher education, the word &quot;school&quot; is used slightly differently in BrE and AmE. In BrE, except for the University of London, the word school is used to refer to an academic department in a university. In AmE, the word school is used to refer to a collection of related academic departments and is headed by a dean. When it refers to a division of a university, school is practically synonymous to a college. 

&quot;Professor&quot; has different meanings in BrE and AmE. In BrE it is the highest academic rank, followed by reader, senior lecturer and lecturer. In AmE &quot;professor&quot; refers to academic staff of all ranks, with (full) professor (largely equivalent to the UK meaning) followed by associate professor and assistant professor. 

&quot;Tuition&quot; has traditionally had separate meaning in each variation. In BrE it is the educational content transferred from teacher to student at a university. In AmE it is the money (the fees) paid to receive that education (BrE: tuition fees).

=====General terms=====
In both the US and the UK, a student &quot;takes&quot; an exam, but in BrE a student can also be said to &quot;sit&quot; an exam. When preparing for an exam students &quot;revise&quot; (BrE)/&quot;review&quot; (AmE) what they have studied; the BrE idiom &quot;to revise for&quot; has the equivalent &quot;to review for&quot; in AmE. 

Examinations are supervised by &quot;invigilators&quot; in the UK and &quot;proctors&quot; (or &quot;(exam) supervisors&quot;) in the US (a &quot;proctor&quot; in the UK is an official responsible for student discipline at the University of Oxford or Cambridge). In the UK a teacher first &quot;sets&quot; and then &quot;administers&quot; exam, while in the US, a teacher first &quot;writes&quot;, &quot;makes&quot;, &quot;prepares&quot;, etc. and then &quot;gives&quot; an exam. With the same basic meaning of the latter idea but with a more formal or official connotation, a teacher in the US may also &quot;administer&quot; or &quot;proctor&quot; an exam. 

BrE: 

AmE: 

In BrE, students are awarded &quot;marks&quot; as credit for requirements (e.g., tests, projects) while in AmE, students are awarded &quot;points&quot; or &quot;grades&quot; for the same. Similarly, in BrE, a candidate&#x27;s work is being &quot;marked&quot;, while in AmE it is said to be &quot;graded&quot; to determine what mark or grade is given. 

There is additionally a difference between American and British usage in the word &quot;school&quot;. In British usage &quot;school&quot; by itself refers only to primary (elementary) and secondary (high) schools and to &quot;sixth forms&quot; attached to secondary schools—if one &quot;goes to school&quot;, this type of institution is implied. By contrast an American student at a university may be &quot;in/at school&quot;, &quot;coming/going to school&quot;, etc. US and British law students and medical students both commonly speak in terms of going to &quot;law school&quot; and &quot;med[ical] school&quot;, respectively. However, the word &quot;school&quot; is used in BrE in the context of higher education to describe a division grouping together several related subjects within a university, for example a &quot;School of European Languages&quot; containing &quot;departments&quot; for each language and also in the term &quot;art school&quot;. It is also the name of some of the constituent colleges of the University of London, for example, School of Oriental and African Studies, London School of Economics. 

Among high-school and college students in the United States, the words &quot;freshman&quot; (or the gender-neutral terms &quot;first year&quot; or sometimes &quot;freshie&quot;), &quot;sophomore&quot;, &quot;junior&quot; and &quot;senior&quot; refer to the first, second, third and fourth years respectively. It is important that the context of either high school or college first be established or else it must be stated directly (that is, &quot;She is a high-school freshman&quot;. &quot;He is a college junior.&quot;). Many institutes in both countries also use the term &quot;first-year&quot; as a gender-neutral replacement for &quot;freshman&quot;, although in the US this is recent usage, formerly referring only to those in the first year as a graduate student. One exception is the University of Virginia; since its founding in 1819 the terms &quot;first-year&quot;, &quot;second-year&quot;, &quot;third-year&quot;, and &quot;fourth-year&quot; have been used to describe undergraduate university students. At the United States service academies, at least those operated by the federal government directly, a different terminology is used, namely &quot;fourth class&quot;, &quot;third class&quot;, &quot;second class&quot; and &quot;first class&quot; (the order of numbering being the reverse of the number of years in attendance). In the UK first-year university students are sometimes called &quot;freshers&quot; early in the academic year; however, there are no specific names for those in other years nor for school pupils; “freshers’ week” or simply “freshers” is colloquially, but increasingly commonly, used to refer to the first few weeks of the academic year, typically when students get to know the university&#x27;s campus, join extra-curricular clubs and associations, and even going out for the night for drinking and to go to night clubs. Graduate and professional students in the United States are known by their year of study, such as a &quot;second-year medical student&quot; or a &quot;fifth-year doctoral candidate.&quot; Law students are often referred to as &quot;1L&quot;, &quot;2L&quot; or &quot;3L&quot; rather than “&quot;n&quot;th-year law students&quot;; similarly, medical students are frequently referred to as &quot;M1&quot;, &quot;M2&quot;, &quot;M3&quot; or &quot;M4&quot;. 

While anyone in the US who finishes studying at any educational institution by passing relevant examinations is said to &quot;graduate&quot; and to be a &quot;graduate&quot;, in the UK only degree and above level students can &quot;graduate&quot;. &quot;Student&quot; itself has a wider meaning in AmE, meaning any person of any age studying any subject at any level (including those not doing so at an educational institution, such as a &quot;piano student&quot; taking private lessons in a home), whereas in BrE it tends to be used for people studying at a post-secondary educational institution and the term &quot;pupil&quot; is more widely used for a young person at primary or secondary school, though the use of &quot;student&quot; for secondary school pupils in the UK is increasingly used, particularly for &quot;sixth form&quot; (years 12 and 13). 

The names of individual institutions can be confusing. There are several high schools with the word &quot;university&quot; in their names in the United States that are not affiliated with any post-secondary institutions and cannot grant degrees, and there is one public high school, Central High School of Philadelphia, that does grant bachelor&#x27;s degrees to the top 10% of graduating seniors. British secondary schools occasionally have the word &quot;college&quot; in their names. 

When it comes to the admissions process, applicants are usually asked to solicit &quot;letters of reference&quot; or reference forms from referees in BrE. In AmE, these are called &quot;letters of recommendation&quot; or recommendation forms. Consequently, the writers of these letters are known as &quot;referees&quot; and &quot;recommenders&quot;, respectively by country. In AmE, the word &quot;referee&quot; is nearly always understood to refer to an umpire of a sporting match. 

In the context of education, for AmE, the word &quot;staff&quot; mainly refers to school personnel who are neither administrators nor have teaching loads or academic responsibilities; personnel who have academic responsibilities are referred to as members of their institution&#x27;s &quot;faculty.&quot; In BrE, the word &quot;staff&quot; refers to both academic and non-academic school personnel. As mentioned previously, the term &quot;faculty&quot; in BrE refers more to a collection of related academic departments.

====Government and politics====
In the UK, political candidates &quot;stand for election&quot;, while in the US, they &quot;run for office&quot;. There is virtually no crossover between BrE and AmE in the use of these terms. Additionally, the document which contains a party&#x27;s positions/principles is referred to as a &quot;party platform&quot; in AmE, whereas it is commonly known as a &quot;party manifesto&quot; in BrE. (In AmE, using the term &quot;manifesto&quot; may connote that the party is an extremist or radical association). The term &quot;general election&quot; is used slightly differently in British and American English. In BrE, it refers exclusively to a nationwide parliamentary election and is differentiated from local elections (mayoral and council) and by-elections; whereas in AmE, it refers to a final election for any government position in the US, where the term is differentiated from the term &quot;primary&quot; (an election that determines a party&#x27;s candidate for the position in question). Additionally, a &quot;by-election&quot; in BrE is called a &quot;special election&quot; in AmE.

In AmE, the term &quot;swing state&quot;, &quot;swing county&quot;, &quot;swing district&quot; is used to denote a jurisdiction/constituency where results are expected to be close but crucial to the overall outcome of the general election. In BrE, the term &quot;marginal constituency&quot; is more often used for the same and &quot;swing&quot; is more commonly used to refer to how much one party has gained (or lost) an advantage over another compared to the previous election. 

In the UK, the term &quot;government&quot; only refers to what is commonly known in America as the &quot;executive branch&quot; or the particular &quot;administration&quot;.

A local government in the UK is generically referred to as the &quot;council,&quot; whereas in the United States, a local government will be generically referred to as the &quot;City&quot; (or county, village, etc., depending on what kind of entity the government serves).

====Business and finance====
In financial statements, what is referred to in AmE as &quot;revenue&quot; or &quot;sales&quot; is known in BrE as &quot;turnover.&quot; In AmE, having &quot;high turnover&quot; in a business context would generally carry negative implications, though the precise meaning would differ by industry. 

A bankrupt firm &quot;goes into administration&quot; or liquidation in BrE; in AmE it &quot;goes bankrupt&quot;, or &quot;files for Chapter 7&quot; (liquidation) or &quot;Chapter 11&quot; (reorganisation), both of which refer to the legal authority under which bankruptcy is commenced. An insolvent individual or partnership &quot;goes bankrupt&quot; in both BrE and AmE. 

If a finance company takes possession of a mortgaged property from a debtor, it is called &quot;foreclosure&quot; in AmE and &quot;repossession&quot; in BrE. In some limited scenarios, &quot;repossession&quot; may be used in AmE, but it is much less common compared to &quot;foreclosure&quot;. One common exception in AmE is for automobiles, which are always said to be &quot;repossessed&quot;. Indeed, an agent who collects these cars for the bank is colloquially known in AmE as a &quot;repo man&quot;.

====Employment and recruitment====
In BrE, the term &quot;curriculum vitae&quot; (commonly abbreviated to &quot;CV&quot;) is used to describe the document prepared by applicants containing their credentials required for a job. In AmE, the term &quot;résumé&quot; is more commonly used, with &quot;CV&quot; primarily used in academic or research contexts, and is usually more comprehensive than a &quot;résumé&quot;.

====Insurance====

AmE distinguishes between &quot;coverage&quot; as a noun and &quot;cover&quot; as a verb; an American seeks to buy enough insurance coverage in order to adequately cover a particular risk. BrE uses the word &quot;cover&quot; for both the noun and verb forms.

====Transport====
AmE speakers refer to &quot;transportation&quot; and BrE speakers to &quot;transport&quot;. (&quot;Transportation&quot; in the UK has traditionally meant the punishment of criminals by deporting them to an overseas penal colony.) In AmE, the word &quot;transport&quot; is usually used only as a verb, seldom as a noun or adjective except in reference to certain special objects, such as a &quot;tape transport&quot; or a &quot;military transport&quot; (e.g., a troop transport, a kind of vehicle, not an act of transporting).

=====Road transport=====
Differences in terminology are especially obvious in the context of roads. The British term &quot;dual carriageway&quot;, in American parlance, would be &quot;divided highway&quot; or perhaps, simply &quot;highway&quot;. The &quot;central reservation&quot; on a &quot;motorway&quot; or &quot;dual carriageway&quot; in the UK would be the &quot;median&quot; or &quot;center divide&quot; on a &quot;freeway&quot;, &quot;expressway&quot;, &quot;highway&quot; or &quot;parkway&quot; in the US. The one-way lanes that make it possible to enter and leave such roads at an intermediate point without disrupting the flow of traffic are known as &quot;slip roads&quot; in the UK but in the US, they are typically known as &quot;ramps&quot; and both further distinguish between &quot;on-ramps&quot; or &quot;on-slips&quot; (for entering onto a highway/carriageway) and &quot;off-ramps&quot; or &quot;exit-slips&quot; (for leaving a highway/carriageway). When American engineers speak of &quot;slip roads&quot;, they are referring to a street that runs alongside the main road (separated by a berm) to allow off-the-highway access to the premises that are there; however, the term &quot;frontage road&quot; is more commonly used, as this term is the equivalent of &quot;service road&quot; in the UK. However, it is not uncommon for an American to use &quot;service road&quot; as well instead of &quot;frontage road&quot;.

In the UK, the term &quot;outside lane&quot; refers to the higher-speed &quot;overtaking lane&quot; (&quot;passing lane&quot; in the US) closest to the middle of the road, while &quot;inside lane&quot; refers to the lane closer to the edge of the road. In the US, &quot;outside lane&quot; is used only in the context of a turn, in which case it depends in which direction the road is turning (i.e., if the road bends right, the left lane is the &quot;outside lane&quot;, but if the road bends left, it is the right lane). Both also refer to &quot;slow&quot; and &quot;fast&quot; lanes (even though all actual traffic speeds may be at or around the legal speed limit). 

In the UK &quot;drink driving&quot; refers to driving after having consumed alcoholic beverages, while in the US, the term is &quot;drunk driving&quot;. The legal term in the US is &quot;driving while intoxicated&quot; (DWI) or &quot;driving under the influence (of alcohol)&quot; (DUI). The equivalent legal phrase in the UK is &quot;drunk in charge of a motor vehicle&quot; (DIC) or more commonly &quot;driving with excess alcohol&quot;. 

In the UK, a hire car is the US equivalent of a rental car. The term &quot;hire car&quot; can be especially misleading for those in the US, where the term &quot;hire&quot; is generally only applied to the employment of people and the term &quot;rent&quot; is applied to the temporary custody of goods. To an American, &quot;hire car&quot; would imply that the car has been brought into the employment of a company as if it were a person, which would sound nonsensical. 

In the UK, a saloon is a vehicle that is equivalent to the American sedan. This is particularly confusing to Americans, because in the US the term &quot;saloon&quot; is used in only one context: describing an old bar (UK pub) in the American West (a Western saloon). &quot;Coupé&quot; is used by both to refer to a two-door car, but is usually pronounced with two syllables in the UK (coo-pay) and one syllable in the US (coop). 

In the UK, &quot;van&quot; may refer to a small lorry (UK), whereas in the US, &quot;van&quot; is only understood to be a very small, boxy truck (US) (such as a &quot;moving van&quot;) or a long passenger automobile with several rows of seats (such as a &quot;minivan&quot;). A large, long vehicle used for cargo transport would nearly always be called a &quot;truck&quot; in the US, though alternate terms such as &quot;eighteen-wheeler&quot; may be occasionally heard (regardless of the actual number of tires (UK tyres) on the truck). 

In the UK, a silencer is the equivalent to the US muffler. In the US, the word silencer has only one meaning: an attachment on the barrel of a gun designed to decrease the volume of the gunshot to either ear-safe levels or at least lower levels depending on the caliber; although they are popularly believed to completely hide the sound of the gunshot. 

Specific auto parts and transport terms have different names in the two dialects, for example:
=====Rail transport=====

There are also differences in terminology in the context of rail transport. The best known is &quot;railway&quot; in the UK and &quot;railroad&quot; in North America, but there are several others. A &quot;railway station&quot; in the UK is a &quot;railroad station&quot; in the US, while &quot;train station&quot; is used in both; trains have &quot;drivers&quot; (often called &quot;engine drivers&quot;) in the UK, while in America trains are driven by &quot;engineers&quot;; trains have &quot;guards&quot; in the UK and &quot;conductors&quot; in the US, though the latter is also common in the UK; a place where two tracks meet is called a set of &quot;points&quot; in the UK and a &quot;switch&quot; in the US; and a place where a road crosses a railway line at ground level is called a &quot;level crossing&quot; in the UK and a &quot;grade crossing&quot; or &quot;railroad crossing&quot; in America. In the UK, the term &quot;sleeper&quot; is used for the devices that bear the weight of the rails and are known as &quot;ties&quot; or &quot;crossties&quot; in the United States. In a rail context, &quot;sleeper&quot; (more often, &quot;sleeper car&quot;) would be understood in the US as a rail car with sleeping quarters for its passengers. The British term &quot;platform&quot; in the sense &quot;The train is at Platform 1&quot; would be known in the US by the term &quot;track&quot;, and used in the phrase &quot;The train is on Track 1&quot;. The American term for the British &quot;return journey&quot; is &quot;round trip&quot;. The British term &quot;brake van&quot; or &quot;guard&#x27;s van&quot; is a &quot;caboose&quot; in the US. The American English phrase &quot;All aboard&quot; when boarding a train is rarely used in the UK, and when the train reaches its final stop, in the UK the phrase used by rail personnel is &quot;All change&quot; while in the US it is &quot;All out&quot;, though such announcements are uncommon in both regions.

For sub-surface rail networks, while &quot;underground&quot; is commonly used in the UK, only the London Underground actually carries this name: the UK&#x27;s only other such system, the smaller Glasgow Subway, was in fact the first to be called &quot;subway&quot;. Nevertheless, both &quot;subway&quot; and &quot;metro&quot; are now more common in the US, varying by city: in Washington D.C., for example, &quot;metro&quot; is used, while in New York City &quot;subway&quot; is preferred. Another variation is the &quot;T&quot; in Boston.

====Television====

Traditionally, a &quot;show&quot; on British television would have referred to a light-entertainment programme (AmE &quot;program&quot;) with one or more performers and a participative audience, whereas in American television, the term is used for any type of program. British English traditionally referred to other types of programme by their type, such as drama, serial etc., but the term &quot;show&quot; has now taken on the general American meaning. In American television the episodes of a program first broadcast in a particular year constitute a &quot;season&quot;, the entire run of the program—which may span several seasons—is called a &quot;series&quot;. In British television, on the other hand, the word &quot;series&quot; may apply to the episodes of a programme in one particular year, for example, &quot;The 1998 series of &quot;Grange Hill&quot;, as well as to the entire run. However, the entire run may occasionally be referred to as a &quot;show&quot;.
The term &quot;telecast&quot;, meaning television broadcast and uncommon even in the US, is not used in British English. A television program(me) would be &quot;broadcast&quot;, &quot;aired&quot; or &quot;shown&quot; in both the UK and US.

====Telecommunications====

A long-distance call is a &quot;trunk call&quot; in British English, but is a &quot;toll call&quot; in American English, though neither term is well known among younger people. The distinction is a result of historical differences in the way local service was billed; the Bell System traditionally flat-rated local calls in all but a few markets, endowing local service by charging higher rates, or tolls, for intercity calls, allowing local calls to appear to be free. British Telecom (and the British &#x27;Post Office Telecommunications&#x27; before it) charged for all calls, local and long distance, so labelling one class of call as &quot;toll&quot; would have been meaningless. 

Similarly, a toll-free number in America is a freephone number in the UK. The term &quot;freefone&quot; is a BT trademark.

==== Rivers ====
In British English, the name of a river is usually placed after the word (River Thames) however there are a small number of exceptions such as Wick River. This matches the naming of lakes (e.g. Lake Superior, Loch Ness) and mountains (e.g. Mont Blanc, Mount St. Helens). In American English, the name is placed before the word (Hudson River).

==Grammar==
===Subject-verb agreement===
In American English (AmE), collective nouns are almost always singular in construction: &quot;the committee was unable to agree&quot;. However, when a speaker wishes to emphasize that the individuals are acting separately, a plural pronoun may be employed with a singular or plural verb: &quot;the team takes their seats&quot;, rather than &quot;the team takes its seats&quot;. Such a sentence would most likely be recast as &quot;the team members take their seats&quot;. Despite exceptions such as usage in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the names of sports teams are usually treated as plurals even if the form of the name is singular.

In British English (BrE), collective nouns can take either singular (&quot;formal agreement&quot;) or plural (&quot;notional agreement&quot;) verb forms, according to whether the emphasis is on the body as a whole or on the individual members respectively; compare &quot;a committee was appointed&quot; with &quot;the committee were unable to agree&quot;. The term &quot;the Government&quot; always takes a plural verb in British civil service convention, perhaps to emphasize the principle of cabinet collective responsibility. Compare also the following lines of Elvis Costello&#x27;s song &quot;Oliver&#x27;s Army&quot;: &quot;Oliver&#x27;s Army is here to stay / Oliver&#x27;s Army are on their way &quot;. Some of these nouns, for example &quot;staff&quot;, actually combine with plural verbs most of the time.

The difference occurs for all nouns of multitude, both general terms such as &quot;team&quot; and &quot;company&quot; and proper nouns (for example where a place name is used to refer to a sports team). For instance,

Proper nouns that are plural in form take a plural verb in both AmE and BrE; for example, &quot;The Beatles are a well-known band&quot;; &quot;The Diamondbacks are the champions&quot;, with one major exception: in American English, &quot;the United States&quot; is almost universally used with a singular verb. Although the construction &quot;the United States are&quot; was more common early in the history of the country, as the singular federal government exercised more authority and a singular national identity developed (especially following the American Civil War), it became standard to treat &quot;the United States&quot; as a singular noun.

==Style==
===Use of &quot;that&quot; and &quot;which&quot; in restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses===

Generally, a non-restrictive relative clause (also called non-defining or supplementary) is one containing information that is supplementary, i.e. does not change the meaning of the rest of the sentence, while a restrictive relative clause (also called defining or integrated) contains information essential to the meaning of the sentence, effectively limiting the modified noun phrase to a subset that is defined by the relative clause.

An example of a restrictive clause is &quot;The dog that bit the man was brown.&quot;

An example of a non-restrictive clause is &quot;The dog, which bit the man, was brown.&quot;

In the former, &quot;that bit the man&quot; identifies which dog the statement is about.

In the latter, &quot;which bit the man&quot; provides supplementary information about a known dog.

A non-restrictive relative clause is typically set off by commas, whereas a restrictive relative clause is not, but this is not a rule that is universally observed. In speech, this is also reflected in the intonation.

Writers commonly use &quot;which&quot; to introduce a non-restrictive clause, and &quot;that&quot; to introduce a restrictive clause. &quot;That&quot; is rarely used to introduce a non-restrictive relative clause in prose. &quot;Which&quot; and &quot;that&quot; are both commonly used to introduce a restrictive clause; a study in 1977 reported that about 75% of occurrences of &quot;which&quot; were in restrictive clauses.

H. W. Fowler, in &quot;A Dictionary of Modern English Usage&quot; of 1926, followed others in suggesting that it would be preferable to use &quot;which&quot; as the non-restrictive (what he calls &quot;non-defining&quot;) pronoun and &quot;that&quot; as the restrictive (what he calls defining) pronoun, but he also stated that this rule was observed neither by most writers nor by the best writers. He implied that his suggested usage was more common in American English. Fowler notes that his recommended usage presents problems, in particular that &quot;that&quot; must be the first word of the clause, which means, for instance, that &quot;which&quot; cannot be replaced by &quot;that&quot; when it immediately follows a preposition (e.g. &quot;the basic unit &quot;from which&quot; matter is constructed&quot;) – though this would not prevent a stranded preposition (e.g. &quot;the basic unit &quot;that&quot; matter is constructed &quot;from&quot;&quot;).

Style guides by American prescriptivists, such as Bryan Garner, typically insist, for stylistic reasons, that &quot;that&quot; be used for restrictive relative clauses and &quot;which&quot; be used for non-restrictive clauses, referring to the use of &quot;which&quot; in restrictive clauses as a &quot;mistake&quot;. According to the 2015 edition of &quot;Fowler&#x27;s Dictionary of Modern English Usage&quot;, &quot;In AmE &quot;which&quot; is &#x27;not generally used in restrictive clauses, and that fact is then interpreted as the absolute rule that only &quot;that&quot; may introduce a restrictive clause&#x27;, whereas in BrE &#x27;either &quot;that&quot; or &quot;which&quot; may be used in restrictive clauses&#x27;, but many British people &#x27;believe that &quot;that&quot; is obligatory.

===Subjunctive===

The subjunctive mood is more common in colloquial American English than in colloquial British English.

==Writing==

===Spelling===

Before the early 18th century there was no standard for English spelling. Different standards became noticeable after the publishing of influential dictionaries. For the most part current BrE spellings follow those of Samuel Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of the English Language&quot; (1755), while AmE spellings follow those of Noah Webster&#x27;s &quot;An American Dictionary of the English Language&quot; (1828). In the United Kingdom, the influences of those who preferred the French spellings of certain words proved decisive. In many cases AmE spelling deviated from mainstream British spelling; on the other hand it has also often retained older forms. Many of the now characteristic AmE spellings were made popular, although often not created, by Noah Webster. Webster chose already-existing alternative spellings &quot;on such grounds as simplicity, analogy or etymology&quot;. Webster did attempt to introduce some reformed spellings, as did the Simplified Spelling Board in the early 20th century, but most were not adopted. Later spelling changes in the UK had little effect on present-day US spelling, and vice versa.

===Punctuation===

====Full stops and periods in abbreviations====
There have been some trends of transatlantic difference in use of periods in some abbreviations. These are discussed at &quot;Abbreviation § Periods (full stops) and spaces&quot;. Unit symbols such as kg and Hz are never punctuated.

====Parentheses/brackets====
In British English, &quot;( )&quot; marks are often referred to as brackets, whereas &quot;[ ]&quot; are called square brackets and &quot;{ }&quot; are called curly brackets. In formal British English and in American English &quot;( )&quot; marks are parentheses (singular: parenthesis), &quot;[ ]&quot; are called brackets or square brackets, and &quot;{ }&quot; can be called either curly brackets or braces. Despite the different names, these marks are used in the same way in both varieties.

====Quoting====

British and American English differ in the preferred quotation mark style, including the placement of commas and periods. In American English, &quot; and &#x27; are called quotation marks, whereas in British English, &quot; and &#x27; are referred to as either inverted commas or speech marks. Additionally, in American English direct speech typically uses the double quote mark ( &quot; ), whereas in British English it is common to use the inverted comma ( &#x27; ).

====Commas in headlines====
American newspapers commonly use a comma as a shorthand for &quot;and&quot; in headlines. For example, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; had the headline &quot;A TRUE CONSERVATIVE: For McCain, Bush Has Both Praise, Advice.&quot;

==Numerical expressions==

There are many differences in the writing and speaking of English numerals, most of which are matters of style, with the notable exception of different definitions for billion.

The two countries have different conventions for floor numbering. The UK uses a mixture of the metric system and Imperial units, where in the US, United States customary units are dominant in everyday life with a few fields using the metric system.

===Monetary amounts===
Monetary amounts in the range of one to two major currency units are often spoken differently. In AmE one may say &quot;a dollar fifty&quot; or &quot;a pound eighty&quot;, whereas in BrE these amounts would be expressed &quot;one dollar fifty&quot; and &quot;one pound eighty&quot;. For amounts over a dollar an American will generally either drop denominations or give both dollars and cents, as in &quot;two-twenty&quot; or &quot;two dollars and twenty cents&quot; for $2.20. An American would not say &quot;two dollars twenty&quot;. On the other hand, in BrE, &quot;two-twenty&quot; or &quot;two pounds twenty&quot; would be most common.

It is more common to hear a British-English speaker say &quot;one thousand two hundred dollars&quot; than &quot;a thousand and two hundred dollars&quot;, although the latter construct is common in AmE. In British English, the &quot;and&quot; comes after the hundreds (&quot;one thousand, two hundred and thirty dollars&quot;). The term &quot;twelve hundred dollars&quot;, popular in AmE, is frequently used in BrE but only for exact multiples of 100 up to 1,900. Speakers of BrE very rarely hear amounts over 1,900 expressed in hundreds, for example, &quot;twenty-three hundred&quot;. In AmE it would not be unusual to refer to a high, uneven figure such as 2,307 as &quot;twenty-three hundred and seven&quot;.
In BrE, particularly in television or radio advertisements, integers can be pronounced individually in the expression of amounts. For example, &quot;on sale for £399&quot; might be expressed &quot;on sale for three nine nine&quot;, though the full &quot;three hundred and ninety-nine pounds&quot; is at least as common. An American advertiser would almost always say &quot;on sale for three ninety-nine&quot;, with context distinguishing $399 from $3.99. In British English the latter pronunciation implies a value in pounds and pence, so &quot;three ninety-nine&quot; would be understood as £3.99.
In spoken BrE the word &quot;pound&quot; is sometimes colloquially used for the plural as well. For example, &quot;three pound forty&quot; and &quot;twenty pound a week&quot; are both heard in British English. Some other currencies do not change in the plural; yen and rand being examples. This is in addition to normal adjectival use, as in &quot;a twenty-pound-a-week pay-rise&quot; (US &quot;raise&quot;). The euro most often takes a regular plural &quot;-s&quot; in practice despite the EU dictum that it should remain invariable in formal contexts; the invariable usage is more common in Ireland, where it is the official currency.
In BrE the use of &quot;p&quot; instead of &quot;pence&quot; is common in spoken usage. Each of the following has equal legitimacy: &quot;3 pounds 12 p&quot;; &quot;3 pounds and 12 p&quot;; &quot;3 pounds 12 pence&quot;; &quot;3 pounds and 12 pence&quot;; as well as just &quot;8 p&quot; or &quot;8 pence&quot;. In everyday usage the amount is simply read as figures (£3.50 = three pounds fifty) as in AmE.
AmE uses words such as &quot;nickel&quot;, &quot;dime&quot;, and &quot;quarter&quot; for small coins. In BrE the usual usage is &quot;a 10-pence piece&quot; or &quot;a 10p piece&quot; or simply &quot;a 10p&quot;, for any coin below £1, &quot;pound coin&quot; and &quot;two-pound coin&quot;. BrE did have specific words for a number of coins before decimalisation. Formal coin names such as &quot;half crown&quot; (2/6) and &quot;florin&quot; (2/-), as well as slang or familiar names such as &quot;bob&quot; (1/-) and &quot;tanner&quot; (6d) for pre-decimalisation coins are still familiar to older BrE speakers but they are not used for modern coins. In older terms like &quot;two-bob bit&quot; (2/-) and &quot;thrupenny bit&quot; (3d), the word &quot;bit&quot; had common usage before decimalisation similar to that of &quot;piece&quot; today.

In order to make explicit the amount in words on a check (BrE &quot;cheque&quot;), Americans write &quot;three and &quot; (using this solidus construction or with a horizontal division line): they do not need to write the word &quot;dollars&quot; as it is usually already printed on the check. On a cheque UK residents would write &quot;three pounds and 24 pence&quot;, &quot;three pounds ‒ 24&quot;, or &quot;three pounds ‒ 24p&quot; since the currency unit is not preprinted. To make unauthorised amendment difficult, it is useful to have an expression terminator even when a whole number of dollars/pounds is in use: thus, Americans would write &quot;three and &quot; or &quot;three and &quot; on a three-dollar check (so that it cannot easily be changed to, for example, &quot;three million&quot;), and UK residents would write &quot;three pounds only&quot;.

===Dates===

Dates are usually written differently in the short (numerical) form. Christmas Day 2000, for example, is 25/12/00 or 25.12.00 in the UK and 12/25/00 in the US, although the formats 25/12/2000, 25.12.2000, and 12/25/2000 are now more common then they were before Y2K. Occasionally other formats are encountered, such as the ISO 8601 2000-12-25, popular among programmers, scientists and others seeking to avoid ambiguity, and to make alphanumerical order coincide with chronological order. The difference in short-form date order can lead to misunderstanding, especially when using software or equipment that uses the foreign format. For example, 06/04/05 could mean either June 4, 2005 (if read as US format), 6 April 2005 (if seen as in UK format) or even 2006 April 5 if taken to be an older ISO 8601-style format where 2-digit years were allowed.
When using the name of the month rather than the number to write a date in the UK, the recent standard style is for the day to precede the month, e. g., 21 April. Month preceding date is almost invariably the style in the US, and was common in the UK until the late twentieth century. British usage normally changes the day from an integer to an ordinal, i.e., 21st instead of 21. In speech, &quot;of&quot; and &quot;the&quot; are used in the UK, as in &quot;the 21st of April&quot;. In written language, the words &quot;the&quot; and &quot;of&quot; may be and are usually dropped, i.e., 21 April. The US would say this as &quot;April 21st&quot;, and this form is still common in the UK. One of the few exceptions in American English is saying &quot;the Fourth of July&quot; as a shorthand for the United States Independence Day. In the US military the British forms are used, but the day is read cardinally, while among some speakers of New England and Southern American English varieties and who come from those regions but live elsewhere, those forms are common, even in formal contexts.
Phrases such as the following are common in the UK but are generally unknown in the US: &quot;A week today&quot;, &quot;a week tomorrow&quot;, &quot;a week (on) Tuesday&quot; and &quot;Tuesday week&quot;; these all refer to a day which is more than a week into the future. (&quot;A fortnight Friday&quot; and &quot;Friday fortnight&quot; refer to a day two weeks after the coming Friday). &quot;A week on Tuesday&quot; and &quot;a fortnight on Friday&quot; could refer either to a day in the past (&quot;it&#x27;s a week on Tuesday, you need to get another one&quot;) or in the future (&quot;see you a week on Tuesday&quot;), depending on context. In the US the standard construction is &quot;a week from today&quot;, &quot;a week from tomorrow&quot;, etc. BrE speakers may also say &quot;Thursday last&quot; or &quot;Thursday gone&quot; where AmE would prefer &quot;last Thursday&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;ll see you (on) Thursday coming&quot; or &quot;let&#x27;s meet this coming Thursday&quot; in BrE refer to a meeting later this week, while &quot;not until Thursday next&quot; would refer to next week. In BrE there is also common use of the term &#x27;Thursday after next&#x27; or &#x27;week after next&#x27; meaning 2 weeks in the future and &#x27;Thursday before last&#x27; and &#x27;week before last&#x27; meaning 2 weeks in the past, but not when referring to times more than 2 weeks been or gone or when using the terms tomorrow today or yesterday then in BrE you would say &#x27;5 weeks on Tuesday&#x27; or &#x27;2 weeks yesterday&#x27;.

===Time===

The 24-hour clock (&quot;18:00&quot;, &quot;18.00&quot; or &quot;1800&quot;) is considered normal in the UK and Europe in many applications including air, rail and bus timetables; it is largely unused in the US outside military, police, aviation and medical applications. As a result, many Americans refer to the 24-hour clock as &quot;military time&quot;. Some British English style guides recommend the full stop (.) when telling time, compared to American English which uses colons (:) (i.e., 11:15 PM/pm/p.m. or 23:15 for AmE and 11.15 pm or 23.15 for BrE). Usually in the military (and sometimes in the police, aviation and medical) applications on both sides of the Atlantic &quot;0800&quot; and &quot;1800&quot; are read as (&quot;oh/zero&quot;) &quot;eight hundred&quot; and &quot;eighteen hundred&quot; hours respectively. Even in the UK, &quot;hundred&quot; follows &quot;twenty&quot;, &quot;twenty-one&quot;, &quot;twenty-two&quot; and &quot;twenty-three&quot; when reading &quot;2000&quot;, &quot;2100&quot;, &quot;2200&quot; and &quot;2300&quot; according to those applications.
Fifteen minutes after the hour is called &quot;quarter past&quot; in British usage and &quot;a quarter after&quot; or, less commonly, &quot;a quarter past&quot; in American usage. Fifteen minutes before the hour is usually called &quot;quarter to&quot; in British usage and &quot;a quarter of&quot;, &quot;a quarter to&quot; or &quot;a quarter &#x27;til&quot; in American usage; the form &quot;a quarter to&quot; is associated with parts of the Northern United States, while &quot;a quarter &#x27;til&quot; or &quot;till&quot; is found chiefly in the Appalachian region. Thirty minutes after the hour is commonly called &quot;half past&quot; in both BrE and AmE; &quot;half after&quot; used to be more common in the US. In informal British speech, the preposition is sometimes omitted, so that 5:30 may be referred to as &quot;half five&quot;; this construction is entirely foreign to US speakers, who would possibly interpret &quot;half five&quot; as 4:30 (halfway to 5:00) rather than 5:30. The AmE formations &quot;top of the hour&quot; and &quot;bottom of the hour&quot; are not used in BrE. Forms such as &quot;eleven forty&quot; are common in both varieties. To be simple and direct in telling time, no terms relating to fifteen or thirty minutes before/after the hour are used; rather the time is told exactly as for example &quot;nine fifteen&quot;, &quot;ten forty-five&quot;.

===Sports percentages===
In sports statistics, certain percentages such as those for winning or win–loss records and saves in field or ice hockey and association football are almost always expressed as a decimal proportion to three places in AmE and are usually read aloud as if they are whole numbers, e.g. (0).500 or five hundred, hence the phrase &quot;games/matches over five hundred&quot;, whereas in BrE they are also expressed but as true percentages instead, after multiplying the decimal by 100%, that is, 50% or &quot;fifty per cent&quot; and &quot;games/matches over 50%&quot; or &quot;...50 per cent&quot;. However, &quot;games/matches over 50%&quot; or &quot;...50 percent&quot; is also found in AmE, albeit sporadically, e.g., hitting percentages in volleyball.

The American practice of expressing so-called percentages in sports statistics as decimals originated with baseball&#x27;s batting averages, developed by English-born statistician and historian Henry Chadwick.

<text>Atomic semantics is a type of guarantee provided by a data register shared by several processors in a parallel machine or in a network of computers working together.
Atomic semantics are very strong. An atomic register provides strong guarantees even when there is concurrency and failures.

A read/write register R stores a value and is accessed by two basic operations: read and write(v). A read returns the value stored in R and write(v) changes the value stored in R to v.
A register is called atomic if it satisfies the two following properties:

1) Each invocation op of a read or write operation:

•Must appear as if it were executed at a single point τ(op) in time.

•τ (op) works as follow:
τb(op) ≤ τ (op) ≤ τe(op): where τb(op) and τe(op) indicate the time when the operation op begins and ends.

•If op1 ≠ op2, then τ (op1)≠τ (op2)

2) Each read operation returns the value written by the last write operation before the read, in the sequence where all operations are ordered by their τ values.

Atomic/Linearizable register:

Termination: when a node is correct, sooner or later each read and write operation will complete.

Safety Property (Linearization points for read and write and failed operations):

Read operation:It appears as if happened at all nodes at some times between the invocation and response time.

Write operation: Similar to read operation, it appears as if happened at all nodes at some times between the invocation and response time.

Failed operation(The atomic term comes from this notion):It appears as if it is completed at every single node or it never happened at any node.

Example : We know that an atomic register is one that is linearizable to a sequential safe register.

The following picture shows where we should put the linearization point for each operation:

An atomic register could be defined for a variable with a single writer but multi- readers (SWMR), single-writer/single-reader (SWSR), or multi-writer/multi-reader (MWMR). Here is an example of a multi-reader multi-writer atomic register which is accessed by three processes (P1, P2, P3). Note that R. read() → v means that the corresponding read operation returns v, which is the value of the register. Therefore, the following execution of the register R could satisfies the definition of the atomic registers:
R.write(1), R.read()→1, R.write(3), R.write(2), R.read()→2, R.read()→2.

<doc id="2015" wikidata="Q55828" url="?curid=2015" title="Antarctic Circumpolar Current">
<text>Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is an ocean current that flows clockwise (as seen from the South Pole) from west to east around Antarctica. An alternative name for the ACC is the West Wind Drift. The ACC is the dominant circulation feature of the Southern Ocean and has a mean transport estimated at 100–150 Sverdrups (Sv, million m3/s), or possibly even higher, making it the largest ocean current. The current is circumpolar due to the lack of any landmass connecting with Antarctica and this keeps warm ocean waters away from Antarctica, enabling that continent to maintain its huge ice sheet. 

Associated with the Circumpolar Current is the Antarctic Convergence, where the cold Antarctic waters meet the warmer waters of the subantarctic, creating a zone of upwelling nutrients. These nurture high levels of phytoplankton with associated copepods and krill, and resultant food chains supporting fish, whales, seals, penguins, albatrosses, and a wealth of other species.

The ACC has been known to sailors for centuries; it greatly speeds up any travel from west to east, but makes sailing extremely difficult from east to west, although this is mostly due to the prevailing westerly winds. Jack London&#x27;s story &quot;Make Westing&quot; and the circumstances preceding the mutiny on the &quot;Bounty&quot; poignantly illustrate the difficulty it caused for mariners seeking to round Cape Horn westbound on the clipper ship route from New York to California. The eastbound clipper route, which is the fastest sailing route around the world, follows the ACC around three continental capes – Cape Agulhas (Africa), South East Cape (Australia), and Cape Horn (South America).

The current creates the Ross and Weddell Gyres.

== Structure ==

The ACC connects the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, and serves as a principal pathway of exchange among them. The current is strongly constrained by landform and bathymetric features. To trace it starting arbitrarily at South America, it flows through the Drake Passage between South America and the Antarctic Peninsula and then is split by the Scotia Arc to the east, with a shallow warm branch flowing to the north in the Falkland Current and a deeper branch passing through the Arc more to the east before also turning to the north. Passing through the Indian Ocean, the current first retroflects the Agulhas Current to form the Agulhas Return Current before it is split by the Kerguelen Plateau, and then moving northward again. Deflection is also seen as it passes over the mid-ocean ridge in the Southeast Pacific.

===Fronts===
The current is accompanied by three fronts: the Subantarctic front (SAF), the Polar front (PF), and the Southern ACC front (SACC). Furthermore, the waters of the Southern Ocean are separated from the warmer and saltier subtropical waters by the subtropical front (STF).

The northern boundary of the ACC is defined by the northern edge of the SAF, this being the most northerly water to pass through Drake Passage and therefore be circumpolar. Much of the ACC transport is carried in this front, which is defined as the latitude at which a subsurface salinity minimum or a thick layer of unstratified Subantarctic mode water first appears, allowed by temperature dominating density stratification. Still further south lies the PF, which is marked by a transition to very cold, relatively fresh, Antarctic Surface Water at the surface. Here a temperature minimum is allowed by salinity dominating density stratification, due to the lower temperatures. Farther south still is the SACC, which is determined as the southernmost extent of Circumpolar deep water (temperature of about 2 °C at 400 m). This water mass flows along the shelfbreak of the western Antarctic Peninsula and thus marks the most southerly water flowing through Drake Passage and therefore circumpolar. The bulk of the transport is carried in the middle two fronts.

The total transport of the ACC at Drake Passage is estimated to be around 135 Sv, or about 135 times the transport of all the world&#x27;s rivers combined. There is a relatively small addition of flow in the Indian Ocean, with the transport south of Tasmania reaching around 147 Sv, at which point the current is probably the largest on the planet.

==Dynamics==
The circumpolar current is driven by the strong westerly winds in the latitudes of the Southern Ocean.
In latitudes where there are continents, winds blowing on light surface water can simply pile up light water against these continents. But in the Southern Ocean, the momentum imparted to the surface waters cannot be offset in this way. There are different theories on how the Circumpolar Current balances the momentum imparted by the winds. The increasing eastward momentum imparted by the winds causes water parcels to drift outward from the axis of the Earth&#x27;s rotation (in other words, northward) as a result of the Coriolis force. This northward Ekman transport is balanced by a southward, pressure-driven flow below the depths of the major ridge systems. Some theories connect these flows directly, implying that there is significant upwelling of dense deep waters within the Southern Ocean, transformation of these waters into light surface waters, and a transformation of waters in the opposite direction to the north. Such theories link the magnitude of the Circumpolar Current with the global thermohaline circulation, particularly the properties of the North Atlantic.

Alternatively, ocean eddies, the oceanic equivalent of atmospheric storms, or the large-scale meanders of the Circumpolar Current may directly transport momentum downward in the water column. This is because such flows can produce a net southward flow in the troughs and a net northward flow over the ridges without requiring any transformation of density. In practice both the thermohaline and the eddy/meander mechanisms are likely to be important.

The current flows at a rate of about over the Macquarie Ridge south of New Zealand. The ACC varies with time. Evidence of this is the Antarctic Circumpolar Wave, a periodic oscillation that affects the climate of much of the southern hemisphere. There is also the Antarctic oscillation, which involves changes in the location and strength of Antarctic winds. Trends in the Antarctic Oscillation have been hypothesized to account for an increase in the transport of the Circumpolar Current over the past two decades.

== Formation ==
Published estimates of the onset of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current vary, but it is commonly considered to have started at the Eocene/Oligocene boundary. The isolation of Antarctica and formation of the ACC occurred with the openings of the Tasmanian Passage and the Drake Passage. The Tasmanian Seaway separates East Antarctica and Australia, and is reported to have opened to water circulation 33.5 million years ago (Ma). The timing of the opening of the Drake Passage, between South America and the Antarctic Peninsula, is more disputed. Tectonic and sediment evidence show that it could have been open as early as pre-34 Ma; estimates of the opening of the Drake passage are between 20 and 40 Ma. The isolation of Antarctica by the current is credited by many researchers with causing the glaciation of Antarctica and global cooling in the Eocene epoch. Oceanic models have shown that the opening of these two passages limited polar heat convergence and caused a cooling of sea surface temperatures by several degrees; other models have shown that CO2 levels also played a significant role in the glaciation of Antarctica.

== Phytoplankton ==

Antarctic sea ice cycles seasonally, in February–March the amount of sea ice is lowest, and in August–September the sea ice is at its greatest extent. Ice levels have been monitored by satellite since 1973. Upwelling of deep water under the sea ice brings substantial amounts of nutrients. As the ice melts, the melt water provides stability and the critical depth is well below the mixing depth, which allows for a positive net primary production. As the sea ice recedes epontic algae dominate the first phase of the bloom, and a strong bloom dominate by diatoms follows the ice melt south.

Another phytoplankton bloom occurs more to the north near the Antarctic Convergence, here nutrients are present from thermohaline circulation. Phytoplankton blooms are dominated by diatoms and grazed by copepods in the open ocean, and by krill closer to the continent. Diatom production continues through the summer, and populations of krill are sustained, bringing large numbers of cetaceans, cephalopods, seals, birds, and fish to the area.

Phytoplankton blooms are believed to be limited by irradiance in the austral (southern hemisphere) spring, and by biologically available iron in the summer. Much of the biology in the area occurs along the major fronts of the current, the Subtropical, Subantarctic, and the Antarctic Polar fronts, these are areas associated with well defined temperature changes. Size and distribution of phytoplankton are also related to fronts. Microphytoplankton (&gt;20 μm) are found at fronts and at sea ice boundaries, while nanophytoplankton (&lt;20 μm) are found between fronts.

Studies of phytoplankton stocks in the southern sea have shown that the Antarctic Circumpolar Current is dominated by diatoms, while the Weddell Sea has abundant coccolithophorids and silicoflagellates. Surveys of the SW Indian Ocean have shown phytoplankton group variation based on their location relative to the Polar Front, with diatoms dominating South of the front, and dinoflagellates and flagellates in higher populations North of the front.

Some research has been conducted on Antarctic phytoplankton as a carbon sink. Areas of open water left from ice melt are good areas for phytoplankton blooms. The phytoplankton takes carbon from the atmosphere during photosynthesis. As the blooms die and sink, the carbon can be stored in sediments for thousands of years. This natural carbon sink is estimated to remove 3.5 million tonnes from the ocean each year. 3.5 million tonnes of carbon taken from the ocean and atmosphere is equivalent to 12.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide.

== Studies ==
An expedition in May 2008 by 19 scientists studied the geology and biology of eight Macquarie Ridge sea mounts, as well as the Antarctic Circumpolar Current to investigate the effects of climate change of the Southern Ocean. The circumpolar current merges the waters of the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans and carries up to 150 times the volume of water flowing in all of the world&#x27;s rivers. The study found that any damage on the cold-water corals nourished by the current will have a long-lasting effect. After studying the circumpolar current it is clear that it strongly influences regional and global climate as well as underwater biodiversity. The subject has been characterized recently as &quot;the spectral peak of the global extra-tropical circulation at ≈ 10^4 kilometers&quot;.

The current helps preserve wooden shipwrecks by preventing wood-boring &quot;ship worms&quot; from reaching targets such as Ernest Shackleton&#x27;s ship, the &quot;Endurance&quot;.

The &quot;State of the cryosphere&quot; report found, that the Antarctic Circumpolar Current became weaker. By 2050 it expected to lose 20% of its strength with &quot;widespread impacts on ocean circulation and climate.&quot; The Weddell Sea Bottom Water has lost 30% of its volume in the latest 32 years, and the Antarctic Bottom Water is expected to shrink. This will impact ocean circulation, nutrients, heat content and carbon sequestration. UNESCO mentions that the report in the first time &quot;notes a growing scientific consensus that melting Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, among other factors, may be slowing important ocean currents at both poles, with potentially dire consequences for a much colder northern Europe and greater sea-level rise along the U.S. East Coast.&quot;
