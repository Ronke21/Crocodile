<text>Batman is a 1989 superhero film based on the DC Comics character of the same name, created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger. Directed by Tim Burton, it is the first installment of Warner Bros.&#x27; initial &quot;Batman&quot; film series. The film was produced by Jon Peters and Peter Guber and stars Jack Nicholson, Michael Keaton, Kim Basinger, Robert Wuhl, Pat Hingle, Billy Dee Williams, Michael Gough, and Jack Palance. The film takes place early in the war on crime of the title character (Keaton) and depicts his conflict with his archenemy the Joker (Nicholson).

After Burton was hired as director in 1986, Steve Englehart and Julie Hickson wrote film treatments before Sam Hamm wrote the first screenplay. &quot;Batman&quot; was not greenlit until after the success of Burton&#x27;s &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; (1988). The tone and themes of the film were partly influenced by Alan Moore and Brian Bolland&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and Frank Miller&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;. The film primarily adapts and then diverges from the &quot;Red Hood&quot; origin story for the Joker, having Batman inadvertently cause gangster Jack Napier to fall into Axis Chemical acid, triggering his transformation into the psychotic Joker. Additionally, Batman co-creator Bob Kane worked as a consultant for the film.

Numerous leading men were considered for the role of Batman before Keaton was cast. Keaton&#x27;s casting was controversial since, by 1988, he had become typecast as a comedic actor and many observers doubted he could portray a serious role. Nicholson accepted the role of the Joker under strict conditions that dictated top billing, a portion of the film&#x27;s earnings (including associated merchandise), and his own shooting schedule. Filming took place at Pinewood Studios from October 1988 to January 1989. The budget escalated from $30 million to $48 million, while the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike forced Hamm to drop out. Warren Skaaren did rewrites, with additional uncredited drafts done by Charles McKeown and Jonathan Gems.

&quot;Batman&quot; was both critically and financially successful, earning over $400 million in box office totals. Critics and audiences particularly praised Nicholson and Keaton&#x27;s performances, Burton&#x27;s direction, the production design, and Elfman&#x27;s score. It was the sixth-highest-grossing film in history at the time of its release. The film received several Saturn Award nominations and a Golden Globe nomination for Nicholson&#x27;s performance, and won the Academy Award for Best Art Direction.

The film was followed by three sequels: &quot;Batman Returns&quot; (1992), with both Burton and Keaton returning; &quot;Batman Forever&quot; (1995), which featured Val Kilmer in the lead role; and &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; (1997), which featured George Clooney in the role. Keaton eventually reprised the role of Batman in the DC Extended Universe film &quot;The Flash&quot; (2023). The film also led to the development of &quot;&quot; (1992–1995), which in turn began the DC Animated Universe of spin-off media, and has influenced Hollywood&#x27;s modern marketing and development techniques of the superhero film genre.

==Plot==

Reporter Alexander Knox and photojournalist Vicki Vale investigate sightings of &quot;Batman&quot;, a masked vigilante targeting Gotham City&#x27;s criminals. Both attend a fundraiser hosted by billionaire Bruce Wayne, who is secretly Batman, having chosen this path after witnessing a mugger murder his parents when he was a child. During the event, Wayne becomes infatuated with Vale.

Meanwhile, mob boss Carl Grissom sends his sociopathic second-in-command Jack Napier to raid Axis Chemicals and retrieve incriminating evidence. However, this is secretly a ploy to have Napier murdered for sleeping with Grissom&#x27;s mistress Alicia Hunt. Corrupt lieutenant Max Eckhardt arranges the hit on Napier by conducting an unauthorized police operation. However, Commissioner James Gordon arrives, takes command, and orders the officers to capture Napier alive. Batman also appears, while Napier kills Eckhardt as revenge for the double-crossing. During a scuffle with Batman, Napier topples off a catwalk and falls into a vat of chemicals. Although presumed dead, Napier survives with various disfigurements including chalk white skin and emerald-green hair and nails. He undergoes surgery to repair the damage, but ends up with a rictus grin. Driven insane by his new appearance, Napier, now calling himself &quot;the Joker&quot;, kills Grissom, massacres Grissom&#x27;s associates, and takes over his operations.

He then starts terrorizing Gotham by lacing hygiene products with &quot;Smylex&quot; – a deadly chemical that causes victims to die laughing. Joker soon becomes obsessed with Vicki and lures her to the Flugelheim Museum, which his henchmen start vandalizing. Batman rescues Vicki, takes her to the Batcave, and provides her with all of his research on Smylex, which will allow Gotham&#x27;s residents to escape the toxin. Conflicted with his love for her, Wayne visits her apartment intending to reveal his secret identity, only for the Joker to interrupt the meeting. Joker asks Wayne, &quot;Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?&quot;, which Wayne recognizes as the catchphrase used by the mugger who killed his parents, realizing the killer to have been Joker (as Napier) all along. He shoots Wayne, who survives thanks to a serving tray hidden underneath his shirt.

Vicki is taken to the Batcave by Wayne&#x27;s butler, Alfred Pennyworth, who had been coaxing the relationship between the pair. After Vicki learns his secret, Wayne chooses to battle the Joker for the sake of the city over their relationship. He then departs to destroy the Axis plant used to create Smylex. Meanwhile, Joker lures Gotham&#x27;s citizens to a parade honoring Gotham&#x27;s bicentennial with the promise of free money. This turns out to be a trap designed to dose them with Smylex gas held within giant parade balloons. Batman foils his plan by using his Batwing to remove the balloons, but Joker shoots him down. The Batwing crashes in front of a cathedral, which Joker uses to take Vicki hostage. Batman pursues the Joker, and in the ensuing fight, he explains that Napier killed his parents and thus, indirectly created Batman. This leads Joker to realize Batman is Bruce Wayne. Joker eventually pulls Batman and Vicki over the cathedral&#x27;s roof, leaving them hanging while he calls in a helicopter. The helicopter is piloted by his goons, who throw down a ladder for him to climb. Batman uses a grappling hook to attach Joker&#x27;s leg to a crumbling gargoyle that eventually falls off the roof. Unable to bear the statue&#x27;s immense weight, Joker falls to his death while Batman and Vicki make it to safety.

Sometime later, Gordon announces that the police have arrested all of Joker&#x27;s men, effectively dismantled what remained of Carl Grissom&#x27;s mafia organizations, and unveils the Bat-Signal. Batman leaves the police a note, promising to defend Gotham should crime strike again, and asking them to use the Bat-Signal to summon him in times of need. Alfred takes Vicki to Wayne Manor, explaining that Wayne will be a little late. She responds that she is not surprised, as Batman looks at the signal&#x27;s projection from a rooftop, standing watch over the city.

===Development===
In the late 1970s, Batman&#x27;s popularity was waning. CBS was interested in producing a &quot;Batman in Outer Space&quot; film. Producers Benjamin Melniker and Michael E. Uslan purchased the film rights of Batman from DC Comics on October 3, 1979. It was Uslan&#x27;s wish &quot;to make the definitive, dark, serious version of Batman, the way Bob Kane and Bill Finger had envisioned him in 1939. A creature of the night; stalking criminals in the shadows.&quot; Richard Maibaum was approached to write a script with Guy Hamilton to direct, but the two turned down the offer. Uslan was unsuccessful with pitching &quot;Batman&quot; to various movie studios because they wanted the film to be similar to the campy 1960s television series. Columbia Pictures and United Artists were among those to turn down the film.

A disappointed Uslan then wrote a script titled &quot;Return of the Batman&quot; to give the film industry a better idea of his vision for the film. Uslan later compared its dark tone to that of the successful four-part comic book &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;, which his script predated by six years. In November 1979, producers Jon Peters and Peter Guber joined the project. Melniker and Uslan became executive producers. The four felt it was best to pattern the film&#x27;s development after that of &quot;Superman&quot; (1978). Uslan, Melniker and Guber pitched &quot;Batman&quot; to Universal Pictures, but the studio turned it down. Though no movie studios were yet involved, the project was publicly announced with a budget of $15 million in July 1980 at the Comic Art Convention in New York. Warner Bros., the studio behind the successful Superman film franchise, decided to also accept and produce &quot;Batman&quot;.

Tom Mankiewicz completed a script titled &quot;The Batman&quot; in June 1983, focusing on Batman and Dick Grayson&#x27;s origins, with the Joker and Rupert Thorne as villains and Silver St. Cloud as the romantic interest. Mankiewicz took inspiration from the limited series &quot;Batman: Strange Apparitions&quot;, written by Steve Englehart. Comic book artist Marshall Rogers, who worked with Englehart on &quot;Strange Apparitions&quot;, was hired for concept art. &quot;The Batman&quot; was then announced in late 1983 for a mid-1985 release date on a budget of $20 million. Originally, Mankiewicz had wanted an unknown actor for Batman, William Holden for James Gordon, David Niven as Alfred Pennyworth, and Peter O&#x27;Toole as the Penguin, whom Mankiewicz wanted to portray as a mobster with low body temperature. Holden died in 1981 and Niven in 1983, so this would never come to pass. A number of filmmakers were attached to Mankiewicz&#x27; script, including Ivan Reitman and Joe Dante. Reitman wanted to cast Bill Murray as Batman and Eddie Murphy as Robin. Nine rewrites were performed by nine separate writers. Most of them were based on &quot;Strange Apparitions&quot;. However, it was Mankiewicz&#x27;s script that was still being used to guide the project. Due to the work they did together with the film &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; (1982), Wes Craven was among the directors that Melniker and Uslan considered while looking for a director.

After the financial success of &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot; (1985), Warner Bros. hired Tim Burton to direct &quot;Batman&quot;. Burton had then-girlfriend Julie Hickson write a new 30-page film treatment, feeling the previous script by Mankiewicz was campy. The success of &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; and the graphic novel &quot;&quot; rekindled Warner Bros.&#x27; interest in a film adaptation. Burton was initially not a comic book fan, but he was impressed by the dark and serious tone found in both &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; and &quot;The Killing Joke&quot;. Warner Bros. enlisted the aid of Englehart to write a new treatment in March 1986. Like Mankiewicz&#x27;s script, it was based on his own &quot;Strange Apparitions&quot; and included Silver St. Cloud, Dick Grayson, the Joker, and Rupert Thorne, as well as a cameo appearance by the Penguin. Warner Bros. was impressed, but Englehart felt there were too many characters. He removed the Penguin and Dick Grayson in his second treatment, finishing in May 1986.

Burton approached Sam Hamm, a comic book fan, to write the screenplay. Hamm decided not to use an origin story, feeling that flashbacks would be more suitable and that &quot;unlocking the mystery&quot; would become part of the storyline. He reasoned, &quot;You totally destroy your credibility if you show the literal process by which Bruce Wayne becomes Batman.&quot; Hamm replaced Silver St. Cloud with Vicki Vale and Rupert Thorne with his own creation, Carl Grissom. He completed his script in October 1986, which demoted Dick Grayson to a cameo rather than a supporting character. One scene in Hamm&#x27;s script had a young James Gordon on duty the night of the murder of Bruce Wayne&#x27;s parents. When Hamm&#x27;s script was rewritten, the scene was deleted, reducing it to a photo in the &quot;Gotham Globe&quot; newspaper seen in the film.

Warner Bros. was less willing to move forward on development, despite their enthusiasm for Hamm&#x27;s script, which Kane greeted with positive feedback. Hamm&#x27;s script was then bootlegged at various comic book stores in the United States. &quot;Batman&quot; was finally given the greenlight to commence pre-production in April 1988, after the success of Burton&#x27;s &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; the same year. When comic book fans found out about Burton directing the film with Michael Keaton starring in the lead role, controversy arose over the tone and direction &quot;Batman&quot; was going in. Hamm explained, &quot;They hear Tim Burton&#x27;s name and they think of &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot;. They hear Keaton&#x27;s name, and they think of any number of Michael Keaton comedies. You think of the 1960s version of &quot;Batman&quot;, and it was the complete opposite of our film. We tried to market it with a typical dark and serious tone, but the fans didn&#x27;t believe us.&quot; To combat negative reports on the film&#x27;s production, Kane was hired as creative consultant. Batman&#x27;s co-creator, Bill Finger, was uncredited at the time of the film&#x27;s release and his name was not added to any Batman-related media until 2016.

===Casting===

Parallel to the &quot;Superman&quot; casting, a variety of Hollywood A-listers were considered for the role of Batman, including Mel Gibson, Kevin Costner, Charlie Sheen, Tom Selleck, Bill Murray, Harrison Ford and Dennis Quaid. Burton was pressured by Warner Bros. to cast an obvious action movie star, and had approached Pierce Brosnan, but he had no interest in playing a comic book character. Burton was originally interested in casting an unknown actor, Willem Dafoe, who was falsely reported to be considered for the Joker but had actually been considered for Batman early in development. Producer Jon Peters suggested Michael Keaton, arguing he had the right &quot;edgy, tormented quality&quot; after having seen his dramatic performance in &quot;Clean and Sober&quot;. Having directed Keaton in &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;, Burton agreed.

The casting of Keaton caused a furor among comic book fans, with 50,000 protest letters sent to Warner Bros. offices. Kane, Hamm, and Uslan also heavily questioned the casting. &quot;Obviously there was a negative response from the comic book people. I think they thought we were going to make it like the 1960s TV series, and make it campy, because they thought of Michael Keaton from &quot;Mr. Mom&quot; and &quot;Night Shift&quot; and stuff like that.&quot; Keaton studied &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; for inspiration.

Tim Curry, David Bowie, John Lithgow, Brad Dourif, Ray Liotta, and James Woods were all considered for the Joker. Lithgow, during his audition, attempted to talk Burton out of casting him, a decision he would later publicly regret, stating, &quot;I didn&#x27;t realize it was such a big deal.&quot; Burton wanted to cast John Glover, but the studio insisted on using a movie star. Robin Williams lobbied hard for the part. Jack Nicholson had been the studio&#x27;s top choice since 1980. Peters approached Nicholson as far back as 1986, during filming of &quot;The Witches of Eastwick&quot;; unlike Keaton, he was a popular choice for his role. Nicholson had what was known as an &quot;off-the-clock&quot; agreement. His contract specified the number of hours he was entitled to have off each day, from the time he left the set to the time he reported back for filming, as well as being off for Los Angeles Lakers home games. Nicholson demanded that all of his scenes be shot in a three-week block, but the schedule lapsed into 106 days. He reduced his standard $10 million fee to $6 million in exchange for a cut of the film&#x27;s earnings (including associated merchandise), which led to remuneration in excess of $50 million—biographer Marc Eliot reports that Nicholson may have received as much as $90 million. He also demanded top billing on promotional materials.

Sean Young was originally cast as Vicki Vale, but was injured in a horse-riding accident prior to commencement of filming. Young&#x27;s departure necessitated an urgent search for an actress who, besides being right for the part, could commit to the film at very short notice. Peters suggested Kim Basinger: she was able to join the production immediately and was cast. As a fan of Michael Gough&#x27;s work in various Hammer Film Productions, Burton cast Gough as Bruce Wayne&#x27;s mysterious butler, Alfred. Reporter Alexander Knox was portrayed by Robert Wuhl. In the original script, Knox was killed by the Joker&#x27;s poison gas during the climax, but the filmmakers &quot;liked [my] character so much,&quot; Wuhl said, &quot;that they decided to let me live.&quot; Burton chose Billy Dee Williams as Harvey Dent because he wanted to include the villain Two-Face in a future film using the concept of an African-American Two-Face for the black and white concept, but Tommy Lee Jones was later cast in the role for &quot;Batman Forever&quot;, which disappointed Williams. Fortunately, Williams would go on to voice Two-Face in &quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot; in 2017. Nicholson convinced the filmmakers to cast his close friend Tracey Walter as the Joker&#x27;s henchman Bob. Irish child actor Ricky Addison Reed was cast as Dick Grayson before the character was removed by Warren Skarren for the revised shooting script. The rest of the cast included Pat Hingle as Commissioner Gordon, Jerry Hall as Alicia, Lee Wallace as Mayor Borg, William Hootkins as Lt. Eckhardt, and Jack Palance as crime boss Carl Grissom.

===Design===

Burton had been impressed with the design of Neil Jordan&#x27;s &quot;The Company of Wolves&quot; (1984), but was unable to hire its production designer Anton Furst for &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; as he had instead committed to Jordan&#x27;s London-filmed ghost comedy &quot;High Spirits&quot; (1988), a choice he later regretted. A year later Burton successfully hired Furst for &quot;Batman&quot;, and they enjoyed working with each other. &quot;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever felt so naturally in tune with a director,&quot; Furst said. &quot;Conceptually, spiritually, visually, or artistically. There was never any problem because we never fought over anything. Texture, attitude and feelings are what Burton is a master at.&quot;

Furst and the art department deliberately mixed clashing architectural styles to &quot;make Gotham City the ugliest and bleakest metropolis imaginable&quot;. Furst continued, &quot;[W]e imagined what New York City might have become without a planning commission. A city run by crime, with a riot of architectural styles. An essay in ugliness. As if hell erupted through the pavement and kept on going&quot;. The 1985 film &quot;Brazil&quot; by Terry Gilliam was also a notable influence upon the film&#x27;s production design, as both Burton and Furst studied it as a reference. Black and white charcoal drawings of key locations and sets were created by Furst&#x27;s longtime draftsman, Nigel Phelps. Derek Meddings served as the visual effects supervisor, overseeing the miniatures and animation. Conceptual illustrator Julian Caldow designed the Batmobile, Batwing and assorted bat-gadgets that were later constructed by prop builder John Evans. Keith Short sculpted the final body of the 1989 Batmobile, adding two Browning machine guns. On designing the Batmobile, Furst explained, &quot;We looked at jet aircraft components, we looked at war machines, we looked at all sorts of things. In the end, we went into pure expressionism, taking the Salt Flat Racers of the 30s and the Sting Ray macho machines of the 50s&quot;. The car was built upon a Chevrolet Impala when previous development with a Jaguar and Ford Mustang failed. The car itself was later purchased by standup comedian/ventriloquist Jeff Dunham, who had it outfitted with a Corvette engine to make it street legal.

Costume designer Bob Ringwood turned down the chance to work on &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; in favor of &quot;Batman&quot;. Ringwood found it difficult designing the Batsuit because &quot;the image of Batman in the comics is this huge, big six-foot-four hunk with a dimpled chin. Michael Keaton is a guy with average build&quot;, he stated. &quot;The problem was to make somebody who was average-sized and ordinary-looking into this bigger-than-life creature.&quot; Burton commented, &quot;Michael is a bit claustrophobic, which made it worse for him. The costume put him in a dark, Batman-like mood though, so he was able to use it to his advantage&quot;. Burton&#x27;s idea was to use an all-black suit, and was met with positive feedback by Bob Kane. Vin Burnham was tasked with sculpting the Batsuit, in association with Alli Eynon. Jon Peters wanted to use a Nike product placement with the Batsuit. Ringwood studied over 200 comic book issues for inspiration. 28 sculpted latex designs were created; 25 different cape looks and 6 different heads were made, accumulating a total cost of $250,000. Comic book fans initially expressed negative feedback against the Batsuit. Burton opted not to use tights, spandex, or underpants as seen in the comic book, feeling it was not intimidating. Prosthetic makeup designer Nick Dudman used acrylic-based makeup paint called PAX for Nicholson&#x27;s chalk-white face. Part of Nicholson&#x27;s contract was approval over the makeup designer.

===Filming===
The filmmakers considered filming &quot;Batman&quot; entirely on the Warner Bros. backlot in Burbank, California, but media interest in the film made them change the location. It was shot at Pinewood Studios in England from October 10, 1988, to February 14, 1989, with 80 days of main shooting and 86 days of second unit shooting. 18 sound stages were used, with seven stages occupied, including the 51 acre backlot for the Gotham City set, one of the biggest ever built at the studio. Locations included Knebworth House and Hatfield House doubling for Wayne Manor, plus Acton Lane Power Station and Little Barford Power Station. The original production budget escalated from $30 million to $48 million. Filming was highly secretive. The unit publicist was offered and refused £10,000 for the first pictures of Jack Nicholson as the Joker. The police were later called in when two reels of footage (about 20 minutes&#x27; worth) were stolen. With various problems during filming, Burton called it &quot;Torture. The worst period of my life!&quot;

Hamm was not allowed to perform rewrites during the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike. Warren Skaaren, who had also worked on Burton&#x27;s &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;, did rewrites. Jonathan Gems and Charles McKeown rewrote the script during filming. Only Skaaren received screenplay credit with Hamm. Hamm criticized the rewrites, but blamed the changes on Warner Bros. Burton explained, &quot;I don&#x27;t understand why that became such a problem. We started out with a script that everyone liked, although we recognized it needed a little work.&quot; Dick Grayson appeared in the shooting script but was deleted because the filmmakers felt he was irrelevant to the plot; Kane supported this decision.

Keaton used his comedic experience for scenes such as Bruce and Vicki&#x27;s Wayne Manor dinner. He called himself a &quot;logic freak&quot; and was concerned that Batman&#x27;s secret identity would in reality be fairly easy to uncover. Keaton discussed ideas with Burton to better disguise the character, including the use of contact lenses. Ultimately, Keaton decided to perform Batman&#x27;s voice at a lower register than when he was portraying Bruce Wayne, which became a hallmark of the film version of the character, with Christian Bale later using the same technique.

Originally in the climax, the Joker was meant to kill Vicki Vale, sending Batman into a vengeful fury. Jon Peters reworked the climax without telling Burton and commissioned production designer Anton Furst to create a model of the cathedral. This cost $100,000 when the film was already well over budget. Burton disliked the idea, having no clue how the scene would end: &quot;Here were Jack Nicholson and Kim Basinger walking up this cathedral, and halfway up Jack turns around and says, &#x27;Why am I walking up all these stairs? Where am I going?&#x27; &#x27;We&#x27;ll talk about it when you get to the top!&#x27; I had to tell him that I didn&#x27;t know.&quot;

===Music===

Burton hired Danny Elfman of Oingo Boingo, his collaborator on &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot; and &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;, to compose the music score. For inspiration, Elfman was given &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;. Elfman was worried, as he had never worked on a production this large in budget and scale. In addition, producer Jon Peters was skeptical of hiring Elfman, but was later convinced when he heard the opening number. Peters and Peter Guber wanted Prince to write music for the Joker and Michael Jackson to do the romance songs. Elfman would then combine the style of Prince and Jackson&#x27;s songs together for the entire film score. At the encouragement of Prince&#x27;s then-manager Albert Magnoli, it was agreed that Prince himself would write and sing the film&#x27;s songs.

Burton protested the ideas, citing &quot;my movies aren&#x27;t commercial like &quot;Top Gun&quot;.&quot; Elfman enlisted the help of composer Shirley Walker and Oingo Boingo lead guitarist Steve Bartek to arrange the compositions for the orchestra. Elfman was later displeased with the audio mixing of his film score. &quot;&quot;Batman&quot; was done in England by technicians who didn&#x27;t care, and the non-caring showed,&quot; he stated. &quot;I&#x27;m not putting down England because they&#x27;ve done gorgeous dubs there, but this particular crew elected not to.&quot; &quot;Batman&quot; was one of the first films to spawn two soundtracks. One of them featured songs written by Prince while the other showcased Elfman&#x27;s score. Both were successful, and compilations of Elfman&#x27;s opening credits were used in the title sequence theme for &quot;&quot;, also composed by Shirley Walker.

==Themes==
When discussing the central theme of &quot;Batman&quot;, director Tim Burton explained, &quot;the whole film and mythology of the character is a complete duel of the freaks. It&#x27;s a fight between two disturbed people&quot;, adding, &quot;The Joker is such a great character because there&#x27;s a complete freedom to him. Any character who operates on the outside of society and is deemed a freak and an outcast then has the freedom to do what they want... They are the darker sides of freedom. Insanity is in some scary way the most freedom you can have, because you&#x27;re not bound by the laws of society&quot;.

Burton saw Bruce Wayne as the bearer of a double identity, exposing one while hiding the reality from the world. Burton biographer Ken Hanke wrote that Bruce Wayne, struggling with his alter-ego as Batman, is depicted as an antihero. Hanke felt that Batman has to push the boundaries of civil justice to deal with certain criminals, such as the Joker. Kim Newman theorized that &quot;Burton and the writers saw Batman and the Joker as a dramatic antithesis, and the film deals with their intertwined origins and fates to an even greater extent&quot;.

&quot;Batman&quot; conveys trademarks found in 1930s pulp magazines, notably the design of Gotham City stylized with Art Deco design. Richard Corliss, writing for &quot;Time&quot;, observed that Gotham&#x27;s design was a reference to films such as &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot; (1920) and &quot;Metropolis&quot; (1927). &quot;Gotham City, despite being shot on a studio backlot&quot;, he continued, &quot;is literally another character in the script. It has the demeaning presence of German Expressionism and fascist architecture, staring down at the citizens.&quot; Hanke further addressed the notions of &quot;Batman&quot; being a period piece, in that &quot;The citizens, cops, people and the black-and-white television looks like it takes place in 1939&quot;; but later said: &quot;Had the filmmakers made Vicki Vale a femme fatale rather than a damsel in distress, this could have made &quot;Batman&quot; as a homage and tribute to classic film noir.&quot; Portions of the climax pay homage to &quot;Vertigo&quot; (1958).

==Marketing==
The B.D. Fox ad agency created hundreds of unused logos and posters for promotion, many by John Alvin. In the end Burton and producers decided on only using a gold and black logo designed by Anton Furst and airbrushed by Bill Garland, with no other key art variation, to keep an air of mystery about the film. The logo is also an ambiguous image, which can be read either as Batman&#x27;s symbol or as a gaping mouth. Earlier designs &quot;had the word &#x27;Batman&#x27; spelled in &quot;RoboCop&quot; or &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot;-type font&quot;. Jon Peters unified all the film&#x27;s tie-ins, even turning down $6 million from General Motors to build the Batmobile because the car company would not relinquish creative control.

During production, Peters read in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; that comic book fans were unsatisfied with the casting of Michael Keaton. In response, Peters rushed the first film trailer that played in thousands of theaters during Christmas. It was simply an assemblage of scenes without music, but created enormous anticipation for the film, with audiences clapping and cheering. DC Comics allowed screenwriter Sam Hamm to write his own comic book miniseries. Hamm&#x27;s stories were collected in the graphic novel &quot;Batman: Blind Justice&quot; (). Denys Cowan and Dick Giordano illustrated the artwork. &quot;Blind Justice&quot; tells the story of Bruce Wayne trying to solve a series of murders connected to Wayne Enterprises. It also marks the first appearance of Henri Ducard, who was later used in the rebooted &quot;Batman Begins&quot;, albeit as an alias for the more notable Ra&#x27;s al Ghul.

In the months before &quot;Batman&quot;″s release in June 1989, a popular culture phenomenon known as &quot;Batmania&quot; began. Over $750 million worth of merchandise was sold. Cult filmmaker and comic book writer Kevin Smith remembered: &quot;That summer was huge. You couldn&#x27;t turn around without seeing the Bat-Signal somewhere. People were cutting it into their fucking heads. It was just the summer of Batman and if you were a comic book fan it was pretty hot.&quot; Hachette Book Group USA published a novelization, &quot;Batman&quot;, written by Craig Shaw Gardner. It remained on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list throughout June 1989. Burton admitted he was annoyed by the publicity. David Handelman of &quot;The New York Observer&quot; categorized &quot;Batman&quot; as a high concept film. He believed &quot;it is less movie than a corporate behemoth&quot;.

==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;Batman&quot; grossed $2.2 million in late night previews on June 22, 1989, on 1,215 screens and grossed $40.49 million in 2,194 theaters during its opening weekend. This broke the opening weekend records held by &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; (which had a 4-day Memorial Day weekend gross of $37.0 million the previous month) and &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot; (which had a $29.4 million 3-day weekend the previous weekend). Upon opening, the film would go on to reach the number one spot above &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&quot;. Additionally, it had the largest opening weekend for a Jack Nicholson film for 14 years until it was dethroned by &quot;Anger Management&quot; in 2003. &quot;Batman&quot; also set a record for a second weekend gross with $30 million (also the second biggest 3-day weekend of all time) and became the fastest film to earn $100 million, reaching it in 11 days (10 days plus late night previews). The film closed on December 14, 1989, with a final gross of $251.4 million in North America and $160.2 million internationally, totaling $411.6 million. The film would hold the record for being the highest-grossing Warner Bros. film until 1996 when &quot;Twister&quot; surpassed it. It was the highest-grossing film based on a DC comic book until 2008&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;. Furthermore, &quot;Batman&quot; held the record for being the highest-grossing superhero film of all time until it was taken by &quot;Spider-Man&quot; in 2002. The film&#x27;s gross is the 143rd highest ever in North American ranks. Although &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; made the most money worldwide in 1989, &quot;Batman&quot; was able to beat &quot;The Last Crusade&quot; in North America, and made a further $150 million in home video sales. Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold more than 60 million tickets in the US.

Despite the film&#x27;s box office – over $400 million against a budget of no more than $48 million – Warner Bros. claimed it ended up losing $35.8 million and &quot;not likely to ever show a profit,&quot; which has been attributed to a case of Hollywood accounting.

===Critical response===
&quot;Batman&quot; was criticized by some for being too dark, but nonetheless received a generally positive response from critics. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 77% based on 142 reviews, with an average score of 7.1/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;An eerie, haunting spectacle, &quot;Batman&quot; succeeds as dark entertainment, even if Jack Nicholson&#x27;s Joker too often overshadows the title character.&quot; On Metacritic, the film received a weighted average score of 69 based on 21 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Many observed that Burton was more interested in the Joker and the art and set production design than Batman or anything else in terms of characterization and screentime. Comic book fans reacted negatively over the Joker murdering Thomas and Martha Wayne; in the comic book, Joe Chill is responsible. Writer Sam Hamm said it was Burton&#x27;s idea to have the Joker murder Wayne&#x27;s parents. &quot;The Writer&#x27;s Strike was going on, and Tim had the other writers do that. I also hold innocent to Alfred letting Vicki Vale into the Batcave. Fans were ticked off with that, and I agree. That would have been Alfred&#x27;s last day of employment at Wayne Manor,&quot; Hamm said.

The songs written by Prince were criticized for being &quot;too out of place&quot;. While Burton has stated he had no problem with the Prince songs, he was less enthusiastic with their use in the film. On the film, Burton remarked, &quot;I liked parts of it, but the whole movie is mainly boring to me. It&#x27;s OK, but it was more of a cultural phenomenon than a great movie.&quot;

Despite initial negative reactions from comics fans prior to the film&#x27;s release, Keaton&#x27;s portrayal of Batman was generally praised. James Berardinelli called the film entertaining, with the highlight being the production design. However, he concluded, &quot;the best thing that can be said about &quot;Batman&quot; is that it led to &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, which was a far superior effort.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; felt &quot;Jack Nicholson stole every scene&quot; but still greeted the film with positive feedback. Roger Ebert was highly impressed with the production design, but claimed &quot;&quot;Batman&quot; is a triumph of design over story, style over substance, a great-looking movie with a plot you can&#x27;t care much about.&quot; He also called the film &quot;a depressing experience&quot;. On the syndicated television series &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert&quot;, his reviewing partner Gene Siskel disagreed, describing the film as having a &quot;refreshingly adult&quot; approach with performances, direction and set design that &quot;draws you into a psychological world&quot;.

==Legacy==
Anton Furst and Peter Young won the Academy Award for Best Art Direction, while Nicholson was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor (Musical or Comedy). The British Academy of Film and Television Arts nominated &quot;Batman&quot; in six categories (Production Design, Visual Effects, Costume Design, Makeup, Sound and Actor in a Supporting Role for Nicholson), but it won none of the categories. Nicholson, Basinger, the makeup department, and costume designer Bob Ringwood all received nominations at the Saturn Awards. The film was also nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film and the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation.

The success of &quot;Batman&quot; prompted Warner Bros. Animation to create the acclaimed &quot;&quot;, as a result beginning the long-running DC Animated Universe and helped establish the modern day superhero film genre. Series co-creator Bruce Timm stated the television show&#x27;s Art Deco design was inspired from the film. Timm commented, &quot;our show would never have gotten made if it hadn&#x27;t been for that first &quot;Batman&quot; movie.&quot; Burton joked, &quot;ever since I did &quot;Batman&quot;, it was like the first dark comic book movie. Now everyone wants to do a dark and serious superhero movie. I guess I&#x27;m the one responsible for that trend.&quot;

&quot;Batman&quot; initiated the original &quot;Batman&quot; film series and spawned three sequels: &quot;Batman Returns&quot; (1992), &quot;Batman Forever&quot; (1995), and &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; (1997), the latter two of which were directed by Joel Schumacher instead of Burton and replaced Keaton as Batman with Val Kilmer and George Clooney, respectively.

Executive producers Benjamin Melniker and Michael E. Uslan filed a breach of contract lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court on March 26, 1992. Melniker and Uslan claimed to be &quot;the victims of a sinister campaign of fraud and coercion that has cheated them out of continuing involvement in the production of &quot;Batman&quot; and its sequels. We were denied proper credits, and deprived of any financial rewards for our indispensable creative contribution to the success of &quot;Batman&quot;.&quot; A superior court judge rejected the lawsuit. Total revenues of &quot;Batman&quot; have topped $2 billion, with Uslan claiming to have &quot;not seen a penny more than that since our net profit participation has proved worthless.&quot; Warner Bros. offered the pair an out-of-court settlement, a sum described by Melniker and Uslan&#x27;s attorney as &quot;two popcorns and two Cokes&quot;.

Reflecting on the twentieth anniversary of its release in a retrospective article on Salon.com, film commentator Scott Mendelson noted the continuing impact that &quot;Batman&quot; has had on the motion film industry, including the increasing importance of opening weekend box office receipts; the narrowing window between a film&#x27;s debut and its video release that caused the demise of second-run movie theaters; the accelerated acquisition of pre-existing, pre-sold properties for film adaptations that can be readily leveraged for merchandizing tie-ins; the primacy of the MPAA PG-13 as the target rating for film producers; and more off-beat, non-traditional casting opportunities for genre films. The film was responsible for the British Board of Film Classification introducing its &quot;12&quot; age rating, as its content fell between what was expected for a &quot;PG&quot; or &quot;15&quot; certificate.

The American Film Institute anointed Batman the 46th greatest movie hero and the Joker the 45th greatest movie villain on &quot;AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Heroes and Villains&quot;.

Robert Wuhl reprises his role as Alexander Knox in The CW&#x27;s Arrowverse crossover, &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;. The event also retroactively established that the world of the film and its sequel, &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, takes place on Earth-89; which is one of the worlds destroyed by the Anti-Monitor (LaMonica Garrett) during the Crisis. Michael Keaton reprises his role as Batman in &quot;The Flash&quot; set in the DC Extended Universe.

===Video games===
Several video games based on the film were released: By Ocean Software in 1989, by Sunsoft in and 1991, and by Atari Games in 1990. Konami was also in talks of releasing an arcade game around the same time as Atari.

===Comic book continuations===

In March 2016, artist Joe Quinones revealed several art designs he and Kate Leth had created to pitch a comic book continuation set in the Batman &#x27;89 universe to DC Comics. The pitch, which was rejected, would have included the story of Billy Dee Williams&#x27; Harvey Dent turning into Two-Face as well as the inclusion of characters such as Batgirl in a story that took place following the events of &quot;Batman Returns&quot;. In 2021, DC announced it would be releasing a comic book continuation of the &quot;Batman &#x27;89&quot; film. The series would be written by Sam Hamm and illustrated by Joe Quinones. The comic&#x27;s synopsis revealed that it would include the return of Selina Kyle/Catwoman, an introduction of a new Robin, and the transformation of Williams&#x27; Harvey Dent into Two-Face.

A followup series was later announced by DC Comics on August 17, 2023. The first issue of the new series was released on November 28, 2023. It was written again by Sam Hamm, with art by Joe Quinones. In the series, Batman has mysteriously disappeared after Dent&#x27;s death, leading Gotham citizens to take to the streets to fight in his place, including Barbara Gordon, who becomes Batgirl. Scarecrow and Harley Quinn will be featured as the main antagonists, seemingly referencing the unproduced fifth film in the Burton and Schumacher series, &quot;Batman Unchained&quot;.

===Direct sequel novels===

On April 11, 2024, it was announced that a new novel would be released which would tie-in to the film. Announced with the title &quot;&quot;, the novel was written by author John Jackson Miller, and acts as a direct sequel to the film, being set between the events of &quot;Batman&quot; and its sequel &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, with Batman focusing on dismantling the remnants of Joker&#x27;s organization, while contemplating on the idea that Joker might not actually be dead. The novel also includes certain characters introduced in the sequel, with one example being Max Shreck. It was released on October 15, 2024, by Penguin Random House; a sequel, titled &quot;Batman: Revolution&quot;, was later revealed by Miller and is scheduled for release in fall 2025.

===Home media===
&quot;Batman&quot; has been released on various formats, including VHS, LaserDisc, DVD and Blu-ray. In an unprecedented move at the time, it was made available to buy on VHS in the United States on November 15, less than six months after its theatrical release, at a suggested retail price of only $24.95 although most sellers sold it for less. It was first released on DVD on March 25, 1997, as a double sided disc containing both Widescreen (1.85:1) and Full Screen (1.33:1) versions of the film. The 2005 &quot;Batman: The Motion Picture Anthology 1989–1997&quot; included 2-disc special edition DVDs of the film and all three of its sequels. The anthology was also released as a 4-disc Blu-ray set in 2009, with each film and its previous extras contained on a single disc. Other Blu-ray reissues include a &quot;30th Anniversary&quot; Digibook with 50-page booklet, and a steelcase edition; both also include a Digital Copy. Most recently the &quot;25th Anniversary&quot; Diamond Luxe reissue contained the same disc as before and on a second disc, a new 25-minute featurette: &quot;Batman: The Birth of the Modern Blockbuster&quot;.

The film was also included in &quot;The Tim Burton Collection&quot; DVD and Blu-ray set in 2012, alongside its first sequel, &quot;Batman Returns&quot;.

&quot;Batman&quot; was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray on June 4, 2019.

<text>Batman (also known as Batman: The Movie) is a 1966 American superhero film directed by Leslie H. Martinson. Based on the television series, and the first full-length theatrical adaptation of the DC Comics character of the same name, the film stars Adam West as Batman and Burt Ward as Robin. The film hit theaters two months after the last episode of the first season of the television series. The film includes most members of the original TV cast, with the exception of Julie Newmar as Catwoman, who, in the film, was replaced by Lee Meriwether.

==Plot==
When Batman and Robin get a tip that Commodore Schmidlapp, owner of the Big Ben Distillery, is in danger aboard his yacht, they launch a rescue mission using the Batcopter. As Batman descends on the bat-ladder to land on the yacht, it suddenly vanishes beneath him. He rises out of the sea with a shark attacking his leg. After Batman dislodges it with bat-shark repellent, the shark explodes. Batman and Robin head back to Commissioner Gordon&#x27;s office, where they deduce that the tip was a set-up by the United Underworld, a gathering of four of the most powerful villains in Gotham City: the Joker, the Penguin, the Riddler, and the Catwoman.

The four criminals equip themselves with a dehydrator that can turn humans into dust until they are rehydrated (an invention of Schmidlapp&#x27;s, who is unaware that he has been kidnapped), escape in a war-surplus, pre-atomic submarine made to resemble a penguin, and recruit three pirate-themed henchmen (Bluebeard, Morgan and Quetch). Batman and Robin learn that the yacht was really a holographic projection and return via Batboat to a buoy concealing a projector, where they are trapped on the buoy by a magnet and targeted by torpedoes. They use a radio-detonator to destroy two of the torpedoes, and a porpoise sacrifices itself to intercept the last one. Catwoman, disguised as Soviet journalist &quot;Kitayna Ireyna Tatanya Kerenska Alisoff&quot; (acronymed as Kitka) of the Moscow &quot;Bugle&quot;, helps the group kidnap Bruce Wayne and pretends to be kidnapped with him, as part of a plot to lure Batman and finish him off with another of Penguin&#x27;s explosive animals (of course unaware that Bruce Wayne is Batman&#x27;s alter-ego).

After Bruce Wayne fights his way out of captivity, he again disguises himself as Batman, and the Dynamic Duo returns to the United Underworld&#x27;s HQ, only to find a smoking bomb. Batman is met with frustration rushing all over the docks unable to locate a safe place to dispose of the bomb but finally does so in the nick of time. The Penguin disguises himself as the Commodore and schemes his way into the Batcave along with five dehydrated henchmen. This plan fails when the henchmen unexpectedly disappear into antimatter once struck: the Penguin mistakenly rehydrated them with toxic heavy water used to recharge the Batcave&#x27;s atomic pile, leaving them highly unstable. Ultimately, Batman and Robin are unable to prevent the kidnapping of the dehydrated United World Organization&#x27;s Security Council, consisting of ambassadors from Japan, the U.S, the U.S.S.R., Israel, France, Spain, West Germany, the United Kingdom, and Nigeria. Giving chase in the Batboat to retrieve them (and Miss Kitka, presumed by the duo as still captive), Robin uses a sonic charge weapon to disable The Penguin&#x27;s submarine and force it to surface, where a fist fight ensues.

Although Batman and Robin come out on top, Batman is heartbroken to discover that his &quot;true love&quot; Miss Kitka is actually Catwoman when she loses her mask. Commodore Schmidlapp accidentally breaks the powdered Council members&#x27; vials and sneezes on them, scattering the dust. Batman sets to work, constructing an elaborate Super Molecular Dust Separator to filter the mingled dust. Robin asks him whether it might be in the world&#x27;s best interests for them to alter the dust samples so that humans can no longer harm one another. In response, Batman says that they cannot do so, reminding Robin of the fate of the Penguin&#x27;s henchmen and their tainted rehydration, and can only hope for people, in general, to learn to live together peacefully on their own.

With the world watching, the Security Council is re-hydrated. All members are restored alive and well, but continue to squabble amongst themselves, totally oblivious of their surroundings; however, each of them now speaks the language and displays the stereotypical mannerisms of a nation other than their own. Batman quietly expresses his sincere hope to Robin that this &quot;strange mixing of minds&quot; does more good than harm. The duo quietly leaves United World Headquarters by climbing out of the window and descending on their bat-ropes.

==Production==
===Development===
William Dozier wanted to make a big-screen film to generate interest in his proposed &quot;Batman&quot; television series by having the feature in theaters while the first season of the series was rolling before the cameras. The studio, 20th Century-Fox, refused because it would have to cover the entire cost of a movie, while it would only have to share the cost of a TV series (a much less risky proposition).

The studio acquiesced after a 1965 screening of Columbia Pictures&#x27; 1943 &quot;The Batman&quot; serial in New York City renewed interest in the character and after the television series became phenomenally successful. The project was announced in a March 26, 1966, issue of &quot;Variety&quot; magazine.

The film features many characters from the show. It was written by series writer Lorenzo Semple Jr. and directed by Leslie H. Martinson, who had directed a pair of the television series season one episodes: &quot;The Penguin Goes Straight&quot; and &quot;Not Yet, He Ain&#x27;t&quot;. Semple Jr. completed the screenplay in 10 days. Principal photography began on April 28, 1966, and concluded within 28 days, with a further three days to complete second-unit photography.

===Casting===
The film includes most members of the original TV cast: the actors for Batman, Robin, Alfred, Gordon, O&#x27;Hara, Aunt Harriet, the Joker, the Penguin, and the Riddler all reprised their roles. Though Julie Newmar had at this point played Catwoman in two episodes of season one in the TV series, she had other commitments at that time and was replaced by Lee Meriwether in the film. According to the &quot;Biography&quot; special &quot;Catwoman: Her Many Lives&quot; aired on July 20, 2004, Newmar was unable to reprise her role because of a back injury. Catwoman was nonetheless played by Newmar once again in the following eleven episodes of season two of the series; Eartha Kitt would then play Catwoman in three episodes of season three.

Jack LaLanne has a cameo as a man on a rooftop with bikini-clad women.

===Tone and themes===
Even though it is often described (like many contemporary shows) as a parody of a popular comic-book character, some commentators believe that its comedy is not so tightly confined. They felt the film&#x27;s depiction of the Caped Crusader &quot;captured the feel of the contemporary comics perfectly&quot;. The film was made at a time when &quot;the Batman of the Golden Age comics was already essentially neutered&quot;.

Certain elements verge into direct parody of the history of Batman. The movie, like the TV series, is strongly influenced by the comparatively obscure 1940s serials of Batman, such as the escapes done almost out of luck. The penchant for giving devices a &quot;Bat-&quot; prefix and the dramatic use of stylized title cards during fight scenes acknowledge some of the conventions that the character had accumulated in various media, but the majority of &quot;Batman&quot;&#x27;s campier moments can be read as a broader parody on contemporary mid-1960s culture in general.

Furthermore, the movie represented Batman&#x27;s first major foray into Cold War issues, paying heavy attention to Polaris Missiles, war surplus submarines and taking a poke at the Pentagon. The inclusion of a glory-hunting presidential character and the unfavorable portrayal of Security Council Members marked Batman&#x27;s first attempts to poke fun at domestic and international politics.

===Vehicles===

Besides the Batmobile, other vehicles used by The Dynamic Duo include:
* Batcycle with side car
* Batboat, provided by Glastron
* Batcopter

Of the three new Batvehicles which first appeared in the &quot;Batman&quot; film, only the Batcycle properly crossed over into the TV series as the budgetary limits of the TV series precluded the full use of the others. While the Batcopter and Batboat from the movie appeared briefly in episodes (including a use of the Batboat in the conclusion of the first post-film two-parter: &quot;Walk the Straight and Narrow&quot;), they primarily did so in the form of stock-footage scenes from the film intercut into the series.

==Music==
Nelson Riddle&#x27;s original score to &quot;Batman the Movie&quot; was released in 2010 by La-La Land Records and Fox Music. The album contains the entire score as heard in the film in chronological order as well as an unreleased cue. This limited edition includes a lavishly illustrated color booklet which features exclusive liner notes by Brian Baterwhite. This Limited Edition was of 2000 units.

It was newly re-issued in 2016. While the program and master of this release is identical to the 2010 release, this reissue features all-new exclusive liner notes by John Takis and art design by Jim Titus. This new Limited Edition is of 2500 units.

==Release==
===Theatrical===
&quot;Batman&quot; premiered at the Paramount Theatre in Austin, Texas, on July 30, 1966 (between the first and second seasons of the TV series); it was moderately successful at the box office. The Batboat featured in the film was created by Austin-based company Glastron, whose payment was in having the film premiere in their hometown. In conjunction with the premiere, Jean Boone of Austin CBS affiliate station KTBC interviewed the film&#x27;s cast, including Lee Meriwether, Cesar Romero, and Adam West.

===Television===
ABC, the network which previously aired the &quot;Batman&quot; television series, first broadcast the film on the July 4, 1971, edition of &quot;The ABC Sunday Night Movie&quot;; the film was quickly rebroadcast on ABC September 4 of that year.

===Home media===
The film debuted on home video via formats VHS and Betamax release in 1985 by Playhouse Video, then apparently re-released (after a Blockbuster Video executive asked why it &quot;wouldn&#x27;t&quot; be repackaged on the heels of the successful &quot;Batman&quot; film of 1989) in 1989 by CBS/Fox Video, and in 1994 by Fox Video.

The film was released on DVD in 2001, and re-released July 1, 2008, on DVD and on Blu-ray by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment.

==Reception==
===Box office===
According to Fox records, the film needed to earn $3.2 million in rentals to break even and made $3.9 million (equivalent to $ million in ).

===Critical response===
&quot;Batman&quot; holds an 81% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on thirty-six reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;&quot;Batman: The Movie&quot; elevates camp to an art form -- and has a blast doing it, every gloriously tongue-in-cheek inch of the way.&quot; 

Bill Gibron of Filmcritic.com gave the film 3 out of 5 stars: &quot;Unlike other attempts at bringing these characters to life...the TV cast really captures the inherent insanity of the roles&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; stated in their review that &quot;the intense innocent enthusiasm of Cesar Romero, Burgess Meredith and Frank Gorshin as the three criminals is balanced against the innocent calm of Adam West and Burt Ward, Batman and Robin respectively&quot;.

==Sequels==

West and Ward reprised their roles in &quot;Batman&quot; animated movies for the show&#x27;s 50th anniversary along with Julie Newmar returning.

&quot;Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders&quot; was released on Digital HD and digital media on October 11, 2016, and on DVD and Blu-ray November 1.

A sequel to &quot;Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders&quot; called &quot;Batman vs. Two-Face&quot; was released on October 10, 2017. The film starred William Shatner voicing Two-Face as the main antagonist. Adam West completed his voiceover work, but died of leukemia in June 2017, before it was released.

<doc id="4728" wikidata="Q189054" url="?curid=4728" title="Batman Returns">
<text>Batman Returns is a 1992 American superhero film directed by Tim Burton and written by Daniel Waters. Based on the DC Comics character Batman, it is the sequel to &quot;Batman&quot; (1989) and the second installment in the 1989–1997 &quot;Batman&quot; series. In the film, Batman comes into conflict with wealthy industrialist Max Shreck and malformed crime boss Oswald Cobblepot / The Penguin, who seek power regardless of the cost to Gotham City. Their plans are complicated by Shreck&#x27;s former secretary, Selina Kyle, who seeks revenge against him as Catwoman. The cast includes Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito, Michelle Pfeiffer, Christopher Walken, Michael Gough, Pat Hingle, and Michael Murphy.

Burton had no interest in making a sequel to &quot;Batman&quot;, believing that he was creatively restricted by the expectations of Warner Bros. He agreed to return in exchange for creative control, including replacing original writer Sam Hamm with Daniel Waters, and hiring many of his previous creative collaborators. Waters&#x27;s script focused on characterization over an overarching plot, and Wesley Strick was hired to complete an uncredited re-write which, among other elements, provided a master plan for the Penguin. Filming took place between September 1991 and February 1992, on a $50–80million budget, on sets and sound stages at Warner Bros. Studios and the Universal Studios Lot in California. Special effects primarily involved practical applications and makeup, with some animatronics and computer-generated imagery.

The film&#x27;s marketing campaign was substantial, including brand collaborations and a variety of merchandise, aiming to repeat &quot;Batman&quot; financial success. Released on June 19, 1992, &quot;Batman Returns&quot; broke several box-office records and earned $266.8million worldwide. However, it failed to replicate the success or longevity of &quot;Batman&quot; ($411.6million); this was blamed on the darker tone as well as violent and sexual elements, which alienated family audiences and led to a backlash against marketing partners for promoting the film to young children. Reviews were polarized about the film, but praised most of the main cast.

After the relative failure of &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, Burton was replaced as director of the third film, &quot;Batman Forever&quot; (1995), with Joel Schumacher to take the series in a family-friendly direction. Keaton chose not to reprise his role, disagreeing with Schumacher&#x27;s vision. &quot;Batman Forever&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; (1997), were financial successes but fared less well critically. &quot;Batman Returns&quot; has been reassessed as one of the best &quot;Batman&quot; films in the decades since its release, and its incarnations of Catwoman and Penguin are considered iconic. A comic book, &quot;Batman &#x27;89&quot; (2021), continued the narrative of the original two Burton films, and Keaton reprised his version of Batman in &quot;The Flash&quot; (2023).

== Plot ==

In Gotham City, two wealthy socialites, dismayed at the birth of their malformed and feral son Oswald, discard the infant in the sewers, where he is adopted by a family of penguins. Thirty-three years later, during the Christmas season, wealthy industrialist Max Shreck is abducted by the Red Triangle gang—a group of former circus workers connected to child disappearances across the country—and brought to their hideout in the Arctic exhibit at the derelict Gotham Zoo. Their leader, Oswald—now named the Penguin—blackmails Shreck with evidence of his corruption and murderous acts to compel his assistance in reintegrating Oswald into Gotham&#x27;s elite. Shreck orchestrates a staged kidnapping of the mayor&#x27;s infant child, allowing Oswald to rescue it and become a public hero. In exchange, Oswald requests access to the city&#x27;s birth records, ostensibly to learn his true identity by researching Gotham&#x27;s first-born sons.

Shreck attempts to murder his timid secretary, Selina Kyle, by pushing her out of a window after she accidentally uncovers his scheme to construct a power plant that would secretly drain and store Gotham&#x27;s electricity. Selina survives, returns home, angrily crafts a costume and adopts the name Catwoman. To Shreck&#x27;s surprise, Selina returns to work with newfound confidence and assertiveness, immediately capturing the attention of visiting billionaire Bruce Wayne. As his alter ego, the vigilante Batman, Wayne investigates Oswald, suspecting a connection to the Red Triangle gang. To remove obstacles to his power plant, Shreck persuades Oswald to run for mayor and undermine the incumbent by unleashing Red Triangle on Gotham. Batman&#x27;s attempts to stop the chaos lead to a confrontation with Catwoman. Meanwhile, Selina and Wayne start dating, while Catwoman teams up with Oswald to tarnish Batman&#x27;s reputation.

During Gotham&#x27;s Christmas-tree lighting, Oswald and Catwoman kidnap Gotham&#x27;s beauty queen, the Ice Princess, and lure Batman to a rooftop above the ceremony. Oswald pushes the Ice Princess to her death with a swarm of bats, framing Batman. When Catwoman objects to the murder and rebuffs Oswald&#x27;s romantic advances, he attacks her, sending her crashing through a glasshouse. Batman escapes in the Batmobile, unaware that the Red Triangle gang has sabotaged it, allowing Oswald to take it on a remote-controlled rampage. Before regaining control, Batman records Oswald&#x27;s insulting tirade against Gotham&#x27;s citizens and plays it during Oswald&#x27;s mayoral rally, destroying his public image and forcing him to retreat to Gotham Zoo. There, Oswald renounces his humanity, fully embracing his identity as the Penguin, and sets his plan in motion to abduct and kill Gotham&#x27;s first-born sons as revenge for his own abandonment.

Selina attempts to kill Shreck at his charity ball, but Wayne intervenes, and they accidentally discover each other&#x27;s secret identities. Penguin crashes the event, intending to kidnap Shreck&#x27;s son, Chip, but Shreck offers himself instead. Batman disrupts the Red Triangle gang and halts the kidnappings, forcing the Penguin to unleash his missile-equipped penguin army to destroy Gotham. However, Batman&#x27;s butler, Alfred Pennyworth, overrides the control signal, redirecting the penguins back to Gotham Zoo. As the missiles obliterate the zoo, Batman unleashes a swarm of bats, causing the Penguin to fall into the contaminated waters of the Arctic exhibit. Catwoman arrives to confront Shreck, rejecting Batman&#x27;s plea to abandon her quest for vengeance and leave with him. Shreck shoots her four times, but she seems unaffected, claiming she has two of her nine lives left. Catwoman electrocutes Shreck, causing a power surge that appears to kill them both; however, Batman finds only Shreck&#x27;s charred remains. The Penguin emerges one last time but succumbs to his injuries before he can attack Batman. His penguins lay him to rest in the water.

Sometime later, as Alfred drives Wayne home, he spots Selina&#x27;s silhouette but finds only a cat, which he takes with him. The Bat-Signal shines above the city as Catwoman gazes up at it.

==Production==

===Development===

Following the success of &quot;Batman&quot; (1989), which became the fifth-highest-grossing film of its time, a sequel was considered inevitable. Warner Bros. Pictures was confident in its potential, with discussions about a follow-up beginning by late 1989 and plans to start filming in May of the next year. The studio wanted Robin Williams and Danny DeVito to play the rogues Riddler and Penguin, respectively, and had also invested $2million in acquiring the Gotham City sets at Pinewood Studios in England, intending to use them for at least two more sequels. These sets were kept under 24-hour surveillance as it was more cost-effective to maintain them than to build new ones. Despite pressure from Warner Bros. to finalize a script and begin production, director Tim Burton was hesitant about returning for a sequel. He called the idea &quot;dumbfounded,&quot; particularly before analyzing the performance of the first film. Burton was generally skeptical of sequels, believing they were only worthwhile if they offered a chance to explore something new and different.

&quot;Batman&quot; writer Sam Hamm&#x27;s initial story idea expanded the character of district attorney Harvey Dent, played in &quot;Batman&quot; by Billy Dee Williams, and his descent into the supervillain Two-Face. Warner Bros. wanted the main villain to be the Penguin, however, whom Hamm believed the studio saw as Batman&#x27;s most prominent enemy after the Joker. Catwoman was added because Burton and Hamm were interested in the character. Hamm&#x27;s drafts continued directly from &quot;Batman&quot;, focusing on the relationship between Wayne and Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger) and their engagement. The Penguin was written as an avian-themed criminal who uses birds as weapons; Catwoman was more overtly sexualised, wore &quot;bondage&quot; gear, and nonchalantly murdered groups of men. The main narrative teamed Penguin and Catwoman to frame Batman for the murders of Gotham&#x27;s wealthiest citizens in their pursuit of a secret treasure. Their quest leads them to Wayne Manor, and reveals the Waynes&#x27;s secret history. Among other things, Hamm originated the Christmastime setting and introduced Robin, Batman&#x27;s sidekick, although his idea for assault rifle-wielding Santas was abandoned. Hamm ensured that Batman did not kill anyone and focused on protecting Gotham&#x27;s homeless. The two drafts produced by Hamm failed to renew Burton&#x27;s interest, and Burton concentrated on directing &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; (1990) and writing &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; (1993) instead.

Burton was confirmed to direct the sequel in January 1991, with filming scheduled to begin later that year for a 1992 release date. He agreed to return in exchange for creative control on the sequel; Burton considered &quot;Batman&quot; the least favorite of his films, describing it as occasionally boring. According to Denise Di Novi, his long-time producer, &quot;Only about 50% of &quot;Batman&quot; was [Burton]&quot;; the studio wanted &quot;Batman Returns&quot; to be &quot;more of a Tim Burton movie... [a] weirder movie but also more hip and fun.&quot;

Burton replaced key &quot;Batman&quot; crew with some of his former collaborators, including cinematographer Stefan Czapsky, production designer Bo Welch, creature-effects supervisor Stan Winston, makeup artist Ve Neill, and art directors Tom Duffield and Rick Henrichs. Daniel Waters was hired to replace Hamm because Burton wanted someone with no emotional attachment to &quot;Batman&quot; and liked Waters&#x27;s script for the dark comedy &quot;Heathers&quot; (1988), which matched Burton&#x27;s intended tone and creative direction. Burton reportedly disliked &quot;Batman&quot; producer Jon Peters, demoted him to executive producer of &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, and effectively barred him from the set. Warner Bros. was the production company and distributor, with production assistance from executive producer Peter Guber&#x27;s and Peters&#x27;s Polygram Pictures.
===Writing===

Waters began writing his first draft in mid-1990. Burton&#x27;s only instructions were that the script have no connection to &quot;Batman&quot;, outside of a singular reference to Vale as Wayne&#x27;s ex-girlfriend, and that Catwoman have a greater characterization than sexy vixen. Waters did not like the 1989 film, and had no interest in following its narrative threads, acknowledging the comic-book histories of &quot;Batman Returns&quot;″ characters, or considering the opinions of their fans, saying: &quot;We were really just about the art.&quot; Unlike Hamm, Waters was not opposed to Batman killing people, believing the character should reflect contemporary, darker times, and that the idea of a hero leaving captured villains for the authorities was outdated. Even so, Waters only had Batman kill when necessary so it would be more meaningful; he was unhappy with some of the unscripted on-screen deaths in the finished film, such as Batman blowing up a Red Triangle member. Much of Waters&#x27;s &quot;bitter and cynical&quot; dialogue for Batman (such as Gotham City not deserving protection) was removed because Keaton said that Batman should rarely speak in costume and Burton wanted Batman to be driven by trauma not nihilism.

As a result, the script focused on villains. Burton said that he initially struggled to understand the appeal of the Penguin&#x27;s comic-book counterpart; Batman, Catwoman, and the Joker had clear psychological profiles, but the Penguin was &quot;just this guy with a cigarette and a top hat.&quot; The initial draft made the character resemble a stereotypical DeVito character (an abrasive gangster), but Waters and Burton agreed to make him more &quot;animalistic&quot;. They decided to make the Penguin a tragic figure, abandoned as an infant by his parents—a reflection of Batman&#x27;s childhood trauma of losing his parents. Political and social satire was added, influenced by two episodes of the 1960s television series, &quot;Batman&quot;, (&quot;Hizzoner the Penguin&quot; and &quot;Dizhonner the Penguin&quot;) in which the Penguin runs for mayor. Waters changed Hamm&#x27;s Catwoman from a &quot;fetishy sexual fantasy&quot; &quot;femme fatale&quot; to a working-class, disenchanted secretary, writing her as an allegory of contemporary feminism. Although the character is influenced by feline mythology (such as cats having nine lives), Waters and Burton never intended the supernatural elements to be taken literally and planned for Catwoman to die with Shreck during the electrical explosion in the film&#x27;s denouement.

Waters created Max Shreck—an original character named in honor of actor Max Schreck—to take the place of Harvey Dent/Two-Face. Shreck was written satirically as an evil industrialist who orchestrates the Penguin&#x27;s mayoral run, in order to convey the message that true villains do not always wear costumes. In one version of the script, Shreck was the Penguin&#x27;s more-favored brother. With four central characters to depict, Waters and Burton decided to remove Robin, a garage mechanic who helps Batman after Penguin crashes the Batmobile. They were not particularly interested in retaining the character, whom Waters described as worthless. The Red Triangle gang, initially conceived as a troupe of performance artists, were changed to circus clowns at Burton&#x27;s request.

Waters said that his 160-page first draft was too outlandish and would have cost $400million to produce, leading him to become more restrained. His fifth (and final draft) focused more on characterization and interaction than on plot. Burton and Waters eventually fell out over disagreements about the script and Waters&#x27;s refusal to implement requested changes. Burton hired Wesley Strick to refine Waters&#x27;s work, streamline dialogue, and lighten the tone. Warner Bros. executives mandated that Strick introduce a master plan for the Penguin, resulting in the addition of the plot to kidnap Gotham&#x27;s first-born sons and threaten the city with missiles. Waters said that the changes to his work were relatively minor, but he was baffled by the Penguin&#x27;s master plan. He made a final revision to Strick&#x27;s shooting screenplay and, although Strick was on set for four months of filming and agreed-upon rewriting, Waters was the only screenwriter credited.

===Casting===

Keaton reprised his role as Bruce Wayne / Batman for $10million, double his salary for &quot;Batman&quot;. Burton wanted to cast Marlon Brando as the Penguin, but Warner Bros. preferred Dustin Hoffman. Christopher Lloyd and Robert De Niro were also considered, but Danny DeVito became the frontrunner when Waters re-envisioned the character as a deformed human-bird hybrid. DeVito was initially reluctant to accept the role until he was convinced by his close friend, Jack Nicholson, who played the Joker in &quot;Batman&quot;. To convey his vision, Burton gave DeVito a picture he had painted of a diminutive character sitting on a red-and-white striped ball with the caption, &quot;my name is Jimmy, but my friends call me the hideous penguin boy.&quot;

Casting Selina Kyle / Catwoman was difficult. Annette Bening initially secured the role, but had to drop out after becoming pregnant. Actresses lobbying for the part then included Ellen Barkin, Cher, Bridget Fonda, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Madonna, Julie Newmar, Lena Olin, Susan Sarandon, Raquel Welch, and Basinger. The most prominent candidate, however, was Sean Young (who was cast as Vale in &quot;Batman&quot; before she was injured). Young went to the Warner Bros. lot in a homemade Catwoman costume for an impromptu audition for Burton, who reportedly hid under his desk (although Keaton and producer Mark Canton briefly met with her). She shared video of her efforts with &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;. Warner Bros. said that Young did not fit their vision for Catwoman.

The role went to Pfeiffer who was described as a proven actress who got along with Burton (although some publications said that it would stretch her acting abilities). Pfeiffer had also been considered for Vale in &quot;Batman&quot;, but Keaton vetoed the casting because they had been romantically involved and he believed that her presence would interfere with attempts to reconcile with his wife. She received a $3million salary ($2million more than Bening), plus a percentage of the gross profits. Pfeiffer trained for months in kickboxing with her stunt double, Kathy Long, mastering the whip and becoming proficient enough to perform her own stunts with the weapon.

Shreck&#x27;s appearance was modeled on Vincent Price in an (unnamed) older film, and Walken based his performance on moguls such as Sol Hurok and Samuel Goldwyn. He said, &quot;I tend to play mostly villains and twisted people. Unsavory guys. I think it&#x27;s my face, the way I look.&quot; Burgess Meredith (who played the Penguin in the 1960s TV series) was scheduled to make a cameo appearance as Penguin&#x27;s father, Tucker Cobblepot, but became ill during filming. He was replaced by Paul Reubens; Diane Salinger played his wife, Esther. Both had starred in Burton&#x27;s feature-film debut, &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot; (1985).

Although Robin was removed from the screenplay, the character&#x27;s development was far enough along that Marlon Wayans was cast in the role (Burton had specifically wanted an African-American Robin) and costumes, sets, and action figures were made. In a 1998 interview, Wayans said that he still received residual checks as part of the two-film contract he signed. Early reports suggested that Nicholson had been asked to return as the Joker, but refused to film in England because of the salary tax on foreign talent. Nicholson denied being asked, however, believing that Warner Bros. would not want to replicate his generous compensation for &quot;Batman&quot;.
===Filming===

Principal photography began on September 3, 1991. Burton wanted to film in the United States with American actors because he believed that &quot;Batman&quot;, which had been filed in the United Kingdom, had &quot;suffered from a British subtext.&quot; The economics of filming &quot;Batman&quot; in the United Kingdom had also changed, making it more cost-effective to remain in the U.S. This meant abandoning the Pinewood Studios sets in favor of Burton&#x27;s new design. &quot;Batman Returns&quot; was filmed entirely on up to eight soundstages at Warner Bros. Studios, Burbank, California, including Stage 16 (which housed the expansive Gotham Plaza set). An additional soundstage, Stage 12 at the Universal Studios Lot, was used for the Penguin&#x27;s Arctic-exhibit lair.

Some sets were kept very cold for the live Emperor, black-footed, and King penguins. The birds were flown in on a refrigerated airplane for filming, and had a chilled waiting area containing a swimming pool stocked with half a ton of ice daily and fresh fish. DeVito said that he generally liked being on set but disliked the cold conditions, and was the only person somewhat comfortable because of his costume&#x27;s heavy padding. To create the penguin army, the live penguins were supplemented with puppets, forty Emperor-penguin suits worn by little people, and Computer-generated imagery (CGI). People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) protested the use of real penguins, objecting to the birds being moved from their natural environment. Although the organization had reportedly said that the penguins were not mistreated during filming, it later complained that the birds did not get fresh drinking waterjust a small, chlorinated pool. PETA also objected to the penguins being fitted with appliances representing weapons and gadgets, which Warner Bros. said were lightweight plastic. Burton said that he did not like using real animals because he had an affinity for them, and ensured that the penguins were treated with care.

Walken described the filming as very collaborative, recalling that his suggestion to add a blueprint for Shreck&#x27;s power plant resulted in a model being built within a few hours. The scene of Catwoman putting a live bird in her mouth was performed live, with no CGI enhancements. Pfeiffer said that, in retrospect, she would not have done the stunt as she had not considered the risks of injury or disease involved. For a scene in the sewers, monkey handlers positioned above and below managed the organ grinder monkey as it descended a set of stairs with a note for Penguin. When it saw DeVito in full costume and makeup, it leapt at his testicles. DeVito said, &quot;The monkey looked at me, froze, and then leapt right at my balls...Thank god it was a padded costume.&quot; A scene of Shreck&#x27;s superstore exploding caused minor injuries to four stuntmen. Principal photography ended on February 20, 1992, after 170 days.

===Post-production===
Chris Lebenzon edited &quot;Batman Returns&quot;″ 126-minute theatrical cut. The final scene of Catwoman looking up at the Bat Signal was filmed during post-production, only two weeks before the film&#x27;s release. Warner Bros. mandated the scene (depicting that the character survived) after test audiences responded positively to Pfeiffer&#x27;s performance. Pfeiffer was unavailable to film the scene, and a stand-in was used. A scene of Penguin&#x27;s gang destroying a store filled with Batman merchandise was removed. Warner Bros. provided a final budget for &quot;Batman Returns&quot; of $55million, although it has been reported (or estimated) as $50, $65, $75, or $80million.

===Music===
Danny Elfman was initially reluctant to score &quot;Batman Returns&quot; because he was unhappy that his &quot;Batman&quot; score was supplemented with pop music by Prince. Elfman built on many of his &quot;Batman&quot; themes, and said that he enjoyed working on the Penguin&#x27;s themes the most because of the character&#x27;s sympathetic aspects, such as his abandonment and death. Recorded with a studio orchestra on the Sony Scoring Stage in Los Angeles, Elfman&#x27;s score includes vocals, harps, bells, xylophones, flutes, pianos, and chimes.

The song &quot;Face to Face&quot;, played during the costume-ball scene, was co-written and performed by the British rock band Siouxsie and the Banshees. Burton and Elfman fell out during production due to the stress of finishing &quot;Batman Returns&quot; on time, but reconciled shortly afterward.

==Design and effects==
&quot;Batman&quot; production designer Anton Furst was replaced by Bo Welch, who understood Burton&#x27;s visual intentions after previous collaborations on &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; (1988) and &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; (1990). Furst, already occupied on another project, committed suicide in November 1991. Warner Bros. maintained a high level of security for &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, requiring the art department to keep their window blinds closed. Cast and crew had to wear ID badges with the film&#x27;s working title, &quot;Dictel&quot;, a word coined by Welch and Burton meaning &quot;dictatorial&quot;; they were unhappy with the studio&#x27;s &quot;ridiculous gestapo&quot; measures. Welch designed the Batboat vehicle, a programmable batarang, and the Penguin&#x27;s weaponized umbrellas. He added features to the Batmobile, such as detaching much of its exterior to fit through tighter spaces; this version was called the &quot;Batmissile&quot;.

===Sets===
The sets were redesigned in Welch&#x27;s style, including the Batcave and Wayne Manor. They were spread across seven soundstages on the Warner Bros. lot (the largest of which had ceilings) and the largest set owned by Universal Pictures. &quot;Batman Returns&quot; was filmed on sets, although some panoramic shots (such as the camera traveling from the base of Shreck&#x27;s department store to its cat-head-shaped office) were created with detailed miniatures.

Welch found it difficult to create something new without deviating from Furst&#x27;s award-winning work. The designs were intended to appear as a separate district of Gotham; if &quot;Batman&quot; took place on the East Side, &quot;Batman Returns&quot; was set on the West Side. Welch was influenced by German Expressionism, neo-fascist architecture (including Nazi Germany-era styles), American precisionism painters, and photos of the homeless living on the streets in affluent areas. He incorporated Burton&#x27;s rough sketch of Catwoman, which had a &quot;very S&amp;M kind of look&quot;, by adding chains and steel elements which would appear to hold together a city on the verge of collapse. The key element for Welch came early in design, when he realized that he wanted to manipulate spaces to convey specific emotions (emphasizing vertical buildings to convey a &quot;huge, overwhelmingly corrupt, decaying city&quot; filled with small people): &quot;The film is about this alienating, disparate world we live in.&quot; The wintertime setting took advantage of the contrast between black and white scene elements, influenced by &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (1941) and &quot;The Third Man&quot; (1949).

Welch&#x27;s concept designs began by carving out building shapes from cardboard with images of fascist sculptures and depression era machine-age art. The resulting -tall rough model represented Gotham Plaza, described as a futuristic, oppressive, and &quot;demented caricature&quot; of Rockefeller Center. It was designed overbuilt, emphasizing the generic-but-oppressive heart of Gotham&#x27;s corruption. Despite complaints from the film&#x27;s financiers about its necessity, Burton insisted on the location with a detailed church overshadowed by plain surroundings.

Designs attempted to create the illusion of space; the Wayne Manor set was partially built (consisting primarily of a large staircase and fireplace) with a scale which implied that the rest of the structure was massive. Penguin&#x27;s base was initially scheduled to be built in a standard tall Warner Bros. soundstage, but Welch thought that it lacked &quot;majesty&quot; and did not create enough contrast between itself and the &quot;evil, filthy, little bug of a man&quot;. A -tall Universal stage was acquired for the production, its raised ceilings making it seem more realistic and less like a set. Minor modifications were made to the set throughout the film to make it appear to be gradually deteriorating. The location featured a water tank filled with of water surrounding a faux-ice island. Selina Kyle&#x27;s apartment had a large steel beam running through its center to appear as if it had been built around a steel girder, which Welch said made it depressing and ironic. The wood used to build the sets was donated to Habitat for Humanity to help build low-cost homes for the poor.

===Costumes and makeup===

Bob Ringwood and Mary E. Vogt were the costume designers. They refined the Batsuit to create the illusion of mechanical parts built into the torso, intending Batman to resemble Darth Vader. Forty-eight foam-rubber Batsuits were made for &quot;Batman Returns&quot;. They had a mechanical system of bolts and spikes beneath the breast plate to secure the cowl and cape because &quot;otherwise, if [Keaton] turned around quickly the cape would stay where it was&quot;, due to its weight. Costumer Paul Barrett-Brown said that the suit had a &quot;generous codpiece&quot; for comfort, and initially included a zippered fly to allow Keaton to use the bathroom; the actor declined, however, because it could be seen by the camera from some angles. As with the &quot;Batman&quot; costume, Keaton could not turn his head; he compensated by making bolder, more powerful movements with his lower body.

The Catwoman outfit was made from latex because it was designed to be &quot;black and sexy and tight and shiny&quot;. The material was chosen because of its association with &quot;erotic and sexual&quot; situations, reflecting the character&#x27;s transition from a repressed secretary to an extroverted, erotic female. Padding was added because Pfeiffer was less physically endowed than Bening; this worked to Pfeiffer&#x27;s advantage, however, since Barrett-Brown said that if it was too tight it &quot;would reveal the genital area so thoroughly that you&#x27;d get an X certificate.&quot; Ringwood and Vogt thought that if the latex material tore it would not be difficult to repair; forty to seventy backup Catwoman suits were made by Western Costume, the Warner Bros. costume department, and Los Angeles-based clothing manufacturer Syren at a cost of $1,000 each. Other versions, made for Pfeiffer from a cast of her body, were so tight that she had to be covered in baby powder to wear them. Barrett-Brown said that because of the material, it was possible to get into the suit when dry; they could not re-use them, however, because of sweat and body oils. Vin Burnham constructed Catwoman&#x27;s headpiece and mask.

Burton was influenced to add stitching by calico cats, but the stitching came apart. Ringwood and Vogt struggled with adding stitching to latex. They tried to sculpt stitching and glue it on, but did not like the look and went over the suit with liquid silicon while it was worn (which added a shine to everything). Pfeiffer said that the suit was like a second skin, but when worn for long periods it was uncomfortable; there was no way to use the restroom and it would stick to her skin, occasionally causing a rash. She found the mask similarly confining, describing it as choking her or &quot;smashing my face&quot;, and would catch the claws on nearby objects.

Stan Winston Studio created an &quot;over-the-top Burtonesque&quot; visual for the Penguin, without obscuring DeVito&#x27;s face. Concept artist Mark McCreery drew a number of sketches for the look, from which Legacy Effects built noses on a lifecast of DeVito&#x27;s face. Winston was unhappy with the &quot;pointy nose&quot; shapes and began sculpting ideas with clay, influenced by his work on &quot;The Wiz&quot; (1978) (which involved a forehead and brow prosthetic appliance for large-beaked creatures). The final makeup included a T-shaped appliance which went over DeVito&#x27;s nose, lip and brow as well as crooked teeth, whitened skin and dark circles under his eyes. Ve Neill applied the makeup, made by John Rosengrant and Shane Mahan. The several pounds of facial prosthetics, body padding, and prosthetic hands took four-and-a-half hours to apply to DeVito, but was reduced to three hours by the end of filming. An air bladder was added to the costume to help reduce its weight. DeVito helped create the Penguin&#x27;s black saliva with the makeup and effects teams, using a mild mouthwash and food coloring which he squirted into his mouth before filming, and said its taste was acceptable. Burton described DeVito as completely in-character in costume, and he &quot;scared everybody&quot;. While re-dubbing some of his dialogue, DeVito struggled to get into character without the makeup and had it applied to improve his performance. Because of the secrecy surrounding his character&#x27;s appearance before marketing, DeVito was not allowed to discuss it with others (including his family). A photo leaked to the press, and Warner Bros. employed a firm of private investigators in a failed attempt to track down the source.

===Penguins===
Stan Winston Studio provided animatronic penguins and costumes to supplement Penguin&#x27;s army. Thirty animatronic versions were made: ten each of the black-footed, King, and Emperor penguins. Costumes worn by little people were slightly larger than the animatronics; the actors controlled walking, the mechanized heads were remote-controlled and the wings were puppeteered. Dyed black chicken feathers were used for the penguin bodies. McCreery&#x27;s designs for the penguin army initially included a flamethrower, which was replaced with a rocket launcher. Mechanical-effects designers Richard Landon and Craig Caton-Largent supervised the manufacture of the animatronics, which required nearly 200 different mechanical parts to control the head, neck, eyes, beak, and wings. Boss Film Studios produced the CGI penguins.

==Release==
===Context===

By the theatrical summer of 1992 (beginning the last week of May), the film industry was struggling with low ticket sales, rising production costs, and several box-office failures the previous year. Eighty-nine films were scheduled for release during the season, including &quot;A League of Their Own&quot;, &quot;Alien 3&quot;, &quot;Encino Man&quot;, &quot;Far and Away&quot;, &quot;Patriot Games&quot;, and &quot;Sister Act&quot;. Studios had to carefully schedule their releases to avoid competition from anticipated blockbusters, such as &quot;Lethal Weapon 3&quot; and &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, as well as the 1992 Summer Olympics. &quot;Batman Returns&quot; was predicted to be the summer&#x27;s biggest success, and other studios were reportedly concerned about releasing their films within even a few weeks of its premiere. Paramount Pictures increased the budget of &quot;Patriot Games&quot; by $14million just to make it more competitive with &quot;Batman Returns&quot; and &quot;Lethal Weapon 3&quot;.

===Marketing===
Franchising had not been considered an important aspect of &quot;Batman&quot; prior to its release. However, after merchandise contributed about $500million to its $1.5billion total earnings, it was prioritized for &quot;Batman Returns&quot;. Warner Bros. delayed major promotion until February 1992, to avoid over-saturation and the risk of driving away audiences. A 12-minute promotional reel debuted at WorldCon in September 1991, alongside a black-and-white poster of a silhouetted Batman, which was called &quot;mundane&quot; and uninspiring. A trailer was released in 5,000 theaters in February 1992 with a new poster of a snow-swept Batman logo. The campaign focused on the three central characters (Batman, Penguin, and Catwoman), which Warner Bros. believed would offset the loss of the popular Nicholson. Over two-thirds of the 300 posters Warner Bros. installed in public places were stolen. Warner Bros. eventually offered 200 limited-edition posters for $250, signed by Keaton, who donated his earnings to charity.

Over $100million was expected to be spent on marketing, including $20million by Warner Bros. for commercials and trailers, and $60million by merchandising partners. The partners, which included McDonald&#x27;s, Ralston Purina, Kmart, Target Corporation, Venture Stores, and Sears, planned to host about 300 in-store Batman shops. McDonald&#x27;s converted 9,000 outlets into Gotham City restaurants, offering Batman-themed packaging and a cup lid which doubled as a flying disc. CBS aired a television special, &quot;The Bat, The Cat, The Penguin... Batman Returns&quot;, and Choice Hotels sponsored the hour-long &quot;The Making of Batman Returns&quot;. Television advertisements featured Batman and Catwoman fighting over a can of Diet Coke, and the Penguin (and his penguins) promoted Choice Hotels. Advertisements also appeared on billboards and in print (three consecutive pages in some newspapers), targeted at older audiences.

===Box office===
&quot;Batman Returns&quot; premiered on June 16, 1992, at Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. Two blocks of Hollywood Boulevard were closed for over 3,000 fans, 33 TV film crews, and 100 photographers. A party was held afterwards on the Stage 16 Gotham Plaza set for guests who included Keaton, Pfeiffer, DeVito, Burton, DiNovi, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Faye Dunaway, James Caan, Mickey Rooney, Harvey Keitel, Christian Slater, James Woods, and Reubens.

The film had a limited, preview release in the U.S. and Canada on Thursday, June 18, earning $2million. It had a wide release the following day, and was shown on an above-average 3,000 screens in 2,644 theaters. &quot;Batman Returns&quot; earned $45.7million during its opening weekend (an average of $17,729 per theater), and was the number-one film—ahead of &quot;Sister Act&quot; fourth weekend ($7.8million) and &quot;Patriot Games&quot;″ third ($7.7million). This figure broke the record for the highest-grossing opening weekend, set by &quot;Batman&quot; ($42.7million). The film held this record until the release of &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; ($50.1million) the next year. Initial performance analysis suggested that &quot;Batman Returns&quot; could become one of the all-time highest-grossing films; Warner Bros. executive Robert Friedman said, &quot;We opened it the first real weekend when kids are out of school. The audience is everybody, but the engine that drives the charge are kids under 20.&quot; According to &quot;Patriot Games&quot; producer Mace Neufeld, other films benefited from overflow audiences for &quot;Batman Returns&quot; who did not want to wait in long lines or were turned away from sold-out screenings.

&quot;Batman Returns&quot; earned $25.4million in its second weekend (a 44.3-percent drop) and was the number-one film again, ahead of the premiering &quot;Unlawful Entry&quot; ($10.1million) and &quot;Sister Act&quot; ($7.2million). By the film&#x27;s third weekend, it was the second=fastest film to gross $100million (11 days), behind &quot;Batman&quot; (10 days). It remained the number-one film with a gross of $13.8million (a 45.6-percent drop), ahead of the premiering &quot;A League of Their Own&quot; ($13.7million) and &quot;Boomerang&quot; ($13.6million). &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called its week-over-week drops troublesome, and industry analysis suggested that &quot;Batman Returns&quot; would not replicate the longevity of &quot;Batman&quot;″s theatrical run. &quot;Batman Returns&quot; never regained the number-one position after falling to numberfour over its fourth weekend, and left the top-ten highest-grossing films by its seventh. The film left theaters in late October after 18 weeks, with a total gross of $162.8million. It became the third-highest-grossing film of 1992, behind &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&quot; ($173.6million) and &quot;Aladdin&quot; ($217.3million).

&quot;Batman Returns&quot; earned an estimated $104million outside the U.S. and Canada, including a record-setting £2.8million opening weekend in the United Kingdom. This broke the record set by &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; (1991), making it the first film to gross more than £1million in a single day. Worldwide, &quot;Batman Returns&quot; grossed $266.8million, making it the sixth-highest-grossing film of 1992, ahead of &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; ($243.2million) and behind &quot;Lethal Weapon 3&quot; ($321.7million).

==Reception==
===Critical response===

&quot;Batman Returns&quot; had a polarized reception from professional critics. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of B on an A+-to-F scale.

Several reviewers compared &quot;Batman Returns&quot; and &quot;Batman&quot;; some suggested that the sequel had faster pacing and more comedy and depth, avoiding &quot;Batman&quot; &quot;dourness&quot; and &quot;tedium&quot;. Critics generally agreed that Burton&#x27;s creative control made &quot;Batman Returns&quot; a more personal work than &quot;Batman&quot;, something &quot;fearlessly&quot; different which could be judged on its own merits. Critics such as Kenneth Turan, however, said that Burton&#x27;s innovative, impressive visuals made &quot;Batman Returns&quot; feel cheerless, claustrophobic and unexciting, and were often emphasized at the expense of the plot. According to Owen Gleiberman, Burton&#x27;s fantastic elements were undermined because he did not establish a base of normality.

The plot had a mixed response. Some reviewers praised the first and second acts and interesting characters who could evoke audience emotion. Others said that it lacked suspense, thrills, or clever writing, overwhelmed by too many characters and near-constant banter. The ending was criticized for lackluster action and failing to bring the separate character threads to a satisfactory conclusion. According to Janet Maslin, Burton cared mainly about visuals and plot was a secondary consideration. Gene Siskel said that the emphasis on characterization was detrimental; the sympathetic villains left him hoping that Batman would not win, and each character would find emotional peace.

Reviewers generally agreed that despite Keaton&#x27;s abilities, his character was ignored by the script in favor of the villains; scenes without him were among the best. Todd McCarthy described Batman as a symbol of good rather than a psychologically complete character, and Ebert wrote that &quot;Batman Returns&quot; depicts being Batman as a curse instead of a heroic power fantasy. Peter Travers, however, said that Keaton&#x27;s &quot;manic depressive hero&quot; was a deep, realized character in spite of the film&#x27;s faster pace. DeVito was praised for his energy, unique characterization, and ability to convey his character&#x27;s tragedy despite the costumes and prosthetics. Desson Howe said that Burton&#x27;s focus on the Penguin indicated his sympathy for the character. Some reviewers considered DeVito an inferior followup to Nicholson&#x27;s Joker, who evoked sympathy without instilling fear.

Pfeiffer received near-unanimous praise for the film&#x27;s standout performance as a passionate, sexy, ambitious, intelligent, intimidating, and fierce embodiment of feminism who offered the only respite from the otherwise-dark tone. Jonathan Rosenbaum, however, said that she did not live up to Nicholson&#x27;s villain. Turan called the scenes shared by Batman and Catwoman the film&#x27;s most interesting, and Travers said that when they take off their masks at the end they look &quot;lost and touchingly human&quot;. Burr described the ballroom scene (in which they realize each other&#x27;s secret identities) as more emotional than anything in &quot;Batman&quot;. Ebert noted that their sexual tension seemed to have been undercut for a younger audience. Walken&#x27;s performance was described as &quot;wonderfully debonair&quot;, funny and engaging, a villain who could have carried &quot;Batman Returns&quot; alone.

Welch&#x27;s production design was generally praised, offering a sleeker, brighter, more authoritarian visual style than Furst&#x27;s &quot;brooding&quot;, oppressive aesthetic. McCarthy described Welch&#x27;s ability to realize Burton&#x27;s imaginative universe as an achievement, although Gene Siskel described Welch as a &quot;toy shop window decorator&quot; compared to Furst. The costumes and makeup effects were also praised, with Maslin saying that those images would linger in the imagination long after the narrative was forgotten. Czapsky&#x27;s cinematography was well-received, even giving a &quot;lively&quot; aesthetic to the subterranean sets. The film&#x27;s violent, mature, sexual content, such as kidnappings and implied child murder, was criticized as inappropriate for younger audiences.

===Accolades===
At the 46th British Academy Film Awards, &quot;Batman Returns&quot; was nominated for Best Makeup (Ve Neill and Stan Winston) and Best Special Visual Effects (Michael Fink, Craig Barron, John Bruno, and Dennis Skotak). For the 65th Academy Awards, &quot;Batman Returns&quot; received two nomations: Best Makeup (Neill, Ronnie Specter, and Winston) and Best Visual Effects (Fink, Barron, Bruno, and Skotak), but lost both awards to &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot; and &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot; respectively. Neill and Winston received the Best Make-up award at the 19th Saturn Awards. The film received four other Saturn Award nominations for Best Fantasy Film, Best Supporting Actor (DeVito), Best Director (Burton), and Best Costume Design (Bob Ringwood, Mary Vogt, and Vin Burnham). DeVito was nominated for Worst Supporting Actor at the 13th Golden Raspberry Awards, and Pfeiffer for Most Desirable Female at the 1993 MTV Movie Awards. &quot;Batman Returns&quot; was nominated for a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation.

==After release==
===Performance analysis and aftermath===
The U.S. and Canadian box offices underperformed in 1992, with admissions down by up to five percent and about 290million tickets sold (compared to over 300million in each of the preceding four years). Industry professionals blamed the drop on the lack of quality of the films being released, considering them too derivative or dull to attract audiences. Even films considered successful had significant box-office drops week over week from apparently-negative word of mouth. Industry executive Frank Price said that the releases were not attracting the younger audiences and children which were vital to a film&#x27;s success. Rising ticket prices, competition from the Olympics, and an economic recession were also considered contributing factors to the declining figures. &quot;Batman Returns&quot; and &quot;Lethal Weapon 3&quot; contributed to Warner Bros.″ best first half-year in its history, and were expected to return over $200million to the studio from the box office. &quot;Batman Returns&quot; was considered a disappointment as a sequel to the fifth-highest-grossing film ever made, however, and fell about $114.8million short of &quot;Batman&quot;″s $411.6million theatrical gross. By July 1992, anonymous Warner Bros. executives reportedly said about the film, &quot;It&#x27;s too dark. It&#x27;s not a lot of fun.&quot;

Despite its PG-13 rating from the Motion Picture Association, warning parents that a film may contain strong content unsuitable for children, Warner Bros. received thousands of complaint letters from audiences, particularly parents, who disliked &quot;Batman Returns&quot;″ violent and sexualized content. Waters recalled the aftermath of one screening: &quot;It&#x27;s like kids crying, people acting like they&#x27;ve been punched in the stomach and like they&#x27;ve been mugged.&quot; He had anticipated, and enjoyed, some backlash, but acknowledged he may have made some mistakes. McDonald&#x27;s was criticized for its child-centered promotion and toys, and discontinued its &quot;Batman Returns&quot; campaign in September 1992. Burton said that he preferred &quot;Batman Returns&quot; to &quot;Batman&quot;, and thought it was less dark than its predecessor, despite the backlash. Although much of Hamm&#x27;s work was replaced, he defended Burton and Waters, saying that except from the merchandise, &quot;Batman Returns&quot; was never presented as child-friendly.

Warner Bros. decided to continue the series without Burton (described as &quot;too dark and odd for them&quot;), replacing him with Joel Schumacher. A rival studio executive said, &quot;If you bring back Burton and Keaton, you&#x27;re stuck with their vision. You can&#x27;t expect &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Batman&quot;&quot; (referring to the 1989 science-fiction comedy, &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&quot;). Warner Bros. was sued by executive producers Benjamin Melniker and Michael Uslan, who alleged that they had originally purchased the film-adaptation rights to the Batman character but were denied their share of the profits from &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Batman Returns&quot; by the studio&#x27;s Hollywood accounting: a method used by studios to artificially inflate a film&#x27;s production costs, making it appear unprofitable and limiting royalty (or tax) payments. The court decided in the studio&#x27;s favor, citing a lack of evidence.

=== Home media ===
&quot;Batman Returns&quot; was released on VHS and LaserDisc on October 21, 1992. Its VHS version had a lower-than-average price, to encourage sales and rentals. The film was expected to sell millions of copies and be a well-performing rental, but its success would be restricted by its content, which would appeal less to children (the main audience driving purchases). Elfman&#x27;s score was released in 1992 on compact disc (CD), and an expanded soundtrack was released in 2010.

&quot;Batman Returns&quot; was released on DVD in 1997, with no additional features. An anthology DVD box set was released in October 2005, with all the films in the Burton-Schumacher Batman film series. The &quot;Batman Returns&quot; segment had commentary by Burton, &quot;The Bat, The Cat, and The Penguin&quot; special about the making of the film, part four of the documentary &quot;Shadows of the Bat: The Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight&quot;, notes on the development of costumes, make-up and special effects, and the music video for &quot;Face to Face&quot;.

The same anthology was released on Blu-ray in 2009 with a standalone &quot;Batman Returns&quot; Blu-ray release. A 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray version was released in 2019; restored from the original 35mm negative, it included the anthology&#x27;s special features. A 4K collector&#x27;s edition was released in 2022 with a SteelBook case (with original cover art), character cards, a double-sided poster, and previously released special features.

===Other media===
About 120 products were marketed with &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, including action figures and toys by Kenner Products, Catwoman-themed clothing, toothbrushes, roller skates, T-shirts, underwear, sunglasses, towels, beanbags, mugs, weightlifting gloves, throw pillows, cookie cutters, commemorative coins, playing cards, costume jewelry, cereal, a radio-controlled Batmobile, and tortilla chips shaped like the Batman logo. Although there were about the same number of products marketed for &quot;Batman&quot;, there were fewer licensees so Warner Bros. could have more oversight. The release of &quot;&quot; later in 1992 was anticipated to extend merchandising success long after &quot;Batman Returns&quot; had left theaters. Warner Bros. used holographic labels developed by American Bank Note Holographics to detect counterfeit products.

The film&#x27;s novelization, by Craig Shaw Gardner, was published in July 1992. A roller coaster () was built at Six Flags Great America at a cost of $8million, and was later replicated at other Six Flags parks with a Batman stunt show. Several video-game adaptations titled &quot;Batman Returns&quot; were released by a number of developers on almost all available platforms; the Super Nintendo Entertainment System version was the most successful.

To celebrate the 80th anniversary of the Penguin&#x27;s first comic-book appearance, DeVito wrote &quot;Bird Cat Love&quot; a 2021 comic book story about the Penguin and Catwoman falling in love and ending the COVID-19 pandemic. &quot;Batman &#x27;89&quot;, a comic-book series first released in 2022, continues the narrative of Burton&#x27;s original two films and ignores the Schumacher sequels. Set a few years after the events of &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, &quot;Batman &#x27;89&quot; depicts the transformation of district attorney Harvey Dent into Two-Face and introduces Robin. The series was written by Hamm, with art by Joe Quinones. The Red Triangle Gang made their first appearance outside &quot;Batman Returns&quot; in the 2022 comic book &quot;Robin&quot; #15. A holiday book was released in 2022, &quot;Batman Returns: One Dark Christmas Eve: The Illustrated Holiday Classic&quot;, by Ivan Cohen.

==Thematic analysis==

===Duality===

Critic David Crow called duality a major aspect of &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, and Catwoman, Penguin, and Shreck represent warped, reflected aspects of Batman. Like Wayne (Batman), Selina (Catwoman) is driven by trauma and conflicted about her principles and desires; unlike Batman (who seeks justice), however, she seeks vengeance. Although Catwoman agrees with Batman&#x27;s appeal that they are &quot;the same, split right down the center&quot;, they still differ too much to be together. Critics Darren Mooney and Betsy Sharkey suggested that Penguin reflects Batman&#x27;s origin; each lost their parents at an early age. Shreck says that if not for his abandonment, Cobblepot and Wayne might have traveled in the same social circles. Batman is content in his loneliness, however; the Penguin wants acceptance, love and respect, despite his quest for revenge. To Mooney, &quot;Batman Returns&quot; hints that Batman&#x27;s issues with Penguin are personal rather than moral; Batman is quietly proud of being a &quot;freak&quot; (unique), and resents Penguin for displaying his &quot;freakishness&quot;. Shreck represents Wayne&#x27;s public persona if it was driven by greed, vanity, and self-interest: a populist industrialist who wins favor with cheap presents tossed into a crowd.

===Commercialism and loneliness===
Crow saw &quot;Batman Returns&quot; as a denouncement of Batman&#x27;s real-world cultural popularity and merchandising (especially in the wake of the previous film), and noted that a scene of a store filled with Batman merchandise being destroyed was removed from the film. Crow and Mooney wrote that &quot;Batman Returns&quot; is &quot;saturated with Christmas energy&quot;; it rejects the season&#x27;s conventional norms and becomes an anti-Christmas film, however, critiquing its over-commercialism and lack of true goodwill. Shreck cynically exploits Christmas tropes for his own ends (falsely portraying himself as selfless and benevolent), and the perversions of Penguin&#x27;s Red Triangle gang are a more overt rejection of the holiday.

The film focuses on loneliness and isolation during Christmastime; Wayne is introduced sitting alone in his vast mansion, inert until the Bat-Signal shines in the sky. He makes a connection with Kyle, but what they share cannot overcome their differences and he ends the film as he began italone. Critic Todd McCarthy identified isolation as a theme common to much of Burton&#x27;s work, which is emphasized in the three main characters.

Rebecca Roiphe and Daniel Cooper wrote that &quot;Batman Returns&quot; was not antisemitic, but had antisemitic imagery. The Penguin, they believed, embodied Jewish stereotypes such as &quot;... his hooked nose, pale face and lust for herring&quot; and was &quot;unathletic and seemingly unthreatening but who, in fact, wants to murder every firstborn child of the gentile community.&quot; The character joins forces with Shreck (who has a Jewish-sounding name) to disrupt and taint Christmas and Christian traditions.

===Sexuality and misogyny===
&quot;Batman Returns&quot; has overtly sexual elements. Critic Tom Breihan described Catwoman&#x27;s vinyl catsuit as &quot;pure BDSM&quot;, including the whip she wields as a weapon. The dialogue is replete with double entendres, particularly by Penguin and Catwoman; in her fights with Batman, she sensuously licks his face. Selina / Catwoman is marginalized by the central male characters, however; Shreck pushes her out of a window, the Penguin tries to kill her when she spurns his advances, and Batman attempts to capture her. She fashions a catsuit to regain order, sanity, and power, but it is gradually damaged over the course of the film and her sanity decays with it. Catwoman&#x27;s final choice is to reject Batman&#x27;s offer of a happy ending by 
abandoning her revenge against Shreck; to surrender herself to Batman&#x27;s will would allow another man to control her.

===Power and politics===
Power is a central theme for several characters; Shreck says, &quot;There&#x27;s no such thing as too much power; if my life has a meaning that&#x27;s the meaning.&quot; He uses his money to gain power, and Batman uses his fortune to fund his war against crime (unlike Penguin, who was abandoned because he did not fit the image expected by his wealthy parents). Kyle gains power by donning the Catwoman costume and embracing her anger and sexuality.

Shreck convinces Penguin to run for mayor to further his own goals, and the Penguin seeks out the acceptance and respect it would give him. Critic Caryn James wrote that &quot;Batman Returns&quot; has &quot;sharp political jabs&quot; which implies that money and image are more important than anything else. In &quot;Batman&quot;, the Joker buys citizen support by throwing them piles of money; in the sequel, Shreck and Penguin gain the support of the populace with spectacle, pandering, and corporate showmanship. The Penguin describes how he and Shreck are both seen as monsters, but Shreck is a &quot;well-respected monster and I, to date, am not.&quot; James said that the Penguin wants to change the superficial perception of himself because he wants to be accepted, but has no interest in being lovable. Only when the fickle voters turn on him, however, does he resort to his plan to kill infants who had the chances he never had. Crow believed that Burton was the most sympathetic to Penguin, and spent the most time on the character.

==Legacy==
===Cultural influence===

Retrospectives in the 2010s and 2020s noted that &quot;Batman Returns&quot; had developed an enduring legacy since its release, with &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; describing it as the most iconic comic-book film ever made. Although initially criticized for its mix of the superhero and film noir genres, the film established trends toward dark tones and complex characters which have since become an expectation of many blockbusters. Some writers said that its &quot;disturbing imagery&quot;, exploration of morality, and satire of corporate politics seemed even more relevant in the present day, as did the themes of prejudice and feminism explored in Catwoman. Burton said that he believed &quot;Batman Returns&quot; was exploring new territory at the time, but it might be considered &quot;tame&quot; by modern standards. According to &quot;the Ringer&quot;, Burton&#x27;s &quot;weird and unsettling&quot; sequel enabled future auteurs such as Christopher Nolan, Peter Jackson, and Sam Raimi to move into mainstream films.

&quot;Collider&quot; described the film as the first &quot;anti-blockbuster&quot;, defying expectations and delivering a superhero film with little action set during Christmas (despite its July release). The film&#x27;s performances, score, and visual aesthetic are considered iconic, influencing Batman-related media and incarnations of the characters for decades (such as the &quot;Batman Arkham&quot; video games). &quot;The Batman&quot; (2022) director Matt Reeves and Batman actor Robert Pattinson called &quot;Batman Returns&quot; their favorite &quot;Batman&quot; film, with Reeves ranking it alongside &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; (2008), and director Robert Eggers said that it visually inspired his film &quot;Nosferatu&quot; (2024).

Pfeiffer&#x27;s Catwoman is considered iconic, a feat of characterization and performance which influenced subsequent female-superhero-led films. Her performance is generally regarded as the best cinematic adaptation of the character (influencing future portrayals such as Zoë Kravitz&#x27;s in &quot;The Batman&quot;), one of the best comic book film characters, and among the greatest cinematic villains. In 2022, &quot;Variety&quot; ranked Pfeiffer&#x27;s Catwoman as the second-best superhero performance of the preceding fifty years, behind Heath Ledger. DeVito&#x27;s performance as the Penguin is also considered iconic, and has been listed by some publications as one of the best cinematic Batman villains.

===Modern reception===
In the years since its release, &quot;Batman Returns&quot; has been positively reappraised. It is now regarded as among the best superhero films ever made, the best sequels, and the best &quot;Batman&quot; films made. &quot;Screen Rant&quot; called it the best Batman film of the 20th century and, in 2018, &quot;Total Film&quot; named it the best Batman film. &quot;Batman Returns&quot; was number401 on &quot;Empire&quot;″s 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time. Some publications have identified &quot;Batman Returns&quot; as part of Burton&#x27;s unofficial Christmas trilogy, bookended by &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; and &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;, and it has become an alternative-holiday film along with films such as &quot;Die Hard&quot; (1988). Some publications have also listed it as one of the best Christmas films.

The film&#x27;s writer Daniel Waters recalled being told that &quot;Batman Returns&quot; was a &quot;great movie for people who don&#x27;t like Batman&quot;. Although the film was criticized for depicting Batman killing people, Waters said, &quot;To me, Batman not killing [the Joker (played by Heath Ledger)] at the end of &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; after proving he can get out of any prison, it&#x27;s like &#x27;Come on. Kill Heath Ledger. He believed that the reception to &quot;Batman Returns&quot; was improving with time, especially after the release of &quot;The Batman&quot; in 2022.

Critic Brian Tallerico said that the elements which originally upset critics and audiences are what makes it still &quot;revelatory... It&#x27;s one of the best and strangest movies of its kind ever made.&quot; Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes has a approval rating from reviews by critics, with an average score of . According to the website&#x27;s critical consensus, &quot;Director Tim Burton&#x27;s dark, brooding atmosphere, Michael Keaton&#x27;s work as the tormented hero, and the flawless casting of Danny DeVito as The Penguin and Christopher Walken as, well, Christopher Walken make the sequel better than the first.&quot; The film has a score of 68 out of 100 on Metacritic (based on 23 critics), indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

==Sequels==

Following the reception of &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, Warner Bros. intended to continue the series without Burton. Burton considered making a third film, but the studio encouraged him to make something else and he realized they did not want him to return for a sequel. The studio replaced Burton with Schumacher, who could make something more family- and merchandise-friendly. Although Burton and Keaton said they were supportive of the new director, Keaton also left the series because &quot;[the film] just wasn&#x27;t any good, man.&quot; Industry press suggested that Keaton had also asked for a $15million salary and a percentage of the profits, although his producing partner Harry Colomby said that money was not the issue.

Burton was an executive producer for the third film, &quot;Batman Forever&quot; (1995), which had a more mixed reception than &quot;Batman Returns&quot; but was a financial success. The fourth and final film, &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; (1997), was a financial and critical failure and is regarded as one of the worst blockbuster films ever made. It stalled the Batman film series for eight years until the reboot, &quot;Batman Begins&quot; (2005).

By the mid-1990s, Burton and Waters were signed to direct a Catwoman-centered film starring Pfeiffer. Waters&#x27;s plot depicted Catwoman as an amnesiac after her injuries at the end of &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, who ends up in the Las Vegas-like Oasisburg and confronts publicly-virtuous male superheroes who are secretly corrupt. Burton and Pfeiffer took on other projects in the interim, and lost interest in the film. Warner Bros. eventually developed &quot;Catwoman&quot; (2004), starring Halle Berry, which was critically panned and is considered one of the worst comic-book films ever made.

Keaton was scheduled to reprise his version of Batman in &quot;Batgirl&quot;, a proposed 2022 film that was filmed but cancelled by Warner Bros. parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery. He appeared as Batman in &quot;The Flash&quot; (2023).

<text>Batman &amp; Robin is a 1997 American superhero film based on the DC Comics characters Batman and Robin by Bill Finger and Bob Kane. It is the fourth and final installment of Warner Bros.&#x27; initial &quot;Batman&quot; film series, a sequel to &quot;Batman Forever&quot; (1995), and the only film in the series made without the involvement of Tim Burton in any capacity. Directed by Joel Schumacher and written by Akiva Goldsman, it stars George Clooney as Bruce Wayne / Batman (replacing Val Kilmer) and Chris O&#x27;Donnell as Dick Grayson / Robin, alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger, Uma Thurman, and Alicia Silverstone. The film follows the eponymous characters as they attempt to prevent Mr. Freeze (Schwarzenegger) and Poison Ivy (Thurman) from taking over the world, while at the same time struggling to keep their partnership together.

Warner Bros. fast-tracked development for &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; following the box office success of &quot;Batman Forever&quot;. Schumacher and Goldsman conceived the storyline during pre-production on &quot;A Time to Kill&quot;; Schumacher was given a mandate to make the film more toyetic than its predecessor. After Val Kilmer decided not to reprise the role of Batman, Schumacher was interested in casting William Baldwin before George Clooney won the role. Principal photography began in September 1996 and wrapped in January 1997, two weeks ahead of the shooting schedule.

&quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; premiered in Los Angeles on June 12, 1997, and went into general release on June 20. It grossed $238 million worldwide against a production budget of $125–160 million, and was considered a box office disappointment at the time. The film received generally negative reviews from critics and is considered to be one of the worst films ever made. The film&#x27;s poor reception caused Warner Bros. to cancel future &quot;Batman&quot; films, including Schumacher&#x27;s planned &quot;Batman Unchained&quot;. One of the songs recorded for the film, &quot;The End Is the Beginning Is the End&quot; by the Smashing Pumpkins, won a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 40th Annual Grammy Awards.

==Plot==

Batman and his partner, Robin, encounter a new villain, Mr. Freeze, who has left a string of diamond thefts in his wake. During a confrontation at the natural history museum, Freeze steals a large diamond and flees, freezing Robin and leaving Batman unable to pursue him. Later, Batman and Robin learn that Freeze was originally Doctor Victor Fries, a scientist working to develop a cure for a disease known as MacGregor&#x27;s syndrome, hoping to heal his terminally ill wife, Nora. After a lab accident, Fries was rendered unable to live at average temperatures and forced to wear a cryogenic suit powered by diamonds for survival.

At a Wayne Enterprises lab in Brazil, botanist Doctor Pamela Isley is working under the deranged Doctor Jason Woodrue, who has turned her research on plants into the supersoldier drug Venom. After witnessing Woodrue use the formula to turn serial killer Antonio Diego into the hulking Bane, she threatens to expose Woodrue&#x27;s experiments. Woodrue attempts to kill her by overturning a shelf of various toxins; instead, Isley is mutated by the toxins into Poison Ivy, who kills Woodrue with a poisonous kiss, destroys the lab and escapes to Gotham City with Bane, concocting a plot to use Wayne&#x27;s money to support her research. Meanwhile, Alfred Pennyworth&#x27;s niece, Barbara Wilson, makes a surprise visit and is invited by Bruce to stay at Wayne Manor until she goes back to school.

Wayne Enterprises presents a new telescope for Gotham Observatory at a press conference interrupted by Ivy. She proposes a project that could help the environment, but Bruce declines her offer, knowing it could result in genocide. Batman and Robin decide to lure Freeze out using the Wayne Family diamonds and present them at a Wayne Enterprises charity event. Ivy attends the event and decides to use her abilities to seduce Batman and Robin. Freeze crashes the party but is defeated and incarcerated at Arkham Asylum. Ivy takes an interest in Freeze and helps him escape. Dick discovers that Barbara has been participating in drag races to raise money for Alfred, who is dying of MacGregor&#x27;s syndrome; a fact he kept from Bruce and Dick, but his niece is secretly aware of his situation and is trying to find treatment for him.

Batman, Robin, and the police arrive at Freeze&#x27;s lair in response to his escape, discovering Nora preserved in a cryogenic chamber and that Freeze has developed a cure for the early stages of MacGregor&#x27;s syndrome. The villains soon secretly arrive to recover Freeze&#x27;s diamonds and Nora. Wanting Freeze for herself, Ivy cuts off the power to Nora&#x27;s chamber, steals the diamonds, and seduces Robin, escalating tensions between him and Batman. At her hideout, Ivy convinces Freeze that Batman was responsible for her attempt at Nora&#x27;s life and he then resolves to make humanity suffer for revenge, with Ivy plotting to repopulate Earth using her mutant plants afterward. Freeze and Bane commandeer Gotham Observatory and convert the new telescope into a giant freeze ray, while Ivy uses the Bat-Signal to contact Robin. Robin attempts to go after Ivy alone, but Batman convinces him not to fall for Ivy&#x27;s seduction. Barbara discovers the Batcave, where an artificial intelligence version of Alfred reveals he has made a suit for Barbara. Barbara dons the suit and becomes Batgirl, arriving at Ivy&#x27;s lair in time to help Batman and Robin subdue her.

Freeze begins to freeze Gotham over whilst Batman, Robin, and Batgirl head to Gotham Observatory together to stop him. Batman defeats Freeze in combat, while Batgirl and Robin incapacitate Bane and thaw the city. Freeze accuses Batman of taking Nora&#x27;s life, only to be shown a recording of Ivy admitting to the crime. Batman reveals that Nora survived and offers Freeze the chance to continue his research on MacGregor&#x27;s syndrome in exchange for his cure. Freeze accepts and returns to Arkham, where he is imprisoned in the same cell as Ivy, upon whom he plans to take revenge. Alfred is cured and Bruce and Dick agree to let Barbara join them in fighting crime.

==Production==
===Development===
With the box office success of &quot;Batman Forever&quot; in June 1995, Warner Bros. immediately commissioned a sequel. They hired director Joel Schumacher and writer Akiva Goldsman to reprise their duties the following August and decided it was best to fast-track production for a June 1997 target release date, which is a break from the usual three-year gap between films. Schumacher wanted to pay homage to the work of the classic &quot;Batman&quot; comic books of his childhood. The storyline of &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; was conceived by Schumacher and Goldsman during pre-production on &quot;A Time to Kill&quot;. Portions of Mr. Freeze&#x27;s backstory were based on the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;Heart of Ice&quot;, written by Paul Dini. Goldsman, however, expressed concerns about the script during pre-production discussions with Schumacher. Schumacher stated that he was given the mandate by the studio to make the film more toyetic, even when compared to &quot;Batman Forever&quot;. The studio reportedly included toy companies in pre-production meetings; Mr. Freeze&#x27;s blaster was specifically designed by toy manufacturers. Batman creator Bob Kane acted as an official consultant and was heavily involved in the production; he gave input on the film&#x27;s script as well as on set.
While Chris O&#x27;Donnell reprised the role of Robin, Val Kilmer decided not to reprise the role of Batman from &quot;Batman Forever&quot;. Schumacher admitted that he had difficulty working with Kilmer on &quot;Batman Forever&quot;. &quot;He sort of quit,&quot; Schumacher said, &quot;and we sort of fired him.&quot; Schumacher would later go on to say that Kilmer wanted to work on &quot;The Island of Dr. Moreau&quot; because Marlon Brando was cast in the film. Kilmer said that he was not aware of the fast-track production and was already committed to &quot;The Saint&quot; and &quot;Heat&quot;. David Duchovny stated he was considered for the role of Batman, joking that the reason why he was not chosen was because his nose was too big. George Clooney&#x27;s casting as Batman was suggested by Warner Bros. executive Bob Daly. Schumacher originally had interest in casting William Baldwin in Kilmer&#x27;s place, but chose Clooney after seeing his performance in &quot;From Dusk till Dawn&quot;. Schumacher felt that Clooney &quot;brought a real humanity and humor to the piece, an accessibility that I don&#x27;t think anybody else has been able to offer&quot; and that he strongly resembled the character from the comic books. Schumacher also believed that Clooney could provide a lighter interpretation of the character than Kilmer and Michael Keaton. As a consequence of time constraints, the costume department repurposed the costume worn by Val Kilmer in &quot;Batman Forever&quot; for the third act of the film.

Ed Harris, Anthony Hopkins, and reportedly Patrick Stewart were considered for the role of Mr. Freeze, before the script was rewritten to accommodate Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x27;s casting. Schumacher later denied that Stewart was ever considered. Schumacher decided that Mr. Freeze had to be &quot;big and strong like he was chiseled out of a glacier&quot;. Mr. Freeze&#x27;s armor was made by armorer Terry English, who estimated that the costume cost some $1.5 million to develop and make. To prepare for the role, Schwarzenegger wore a bald cap after declining to shave his head, wore a blue LED in his mouth, and had acrylic paint applied. The blue LEDs had to be wrapped in balloons after battery acid started leaking into Schwarzenegger&#x27;s mouth. His prosthetic makeup and wardrobe took six hours to apply each day. The extensive time spent on Schwarzenegger&#x27;s costume significantly restricted his shooting time as his contract was limited to 12 work hours a day. Schwarzenegger was paid a $25 million salary for the role. Beside Uma Thurman, Demi Moore, Sharon Stone, and Julia Roberts were considered for the role of Poison Ivy. Schumacher first became aware of Thurman through an earlier role as Venus in &quot;The Adventures of Baron Munchausen&quot;. Thurman ultimately took the role of Poison Ivy because she liked the femme fatale characterization of the character. Alicia Silverstone was the only choice for the role of Batgirl. Prior to filming, she was reported to have lost at least 10 pounds for the role. Silverstone would later recount the body shaming she encountered during promotion of the film.

===Filming and visual effects===

Principal photography was set to commence in August 1996, but did not begin until September 12, 1996. &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; finished filming in late January 1997, two weeks ahead of the shooting schedule. The shooting schedule allowed Clooney to simultaneously work on the television series &quot;ER&quot; without any scheduling conflicts. O&#x27;Donnell said that despite spending much time with Schwarzenegger off of set and during promotion for the film, they did not work a single day together during production; this was achieved by using stand-ins when one of the actors was unavailable. Stunt coordinator Alex Field taught Silverstone to ride a motorcycle so that she could play Batgirl. Filming was temporarily halted in the fall of 1996 when Mr. Freeze&#x27;s blaster prop disappeared from the film set; a police investigation was subsequently opened, culminating in the raid of a film memorabilia collector&#x27;s home. High public interest in the film caused security issues on set; according to producer Peter MacGregor-Scott, paparazzi regularly disrupted the set, and photographs of Schwarzenegger taken during filming sold for $10,000.

When comparing work on &quot;Batman Forever&quot;, O&#x27;Donnell explained that &quot;things felt much sharper and more focused, and it just felt like everything got a little softer on the second one. The first one, I felt like I was making a movie. The second one, I felt like I was making a toy commercial.&quot; He also complained about the Robin costume, saying that it was more involved and less comfortable than the one that he wore in &quot;Batman Forever&quot;, with a glued-on mask that caused sweat to pool on his face. According to John Glover, who played Dr. Jason Woodrue, &quot;Joel [Schumacher] would sit on a crane with a megaphone and yell before each take, &#x27;Remember, everyone, this is a cartoon&#x27;. It was hard to act because that kind of set the tone for the film.&quot; Several different stunt doubles were used for the roles of Batman, Robin, and Mr. Freeze, some specialized in ice skating, aerial gymnastics, and driving.

The film was shot at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California. The grounds of Greystone Mansion were used for scenes taking place at Wayne Manor. Part of the film was also shot in Vienna, Austria, Montreal, Quebec, and Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Production designer Barbara Ling stated that her influences for the design of Gotham City came from &quot;neon-ridden Tokyo and the Machine Age. Gotham is like a World&#x27;s fair on ecstasy.&quot; Although miniatures and computer-generated elements were used for some scenes, large full-scale sets were constructed, including Gotham City covered in ice. For scenes featuring people frozen by Mr. Freeze&#x27;s ice-ray, life-sized mannequins covered in fake ice were created. Several different materials were tested for the faux ice before settling on a combination of fiber resin. According to Ling, the ice effects alone took half a year to create. Rhythm &amp; Hues Studios (R&amp;H) and Pacific Data Images created the visual effects sequences, with John Dykstra and Andrew Adamson credited as the visual effects supervisors. &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; featured 450 individual visual effects shots, 150 more than &quot;Batman Forever&quot;. Motion capture was used to animate digital stunt doubles; for a scene featuring skysurfing, the department recorded the motion of a skyboarder in a wind tunnel at a military base in North Carolina.

==Music==

Elliot Goldenthal returned to score &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; after collaborating with Schumacher on &quot;Batman Forever&quot;. The soundtrack features a variety of genres by various bands and performers, showcasing alternative rock on the lead single &quot;The End Is the Beginning Is the End&quot; by The Smashing Pumpkins, and with the songs &quot;Lazy Eye&quot; by Goo Goo Dolls and R.E.M.&#x27;s &quot;Revolution&quot;. R&amp;B singer R. Kelly wrote &quot;Gotham City&quot; for the soundtrack, which was featured in the end credits and was chosen as one of the singles, reaching the top 10 in the United States and the United Kingdom. Eric Benét and Meshell Ndegeocello also contributed R&amp;B songs. Also included was the single, &quot;Look into My Eyes&quot; by the hip hop group Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, which reached the top 5. Other songs featured included electronic dance elements, including those by Moloko and Arkarna. The soundtrack was released on May 27, 1997, two weeks and three days ahead of the film&#x27;s premiere in the United States. The orchestral score for the film was never commercially released.

Lisa Schwarzbaum of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the soundtrack a &quot;C&quot; and called it &quot;as incoherent as the Batman films themselves&quot;. Retrospectively, Nicole Drum of ComicBook.com described the soundtrack as a &quot;colorful sampling of popular music at the time that feels messy, complicated, and comforting all at the same time&quot;. Filmtracks.com deemed the orchestral score an improvement over that of its predecessor &quot;Batman Forever&quot;, noting that, while borrowing several themes from the previous film, Goldenthal successfully &quot;expands upon the statements of his title theme and action material so that they are fleshed out into more accessibly enjoyable music&quot;. Nevertheless, the website compared Goldenthal&#x27;s work negatively to Danny Elfman&#x27;s scores for &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Batman Returns&quot;. In an interview with &quot;IGN&quot;, composer Hans Zimmer, who contributed the score to Christopher Nolan&#x27;s trilogy of &quot;Batman&quot; films, called Goldenthal&#x27;s theme &quot;the most glorious statement of Batman I&#x27;d ever heard&quot;. &quot;The End Is the Beginning Is the End&quot; by The Smashing Pumpkins won a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 40th Annual Grammy Awards.

==Release==
&quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; had its premiere on June 12, 1997, in Westwood, Los Angeles. The film marked the United Kingdom&#x27;s then-&quot;biggest and most expensive&quot; movie premiere. The event was held at Battersea Power Station in London, with the building decorated to look like Gotham City and Wayne Manor. Expected to be among the tent poles of the summer movie season, the film opened in the United States on June 20, 1997, in 2,934 theaters, where it remained for an average of approximately 6.2 weeks. The film was released on DVD four months later on October 22, 1997. A special edition DVD was released in 2005 that included a documentary series about the production of the film series, &quot;Shadows of the Bat: The Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight&quot;.

===Marketing===
The theatrical trailer for &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; debuted on the February 19, 1997, episode of &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;. Warner Bros. spent $125 million to market and promote the film, in addition to its $160 million production budget. Several Six Flags amusement parks introduced new roller coasters themed to the film. Batman &amp; Robin: The Chiller opened at Six Flags Great Adventure in 1997, and a Mr. Freeze-themed roller coaster opened at both Six Flags Over Texas and Six Flags St. Louis in 1998. Taco Bell launched a $20 million promotional campaign for the film, selling Batman-themed cups, collector toys, and figurines. Themed trading cards produced by Fleer and SkyBox International were also sold, some signed by Clooney, Schwarzenegger, Thurman, Silverstone, O&#x27;Donnell, and Schumacher. An eponymous tie-in video game developed by Probe Entertainment was released for the PlayStation on August 5, 1998, to mixed reviews.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; was released on June 20, 1997, in the United States and Canada, grossing $42,872,605 in its opening weekend. That made it the third-highest opening weekend gross of 1997, behind &quot;Men in Black&quot; and &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot;, and the seventh-highest non-holiday opening weekend of all time as of its release. The film would hold the record for having the highest opening weekend for an Arnold Schwarzenegger film until 2003 when it was surpassed by &quot;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines&quot;. Its opening weekend gross also remained George Clooney&#x27;s highest until the release of &quot;Gravity&quot; in 2013. It reached the number one spot at the box office during its opening weekend, beating out &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Wedding&quot; and &quot;Speed 2: Cruise Control&quot;. This would become Schwarzenegger&#x27;s most recent film to achieve this feat for five years until &quot;Collateral Damage&quot; opened in 2002. &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; declined by 63% in its second week, which was credited to poor word of mouth and early competition with &quot;Face/Off&quot;, &quot;Hercules&quot;, and &quot;Men in Black&quot;. In the UK, it had the second-highest opening ever behind &quot;Independence Day&quot; with a gross of £4,940,566 ($8.2 million) for the weekend.

The film went on to gross $107.3 million in the United States and Canada and $130.9 million internationally, coming to a worldwide total of $238.2 million. It grossed substantially less than the previous film in the series, and finished outside of the top ten films of 1997. With a production budget of $125–160 million, the film was considered to have under-performed at the box-office, although it was estimated to have at least broken even. Schumacher criticized &quot;prejudicial prerelease buzz&quot; online and false news reports as a cause for the film&#x27;s poor commercial performance. Warner Bros. acknowledged &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;″s shortcomings in the domestic market but pointed out its success in other markets. In his book &quot;Batman: the Complete History&quot;, Les Daniels analyzed the film&#x27;s relatively strong performance outside of the United States, speculating that &quot;nuances of languages or personality were likely to be lost in translation and admittedly eye-popping spectacle seemed sufficient.&quot;

===Critical response===
 Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Jay Boyar of &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; believed &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; to be the least distinctive chapter in the series, calling it a &quot;bat-smorgasbord of action, camp, pathos, spectacle and whatever&quot; and blaming its blandness on the studio&#x27;s increased involvement in its production. In his &quot;thumbs down&quot; review, Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; found the film to be &quot;wonderful to look at&quot; although it had &quot;nothing authentic at its core&quot;, criticizing its toyetic approach. Writing for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Gene Siskel, who gave positive reviews to the previous &quot;Batman&quot; films, also gave &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; a &quot;thumbs down&quot; rating, calling it a &quot;sniggering, exhausting, overproduced extravaganza&quot;. While commending the film&#x27;s visuals, Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the film &quot;indifferently acted&quot; and &quot;far too slick for even a toehold&#x27;s worth of connection&quot;, believing that it &quot;killed&quot; the &quot;Batman&quot; film series. Desson Howe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; disapproved of Schumacher&#x27;s direction and Akiva Goldsman&#x27;s script, calling it an &quot;emptily flashy, meandering fashion show of a summer flick&quot; and also believing that it should mark the end to the series. Andrew Johnston, writing in &quot;Time Out&quot;, remarked, &quot;It&#x27;s hard to tell who &quot;B&amp;R&quot; is intended for. Anyone who knows the character from the comics or the superb on Fox will be alienated. And though Schumacher treats the Adam West version as gospel, that show&#x27;s campy humor is completely incompatible with these production values.&quot; James Berardinelli questioned the &quot;random amount of rubber nipples and camera angle close-ups of the Dynamic Duo&#x27;s butts and Bat-crotches&quot;.

In his review for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, Mick LaSalle said that the film failed to &quot;convincingly inhabit the grandeur of its art direction and special effects&quot;, criticizing George Clooney as &quot;the big zero of the film&quot;, who &quot;should go down in history as the George Lazenby of the series&quot;. While deeming Clooney &quot;the most ideal Batman to date&quot; in a physical sense, Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; found the character uninteresting and Clooney &quot;unable to compensate onscreen for the lack of dimension on paper&quot;. Conversely, he described Thurman and Schwarzenegger&#x27;s performances as the villainous duo as the &quot;highlights of the film&quot;, pointing out Thurman&#x27;s &quot;comic wit conspicuously lacking elsewhere in the picture&quot;. Writing for &quot;Star Tribune&quot;, Jeff Strickler criticized its &quot;almost embarrassingly mundane&quot; dialogue and called Schwarzenegger &quot;wasted&quot; in the role of Mr. Freeze and his character &quot;drably written&quot;. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave a more positive review and praised Thurman&#x27;s performance as &quot;perfect&quot;, comparing it to Mae West&#x27;s &quot;[mix of] true femininity with the winking womanliness of a drag queen&quot;, but criticizing Silverstone and Clooney&#x27;s performances. Steven Rea of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; found Thurman at times &quot;amusing&quot; and similarly described her performance as &quot;Mae West with moss&quot;.

===Legacy===
&quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; is considered to be one of the worst superhero films and among the worst films ever made. In 2009, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige said that &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; may be the most important comic book film ever made in that it was &quot;so bad that it demanded a new way of doing things&quot; and created the opportunity to make &quot;X-Men&quot; (2000) and &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (2002) in a way that respected the source material to a higher degree. In an interview with &quot;Vice&quot; 20 years after its release, director Joel Schumacher apologized for the film while taking full responsibility for its poor reputation, stating, &quot;I want to apologize to every fan that was disappointed because I think I owe them that. A lot of it was my choice. No one is responsible for my mistakes but me.&quot; He added, &quot;I was scum. It was like I had murdered a baby&quot;, recounting his initial reaction to the overwhelmingly negative public response. Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman also apologized, saying, &quot;we didn&#x27;t mean for it to be bad. I swear, nobody was like, &#x27;This will be bad.&#x27;&quot; and elaborating that the film was initially intended to be darker in tone.
Retrospectively, George Clooney has spoken critically of and apologized for his involvement in the film, saying in 2005, &quot;I think we might have killed the franchise&quot;, and calling it &quot;a waste of money&quot;. In 2015, while promoting Disney&#x27;s &quot;Tomorrowland&quot; at New York Comic Con, Clooney said that he had met former Batman actor Adam West and apologized to him for the film. Furthermore, when asked during a 2015 interview on &quot;The Graham Norton Show&quot; about whether he had ever had to apologize for &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;, Clooney responded, &quot;I always apologize for &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;&quot;. In late 2020, he told Howard Stern that it was &quot;physically&quot; painful to watch his work in the role: &quot;The truth of the matter is, I was bad in it. Akiva Goldsman — who&#x27;s won the Oscar for writing since then — he wrote the screenplay. And it&#x27;s a terrible screenplay, he&#x27;ll tell you. I&#x27;m terrible in it, I&#x27;ll tell you. Joel Schumacher, who just passed away, directed it, and he&#x27;d say, &#x27;Yeah, it didn&#x27;t work.&#x27; We all whiffed on that one.&quot; Conversely, in an interview with &quot;Empire&quot; in 2012, Arnold Schwarzenegger stated that, despite its poor reception, he did not regret making the film, commenting about his role as Mr. Freeze and his involvement with the studio, &quot;I felt that the character was interesting and two movies before that one Joel Schumacher was at his height. So the decision-making process was not off. At the same time I was doing &quot;Eraser&quot; over there and Warner Bros. begged me to do the movie.&quot; Similarly, 25 years after its theatrical release, Uma Thurman described her work on the film as a &quot;fantastic experience&quot;.

The nipples seen on the character&#x27;s costumes, first appearing in &quot;Batman Forever&quot; and accentuated for &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; at Schumacher&#x27;s request, remain among the most defining aspects of the film. Recounting his involvement with the film, costume designer Jose Fernandez stated that he was opposed to &quot;sharpening&quot; the nipples, calling them &quot;ridiculous&quot;. In 2022, Tim Burton commented about Warner Bros.&#x27; decision to replace him as director with Schumacher after &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, &quot;You complain about me, I&#x27;m too weird, I&#x27;m too dark, and then you put nipples on the costume? Go fuck yourself.&quot; George Clooney&#x27;s screen-worn suit was put up for auction by Heritage Auctions in 2022 with a starting bid of $40,000. A previous owner had estimated it to be worth $100,000 in 2006 when Clooney was at the height of his career. The suit would go on to sell for $57,500.

In the 2009 film &quot;Watchmen&quot;, director Zack Snyder and comic book artist Dave Gibbons chose to parody the molded muscle and nipple Batsuit design from &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; for the Ozymandias costume. The film is referenced in the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;Legends of the Dark Mite!&quot;, when Bat-Mite briefly uses his powers to transform Batman&#x27;s costume into the same suit shown in Schumacher&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot; films, before declaring it &quot;too icky&quot;. 26 years after the release of &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;, Clooney made a cameo appearance as Bruce Wayne in the 2023 DC Extended Universe superhero film &quot;The Flash&quot;. Clooney was asked to reprise the role when the film was already in post-production, agreeing to join after seeing a cut of the film; filming took place in secret six months before release and lasted half a day.

===Accolades===

==Canceled sequel==

During the filming of &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;, Warner Bros. was impressed with the dailies, prompting them to immediately hire Joel Schumacher to return as director for a fifth film. However, writer Akiva Goldsman turned down an offer to write the script. In late 1996, Warner Bros. and Schumacher hired Mark Protosevich to write the script for a fifth &quot;Batman&quot; film. A projected mid-1999 release date was announced. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described their film as &quot;continuing in the same vein with multiple villains and more silliness&quot;. Titled &quot;Batman Unchained&quot;, Protosevich&#x27;s script featured the Scarecrow as the main villain, who, through the use of his fear toxin, resurrects the Joker as a hallucination in Batman&#x27;s mind. Harley Quinn would appear as a supporting character, written as the Joker&#x27;s daughter. Schumacher approached Nicolas Cage to portray the Scarecrow while he was filming &quot;Face/Off&quot; and Courtney Love was considered for Harley Quinn.

Clooney, O&#x27;Donnell, Silverstone, and Coolio were set to reprise the roles of Batman, Robin, Batgirl, and Scarecrow. It was hoped that the villains from previous films would make cameo appearances in the hallucinations caused by Scarecrow, culminating with Jack Nicholson reprising the role of the Joker. Following the poor critical and financial reception of &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;, Clooney vowed never to reprise his role, and Warner Bros. cancelled any future &quot;Batman&quot; films, including Schumacher&#x27;s planned &quot;Batman Unchained&quot;.

In a 2012 interview with &quot;Access Hollywood&quot;, Chris O&#x27;Donnell claimed that a spin-off centered around the character of Robin was planned, but eventually scrapped due to &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;″s poor commercial performance.

<text>Batman Forever is a 1995 American superhero film based on the DC Comics character Batman by Bob Kane and Bill Finger. It is the third installment of Warner Bros.&#x27; initial &quot;Batman&quot; film series and a sequel to &quot;Batman Returns&quot; (1992). Directed by Joel Schumacher and produced by Tim Burton and Peter MacGregor-Scott, it stars Val Kilmer as Bruce Wayne / Batman, replacing Michael Keaton, alongside Tommy Lee Jones, Jim Carrey, Nicole Kidman, and Chris O&#x27;Donnell. The film follows Batman as he attempts to prevent Two-Face (Jones) and the Riddler (Carrey) from uncovering his secret identity and extracting information from the minds of Gotham City&#x27;s residents, while at the same time navigating his feelings for psychologist Dr. Chase Meridian (Kidman) and adopting orphaned acrobat Dick Grayson (O&#x27;Donnell)—who becomes his partner and best friend, Robin.

Schumacher mostly eschewed the dark, dystopian atmosphere of Burton&#x27;s films by drawing inspiration from the Batman comic books of the Dick Sprang era, as well as the 1960s television series. After Keaton chose not to reprise his role, William Baldwin and Ethan Hawke were considered as a replacement, before Val Kilmer joined the cast.

&quot;Batman Forever&quot; was released on June 16, 1995, to mixed reviews from critics, who praised the visuals, action sequences, soundtrack, but criticized the screenplay and tonal departure from previous two films. The film was a box office success, grossing over $336 million worldwide and becoming the sixth-highest-grossing film of 1995. It was followed by &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; in 1997, with Schumacher returning as the director, O&#x27;Donnell returning as Robin, and George Clooney replacing Kilmer as Batman.

==Plot==

In Gotham City, Batman defuses a hostage situation orchestrated by the criminal Two-Face, formerly district attorney Harvey Dent, who escapes. Flashbacks reveal that Batman failed to prevent Dent&#x27;s disfigurement with acid by mobster Sal Maroni, causing Dent to develop a split personality, make decisions based on the flip of a coin, and swear vengeance against Batman.

Edward Nygma, an eccentric and egotistical researcher at Wayne Enterprises, approaches his employer, Bruce Wayne. Nygma presents an invention that can beam television signals directly into the brain, demanding immediate approval directly from Bruce. Bruce rejects the device, as he is irritated by Nygma and is concerned that the technology could manipulate minds. After killing his abusive supervisor and staging it as a suicide, Nygma resigns and plots revenge against Bruce, sending him riddles. Criminal psychologist Chase Meridian diagnoses Nygma as psychotic.

Bruce attends a circus with Chase. Two-Face hijacks the event and threatens to detonate a bomb unless Batman reveals his identity. The youngest member of the Flying Graysons and acrobat Dick Grayson manages to throw the bomb into a river, but Two-Face kills his family in the process. Bruce invites the now-orphaned Dick to live at Wayne Manor as his ward, where he discovers that Bruce is Batman. Seeking to avenge the death of his family, Dick demands to join Batman in crime-fighting, hoping to kill Two-Face, but Bruce declines in order to help Dick move on instead.

Nygma becomes the Riddler and teams up with Two-Face. They commit a series of robberies to finance Nygma&#x27;s new company and mass-produce his brainwave device dubbed the Box, which steals information from minds and transfers it to Nygma&#x27;s, increasing his intelligence but also slowly causing him to lose his grip on reality. At a party hosted by Nygma, Batman pursues Two-Face and is almost killed until Dick saves him.

Batman visits Chase, who explains that she has fallen in love with Bruce and reveals his secret identity to her. Having discovered Bruce&#x27;s secret through the Box, on Halloween night, Two-Face and the Riddler, destroy the Batcave, shoot Bruce and abduct Chase. As Bruce recovers, he and his butler, Alfred Pennyworth, deduce that Nygma is the Riddler. Bruce finally accepts Dick as his best friend and partner, Robin.

At the Riddler&#x27;s lair, Robin defeats Two-Face but chooses to spare him, allowing Two-Face to capture Robin at gunpoint. The Riddler reveals his final riddle; Chase and Robin, representing the two sides of Batman&#x27;s personality, are trapped in tubes above a deadly drop, and he only has the time to save one. Batman distracts the Riddler with a riddle himself, before destroying the Riddler&#x27;s brainwave receiver with a Batarang, damaging the Riddler&#x27;s mind and enabling Batman to rescue both when he sees the floor is an optical illusion. Two-Face corners them and flips his coin to decide their fate, but Batman throws a handful of identical coins in the air, causing Two-Face to fall to his death.

Committed to Arkham Asylum, Nygma exclaims that he is Batman, having become completely delusional due to his scrambled memories. Bruce resumes his crusade as Batman, with Robin as his partner.

==Production==
===Development===
&quot;Batman Returns&quot; was released in 1992 with financial success and generally favorable reviews from critics, but Warner Bros. was disappointed with its box office run, having made $150 million less than the first film. After &quot;Batman Returns&quot; was deemed too dark and inappropriate for children, with McDonald&#x27;s even recalling their Happy Meal tie-in, Warner Bros. decided that this was the primary cause of the film&#x27;s financial results. After the film&#x27;s release, Warner Bros. was not interested in Tim Burton&#x27;s return as director. Burton noted he was unsure about returning to direct, writing: &quot;I don&#x27;t think Warner Bros. wanted me to direct a third &quot;Batman&quot;. I even said that to them.&quot; Burton and Warner Bros. mutually agreed to part ways, though Burton would stay on as producer. John McTiernan turned down an offer to direct. In June 1993, Joel Schumacher was selected by Warner Bros. while he was filming &quot;The Client&quot;, and with Burton&#x27;s approval.

Lee and Janet Scott-Batchler, a husband-and-wife screenwriting team, were hired to write the script. Warner Bros. had lost a bidding war for their spec script titled &quot;Smoke and Mirrors&quot; to Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Pictures. The project ultimately fell through, and Warner Bros. offered the Batchlers several of their film properties to write. Being familiar with the &quot;Batman&quot; comics from their childhood, the Batchlers chose to work on the next &quot;Batman&quot; film as their next project. In a meeting with Burton, they agreed that &quot;the key element to Batman is his duality. And it&#x27;s not just that Batman is Bruce Wayne.&quot;

Their original script introduced a psychotic Riddler, real name Lyle Heckendorf, with a pet rat accompanying him. A scene cut from the final film included Heckendorf obtaining his costume from a fortune-telling leprechaun at the circus. Instead of NygmaTech, the company would have been named HeckTech. The story elements and much of the dialogue still remained in the finished film, though Schumacher felt it could be &quot;lighte[ne]d down&quot;. Keaton initially approved the selection of Schumacher as director and planned on reprising his role as Batman from the first two films. Schumacher claims he originally had in mind an adaptation of Frank Miller&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and Keaton claimed that he was enthusiastic about the idea. Warner Bros. rejected the idea as they wanted a sequel, not a prequel, though Schumacher was able to include very brief events in Bruce Wayne&#x27;s childhood with some events of the comic &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;. Akiva Goldsman, who worked with Schumacher on &quot;The Client&quot;, was brought in to rewrite the script, deleting the initial idea of bringing in the Scarecrow as a villain with Riddler, and the return of Catwoman. Burton, who now was more interested in directing &quot;Ed Wood&quot;, later reflected he was taken aback by some of the focus group meetings for &quot;Batman Forever&quot;, a title he hated. Producer Peter MacGregor-Scott represented the studio&#x27;s aim in making a film for the MTV Generation, with full merchandising appeal.

=== Casting ===
Production went on fast track with Rene Russo cast as Chase Meridian, but Keaton decided not to reprise Batman because he did not like the direction the series was headed in, and rejected the script. Keaton also wanted to pursue &quot;more interesting roles&quot;, turning down $15 million. A decision was made to go with a younger actor for Bruce Wayne, and an offer was made to Ethan Hawke, who turned it down, but eventually regretted the decision; he would eventually voice the character in the preschool animated series &quot;Batwheels&quot; in 2022. Schumacher had seen Val Kilmer in &quot;Tombstone&quot;, but was also interested in William Baldwin, Ralph Fiennes (who would later voice Alfred Pennyworth in &quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot; in 2017), and Daniel Day-Lewis. While Burton pushed for Johnny Depp to get the role, Kurt Russell was also considered. Kilmer, who as a child visited the studios where the 1960s series was recorded, and shortly before had visited a bat cave in Africa, was contacted by his agent for the role. Kilmer signed on without reading the script or knowing who the director was.

With Kilmer&#x27;s casting, Warner Bros. dropped Russo, considering her too old to be paired with Kilmer. Jeanne Tripplehorn and Linda Hamilton were considered for the role, which was eventually recast with Nicole Kidman. Kidman later revealed she took the role because she &quot;wanted to kiss Batman.&quot; Billy Dee Williams took the role of Harvey Dent in &quot;Batman&quot; on the possibility of portraying Two-Face in a sequel, but Schumacher cast Tommy Lee Jones in the role, although Al Pacino, Clint Eastwood, Martin Sheen and Robert De Niro were considered, after working with him on &quot;The Client&quot;. Jones was reluctant to accept the role, but did so at his son&#x27;s insistence.

Robin Williams was in discussions to be the Riddler at one point, and was reportedly in competition for the role with John Malkovich. In June 1994, the role was given to Jim Carrey after Williams had reportedly turned it down. In a 2003 interview, Schumacher stated Michael Jackson had lobbied hard for the role, but was turned down before Carrey was cast. Brad Dourif (who was Burton&#x27;s original choice to portray the Joker and Scarecrow after), Kelsey Grammer, Micky Dolenz, Matthew Broderick, Phil Hartman and Steve Martin were said to have been considered.

Robin had appeared in the shooting script for &quot;Batman Returns&quot; but was deleted due to having too many characters. Marlon Wayans had been cast in the role and signed on for a potential sequel, but when Schumacher took over, he decided to open up casting to other actors. Leonardo DiCaprio was considered, but decided not to pursue the role after a meeting with Schumacher. Matt Damon, Corey Haim, Corey Feldman, Mark Wahlberg, Michael Worth, Danny Dyer, Toby Stephens, Ewan McGregor, Jude Law, Alan Cumming and Scott Speedman were considered. Chris O&#x27;Donnell was cast and Mitch Gaylord served as his stunt double, and also portrayed Mitch Grayson, Dick&#x27;s older brother, created for the film. Schumacher attempted to create a cameo role for Bono as his MacPhisto character, but both came to agree it was not suitable for the film.

===Filming===
Principal photography began on September 24, 1994, and wrapped on March 5, 1995. Schumacher hired Barbara Ling for production design, claiming that the film needed a &quot;force&quot; and good design. Ling could &quot;advance on it&quot;. Schumacher wanted a design in no way connected to the previous films, and instead inspired by the images from the &quot;Batman&quot; comic books seen in the 1940s/early 1950s and New York City architecture in the 1930s, with a combination of modern Tokyo. He also wanted a &quot;city with personality,&quot; with more statues, as well as various amounts of neon.

===Difficulties and clashes===
Schumacher and Kilmer clashed during the making of the film; Schumacher described Kilmer as &quot;childish and impossible,&quot; reporting that he fought with various crewmen, and refused to speak to Schumacher for two weeks after the director told him to stop being rude. Schumacher also mentioned Tommy Lee Jones as a source of trouble: &quot;Jim Carrey was a gentleman, and Tommy Lee was threatened by him. I&#x27;m tired of defending overpaid, overprivileged actors. I pray I don&#x27;t work with them again.&quot; In a 2014 interview, Carrey acknowledged that Jones was not friendly to him, and recounted an incident wherein Jones found him off-set during the production, and told him: &quot;I hate you. I really don&#x27;t like you ... I cannot sanction your buffoonery.&quot;

===Design and visual effects===
Rick Baker designed the prosthetic makeup. John Dykstra, Andrew Adamson and Jim Rygiel served as visual effects supervisors, with Rhythm &amp; Hues Studios (R&amp;H) and Pacific Data Images also contributing to visual effects work. R&amp;H and PDI provided a CGI Batman for complicated stunts. For the costume design, producer Peter MacGregor-Scott claimed that 146 workers were at one point working together. Batman&#x27;s costume was redesigned along the lines of a more &quot;MTV organic, and edgier feel&quot; to the suit. Sound design and mixing was created and supervised by Bruce Stambler and John Levesque, which included trips to caves to record bat sounds. A new Batmobile was designed for &quot;Batman Forever&quot;, with two cars being constructed, one for stunt purposes and one for close-ups. Chris O&#x27;Donnell had the area around his eyes painted black and then the Robin mask glued on him. Swiss surrealist painter H. R. Giger provided his version for the Batmobile but it was considered too sinister for the film. Nygma&#x27;s brainwave device and lair resemble rejected concept artwork of Columbus Lighthouse by Russian avant-garde architect Konstantin Melnikov from 1929.

The film used some motion capture for certain visual effects. Warner Bros. had acquired motion capture technology from arcade video game company Acclaim Entertainment for use in the film&#x27;s production.

==Music==

Elliot Goldenthal was hired by Schumacher to compose the film score before the screenplay was written. In discussions with Schumacher, the director wanted Goldenthal to avoid taking inspiration from Danny Elfman, and requested an original composition. The film&#x27;s promotional teaser trailer however used the main title theme from Elfman&#x27;s score of 1989&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot;.

The soundtrack was commercially successful, selling almost as many copies as Prince&#x27;s soundtrack to the 1989 &quot;Batman&quot; film. Only five of the songs on the soundtrack are actually featured in the movie. Hit singles from the soundtrack include &quot;Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me&quot; by U2 and &quot;Kiss from a Rose&quot; by Seal, both of which were nominated for MTV Movie Awards. &quot;Kiss from a Rose&quot; (whose music video was also directed by Joel Schumacher) reached No. 1 in the U.S. charts as well. The soundtrack itself, featuring additional songs by The Flaming Lips, Brandy (both songs also included in the film), Method Man, Nick Cave, Michael Hutchence (of INXS), PJ Harvey and Massive Attack, was an attempt to (in producer Peter MacGregor-Scott&#x27;s words) make the film more &quot;pop&quot;.

==Release==
===Marketing===

In addition to a large line of toys, video games and action figures from Kenner, the McDonald&#x27;s food chain released several collectibles and mugs to coincide with the release of the film. Peter David and Alan Grant wrote separate novelizations of the film. Dennis O&#x27;Neil authored a comic book adaptation, with art by Michal Dutkiewicz.

Six Flags Great Adventure theme park re-themed their &quot;Axis Chemical&quot; arena, home of the Batman stunt show, to resemble &quot;Batman Forever&quot;, and the new show featured props from the film. Six Flags Over Texas featured a one-time fireworks show to promote the movie, and replica busts of Batman, Robin, Two-Face, and the Riddler could be found in the Justice League store in the Looney Tunes U.S.A. section until they were removed in 2023. opened at Six Flags St. Louis to promote the movie. At Six Flags Over Georgia, The Mind Bender roller coaster was redesigned to look as though it were the creation of The Riddler and some images and props were used in the design of the roller coaster and its queue.

===Video games===
Video games based on the film were released. A video game of the same name, was released in 1995 for Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Game Boy, Sega Genesis, Game Gear, R-Zone and MS-DOS, it was followed by &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; for the PlayStation, to promote the release of the film. Two arcade versions, &quot;Batman Forever: The Arcade Game&quot;, was released in 1996 and was ported to the three consoles, and a pinball machine based on the film was released in 1995 by Sega Pinball.

=== Home media ===
&quot;Batman Forever&quot; was released on VHS and LaserDisc on October 31, 1995. Over 3 million VHS copies were sold during the first week of release. The film was then released on DVD on May 20, 1997. This release was a double sided disc containing both widescreen (1.85:1) and full screen (1.33:1) versions of the film. &quot;Batman Forever&quot; made its Blu-ray debut on April 20, 2010. This was followed by an Ultra HD Blu-ray release on June 4, 2019.

====Deleted scenes====
&quot;Batman Forever&quot; went through a few major edits before its release. Originally darker than the final product, the film&#x27;s original length was closer to two hours and forty minutes, according to Schumacher. There was talk of an extended cut being released to DVD for the film&#x27;s tenth anniversary in 2005. While all four previous &quot;Batman&quot; films were given special-edition DVD releases on the same day as the &quot;Batman Begins&quot; DVD release, none of them were given extended cuts, although some scenes were in a deleted scenes section in the special features.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Batman Forever&quot; opened in a record 2,842 theaters and 4,300 screens in the United States and Canada on June 16, 1995, grossing $52.8 million in its opening weekend, taking &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;″s record for having the highest opening-weekend gross of all time (it was surpassed two years later by &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot;″s $72.1 million). For six years, it had the largest opening weekend for a Warner Bros. film until 2001, when it was surpassed by &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#x27;s Stone&quot;. The film also achieved the highest June opening weekend, holding that record until it was beaten by &quot;Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot; in 1999, which would then be overtaken by &quot;Hulk&quot; in 2003. It was the first film to gross $20 million in one day, on its opening day on Friday. The film also beat out &quot;Congo&quot; to reach the number one spot. It grossed $77.4 million in its first week, which was below the record $81.7 million set by &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;.

Additionally, the film held the record for having the highest opening weekend for a superhero film until it was taken by &quot;X-Men&quot; in 2000. That year, &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot; broke &quot;Batman Forever&quot;″s record for scoring the biggest opening weekend for any film starring Jim Carrey. While the film was overtaken by &quot;Pocahontas&quot; during its second weekend, it still made $29.2 million. It then became the first film of 1995 to reach $100 million domestically. The film started its international roll out in Japan on June 17, 1995, and grossed $2.2 million in 5 days from 167 screens, which was only 80% of the gross of its predecessor &quot;Batman Returns&quot;.

The film went on to gross $184 million in the United States and Canada, and $152.5 million in other countries, totaling $336.53 million. The film grossed more than &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, and is the second-highest-grossing film from 1995 in the United States, behind &quot;Toy Story&quot;, as well as the sixth-highest-grossing film of that year worldwide.

===Critical response===

On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Batman Forever&quot; has an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average rating of 5.1/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Loud, excessively busy, and often boring, &quot;Batman Forever&quot; nonetheless has the charisma of Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones to offer mild relief.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 51 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;Batman Forever&quot; still gets in its licks. There&#x27;s no fun machine this summer that packs more surprises.&quot; Travers criticized the film&#x27;s excessive commercialism and felt that &quot;the script misses the pain Tim Burton caught in a man tormented by the long-ago murder of his parents&quot;, but praised Kilmer&#x27;s performance as having a &quot;deftly understated [...] comic edge&quot;. James Berardinelli of &quot;ReelViews&quot; enjoyed the film, writing: &quot;It&#x27;s lighter, brighter, funnier, faster-paced, and a whole lot more colorful than before.&quot;

On the television program &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert&quot;, Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; both gave the film mixed reviews, but with the former giving it a thumbs up and the latter a thumbs down. In his written review, Ebert wrote: &quot;Is the movie better entertainment? Well, it&#x27;s great bubblegum for the eyes. Younger children will be able to process it more easily; some kids were led bawling from &quot;Batman Returns&quot; where the PG-13 rating was a joke.&quot;

Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; had a mixed reaction, concluding: &quot;a shot of Kilmer&#x27;s rubber buns at one point is guaranteed to bring squeals from the audience.&quot; Brian Lowry of &quot;Variety&quot; believed: &quot;One does have to question the logic behind adding nipples to the hard-rubber batsuit. Whose idea was that supposed to be anyway, Alfred&#x27;s? Some of the computer-generated Gotham cityscapes appear too obviously fake. Elliot Goldenthal&#x27;s score, while serviceable, also isn&#x27;t as stirring as Danny Elfman&#x27;s work in the first two films.&quot;

Some observers thought Schumacher, a gay man, added possible homoerotic innuendo in the storyline. Regarding the costume design, Schumacher stated: &quot;I had no idea that putting nipples on the Batsuit and Robin suit were going to spark international headlines. The bodies of the suits come from Ancient Greek statues, which display perfect bodies. They are anatomically correct.&quot; O&#x27;Donnell felt: &quot;it wasn&#x27;t so much the nipples that bothered me. It was the codpiece. The press obviously played it up and made it a big deal, especially with Joel directing. I didn&#x27;t think twice about the controversy, but going back and looking and seeing some of the pictures, it was very unusual.&quot;

===Accolades===

At the 68th Academy Awards, &quot;Batman Forever&quot; was nominated for Cinematography (lost to &quot;Braveheart&quot;), Sound (Donald O. Mitchell, Frank A. Montaño, Michael Herbick and Petur Hliddal; lost to &quot;Apollo 13&quot;) and Sound Effects Editing (John Leveque and Bruce Stambler; also lost to &quot;Braveheart&quot;).

&quot;Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me&quot; by U2 was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song (lost to &quot;Colors of the Wind&quot; from &quot;Pocahontas&quot;), but was also nominated for the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Original Song (lost to &quot;Walk into the Wind&quot; from &quot;Showgirls&quot;).

At the 22nd Saturn Awards, the film was nominated for Best Fantasy Film (lost to &quot;Babe&quot;), Make-up (lost to &quot;Seven&quot;), Special Effects (lost to &quot;Jumanji&quot;) and Costume Design (lost to &quot;12 Monkeys&quot;).

Composer Elliot Goldenthal was given a Grammy Award nomination.

&quot;Batman Forever&quot; received six nominations at the 1996 MTV Movie Awards, four of which were divided between two categories (Carrey and Lee Jones for Best Villain; and Seal&#x27;s &quot;Kiss from a Rose&quot; and U2&#x27;s &quot;Hold Me&quot; in Best Song from a Movie). However, it won in just one category: Best Song from a Movie for Seal&#x27;s &quot;Kiss from a Rose&quot;.

==Legacy==
===Potential director&#x27;s cut===
Cuts were made to the film based on audience reactions during test screenings, like the rest of the &quot;Batman&quot; films. Photographs from these scenes have always been available since the film&#x27;s release, shown in magazines such as &quot;Starlog&quot;. Some excerpts from these scenes appear in the music video for &quot;Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me&quot;. In 2005, &quot;Batman Forever&quot; was the only film in the franchise to include a dedicated deleted scenes selection among its bonus content on the special edition DVD.

After Joel Schumacher died on June 22, 2020, media outlets started reporting the possible existence of an extended cut, with the first rumors being thrown in by American journalist Marc Bernardin. Bernardin claimed it to be darker and contain less camp than the theatrical cut. Some of the differences include Bruce having a vision of a human-sized bat, less of an emphasis on Dick Grayson, and a focus on Bruce&#x27;s psychological issues with Chase. The cut uses about 50 minutes of additional footage. Warner Bros. confirmed that alternative test screening cuts existed after an interview with &quot;Variety&quot;, although they have no plans to release it and are unsure about what, if any, footage remains. Later that year on August 7, Kilmer&#x27;s appearance at DC FanDome fueled fan speculation about the release of a so-called &quot;Schumacher Cut&quot;. &quot;Batman Forever&quot; screenwriter Akiva Goldsman revealed in a YouTube interview in April 2021 that he had recently seen the original cut of the film (dubbed &quot;Preview Cut: One&quot;) and that he expects a rebirth coming up, suggesting all the footage needed to make the Schumacher cut still exists and that the release of a director&#x27;s cut might be possible.

In July 2023, following a private screening of a workprint version by director Kevin Smith, Goldsman confirmed that the original cut does exist and even though Warner Bros. currently has no plans to release it, he said he was hopeful for a possible distribution in the future. Some of the aforementioned deleted scenes make up a portion of this footage.

In July 2024, Goldsman reaffirmed the existence of the director&#x27;s cut, while also declaring that work to restore it has been put on stall following Warner Bros. recent internal turmoils.

===&quot;Batman &#x27;89&quot;===

An alternate six-issue comic book continuation of &quot;Batman Returns&quot; titled &quot;Batman &#x27;89&quot;, which ignores the events of &quot;Batman Forever&quot; and &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; and brings back Keaton&#x27;s Batman along with Burton&#x27;s dark setting seen in his first two Batman films, along with elements of his failed third &quot;Batman&quot; film (particularly, the return of Billy Dee Williams&#x27; Harvey Dent and transformation into Two-Face, the introductions of new versions of Robin and Barbara Gordon, and the return of Catwoman), was launched on August 10, 2021, with its issues releasing monthly before ending in January 2022.

In response to a question as to whether Schumacher&#x27;s Batman films are canon to the world of &quot;Batman &#x27;89&quot;, the first two films&#x27; screenwriter Sam Hamm, who also serves as the comics&#x27; writer, confirmed that the latter two films take place in a diverging timeline and they are not building toward that fate.

<text>A bidirectional text contains two text directionalities, right-to-left (RTL) and left-to-right (LTR). It generally involves text containing different types of alphabets, but may also refer to boustrophedon, which is changing text direction in each row.

An example is the RTL Hebrew name Sarah: , spelled sin (ש) on the right, resh (ר) in the middle, and heh (ה) on the left. Many computer program failed to display this correctly, because they were designed to display text in one direction only.

Some so-called right-to-left scripts such as the Persian script and Arabic are mostly, but not exclusively, right-to-left—mathematical expressions, numeric dates and numbers bearing units are embedded from left to right. That also happens if text from a left-to-right language such as English is embedded in them; or vice versa, if Arabic is embedded in a left-to-right script such as English.

== Bidirectional script support ==

Bidirectional script support is the capability of a computer system to correctly display bidirectional text. The term is often shortened to &quot;BiDi&quot; or &quot;bidi&quot;.

Early computer installations were designed only to support a single writing system, typically for left-to-right scripts based on the Latin alphabet only. Adding new character sets and character encodings enabled a number of other left-to-right scripts to be supported, but did not easily support right-to-left scripts such as Arabic or Hebrew, and mixing the two was not practical. Right-to-left scripts were introduced through encodings like ISO/IEC 8859-6 and ISO/IEC 8859-8, storing the letters (usually) in writing and reading order. It is possible to simply flip the left-to-right display order to a right-to-left display order, but doing this sacrifices the ability to correctly display left-to-right scripts. With bidirectional script support, it is possible to mix characters from different scripts on the same page, regardless of writing direction.

In particular, the Unicode standard provides foundations for complete BiDi support, with detailed rules as to how mixtures of left-to-right and right-to-left scripts are to be encoded and displayed.

== Unicode bidi support ==

The Unicode standard calls for characters to be ordered &#x27;logically&#x27;, i.e. in the sequence they are intended to be interpreted, as opposed to &#x27;visually&#x27;, the sequence they appear. This distinction is relevant for bidi support because at any bidi transition, the visual presentation ceases to be the &#x27;logical&#x27; one. Thus, in order to offer bidi support, Unicode prescribes an algorithm for how to convert the logical sequence of characters into the correct visual presentation. For this purpose, the Unicode encoding standard divides all its characters into one of four types: &#x27;strong&#x27;, &#x27;weak&#x27;, &#x27;neutral&#x27;, and &#x27;explicit formatting&#x27;.

=== Strong characters ===
Strong characters are those with a definite direction. Examples of this type of character include most alphabetic characters, syllabic characters, Han ideographs, non-European or non-Arabic digits, and punctuation characters that are specific to only those scripts.

=== Weak characters ===
Weak characters are those with vague direction. Examples of this type of character include European digits, Eastern Arabic-Indic digits, arithmetic symbols, and currency symbols.

=== Neutral characters ===
Neutral characters have direction indeterminable without context. Examples include paragraph separators, tabs, and most other whitespace characters. Punctuation symbols that are common to many scripts, such as the colon, comma, full-stop, and the no-break-space also fall within this category.

=== Explicit formatting ===
Explicit formatting characters, also referred to as &quot;directional formatting characters&quot;, are special Unicode sequences that direct the algorithm to modify its default behavior. These characters are subdivided into &quot;marks&quot;, &quot;embeddings&quot;, &quot;isolates&quot;, and &quot;overrides&quot;. Their effects continue until the occurrence of either a paragraph separator, or a &quot;pop&quot; character.

==== Marks ====

If a &quot;weak&quot; character is followed by another &quot;weak&quot; character, the algorithm will look at the first neighbouring &quot;strong&quot; character. Sometimes this leads to unintentional display errors. These errors are corrected or prevented with &quot;pseudo-strong&quot; characters. Such Unicode control characters are called &quot;marks&quot;. The mark ( or ) is to be inserted into a location to make an enclosed weak character inherit its writing direction.

For example, to correctly display the for an English name brand (LTR) in an Arabic (RTL) passage, an LRM mark is inserted after the trademark symbol if the symbol is not followed by LTR text (e.g. &quot;). If the LRM mark is not added, the weak character ™ will be neighbored by a strong LTR character and a strong RTL character. Hence, in an RTL context, it will be considered to be RTL, and displayed in an incorrect order (e.g. &quot;).

==== Embeddings ====
The &quot;embedding&quot; directional formatting characters are the classical Unicode method of explicit formatting, and as of Unicode 6.3, are being discouraged in favor of &quot;isolates&quot;. An &quot;embedding&quot; signals that a piece of text is to be treated as directionally distinct. The text within the scope of the embedding formatting characters is not independent of the surrounding text. Also, characters within an embedding can affect the ordering of characters outside. Unicode 6.3 recognized that directional embeddings usually have too strong an effect on their surroundings and are thus unnecessarily difficult to use.

==== Isolates ====
The &quot;isolate&quot; directional formatting characters signal that a piece of text is to be treated as directionally isolated from its surroundings. As of Unicode 6.3, these are the formatting characters that are being encouraged in new documents – once target platforms are known to support them. These formatting characters were introduced after it became apparent that directional embeddings usually have too strong an effect on their surroundings and are thus unnecessarily difficult to use. Unlike the legacy &#x27;embedding&#x27; directional formatting characters, &#x27;isolate&#x27; characters have no effect on the ordering of the text outside their scope. Isolates can be nested, and may be placed within embeddings and overrides.

==== Overrides ====
The &quot;override&quot; directional formatting characters allow for special cases, such as for part numbers (e.g. to force a part number made of mixed English, digits and Hebrew letters to be written from right to left), and are recommended to be avoided wherever possible. As is true of the other directional formatting characters, &quot;overrides&quot; can be nested one inside another, and in embeddings and isolates.

===== Using Unicode to override =====
Using will switch the text direction from left-to-right to right-to-left. Similarly, using will switch the text direction from right-to-left to left-to-right. Refer to the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm.

==== Pops ====
The &quot;pop&quot; directional formatting character, encoded at , terminates the scope of the most recent &quot;embedding&quot;, &quot;override&quot;, or &quot;isolate&quot;.

=== Runs ===
In the algorithm, each sequence of concatenated strong characters is called a &quot;run&quot;. A &quot;weak&quot; character that is located between two &quot;strong&quot; characters with the same orientation will inherit their orientation. A &quot;weak&quot; character that is located between two &quot;strong&quot; characters with a different writing direction will inherit the main context&#x27;s writing direction (in an LTR document the character will become LTR, in an RTL document, it will become RTL).

=== Table of possible BiDi character types ===
=== Security ===
Unicode bidirectional characters are used in the Trojan Source vulnerability.

Visual Studio Code highlights BiDi control characters since version 1.62 released in October 2021.

Visual Studio highlights BiDi control characters since version 17.0.3 released on December 14, 2021.

== Scripts using bidirectional text ==

=== Egyptian hieroglyphs ===
Egyptian hieroglyphs were written bidirectionally, where the signs that had a distinct &quot;head&quot; or &quot;tail&quot; faced the beginning of the line.

=== Chinese characters and other CJK scripts ===
Chinese characters can be written in either direction as well as vertically (top to bottom then right to left), especially in signs (such as plaques), but the orientation of the individual characters does not change. This can often be seen on tour buses in China, where the company name customarily runs from the front of the vehicle to its rear — that is, from right to left on the right side of the bus, and from left to right on the left side of the bus. English texts on the right side of the vehicle are also quite commonly written in reverse order. (See pictures of tour bus and post vehicle below.)

Likewise, other CJK scripts made up of the same square characters, such as the Japanese writing system and Korean writing system, can also be written in any direction, although horizontally left-to-right, top-to-bottom and vertically top-to-bottom right-to-left are the two most common forms.
=== Boustrophedon ===
Boustrophedon is a writing style found in ancient Greek inscriptions, in Old Sabaic (an Old South Arabian language) and in Hungarian runes. This method of writing alternates direction, and usually reverses the individual characters, on each successive line.

===Moon type===
Moon type is an embossed adaptation of the Latin alphabet invented as a tactile alphabet for the blind.
Initially the text changed direction (but not character orientation) at the end of the lines.
Special embossed lines connected the end of a line and the beginning of the next.
Around 1990, it changed to a left-to-right orientation.

<text>In mathematics, Bernoulli&#x27;s inequality (named after Jacob Bernoulli) is an inequality that approximates exponentiations of formula_1. It is often employed in real analysis. It has several useful variants:

== Integer exponent ==
* Case 1: formula_2 for every integer formula_3 and real number formula_4. The inequality is strict if formula_5 and formula_6.
* Case 2: formula_2 for every integer formula_8 and every real number formula_9.
* Case 3: formula_2 for every even integer formula_8 and every real number formula_12.

== Real exponent ==
* formula_2 for every real number formula_3 and formula_15. The inequality is strict if formula_5 and formula_17.
* formula_18 for every real number formula_19 and formula_15.

==History==
Jacob Bernoulli first published the inequality in his treatise &quot;Positiones Arithmeticae de Seriebus Infinitis&quot; (Basel, 1689), where he used the inequality often.

According to Joseph E. Hofmann, Über die Exercitatio Geometrica des M. A. Ricci (1963), p. 177, the inequality is actually due to Sluse in his Mesolabum (1668 edition), Chapter IV &quot;De maximis &amp; minimis&quot;.

==Proof for integer exponent==

The first case has a simple inductive proof:

Suppose the statement is true for formula_21:

:formula_22

Then it follows that

:formula_23

Bernoulli&#x27;s inequality can be proved for case 2, in which formula_24 is a non-negative integer and formula_25, using mathematical induction in the following form:
* we prove the inequality for formula_26,
* from validity for some &quot;r&quot; we deduce validity for formula_27.

For formula_28,

:formula_29

is equivalent to formula_30 which is true.

Similarly, for formula_31 we have

:formula_32

Now suppose the statement is true for formula_21:

:formula_22

Then it follows that

:formula_35

since formula_36 as well as formula_37. By the modified induction we conclude the statement is true for every non-negative integer formula_24.

By noting that if formula_39, then formula_40 is negative gives case 3.

==Generalizations==

=== Generalization of exponent ===
The exponent formula_24 can be generalized to an arbitrary real number as follows: if formula_42, then

:formula_2

for formula_44 or formula_45, and

:formula_18

for formula_19.

This generalization can be proved by comparing derivatives. The strict versions of these inequalities require formula_5 and formula_49.

=== Generalization of base ===
Instead of formula_50 the inequality holds also in the form formula_51 where formula_52 are real numbers, all greater than formula_53, all with the same sign. Bernoulli&#x27;s inequality is a special case when formula_54. This generalized inequality can be proved by mathematical induction.
In the first step we take formula_55. In this case the inequality formula_56 is obviously true.

In the second step we assume validity of the inequality for formula_24 numbers and deduce validity for formula_58 numbers.

We assume thatformula_59is valid. After multiplying both sides with a positive number formula_60 we get:

formula_61

As formula_62 all have the same sign, the products formula_63 are all positive numbers. So the quantity on the right-hand side can be bounded as follows:formula_64what was to be shown.
=== Strengthened version ===
The following theorem presents a strengthened version of the Bernoulli inequality, incorporating additional terms to refine the estimate under specific conditions. Let the expoent formula_24 be a nonnegative integer and let formula_12 be a real number with formula_67 if formula_24 is odd and greater than 1. Then

formula_69 

with equality if and only if formula_70 or formula_71. 

== Related inequalities ==
The following inequality estimates the formula_24-th power of formula_1 from the other side. For any real numbers formula_12 and formula_24 with formula_76, one has

:formula_77

where formula_78 2.718.... This may be proved using the inequality

:formula_79

==Alternative form==
An alternative form of Bernoulli&#x27;s inequality for formula_80 and formula_81 is:

:formula_82

This can be proved (for any integer formula_83) by using the formula for geometric series: (using formula_84)

:formula_85
or equivalently formula_86

==Alternative proofs==
===Arithmetic and geometric means===
An elementary proof for formula_87 and formula_88 can be given using weighted AM-GM.

Let formula_89 be two non-negative real constants. By weighted AM-GM on formula_90 with weights formula_89 respectively, we get

:formula_92

Note that

:formula_93

and

:formula_94

so our inequality is equivalent to

:formula_95

After substituting formula_96 (bearing in mind that this implies formula_87) our inequality turns into

:formula_98

which is Bernoulli&#x27;s inequality.

===Geometric series===
Bernoulli&#x27;s inequality

is equivalent to
and by the formula for geometric series (using &quot;y&quot; = 1 + &quot;x&quot;) we get
which leads to
Now if formula_99 then by monotony of the powers each summand formula_100, and therefore their sum is greater formula_101 and hence the product on the LHS of ().

If formula_102 then by the same arguments formula_103 and thus
all addends formula_104 are non-positive and hence so is their sum. Since the product of two non-positive numbers is non-negative, we get again

===Binomial theorem===
One can prove Bernoulli&#x27;s inequality for &quot;x&quot; ≥ 0 using the binomial theorem. It is true trivially for &quot;r&quot; = 0, so suppose &quot;r&quot; is a positive integer. Then formula_105 Clearly formula_106 and hence formula_107 as required.

===Using convexity===
For formula_108 the function formula_109 is strictly convex. Therefore, for formula_110 holds
formula_111
and the reversed inequality is valid for formula_112 and formula_113.

Another way of using convexity is to re-cast the desired inequality to formula_114 for real formula_3 and real formula_116. This inequality can be proved using the fact that the formula_117 function is concave, and then using Jensen&#x27;s inequality in the form formula_118 to give:
formula_119 
which is the desired inequality.

<text>The &quot;Benjamin Franklin&quot; class of US ballistic missile submarines were in service from the 1960s–2000s. The class was an evolutionary development from the earlier of fleet ballistic missile submarine. Having quieter machinery and other improvements, it is considered a separate class. A subset of this class is the re-engineered 640 class starting with . The primary difference was that they were built under the new SUBSAFE rules after the loss of , earlier boats of the class had to be retrofitted to meet SUBSAFE requirements. The &quot;Benjamin Franklin&quot; class, together with the , , , and &quot;James Madison&quot; classes, comprised the &quot;41 for Freedom&quot; that was the Navy&#x27;s primary contribution to the nuclear deterrent force through the late 1980s. This class and the &quot;James Madison&quot; class are combined with the &quot;Lafayette&quot;s in some references.

==Design==

The &quot;Benjamin Franklin&quot;-class submarines were built with the Polaris A-3 ballistic missile, and in the early 1970s were converted to carry the Poseidon C-3 missile. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, six boats were further modified to carry the Trident I (C-4) missile, along with six &quot;James Madison&quot;-class boats. These were &quot;Benjamin Franklin&quot;, &quot;Simon Bolivar&quot;, &quot;George Bancroft&quot;, &quot;Henry L. Stimson&quot;, &quot;Francis Scott Key&quot;, and &quot;Mariano G. Vallejo&quot;.

Due to the loss of in April 1963, this class was designed to SUBSAFE standards and its equipment was similar to the fast attack submarines (SSNs). Previous US SSBNs except the &quot;George Washington&quot; class had equipment similar to the SSNs.

This class can be distinguished by the fairwater planes&#x27; location halfway up the sail; the &quot;Lafayette&quot;s and &quot;James Madison&quot;s had the fairwater planes in the upper front portion of the sail.

Two submarines of this class were converted for delivery of up to 66 SEALs or other Special Operations Forces each. In the early 1990s, to make room for the ballistic missile submarines within the limits set by the SALT II strategic arms limitation treaty, the ballistic missile tubes of and were disabled. Those boats were redesignated special operations attack submarines and given attack submarine (SSN) hull classification symbols. They were equipped with dry deck shelters to accommodate SEAL Delivery Vehicles or other equipment.

==Fate==
The &quot;Benjamin Franklin&quot;s were decommissioned between 1992 and 2002 due to a combination of SALT II treaty limitations as the SSBNs entered service, age, and the collapse of the Soviet Union. USS &quot;Kamehameha&quot; was decommissioned on 2 April 2002, the last ship of the &quot;Benjamin Franklin&quot; class to be decommissioned.

The sail of &quot;George Bancroft&quot; is preserved at the Naval Submarine Base King&#x27;s Bay, Georgia. &quot;James K. Polk&quot;″s sail is on display at the National Museum of Nuclear Science &amp; History in Albuquerque, New Mexico. &quot;Mariano G. Vallejo&quot;″s sail is preserved at Mare Island, California, where she was built. The sail of &quot;Lewis and Clark&quot; is on display at the Patriot&#x27;s Point Maritime Museum in Charleston, South Carolina.

<text>The Bastard Operator From Hell (BOFH) is a fictional rogue computer operator created by Simon Travaglia, who takes out his anger on users (who are &quot;lusers&quot; to him) and others who pester him with their computer problems, uses his expertise against his enemies and manipulates his employer.

Several people have written stories about BOFHs, but only those by Simon Travaglia are considered canonical. 
The BOFH stories were originally posted in 1992 to Usenet by Travaglia, with some being reprinted in &quot;Datamation.&quot; Since 2000 they have been published regularly in &quot;The Register&quot; (UK). Several collections of the stories have been published as books.

By extension, the term is also used to refer to any system administrator who displays the qualities of the original.

The early accounts of the BOFH took place in a university; later the scenes were set in an office workplace. In 2000 (BOFH 2k), the BOFH and his pimply-faced youth (PFY) assistant moved to a new company.

== Other characters ==
* The PFY (Pimply-Faced Youth, the assistant to the BOFH. Real name is Stephen) Possesses a temperament similar to the BOFH, and often either teams up with or plots against him.
* The Boss (often portrayed as having no IT knowledge but believing otherwise; identity changes as successive bosses are sacked, leave, are committed, or have nasty &quot;accidents&quot;)
* CEO of the company – The PFY&#x27;s uncle Brian from 1996 until 2000, when the BOFH and PFY moved to a new company.
* The help desk operators, referred to as the &quot;Helldesk&quot; and often scolded for giving out the BOFH&#x27;s personal number.
* The Boss&#x27;s secretary, Sharon.
* The security department
* George, the cleaner (an invaluable source of information to the BOFH and PFY)

== Books ==
* 
* 

== Influence ==

The protagonist in Charles Stross&#x27;s &quot;The Laundry Files&quot; series of novels named himself Bob Oliver Francis Howard in reference to the BOFH. As Bob Howard is a self-chosen pseudonym, and Bob is a network manager when not working as a computational demonologist, the name is all too appropriate. In the novella &quot;Pimpf&quot;, he acquires a pimply-faced young assistant by the name of Peter-Fred Young.

BOFH is a text adventure game written by Howard A. Sherman, which took part in the 2002 Interactive Fiction Competition and was placed 26th out of 38.

==Simon Travaglia==

Simon Travaglia (born 1964) graduated from the University of Waikato, New Zealand in 1985. He worked as the IT infrastructure manager (2004–2008) and computer operator (1985–1992) at the University of Waikato and the infrastructure manager at the Waikato Innovation Park, Hamilton, New Zealand (since 2008). Since 1999 he is a freelance writer for &quot;The Register&quot;. He lives in Hautapu, New Zealand.

<text>Walter Brown &quot;Brownie&quot; McGhee (November 30, 1915 – February 16, 1996) was an American folk and Piedmont blues singer and guitarist, best known for his collaboration with the harmonica player Sonny Terry.

==Life and career==
McGhee was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, and grew up in Kingsport, Tennessee. At about the age of four he contracted polio, which incapacitated his right leg. His brother Granville &quot;Stick&quot; McGhee, who also later became a musician and composed the song &quot;Drinkin&#x27; Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee&quot;, was nicknamed for pushing young Brownie around in a cart. Their father, George McGhee, was a factory worker, known around University Avenue for playing guitar and singing. Brownie&#x27;s uncle made him a guitar from a tin marshmallow box and a piece of board.

McGhee spent much of his youth immersed in music, singing with a local harmony group, the Golden Voices Gospel Quartet, and teaching himself to play guitar. He also played the five-string banjo and ukulele and studied piano. Surgery funded by the March of Dimes enabled McGhee to walk.

At the age of 22, McGhee became a traveling musician, working in the Rabbit Foot Minstrels and befriending Blind Boy Fuller, whose guitar playing influenced him greatly. After Fuller&#x27;s death in 1941, J. B. Long of Columbia Records promoted McGhee as &quot;Blind Boy Fuller No. 2&quot;. By that time, McGhee was recording for Columbia&#x27;s subsidiary Okeh Records in Chicago, but his real success came after he moved to New York in 1942, when he teamed up with Sonny Terry, whom he had known since 1939, when Terry was Fuller&#x27;s harmonica player. The pairing was an overnight success. They recorded and toured together until around 1980. As a duo, Terry and McGhee did most of their work from 1958 until 1980, spending 11 months of each year touring and recording dozens of albums.

Despite their later fame as &quot;pure&quot; folk artists playing for white audiences, in the 1940s Terry and McGhee had attempted to be successful recording artists, fronting a jump blues combo with honking saxophone and rolling piano, variously calling themselves &quot;Brownie McGhee and his Jook House Rockers&quot; or &quot;Sonny Terry and his Buckshot Five&quot;, often with Champion Jack Dupree and Big Chief Ellis. They also appeared in the original Broadway productions of &quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; and &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot;.

During the blues revival of the 1960s, Terry and McGhee were popular on the concert and music festival circuits, occasionally adding new material but usually remaining faithful to their roots and playing to the tastes of their audiences.

Late in his life, McGhee appeared in small roles in films and on television. He and Terry appeared in the 1979 Steve Martin comedy &quot;The Jerk&quot;. In 1987, McGhee gave a small but memorable performance as the ill-fated blues singer Toots Sweet in the supernatural thriller movie &quot;Angel Heart.&quot; In his review of &quot;Angel Heart&quot;, the critic Roger Ebert singled out McGhee for praise, declaring that he delivered a &quot;performance that proves [saxophonist] Dexter Gordon isn&#x27;t the only old musician who can act.&quot; McGhee appeared in the television series &quot;Family Ties&quot;, in a 1988 episode entitled &quot;The Blues, Brother&quot;, in which he played the fictional blues musician Eddie Dupre. He also appeared in the television series &quot;Matlock&quot;, in a 1989 episode entitled &quot;The Blues Singer&quot;, playing a friend of an old blues musician (Joe Seneca) who is accused of murder. In the episode, McGhee, Seneca and star Andy Griffith perform a duet of &quot;The Midnight Special&quot;.

Happy Traum, a former guitar student of McGhee&#x27;s, edited a blues guitar instruction guide and songbook, &quot;Guitar Styles of Brownie McGhee&quot;, published in 1971, in which McGhee, between lessons, talked about his life and the blues. The autobiographical section features McGhee talking about growing up, his musical beginnings, and a history of the blues from the 1930s onward.

McGhee and Terry were both recipients of a 1982 National Heritage Fellowship awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts, which is the United States government&#x27;s highest honor in the folk and traditional arts. That year&#x27;s fellowships were the first bestowed by the NEA.

One of McGhee&#x27;s last concert appearances was at the 1995 Chicago Blues Festival.

He died of stomach cancer on February 16, 1996, in Oakland, California, at the age of 80.

McGhee was portrayed by Joshua Henry in the 2024 film &quot;A Complete Unknown&quot;.

<doc id="4739" wikidata="Q229478" url="?curid=4739" title="International Bureau of Weights and Measures">
<text>The International Bureau of Weights and Measures (, BIPM) is an intergovernmental organisation, through which its 64 member-states act on measurement standards in areas including chemistry, ionising radiation, physical metrology, as well as the International System of Units (SI) and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). It is based in Saint-Cloud, near Paris, France. The organisation has been referred to as IBWM (from its name in English) in older literature.

==Structure==
The BIPM is overseen by the International Committee for Weights and Measures (), a committee of eighteen members that meet normally in two sessions per year, which is in turn overseen by the General Conference on Weights and Measures () that meets in Paris usually once every four years, consisting of delegates of the governments of the Member States and observers from the Associates of the CGPM. These organs are also commonly referred to by their French initialisms.

==History==
The BIPM was created on 20 May 1875, following the signing of the Metre Convention, a treaty among 17 Member States. As of December 2024, there are now 64 members. 

It is based at the Pavillon de Breteuil in Saint-Cloud, France, a site (originally ) granted to the Bureau by the French Government in 1876. Since 1969 the site has been considered international territory, and the BIPM has all the rights and privileges accorded to an intergovernmental organisation. This status was further clarified by the French decree No 70-820 of 9 September 1970.

Several significant changes to the BIPM have been made throughout its history during the meetings overseen by the CGPM. An example of this would be how in the 12th general council meeting (held in 1964), the BIPM&#x27;s budget was increased from $300,000 to $600,000 per year. A historic moment for the BIPM occurred during the 26th CGPM in 2018. At this council, it was decided that world standard for the units of kilograms, seconds, amperes, Kelvins, moles, candelas, and meters would be redefined to reflect constants in nature. This is the first time this has happened since the creation of the BIPM. These changes were made official on World Metrology Day in 2019.

Beginning in 1970, the BIPM began publishing the SI Brochure, a document detailing an up-to-date version of the International System of Units. As of December 2024, the most recent version of the SI Brochure was the 9th edition published in 2019.

==Function==
The BIPM has the mandate to provide the basis for a single, coherent system of measurements throughout the world, traceable to the International System of Units (SI). This task takes many forms, from direct dissemination of units to coordination through international comparisons of national measurement standards (as in electricity and ionising radiation).

Following consultation, a draft version of the BIPM Work Programme is presented at each meeting of the General Conference for consideration with the BIPM budget. The final programme of work is determined by the CIPM in accordance with the budget agreed to by the CGPM.

Currently, the BIPM&#x27;s main work includes:

* Making brochures that define the International System of Units.

* Scientific and technical activities carried out in its four departments: chemistry, ionising radiation, physical metrology, and time
* Liaison and coordination work, including providing the secretariat for the CIPM Consultative Committees and some of their Working Groups and for the CIPM MRA, and providing institutional liaison with the other bodies supporting the international quality infrastructure and other international bodies
* Capacity building and knowledge transfer programs to increase the effectiveness within the worldwide metrology community of those Member State and Associates with emerging metrology systems
* A resource centre providing a database and publications for international metrology

The BIPM is one of the twelve member organisations of the International Network on Quality Infrastructure (INetQI), which promotes and implements QI activities in metrology, accreditation, standardisation and conformity assessment.

The BIPM has an important role in maintaining accurate worldwide time of day. It combines, analyses, and averages the official atomic time standards of member nations around the world to create a single, official Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

== Directors ==

Since its establishment, the directors of the BIPM have been:

<doc id="4741" wikidata="Q134674" url="?curid=4741" title="Bayonne">
<text>Bayonne () is a city in southwestern France near the Spanish border. It is a commune and one of two subprefectures in the Pyrénées-Atlantiques department, in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region.

Bayonne is located at the confluence of the Nive and Adour Rivers, in the northern part of the cultural region of the Basque Country. It is the seat of the Communauté d&#x27;agglomération du Pays Basque which roughly encompasses the western half of Pyrénées-Atlantiques, including the coastal city of Biarritz. The area also constitutes the southern part of Gascony, where the Aquitaine Basin joins the beginning of the Pre-Pyrenees.

Together with nearby Anglet, Biarritz, Saint-Jean-de-Luz and several smaller communes, Bayonne forms an urban area with 273,137 inhabitants in the 2018 census, 51,411 of whom lived in the commune of Bayonne proper. It is also a part of Basque Eurocity Bayonne-San Sebastián.

The site on the left bank of the Nive and the Adour was probably occupied before ancient times; a fortified enclosure was attested to in the 1st century, while the Tarbelli occupied the territory. Archaeological studies have confirmed the presence of a Roman castrum, a stronghold in Novempopulania at the end of the 4th century, before the city was populated by the Vascones.

In 1023, Bayonne was the capital of Labourd. In the 12th century, it extended to the confluence of the Nive River and beyond. During that time, its first bridge spanning the Adour was built. The city came under English control in 1152 through the marriage of Eleanor of Aquitaine; it became important commercially and, to a lesser degree, militarily thanks to maritime trade. In 1177, Richard the Lion Heart of England took control of the city, separating it from the Viscount of Labourd.

In 1451, the city was taken by the Crown of France after the Hundred Years&#x27; War. The loss of trade with the English was followed by the river gradually filling with silt and becoming impassable to ships. As the city developed to the north, its position was weakened compared to earlier times. The district of Saint-Esprit developed initially from settlement by Sephardic Jewish refugees fleeing the Spanish expulsions dictated by the Alhambra Decree. This community brought skill in chocolate making, and Bayonne gained a reputation for chocolate.

The course of the Adour was changed in 1578 by dredging under the direction of Louis de Foix, and the river returned to its former mouth. Bayonne flourished after regaining the maritime trade that it had lost for more than a hundred years. In the 17th century, the city was fortified by Vauban, whose works were followed as models of defense for 100 years. In 1814, Bayonne and its surroundings were the scene of fighting between the Napoleonic troops and the Spanish-Anglo-Portuguese coalition led by the Duke of Wellington. It was the last time the city was under siege.

In 1951, the Lacq gas field was discovered in the region; most of its extracted oil and sulphur are shipped from the port of Bayonne. During the second half of the 20th century, many housing estates were built, forming new districts on the periphery. The city developed to form a conurbation with Anglet and Biarritz; the agglomeration became the heart of a vast Basque-Landes urban area.

In 2014, Bayonne was a commune with more than 45,000 inhabitants, the heart of the urban area of Bayonne and of the &quot;Agglomeration Côte Basque-Adour&quot;. This includes Anglet and Biarritz. It is an important part of the Basque &quot;Bayonne-San Sebastián Eurocity&quot; and it plays the role of economic capital of the Adour basin. Modern industries—metallurgy and chemicals—have been established to take advantage of procurement opportunities and sea shipments through the harbour. Business services today represent the largest source of employment. Bayonne is also a cultural capital, a city with strong Basque and Gascon influences, and a rich historical past. Its heritage is expressed in its architecture, the diversity of collections in museums, its gastronomic specialties, and traditional events such as the noted Fêtes de Bayonne.

The inhabitants of the commune are known as &quot;Bayonnais&quot; or &quot;Bayonnaises&quot;.

==Toponymy==
===Etymology===
While the modern Basque spelling is &quot;Baiona&quot; and the same in Gascon Occitan, &quot;the name &quot;Bayonne&quot; poses a number of problems both historical and linguistic which have still not been clarified&quot;. There are different interpretations of its meaning.

The termination &quot;-onne&quot; in &quot;Bayonne&quot; can come from many in hydronyms &quot;-onne&quot; or toponyms derived from that. In certain cases the element &quot;-onne&quot; follows an Indo-European theme: &quot;*ud-r/n&quot; (Greek &quot;húdōr&quot; giving hydro, Gothic &quot;watt&quot; meaning &quot;water&quot;) hence &quot;*udnā&quot; meaning &quot;water&quot; giving &quot;unna&quot; then &quot;onno&quot; in the glossary of Vienne. &quot;Unna&quot; therefore would refer to the Adour. This toponymic type evoking a river traversing a locality is common. The appellative &quot;unna&quot; seems to be found in the name of the Garonne (&quot;Garunna&quot; 1st century; &quot;Garonna&quot; 4th century). However, it is possible to see a pre-Celtic suffix &quot;-ona&quot; in the name of the Charente (&quot;Karantona&quot; in 875) or the Charentonne (&quot;Carentona&quot; in 1050).

It could also be an augmentative Gascon from the original Latin radical &quot;Baia-&quot; with the suffix &quot;-ona&quot; in the sense of &quot;vast expanse of water&quot; or a name derived from the Basque &quot;bai&quot; meaning &quot;river&quot; and &quot;ona&quot; meaning &quot;good&quot;, hence &quot;good river&quot;.

The proposal by Eugene Goyheneche repeated by Manex Goyhenetche and supported by Jean-Baptiste Orpustan is &quot;bai una&quot;, &quot;the place of the river&quot; or &quot;bai ona&quot; &quot;hill by the river&quot;—&quot;Ibai&quot; means &quot;river&quot; in Basque and &quot;muinoa&quot; means &quot;hill&quot;.

&quot;It has perhaps been lost from sight that many urban place names in France, from north to south, came from the element &quot;Bay-&quot; or &quot;Bayon-&quot; such as: Bayons, Bayonville, Bayonvillers and pose the unusual problem of whether they are Basque or Gascon&quot; adds Pierre Hourmat. However, the most ancient form of Bayonne: &quot;Baiona&quot;, clearly indicates a feminine or a theme of &quot;-a&quot; whereas this is not the case for Béon or Bayon. In addition, the &quot;Bayon-&quot; in Bayonville or Bayonvillers in northern France is clearly the personal Germanic name &quot;Baio&quot;.

===Old attestations===
The names of the Basque province of Labourd and the locality of Bayonne have been attested from an early period with the place name &quot;Bayonne&quot; appearing in the Latin form &quot;Lapurdum&quot; after a period during which the two names could in turn designate a Viscounty or Bishopric.

&quot;Labourd&quot; and &quot;Bayonne&quot; were synonymous and used interchangeably until the 12th century before being differentiated: Labord for the province and Bayonne for the city. The attribution of Bayonne as &quot;Civitas Boatium&quot;, a place mentioned in the Antonine Itinerary and by Paul Raymond in his 1863 dictionary, has been abandoned. The city of the &quot;Boïates&quot; may possibly be La Teste-de-Buch but is certainly not Bayonne.

==History==

===Prehistory===
In the absence of accurate objective data there is some credence to the probable existence of a fishing village on the site in a period prior to ancient times. Numerous traces of human occupation have been found in the Bayonne region from the Middle Paleolithic especially in the discoveries at Saint-Pierre-d&#x27;Irube, a neighbouring locality. On the other hand, the presence of a mound about high has been detected in the current Cathedral Quarter overlooking the Nive, which formed a natural protection and a usable port on the left bank of the Nive. At the time, the mound was surrounded north and west by the Adour swamps. At its foot lies the famous &quot;Bayonne Sea&quot;—the junction of the two rivers—which may have been about wide between Saint-Esprit and the Grand Bayonne and totally covered the current location of Bourg-Neuf (in the district of Petit Bayonne). To the south, the last bend of the Nive widens near the Saint-Léon hills. Despite this, the narrowing of the Adour valley allows easier crossing than anywhere else along the entire length of the estuary.

In conclusion, the strategic importance of this height was so obvious it must be presumed that it has always been inhabited.

===Ancient times===
The oldest documented human occupation site is located on a hill overlooking the Nive and its confluence with the Adour.

In the 1st century AD, during the Roman occupation, Bayonne already seems to have been of some importance since the Romans surrounded the city with a wall to keep out the Tarbelli, Aquitani, or the proto-Basque who then occupied a territory that extended south of modern-day Landes, to the modern French Basque country, the Chalosse, the valleys of the Adour, the mountain streams of Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques, and to the Gave d&#x27;Oloron.

The archaeological discoveries of October and November 1995 provided a shred of evidence to support this projection. In the four layers of sub-soil along the foundation of the Gothic cathedral (in the &quot;apse of the cathedral&quot; area), a 2-metre depth was found of old objects from the end of the 1st century—in particular sigillated Gallic ceramics from Montans imitating Italian styles, thin-walled bowls, and fragments of amphorae. In the &quot;southern sector&quot; near the cloister door, there were objects from the second half of the 1st century as well as coins from the first half of the 3rd century.

A very high probability of human presence, not solely military, seems to provisionally confirm the occupation of the site at least around the third century.

A Roman castrum dating to the end of the 4th century has been proven as a fortified place of Novempopulania. Named &quot;Lapurdum&quot;, the name became the name of the province of &quot;Labourd&quot;. According to Eugene Goyheneche, the name &quot;Baiona&quot; designated the city, the port, and the cathedral while that of &quot;Lapurdum&quot; was only a territorial designation. This Roman settlement was strategic as it allowed the monitoring of the trans-Pyrenean roads and of local people rebellious to the Roman power. The construction covered 6 to 10 hectares according to several authors.

===Middle Ages===
The geographical location of the locality at the crossroads of a river system oriented from east to west and the road network connecting Europe to the Iberian Peninsula from north to south, predisposed the site to the double role of fortress and port. The city, after being Roman, alternated between the Vascones and the English for three centuries from the 12th to the 15th century.

The Romans left the city in the 4th century and the Basques, who had always been present, dominated the former Novempopulania province between the Garonne, the Ocean, and the Pyrénées. Novempopulania was renamed Vasconia and then Gascony after a Germanic deformation (resulting from the Visigoth and Frankish invasions). Basquisation of the plains region was too weak against the advance of romanization. From the mixture between the Basque and Latin language Gascon was created.

Documentation on Bayonne for the period from the High Middle Ages are virtually nonexistent, with the exception of two Norman intrusions: one questionable in 844 and a second attested in 892.

When Labourd was created in 1023, Bayonne was the capital and the Viscount resided there. The history of Bayonne proper started in 1056 when Raymond II the Younger, Bishop of Bazas, had the mission to build the Church of Bayonne

The construction was under the authority of Raymond III of Martres, Bishop of Bayonne from 1122 to 1125, combined with Viscount Bertrand for the Romanesque cathedral, the rear of which can still be seen today, and the first wooden bridge across the Adour extending the Mayou bridge over the Nive, which inaugurated the heyday of Bayonne. From 1120, new districts were created under population pressure. The development of areas between the old Roman city of Grand Bayonne and the Nive also developed during this period, then between the Nive and the Adour at the place that became Petit Bayonne. A Dominican Order Convent was located there in 1225 then that of the Cordeliers in 1247. Construction of and modifications to the defences of the city also developed to protect the new districts.

In 1130, the King of Aragon Alfonso the Battler besieged the city without success. Bayonne became an Angevin possession when Eleanor of Aquitaine married Henry Plantagenet, the future king of England, in 1152. This alliance gave Bayonne many commercial privileges. The Bayonnaises became carriers of Bordeaux wines and other south-western products like resin, ham, and woad to England. Bayonne was then an important military base. In 1177, King Richard separated the Viscounty of Labourd whose capital then became Ustaritz. Like many cities at the time, in 1215 Bayonne obtained the award of a municipal charter and was emancipated from feudal powers.

The official publication, in 1273, of a Coutume unique to the city, remained in force for five centuries until the separation of Bayonne from Labourd.

Bayonnaise industry at that time was dominated by shipbuilding: wood (oak, beech, chestnut from the Pyrenees, and pine from Landes) being overabundant. There was also maritime activity in providing crews for whaling, commercial marine or, and it was often so at a time when it was easy to turn any merchant ship into a warship, the English Royal Navy.

===Renaissance and modern times===


Jean de Dunois – a former companion at arms of Joan of Arc—captured the city on 20 August 1451 and annexed it to the Crown &quot;without making too many victims&quot;, but at the cost of a war indemnity of 40,000 gold Écus payable in a year,—thanks to the opportunism of the bishop who claimed to have seen &quot;a large white cross surmounted by a crown which turns into a fleur-de-lis in the sky&quot; to dissuade Bayonne from fighting against the royal troops.

The city continued to be fortified by the kings of France to protect it from danger from the Spanish border. In 1454, Charles VII created a separate judicial district: the &quot;Seneschal of Lannes&quot; a &quot;single subdivision of Guyenne during the English period&quot; which had jurisdiction over a wide area including Bayonne, Dax and Saint-Sever and which exercised civil justice, criminal jurisdiction within the competence of the district councilors. Over time, the &quot;Seneschal of the Sword&quot;, which was at Dax, lost any role other than protocol, and Bayonne, along with Dax and Saint-Sever, became the de facto seat of a separate Seneschal under the authority of a &quot;lieutenant-general of the Seneschal&quot;.

In May 1462, King Louis XI authorized the holding of two annual fairs by letters patent after signing the Treaty of Bayonne after which it was confirmed by the coutoumes of the inhabitants in July 1472 following the death of Charles de Valois, Duke de Berry, the king&#x27;s brother.

At the time the Spanish Inquisition raged in the Iberian Peninsula, Spanish and Portuguese Jews fled Spain and also later, Portugal, then settled in Southern France, including in Saint-Esprit (Pyrénées-Atlantiques), a northern district of Bayonne located along the northern bank of the Adour river. They brought with them chocolate and the recipe for its preparation. In 1750, the Jewish population in Saint-Esprit (Pyrénées-Atlantiques) is estimated to have reached about 3,500 people.

The golden age of the city ended in the 15th century with the loss of trade with England and the silting of the port of Bayonne created by the movement of the course of the Adour to the north.

At the beginning of the 16th century Labourd suffered the emergence of the plague. Its path can be tracked by reading the &quot;Registers&quot;. In July 1515, the city of Bayonne was &quot;prohibited to welcome people from plague-stricken places&quot; and on 21 October, &quot;we inhibit and prohibit all peasants and residents of this city [...] to go Parish Bidart [...] because of the contagion of the plague&quot;. On 11 April 1518, the plague raged in Saint-Jean-de-Luz and the city of Bayonne &quot;inhibited and prohibited for all peasants and city inhabitants and other foreigners to maintain relationships at the location and Parish of Saint-Jean-de-Luz where people have died of the plague&quot;. On 11 November 1518, the plague was present in Bayonne to the point that in 1519 the city council moved to the district of Brindos (Berindos at the time) in Anglet.

In 1523, Marshal Odet of Foix, Viscount of Lautrec resisted the Spaniards under Philibert of Chalon in the service of Charles V and lifted the siege of Bayonne. It was at Château-Vieux that the ransom demand for the release of Francis I, taken prisoner after his defeat at the Battle of Pavia, was gathered. 

The meeting in 1565 between Catherine de Medici and the envoy of Philip II: the Duke of Alba, is known as the &quot;Interview of Bayonne&quot;. At the time that Catholics and Protestants tore each other apart in parts of the kingdom of France, Bayonne seemed relatively untouched by these troubles. An iron fist from the city leaders did not appear to be unknown. In fact, they never hesitated to use violence and criminal sanctions for keeping order in the name of the &quot;public good&quot;. Two brothers, Saubat and Johannes Sorhaindo who were both lieutenants of the mayor of Bayonne in the second half of the 16th century, perfectly embody this period. They often wavered between Catholicism and Protestantism but always wanted to ensure the unity and prestige of the city.

In the 16th century, the king&#x27;s engineers, under the direction of Louis de Foix, were dispatched to rearrange the course of the Adour by creating an estuary to maintain the river bed. The river discharged in the right place to the Ocean on 28 October 1578. The port of Bayonne then attained a greater level of activity. Fishing for cod and whale ensured the wealth of fishermen and shipowners.

From 1611 to 1612, the college Principal of Bayonne was a man of 26 years old with a future: Cornelius Jansen known as &quot;Jansénius&quot;, the future Bishop of Ypres. Bayonne became the birthplace of Jansenism, an austere science which strongly disrupted the monarchy of Louis XIV.

During the sporadic conflicts that troubled the French countryside from the mid 17th century, Bayonne peasants wewhalesre short of powder and projectiles. They attached the long hunting knives in the barrels of their muskets and that way they fashioned makeshift spears later called &quot;bayonets&quot;. In that same century, Vauban was charged by Louis XIV to fortify the city. He added a citadel built on a hill overlooking the district of &quot;San Espirit Cap deou do Punt&quot;.

===French Revolution and Empire===
Activity in Bayonne peaked in the 18th century. The Chamber of Commerce was founded in 1726. Trade with Spain, the Netherlands, the Antilles, the cod fishery off the shores of Newfoundland, and construction sites maintained a high level of activity in the port.

In 1792, the district of Saint-Esprit (that revolutionaries renamed &quot;Port-de-la-Montagne&quot;) located on the right bank of the Adour, was separated from the city and renamed &quot;Jean-Jacques Rousseau&quot;. It was reunited with Bayonne on 1 June 1857. For 65 years, the autonomous commune was part of the department of Landes.

In 1808, at the Château of Marracq, the act of abdication of the Spanish king Charles IV in favour of Napoleon was signed under the &quot;friendly pressure&quot; of the Emperor. In the process, the Bayonne Statute was initialed as the first Spanish constitution.

Also in 1808, the French Empire imposed on the Duchy of Warsaw the Convention of Bayonne to buy from France the debts owed to it by Prussia. The debt, amounting to more than 43 million francs in gold, was bought at a discounted rate of 21 million francs. However, although the duchy made its payments in installments to France over a four-year period, Prussia was unable to pay it (due to a very large indemnity it owed to France resulting from the Treaties of Tilsit), causing the Polish economy to suffer heavily.

Trade was the wealth of the city in the 18th century but suffered greatly in the 19th century, severely sanctioned by conflict with Spain, its historic trading partner in the region. The Siege of Bayonne marked the end of the period with the surrender of the Napoleonic troops of Marshal Jean-de-Dieu Soult who were defeated by the coalition led by Wellington on 5 May 1814.

===19th and 20th centuries===
In 1854, the railway arrived from Paris bringing many tourists eager to enjoy the beaches of Biarritz. Bayonne turned instead to the steel industry with the forges of the Adour. The Port took on an industrial look but its slow decline seemed inexorable in the 19th century. The discovery of the Lacq gas field restored a certain dynamism.

The Treaty of Bayonne was concluded on 2 December 1856. It overcame the disputes in fixing the Franco-Spanish border in the area extending from the mouth of the Bidassoa to the border between Navarre and Aragon.The city built three light railway lines to connect to Biarritz at the beginning of the 20th century. The most direct line, that of the &quot;Tramway Bayonne-Lycée–Biarritz&quot; was operated from 1888 to 1948. In addition, a line further north served Anglet, operated by the &quot;Chemin de fer Bayonne-Anglet-Biarritz&quot; company from 1877 to 1953. Finally, a line following the Adour to its mouth and to the Atlantic Ocean by the bar in Anglet, was operated by &quot;VFDM réseau basque&quot; from 1919 to 1948.

On the morning of 23 December 1933, sub-prefect Anthelme received Gustave Tissier, the director of the &quot;Crédit Municipal de Bayonne&quot;. He responded well, with some astonishment, to his persistent interview. It did not surprise him to see the man unpacking what became the scam of the century.

&quot;Tissier, director of the &quot;Crédit Municipal&quot;, was arrested and imprisoned under suspicion of forgery and misappropriation of public funds. He had issued thousands of false bonds in the name of &quot;Crédit Municipal&quot; [...]&quot;

This was the beginning of the Stavisky Affair which, together with other scandals and political crises, led to the Paris riots of 6 February 1934.

===The World Wars===
The 249th Infantry Regiment, created from the 49th Infantry Regiment, was engaged in operations in the First World War, including action at Chemin des Dames, especially on the plateau of Craonne. 700 Bayonnaises perished in the conflict. A centre for engagement of foreign volunteers was established in August 1914, in Bayonne. Many nationalities were represented, particularly the Spanish, the Portuguese, the Czechs, and the Poles.

During the Second World War, Bayonne was occupied by the 3rd SS Panzer Division Totenkopf from 27 June 1940 to 23 August 1944.

On 5 April 1942, the Allies made a landing attempt in Bayonne but after a barge penetrated the Adour with great difficulty, the operation was cancelled.

On 21 August 1944, after blowing up twenty ships in port, German troops withdrew. On the 22nd, a final convoy of five vehicles passed through the city. It transported Gestapo Customs agents and some elements of the &quot;Feldgendarmerie&quot;. One or more Germans opened fire with machine guns killing three people. On the 23rd, there was an informal and immediate installation of a &quot;special municipal delegation&quot; by the young deputy prefect Guy Lamassoure representing the Provisional Government of the French Republic which had been established in Algiers since 27 June.

==Policy and administration==

===List of mayors under the Ancient Régime===
The Gramont family provided captains and governors in Bayonne from 1472 to 1789 as well as mayors, a post which became hereditary from 28 January 1590 by concession of Henry IV to Antoine II of Gramont. From the 15th century, they resided in the Château Neuf then in the Château-Vieux from the end of the 16th century:

*Roger de Gramont, (1444–1519), Lord of Gramont, Baron of Haux, Seneschal of Guyenne, hereditary mayor of Bayonne. He was an advisor and chamberlain of Louis XI in 1472 and then Charles VIII in 1483. He was Ambassador for Louis XII in Rome in 1502. He became governor of Bayonne and its castles on 26 February 1487. He died of the plague in 1519.
*Jean II de Gramont, Lord of Gramont, mayor and captain of Bayonne from 18 March 1523. On 15 September 1523, as a lieutenant in the company of Marshal Lautrec, he rescued Bayonne from the siege by the forces of Charles V under the command of the Prince of Orange. He died during the wars in Italy;
*Antoine I of Gramont, born in 1526, he was appointed at the age of nine years (1535) as mayor and captain of Bayonne. In 1571, he charged Louis de Foix with the changes to the mouth of the Adour along the fortifications of the city;
*Antoine II de Gramont (1572–1644), Count of Gramont, Guiche and Toulonjon, Viscount then Count of Louvigny, ruler of Bidache, Viscount of Aster, lord then baron of Lescun. He was a &quot;Duke de Brevet&quot; in 1643, but unverified by Parliament. On 28 January 1590, Henry IV granted him and his descendants the perpetual office of Mayor of Bayonne. He then became the Viceroy of Navarre. In 1595, Antoine II de Gramont charged Jean Errard (1599) then Louis de Millet (1612) to strengthen the defenses of the city;
*Antoine III of Gramont-Touloujon (1604–1678), Count and then, in 1648, Duke of Gramont, Prince of Bidache, Count of Guiche, Toulonjon, and Louvigny, Viscount of Astern, Baron of Andouins and Hagetmau, and lord of Lesparre, peer of France in 1648, Marshal of France in 1641. As Ambassador of Louis XIV, in 1660 he sought the hand of the Infanta Maria Theresa. The king gave him power of attorney to represent him in the marriage which was celebrated in Madrid. It was he who welcomed Louis XIV, Anne of Austria, Mazarin, and the rest of the Court to Bayonne. He died on 12 July 1678 at the Château-Vieux;
*Antoine Charles IV of Gramont (1641–1720), Duke of Gramont, Prince of Bidache, Count of Guiche and Louvigny, Viscount of Aster, Baron of Andouins and Hagetmau, Lord of Lesparre, peer of France, Viceroy of Navarre. In 1689, he continued the fortification works undertaken by Vauban in Bayonne, where he remained from 1706 to 1712. He supported Philip V during the War of the Spanish Succession, using Bayonne to supply his troops, weapons, reinforcements and subsidies. In retaliation, the opponents of Philip V organized two attacks in 1707: one at Château-Vieux leaving Antoine IV unharmed.

===Modern times===

List of Successive Mayors

;Mayors from 1941

===Cantons of Bayonne===
As per the Decree of 22 December 1789, Bayonne was part of two cantons: Bayonne-North-east, which includes part of Bayonne commune plus Boucau, Saint-Pierre-d&#x27;Irube, Lahonce, Mouguerre, and Urcuit; and Bayonne Northwest which consisted of the rest of Bayonne commune plus Anglet, Arcangues, and Bassussarry.

In a first revision of cantons in 1973, three cantons were created from the same total; geographic area: Bayonne North, Bayonne East, and Bayonne West. A further reconfiguration, in 1982, focused primarily on Bayonne and, apart from Bayonne North Canton, which also includes Boucau, the cantons of Bayonne East and Bayonne West did not change.

Starting from the 2015 French departmental elections which took place on 22 and 29 March, a new division took effect following the decree of 25 February 2014 Once again three cantons centred on Bayonne are defined: Bayonne-1—with part of Anglet; Bayonne-2—which includes Boucau; and Bayonne-3 now define the cantonal territorial division of the area.

===Judicial and administrative proceedings===
Bayonne is the seat of many courts for the region. It falls under the jurisdiction of the &quot;Tribunal d&#x27;instance&quot; (District court) of Bayonne, the &quot;Tribunal de grande instance&quot; (High Court) of Bayonne, the &quot;Cour d&#x27;appel&quot; (Court of Appeal) of Pau, the &quot;Tribunal pour enfants&quot; (Juvenile court) of Bayonne, the &quot;Conseil de prud&#x27;hommes&quot; (Labour Court) of Bayonne, the &quot;Tribunal de commerce&quot; (Commercial Court) of Bayonne, the &quot;Tribunal administratif&quot; (Administrative tribunal) of Pau, and the &quot;Cour administrative d&#x27;appel&quot; (Administrative Court of Appeal) of Bordeaux.

The commune has a police station, a Departmental Gendarmerie, an Autonomous Territorial Brigade of the district Gendarmerie, squadron 24/2 of Mobile Gendarmerie and a Tax collection office.

===Intercommunality===

The commune is part of twelve inter-communal structures of which eleven are based in the commune:

* the Communauté d&#x27;agglomération du Pays Basque;
* the transport association of Côte basque-Adour Agglomeration (STACBA);
* the intercommunal association for the management of the Txakurrak centre;
* the intercommunal association for the support of Basque culture;
* the Bil Ta Garbi joint association;
* the joint association for maritime Nive;
* the joint association for the Basque Museum and the History of Bayonne;
* the joint association for the development and monitoring of SCOT in the agglomeration of Bayonne and south Landes;
* the Kosta Garbia joint association;
* the joint association for the development of the European freight centre of Bayonne-Mouguerre-Lahonce;
* the joint association for operating the regional Maurice Ravel Conservatory.
* the Energy association of Pyrénées-Atlantiques;

The city of Bayonne is part of the &quot;Communauté d&#x27;agglomération du Pays Basque&quot; which also includes Anglet, Biarritz, Bidart, Boucau, Hendaye and Saint-Jean-de-Luz. The statutory powers of the structure extend to economic development—including higher education and research—housing and urban planning, public transport—through Transdev—alternative and the collection and recovery waste collection and management of rain and coastal waters, the sustainable development, interregional cooperation and finally 106.

In addition, Bayonne is part of the Basque Bayonne-San Sebastián Eurocity which is a European economic interest grouping (EEIG) established in 1993 based in San Sebastián.

===Twin towns – Sister cities===
Bayonne has twinning associations with:
==Geography==
Bayonne is located in the south-west of France on the western border between Basque Country and Gascony. It developed at the confluence of the Adour and tributary on the left bank, the Nive, 6 km from the Atlantic coast. The commune was part of the Basque province of Labourd.

===Geology and relief===
Bayonne occupies a territory characterized by a flat relief to the west and to the north towards the Landes forest, tending to slightly raise towards the south and east. The city has developed at the confluence of the Adour and Nive from the ocean. The meeting point of the two rivers coincides with a narrowing of the Adour valley. Above this, the alluvial plain extends for nearly towards both Tercis-les-Bains and Peyrehorade, and is characterized by swampy meadows called &quot;barthes&quot;. These are influenced by floods and high tides. Downstream from this point, the river has shaped a large, wide bed in the sand dunes, creating a significant bottleneck at the confluence.

The occupation of the hill that dominates this narrowing of the valley developed through a gradual spread across the lowlands. Occupants built embankments and the aggradation from flood soil.

The Nive has played a leading role in the development of the Bayonne river system in recent geological time by the formation of alluvial terraces; these form the sub-soil of Bayonne beneath the surface accumulations of silt and aeolian sands. The drainage network of the western Pre-Pyrenees evolved mostly from the Quaternary, from south-east to northwest, oriented east–west. The Adour was captured by the gaves and this system, together with the Nive, led to the emergence of a new alignment of the lower Adour and the Adour-Nive confluence. This capture has been dated to the early Quaternary (80,000 years ago).

Before this capture, the Nive had deposited pebbles from the Mindel glaciation of medium to large sizes; this slowed erosion of the hills causing the bottleneck at Bayonne. After the deposit of the lowest alluvial terrace ( high at Grand Bayonne), the course of the Adour became fixed in its lower reaches.

Subsequent to these deposits, there was a rise in sea level in the Holocene period (from 15,000 to 5000 years ago). This explains the invasion of the lower valleys with fine sand, peat, and mud with a thickness of more than below the current bed of the Adour and the Nive in Bayonne. These same deposits are spread across the barthes.

In the late Quaternary, the current topographic physiognomy was formed—i.e. a set of hills overlooking a swampy lowland. The promontory of Bassussarry–Marracq ultimately extended to the Labourdin foothills. The Grand Bayonne hill is an example. Similarly, on the right bank of the Nive, the heights of Château-Neuf (Mocoron Hill) met the latest advance of the plateau of Saint-Pierre-d&#x27;Irube (height ). On the right bank of the Adour, the heights of Castelnau (today the citadel), with an altitude of , and Fort (today Saint-Esprit), with an altitude of , rise above the Barthes of the Adour, the Nive, Bourgneuf, Saint-Frédéric, Sainte-Croix, Aritxague, and Pontots.

The area of the commune is and its altitude varies between .

===Hydrography===

The city developed along the river Adour. The river is part of the Natura 2000 network from its source at Bagnères-de-Bigorre to its exit to the Atlantic Ocean after Bayonne, between Tarnos (Landes) for the right bank and Anglet (Pyrénées-Atlantiques) for the left bank.

Apart from the Nive, which joins the left bank of the Adour after of a sometimes tumultuous course, two tributaries join the Adour in Bayonne commune: the &quot;Ruisseau de Portou&quot; and the &quot;Ruisseau du Moulin Esbouc&quot;. Tributaries of the Nive are the &quot;Ruisseau de Hillans&quot; and the &quot;Ruisseau d&#x27;Urdaintz&quot; which both rise in the commune.

===Climate===
The nearest weather station is that of Biarritz-Anglet.

The climate of Bayonne is relatively similar to that of its neighbour Biarritz, described below, with fairly heavy rainfall; the oceanic climate is due to the proximity of the Atlantic Ocean. The average winter temperature is around 8 °C, and around 20 °C in summer. The lowest temperature recorded was −12.7 °C on 16 January 1985 and the highest 40.6 °C on 4 August 2003 in the 2003 European heat wave. Rains on the Basque coast are rarely persistent except during winter storms. They often take the form of intense thunderstorms of short duration.

==Transport==

===Road===
Bayonne is located at the intersection of the A63 autoroute (Bordeaux-Spain) and the D1 extension of the A64 autoroute (towards Toulouse). The city is served by three interchanges—two of them on the A63: exit (Bayonne Nord) serves the northern districts of Bayonne but also allows quick access to the centre while exit (Bayonne Sud) provides access to the south and also serves Anglet. The third exit is the D1 / A64 via the Mousserolles interchange (exit Bayonne Mousserolles) which links the district of the same name and also serves the neighbouring communes of Mouguerre and Saint-Pierre-d&#x27;Irube.

Bayonne was traversed by Route nationale 10 connecting Paris to Hendaye but this is now downgraded to a departmental road D810. Route nationale 117, linking Bayonne to Toulouse has been downgraded to departmental road D817.

===Bridges===
There are several bridges over both the Nive and the Adour, linking the various districts.

Coming from upstream on the Adour, there is the A63 bridge, then the Saint-Frédéric bridge which carries the D 810, then the railway bridge that replaced the old Eiffel iron bridge, the Saint-Esprit bridge, and finally the Grenet bridge. The Saint-Esprit bridge connects the Saint-Esprit district to the Amiral-Bergeret dock just upstream of the confluence with the river Nive. In 1845, the old bridge, originally made of wood, was rebuilt in masonry with seven arches supporting a deck wide. It was then called the Nemours Bridge in honour of Louis of Orleans, sixth Duke of Nemours, who laid the first stone. The bridge was finally called Saint-Esprit. Until 1868, the bridge had a moving span near the left bank. It was expanded in 1912 to facilitate the movement of horse-drawn carriages and motor vehicles.

On the Nive coming from upstream to downstream, there is the A63 bridge then the &quot;Pont Blanc&quot; (White bridge) railway bridge, and then D810 bridge, the Génie bridge (or &quot;Pont Millitaire&quot;), the Pannecau bridge, the Marengo bridge leading to the covered markets, and the Mayou Bridge. The Pannecau bridge was long named &quot;Bertaco bridge&quot; and was rebuilt in masonry under Napoleon III. According to François Lafitte Houssat, &quot;[...] a municipal ordinance of 1327 provided for the imprisonment of any quarrellsome woman of bad character in an iron cage dropped into the waters of the Nive River from the bridge. The practice lasted until 1780 [...]&quot; This punishment bore the evocative name of &quot;cubainhade&quot;.

===Cycling network===
The commune is traversed by the &quot;Vélodyssée&quot;. Bicycle paths are located along the left bank of the Adour, a large part of the left bank of the Nive, and along various axes of the city where there are some bicycle lanes. The city offers free bicycles on loan.

Bayonne has the oldest French bullfighting tradition. A bylaw regulating the &quot;encierro&quot; is dated 1283: cows, oxen and bulls are released each year in the streets of Petit Bayonne during the summer festivals. The current arena, opened in 1893, is the largest in South-west France with more than 10,000 seats. A dozen bullfights are held each year, attracting the biggest names in bullfighting. Throughout summer several &quot;novilladas&quot; also take place. The city is a member of the &quot;Union of French bullfighting cities&quot;.

==Religion==

===Christian worship===
Bayonne is in the Diocese of Bayonne, Lescar and Oloron, with a suffragan bishop since 2002 under the Archdiocese of Bordeaux. Monseigneur Marc Aillet has been the bishop of this diocese since 15 October 2008. The diocese is located in Bayonne in the Place Monseigneur-Vansteenberghe.

Besides Bayonne Cathedral in Grand Bayonne, Bayonne has Saint-Esprit, Saint Andrew (Rue des Lisses), Arènes (Avenue of the Czech Legion), Saint-Étienne, and Saint-Amand (Avenue Marechal Soult) churches.

The &quot;Carmel of Bayonne&quot;, located in the Marracq district, has had a community of Carmelite nuns since 1858.

The &quot;Way of Baztan&quot; (also &quot;ruta del Baztan&quot; or &quot;camino Baztanés&quot;) is a way on the pilgrimage of Camino de Santiago which crosses the Pyrenees further west by the lowest pass (by the &quot;Col de Belate&quot;, 847 m). It is the ancient road used by pilgrims descending to Bayonne then either along the coast on the &quot;Way of Soulac&quot; or because they landed there from England, for example, to join the French Way as soon as possible in Pamplona. The &quot;Way of Bayonne&quot; joins the French Way further downstream at Burgos.

The Protestant church is located at the corner of Rue Albert-I st and Rue du Temple. A gospel church is located in the Saint-Esprit district where there is also a church belonging to the Gypsy Evangelical Church of the Protestant Federation of France.

===Jewish worship===
The synagogue was built in 1837 in the Saint-Esprit district north of the town. The Jewish community of Bayonne is old—it consists of different groups of fugitives from Navarre and Portugal who established at Saint-Esprit-lès-Bayonne after the expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492 and Portugal in 1496. In 1846, the Central Consistory moved to Saint-Esprit which was integrated with Bayonne in 1857.

The Jewish Cemetery of Bayonne was established in 1689 in the Saint-Étienne neighborhood in the northern quarter of the city. It was remodeled and enlarged in the 18th and 19th century and covers and area of two hectares.

==Economy==


===Population and income tax===
In 2011, the median household income tax was €22,605, placing Bayonne 28,406th place among the 31,886 communes with more than 49 households in metropolitan France.

In 2011, 47.8% of households were not taxable.

===Employment===
In 2011, the population aged from 15 to 64 years was 29,007 persons of which 70.8% were employable, 60.3% in employment and 10.5% unemployed. While there were 30,012 jobs in the employment area, against 29,220 in 2006, and the number of employed workers residing in the employment area was 17,667, the indicator of job concentration is 169.9% which means that the employment area offers nearly two jobs for every available worker.

===Businesses and shops===
Bayonne is the economic capital of the agglomeration of Bayonne and southern Landes. The table below details the number of companies located in Bayonne according to their industry:

The table below shows employees by business establishments in terms of numbers:

The following comments apply to the two previous tables:
*the bulk of economic activity is provided by companies in the tertiary sector;
*Agriculture is almost non-existent Note 54;
*less than 5% of the activity is from the industrial sector which remains focused on establishments of less than 50 employees, as also are construction-related activities;
*public administration, education, health and social services are activities of over 20% of establishments, confirming the importance of Bayonne as an administrative centre.

In 2013, 549 new establishments were created in Bayonne including 406 sole proprietorships.

===Workshops and Industry===
Bayonne has few of such industries, as indicated in the previous tables. There is &quot;Plastitube&quot; specializing in plastic packaging (190 employees). The Izarra liqueur company set up a distillery in 1912 at Quai Amiral-Bergeret and has long symbolized the economic wealth of Bayonne. Industrial activities are concentrated in the neighbouring communes of Boucau, Tarnos (Turbomeca), Mouguerre, and Anglet.

Bayonne is known for its fine chocolates, produced in the town for 500 years, and Bayonne ham, a cured ham seasoned with peppers from nearby Espelette. Izarra, the liqueur made in bright green or yellow colours, is distilled locally. It is said by some that Bayonne is the birthplace of mayonnaise, supposedly a corruption of &quot;Bayonnaise&quot;, the French adjective describing the city&#x27;s people and produce. Now bayonnaise can refer to a particular mayonnaise flavoured with the Espelette chillis.

Bayonne is now the centre of certain craft industries that were once widespread, including the manufacture of &quot;makilas&quot;, traditional Basque walking-sticks. The Fabrique Alza just outside the city is known for its &quot;palas&quot;, bats used in &quot;pelota&quot;, the traditional Basque sport.

===Service activities===
The active tertiary sector includes some large retail chains such as those detailed by geographer Roger Brunet: BUT (240 staff), Carrefour (150 staff), E.Leclerc (150 staff), Leroy Merlin (130 staff), and Galeries Lafayette (120 employees). Banks, cleaning companies (Onet, 170 employees), and security (Brink&#x27;s, 100 employees) are also major employers in the commune, as is urban transport which employs nearly 200 staff. Five health clinics, providing a total of more than 500 beds, each employ 120 to 170 staff.

===The port of Bayonne===
The port of Bayonne is located at the mouth of the Adour, downstream of the city. It also occupies part of communes of Anglet and Boucau in Pyrenees-Atlantiques and Tarnos in Landes. It benefits greatly from the natural gas field of Lacq to which it is connected by pipeline. This is the ninth largest French port for trade with an annual traffic of about 4.2 million tonnes of which 2.8 is export. It is also the largest French port for export of maize. It is the property of the Aquitaine region who manage and control the site. Metallurgical products movement are more than one million tons per year and maize exports to Spain vary between 800,000 and 1 million tons. The port also receives refined oil products from the TotalEnergies oil refinery at Donges (800,000 tons per year). Fertilizers are a traffic of 500,000 tons per year and sulphur from Lacq, albeit in sharp decline, is 400,000 tons.

The port also receives Ford and General Motors vehicles from Spain and Portugal and wood both tropical and from Landes.

===Tourism services===

Due to its proximity to the ocean and the foothills of the Pyrenees as well as its historic heritage, Bayonne has developed important activities related to tourism.

On 31 December 2012, there were 15 hotels in the city offering more than 800 rooms to visitors, but there were no camp sites. The tourist infrastructure in the surrounding urban area of Bayonne complements the local supply with around 5800 rooms spread over nearly 200 hotels and 86 campsites offering over 14,000 beds.

==Sights==

The Nive divides Bayonne into Grand Bayonne and Petit Bayonne with five bridges between the two, both quarters still being backed by Vauban&#x27;s walls. The houses lining the Nive are examples of Basque architecture, with half-timbering and shutters in the national colours of red and green. The much wider Adour is to the north. The Pont Saint-Esprit connects Petit Bayonne with the Quartier Saint-Esprit across the Adour, where the massive Citadelle and the railway station are located. Grand Bayonne is the commercial and civic hub, with small pedestrianised streets packed with shops, plus the cathedral and the Hôtel de Ville.

The Cathédrale Sainte-Marie is a Gothic-style building constructed between the 13th and 15th centuries. The tower spires were not added until the 19th century, during a substantial restoration project. The cathedral houses the shrine of Saint-Léon de Carentan, 9th-century Bishop of Bayonne, and is a recognized UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Nearby is the Château Vieux, some of which dates back to the 12th century, where the governors of the city were based, including the English Black Prince.

The Musée Basque is an ethnographic museum of the entire Basque Country. Opened in February 1924, the museum has special exhibitions on Basque agriculture and history, seafaring, &quot;pelota&quot;, and handicrafts.

The Musée Bonnat began with a large collection bequeathed by the local-born painter Léon Bonnat. The museum is one of the best galleries in south west France and has paintings by Edgar Degas, El Greco, Sandro Botticelli, and Francisco Goya, among others.

At the back of Petit Bayonne is the Château Neuf, among the ramparts. Now an exhibition space, it was started by the newly arrived French in 1460 to control the city. The walls nearby have been opened to visitors. They are important for plant life now and Bayonne&#x27;s botanic gardens adjoin the walls on both sides of the Nive.

The area across the Adour is largely residential and industrial, with much demolished to make way for the railway. The Saint-Esprit church was part of a bigger complex built by Louis XI to care for pilgrims to Santiago de Compostela. It is home to a wooden &quot;Flight into Egypt&quot; sculpture.

Overlooking the quarter is Vauban&#x27;s 1680 Citadelle. The soldiers of Wellington&#x27;s army who died besieging the citadelle in 1813 are buried in the nearby English Cemetery, visited by Queen Victoria and other British dignitaries when staying in Biarritz.

The distillery of the famous local liqueur Izarra is located on the northern bank of the Adour and is open to visitors.

<doc id="4742" wikidata="Q997465" url="?curid=4742" title="Bubblegum Crisis">
<text>is a 1987 to 1991 cyberpunk original video animation (OVA) series produced by Youmex and animated by AIC and Artmic.

The series involves the adventures of the Knight Sabers, an all-female group of mercenaries who don powered exoskeletons and fight numerous problems, most frequently rogue robots. The success of the series spawned several sequel series.

==Plot==
The series begins in late 2032, seven years after the Second Great Kanto earthquake has split Tokyo geographically and culturally in two and it also forced the United States of America to annex Japan in the legitimate name of keeping the peace and from it descending into anarchy. During the first episode, disparities in wealth are shown to be more pronounced than in previous periods in post-war Japan. The main adversary is Genom, a megacorporation with immense power and global influence. Its main product are boomers—artificial cybernetic life forms that are usually in the form of humans, with most of their bodies being machine; also known as &quot;cyberoids&quot;. While Boomers are intended to serve mankind, they become deadly instruments in the hands of ruthless individuals. The AD Police (Advanced Police) are tasked to deal with Boomer-related crimes. One of the series&#x27; themes is the inability of the department to deal with threats due to political infighting, red tape, and an insufficient budget.

==Setting==
The setting displays strong influences from the movies &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and &quot;Streets of Fire&quot;. The opening sequence of episode 1 is even modeled on that of the latter film. The humanoid robots known as &quot;boomers&quot; in the series were inspired by several movies, including Replicants from the aforementioned &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, the titular cyborgs of the &quot;Terminator&quot; film franchise, and the Beast from the film &quot;Krull&quot;.

Suzuki explained in a 1993 &quot;Animerica&quot; interview the meaning behind the cryptic title: &quot;We originally named the series &#x27;bubblegum&#x27; to reflect a world in crisis, like a chewing-gum bubble that&#x27;s about to burst.&quot;

==Production==
The series started with Toshimichi Suzuki&#x27;s intention to remake the 1982 film &quot;Techno Police 21C&quot;. In 1985, he met Junji Fujita and the two discussed ideas, and decided to collaborate on what later became &quot;Bubblegum Crisis&quot;. Kenichi Sonoda acted as character designer, and designed the four female leads. Masami Ōbari created the mechanical designs. Obari would also go on to direct episodes 5 and 6. Satoshi Urushihara acted as the chief production supervisor and guest character designer for Episode 7.

The OVA series is eight episodes long, made as eight separate works, with lengths varying from 26 to 52 minutes.

A common misunderstanding that has developed, dating back as far as at least the mid-2000s, is that the series was planned and written to be 13 episodes, and that either legal or financial issues resulted in the series having only eight episodes. The prevalence of this belief has resulted in it appearing in discussions of the series, even in Anime News Network articles and encyclopedia, and an &quot;Otaku USA&quot; feature from 2011.

However, commentaries and interviews with production staff contradict this. Production designer Hideki Kakinuma said in commentary notes that appeared with the 2018 Animeigo release of the OVA series, &quot;At the time there was no plan to make it into a series, each film was going to be made one at a time.&quot; Katsuhito Akiyama, director of OVA parts 1, 2, and 3 echoed this in a November 1997 interview, recalling challenges in directing the OVA parts and creating a narrative due to a lack of long-term plan, &quot;...it was not easy to keep on producing episodes without knowing a clear plan of how many total they want us to make.&quot; Further the staff don&#x27;t discuss or mention the existence of these issues hampering the project in these interviews and commentaries, which included directors, voice actresses, character designers, even AIC president Tōru Miura. Akiyama recalled the experience of working on the production as &quot;fun&quot;.

==Cast==

===Additional voices===
English: Amanda Tancredi, Chuck Denson Jr., Chuck Kinlaw, David Kraus, Eliot Preschutti, Gray Sibley, Hadley Eure, Hank Troscianiec, J. Patrick Lawlor, Jack Bowden, Jay Bryson, Kevin Reilly, Marc Garber, Marc Matney, Michael Sinterniklaas, Scott Simpson, Sean Clay, Sophia Tolar, Steve Lalla, Steve Rassin, Steve Vernon, Zach Hanner

==Episodes==
==Release==
In North America, AnimEigo first released &quot;Bubblegum Crisis&quot; to VHS and Laserdisc in 1991 in Japanese with English subtitles. The series is notable in that it was one of the few early anime series that were brought over from Japan unedited and subtitled in English. While anime has become much more popular in the years since, in 1991, it was still mostly unknown as a storytelling medium in North America. &quot;Bubblegum Crisis&quot; was aired in the US when it first aired on PBS affiliate Superstation KTEH in the 1990s, and STARZ!&#x27;s Action Channel in 2000. 

An English dub of the series was produced beginning in 1994 by AnimEigo through Southwynde Studios in Wilmington, NC, and released to VHS and Laserdisc beginning that year. A digitally-remastered compilation, featuring bilingual audio tracks and production extras, was released on DVD in 2004 by AnimEigo. The company later successfully crowdfunded a collector&#x27;s edition Blu-ray release through Kickstarter in November 2013. The series was released on a regular edition Blu-ray on September 25, 2018. The series is currently available for streaming on Night Flight Plus.

===Soundtracks===
There are eight soundtrack releases (one per OVA), as well as numerous &quot;vocal&quot; albums which feature songs &quot;inspired by&quot; the series as well as many drawn directly from it.

==Reception==
Critical reception of &quot;Bubblegum Crisis&quot; has been generally positive. Raphael See of THEM Anime Reviews gave the series a rating of 4 out of 5 stars, praising the quality of the animation, the soundtrack, and the series&#x27; sense of humor. However, he suggested it was held back by a low quality dub, a lack of character development, and an inconsistent plot, saying that while some episodes were &quot;really solid&quot;, others would leave out many major details, forcing the viewer to make their own assumptions: &quot;Overall, not a bad watch. In fact, at times, &quot;Bubblegum Crisis&quot; can be really good. Unfortunately, oversights and carelessness here and there keep this series from being all it can be.&quot;

Tim Henderson of Anime News Network gave the series an A− rating, praising the animation, soundtrack, story, and characters. He states that the series gets better with every passing episode, and that the final two episodes are the best of the series.

==Legacy==
Masaki Kajishima and Hiroki Hayashi, who both worked on the &quot;Bubblegum Crisis&quot; OVAs, cite the show as being the inspiration for their harem series &quot;Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki&quot;. In an interview with AIC, Hayashi described &quot;Bubblegum Crisis&quot; as &quot;a pretty gloomy anime. Serious fighting, complicated human relationships, and dark Mega Tokyo.&quot; They thought it would be fun to create some comedy episodes with ideas like the girls going to the hot springs, but it was rejected by the sponsors. He also said that there was a trend to have a bunch of characters of one gender and a single one of the other gender, and asked what if Mackey (Sylia&#x27;s brother) was a main character, reversing the &quot;Bubblegum&quot; scenario. This idea then became the basis for Tenchi. Hayashi said that Mackey is &quot;sort of&quot; the original model for Tenchi.

Kevin Siembieda&#x27;s becoming aware of &quot;Boomers&quot; being already in use in this caused him to change his planned name for the &quot;Rifts&quot; RPG which he had named after the &quot;Boom Gun&quot;–wielding power armor which was also renamed to &quot;Glitter Boy&quot;.

The production staff was said to have consulted with the original anime&#x27;s staff members, Shinji Aramaki and Kenichi Sonoda, to help maintain consistency with the world of the original. However, no further developments have been announced.

<doc id="4745" wikidata="Q817393" url="?curid=4745" title="Black people">
<text>Black is a racialized classification of people, usually a political and skin color-based category for specific populations with a mid- to dark brown complexion. Not all people considered &quot;black&quot; have dark skin; in certain countries, often in socially based systems of racial classification in the Western world, the term &quot;black&quot; is used to describe persons who are perceived as dark-skinned compared to other populations. It is most commonly used for people of sub-Saharan African ancestry, Indigenous Australians and Melanesians, though it has been applied in many contexts to other groups, and is no indicator of any close ancestral relationship whatsoever. Indigenous African societies do not use the term &quot;black&quot; as a racial identity outside of influences brought by Western cultures.

Contemporary anthropologists and other scientists, while recognizing the reality of biological variation between different human populations, regard the concept of a unified, distinguishable &quot;Black race&quot; as socially constructed. Different societies apply different criteria regarding who is classified &quot;black&quot;, and these social constructs have changed over time. In a number of countries, societal variables affect classification as much as skin color, and the social criteria for &quot;blackness&quot; vary. Some perceive the term &#x27;black&#x27; as a derogatory, outdated, reductive or otherwise unrepresentative label, and as a result neither use nor define it, especially in African countries with little to no history of colonial racial segregation.

In the anglosphere the term can carry a variety of meanings depending on the country. In the United Kingdom, &quot;black&quot; was historically equivalent with &quot;person of color&quot;, a general term for non-European peoples. While the term &quot;person of color&quot; is commonly used and accepted in the United States, the near-sounding term &quot;colored person&quot; is considered highly offensive, except in South Africa, where it is a descriptor for a person of mixed race. In other regions such as Australasia, settlers applied the adjective &quot;black&quot; to the indigenous population. It was universally regarded as highly offensive in Australia until the 1960s and 70s. &quot;Black&quot; was generally not used as a noun, but rather as an adjective qualifying some other descriptor (e.g. &quot;black ****&quot;). As desegregation progressed after the 1967 referendum, some Aboriginals adopted the term, following the American fashion, but it remains problematic.

Several American style guides, including the &quot;AP Stylebook&quot;, changed their guides to capitalize the &#x27;b&#x27; in &#x27;black&#x27;, following the 2020 murder of George Floyd, an African American. The &quot;ASA Style Guide&quot; says that the &#x27;b&#x27; should not be capitalized.

==Africa==

===Northern Africa===

Numerous communities of dark-skinned peoples are present in North Africa, some dating from prehistoric communities. Others descend from migrants via the historical trans-Saharan trade or, after the Arab invasions of North Africa in the 7th century, from slaves from the trans-Saharan slave trade in North Africa.
In the 18th century, the Moroccan Sultan Moulay Ismail &quot;the Warrior King&quot; (1672–1727) raised a corps of 150,000 black soldiers, called his Black Guard.

According to Carlos Moore, resident scholar at Brazil&#x27;s University of the State of Bahia, in the 21st century Afro-multiracials in the Arab world, including Arabs in North Africa, self-identify in ways that resemble multi-racials in Latin America. He claims that darker-toned Arabs, much like darker-toned Latin Americans, consider themselves white because they have some distant white ancestry.

Egyptian President Anwar Sadat had a mother who was a dark-skinned Nubian Sudanese (Sudanese Arab) woman and a father who was a lighter-skinned Egyptian. In response to an advertisement for an acting position, as a young man he said, &quot;I am not white but I am not exactly black either. My blackness is tending to reddish&quot;.

Due to the patriarchal nature of Arab society, Arab men, including during the slave trade in North Africa, enslaved more African women than men. The female slaves were often put to work in domestic service and agriculture. The men interpreted the Quran to permit sexual relations between a male master and his enslaved females outside of marriage (see Ma malakat aymanukum and sex), leading to many mixed-race children. When an enslaved woman became pregnant with her Arab master&#x27;s child, she was considered as &quot;umm walad&quot; or &quot;mother of a child&quot;, a status that granted her privileged rights. The child was given rights of inheritance to the father&#x27;s property, so mixed-race children could share in any wealth of the father. Because the society was patrilineal, the children inherited their fathers&#x27; social status at birth and were born free.

Some mixed-race children succeeded their respective fathers as rulers, such as Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur, who ruled Morocco from 1578 to 1608. He was not technically considered as a mixed-race child of a slave; his mother was Fulani and a concubine of his father.

In early 1991, non-Arabs of the Zaghawa people of Sudan attested that they were victims of an intensifying Arab apartheid campaign, segregating Arabs and non-Arabs (specifically, people of Nilotic ancestry). Sudanese Arabs, who controlled the government, were widely referred to as practicing apartheid against Sudan&#x27;s non-Arab citizens. The government was accused of &quot;deftly manipulating Arab solidarity&quot; to carry out policies of apartheid and ethnic cleansing.

Sudanese Arabs are also black people in that they are culturally and linguistically Arabized indigenous peoples of Sudan of mostly Nilo-Saharan, Nubian, and Cushitic ancestry; their skin tone and appearance resembles that of other black people.

American University economist George Ayittey accused the Arab government of Sudan of practicing acts of racism against black citizens. According to Ayittey, &quot;In Sudan... the Arabs monopolized power and excluded blacks – Arab apartheid.&quot; Many African commentators joined Ayittey in accusing Sudan of practicing Arab apartheid.

===Sahara===

In the Sahara, the native Tuareg Berber populations kept &quot;negro&quot; slaves. Most of these captives were of Nilo-Saharan extraction, and were either purchased by the Tuareg nobles from slave markets in the Western Sudan or taken during raids. Their origin is denoted via the Ahaggar Berber word &quot;Ibenheren&quot; (sing. &quot;Ébenher&quot;), which alludes to slaves that only spoke a Nilo-Saharan language. These slaves were also sometimes known by the borrowed Songhay term &quot;Bella&quot;.

Similarly, the Sahrawi indigenous peoples of the Western Sahara observed a class system consisting of high castes and low castes. Outside of these traditional tribal boundaries were &quot;Negro&quot; slaves, who were drawn from the surrounding areas.

===North-Eastern Africa===

In Ethiopia and Somalia, the slave classes mainly consisted of captured peoples from the Sudanese-Ethiopian and Kenyan-Somali international borders or other surrounding areas of Nilotic and Bantu peoples who were collectively known as &quot;Shanqella&quot; and &quot;Adone&quot; (both analogues to &quot;negro&quot; in an English-speaking context). Some of these slaves were captured during territorial conflicts in the Horn of Africa and then sold off to slave merchants. The earliest representation of this tradition dates from a seventh or eighth century BC inscription belonging to the Kingdom of Damat.

These captives and others of analogous morphology were distinguished as &quot;tsalim barya&quot; (dark-skinned slave) in contrast with the Afroasiatic-speaking nobles or &quot;saba qayh&quot; (&quot;red men&quot;) or light-skinned slave; while on the other hand, western racial category standards do not differentiate between &quot;saba qayh&quot; (&quot;red men&quot;—light-skinned) or &quot;saba tiqur&quot; (&quot;black men&quot;—dark-skinned) Horn Africans (of either Afroasiatic-speaking, Nilotic-speaking or Bantu origin) thus considering all of them as &quot;black people&quot; (and in some case &quot;negro&quot;) according to Western society&#x27;s notion of race.

===Southern Africa===
In South Africa, the period of colonisation resulted in many unions and marriages between European and Africans (Bantu peoples of South Africa and Khoisans) from various tribes, resulting in mixed-race children. As the European colonialists acquired control of territory, they generally pushed the mixed-race and African populations into second-class status. During the first half of the 20th century, the white-dominated government classified the population according to four main racial groups: &quot;Black&quot;, &quot;White&quot;, &quot;Asian&quot; (mostly Indian), and &quot;Coloured&quot;. The Coloured group included people of mixed Bantu, Khoisan, and European ancestry (with some Malay ancestry, especially in the Western Cape). The Coloured definition occupied an intermediary political position between the Black and White definitions in South Africa. It imposed a system of legal racial segregation, a complex of laws known as apartheid.

The apartheid bureaucracy devised complex (and often arbitrary) criteria in the Population Registration Act of 1945 to determine who belonged in which group. Minor officials administered tests to enforce the classifications. When it was unclear from a person&#x27;s physical appearance whether the individual should be considered Coloured or Black, the &quot;pencil test&quot; was used. A pencil was inserted into a person&#x27;s hair to determine if the hair was kinky enough to hold the pencil, rather than having it pass through, as it would with smoother hair. If so, the person was classified as Black. Such classifications sometimes divided families.

Sandra Laing is a South African woman who was classified as Coloured by authorities during the apartheid era, due to her skin colour and hair texture, although her parents could prove at least three generations of European ancestors. At age 10, she was expelled from her all-white school. The officials&#x27; decisions based on her anomalous appearance disrupted her family and adult life. She was the subject of the 2008 biographical dramatic film &quot;Skin&quot;, which won numerous awards. During the apartheid era, those classed as &quot;Coloured&quot; were oppressed and discriminated against. But, they had limited rights and overall had slightly better socioeconomic conditions than those classed as &quot;Black&quot;. The government required that Blacks and Coloureds live in areas separate from Whites, creating large townships located away from the cities as areas for Blacks.

In the post-apartheid era, the Constitution of South Africa has declared the country to be a &quot;Non-racial democracy&quot;. In an effort to redress past injustices, the ANC government has introduced laws in support of affirmative action policies for Blacks; under these they define &quot;Black&quot; people to include &quot;Africans&quot;, &quot;Coloureds&quot; and &quot;Asians&quot;. Some affirmative action policies favor &quot;Africans&quot; over &quot;Coloureds&quot; in terms of qualifying for certain benefits. Some South Africans categorized as &quot;African Black&quot; say that &quot;Coloureds&quot; did not suffer as much as they did during apartheid. &quot;Coloured&quot; South Africans are known to discuss their dilemma by saying, &quot;we were not white enough under apartheid, and we are not black enough under the ANC (African National Congress)&quot;.

In 2008, the High Court in South Africa ruled that Chinese South Africans who were residents during the apartheid era (and their descendants) are to be reclassified as &quot;Black people&quot;, solely for the purposes of accessing affirmative action benefits, because they were also &quot;disadvantaged&quot; by racial discrimination. Chinese people who arrived in the country after the end of apartheid do not qualify for such benefits.

Other than by appearance, &quot;Coloureds&quot; can usually be distinguished from &quot;Blacks&quot; by language. Most speak Afrikaans or English as a first language, as opposed to Bantu languages such as Zulu or Xhosa. They also tend to have more European-sounding names than Bantu names.
==Asia==
===Afro-Asians===
&quot;Afro-Asians&quot; or &quot;African-Asians&quot; are persons of mixed sub-Saharan African and Asian ancestry. In the United States, they are also called &quot;black Asians&quot; or &quot;Blasians&quot;. Historically, Afro-Asian populations have been marginalized as a result of human migration and social conflict.
===Western Asia===

====Arab world====

In the medieval Arab world, the ethnic designation of &quot;Black&quot; encompassed not only Zanj, or Africans, but also communities like Zutt, Sindis and Indians from the Indian subcontinent. Historians estimate that between the advent of Islam in 650 CE and the abolition of slavery in the Arabian Peninsula in the mid-20th century, 10 to 18 million black Africans (known as the Zanj) were enslaved by east African slave traders and transported to the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries. This number far exceeded the number of slaves who were taken to the Americas. Slavery in Saudi Arabia and slavery in Yemen was abolished in 1962, slavery in Dubai in 1963, and slavery in Oman in 1970.

Several factors affected the visibility of descendants of this diaspora in 21st-century Arab societies: The traders shipped more female slaves than males, as there was a demand for them to serve as concubines in harems in the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries. Male slaves were castrated in order to serve as harem guards. The death toll of black African slaves from forced labor was high. The mixed-race children of female slaves and Arab owners were assimilated into the Arab owners&#x27; families under the patrilineal kinship system. As a result, few distinctive Afro-Arab communities have survived in the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries.

Distinctive and self-identified black communities have been reported in countries such as Iraq, with a reported 1.2 million black people (Afro-Iraqis), and they attest to a history of discrimination. These descendants of the Zanj have sought minority status from the government, which would reserve some seats in Parliament for representatives of their population. According to Alamin M. Mazrui et al., generally in the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries, most of these communities identify as both black and Arab.

====Iran====
Afro-Iranians are people of black African ancestry residing in Iran. During the Qajar dynasty, many wealthy households imported black African women and children as slaves to perform domestic work. This slave labor was drawn exclusively from the Zanj, who were Bantu-speaking peoples that lived along the African Great Lakes, in an area roughly comprising modern-day Tanzania, Mozambique and Malawi.

====Israel====

About 150,000 East African and black people live in Israel, amounting to just over 2% of the nation&#x27;s population. The vast majority of these, some 120,000, are Beta Israel, most of whom are recent immigrants who came during the 1980s and 1990s from Ethiopia. In addition, Israel is home to more than 5,000 members of the African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem movement that are ancestry of African Americans who emigrated to Israel in the 20th century, and who reside mainly in a distinct neighborhood in the Negev town of Dimona. Unknown numbers of black converts to Judaism reside in Israel, most of them converts from the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States.

Additionally, there are around 60,000 non-Jewish African immigrants in Israel, some of whom have sought asylum. Most of the migrants are from communities in Sudan and Eritrea, particularly the Niger-Congo-speaking Nuba groups of the southern Nuba Mountains; some are illegal immigrants.

====Turkey====

Beginning several centuries ago, during the period of the Ottoman Empire, tens of thousands of Zanj captives were brought by slave traders to plantations and agricultural areas situated between Antalya and Istanbul, which gave rise to the Afro-Turk population in present-day Turkey. Some of their ancestry remained &quot;in situ&quot;, and many migrated to larger cities and towns. Other black slaves were transported to Crete, from where they or their descendants later reached the İzmir area through the population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1923, or indirectly from Ayvalık in pursuit of work.

Apart from the historical Afro-Turk presence Turkey also hosts a sizeable immigrant black population since the end of the 1990s. The community is composed mostly of modern immigrants from Ghana, Ethiopia, DRC, Sudan, Nigeria, Kenya, Eritrea, Somalia and Senegal. According to official figures 1.5 million Africans live in Turkey and around 25% of them are located in Istanbul. Other studies state the majority of Africans in Turkey lives in Istanbul and report Tarlabaşı, Dolapdere, Kumkapı, Yenikapı and Kurtuluş as having a strong African presence.

Most of the African immigrants in Turkey come to Turkey to further migrate to Europe. Immigrants from Eastern Africa are usually refugees, meanwhile Western and Central African immigration is reported to be economically driven. It is reported that African immigrants in Turkey regularly face economic and social challenges, notably racism and opposition to immigration by locals.

===Southern Asia===

The Siddi are an ethnic group inhabiting India and Pakistan. Members are descended from the Bantu peoples of Southeast Africa. Some were merchants, sailors, indentured servants, slaves or mercenaries. The Siddi population is currently estimated at 270,000–350,000 individuals, living mostly in Karnataka, Gujarat, and Hyderabad in India and Makran and Karachi in Pakistan. In the Makran strip of the Sindh and Balochistan provinces in southwestern Pakistan, these Bantu descendants are known as the Makrani. There was a brief &quot;Black Power&quot; movement in Sindh in the 1960s and many Siddi are proud of and celebrate their African ancestry.

===Southeastern Asia===
Negritos, are a collection of various, often unrelated peoples, who were once considered a single distinct population of closely related groups, but genetic studies showed that they descended from the same ancient East Eurasian meta-population which gave rise to modern East Asian peoples, and consist of several separate groups, as well as displaying genetic heterogeneity. They inhabit isolated parts of Southeast Asia, and are now confined primarily to Southern Thailand, the Malay Peninsula, and the Andaman Islands of India.

Negrito means &quot;little black people&quot; in Spanish (negrito is the Spanish diminutive of negro, i.e., &quot;little black person&quot;); it is what the Spaniards called the aborigines that they encountered in the Philippines. The term &quot;Negrito&quot; itself has come under criticism in countries like Malaysia, where it is now interchangeable with the more acceptable Semang, although this term actually refers to a specific group.

They have dark skin, often curly-hair and Asiatic facial characteristics, and are stockily built.

Negritos in the Philippines frequently face discrimination. Because of their traditional hunter-gatherer lifestyle, they are marginalized and live in poverty, unable to find employment.

==Europe==

===Western Europe===
====France====
While census collection of ethnic background is illegal in France, it is estimated that there are about 2.5 – 5 million black people residing there.

====Germany====
As of 2020, there are approximately one million black people living in Germany.

====Netherlands====

Afro-Dutch are residents of the Netherlands who are of Black African or Afro-Caribbean ancestry. They tend to be from the former and present Dutch overseas territories of Aruba, Bonaire, Curaçao, Sint Maarten and Suriname. The Netherlands also has sizable Cape Verdean and other African communities.

==== Portugal ====
As of 2021, there were at least 232,000 people of recent Black-African immigrant background living in Portugal. They mainly live in the regions of Lisbon, Porto, Coimbra. As Portugal doesn&#x27;t collect information dealing with ethnicity, the estimate includes only people that, as of 2021, hold the citizenship of a Sub Saharan African country or people who have acquired Portuguese citizenship from 2008 to 2021, thus excluding descendants, people of more distant African ancestry or people who have settled in Portugal generations ago and are now Portuguese citizens.

====Spain====
The term &quot;Moors&quot; has been used in Europe in a broader, somewhat derogatory sense to refer to Muslims, especially those of Arab or Berber ancestry, whether living in North Africa or Iberia. Moors were not a distinct or self-defined people. Medieval and early modern Europeans applied the name to Muslim Arabs, Berbers, Sub-Saharan Africans and Europeans alike.

Isidore of Seville, writing in the 7th century, claimed that the Latin word Maurus was derived from the Greek &quot;mauron&quot;, μαύρον, which is the Greek word for &quot;black&quot;. Indeed, by the time Isidore of Seville came to write his &quot;Etymologies&quot;, the word Maurus or &quot;Moor&quot; had become an adjective in Latin, &quot;for the Greeks call black, mauron&quot;. &quot;In Isidore&#x27;s day, Moors were black by definition...&quot;

Afro-Spaniards are Spanish nationals of West/Central African ancestry. Today, they mainly come from Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Gambia, Mali, Nigeria and Senegal. Additionally, many Afro-Spaniards born in Spain are from the former Spanish colony Equatorial Guinea. Today, there are an estimated 683,000 Afro-Spaniards in Spain.

====United Kingdom====

According to the Office for National Statistics, at the 2001 census there were more than a million black people in the United Kingdom; 1% of the total population described themselves as &quot;Black Caribbean&quot;, 0.8% as &quot;Black African&quot;, and 0.2% as &quot;Black other&quot;. Britain encouraged the immigration of workers from the Caribbean after World War II; the first symbolic movement was of those who came on the ship the &quot;Empire Windrush&quot; and, hence, those who migrated between 1948 and 1970 are known as the Windrush generation. The preferred official umbrella term is &quot;black, Asian and minority ethnic&quot; (BAME), but sometimes the term &quot;black&quot; is used on its own, to express unified opposition to racism, as in the Southall Black Sisters, which started with a mainly British Asian constituency, and the National Black Police Association, which has a membership of &quot;African, African-Caribbean and Asian origin&quot;.

===Eastern Europe===
As African states became independent in the 1960s, the Soviet Union offered many of their citizens the chance to study in Russia. Over a period of 40 years, about 400,000 African students from various countries moved to Russia to pursue higher studies, including many black Africans. This extended beyond the Soviet Union to many countries of the Eastern bloc.

====Balkans====
Due to the slave trade in the Ottoman Empire that had flourished in the Balkans, the coastal town of Ulcinj in Montenegro had its own black community. In 1878, that community consisted of about 100 people.
==Oceania==

===Indigenous Australians===
Indigenous Australians have been referred to as &quot;black people&quot; in Australia since the early days of European settlement. While originally related to skin colour, the term is used today to indicate Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander ancestry in general and can refer to people of any skin pigmentation.

Being identified as either &quot;black&quot; or &quot;white&quot; in Australia during the 19th and early 20th centuries was critical in one&#x27;s employment and social prospects. Various state-based Aboriginal Protection Boards were established which had virtually complete control over the lives of Indigenous Australians – where they lived, their employment, marriage, education and included the power to separate children from their parents. Aborigines were not allowed to vote and were often confined to reserves and forced into low paid or effectively slave labour. The social position of mixed-race or &quot;half-caste&quot; individuals varied over time. A 1913 report by Baldwin Spencer states that:

After the First World War, however, it became apparent that the number of mixed-race people was growing at a faster rate than the white population, and, by 1930, fear of the &quot;half-caste menace&quot; undermining the White Australia ideal from within was being taken as a serious concern. Cecil Cook, the Northern Territory Protector of Natives, noted that:

The official policy became one of biological and cultural assimilation: &quot;Eliminate the full-blood and permit the white admixture to half-castes and eventually the race will become white&quot;. This led to different treatment for &quot;black&quot; and &quot;half-caste&quot; individuals, with lighter-skinned individuals targeted for removal from their families to be raised as &quot;white&quot; people and prohibited from speaking their native language and practicing traditional customs, a process now known as the Stolen Generation.
The second half of the 20th century to the present has seen a gradual shift towards improved human rights for Aboriginal people. In a 1967 referendum, more than 90% of the Australian population voted to end constitutional discrimination and to include Aborigines in the national census. During this period, many Aboriginal activists began to embrace the term &quot;black&quot; and use their ancestry as a source of pride. Activist Bob Maza said:
In 1978, Aboriginal writer Kevin Gilbert received the National Book Council award for his book &quot;Living Black: Blacks Talk to Kevin Gilbert&quot;, a collection of Aboriginal people&#x27;s stories, and in 1998 was awarded (but refused to accept) the Human Rights Award for Literature for &quot;Inside Black Australia&quot;, a poetry anthology and exhibition of Aboriginal photography. In contrast to previous definitions based solely on the degree of Aboriginal ancestry, the Government changed the legal definition of Aboriginal in 1990 to include any:
This nationwide acceptance and recognition of Aboriginal people led to a significant increase in the number of people self-identifying as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. The reappropriation of the term &quot;black&quot; with a positive and more inclusive meaning has resulted in its widespread use in mainstream Australian culture, including public media outlets, government agencies, and private companies. In 2012, a number of high-profile cases highlighted the legal and community attitude that identifying as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander is not dependent on skin color, with a well-known boxer Anthony Mundine being widely criticized for questioning the &quot;blackness&quot; of another boxer and journalist Andrew Bolt being successfully sued for publishing discriminatory comments about Aboriginals with light skin.

===Melanesians===

The region of Melanesia is named from Greek , &quot;black&quot;, and , &quot;island&quot;, etymologically meaning &quot;islands of black [people]&quot;, in reference to the dark skin of the indigenous peoples. Early European settlers, such as Spanish explorer Yñigo Ortiz de Retez, noted the resemblance of the people to those in Africa.

Melanesians, along with other Pacific Islanders, were frequently deceived or coerced during the 19th and 20th centuries into forced labour for sugarcane, cotton, and coffee planters in countries distant to their native lands in a practice known as blackbirding. In Queensland, some 55,000 to 62,500 were brought from the New Hebrides, the Solomon Islands, and New Guinea to work in sugarcane fields. Under the Pacific Island Labourers Act 1901, most islanders working in Queensland were repatriated back to their homelands. 
Those who remained in Australia, commonly called South Sea Islanders, often faced discrimination similarly to Indigenous Australians by white-dominated society. Many indigenous rights activists have South Sea Islander ancestry, including Faith Bandler, Evelyn Scott and Bonita Mabo.

Many Melanesians have taken up the term &#x27;Melanesia&#x27; as a way to empower themselves as a collective people. Stephanie Lawson writes that the term &quot;moved from a term of denigration to one of affirmation, providing a positive basis for contemporary subregional identity as well as a formal organisation&quot;. For instance, the term is used in the Melanesian Spearhead Group, which seeks to promote economic growth among Melanesian countries.

===Other===

John Caesar, nicknamed &quot;Black Caesar&quot;, a convict and bushranger with parents born in an unknown area in Africa, was one of the first people of recent black African ancestry to arrive in Australia.

At the 2006 Census, 248,605 residents declared that they were born in Africa. This figure pertains to all immigrants to Australia who were born in nations in Africa regardless of race, and includes white Africans.

==North America==

===Canada===

&quot;Black Canadians&quot; is a designation used for people of black African ancestry who are citizens or permanent residents of Canada. The majority of black Canadians are of Caribbean origin, though the population also consists of African American immigrants and their descendants (including black Nova Scotians), as well as many African immigrants.

Black Canadians often draw a distinction between those of Afro-Caribbean ancestry and those of other African roots. The term &quot;African Canadian&quot; is occasionally used by some black Canadians who trace their heritage to the first slaves brought by British and French colonists to the North American mainland. Promised freedom by the British during the American Revolutionary War, thousands of Black Loyalists were resettled by the Crown in Canada afterward, such as Thomas Peters. In addition, an estimated ten to thirty thousand fugitive slaves reached freedom in Canada from the Southern United States during the Antebellum years, aided by people along the Underground Railroad.

Many black people of Caribbean origin in Canada reject the term &quot;African Canadian&quot; as an elision of the uniquely Caribbean aspects of their heritage, and instead identify as &quot;Caribbean Canadian&quot;. Unlike in the United States, where &quot;African American&quot; has become a widely used term, in Canada controversies associated with distinguishing African or Caribbean heritage have resulted in the term &quot;black Canadian&quot; being widely accepted there.

===United States===

There were eight principal areas used by Europeans to buy and ship slaves to the Western Hemisphere. The number of enslaved people sold to the New World varied throughout the slave trade. As for the distribution of slaves from regions of activity, certain areas produced far more enslaved people than others. Between 1650 and 1900, 10.24 million enslaved West Africans arrived in the Americas from the following regions in the following proportions:

* Senegambia (Senegal and The Gambia): 4.8%
* Upper Guinea (Guinea-Bissau, Guinea and Sierra Leone): 4.1%
* Windward Coast (Liberia and Ivory Coast): 1.8%
* Gold Coast (Ghana and east of Ivory Coast): 10.4%
* Bight of Benin (Togo, Benin and Nigeria west of the Niger Delta): 20.2%
* Bight of Biafra (Nigeria east of the Niger Delta, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon): 14.6%
* West Central Africa (Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Angola): 39.4%
* Southeastern Africa (Mozambique and Madagascar): 4.7%
By the early 1900s, &quot;nigger&quot; had become a pejorative word in the United States. In its stead, the term &quot;colored&quot; became the mainstream alternative to &quot;negro&quot; and its derived terms. After the American Civil Rights Movement, the terms &quot;colored&quot; and &quot;negro&quot; gave way to &quot;black&quot;. &quot;Negro&quot; had superseded &quot;colored&quot; as the most polite word for African Americans at a time when &quot;black&quot; was considered more offensive. This term was accepted as normal, including by people classified as Negroes, until the later Civil Rights movement in the late 1960s. One well-known example is the use by Dr. Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. of &quot;Negro&quot; in his famous speech of 1963, I Have a Dream. During the American civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, some African-American leaders in the United States, notably Malcolm X, objected to the word &quot;Negro&quot; because they associated it with the long history of slavery, segregation, and discrimination that treated African Americans as second-class citizens, or worse. Malcolm X preferred &quot;Black&quot; to &quot;Negro&quot;, but later gradually abandoned that as well for &quot;Afro-American&quot; after leaving the Nation of Islam.

Since the late 1960s, various other terms for African Americans have been more widespread in popular usage. Aside from &quot;black American&quot;, these include &quot;Afro-American&quot; (in use from the late 1960s to 1990) and &quot;African American&quot; (used in the United States to refer to Black Americans, people often referred to in the past as &quot;American Negroes&quot;).

In the first 200 years that black people were in the United States, they primarily identified themselves by their specific ethnic group (closely allied to language) and not by skin color. Individuals identified themselves, for example, as Ashanti, Igbo, Bakongo, or Wolof. However, when the first captives were brought to the Americas, they were often combined with other groups from West Africa, and individual ethnic affiliations were not generally acknowledged by English colonists. In areas of the Upper South, different ethnic groups were brought together. This is significant as the captives came from a vast geographic region: the West African coastline stretching from Senegal to Angola and in some cases from the south-east coast such as Mozambique. A new &quot;African-American&quot; identity and culture was born that incorporated elements of the various ethnic groups and of European cultural heritage, resulting in fusions such as the Black church and African-American English. This new identity was based on provenance and slave status rather than membership in any one ethnic group.

By contrast, slave records from Louisiana show that the French and Spanish colonists recorded more complete identities of the West Africans, including ethnicities and given tribal names.

The U.S. racial or ethnic classification &quot;black&quot; refers to people with all possible kinds of skin pigmentation, from the darkest through to the very lightest skin colors, including albinos, if they are believed by others to have African ancestry (in any discernible percentage). There are also certain cultural traits associated with being &quot;African American&quot;, a term used effectively as a synonym for &quot;black person&quot; within the United States.

In March 1807, Great Britain, which largely controlled the Atlantic, declared the transatlantic slave trade illegal, as did the United States. (The latter prohibition took effect 1 January 1808, the earliest date on which Congress had the power to do so after protecting the slave trade under of the United States Constitution.)

By that time, the majority of black people in the United States were native-born, so the use of the term &quot;African&quot; became problematic. Though initially a source of pride, many blacks feared that the use of African as an identity would be a hindrance to their fight for full citizenship in the United States. They also felt that it would give ammunition to those who were advocating repatriating black people back to Africa. In 1835, black leaders called upon Black Americans to remove the title of &quot;African&quot; from their institutions and replace it with &quot;Negro&quot; or &quot;Colored American&quot;. A few institutions chose to keep their historic names, such as the African Methodist Episcopal Church. African Americans popularly used the terms &quot;Negro&quot; or &quot;colored&quot; for themselves until the late 1960s.

The term &quot;black&quot; was used throughout but not frequently since it carried a certain stigma. In his 1963 &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech, Martin Luther King Jr. uses the terms &quot;negro&quot; fifteen times and &quot;black&quot; four times. Each time that he uses &quot;black&quot;, it is in parallel construction with &quot;white&quot;; for example, &quot;black men and white men&quot;.

With the successes of the American Civil Rights Movement, a new term was needed to break from the past and help shed the reminders of legalized discrimination. In place of &quot;Negro&quot;, activists promoted the use of &quot;black&quot; as standing for racial pride, militancy, and power. Some of the turning points included the use of the term &quot;Black Power&quot; by Kwame Ture (Stokely Carmichael) and the popular singer James Brown&#x27;s song &quot;Say It Loud – I&#x27;m Black and I&#x27;m Proud&quot;.

In 1988, the civil rights leader Jesse Jackson urged Americans to use instead the term &quot;African American&quot; because it had a historical cultural base and was a construction similar to terms used by European descendants, such as German American, Italian American, etc. Since then, African American and black have often had parallel status. However, controversy continues over which, if any, of the two terms is more appropriate. Maulana Karenga argues that the term African-American is more appropriate because it accurately articulates their geographical and historical origin. Others have argued that &quot;black&quot; is a better term because &quot;African&quot; suggests foreignness, although black Americans helped found the United States. Still others believe that the term &quot;black&quot; is inaccurate because African Americans have a variety of skin tones. Some surveys suggest that the majority of Black Americans have no preference for &quot;African American&quot; or &quot;black&quot;, although they have a slight preference for &quot;black&quot; in personal settings and &quot;African American&quot; in more formal settings.

In the U.S. census race definitions, black and African Americans are citizens and residents of the United States with origins in the black racial groups of Africa. According to the Office of Management and Budget, the grouping includes individuals who self-identify as African American, as well as persons who emigrated from nations in the Caribbean and sub-Saharan Africa. The grouping is thus based on geography, and may contradict or misrepresent an individual&#x27;s self-identification, since not all immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa are &quot;black&quot;. The Census Bureau also notes that these classifications are socio-political constructs and should not be interpreted as scientific or anthropological.

According to U.S. Census Bureau data, African immigrants generally do not self-identify as African American. The overwhelming majority of African immigrants identify instead with their own respective ethnicities (~95%). Immigrants from some Caribbean, Central American and South American nations and their descendants may or may not also self-identify with the term.

Recent surveys of African Americans using a genetic testing service have found varied ancestries that show different tendencies by region and sex of ancestors. These studies found that on average, African Americans have 73.2–80.9% West African, 18–24% European, and 0.8–0.9% Native American genetic heritage, with large variation between individuals.

According to studies in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, U.S. residents consistently overestimate the size, physical strength, and formidability of young black men.

===New Great Migration===

The New Great Migration is not evenly distributed throughout the South. As with the earlier Great Migration, the New Great Migration is primarily directed toward cities and large urban areas, such as Atlanta, Charlotte, Houston, Dallas, Raleigh, Washington, D.C., Tampa, Virginia Beach, San Antonio, Memphis, Orlando, Nashville, Jacksonville, and so forth. North Carolina&#x27;s Charlotte metro area in particular, is a hot spot for African American migrants in the US. Between 1975 and 1980, Charlotte saw a net gain of 2,725 African Americans in the area. This number continued to rise as between 1985 and 1990 as the area had a net gain of 7,497 African Americans, and from 1995 to 2000 the net gain was 23,313 African Americans. 

This rise in net gain points to Atlanta, Charlotte, Dallas, and Houston being a growing hot spots for the migrants of The New Great Migration. The percentage of Black Americans who live in the South has been increasing since 1990, and the biggest gains have been in the region&#x27;s large urban areas, according to census data. The Black population of metro Atlanta more than doubled between 1990 and 2020, surpassing 2 million in the most recent census. The Black population also more than doubled in metro Charlotte while Greater Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth both saw their Black populations surpass 1 million for the first time. Several smaller metro areas also saw sizable gains, including San Antonio; Raleigh and Greensboro, N.C.; and Orlando. Primary destinations are states that have the most job opportunities, especially Georgia, North Carolina, Maryland, Virginia, Tennessee, Florida and Texas. Other southern states, including Mississippi, Louisiana, South Carolina, Alabama and Arkansas, have seen little net growth in the African American population from return migration.

====One-drop rule====

From the late 19th century, the South used a colloquial term, the &quot;one-drop rule&quot;, to classify as black a person of any known African ancestry. This practice of hypodescent was not put into law until the early 20th century. Legally, the definition varied from state to state. Racial definition was more flexible in the 18th and 19th centuries before the American Civil War. For instance, President Thomas Jefferson held in slavery persons who were legally white (less than 25% black) according to Virginia law at the time, but, because they were born to slave mothers, they were born into slavery, according to the principle of &quot;partus sequitur ventrem&quot;, which Virginia adopted into law in 1662.

Outside of the United States, some other countries have adopted the one-drop rule, but the definition of who is black and the extent to which the one-drop &quot;rule&quot; applies varies greatly from country to country.

The one-drop rule may have originated as a means of increasing the number of black slaves and was maintained as an attempt to keep the white race &quot;pure&quot;. One of the results of the one-drop rule was the uniting of the African-American community. Some of the most prominent abolitionists and civil-rights activists of the 19th century were multiracial, such as Frederick Douglass, Robert Purvis and James Mercer Langston. They advocated equality for all.

====Blackness====
The concept of blackness in the United States has been described as the degree to which one associates themselves with mainstream African-American culture, politics, and values. To a certain extent, this concept is not so much about race but more about political orientation, culture and behavior. Blackness can be contrasted with &quot;acting white&quot;, where black Americans are said to behave with assumed characteristics of stereotypical white Americans with regard to fashion, dialect, taste in music, and possibly, from the perspective of a significant number of black youth, academic achievement.

Due to the often political and cultural contours of blackness in the United States, the notion of blackness can also be extended to non-black people. Toni Morrison once described Bill Clinton as the first black President of the United States, because, as she put it, he displayed &quot;almost every trope of blackness&quot;. Clinton welcomed the label.

The question of blackness also arose in the Democrat Barack Obama&#x27;s 2008 presidential campaign. Commentators questioned whether Obama, who was elected the first president with black ancestry, was &quot;black enough&quot;, contending that his background is not typical because his mother was a white American and his father was a black student visitor from Kenya. Obama chose to identify as black and African American.

===Mexico===
The 2015 preliminary survey to the 2020 census allowed Afro-Mexicans to self-identify for the first time in Mexico and recorded a total of 1.4 million (1.2% of the total Mexican population). The majority of Afro-Mexicans live in the Costa Chica of Guerrero region.

===Caribbean===

====Dominican Republic====

The first Afro-Dominican slaves were shipped to the Dominican Republic by Spanish conquistadors during the Transatlantic slave trade.

====Puerto Rico====

Spanish conquistadors shipped slaves from West Africa to Puerto Rico. Afro-Puerto Ricans in part trace ancestry to this colonization of the island.

==South America==

Approximately 12 million people were shipped from Africa to the Americas during the Atlantic slave trade from 1492 to 1888. Of these, 11.5 million of those shipped to South America and the Caribbean. Brazil was the largest importer in the Americas, with 5.5 million African slaves imported, followed by the British Caribbean with 2.76 million, the Spanish Caribbean and Spanish Mainland with 1.59 million Africans, and the French Caribbean with 1.32 million. Today their descendants number approximately 150 million in South America and the Caribbean. In addition to skin color, other physical characteristics such as facial features and hair texture are often variously used in classifying peoples as black in South America and the Caribbean. In South America and the Caribbean, classification as black is also closely tied to social status and socioeconomic variables, especially in light of social conceptions of &quot;blanqueamiento&quot; (racial whitening) and related concepts.

===Brazil===

The concept of race in Brazil is complex. A Brazilian child was never automatically identified with the racial type of one or both of their parents, nor were there only two categories to choose from. Between an individual of unmixed West African ancestry and a very light mulatto individual, more than a dozen racial categories were acknowledged, based on various combinations of hair color, hair texture, eye color, and skin color. These types grade into each other like the colors of the spectrum, and no one category stands significantly isolated from the rest. In Brazil, people are classified by appearance, not heredity.

Scholars disagree over the effects of social status on racial classifications in Brazil. It is generally believed that achieving upward mobility and education results in individuals being classified as a category of lighter skin. The popular claim is that in Brazil, poor whites are considered black and wealthy blacks are considered white. Some scholars disagree, arguing that &quot;whitening&quot; of one&#x27;s social status may be open to people of mixed race, a large part of the population known as &quot;pardo&quot;, but a person perceived as &quot;preto&quot; (black) will continue to be classified as black regardless of wealth or social status.

====Statistics====

From the years 1500 to 1850, an estimated 3.5 million captives were forcibly shipped from West/Central Africa to Brazil. The territory received the highest number of slaves of any country in the Americas. Scholars estimate that more than half of the Brazilian population is at least in part descended from these individuals. Brazil has the largest population of Afro-ancestry outside Africa. In contrast to the US, during the slavery period and after, the Portuguese colonial government in Brazil and the later Brazilian government did not pass formal anti-miscegenation or segregation laws. As in other Latin American countries, intermarriage was prevalent during the colonial period and continued afterward. In addition, people of mixed race (&quot;pardo&quot;) often tended to marry white spouses, and their descendants became accepted as white. As a result, some of the European descended population also has West African or Amerindian blood. According to the last census of the 20th century, in which Brazilians could choose from five color/ethnic categories with which they identified, 54% of individuals identified as white, 6.2% identified as black, and 39.5% identified as pardo (brown)—a broad multi-racial category, including tri-racial persons.

In the 19th century, a philosophy of racial whitening emerged in Brazil, related to the assimilation of mixed-race people into the white population through intermarriage. Until recently the government did not keep data on race. However, statisticians estimate that in 1835, roughly 50% of the population was &quot;preto&quot; (black; most were enslaved), a further 20% was &quot;pardo&quot; (brown), and 25% white, with the remainder Amerindian. Some classified as pardo were tri-racial.

By the 2000 census, demographic changes including the end to slavery, immigration from Europe and Asia, assimilation of multiracial persons, and other factors resulted in a population in which 6.2% of the population identified as black, 40% as pardo, and 55% as white. Essentially most of the black population was absorbed into the multi-racial category by intermixing. A 2007 genetic study found that at least 29% of the middle-class, white Brazilian population had some recent (since 1822 and the end of the colonial period) African ancestry.

====Race relations in Brazil====

According to the 2022 census, 10.2% of Brazilians said they were black, compared with 7.6% in 2010, and 45.3% said they were racially mixed, up from 43.1%, while the proportion of self-declared white Brazilians has fallen from 47.7% to 43.5%. Activists from Brazil&#x27;s Black movement attribute the racial shift in the population to a growing sense of pride among African-descended Brazilians in recognising and celebrating their ancestry.

The philosophy of the racial democracy in Brazil has drawn some criticism, based on economic issues. Brazil has one of the largest gaps in income distribution in the world. The richest 10% of the population earn 28 times the average income of the bottom 40%. The richest 10 percent is almost exclusively white or predominantly European in ancestry. One-third of the population lives under the poverty line, with blacks and other people of color accounting for 70 percent of the poor.

In 2015 United States, African Americans, including multiracial people, earned 76.8% as much as white people. By contrast, black and mixed race Brazilians earned on average 58% as much as whites in 2014. The gap in income between blacks and other non-whites is relatively small compared to the large gap between whites and all people of color. Other social factors, such as illiteracy and education levels, show the same patterns of disadvantage for people of color.
Some commentators observe that the United States practice of segregation and white supremacy in the South, and discrimination in many areas outside that region, forced many African Americans to unite in the civil rights struggle, whereas the fluid nature of race in Brazil has divided individuals of African ancestry between those with more or less ancestry and helped sustain an image of the country as an example of post-colonial harmony. This has hindered the development of a common identity among black Brazilians.

Though Brazilians of at least partial African heritage make up a large percentage of the population, few blacks have been elected as politicians. The city of Salvador, Bahia, for instance, is 80% people of color, but voters have not elected a mayor of color.

Patterns of discrimination against non-whites have led some academic and other activists to advocate for use of the Portuguese term &quot;negro&quot; to encompass all African-descended people, in order to stimulate a &quot;black&quot; consciousness and identity.

===Colombia===

Afro-Colombians are the third-largest African diaspora population in Latin America after Afro-Brazilians and Afro-Haitians.

===Venezuela===

Most black Venezuelans descend from people brought as slaves to Venezuela directly from Africa during colonization; others have been descendants of immigrants from the Antilles and Colombia. Many blacks were part of the independence movement, and several managed to be heroes. There is a deep-rooted heritage of African culture in Venezuelan culture, as demonstrated in many traditional Venezuelan music and dances, such as the Tambor, a musical genre inherited from black members of the colony, or the Llanera music or the Gaita zuliana that both are a fusion of all the three major peoples that contribute to the cultural heritage. Also, black inheritance is present in the country&#x27;s gastronomy.

There are entire communities of blacks in the Barlovento zone, as well as part of the Bolívar state and in other small towns; they also live peaceably among the general population in the rest of Venezuela. Currently, blacks represent a plurality of the Venezuelan population, although many are actually mixed people.

<text>Plague is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot;. Symptoms include fever, weakness and headache. Usually this begins one to seven days after exposure. There are three forms of plague, each affecting a different part of the body and causing associated symptoms. Pneumonic plague infects the lungs, causing shortness of breath, coughing and chest pain; bubonic plague affects the lymph nodes, making them swell; and septicemic plague infects the blood and can cause tissues to turn black and die.

The bubonic and septicemic forms are generally spread by flea bites or handling an infected animal, whereas pneumonic plague is generally spread between people through the air via infectious droplets. Diagnosis is typically by finding the bacterium in fluid from a lymph node, blood or sputum.

Those at high risk may be vaccinated. Those exposed to a case of pneumonic plague may be treated with preventive medication. If infected, treatment is with antibiotics and supportive care. Typically antibiotics include a combination of gentamicin and a fluoroquinolone. The risk of death with treatment is about 10% while without it is about 70%.

Globally, about 600 cases are reported a year. In 2017, the countries with the most cases include the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar and Peru. In the United States, infections occasionally occur in rural areas, where the bacteria are believed to circulate among rodents. It has historically occurred in large outbreaks, with the best known being the Black Death in the 14th century, which resulted in more than 50 million deaths in Europe.

==Signs and symptoms==
There are several different clinical manifestations of plague. The most common form is bubonic plague, followed by septicemic and pneumonic plague. Other clinical manifestations include plague meningitis, plague pharyngitis, and ocular plague. General symptoms of plague include fever, chills, headaches, and nausea. Many people experience swelling in their lymph nodes if they have bubonic plague. For those with pneumonic plague, symptoms may (or may not) include a cough, pain in the chest, and haemoptysis.

===Bubonic plague===


When a flea bites a human and contaminates the wound with regurgitated blood, the plague-causing bacteria are passed into the tissue. &quot;Y. pestis&quot; can reproduce inside cells, so even if phagocytosed, they can still survive. Once in the body, the bacteria can enter the lymphatic system, which drains interstitial fluid. Plague bacteria secrete several toxins, one of which is known to cause beta-adrenergic blockade.

&quot;Y. pestis&quot; spreads through the lymphatic vessels of the infected human until it reaches a lymph node, where it causes acute lymphadenitis. The swollen lymph nodes form the characteristic buboes associated with the disease, and autopsies of these buboes have revealed them to be mostly hemorrhagic or necrotic.

If the lymph node is overwhelmed, the infection can pass into the bloodstream, causing &quot;secondary septicemic plague&quot; and if the lungs are seeded, it can cause &quot;secondary pneumonic plague&quot;.

===Septicemic plague===
Lymphatics ultimately drain into the bloodstream, so the plague bacteria may enter the blood and travel to almost any part of the body. In septicemic plague, bacterial endotoxins cause disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), causing tiny clots throughout the body and possibly ischemic necrosis (tissue death due to lack of circulation/perfusion to that tissue) from the clots. DIC results in depletion of the body&#x27;s clotting resources so that it can no longer control bleeding. Consequently, there is bleeding into the skin and other organs, which can cause red and/or black patchy rash and hemoptysis/hematemesis (coughing up/ vomiting of blood). There are bumps on the skin that look somewhat like insect bites; these are usually red, and sometimes white in the centre. Untreated, the septicemic plague is usually fatal. Early treatment with antibiotics reduces the mortality rate to between 4 and 15 per cent.

===Pneumonic plague===

The pneumonic form of plague arises from infection of the lungs. It causes coughing and thereby produces airborne droplets that contain bacterial cells and are likely to infect anyone inhaling them. The incubation period for pneumonic plague is short, usually two to four days, but sometimes just a few hours. The initial signs are indistinguishable from several other respiratory illnesses; they include headache, weakness, and spitting or vomiting of blood. The course of the disease is rapid; unless diagnosed and treated soon enough, typically within a few hours, death may follow in one to six days; in untreated cases, mortality is nearly 100%.

==Cause==
Transmission of &quot;Y. pestis&quot; to an uninfected individual is possible by any of the following means:
* droplet contact – coughing or sneezing on another person
* direct physical contact – touching an infected person, including sexual contact
* indirect contact – usually by touching soil contamination or a contaminated surface
* airborne transmission – if the microorganism can remain in the air for long periods
* fecal-oral transmission – usually from contaminated food or water sources
* vector borne transmission – carried by insects or other animals.
&quot;Yersinia pestis&quot; circulates in animal reservoirs, particularly in rodents, in the natural foci of infection found on all continents except Australia. The natural foci of plague are situated in a broad belt in the tropical and sub-tropical latitudes and the warmer parts of the temperate latitudes around the globe, between the parallels 55° N and 40° S.
Contrary to popular belief, rats did not directly start the spread of the bubonic plague. It is mainly a disease in the fleas (&quot;Xenopsylla cheopis&quot;) that infested the rats, making the rats themselves the first victims of the plague. Rodent-borne infection in a human occurs when a person is bitten by a flea that has been infected by biting a rodent that itself has been infected by the bite of a flea carrying the disease. The bacteria multiply inside the flea, sticking together to form a plug that blocks its stomach and causes it to starve. The flea then bites a host and continues to feed, even though it cannot quell its hunger, and consequently, the flea vomits blood tainted with the bacteria back into the bite wound. The bubonic plague bacterium then infects a new person and the flea eventually dies from starvation. Serious outbreaks of plague are usually started by other disease outbreaks in rodents or a rise in the rodent population.

A 21st-century study of a 1665 outbreak of plague in the village of Eyam in England&#x27;s Derbyshire Dales – which isolated itself during the outbreak, facilitating modern study – found that three-quarters of cases are likely to have been due to human-to-human transmission, especially within families, a much larger proportion than previously thought.

== Diagnosis ==
Symptoms of plague are usually non-specific and to definitively diagnose plague, laboratory testing is required. &quot;Y. pestis&quot; can be identified through both a microscope and by culturing a sample and this is used as a reference standard to confirm that a person has a case of plague. The sample can be obtained from the blood, mucus (sputum), or aspirate extracted from inflamed lymph nodes (buboes). If a person is administered antibiotics before a sample is taken or if there is a delay in transporting the person&#x27;s sample to a laboratory and/or a poorly stored sample, there is a possibility for false negative results.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may also be used to diagnose plague, by detecting the presence of bacterial genes such as the &quot;pla&quot; gene (plasmogen activator) and &quot;caf1&quot; gene, (F1 capsule antigen). PCR testing requires a very small sample and is effective for both alive and dead bacteria. For this reason, if a person receives antibiotics before a sample is collected for laboratory testing, they may have a false negative culture and a positive PCR result.

Blood tests to detect antibodies against &quot;Y. pestis&quot; can also be used to diagnose plague, however, this requires taking blood samples at different periods to detect differences between the acute and convalescent phases of F1 antibody titres.

In 2020, a study about rapid diagnostic tests that detect the F1 capsule antigen (F1RDT) by sampling sputum or bubo aspirate was released. Results show rapid diagnostic F1RDT test can be used for people who have suspected pneumonic and bubonic plague but cannot be used in asymptomatic people. F1RDT may be useful in providing a fast result for prompt treatment and fast public health response as studies suggest that F1RDT is highly sensitive for both pneumonic and bubonic plague. However, when using the rapid test, both positive and negative results need to be confirmed to establish or reject the diagnosis of a confirmed case of plague and the test result needs to be interpreted within the epidemiological context as study findings indicate that although 40 out of 40 people who had the plague in a population of 1000 were correctly diagnosed, 317 people were diagnosed falsely as positive.

==Prevention==
=== Vaccination ===
Bacteriologist Waldemar Haffkine developed the first plague vaccine in 1897. He conducted a massive inoculation program in British India, and it is estimated that 26 million doses of Haffkine&#x27;s anti-plague vaccine were sent out from Bombay between 1897 and 1925, reducing the plague mortality by 50–85%.

Since human plague is rare in most parts of the world as of 2023, routine vaccination is not needed other than for those at particularly high risk of exposure, nor for people living in areas with enzootic plague, meaning it occurs at regular, predictable rates in populations and specific areas, such as the western United States. It is not even indicated for most travellers to countries with known recent reported cases, particularly if their travel is limited to urban areas with modern hotels. The United States CDC thus only recommends vaccination for (1) all laboratory and field personnel who are working with &quot;Y. pestis&quot; organisms resistant to antimicrobials: (2) people engaged in aerosol experiments with &quot;Y. pestis&quot;; and (3) people engaged in field operations in areas with enzootic plague where preventing exposure is not possible (such as some disaster areas). A systematic review by the Cochrane Collaboration found no studies of sufficient quality to make any statement on the efficacy of the vaccine.

=== Early diagnosis ===
Diagnosing plague early leads to a decrease in transmission or spread of the disease.

=== Prophylaxis ===
Pre-exposure prophylaxis for first responders and health care providers who will care for patients with pneumonic plague is not considered necessary as long as standard and droplet precautions can be maintained. In cases of surgical mask shortages, patient overcrowding, poor ventilation in hospital wards, or other crises, pre-exposure prophylaxis might be warranted if sufficient supplies of antimicrobials are available.

Postexposure prophylaxis should be considered for people who had close (&lt;6 feet), sustained contact with a patient with pneumonic plague and were not wearing adequate personal protective equipment. Antimicrobial postexposure prophylaxis also can be considered for laboratory workers accidentally exposed to infectious materials and people who had close (&lt;6 feet) or direct contact with infected animals, such as veterinary staff, pet owners, and hunters.

Specific recommendations on pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis are available in the clinical guidelines on treatment and prophylaxis of plague published in 2021.

==Treatments==
If diagnosed in time, the various forms of plague are usually highly responsive to antibiotic therapy. The antibiotics often used are streptomycin, chloramphenicol and tetracycline. Amongst the newer generation of antibiotics, gentamicin and doxycycline have proven effective in monotherapeutic treatment of plague. Guidelines on treatment and prophylaxis of plague were published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2021.

The plague bacterium could develop drug resistance and again become a major health threat. One case of a drug-resistant form of the bacterium was found in Madagascar in 1995. Further outbreaks in Madagascar were reported in November 2014 and October 2017.

==Epidemiology==
Globally about 600 cases are reported a year. In 2017, the countries with the most cases include the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar and Peru. It has historically occurred in large outbreaks, with the best known being the Black Death in the 14th century which resulted in more than 50 million dead. In recent years, cases have been distributed between small seasonal outbreaks which occur primarily in Madagascar, and sporadic outbreaks or isolated cases in endemic areas.

In 2022 the possible origin of all modern strands of &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot; DNA was found in human remains in three graves located in Kyrgyzstan, dated to 1338 and 1339. The siege of Caffa in Crimea in 1346, is known to have been the first plague outbreak with following strands, later to spread over Europe. Sequencing DNA compared to other ancient and modern strands paints a family tree of the bacteria. Bacteria today affecting marmots in Kyrgyzstan, are closest to the strand found in the graves, suggesting this is also the location where plague transferred from animals to humans.

==Biological weapon==
The plague has a long history as a biological weapon. Historical accounts from ancient China and medieval Europe details the use of infected animal carcasses, such as cows or horses, and human carcasses, by the Xiongnu/Huns, Mongols, Turks and other groups, to contaminate enemy water supplies. Han dynasty general Huo Qubing is recorded to have died of such contamination while engaging in warfare against the Xiongnu. Plague victims were also reported to have been tossed by catapult into cities under siege.

In 1347, the Genoese possession of Caffa, a great trade emporium on the Crimean peninsula, came under siege by an army of Mongol warriors of the Golden Horde under the command of Jani Beg. After a protracted siege during which the Mongol army was reportedly withering from the disease, they decided to use the infected corpses as a biological weapon. The corpses were catapulted over the city walls, infecting the inhabitants. This event might have led to the transfer of the Black Death via their ships into the south of Europe, possibly explaining its rapid spread.

During World War II, the Japanese Army developed weaponized plague, based on the breeding and release of large numbers of fleas. During the Japanese occupation of Manchuria, Unit 731 deliberately infected Chinese, Korean and Manchurian civilians and prisoners of war with the plague bacterium. These subjects, termed &quot;maruta&quot; or &quot;logs&quot;, were then studied by dissection, others by vivisection while still conscious. Members of the unit such as Shiro Ishii were exonerated from the Tokyo tribunal by Douglas MacArthur but 12 of them were prosecuted in the Khabarovsk War Crime Trials in 1949 during which some admitted having spread bubonic plague within a radius around the city of Changde.

Ishii innovated bombs containing live mice and fleas, with very small explosive loads, to deliver the weaponized microbes, overcoming the problem of the explosive killing the infected animal and insect by the use of a ceramic, rather than metal, casing for the warhead. While no records survive of the actual usage of the ceramic shells, prototypes exist and are believed to have been used in experiments during WWII.

After World War II, both the United States and the Soviet Union developed means of weaponising pneumonic plague. Experiments included various delivery methods, vacuum drying, sizing the bacterium, developing strains resistant to antibiotics, combining the bacterium with other diseases (such as diphtheria), and genetic engineering. Scientists who worked in USSR bio-weapons programs have stated that the Soviet effort was formidable and that large stocks of weaponised plague bacteria were produced. Information on many of the Soviet and US projects is largely unavailable. Aerosolized pneumonic plague remains the most significant threat.

The plague can be easily treated with antibiotics. Some countries, such as the United States, have large supplies on hand if such an attack should occur, making the threat less severe.

<text>The Baudot code () is an early character encoding for telegraphy invented by Émile Baudot in the 1870s. It was the predecessor to the International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2 (ITA2), the most common teleprinter code in use before ASCII. Each character in the alphabet is represented by a series of five bits, sent over a communication channel such as a telegraph wire or a radio signal by asynchronous serial communication. The symbol rate measurement is known as baud, and is derived from the same name.

==History==

===Baudot code (ITA1)===

In the below table, Columns I, II, III, IV, and V show the code; the Let. and Fig. columns show the letters and numbers for the Continental and UK versions; and the sort keys present the table in the order: alphabetical, Gray and UK
Baudot developed his first multiplexed telegraph in 1872 and patented it in 1874. In 1876, he changed from a six-bit code to a five-bit code, as suggested by Carl Friedrich Gauss and Wilhelm Weber in 1834,
with equal on and off intervals, which allowed for transmission of the Roman alphabet, and included punctuation and control signals. The code itself was not patented (only the machine) because French patent law does not allow concepts to be patented.

Baudot&#x27;s 5-bit code was adapted to be sent from a manual keyboard, and no teleprinter equipment was ever constructed that used it in its original form. The code was entered on a keyboard which had just five piano-type keys and was operated using two fingers of the left hand and three fingers of the right hand. Once the keys had been pressed, they were locked down until mechanical contacts in a distributor unit passed over the sector connected to that particular keyboard, at which time the keyboard was unlocked ready for the next character to be entered, with an audible click (known as the &quot;cadence signal&quot;) to warn the operator. Operators had to maintain a steady rhythm, and the usual speed of operation was 30 words per minute.

The table &quot;shows the allocation of the Baudot code which was employed in the British Post Office for continental and inland services. A number of characters in the continental code are replaced by fractionals in the inland code. Code elements 1, 2 and 3 are transmitted by keys 1, 2 and 3, and these are operated by the first three fingers of the right hand. Code elements 4 and 5 are transmitted by keys 4 and 5, and these are operated by the first two fingers of the left hand.&quot;

Baudot&#x27;s code became known as the International Telegraph Alphabet No. 1 (ITA1). It is no longer used.

===Murray code===

In 1901, Baudot&#x27;s code was modified by Donald Murray (1865–1945), prompted by his development of a typewriter-like keyboard. The Murray system employed an intermediate step: an operator used a keyboard perforator to punch a paper tape and then a transmitter to send the message from the punched tape. At the receiving end of the line, a printing mechanism would print on a paper tape, and/or a reperforator would make a perforated copy of the message.

Because there was no longer a connection between the operator&#x27;s hand movement and the bits transmitted, there was no concern about arranging the code to minimize operator fatigue. Instead, Murray designed the code to minimize wear on the machinery by assigning the code combinations with the fewest punched holes to the most frequently used characters. For example, the one-hole letters are E and T. The ten two-hole letters are AOINSHRDLZ, very similar to the &quot;Etaoin shrdlu&quot; order used in Linotype machines. Ten more letters, BCGFJMPUWY, have three holes each, and the four-hole letters are VXKQ.

The Murray code also introduced what became known as &quot;format affectors&quot; or &quot;control characters&quot; the CR (Carriage Return) and LF (Line Feed) codes. A few of Baudot&#x27;s codes moved to the positions where they have stayed ever since: the NULL or BLANK and the DEL code. NULL/BLANK was used as an idle code for when no messages were being sent, but the same code was used to encode the space separation between words. Sequences of DEL codes (fully punched columns) were used at start or end of messages or between them which made it easier to separate distinct messages. (BELL codes could be inserted in those sequences to signal to the remote operator that a new message was coming or that transmission of a message was terminated).

Early British Creed machines also used the Murray system.

===Western Union===

Murray&#x27;s code was adopted by Western Union which used it until the 1950s, with a few changes that consisted of omitting some characters and adding more control codes. An explicit SPC (space) character was introduced, in place of the BLANK/NULL, and a new BEL code rang a bell or otherwise produced an audible signal at the receiver. Additionally, the WRU or &quot;Who aRe yoU?&quot; code was introduced, which caused a receiving machine to send an identification stream back to the sender.

In 1932, the CCITT introduced the International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2 (ITA2) code as an international standard, which was based on the Western Union code with some minor changes. The US standardized on a version of ITA2 called the American Teletypewriter code (US TTY) which was the basis for 5-bit teletypewriter codes until the debut of 7-bit ASCII in 1963.

Some code points (marked blue in the table) were reserved for national-specific usage.


The code position assigned to Null was in fact used only for the idle state of teleprinters. During long periods of idle time, the impulse rate was not synchronized between both devices (which could even be powered off or not permanently interconnected on commuted phone lines). To start a message it was first necessary to calibrate the impulse rate, a sequence of regularly timed &quot;mark&quot; pulses (1), by a group of five pulses, which could also be detected by simple passive electronic devices to turn on the teleprinter. This sequence of pulses generated a series of Erasure/Delete characters while also initializing the state of the receiver to the Letters shift mode. However, the first pulse could be lost, so this power on procedure could then be terminated by a single Null immediately followed by an Erasure/Delete character. To preserve the synchronization between devices, the Null code could not be used arbitrarily in the middle of messages (this was an improvement to the initial Baudot system where spaces were not explicitly differentiated, so it was difficult to maintain the pulse counters for repeating spaces on teleprinters). But it was then possible to resynchronize devices at any time by sending a Null in the middle of a message (immediately followed by an Erasure/Delete/LS control if followed by a letter, or by a FS control if followed by a figure). Sending Null controls also did not cause the paper band to advance to the next row (as nothing was punched), so this saved precious lengths of punchable paper band. On the other hand, the Erasure/Delete/LS control code was always punched and always shifted to the (initial) letters mode. According to some sources, the Null code point was reserved for country-internal usage only.

The Shift to Letters code (LS) is also usable as a way to cancel/delete text from a punched tape after it has been read, allowing the safe destruction of a message before discarding the punched band. Functionally, it can also play the same filler role as the Delete code in ASCII (or other 7-bit and 8-bit encodings, including EBCDIC for punched cards). After codes in a fragment of text have been replaced by an arbitrary number of LS codes, what follows is still preserved and decodable. It can also be used as an initiator to make sure that the decoding of the first code will not give a digit or another symbol from the figures page (because the Null code can be arbitrarily inserted near the end or beginning of a punch band, and has to be ignored, whereas the Space code is significant in text).

The cells marked as reserved for extensions (which use the LS code again a second time—just after the first LS code—to shift from the figures page to the letters shift page) has been defined to shift into a new mode. In this new mode, the letters page contains only lowercase letters, but retains access to a third code page for uppercase letters, either by encoding for a single letter (by sending LS before that letter), or locking (with FS+LS) for an unlimited number of capital letters or digits before then unlocking (with a single LS) to return to lowercase mode. The cell marked as &quot;Reserved&quot; is also usable (using the FS code from the figures shift page) to switch the page of figures (which normally contains digits and &quot;national&quot; lowercase letters or symbols) to a fourth page (where national letters are uppercase and other symbols may be encoded).

ITA2 is still used in telecommunications devices for the deaf (TDD), Telex, and some amateur radio applications, such as radioteletype (&quot;RTTY&quot;). ITA2 is also used in Enhanced Broadcast Solution, an early 21st-century financial protocol specified by Deutsche Börse, to reduce the character encoding footprint.

==Nomenclature==
Nearly all 20th-century teleprinter equipment used Western Union&#x27;s code, ITA2, or variants thereof. Radio amateurs casually call ITA2 and variants &quot;Baudot&quot; incorrectly, and even the American Radio Relay League&#x27;s Amateur Radio Handbook does so, though in more recent editions the tables of codes correctly identifies it as ITA2.

==Details==

Note: This table presumes the space called &quot;1&quot; by Baudot and Murray is rightmost, and least significant. The way the transmitted bits were packed into larger codes varied by manufacturer. The most common solution allocates the bits from the least significant bit towards the most significant bit (leaving the three most significant bits of a byte unused).

In ITA2, characters are expressed using five bits. ITA2 uses two code sub-sets, the &quot;letter shift&quot; (LTRS), and the &quot;figure shift&quot; (FIGS). The FIGS character (11011) signals that the following characters are to be interpreted as being in the FIGS set, until this is reset by the LTRS (11111) character. In use, the LTRS or FIGS shift key is pressed and released, transmitting the corresponding shift character to the other machine. The desired letters or figures characters are then typed. Unlike a typewriter or modern computer keyboard, the shift key isn&#x27;t kept depressed whilst the corresponding characters are typed. &quot;ENQuiry&quot; will trigger the other machine&#x27;s answerback. It means &quot;Who are you?&quot;

CR is carriage return, LF is line feed, BEL is the bell character which rang a small bell (often used to alert operators to an incoming message), SP is space, and NUL is the null character (blank tape).

Note: the binary conversions of the codepoints are often shown in reverse order, depending on (presumably) from which side one views the paper tape. Note further that the &quot;control&quot; characters were chosen so that they were either symmetric or in useful pairs so that inserting a tape &quot;upside down&quot; did not result in problems for the equipment and the resulting printout could be deciphered. Thus FIGS (11011), LTRS (11111) and space (00100) are invariant, while CR (00010) and LF (01000), generally used as a pair, are treated the same regardless of order by page printers. LTRS could also be used to overpunch characters to be deleted on a paper tape (much like DEL in 7-bit ASCII).

The sequence &quot;RYRYRY...&quot; is often used in test messages, and at the start of every transmission. Since R is 01010 and Y is 10101, the sequence exercises much of a teleprinter&#x27;s mechanical components at maximum stress. Also, at one time, fine-tuning of the receiver was done using two coloured lights (one for each tone). &#x27;RYRYRY...&#x27; produced 0101010101..., which made the lights glow with equal brightness when the tuning was correct. This tuning sequence is only useful when ITA2 is used with two-tone FSK modulation, such as is commonly seen in radioteletype (RTTY) usage.

US implementations of Baudot code may differ in the addition of a few characters, such as #, &amp; on the FIGS layer.

The Russian version of Baudot code (MTK-2) used three shift modes; the Cyrillic letter mode was activated by the character (00000). Because of the larger number of characters in the Cyrillic alphabet, the characters !, &amp;, £ were omitted and replaced by Cyrillics, and BEL has the same code as Cyrillic letter Ю. The Cyrillic letters Ъ and Ё are omitted, and Ч is merged with the numeral 4.

<doc id="4749" wikidata="Q632702" url="?curid=4749" title="Blu Tack">
<text>Blu Tack is a reusable putty-like pressure-sensitive adhesive produced by Bostik, commonly used to attach lightweight objects (such as posters or sheets of paper) to walls, doors or other dry surfaces. Traditionally blue, it is also available in other colours. Generic versions of the product are also available from other manufacturers. The spelling now used is without a hyphen.

As of 2015, Bostik was manufacturing around 100 tonnes of Blu Tack weekly at its Leicester factory.

== History ==

While the inventor of the commercial Bostik product is unknown, a precursor was created around 1970 as an accidental by-product of an attempt to develop a sealant based on chalk powder, rubber and oil. Blu Tack was originally white, but following fears that children could mistake it for chewing gum, a blue colouring was added.

In the United Kingdom in March 2008, 20,000 numbered packs of pink Blu Tack were made available, to help raise money for Breast Cancer Campaign, with 10 pence from each pack going to the charity. The formulation was slightly altered to retain complete consistency with its blue counterpart. Since then, many coloured variations have been made, including red-and-white, yellow, and a green Halloween pack.

== Composition ==
Blu Tack is described as a synthetic rubber compound without hazardous properties under normal conditions. It can be swallowed without harm and is not carcinogenic. It is non-soluble and is denser than water. The material is not flammable, but emits carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide when exposed to fire or high temperatures.

== Similar products ==
Similar products of various colours are made by many manufacturers, including Faber-Castell&#x27;s &quot;Tack-it&quot;, Henkel&#x27;s &quot;Fun-Tak&quot;, UHU&#x27;s &quot;Poster Putty&quot; and &quot;Sticky Tack&quot;, UFO&#x27;s &quot;Dough Tack&quot;, &quot;Gummy Sticker&quot; Pritt&#x27;s &quot;Sticky Stuff&quot;, Bostik&#x27;s &quot;Prestik&quot; and Elmer&#x27;s &quot;Poster Tack&quot;. Plasti-Tak by Brooks Manufacturing Company appears to pre-date Blu Tack, with a trademark registration in 1964.

Versions of the product are also sold under the generic names &quot;adhesive putty&quot; and &quot;mounting putty&quot;. The generic trademark or common name for mounting putty varies by region. It is known as &quot;Patafix&quot; in France, Italy, Portugal, Austria and Turkey, &#x27; in Iceland and &quot;lærertyggis&quot; in Norway (both meaning &quot;teacher&#x27;s chewing gum&quot;), &#x27; (&quot;attachment paste&quot;) or &#x27; in Sweden, and &#x27; in South Africa (an Afrikaans word, literally translated as &quot;wonder glue&quot;).

== Alternative uses ==
Like all poster putties, Blu Tack provides an alternative to the artist&#x27;s traditional kneaded eraser.

Blu Tack was often used with the Sinclair ZX81 microcomputer to help mitigate crashes caused by wobbly external RAM modules. This was such a widespread problem that Sinclair Research&#x27;s technical support department officially recommended the use of Blu Tack to resolve this issue.

In 2007 the artist Elizabeth Thompson created a sculpture of a house spider using Blu Tack over a wire frame. It was exhibited at London Zoo.

Blu Tack can be used as a damping agent for sound and vibration applications, due to its low amplitude response properties. A 2013 study concluded that the substance is a comfortable alternative to over-the-counter ear plugs for the attenuation of everyday sound.

The New Zealand Government Earthquake Commission recommends that products such as Blu Tack should be used to prevent ornaments and small household items from falling or moving in the event of an earthquake.

Blu Tack is sometimes used by electronic hobbyists to hold through-hole electronic components in position for soldering onto PC-boards.

<doc id="4751" wikidata="Q212032" url="?curid=4751" title="Bacillus">
<text>Bacillus (Latin &quot;stick&quot;) is a genus of Gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria, a member of the phylum &quot;Bacillota&quot;, with 266 named species. The term is also used to describe the shape (rod) of other so-shaped bacteria; and the plural &quot;Bacilli&quot; is the name of the class of bacteria to which this genus belongs. &quot;Bacillus&quot; species can be either obligate aerobes which are dependent on oxygen, or facultative anaerobes which can survive in the absence of oxygen. Cultured &quot;Bacillus&quot; species test positive for the enzyme catalase if oxygen has been used or is present.

&quot;Bacillus&quot; can reduce themselves to oval endospores and can remain in this dormant state for years. The endospore of one species from Morocco is reported to have survived being heated to 420 °C. Endospore formation is usually triggered by a lack of nutrients: the bacterium divides within its cell wall, and one side then engulfs the other. They are not true spores (i.e., not an offspring). Endospore formation originally defined the genus, but not all such species are closely related, and many species have been moved to other genera of the &quot;Bacillota&quot;. Only one endospore is formed per cell. The spores are resistant to heat, cold, radiation, desiccation, and disinfectants. &quot;Bacillus anthracis&quot; needs oxygen to sporulate; this constraint has important consequences for epidemiology and control. In vivo, &quot;B. anthracis&quot; produces a polypeptide (polyglutamic acid) capsule that kills it from phagocytosis. The genera &quot;Bacillus&quot; and &quot;Clostridium&quot; constitute the family &quot;Bacillaceae&quot;. Species are identified by using morphologic and biochemical criteria. Because the spores of many &quot;Bacillus&quot; species are resistant to heat, radiation, disinfectants, and desiccation, they are difficult to eliminate from medical and pharmaceutical materials and are a frequent cause of contamination. Not only are they resistant to heat, radiation, etc., but they are also resistant to chemicals such as antibiotics. This resistance allows them to survive for many years and especially in a controlled environment. &quot;Bacillus&quot; species are well known in the food industries as troublesome spoilage organisms.

Ubiquitous in nature, &quot;Bacillus&quot; includes symbiotic (sometimes referred to as endophytes) as well as independent species. Two species are medically significant: &quot;B. anthracis&quot; causes anthrax; and &quot;B. cereus&quot; causes food poisoning.

Many species of &quot;Bacillus&quot; can produce copious amounts of enzymes, which are used in various industries, such as in the production of alpha amylase used in starch hydrolysis and the protease subtilisin used in detergents. &quot;B. subtilis&quot; is a valuable model for bacterial research. Some &quot;Bacillus&quot; species can synthesize and secrete lipopeptides, in particular surfactins and mycosubtilins. &quot;Bacillus&quot; species are also found in marine sponges. Marine sponge associated &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; (strains WS1A and YBS29) can synthesize several antimicrobial peptides. These &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; strains can develop disease resistance in &quot;Labeo rohita&quot;.

==Structure==
=== Cell wall ===

The cell wall of &quot;Bacillus&quot; is a structure on the outside of the cell that forms the second barrier between the bacterium and the environment, and at the same time maintains the rod shape and withstands the pressure generated by the cell&#x27;s turgor. The cell wall is made of teichoic and teichuronic acids. &quot;B. subtilis&quot; is the first bacterium for which the role of an actin-like cytoskeleton in cell shape determination and peptidoglycan synthesis was identified and for which the entire set of peptidoglycan-synthesizing enzymes was localized. The role of the cytoskeleton in shape generation and maintenance is important.

&quot;Bacillus&quot; species are rod-shaped, endospore-forming aerobic or facultatively anaerobic, Gram-positive bacteria; in some species cultures may turn Gram-negative with age. The many species of the genus exhibit a wide range of physiologic abilities that allow them to live in every natural environment. Only one endospore is formed per cell. The spores are resistant to heat, cold, radiation, desiccation, and disinfectants.

== Origin of name ==
The genus &quot;Bacillus&quot; was named in 1835 by Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg, to contain rod-shaped (bacillus) bacteria. He had seven years earlier named the genus &quot;Bacterium&quot;. &quot;Bacillus&quot; was later amended by Ferdinand Cohn to further describe them as spore-forming, Gram-positive, aerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacteria. Like other genera associated with the early history of microbiology, such as &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; and &quot;Vibrio&quot;, the 266 species of &quot;Bacillus&quot; are ubiquitous. The genus has a very large ribosomal 16S diversity.

==Isolation and identification==
Established methods for isolating &quot;Bacillus&quot; species for culture primarily involve suspension of sampled soil in distilled water, heat shock to kill off vegetative cells leaving primarily viable spores in the sample, and culturing on agar plates with further tests to confirm the identity of the cultured colonies. Additionally, colonies which exhibit characteristics typical of &quot;Bacillus&quot; bacteria can be selected from a culture of an environmental sample which has been significantly diluted following heat shock or hot air drying to select potential &quot;Bacillus&quot; bacteria for testing.

Cultured colonies are usually large, spreading, and irregularly shaped. Under the microscope, the &quot;Bacillus&quot; cells appear as rods, and a substantial portion of the cells usually contain oval endospores at one end, making them bulge.

== Characteristics of &quot;Bacillus&quot; spp. ==
S.I. Paul et al. (2021) isolated and identified multiple strains of &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; (strains WS1A, YBS29, KSP163A, OA122, ISP161A, OI6, WS11, KSP151E, and S8,) from marine sponges of the Saint Martin&#x27;s Island Area of the Bay of Bengal, Bangladesh. Based on their study, colony, morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics of &quot;Bacillus&quot; spp. are shown in the Table below.

It&#x27;s been long known that the (pre-2020) definition of &quot;Bacillus&quot; is overly vague.
* Xu and Côté (2003) uses 16S and ITS rRNA regions to divide the genus &quot;Bacillus&quot; into 10 groups, including the nested genera &quot;Paenibacillus&quot;, &quot;Brevibacillus&quot;, &quot;Geobacillus&quot;, &quot;Marinibacillus&quot; and &quot;Virgibacillus&quot;.
* Ash and Carol (2008) also uses 16S rRNA and found extensive &quot;phylogenetic heterogenity&quot;. 
* &#x27;The All-Species Living Tree&#x27; Project, which has been in operation since 2008, also maintains a 16S (and 23S if available) tree of all validated species. In this tree, the genus &quot;Bacillus&quot; contains a very large number of nested taxa and majorly in both 16S and 23S. It is paraphyletic to the Lactobacillales (&quot;Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Listeria&quot;, etc.), due to &quot;Bacillus coahuilensis&quot; and others.
* Alcaraz &quot;et al.&quot; 2010 presents a gene concatenation study, which found results similar to the All-Species Living Tree, but with a much more limited number of species in terms of groups. (This scheme used &quot;Listeria&quot; as an outgroup, so in light of the ARB tree, it may be &quot;inside-out&quot;).
* Gupta &quot;et al.&quot; 2020 and Patel &quot;et al.&quot; 2020 use phylogenomics and comparative genomics to resolve the structure in &quot;Bacillus&quot; sensu lato. They propose (and validly publish) a number of new genus names, thereby restricting &quot;Bacillus&quot; has been restricted to only include species closely related to &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; and &quot;Bacillus cereus.&quot; (This does not make the genus monophyletic, however: a number of nested genera persists between the two groups.) The newly-created genera are: &quot;Peribacillus&quot;, &quot;Cytobacillus&quot;, &quot;Mesobacillus&quot;, &quot;Neobacillus&quot;, &quot;Metabacillus&quot;, &quot;Alkalihalobacillus&quot;, &quot;Alteribacter&quot;, &quot;Ectobacillus&quot;, &quot;Evansella&quot;, &quot;Ferdinandcohnia&quot;, &quot;Gottfriedia&quot;, &quot;Heyndrickxia&quot;, &quot;Lederbergia&quot;, &quot;Litchfieldia&quot;, &quot;Margalitia&quot;, &quot;Niallia&quot;, &quot;Priestia&quot;, &quot;Robertmurraya&quot;, &quot;Rossellomorea&quot;, &quot;Schinkia&quot;, &quot;Siminovitchia&quot;, &quot;Sutcliffiella&quot; and &quot;Weizmannia&quot;.
* Nikolaidis &quot;et al.&quot; 2022 studied 1104 &quot;Bacillus&quot; proteomes using a gene concatenation based on 114 core proteins and delineated the relationships among the various species, defined as &quot;Bacillus&quot; from the NCBI taxonomy. The various strains were clustered into species, based on Average Nucleotide identity (ANI) values, with a species cutoff of 95%.

One clade, formed by &quot;Bacillus anthracis&quot;, &quot;Bacillus cereus&quot;, &quot;Bacillus mycoides&quot;, &quot;Bacillus pseudomycoides&quot;, &quot;Bacillus thuringiensis&quot;, and &quot;Bacillus weihenstephanensis&quot; under the 2011 classification standards, should be a single species (within 97% 16S identity), but for medical reasons, they are considered separate species (an issue also present for four species of &quot;Shigella&quot; and &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;).

== Ecological and clinical significance ==
&quot;Bacillus&quot; species are ubiquitous in nature, e.g. in soil. They can occur in extreme environments such as high pH (&quot;B. alcalophilus&quot;), high temperature (&quot;B. thermophilus&quot;), and high salt concentrations (&quot;B. halodurans&quot;). They also are very commonly found as endophytes in plants where they can play a critical role in their immune system, nutrient absorption and nitrogen fixing capabilities. &quot;B. thuringiensis&quot; produces a toxin that can kill insects and thus has been used as insecticide. &quot;B. siamensis&quot; has antimicrobial compounds that inhibit plant pathogens, such as the fungi &quot;Rhizoctonia solani&quot; and &quot;Botrytis cinerea&quot;, and they promote plant growth by volatile emissions. Some species of &quot;Bacillus&quot; are naturally competent for DNA uptake by transformation.
* Two &quot;Bacillus&quot; species are medically significant: &quot;B. anthracis&quot;, which causes anthrax; and &quot;B. cereus&quot;, which causes food poisoning, with symptoms similar to that caused by &quot;Staphylococcus&quot;.
** &quot;B. cereus&quot; produces toxins which cause two different set of symptoms:
*** emetic toxin which can cause vomiting and nausea
*** diarrhea
* &quot;B. thuringiensis&quot; is an important insect pathogen, and is sometimes used to control insect pests.
* &quot;B. subtilis&quot; is an important model organism. It is also a notable food spoiler, causing ropiness in bread and related food.
** &quot;B. subtilis&quot; can also produce and secrete antibiotics.
* Some environmental and commercial strains of &quot;B. coagulans&quot; may play a role in food spoilage of highly acidic, tomato-based products.

==Industrial significance==
Many &quot;Bacillus&quot; species are able to secrete large quantities of enzymes. &quot;Bacillus amyloliquefaciens&quot; is the source of a natural antibiotic protein barnase (a ribonuclease), alpha amylase used in starch hydrolysis, the protease subtilisin used with detergents, and the BamH1 restriction enzyme used in DNA research.

A portion of the &quot;Bacillus thuringiensis&quot; genome was incorporated into corn and cotton crops. The resulting plants are resistant to some insect pests.

&quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; (natto) is the key microbial participant in the ongoing production of the soya-based traditional natto fermentation, and some &quot;Bacillus&quot; species are on the Food and Drug Administration&#x27;s GRAS (generally regarded as safe) list.

The capacity of selected &quot;Bacillus&quot; strains to produce and secrete large quantities (20–25 g/L) of extracellular enzymes has placed them among the most important industrial enzyme producers. The ability of different species to ferment in the acid, neutral, and alkaline pH ranges, combined with the presence of thermophiles in the genus, has led to the development of a variety of new commercial enzyme products with the desired temperature, pH activity, and stability properties to address a variety of specific applications. Classical mutation and (or) selection techniques, together with advanced cloning and protein engineering strategies, have been exploited to develop these products.

Efforts to produce and secrete high yields of foreign recombinant proteins in &quot;Bacillus&quot; hosts initially appeared to be hampered by the degradation of the products by the host proteases. Recent studies have revealed that the slow folding of heterologous proteins at the membrane-cell wall interface of Gram-positive bacteria renders them vulnerable to attack by wall-associated proteases. In addition, the presence of thiol-disulphide oxidoreductases in &quot;B. subtilis&quot; may be beneficial in the secretion of disulphide-bond-containing proteins. Such developments from our understanding of the complex protein translocation machinery of Gram-positive bacteria should allow the resolution of current secretion challenges and make &quot;Bacillus&quot; species preeminent hosts for heterologous protein production.

&quot;Bacillus&quot; strains have also been developed and engineered as industrial producers of nucleotides, the vitamin riboflavin, the flavor agent ribose, and the supplement poly-gamma-glutamic acid. With the recent characterization of the genome of &quot;B. subtilis&quot; 168 and of some related strains, &quot;Bacillus&quot; species are poised to become the preferred hosts for the production of many new and improved products as we move through the genomic and proteomic era.

==Use as model organism==

&quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; is one of the best understood prokaryotes, in terms of molecular and cellular biology. Its superb genetic amenability and relatively large size have provided the powerful tools required to investigate a bacterium from all possible aspects. Recent improvements in fluorescent microscopy techniques have provided novel insight into the dynamic structure of a single cell organism. Research on &quot;B. subtilis&quot; has been at the forefront of bacterial molecular biology and cytology, and the organism is a model for differentiation, gene/protein regulation, and cell cycle events in bacteria.

<text>Brasília ( , ) is the federal capital of Brazil and the seat of government of the Federal District. Located in the Brazilian highlands in the country&#x27;s Central-West region, it was founded by President Juscelino Kubitschek on 21 April 1960, to replace Rio de Janeiro as the national capital. Brasília is Brazil&#x27;s third-most populous city after São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, with a population of 2.8 million. Among major Latin American cities, it has the highest GDP per capita.

Brasília is a planned city developed by Lúcio Costa, Oscar Niemeyer and Joaquim Cardozo in 1956 in a scheme to move the capital from Rio de Janeiro to a more central location. The landscape architect was Roberto Burle Marx. The city&#x27;s design divides it into numbered blocks as well as sectors for specified activities, such as the Hotel Sector, the Banking Sector, and the Embassy Sector. Brasília was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987 due to its modernist architecture and uniquely artistic urban planning. It was named &quot;City of Design&quot; by UNESCO in October 2017 and has been part of the Creative Cities Network since then.

It is notable for its white-colored, modern architecture, designed by Oscar Niemeyer. All three branches of Brazil&#x27;s federal government are located in the city: executive, legislative and judiciary. Brasília also hosts 124 foreign embassies. The city&#x27;s international airport connects it to all other major Brazilian cities and some international destinations, and it is the third-busiest airport in Brazil. It was one of the main host cities of the 2014 FIFA World Cup and hosted some of the football matches during the 2016 Summer Olympics; it also hosted the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup.

Laid out in the shape of an airplane, its &quot;fuselage&quot; is the Monumental Axis, a pair of wide avenues flanking a large park. In the &quot;cockpit&quot; is Praça dos Três Poderes, named for the 3 branches of government surrounding it. Brasília has a unique legal status, as it is an administrative region rather than a municipality like other cities in Brazil. The name &quot;Brasília&quot; is often used as a synonym for the Federal District as a whole, which is divided into 35 administrative regions, one of which (Plano Piloto) includes the area of the originally planned city and its federal government buildings. The entire Federal District is considered by IBGE to make up Brasília&#x27;s city area, and the local government considers the entirety of the district plus 12 neighboring municipalities in the state of Goiás to be its metropolitan area.

== Etymology ==
The term Brasília comes from the Latin translation of Brazil, which was suggested as a name for the country&#x27;s capital in 1821 by José Bonifácio de Andrada e Silva.

==History==
=== Background ===

Brazil&#x27;s first capital was Salvador; in 1763 Rio de Janeiro became Brazil&#x27;s capital and remained so until 1960. During this period, resources tended to be centered in Brazil&#x27;s southeastern region, and most of the country&#x27;s population was concentrated near its Atlantic coast. Brasilia&#x27;s geographically central location fostered a more regionally neutral federal capital. An article of the country&#x27;s first republican constitution, dated 1891, states that the capital should be moved from Rio de Janeiro to a place close to the country&#x27;s center.

The idea of relocating Brazil&#x27;s capital city was conceived in 1827 by José Bonifácio, an advisor to Emperor Pedro I. He presented a plan to the General Assembly of Brazil for a new city called Brasília, with the idea of moving the capital westward from the heavily populated southeastern corridor. The bill was not enacted because Pedro I dissolved the Assembly.

According to a legend, Italian saint Don Bosco in 1883 had a dream in which he described a futuristic city that roughly fitted Brasília&#x27;s location. In Brasília today, many references to Bosco, who founded the Salesian order, are found throughout the city and one church parish in the city bears his name.

=== Costa plan ===
Juscelino Kubitschek was elected President of Brazil in 1955. Upon taking office in January 1956, in fulfilment of his campaign pledge, he initiated the planning and construction of the new capital. The following year an international jury selected Lúcio Costa&#x27;s plan to guide the construction of Brazil&#x27;s new capital, Brasília. Costa was a student of the famous modernist architect Le Corbusier, and some of modernism&#x27;s architecture features can be found in his plan. Costa&#x27;s plan was not as detailed as some of the plans presented by other architects and city planners. It did not include land use schedules, models, population charts or mechanical drawings; however, it was chosen by five out of six jurors because it had the features required to align the growth of a capital city. Even though the initial plan was transformed over time, it oriented much of the construction and most of its features survived.

Brasília&#x27;s accession as the new capital and its designation for the development of an extensive interior region inspired the symbolism of the plan. Costa used a cross-axial design indicating the possession and conquest of this new place with a cross, often likened to a dragonfly, an airplane or a bird. Costa&#x27;s plan included two principal components, the Monumental Axis (east to west) and the Residential Axis (north to south). The Monumental Axis was assigned political and administrative activities, and is considered the body of the city with the style and simplicity of its buildings, oversized scales, and broad vistas and heights, producing the idea of Monumentality. This axis includes the various ministries, national congress, presidential palace, supreme court building and the television and radio tower. The Residential Axis was intended to contain areas with intimate character and is considered the most important achievement of the plan; it was designed for housing and associated functions such as local commerce, schooling, recreation and churches, constituted of 96 limited to six-story buildings and 12 additional superblocks limited to three-story buildings; Costa&#x27;s intention with superblocks was to have small self-contained and self-sufficient neighborhoods and uniform buildings with apartments of two or three different categories, where he envisioned the integration of upper and middle classes sharing the same residential area.

The urban design of the communal apartment blocks was based on Le Corbusier&#x27;s Ville Radieuse of 1935, and the superblocks on the North American Radburn layout from 1929. Visually, the blocks were intended to appear absorbed by the landscape because they were isolated by a belt of tall trees and lower vegetation. Costa attempted to introduce a Brazil that was more equitable, he also designed housing for the working classes that was separated from the upper- and middle-class housing and was visually different, with the intention of avoiding slums (&quot;favelas&quot;) in the urban periphery. The has been accused of being a space where individuals are oppressed and alienated to a form of spatial segregation.

One of the main objectives of the plan was to allow the free flow of automobile traffic, the plan included lanes of traffic in a north–south direction (seven for each direction) for the Monumental Axis and three arterials (the W3, the Eixo and the L2) for the residential Axis; the cul-de-sac access roads of the superblocks were planned to be the end of the main flow of traffic. And the reason behind the heavy emphasis on automobile traffic is the architect&#x27;s desire to establish the concept of modernity in every level.

Though automobiles were invented prior to the 20th century, mass production of vehicles in the early 20th made them widely available; thus, they became a symbol of modernity. The two small axes around the Monumental axis provide loops and exits for cars to enter small roads. Some argue that his emphasis of the plan on automobiles caused the lengthening of distances between centers and it attended only the necessities of a small segment of the population who owned cars. But one can not ignore the bus transportation system in the city. The buses routes inside the city operate heavily on W3 and L2. Almost anywhere, including satellite cities, can be reached just by taking the bus and most of the Plano Piloto can be reached without transferring to other buses.

Later, as the population of the city increased, the transportation system also played an important role in mediating the relationship between the Pilot plan and the satellite cities. Due to the larger influx of vehicles, traffic lights were introduced to the Monumental Axis, which violates the concept of modernity and advancement the architect first employed. Additionally, the metro system in Brasília was mainly built for inhabitants of satellite cities. Though this growth has made Brasília no longer a pure utopia with incomparable modernity, the later development of traffic management, bus routes to satellite cities, and the metro system all serve as a remedy to the dystopia, enabling the citizens to enjoy the kind of modernity that was not carefully planned.

At the intersection of the Monumental and Residential Axis Costa planned the city center with the transportation center (Rodoviaria), the banking sector and the hotel sector, near to the city center, he proposed an amusement center with theaters, cinemas and restaurants. Costa&#x27;s Plan is seen as a plan with a sectoral tendency, segregating all the banks, the office buildings, and the amusement center.

One of the main features of Costa&#x27;s plan was that he presented a new city with its future shape and patterns evident from the beginning. This meant that the original plan included paving streets that were not immediately put into use; the advantage of this was that the original plan is hard to undo because he provided for an entire street network, but on the other hand, is difficult to adapt and mold to other circumstances in the future. In addition, there has been controversy with the monumental aspect of Lúcio Costa&#x27;s Plan, because it appeared to some as 19th century city planning, not modern 20th century in urbanism.

An interesting analysis can be made of Brasília within the context of Cold War politics and the association of Lúcio Costa&#x27;s plan to the symbolism of aviation. From an architectural perspective, the airplane-shaped plan was certainly an homage to Le Corbusier and his enchantment with the aircraft as an architectural masterpiece. However, Brasília was constructed soon after the end of World War II. Despite Brazil&#x27;s minor participation in the conflict, the airplane shape of the city was key in envisioning the country as part of the newly globalized world, together with the victorious Allies. Furthermore, Brasília is a unique example of modernism both as a guideline for architectural design but also as a principle for organizing society. Modernism in Brasília is explored in James Holston&#x27;s book, &quot;The Modernist City&quot;.

=== Construction ===
Juscelino Kubitschek, president of Brazil from 1956 to 1961, ordered Brasília&#x27;s construction, fulfilling the promise of the Constitution and his own political campaign promise. Building Brasília was part of Juscelino&#x27;s &quot;fifty years of prosperity in five&quot; plan. Already in 1892, the astronomer Louis Cruls, in the service of the Brazilian government, had investigated the site for the future capital. Lúcio Costa won a contest and was the main urban planner in 1957, with 5550 people competing. Oscar Niemeyer was the chief architect of most public buildings, Joaquim Cardozo was the structural engineer, and Roberto Burle Marx was the landscape designer. Brasília was built in 41 months, from 1956 to 21 April 1960, when it was officially inaugurated.

==Geography==

The city sits at an elevation of and more, high on the Brazilian Highlands in the country&#x27;s center-western region. Paranoá Lake, a large artificial lake, was built to increase the amount of water available and to maintain the region&#x27;s humidity. It has a marina, and hosts wakeboarders and windsurfers. Diving can also be practiced and one of the main attractions is Vila Amaury, an old village submerged in the lake. This is where the first construction workers of Brasília used to live.

===Climate===
Brasília has a tropical savanna climate (&quot;Aw&quot;, according to the Köppen climate classification), milder due to the elevation and with two distinct seasons: the rainy season, from October to April, and the dry season, from May to September. The average temperature is . September, at the end of the dry season, has the highest average maximum temperature, , and July has major and minor lower maximum average temperature, of and , respectively. Average temperatures from September through March are a consistent . With , November is the month with the highest rainfall of the year, while July is the lowest, with only . During the dry season, the city can have very low relative humidity levels, often below 30%.

According to the Brazilian National Institute of Meteorology (INMET), the record low temperature was on 18 July 1975, and the record high was on 18 October 2015 and 8 October 2020. The highest accumulated rainfall in 24 hours was on 15 November 1963.

==Demographics==

===Ethnic groups===
According to the 2022 IBGE Census, 2,817,381 people resided in Brasília and its metropolitan area, of whom 1,370,836 were Mixed (48.7%), 1,126,334 White (40%), 301,765 Black (10.7%), 12,810 Asian (0.5%), and 5,536 Amerindian (0.1%).

In 2010, Brasília was ranked the fourth-most populous city in Brazil after São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Salvador. In 2010, the city had 474,871 opposite-sex couples and 1,241 same-sex couples. The population of Brasília was 52.2% female and 47.8% male.

In the 1960 census there were almost 140,000 residents in the new Federal district. By 1970 this figure had grown to 537,000. By 2010 the population of the Federal District had surpassed 2,5 million. The city of Brasília proper, the plano piloto was planned for about 500,000 inhabitants, a figure the plano piloto never surpassed, with a current population of only 214,529, but its metropolitan area within the Federal District has grown past this figure.

From the beginning, the growth of Brasília was greater than original estimates. According to the original plans, Brasília would be a city for government authorities and staff. However, during its construction, Brazilians from all over the country migrated to the satellite cities of Brasília, seeking public and private employment.

At the close of the 20th century, Brasília was the largest city in the world which had not existed at the beginning of the century. Brasília has one of the highest population growth rates in Brazil, with annual growth of 2.82%, mostly due to internal migration.

Brasília&#x27;s inhabitants include a foreign population of mostly embassy workers as well as large numbers of Brazilian internal migrants. Today, the city has important communities of immigrants and refugees. The city&#x27;s Human Development Index was 0.936 in 2000 (developed level), and the city&#x27;s literacy rate was around 95.65%.

===Religion===
Christianity is by far the most prevalent religion in Brasília, with Roman Catholicism being the largest denomination.
&quot;Source: IBGE 2010. &quot;

== Government ==
Brasília does not have a mayor or councillors, because article 32 of the Constitution of Brazil expressly prohibits the Federal District being divided into municipalities.

The Federal District is a legal entity of internal public law, which is part of the political-administrative structure of Brazil of a &quot;sui generis&quot; nature, because it is neither a state nor a municipality, but rather a special entity that incorporates the legislative powers reserved to the states and municipalities, as provided in Article 32, § 1º of the Constitution, which gives it a hybrid nature, both state and municipal.

The executive power of the Federal District was represented by the mayor of the Federal District until 1969, when the position was transformed into governor of the Federal District.

The legislative power of the Federal District is represented by the Legislative Chamber of the Federal District, whose nomenclature includes a mixture of legislative assembly (legislative power of the other units of the federation) and of municipal chamber (legislative of the municipalities). The Legislative Chamber is made up of 24 district deputies.
The judicial power which serves the Federal District also serves federal territories as it is constituted, but Brazil does not have any territories. Therefore, the Court of Justice of the Federal District and of the Territories only serves the Federal District.

Part of the budget of the Federal District Government comes from the Constitutional Fund of the Federal District. In 2012, the fund totaled 9.6 billion reais. By 2015, the forecast is 12.4 billion reais, of which more than half (6.4 billion) is spent on public security spending.

=== International relations ===

Of these, Abuja and Washington, D.C. were also cities specifically planned as the seat of government of their respective countries.

;Brasília Declarations
Brasília is associated with several significant declarations in the international political and social field, including:
*The Brasília Declaration of the IBSA Dialogue Forum (2003), signed by the foreign ministers of India, Brazil and South Africa (IBSA) regarding representation at the United Nations Security Council
*Brasília Declaration on the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons in the Americas (2010)

*The 15th Conference of Defense Ministers of the Americas, meeting in Brasília in 2022, issued a Declaration condemning Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine.

==Economy==


The major roles of construction and of services (government, communications, banking and finance, food production, entertainment, and legal services) in Brasília&#x27;s economy reflect the city&#x27;s status as a governmental rather than an industrial center. Industries connected with construction, food processing, and furnishings are important, as are those associated with publishing, printing, and computer software. The gross domestic product (GDP) is divided in Public Administration 54.8%, Services 28.7%, Industry 10.2%, Commerce 6.1%, Agrobusiness 0.2%.

Besides being the political center, Brasília is an important economic center. In 2018, it has the third highest GDP of cities in Brazil, R$254 billion reais, representing 3.6% of the total Brazilian GDP. Most economic activity in the federal capital results from its administrative function. Its industrial planning is studied carefully by the Government of the Federal District. Being a city registered by UNESCO, the government in Brasília has opted to encourage the development of non-polluting industries such as software, film, video, and gemology among others, with emphasis on environmental preservation and maintaining ecological balance, preserving the city property.

According to Mercer&#x27;s city rankings of cost of living for expatriate employees, Brasília ranks 45th among the most expensive cities in the world in 2012, up from the 70th position in 2010, ranking behind São Paulo (12th) and Rio de Janeiro (13th).

===Industries===
Industries in the city include construction (Paulo Octavio, Via Construções, and Irmãos Gravia among others); food processing (Perdigão, Sadia); furniture making; recycling (Novo Rio, Rexam, Latasa and others); pharmaceuticals (União Química); and graphic industries. The main agricultural products produced in the city are coffee, guavas, strawberries, oranges, lemons, papayas, soybeans, and mangoes. It has over 110,000 cows and it exports wood products worldwide.

The Federal District, where Brasília is located, has a GDP of R$133,4 billion (about US$64.1 billion), about the same as Belarus according to The Economist. Its share of the total Brazilian GDP is about 3.8%. The Federal District has the largest GDP per capita income of Brazil US$25,062, slightly higher than Belarus.

The city&#x27;s planned design included specific areas for almost everything, including accommodation, Hotels Sectors North and South. New hotel facilities are being developed elsewhere, such as the hotels and tourism Sector North, located on the shores of Lake Paranoá.

==Culture==

As a venue for political events, music performances and movie festivals, Brasília is a cosmopolitan city, with around 124 embassies, a wide range of restaurants and a complete infrastructure ready to host any kind of event. Not surprisingly, the city stands out as an important business/tourism destination, which is an important part of the local economy, with dozens of hotels spread around the federal capital. Traditional parties take place throughout the year.

In June, large festivals known as &quot;festas juninas&quot; are held celebrating Catholic saints such as Saint Anthony of Padua, Saint John the Baptist, and Saint Peter. On 7 September, the traditional Independence Day parade is held on the Ministries Esplanade. Throughout the year, local, national, and international events are held throughout the city. Christmas is widely celebrated, and New Year&#x27;s Eve usually hosts major events celebrated in the city.

The city also hosts a varied assortment of art works from artists like Bruno Giorgi, Alfredo Ceschiatti, Athos Bulcão, Marianne Peretti, Alfredo Volpi, Di Cavalcanti, Dyllan Taxman, Victor Brecheret and Burle Marx, whose works have been integrated into the city&#x27;s architecture, making it a unique landscape. The cuisine in the city is very diverse. Many of the best restaurants in the city can be found in the Asa Sul district.

The city is the birthplace of Brazilian rock and place of origin of bands like: Legião Urbana, Capital Inicial, Aborto Elétrico, Plebe Rude and Raimundos. Brasília has the Rock Basement Festival which brings new bands to the national scene. The festival is held in the parking of the Brasília National Stadium Mané Garrincha.
Since 1965, the annual Brasília Festival of Brazilian Cinema is one of the most traditional cinema festivals in Brazil, being compared only to the Brazilian Cinema Festival of Gramado, in Rio Grande do Sul. The difference between both is that the festival in Brasília still preserves the tradition to only submit and reward Brazilian movies.

The International Dance Seminar in Brasília has brought top-notch dance to the Federal Capital since 1991. International teachers, shows with choreographers and guest groups and scholarships abroad are some of the hallmarks of the event. The Seminar is the central axis of the DANCE BRAZIL program and is promoted by the DF State Department of Culture in partnership with the Cultural Association Claudio Santoro. 

Brasília has also been the focus of modern-day literature. Published in 2008, &quot;The World In Grey: Dom Bosco&#x27;s Prophecy&quot;, by author Ryan J. Lucero, tells an apocalyptical story based on the famous prophecy from the late 19th century by the Italian saint Don Bosco. According to Don Bosco&#x27;s prophecy: &quot;Between parallels 15 and 20, around a lake which shall be formed; A great civilization will thrive, and that will be the Promised Land&quot;. Brasília lies between the parallels 15° S and 20° S, where an artificial lake (Paranoá Lake) was formed. Don Bosco is Brasília&#x27;s patron saint.

&quot;American Flagg!&quot;, the First Comics comic book series created by Howard Chaykin, portrays Brasília as a cosmopolitan world capital of culture and exotic romance. In the series, it is a top vacation and party destination. The 2015 Rede Globo series &quot;Felizes para Sempre?&quot; was set in Brasília.

=== Architecture and urbanism ===
At the Square of Three Powers, Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer and Brazilian structural engineer Joaquim Cardozo made buildings in the style of modern Brazilian architecture. The Congress also occupies various other surrounding buildings, some connected by tunnels.

The National Congress building is located in the middle of the Eixo Monumental, the city&#x27;s main avenue. In front lies a large lawn and reflecting pool. The building faces the Praça dos Três Poderes where the Palácio do Planalto and the Supreme Federal Court are located. The Brazilian landscape architect Roberto Burle Marx designed landmark modernist gardens for some of the principal buildings. In residential areas, buildings were built that were inspired in French modernist and bauhaus design.

Although not fully accomplished, the &quot;Brasília utopia&quot; has produced a city of relatively high quality of life, in which the citizens live in forested areas with sporting and leisure structure (the &quot;&quot;) surrounded by small commercial areas, bookstores and cafés; the city is famous for its cuisine and efficiency of transit. Even these positive features have sparked controversy, expressed in the nickname &quot;ilha da fantasia&quot; (&quot;fantasy island&quot;), indicating the sharp contrast between the city and surrounding regions, marked by poverty and disorganization in the cities of the states of Goiás and Minas Gerais, around Brasília.

Critics of Brasilia&#x27;s grand scale have characterized it as a modernist bauhaus platonic fantasy about the future:


====Notable structures====
The Cathedral of Brasília in the capital of the Federative Republic of Brazil, is an expression of the atheist architect Oscar Niemeyer and the structural engineer Joaquim Cardozo. This concrete-framed hyperboloid structure, seems with its glass roof reaching up, open, to the heavens.

The cathedral&#x27;s structure was finished on 31 May 1970, and only the diameter of the circular area were visible. Niemeyer&#x27;s and Cardozo&#x27;s project of Cathedral of Brasília is based in the hyperboloid of revolution which sections are asymmetric. The hyperboloid structure itself is a result of 16 identical assembled concrete columns. There is controversy as to what these columns, having hyperbolic section and weighing 90 t, represent, some say they are two hands moving upwards to heaven, others associate it to the chalice Jesus used in the last supper and some claim it represent his crown of thorns. The cathedral was dedicated on 31 May 1970.

At the end of the &quot;Eixo Monumental&quot; (&quot;Monumental Axis&quot;) lies the &quot;Esplanada dos Ministérios&quot; (&quot;Ministries Esplanade&quot;), an open area in downtown Brasília. The rectangular lawn is surrounded by two eight-lane avenues where many government buildings, monuments and memorials are located. On Sundays and holidays, the Eixo Monumental is closed to cars so that locals may use it as a place to walk, bike, and have picnics under the trees.

&quot;Praça dos Três Poderes&quot; (Portuguese for &quot;Square of the Three Powers&quot;) is a plaza in Brasília. The name is derived from the encounter of the three federal branches around the plaza: the Executive, represented by the Palácio do Planalto (presidential office); the Legislative, represented by the National Congress (Congresso Nacional); and the Judiciary branch, represented by the Supreme Federal Court (Supremo Tribunal Federal). It is a tourist attraction in Brasília, designed by Lúcio Costa and Oscar Niemeyer as a place where the three branches would meet harmoniously.


The Palácio da Alvorada is the official residence of the president of Brazil. The palace was designed, along with the rest of the city of Brasília, by Oscar Niemeyer and inaugurated in 1958. One of the first structures built in the republic&#x27;s new capital city, the &quot;Alvorada&quot; lies on a peninsula at the shore of Lake Paranoá.

The principles of simplicity and modernity that in the past characterized the great works of architecture motivated Niemeyer. The viewer has an impression of looking at a glass box, softly landing on the ground with the support of thin external columns. The building has an area of 7,000 m2 with three floors consisting of the basement, landing, and second floor.

The auditorium, kitchen, laundry, medical center, and administration offices are at basement level. The rooms used by the presidency for official receptions are on the landing. The second floor has four suites, two apartments, and various private rooms which make up the residential part of the palace. The building also has a library, a heated Olympic-sized swimming pool, a music room, two dining rooms and various meeting rooms. A chapel and heliport are in adjacent buildings.

The Palácio do Planalto is the official workplace of the president of Brazil. It is located at the Praça dos Três Poderes in Brasília. As the seat of government, the term &quot;Planalto&quot; is often used as a metonym for the executive branch of government. The main working office of the President of the Republic is in the Palácio do Planalto.

The President and his or her family do not live in it, rather in the official residence, the Palácio da Alvorada. Besides the President, senior advisors also have offices in the &quot;Planalto&quot;, including the Vice-President of Brazil and the Chief of Staff. The other Ministries are along the Esplanada dos Ministérios. The architect of the Palácio do Planalto was Oscar Niemeyer, creator of most of the important buildings in Brasília. The idea was to project an image of simplicity and modernity using fine lines and waves to compose the columns and exterior structures. The Palace is four stories high, and has an area of 36,000 m2. Four other adjacent buildings are also part of the complex.

== Education ==

The education factor of Brasília&#x27;s Human Development Index in 2020 reached the mark of 0.804 - a considerably high level, in line with the standards of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) - while the literacy rate of the population over the age of ten indicated by the last demographic census was 96.7%, above the national average (91%).

The city has seven international schools: the American School of Brasília, the Brasília International School, the Escola das Nações, the Swiss International School, the Lycée Français François Mitterrand, the Maple Bear Canadian School, and the British School of Brasília. Brasília has two universities, three university centers, and many private colleges.

The main tertiary educational institutions are: Universidade de Brasília – University of Brasília (UnB) (public); Universidade Católica de Brasília – Catholic University of Brasília; Centro Universitário de Brasília (UniCEUB); Centro Universitário Euroamaricano (Unieuro); ; ; and Instituto de Educação Superior de Brasília.

There is an extreme concentration of higher education institutions in the Plano Piloto. In 2006, a new campus of the University of Brasilia was set up in Planaltina. There are also UnB campuses in the administrative regions of Ceilândia and Gama. The number of libraries is not proportional to the size of the population in the central area. The main public libraries in the Federal District are located in the city center, such as the University of Brasilia Library, the House and Senate Library, the Brasilia Demonstration Library and the Leonel de Moura Brizola National Library, also known as the Brasilia National Library, which opened in 2006.

==Transportation==
The average commute time on public transit in Brasília, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 96 min. 31% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 28 min, while 61% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is , while 50% travel for over in a single direction.

===Airport===


Brasília–Presidente Juscelino Kubitschek International Airport serves the metropolitan area with major domestic and international flights. It is the third busiest Brazilian airport based on passengers and aircraft movements. Because of its strategic location it is a civil aviation hub for the rest of the country. This results in a large number of takeoffs and landings and it is not unusual for flights to be delayed in a holding pattern before landing. Following the airport&#x27;s master plan, Infraero built a second runway, which was finished in 2006. In 2007, the airport handled 11,119,872 passengers. The main building&#x27;s third floor, with 12 thousand square meters, has a panoramic deck, a food court, shops, four movie theaters with total capacity of 500 people, and space for exhibitions. Brasília Airport has 136 vendor spaces. The airport is located about from the central area of Brasília, outside the metro system. The area outside the airport&#x27;s main gate is lined with taxis as well as several bus line services that connect the airport to Brasília&#x27;s central district. The parking lot accommodates 1,200 cars.

The airport is serviced by domestic and regional airlines (TAM, GOL, Azul, WebJET, Trip and Avianca), in addition to a number of international carriers. In 2012, Brasília&#x27;s International Airport was won by the InfraAmerica consortium, formed by the Brazilian engineering company ENGEVIX and the Argentine Corporacion America holding company, with a 50% stake each. During the 25-year concession, the airport may be expanded to up to 40 million passengers a year.

In 2014 the airport received 15 new boarding bridges, totaling 28 in all. This was the main requirement made by the federal government, which transferred the operation of the terminal to the Inframerica Group after an auction. The group invested R$750 million in the project. In the same year, the number of parking spaces doubled, reaching three thousand. The airport&#x27;s entrance has a new rooftop cover and a new access road. Furthermore, a VIP room was created on Terminal 1&#x27;s third floor. The investments increased the airport&#x27;s capacity from approximately 15 million passengers per year to 21 million by 2014. Brasília Air Force Base - ALA1, one of their most important bases of the Brazilian Air Force, is located in Brasília.

===Road transport===

Like most Brazilian cities, Brasília has a good network of taxi companies. Taxis from the airport are available outside the terminal, but at times there can be quite a queue of people. Although the airport is not far from the downtown area, taxi prices do seem to be higher than in other Brazilian cities. Booking in advance can be advantageous, particularly if time is limited, and local companies should be able to assist airport transfer or transport requirements.

The Juscelino Kubitschek bridge, also known as the &#x27;President JK Bridge&#x27; or the &#x27;JK Bridge&#x27;, crosses Lake Paranoá in Brasília. It is named after Juscelino Kubitschek, former president of Brazil. It was designed by architect Alexandre Chan and structural engineer Mário Vila Verde. Chan won the Gustav Lindenthal Medal for this project at the 2003 International Bridge Conference in Pittsburgh due to &quot;...outstanding achievement demonstrating harmony with the environment, aesthetic merit and successful community participation&quot;. It consists of three tall asymmetrical steel arches that crisscross diagonally. With a length of 1,200 m (0.75 miles), it was completed in 2002 at a cost of US$56.8 million. The bridge has a pedestrian walkway and is accessible to bicyclists and skaters.

The main bus hub in Brasília is the Central Bus Station, located in the crossing of the Eixo Monumental and the Eixão, about from the Three Powers Plaza. The original plan was to have a bus station as near as possible to every corner of Brasília. Today, the bus station is the hub of urban buses only, some running within Brasília and others connecting Brasília to the satellite cities. In the original city plan, the interstate buses would also stop at the Central Station. Because of the growth of Brasília (and corresponding growth in the bus fleet), today the interstate buses leave from the older interstate station (called Rodoferroviária) located at the western end of the Eixo Monumental. The Central Bus Station also contains a main metro station. A new bus station was opened in July 2010. It is on Saída Sul (South Exit) near Parkshopping Mall with its metro station, and is also an inter-state bus station, used only to leave the Federal District.

===Metro===

There is no passenger rail service in Brasília, but the Expresso Pequi rail line is planned to link Brasília and Goiânia (see below). A 22 km light rail line is also planned, estimated to cost between 1 billion reais (US$258 million) and 1.5 billion reais with capacity to transport around 200,000 passengers per day.

The Federal District Metro is Federal District&#x27;s underground metro system. The system has 24 stations on two lines, the Orange and Green lines, along a total network of , covering some of the Federal District. Both lines begin at the Central Station and run parallel until the Águas Claras Station. The Federal District Metro is not comprehensive so buses may provide better access to the center. The metro leaves the Rodoviária (bus station) and goes south, avoiding most of the political and tourist areas. The main purpose of the metro is to serve cities, such as Samambaia, Taguatinga and Ceilândia, as well as Guará and Águas Claras. The satellite cities served are more populated in total than the Plano Piloto itself (the census of 2000 indicated that Ceilândia had 344,039 inhabitants, Taguatinga had 243,575, and the Plano Piloto had approximately 400,000 inhabitants), and most residents of the satellite cities depend on public transportation.

The Expresso Pequi high-speed railway was planned between Brasília and Goiânia, the capital of the state of Goias, but it will probably be turned into a regional service linking the capital cities and cities in between, including Anápolis and Alexânia.

==Sport==

The main stadiums are Estadio Nacional Mané Garrincha (re-inaugurated on 18 May 2013), the Serejão Stadium (home for Brasiliense) and the Bezerrão Stadium (home for Gama).

There are a couple of professional clubs playing in Brasília, like Brasiliense, Gama, Brasília FC, and Real Brasília, but none are currently in the top two levels of Brazilian football. Clubs from Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo remain the most supported throughout the city.

Brasília was one of the host cities of the 2014 FIFA World Cup and 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup. Brasília hosted the opening of the Confederations Cup and hosted 7 World Cup games. Brasília also hosted the football tournaments during the 2016 Summer Olympics held in Rio de Janeiro.

Brasília is known as a departing point for the practice of unpowered air sports, sports that may be practiced with hang gliding or paragliding wings. Practitioners of such sports reveal that, because of the city&#x27;s dry weather, the city offers strong thermal winds and great &quot;cloud-streets&quot;, which is also the name for a maneuver quite appreciated by practitioners. In 2003, Brasília hosted the 14th Hang Gliding World Championship, one of the categories of free flying. In August 2005, the city hosted the second stage of the Brazilian Hang Gliding Championship.

Brasília is the site of the Autódromo Internacional Nelson Piquet which hosted the Grande Prêmio Presidente Emílio Médici, a non-championship round of the 1974 Formula One Grand Prix season, which was won by Emerson Fittipaldi. An IndyCar race was cancelled at the last minute in 2015 due to financial concerns. The track, which has been closed since 2015, is being renovated for the end of 2023 after a deal was struck with Banco de Brasília and Terracap.

The city is also home to one of Brazil&#x27;s top basketball clubs, the three-time NBB champion Uniceub BRB. The club hosts some of its games at the 16,000 all-seat Nilson Nelson Gymnasium. Brasília attempted to host the 2000 Summer Olympics, but withdrew its application. In Tennis, Brasília is host to the Aberto da República, and formerly hosted the Aberto de Brasília.

<text>The de Havilland Propellers Blue Streak was a British Intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), and later the first stage of the Europa satellite launch vehicle. Blue Streak was cancelled without entering full production.

The project was intended to maintain an independent British nuclear deterrent, replacing the V bomber fleet which would become obsolete by 1965. The operational requirement for the missile was issued in 1955 and the design was complete by 1957. During development, it became clear that the missile system was too expensive and too vulnerable to a surprise attack. The missile project was cancelled in 1960, with US-led Skybolt the preferred replacement.

Partly to avoid political embarrassment from the cancellation, the UK government proposed that the rocket be used as the first stage of a civilian satellite launcher called Black Prince. As the cost was thought to be too great for the UK alone, international collaboration was sought. This led to the formation of the European Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO), with Blue Streak used as the first stage of a carrier rocket named Europa.

Europa was tested at Woomera Test Range, Australia and later at Kourou in French Guiana. Following launch failures, the ELDO project was cancelled in 1972 and Blue Streak with it.
==Background==
Post-war Britain&#x27;s nuclear weapons armament was initially based on free-fall bombs delivered by the V bomber force. It soon became clear that if Britain wanted to have a credible nuclear deterrent threat, a ballistic missile was essential. There was a political need for an independent deterrent, so that Britain could remain a major world power. Britain was unable to purchase American weapons wholesale due to the restrictions of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946.

In April 1954 the Americans proposed a joint development programme for ballistic missiles. The United States would develop an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) of range (SM-65 Atlas), while the United Kingdom with United States support would develop an Intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) of range. The proposal was accepted as part of the Wilson-Sandys Agreement of August 1954, which provided for collaboration, exchange of information, and mutual planning of development programmes. The decision to develop was influenced by what could be learnt about missile design and development in the US. Initial requirements for the booster were made by the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough with input on the rocket engine design from the Rocket Propulsion Establishment at Westcott. Operational Requirement 1139 demanded a rocket of at least range and the initially proposed rocket would have just reached that threshold.

The de Havilland Propellers company won the contract to build the missile, which was to be powered by an uprated liquid-fuelled Rocketdyne S-3D engine, developed by Rolls-Royce, called RZ.2. Two variants of this engine were developed: the first provided a static thrust of and the second (intended for the three-stage satellite launch vehicle) . The engines could be vectored by seven degrees in flight and were used to guide the missile. This configuration, however, put considerable pressure on the autopilot which had to cope with the problem of a vehicle whose weight was diminishing rapidly and that was steered by large engines whose thrust remained more or less constant. Vibration was also a problem, particularly at engine cut-off, and the later development of the autopilot for the satellite launcher was, in itself, a considerable achievement.

Subcontractors included the Sperry Gyroscope Company who produced the missile guidance system whilst the nuclear warhead was designed by the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment at Aldermaston.

The missiles used liquid oxygen and kerosene propellants. Whilst the vehicle could be left fully laden with over 20 tonnes of kerosene, the 60 tonnes of liquid oxygen had to be loaded immediately before launch or icing became a problem. Due to this, fuelling the rocket took 4.5 minutes, which would have made it useless as a rapid response to an attack. The missile was vulnerable to a pre-emptive nuclear strike, launched without warning or in the absence of any heightening of tension sufficient to warrant readying the missile. To negate this problem de Havilland created a stand-by feature. A missile could be held at 30 seconds&#x27; notice to launch for ten hours. As the missiles were to be deployed in pairs and it took ten hours for one missile to be prepared for stand-by, one of the two missiles could always be ready for rapid launch.

To protect the missiles against a pre-emptive strike while being fuelled, the idea of sitting the missiles in underground launchers was developed. These would have been designed to withstand a one megaton blast at a distance of and were a British innovation, subsequently exported to the United States. Finding sites for these silos proved extremely difficult. RAF Spadeadam in Cumberland (now Cumbria) was the only site where construction was started on a full scale underground launcher, although test borings were undertaken at a number of other locations. The remains of this test silo, known as U1, were rediscovered by tree felling at Spadeadam. This was also the site where the RZ.2 rocket engines and also the complete Blue Streak missile were tested. The best sites for silo construction were the more stable rock strata in parts of southern and north-east England and eastern Scotland, but the construction of many underground silos in the countryside carried enormous economic, social, and political costs. Development of the underground launchers presented a major technical challenge. 1/60- and 1/6-scale models based on a U-shaped design were constructed and tested at RPE Westcott. Three alternative designs were drawn up with one chosen as the prototype, designated K11. RAF Upavon would appear to have been the preferred location for the prototype operational launcher with the former RNAS at Crail as the likely first operational site.

In 1955–1956, the rocket motors were test-fired at High Down Rocket Test Site on the Isle of Wight. As no site in Britain provided enough space for test flights, a test site was established at Woomera, South Australia.
==Cancellation as a military project==
Doubts arose as the cost escalated from the first tentative figure of £50 million submitted to the Treasury in early 1955, to £300 million in late 1959. Its detractors in the civil service claimed that the programme was crawling along when compared with the speed of development in the US and the Soviet Union. 

Estimates within the Civil Service for completion of the project ranged from a total spend of £550 million to £1.3 billion, as different ministers were set on either abandoning or continuing the project.

The project was unexpectedly cancelled in April 1960. Whitehall opposition grew, and it was cancelled on the ostensible grounds that it would be too vulnerable to a first-strike attack. Admiral of the Fleet Lord Mountbatten had spent considerable effort arguing that the project should be cancelled at once in favour of the Navy being armed with nuclear weapons, capable of pre-emptive strike.

Some considered the cancellation of Blue Streak to be not only a blow to British military-industrial efforts, but also to Commonwealth ally Australia, which had its own vested interest in the project.

The British military transferred its hopes for a strategic nuclear delivery system to the Anglo-American Skybolt missile, before the project&#x27;s cancellation by the United States as its ICBM programme reached maturity. The British instead purchased the Polaris system from the Americans, carried in British-built submarines.

==Civilian programmes - Black Prince and ELDO==
After the cancellation as a military project, there was reluctance to cancel the project because of the huge cost incurred. Blue Streak would have become the first stage of a projected all British satellite launcher known as &quot;Black Prince&quot;: the second stage was derived from the &quot;Black Knight&quot; test vehicle, and the orbital injection stage was a small hydrogen peroxide/kerosene motor.

Black Prince proved too expensive for the UK, and the European Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO) was set up. This used Blue Streak as the first stage, with French and German second and third stages. The Blue Streak first stage was successfully tested three times at the Woomera test range in Australia as part of the ELDO programme.

=== Black Prince ===

In 1959, a year before the cancellation of the Blue Streak as a missile, the government requested that the RAE and Saunders-Roe design a carrier rocket based on Blue Streak and Black Knight. This design used Blue Streak as a first stage and a second stage based on the Black Knight. Several different third stages would be available, depending on the required payload and orbit.

The cost of developing Black Prince was estimated to be £35 million.

It was planned that Black Prince would be a Commonwealth project. As the government of John Diefenbaker in Canada was already spending more money than publicly acknowledged on Alouette and Australia was not interested in the project, these two countries were unwilling to contribute. South Africa was no longer a member of the Commonwealth. New Zealand was only likely to make &quot;modest&quot; contributions.

===European Launcher Development Organisation===
The UK instead proposed a collaboration with other European countries to build a three-stage launcher capable of placing a one-ton payload into low Earth orbit. 
The European Launcher Development Organisation consisted of Belgium, Britain, France, West Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, with Australia as an associate member.

Preliminary work began in 1962 and ELDO was formally signed into existence in 1964.

With Blue Streak, the UK became the first stage of the European launch vehicle with France providing the Coralie second stage and Germany the third. Italy worked on the satellite project, the Netherlands and Belgium concentrated on tracking and telemetry systems and Australia supplied the launch site.

The combined launcher was named Europa.

After ten test launches, the Woomera launch site was not suitable for putting satellites into geosynchronous orbit, and in 1966 it was decided to move to the French site of Kourou in South America. F11 was fired from here in November 1971, but the failure of the autopilot caused the vehicle to break up. The launch of F12 was postponed whilst a project review was carried out, which led to the decision to abandon the Europa design.

ELDO was merged with the European Space Research Organisation to form the European Space Agency.
==Related projects==
Aside from Black Prince, a range of other proposals was made between 1959 and 1972 for a carrier rocket based on Blue Streak, but none of these were ever built in full and today only exist in design.

===De Havilland/British Interplanetary Society proposal===
In 1959 de Havilland suggested solving the problem of the Blue Streak/Black Knight geometry by compressing the 10 by 1 metre (30 by 3-foot) Black Knight into a sphere. Although this seemed logical, the development costs proved to be too high for the limited budget of the programme.

===Westland Helicopters Black Arrow===
Following its merger with Saunders Roe, Westland Helicopters developed the three-stage Black Arrow satellite carrier rocket, derived from the Black Knight test vehicle. The first stage of Black Arrow was given the same diameter as the French Coralie (the second stage of Europa) to make it compatible with Blue Streak. Using Blue Streak as an additional stage would have increased Black Arrow&#x27;s payload capacity. To maintain this compatibility, the first stage diameter was given in metres, although the rest of the rocket was defined in imperial units.

Black Arrow carried out four test launches (without an additional Blue Streak stage) from Woomera between 1969 and 1971, with the final launch carrying the satellite Prospero X-3 into orbit. The United Kingdom remains the only country to have developed and then abandoned a satellite launch capability.

===Hawker Siddeley Dynamics proposal===
In 1972, Hawker Siddeley Dynamics ltd produced a brochure for a design using Blue Streak as the first stage of a two-stage to orbit rocket, with an American Centaur upper stage. The Centaur second stage would have either been built in the UK under licence or imported directly from the USA. Both the Centaur and Blue Streak had proved to be very reliable up to this point, and since they were both already designed development costs would have been low. Furthermore, it had a payload of 870–920 kg to a geosynchronous orbit with, and 650–700 kg without the use of additional booster rockets.

==Blue Streak today==
Following the cancellation of the Blue Streak project some of the remaining rockets were preserved at:

* Europa F13, at the National Museum of Flight in East Fortune, Scotland.
* Europa F14, at the Deutsches Museum, Munich.
* Europa F15, at the Euro Space Center in Redu, Belgium.
* Europa F16, at the National Space Centre in Leicester, England.
* Mid-section outer shell and launch sites, at the RAF Spadeadam near Brampton, England.

A section of the propulsion bay, engines and equipment can be found at the Solway Aviation Museum, Carlisle Lake District Airport. Only a few miles from the Spadeadam testing site, the museum carries many exhibits, photographs and models of the Blue Streak programme, having inherited the original Spadeadam collection that used to be displayed on site.

RZ.2 engines are on display at National Space Centre – a pair on cradles alongside the Blue Streak rocket – and at the Armagh Planetarium in Northern Ireland and The Euro Space Center in Redu, Belgium.

Blue Streak enthusiast Robin Joseph from the United Kingdom has a collection of parts including start systems and combustion chambers amongst other things. He can often be seen displaying his collection at space days in the West Midlands.

A part of the Blue Streak F1 rocket launched on 5 June 1964 from Woomera, Australia, found 50 km SE of Giles in 1980 (c.1000 km) is on display at Giles Weather Station. The titanium structure of a German third stage was, for some time, sited on the edge of a gravel pit in Gloucestershire.

Remains of Blue Streak F4, launched on 24 May 1965, are on display at Woomera.

Footage from the Blue Streak launch was briefly incorporated into &quot;The Prisoner&quot;″s final episode, &quot;Fall Out&quot;. It was also used in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Tenth Planet&quot;, treated within the story as the launch of the &quot;Zeus IV&quot; spacecraft. Images of the Blue Streak 1 are incorporated in the 1997 film &quot;Contact&quot;.

<text>Bakassi is a peninsula on the Gulf of Guinea. It lies between the Cross River estuary, near the city of Calabar and the Rio del Ray estuary on the east. It is governed by Cameroon, following the transfer of sovereignty from neighbouring Nigeria as a result of a judgment by the International Court of Justice. On 22 November 2007, the Nigerian Senate rejected the transfer, since the Greentree Agreement ceding the area to Cameroon was contrary to Section 12(1) of the 1999 Constitution. Regardless, the territory was completely ceded to Cameroon on 14 August 2008, exactly two years after the first part of it was transferred.

==Geography and economy==
The peninsula lies between latitudes 4°25′ and 5°10′N and longitudes 8°20′ and 9°08′E . It consists of a number of low-lying, largely mangrove covered islands covering an area of around . The population of Bakassi is the subject of some dispute, but is generally put at between 150,000 and 300,000 people.

Bakassi is situated at the extreme eastern end of the Gulf of Guinea, where the warm east-flowing Guinea Current (called Aya Efiat in Efik) meets the cold north-flowing Benguela Current (called Aya Ubenekang in Efik). These two ocean currents interact, creating huge foamy breakers which constantly advance towards the shore. This builds up shoals rich in fish, shrimps, and a wide variety of other marine life forms, thus making the area a very fertile fishing ground, from which most of the population make their living.

The peninsula is commonly described as &quot;oil-rich&quot;, though in fact no commercially viable deposits of oil have been discovered. However, the area has aroused considerable interest from oil companies in the light of the discovery of rich reserves of high grade crude oil in Nigeria. At least eight multinational oil companies have participated in the exploration of the peninsula and its offshore waters. In October 2012, China Petroleum &amp; Chemical Corporation announced it had discovered new oil and gas resources in the Bakassi region.

==History==
During the Scramble for Africa, Queen Victoria signed a Treaty of Protection with the King and Chiefs of Akwa Akpa, known to Europeans as Old Calabar, on 10 September 1884. This enabled the British Empire to exercise control over the entire territory around Calabar, including Bakassi. The territory subsequently became &quot;de facto&quot; part of Nigeria, although the border was never permanently delineated. However, documents released by the Cameroonians, in parity with that of the British and Germans, clearly places Bakassi under Cameroonian Territory as a consequence of colonial era Anglo-German agreements. After Southern Cameroons voted in 1961 to leave Nigeria and became a part of Cameroon, Bakassi remained under Calabar administration in Nigeria until ICJ judgement of 2002.

==Population==
Bakassi inhabitants are mainly the Oron people, the people of Cross River State and Akwa Ibom State of Nigeria.

==Territorial dispute==
Nigeria and Cameroon have disputed the possession of Bakassi for some years, leading to considerable tension between the two countries. In 1981 the two countries went to the brink of war over Bakassi and another area around Lake Chad, at the other end of the two countries&#x27; common border. More armed clashes broke out in the early 1990s. In response, Cameroon took the matter to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on 29 March 1994.

The case was extremely complex, requiring the court to review diplomatic exchanges dating back over 100 years. Nigeria relied largely on Anglo-German correspondence dating from 1885 as well as treaties between the colonial powers and the indigenous rulers in the area, particularly the 1884 Treaty of Protection. Cameroon pointed to the Anglo-German treaty of 1913, which defined sphere of control in the region, as well as two agreements signed in the 1970s between Cameroon and Nigeria. These were the Yaoundé II Declaration of 4 April 1971 and the Maroua Declaration of 1 June 1975, which were devised to outline maritime boundaries between the two countries following their independence. The line was drawn through the Cross River estuary to the west of the peninsula, thereby implying Cameroonian ownership over Bakassi. However, Nigeria never ratified the agreement, while Cameroon regarded it as being in force.

===ICJ verdict===
The ICJ delivered its judgment on 10 October 2002, finding (based principally on the Anglo-German agreements) that sovereignty over Bakassi did indeed rest with Cameroon. It instructed Nigeria to transfer possession of the peninsula, but did not require the inhabitants to move or to change their nationality. Cameroon was thus given a substantial Nigerian population and was required to protect their rights, infrastructure and welfare.

The verdict caused consternation in Nigeria. It aroused vitriolic comments from Nigerian officials and the Nigerian media alike. Chief Richard Akinjide, a former Nigerian Attorney-General and Minister of Justice who had been a leading member of Nigeria&#x27;s legal team, described the decision as &quot;50% international law and 50% international politics&quot;, &quot;blatantly biased and unfair&quot;, &quot;a total disaster&quot;, and a &quot;complete fraud&quot;. The Nigerian newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; went further, declaring that the judgment was &quot;a rape and unforeseen potential international conspiracy against Nigerian territorial integrity and sovereignty&quot; and &quot;part of a Western ploy to foment and perpetuate trouble in Africa&quot;. The outcome of the controversy was a &quot;de facto&quot; Nigerian refusal to withdraw its troops from Bakassi and transfer sovereignty. The Nigerian government did not, however, openly reject the judgment but instead called for an agreement that would provide &quot;peace with honour, with the interest and welfare of our people&quot;.

The ICJ judgement was backed up by the United Nations, whose charter potentially allowed sanctions or even the use of force to enforce the court&#x27;s ruling. Secretary-General Kofi Annan stepped in as a mediator and chaired a tripartite summit with the two countries&#x27; presidents on 15 November 2002, which established a commission to facilitate the peaceful implementation of the ICJ&#x27;s judgement. A further summit was held on 31 January 2004. This made significant progress, but the process was complicated by the opposition of Bakassi&#x27;s inhabitants to being transferred to Cameroon.
Bakassian leaders threatened to seek independence if Nigeria renounced sovereignty. This secession was announced on 9 July 2006, as the &quot;Democratic Republic of Bakassi&quot;. The decision was reportedly made at a meeting on 2 July 2006 and &quot;The Vanguard&quot; newspaper of Nigeria reported the decision to secede. The decision was reportedly made by groups of militants including Southern Cameroons under the aegis of Southern Cameroons Peoples Organisation (SCAPO), Bakassi Movement for Self-Determination (BAMOSD), and the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND).
 The Biafra separatist group, Biafra Nations League (BNL), initially known as Biafra Nations Youth League, led by Princewill Chimezie Richard (known as Prince Obuka) and Ebuta Akor Takon (not the former Deputy, Ebuta Ogar Takon) moved their operational base to the peninsula, after series of warnings to the Nigeria government over the plight of the internally displaced natives and the reported killing of remnants in the peninsula by Cameroon forces. This came amid clashes between Nigerian troops and the Bakassi Strike Force, a militant group that focused on attacking Nigerian and Cameroon forces. BNL Leaders were later apprehended in the Ikang-Cameroon border area on 9 November 2016 by Nigerian troops according to the &quot;Nigeria nation&quot; newspaper; reports linked the Biafra group to the militant groups.
BNL demanded that oil companies authorized to drill for oil by Nigeria and Cameroon leave the maritime boundary area of Bakassi Peninsula. The group also threatened to attack Cameroon Forces.

===Resolution===
On 13 June 2006, President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria and President Paul Biya of Cameroon resolved the dispute in talks led by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan in New York City. Obasanjo agreed to withdraw Nigerian troops within 60 days and to leave the territory completely in Cameroonian control within the next two years. Annan said, &quot;With today&#x27;s agreement on the Bakassi peninsula, a comprehensive resolution of the dispute is within our grasp. The momentum achieved must be sustained.&quot;

===Nigerian withdrawal and low-level insurgency===
Nigeria began to withdraw its forces, comprising some 3,000 troops, beginning 1 August 2006, and a ceremony on 14 August marked the formal handover of the northern part of the peninsula. The remainder stayed under Nigerian civil authority for two more years.

On 22 November 2007, the Nigerian Senate passed a resolution declaring that the withdrawal from the Bakassi Peninsula was illegal. The government took no action, and handed the final parts of Bakassi over to Cameroon on 14 August 2008 as planned, but a Federal High Court had stated this should be delayed until all accommodations for resettled Bakassians had been settled; the government did not seem to plan to heed this court order, and set the necessary mechanisms into motion to override it. Fishermen displaced from Bakassi were first settled in a landlocked area called New Bakassi, which they claimed was already inhabited and not suitable for fishermen like them but only for farmers. The displaced people were then moved to Akpabuyo, and eventually established a new community of Dayspring.

Despite the formal handover of Bakassi by Nigeria to Cameroon in 2006, the territory of Bakassi is still mentioned as part of the 774 local governments in Nigeria as embodied in the First Schedule, Part I of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999. After the Nigerian 2015 general elections, Nigeria&#x27;s 8th National Assembly still accommodates the Calabar-South/Akpabuyo/Bakassi Federal Constituency represented by Hon. Essien Ekpeyong Ayi of the People&#x27;s Democratic Party.

In the 2010s and 2020s, Biafran separatists, most importantly Biafra Nations League, still continue a low-level militant resistance against Cameroon in regards to Bakassi.

<doc id="4757" wikidata="Q830560" url="?curid=4757" title="Bestiary">
<text>A bestiary () is a compendium of beasts. Originating in the ancient world, bestiaries were made popular in the Middle Ages in illustrated volumes that described various animals and even rocks. The natural history and illustration of each beast was usually accompanied by a moral lesson. This reflected the belief that the world itself was the Word of God and that every living thing had its own special meaning. For example, the pelican, which was believed to tear open its breast to bring its young to life with its own blood, was a living representation of Jesus. Thus the bestiary is also a reference to the symbolic language of animals in Western Christian art and literature.

==History==
The bestiary — the medieval book of beasts — was among the most popular illuminated texts in northern Europe during the Middle Ages (about 500–1500). Medieval Christians understood every element of the world as a manifestation of God, and bestiaries largely focused on each animal&#x27;s religious meaning. Much of what is in the bestiary came from the ancient Greeks and their philosophers. The earliest bestiary in the form in which it was later popularized was an anonymous 2nd-century Greek volume called the &quot;Physiologus&quot;, which itself summarized ancient knowledge and wisdom about animals in the writings of classical authors such as Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Historia Animalium&quot; and various works by Herodotus, Pliny the Elder, Solinus, Aelian and other naturalists.

Following the &quot;Physiologus&quot;, Saint Isidore of Seville (Book XII of the &quot;Etymologiae&quot;) and Saint Ambrose expanded the religious message with reference to passages from the Bible and the Septuagint. They and other authors freely expanded or modified pre-existing models, constantly refining the moral content without interest in or access to much more detail regarding the factual content. Nevertheless, the often fanciful accounts of these beasts were widely read and generally believed to be true. A few observations found in bestiaries, such as the migration of birds, were discounted by the natural philosophers of later centuries, only to be rediscovered in the modern scientific era.

Medieval bestiaries are remarkably similar in sequence of the animals of which they treat. Bestiaries were particularly popular in England and France around the 12th century and were mainly compilations of earlier texts. The Aberdeen Bestiary is one of the best known of over 50 manuscript bestiaries surviving today.

Much influence comes from the Renaissance era and the general Middle Ages, as well as modern times. The Renaissance has been said to have started around the 14th century in Italy. Bestiaries influenced early heraldry in the Middle Ages, giving ideas for charges and also for the artistic form. Bestiaries continue to give inspiration to coats of arms created in our time.

Two illuminated Psalters, the Queen Mary Psalter (British Library Ms. Royal 2B, vii) and the Isabella Psalter (State Library, Munich), contain full Bestiary cycles. The bestiary in the Queen Mary Psalter is found in the &quot;marginal&quot; decorations that occupy about the bottom quarter of the page, and are unusually extensive and coherent in this work. In fact the bestiary has been expanded beyond the source in the Norman bestiary of Guillaume le Clerc to ninety animals. Some are placed in the text to make correspondences with the psalm they are illustrating.

Many decide to make their own bestiary with their own observations including knowledge from previous ones. These observations can be made in text form, as well as illustrated out. The Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci also made his own bestiary.

A &quot;volucrary&quot; is a similar collection of the symbols of birds that is sometimes found in conjunction with bestiaries. The most widely known volucrary in the Renaissance was Johannes de Cuba&#x27;s &quot;Gart der Gesundheit&quot; which describes 122 birds and which was printed in 1485.

==Bestiary content==
The contents of medieval bestiaries were often obtained and created from combining older textual sources and accounts of animals, such as the &quot;Physiologus&quot;.

Medieval bestiaries contained detailed descriptions and illustrations of species native to Western Europe, exotic animals and what in modern times are considered to be imaginary animals. Descriptions of the animals included the physical characteristics associated with the creature, although these were often physiologically incorrect, along with the Christian morals that the animal represented. The description was then often accompanied by an artistic illustration of the animal as described in the bestiary. For example, in one bestiary the eagle is depicted in an illustration and is said to be the “king of birds.”

Bestiaries were organized in different ways based upon the sources they drew upon. The descriptions could be organized by animal groupings, such as terrestrial and marine creatures, or presented in an alphabetical manner. However, the texts gave no distinction between existing and imaginary animals. Descriptions of creatures such as dragons, unicorns, basilisk, griffin and caladrius were common in such works and found intermingled amongst accounts of bears, boars, deer, lions, and elephants. In one source, the author explains how fables and bestiaries are closely linked to one another as “each chapter of a bestiary, each fable in a collection, has a text and has a meaning.

This lack of separation has often been associated with the assumption that people during this time believed in what the modern period classifies as nonexistent or &quot;imaginary creatures&quot;. However, this assumption is currently under debate, with various explanations being offered. Some scholars, such as Pamela Gravestock, have written on the theory that medieval people did not actually think such creatures existed but instead focused on the belief in the importance of the Christian morals these creatures represented, and that the importance of the moral did not change regardless if the animal existed or not. The historian of science David C. Lindberg pointed out that medieval bestiaries were rich in symbolism and allegory, so as to teach moral lessons and entertain, rather than to convey knowledge of the natural world.

== Religious significance ==
The significance shown between animals and religion started much before bestiaries came into play.  In many ancient civilizations there are references to animals and their meaning within that specific religion or mythology that we know of today. These civilizations included Egypt and their gods with the faces of animals or Greece which had symbolic animals for their godly beings, an example being Zeus and the eagle. With animals being a part of religion before bestiaries and their lessons came out, they were influenced by past observations of meaning as well as older civilizations and their interpretations.

As most of the students who read these bestiaries were monks and clerics, it is not impossible to say that there is a major religious significance within them. The bestiary was used to educate young men on the correct morals they should display. All of the animals presented in the bestiaries show some sort of lesson or meaning when presented. Much of the symbolism shown of animals. Much of what is proposed by the bestiaries mentions much of paganism because of the religious significance and time period of the medieval ages.

One of the main &#x27;animals&#x27; mentioned in some of the bestiaries is dragons, which hold much significance in terms of religion and meaning. The unnatural part of dragon&#x27;s history shows how important the church can be during this time. Much of what is covered in the article talks about how the dragon that is mentioned in some of the bestiaries shows a glimpse of the religious significance in many of these tales.

These bestiaries held much content in terms of religious significance. In almost every animal there is some way to connect it to a lesson from the church or a familiar religious story. With animals holding significance since ancient times, it is fair to say that bestiaries and their contents gave fuel to the context behind the animals, whether real or myth, and their meanings.

==Modern bestiaries==
In modern times, artists such as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and Saul Steinberg have produced their own bestiaries. Jorge Luis Borges wrote a contemporary bestiary of sorts, the &quot;Book of Imaginary Beings&quot;, which collects imaginary beasts from bestiaries and fiction. Nicholas Christopher wrote a literary novel called &quot;The Bestiary&quot; (Dial, 2007) that describes a lonely young man&#x27;s efforts to track down the world&#x27;s most complete bestiary. John Henry Fleming&#x27;s &quot;Fearsome Creatures of Florida&quot; (Pocol Press, 2009) borrows from the medieval bestiary tradition to impart moral lessons about the environment. Caspar Henderson&#x27;s &quot;The Book of Barely Imagined Beings&quot; (Granta 2012, University of Chicago Press 2013), subtitled &quot;A 21st Century Bestiary&quot;, explores how humans imagine animals in a time of rapid environmental change. In July 2014, Jonathan Scott wrote &quot;The Blessed Book of Beasts&quot;, Eastern Christian Publications, featuring 101 animals from the various translations of the Bible, in keeping with the tradition of the bestiary found in the writings of the Saints, including Saint John Chrysostom. In today&#x27;s world there is a discipline called cryptozoology which is the study of unknown species. This discipline can be linked to medieval bestiaries because in many cases the unknown animals can be the same, as well as having meaning or significance behind them.

The lists of monsters to be found in video games (such as &quot;NetHack&quot;, &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;, and &quot;Monster Hunter&quot;), as well as some tabletop role-playing games such as Pathfinder, are often termed bestiaries.

<doc id="4760" wikidata="Q2636072" url="?curid=4760" title="The Ballad of the Green Berets">
<text>&quot;The Ballad of the Green Berets&quot; is a 1966 patriotic song in the ballad style about the United States Army Special Forces. Written and performed by Staff Sergeant Barry Sadler, it was one of the few popular songs of the Vietnam War years to cast the military in a positive light. Sadler&#x27;s version became a major hit in January 1966, reaching No. 1 for five weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and four weeks on Cashbox. It was also a crossover hit, reaching No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Easy Listening chart and No. 2 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Country survey.

Sadler began writing the song when he was training to be a Special Forces medic. The author Robin Moore, who wrote the book &quot;The Green Berets&quot;, helped him write the lyrics and later sign a recording contract with RCA Records. The demo of the song was produced in a rudimentary recording studio at Fort Bragg, North Carolina with the help of Gerry Gitell and LTG William P. Yarborough.

The lyrics were written, in part, in honor of U.S. Army Specialist 5 James Gabriel Jr., a Special Forces operator and the first native Hawaiian to die in Vietnam. Gabriel was killed by Viet Cong gunfire while on a training mission with the South Vietnamese Army on April 8, 1962. One verse mentioned Gabriel by name, but it was not used in the recorded version.

Sadler recorded the song and eleven other tunes with Sid Bass at RCA&#x27;s 24th Street Studios in New York City on December 18, 1965. The song and album, &quot;Ballads of the Green Berets&quot;, were released in January 1966. He performed the song on television on January 30, 1966, on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, and on other TV shows including &quot;The Hollywood Palace&quot; and &quot;The Jimmy Dean Show&quot;.

== Popularity ==
In the United States, &quot;The Ballad of the Green Berets&quot; topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in March 1966, staying at No. 1 for five weeks. It placed tenth on the year-end Hot 100 chart published by &quot;Billboard&quot; in December 1966. When &quot;Billboard&quot; later revised its year-end rankings for 1966, the song was re-ranked at No. 1; since then, &quot;Billboard&quot; has recognized &quot;The Ballad of the Green Berets&quot; as the top Hot 100 song of that year. On &quot;Cash Box&quot; 1966 year-end chart, &quot;The Ballad of the Green Berets&quot; tied for first with &quot;California Dreamin&#x27;&quot; by the Mamas and the Papas. It was also the No. 21 song of the 1960s as ranked by Joel Whitburn. The single sold more than nine million copies; the album, more than two million.

&quot;The Ballad of the Green Berets&quot; has been one of the four primary marching tunes of the Fightin&#x27; Texas Aggie Band since at least the 1980s.

== In film ==
The song is heard in a choral rendition by Ken Darby in the 1968 John Wayne film &quot;The Green Berets&quot;, based on Robin Moore&#x27;s book. The film&#x27;s score was not released as an album until &quot;Film Score Monthly&quot; released it in 2005. A movie tie-in featuring artwork from the film and a cover version by Ennio Morricone was released in Europe, though the album&#x27;s other tracks were from &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; and &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot;. In &quot;The Many Saints of Newark&quot;, while Dickie Moltisanti is driving over in his car to meet Harold McBrayer for the first time, &quot;The Ballad of the Green Berets&quot; is playing on the radio.

The cast of the 2018 movie &quot;12 Strong&quot; sing the tune as their Chinook helicopter takes off.

This song is featured in the 1979 film &quot;More American Graffiti&quot;, during the first sequence of Terry the Toad&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Eve in 1965 Vietnam.

The song is featured prominently as a prop (with French lyrics unrelated to the American lyrics), in the opening scene of the French-produced Netflix biopic miniseries about Bernard Tapie eponymously titled &quot;Tapie&quot;.

== Other versions derivatives ==
Many other American recording artists did their own versions of the song ranging from Kate Smith and Duane Eddy to unknown artists singing on various drugstore records.

Many versions in other languages are rewritten to reference local units; these include:

* A German version (&quot;Hundert Mann und ein Befehl&quot;), sung by Freddy Quinn and later again by Heidi Brühl had considerable success in Germany. The German version is a song &quot;against&quot; the war. Freddy Quinn sings the song from the point of view of a reluctant but forced soldier, Heidi Brühl from the point of view of the crying girlfriend of the soldier. Freddy Quinn&#x27;s version was later recorded by and also by Cryptic Wintermoon.
* The Royal Netherlands Army&#x27;s Korps Commandotroepen (KCT) use the original lyrics with a couple changes referencing the Netherlands. This version is sung to recruits who have successfully completed the harsh Basic Commando Training (ECO), and who receive their Green Beret.
* The Residents recorded a cover of the song for the album &quot;The Third Reich &#x27;n Roll&quot; as a part of &quot;Hitler was a Vegetarian&quot;
* Rhodesian singer-songwriter John Edmond recorded the &quot;Ballad of the Green Berets&quot; with reference to the soldiers of the Rhodesian Light Infantry (RLI), commando-style fireforce units of Rhodesian Security Forces who wore berets of green color, with a slight difference in the chorus, saying &quot;&quot;These are men, of The Fatherland’s Best.&quot; &amp; &quot;Make him one of The Fatherlands best&quot;&quot; A &quot;Ballad of the Red Beret&quot; was sung by the Rhodesian Ministry of Internal Affairs at their battlecamp in Chikurubi. In South Africa, the &quot;Ballad of the Green Berets&quot; was recorded as the &quot;Ballad of the Maroon Berets&quot;. The Maroon beret is a symbol of the South African Special Forces Brigade and the South African 44 Parachute Regiment. Also this song was re-recorded by South African opera singer Leonore Veenemans as &quot;My Land Suid-Afrika&quot;.
* The Swedish version &quot;Balladen om den blå baskern&quot; is a salute to the Swedish soldiers serving in the United Nations&#x27; peace-keeping forces (the Blue Berets). It was sung by Anita Lindblom.
* The Italian version is called &quot;La Ballata del Soldato&quot;, sung by Quartetto Cetra.
* Since 2004, the Infantry Officer&#x27;s School of the Swiss Armed Forces uses a quadrlingual (German, French, Italian and Rumansch) version of the song, &quot;Die Infanterieballade&quot; (The Infantry Ballad), as their anthem. The lyrics were written by cadets from all linguistical regions of Switzerland. It is sung everyday onwards to the morning , before the National Anthem.
* In 1966, Bernard Tapy (real name Bernard Tapie, businessman and politician), recorded an adaptation in French as &quot;Passeport pour le soleil&quot;
* The official song of the Portuguese Paratroopers a.k.a. &quot;Boinas Verdes&quot; (&quot;Green Berets&quot;) uses the melody with Português-language lyrics
* The Ukrainian version 2015 &quot;100 Soldiers&quot;. Lyrics by Oleksa Nehrebets&#x27;kyi.
* The Finnish version titled &quot;Balladi punaisista bareteista&quot; was released in 1966 by Kivikasvot.
* The Norwegian version &quot;Balladen om den grønne beret&quot; (both Norwegian and English lyrics) is about the Garrison of Sør-Varanger (GSV). They monitor the border between Norway and Russia 24/7. Their motto is &quot;VOGT OG VERN&quot; (GUARD AND PROTECT).

== Parodies or humorous use ==
* The melody and rhyme pattern were adapted by Filipino musician Eddie Tallada recording the &quot;Ballad of Subic Bay&quot; describing Vietnam war sailors&#x27; liberty in the town of Olongapo adjacent to the Subic Bay Naval Base.
* In 1968, The Beach Bums, an ad hoc group featuring a young Bob Seger, recorded &quot;The Ballad of the Yellow Beret&quot;, chronicling the adventures of a draft dodger. The record was withdrawn after a cease and desist letter from Sadler.
* The Residents parodied the song on their &quot;Third Reich &amp; Roll&quot; album.
* Another parody was used on an episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; that William Shatner hosted in 1986, called &quot;Ollie North, The Mute Marine&quot;. Shatner participated in the sketch, outfitted in a USMC Class A uniform, alluding to Oliver North&#x27;s refusal to speak about his participation in the Iran-Contra Affair; Shatner spoke no words.
* The song is used to humorous effect in Michael Moore&#x27;s film &quot;Canadian Bacon&quot; as ill-informed Americans prepare for an invasion by Canada.
* In the film &quot;Caddyshack&quot;, Bill Murray mumbles the song under his breath while he is connecting the wires to the plunger as he prepares for his final battle with his gopher nemesis.
* In an episode of &quot;Cheers&quot;, Cliff Clavin aborts his plans to emigrate to Canada with his love interest when Sam, Woody, and Frasier appeal to his patriotic side by singing the song.

<doc id="4763" wikidata="Q3015601" url="?curid=4763" title="Baroque dance">
<text>Baroque dance is dance of the Baroque era (roughly 1600–1750), closely linked with Baroque music, theatre, and opera.

== English country dance ==

The majority of surviving choreographies from the period are English country dances, such as those in the many editions of Playford&#x27;s &quot;The Dancing Master&quot;. Playford only gives the floor patterns of the dances, with no indication of the steps. However, other sources of the period, such as the writings of the French dancing-masters Feuillet and Lorin, indicate that steps more complicated than simple walking were used at least some of the time.

English country dance survived well beyond the Baroque era and eventually spread in various forms across Europe and its colonies, and to all levels of society.

== The French Noble style ==
The great innovations in dance in the 17th century originated at the French court under Louis XIV, and it is here that we see the first clear stylistic ancestor of classical ballet. The same basic technique was used both at social events, and as theatrical dance in court ballets and at public theaters. The style of dance is commonly known to modern scholars as the &quot;French noble style&quot; or &quot;belle danse&quot; (French, literally &quot;beautiful dance&quot;), however it is often referred to casually as &quot;baroque dance&quot; in spite of the existence of other theatrical and social dance styles during the baroque era.

Primary sources include more than three hundred choreographies in Beauchamp–Feuillet notation, as well as manuals by Raoul Auger Feuillet and Pierre Rameau in France, Kellom Tomlinson, P. Siris, and John Weaver in England, and Gottfried Taubert in Germany (i.e. Leipzig, Saxony). This wealth of evidence has allowed modern scholars and dancers to recreate the style, although areas of controversy still exist. The standard modern introduction is Hilton.

French dance types include:

* Allemande (Descendant of a traditional German dances)
* Bourrée
* Canarie (Canary) (Of Spanish origin)
* Chaconne (Actually of Spanish origin)
* (French) Courante
* Entrée grave
* Forlane (Forlana)
* Gavotte
* Gigue
* Loure (slow gigue)
* Menuet (minuet)
* Musette
* Passacaille or Pasacalle (passacaglia) (Of Spanish origin, traditionally a guitar piece)
* Passepied
* Polonaise (Of Polish origin)
* Rigaudon
* Sarabande (Of Spanish origin)
* Tambourin
The English, working in the French style, added their own hornpipe to this list.

Many of these dance types are familiar from baroque music, perhaps most spectacularly in the stylized suites of J. S. Bach. Note, however, that the allemandes, that occur in these suites do not correspond to a French dance from the same period.

== Theatrical dance ==
The French noble style was danced both at social events and by professional dancers in theatrical productions such as opera-ballets and court entertainments. However, 18th-century theatrical dance had at least two other styles: comic or grotesque, and semi-serious.

== Other social dance styles ==
Other dance styles, such as the Italian and Spanish dances of the period, are much less well studied than either English country dance or the French style. The general picture seems to be that during most of the 17th century, a style of late Renaissance dance was widespread, but as time progressed, French ballroom dances such as the minuet were widely adopted at fashionable courts. Beyond this, the evolution and cross-fertilisation of dance styles is an area of ongoing research.

== Modern reconstructions ==

The revival of baroque music in the 1960s and &#x27;70s sparked renewed interest in 17th and 18th century dance styles. While some 300 of these dances had been preserved in Beauchamp–Feuillet notation, it wasn&#x27;t until the mid-20th century that serious scholarship commenced in deciphering the notation and reconstructing the dances.

Perhaps best known among these pioneers was Britain&#x27;s Melusine Wood, who published several books on historical dancing in the 1950s. Wood passed her research on to her student Belinda Quirey, and also to Pavlova Company ballerina and choreographer Mary Skeaping (1902–1984). The latter became well known for her reconstructions of baroque ballets for London&#x27;s &quot;Ballet for All&quot; company in the 1960s.

The leading figures of the second generation of historical dance research include Shirley Wynne and her Baroque Dance Ensemble which was founded at Ohio State University in the early 1970s and Wendy Hilton (1931–2002), a student of Belinda Quirey who supplemented the work of Melusine Wood with her own research into original sources.
A native of Britain, Hilton arrived in the U.S. in 1969 joining the faculty of the Juilliard School in 1972 and establishing her own baroque dance workshop at Stanford University in 1974 which endured for more than 25 years.

Catherine Turocy (b. circa 1950) began her studies in Baroque dance in 1971 as a student of dance historian Shirley Wynne. She founded The New York Baroque Dance Company in 1976 with Ann Jacoby, and the company has since toured internationally. In 1982/83 as part of the French national celebration of Jean Philippe Rameau&#x27;s 300th birthday, Turocy choreographed the first production of Jean-Philippe Rameau&#x27;s &quot;Les Boréades&quot; - it was never performed during the composer&#x27;s lifetime. This French supported production with John Eliot Gardiner, conductor, and his orchestra was directed by Jean Louis Martinoty. Turocy has been decorated as Chevalier in the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government.

In 1973, French dance historian Francine Lancelot (1929–2003) began her formal studies in ethnomusicology which later led her to research French traditional dance forms and eventually Renaissance and Baroque dances. In 1980, at the invitation of the French Minister of Culture, she founded the baroque dance company &quot;Ris et Danceries&quot;. Her work in choreographing the landmark 1986 production of Lully&#x27;s 1676 tragedie-lyrique &quot;Atys&quot; was part of the national celebration of the 300th anniversary of Lully&#x27;s death. This production propelled the career of William Christie and his ensemble Les Arts Florissants. Since the Ris et Danseries company was disbanded circa 1993, choreographers from the company have continued with their own work. Béatrice Massin with her &quot;Compagnie Fetes Galantes&quot;, along with Marie-Geneviève Massé and her company &quot;L&#x27;Eventail&quot; are among the most prominent. In 1995 Francine Lancelot&#x27;s catalogue raisonné of baroque dance, entitled &quot;La Belle Dance&quot;, was published.

<doc id="4764" wikidata="Q37866" url="?curid=4764" title="Borzoi">
<text>The Borzoi or Russian Hunting Sighthound is a Russian breed of hunting dog of sighthound type. It was formerly used for wolf hunting, and until 1936 was known as the Russian Wolfhound.

== Etymology ==

The system by which Russians over the ages named their sighthounds was a series of descriptive terms rather than actual names.  is the masculine singular form of an archaic Russian adjective that means &#x27;fast&#x27;. (&#x27;fast dog&#x27;) is the basic term for sighthounds used by Russians, though is usually dropped. The name derived from the word , which means &#x27;wavy, silky coat&#x27;, just as (as in hortaya borzaya) means shorthaired. In modern Russian, the breed commonly called the Borzoi is officially known as . Other Russian sighthound breeds are (from the steppe), called ; and (from the Crimea), called .

== History ==

The Borzoi originated in the sixteenth century Russia by crossing Saluki and European sighthounds with thick-coated Russian breeds.

The Borzoi was popular with the Tsars before the 1917 revolution. For centuries, Borzois could not be purchased but only given as gifts from the Tsar. Grand Duke Nicholas Nicolaievich of Russia bred countless Borzoi at Perchino, his private estate.

The Russkaya Psovaya Borzaya was definitively accepted by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale in 1956.

== Description ==

=== Appearance ===
Borzois are large Russian sighthounds that resemble some central Asian breeds such as the Afghan hound, Saluki, and the Kyrgyz Taigan. Borzois come in a variety of colours. The Borzoi coat is silky and flat, often wavy or slightly curly. The long top-coat is quite flat, with varying degrees of waviness or curling. The soft undercoat thickens during winter or in cold climates, but is shed in hot weather to prevent overheating. In its texture and distribution over the body, the Borzoi coat is unique. There should be a frill on its neck, as well as feathering on its hindquarters and tail.

=== Temperament ===

The Borzoi is an affectionate and athletic breed of dog with a calm temperament. 

In terms of obedience, Borzois are selective learners who quickly become bored with repetitive activity, and they can be difficult to motivate. Nevertheless, Borzois are definitely capable of enjoying and performing well in competitive obedience and agility trials with the right kind of training.

==Coat gallery==


== Health ==
A 2024 UK study found an average life expectancy of 12 years for Borzois, with a sample size of 43, compared to 12.7 for purebreds and 12 for mongrels.

An American study looking at echocardiographs of clinically healthy Borzoi found 53.8% to have heart murmurs, 30.2% to have trace or mild mitral regurgitation, 36.1% to have mild tricuspid regurgitation, and 14.4% to have cardiac disease.

<text>The Basenji () is a breed of hunting dog created from stock that originated in Central Africa, including in the Republic of the Congo and other adjacent tropical African countries. The Fédération Cynologique Internationale places the Basenji in the Spitz and &quot;primitive types&quot; categories, while the American Kennel Club classifies it as a hound. The breed does not bark in the traditional manner of most dogs, rather vocalising in an unusual, yodel-like &quot;talking&quot; sound, due to its unusually-shaped larynx. This trait earns the Basenji its nickname of &quot;barkless&quot; dog, a similar feature seen and heard in the New Guinea singing dog.

Basenjis are athletic small dogs that can run up to , and share many distinctive traits with the pye or pariah dog types of the Indian subcontinent. In addition to their uniquely similar vocalisations, the Basenji, the Australian dingo and the aforementioned New Guinea singing dog all only come-into estrus once per year, as does the Tibetan Mastiff; other dog breeds may have two or more breeding seasons each year. Basenjis lack a distinctive odor, or &quot;dog smell&quot;.

==Name==
In Swahili, translates to &quot;savage dog&quot;. Another local name is &quot;m&#x27;bwa m&#x27;kube, &#x27;mbwa wa mwitu&quot; &quot;wild dog&quot;, or &quot;dog that jumps up and down&quot;, a reference to their tendency to jump straight up to spot their quarry.

The dogs are also known to the Azande of South Sudan as .

==Lineage==
The Basenji has been identified as a basal breed that predates the emergence of the modern breeds in the 19th century. DNA studies based on whole-genome sequences indicate that the basenji and the dingo are both considered to be basal members of the domestic dog clade.

In 2021, the genome of two basenjis were assembled, which indicated that the basenji fell within the Asian spitz group. The AMY2B gene produces an enzyme, amylase, that helps to digest starch. The wolf, the husky and the dingo possess only two copies of this gene, which provides evidence that they arose before the expansion of agriculture. The genomic study found that similarly, the basenji possesses only two copies of this gene.

==History==
The Basenji originated on the continent of Africa, where it has been identified with Egyptian depictions of dogs with curled tails and erect ears, a breed called Tesem which is found in murals as old as 4,500 years.

Europeans first described the breed which became the Basenji in 1895 in the Congo. These dogs were prized by locals for their intelligence, courage, speed, and silence.

Several attempts were made to introduce the breed into England, but the earliest imports succumbed to disease. In 1923 six Basenjis were taken from Sudan, but all six died from distemper shots received in quarantine. It was not until the 1930s that foundation stock was successfully established in England, and then in the United States by animal importer Henry Trefflich. It is likely that nearly all the Basenjis in the Western world are descended from these few original imports. The breed was officially accepted into the AKC in 1943. In 1990, the AKC stud book was reopened to 14 new imports at the request of the Basenji Club of America. The stud book was reopened again to selected imported dogs from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2013. An American-led expedition collected breeding stock in villages in the Basankusu area of the Democratic Republic of Congo, in 2010. Basenjis are also registered with the United Kennel Club.

The popularity of the Basenji in the United States, according to the American Kennel Club, has declined over the past decade, with the breed ranked 71st in 1999, decreasing to 84th in 2006, and to 93rd in 2011.

==Characteristics==
===Appearance===



Basenjis are small, short-haired dogs with erect ears, tightly curled tails and graceful necks. A Basenji&#x27;s forehead is wrinkled, even more so when it is young or extremely excited. A Basenji&#x27;s eyes are typically almond-shaped. Basenjis typically weigh about and stand at the shoulder. They are a square breed, which means they are as long as they are tall with males usually larger than females. Basenjis are athletic dogs, and deceptively powerful for their size.

The FCI standard states that when moving their legs should be: &#x27;carried straight forward with a swift, long, tireless, swinging stride.&#x27; Basenjis come in a few different colorations: red, black, tricolor, and brindle, and they all have white feet, chests and tail tips.
===Temperament and behavior===

The Basenji is alert, energetic, curious and reserved with strangers. The Basenji tends to become emotionally attached to a single human. Basenjis may not get along with non-canine pets. Basenjis dislike wet weather, much like cats, and will often refuse to go outside in any sort of damp conditions. They like to climb, and can easily scale chain wire/link fences.

Basenjis often stand on their hind legs, somewhat like a meerkat, by themselves or leaning on something; this behavior is often observed when the dog is curious about something. Basenjis have a strong prey drive. According to the book &quot;The Intelligence of Dogs&quot;, they are the second least trainable dog, when required to do human commands (behind only the Afghan Hound). Their real intelligence manifests when they are required to actually solve problems for the sake of the dogs&#x27; own goals (such as food, or freedom).

Basenjis are highly prey driven and will go after cats and other small animals.

==Health==
There is only one completed health survey of dog breeds, including the Basenji, that was conducted by the UK Kennel Club in 2004. The survey indicated the prevalence of diseases in Basenjis with dermatitis (9% of responses), incontinence and bladder infection (5%), hypothyroidism (4%), pyometra and infertility (4%).

===Longevity===
Basenjis in the 2004 UK Kennel Club survey had a median lifespan of 13.6 years (sample size of 46 deceased dogs), which is 1–2 years longer than the median lifespan of other breeds of similar size. The oldest dog in the survey was 17.5 years. The most common causes of death were old age (30%), urologic (incontinence, Fanconi syndrome, chronic kidney failure 13%), behavior (&quot;unspecified&quot; and aggression 9%), and cancer (9%).

===Fanconi syndrome===
Fanconi syndrome, an inheritable disorder in which the renal (kidney) tubes fail to reabsorb electrolytes and nutrients, is unusually common in Basenjis. Symptoms include excessive drinking, excessive urination, and glucose in the urine, which may lead to a misdiagnosis of diabetes. Fanconi syndrome usually presents between 4 and 8 years of age, but sometimes as early as 3 years or as late as 10 years. Fanconi syndrome is treatable and organ damage is reduced if treatment begins early. Basenji owners are advised to test their dog&#x27;s urine for glucose once a month beginning at the age of 3 years. Glucose testing strips designed for human diabetics are inexpensive and available at most pharmacies. A Fanconi disease management protocol has been developed that can be used by veterinarians to treat Fanconi-afflicted dogs.

===Other Basenji health issues===
Basenjis sometimes carry a simple recessive gene that, when homozygous for the defect, causes genetic hemolytic anemia. Most 21st-century Basenjis are descended from ancestors that have tested clean. When lineage from a fully tested line (set of ancestors) cannot be completely verified, the dog should be tested before breeding. As this is a non-invasive DNA test, a Basenji can be tested for HA at any time.

Basenjis sometimes suffer from hip dysplasia, resulting in loss of mobility and arthritis-like symptoms. All dogs should be tested by either OFA or PennHIP prior to breeding.

Malabsorption, or immunoproliferative enteropathy, is an autoimmune intestinal disease that leads to anorexia, chronic diarrhea, and even death. A special diet can improve the quality of life for afflicted dogs.

The breed can also fall victim to progressive retinal atrophy (a degeneration of the retina causing blindness) and several less serious hereditary eye problems such as coloboma (a hole in the eye structure), and persistent pupillary membrane (tiny threads across the pupil).

==In popular culture==
* In Nyanga mythology, Rukuba was a talking Basenji and the pet of the fire god Nyamuriri. A man named either Nkhango or Mikhango convinced Rukuba to help him steal fire for his people. Angered by this, Nyamuriri sent his dog away. In some versions, he also takes the dog&#x27;s ability to speak. In most versions, Rukuba is still able to speak when he goes to live with the Nyanga, but refuses to do so anymore once Nkhango tries to make him a messenger for the village.
* The title character of the 1954 novel &quot;Good-bye, My Lady&quot;, by James H. Street, is a Basenji (female). The book was made into a film of the same name in 1956, with a cast that included Brandon deWilde, Walter Brennan, and Sidney Poitier. Several Basenjis were used in the lead role, the main &quot;star&quot; being &quot;My Lady of the Congo&quot; a six-month-old Basenji bred by Veronica Tudor-Williams of Molesey, England. She was followed by four other young Basenjis to act as doubles including her sibling, &quot;My Lord of the Congo&quot;, and &quot;Flageolet of the Congo&quot;, (who would become an International Champion). &quot;My Lady&quot; did most of the scenes.
* The true story of a Basenji was featured in the episode &quot;The Cat Came Back&quot; on the radio program &quot;This American Life&quot;.
* Basenjis are featured in the fourth episode (&quot;Tyler Tucker, I Presume?&quot;) of the third season of the animated television series &quot;The Wild Thornberrys&quot;. Nigel Thornberry encounters a group of tribesmen along with their Congolese hunting dogs. The series&#x27;s director, Mark Risley, owns several Basenjis, and his dogs provided the recorded voices for their animated counterparts.
* An episode of &quot;Pound Puppies&quot;, &quot;The Pups Who Loved Me&quot;, revolves around a Basenji secret agent character by the name of Bondo. The dog is drawn with an appropriate likeness, but appears to bark, which is uncharacteristic of the breed.
* Basenjis are featured in the first part of &quot;The Apu Trilogy&quot; (India).
* A Basenji dog is one of the main protagonists of the novel &quot;August Magic&quot; by Veronica Anne Starbuck.
* Anubis, the barkless dog, is a Basenji dog featured in the horror movies &quot;Soulmate&quot; and &quot;Tales of Halloween&quot;. 
* &quot;Yodels, Wails and Basenji Tails&quot; – the 1998 book that features a compilation of Basenji stories.
* &quot;The Story of Tongdaeng&quot; by His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand features one of his pets Tongdaeng, the Basenji dog.
* &quot;So Quiet on the Canine Front&quot; and &quot;Trader Hound&quot;, movie shorts of the &quot;Dogville Comedies&quot; series, contain trained dogs as actors, two of which are Basenjis.

<doc id="4768" wikidata="Q848599" url="?curid=4768" title="Brit milah">
<text>The brit milah (, , ; &quot;covenant of circumcision&quot;) or bris (, ) is the ceremony of circumcision in Judaism and Samaritanism, during which the foreskin is surgically removed. According to the Book of Genesis, God commanded the biblical patriarch Abraham to be circumcised, an act to be followed by his male descendants on the eighth day of life, symbolizing the covenant between God and the Jewish people. Today, it is generally performed by a mohel on the eighth day after the infant&#x27;s birth and is followed by a celebratory meal known as &quot;seudat mitzvah&quot;.

&quot;Brit Milah&quot; is considered among the most important and central commandments in Judaism, and the rite has played a central role in the formation and history of Jewish civilization. The Talmud, when discussing the importance of &quot;Brit Milah&quot;, considers it equal to all other &quot;mitzvot&quot; (commandments). Abraham’s descendents who voluntarily fail to undergo &quot;Brit Milah&quot;, barring extraordinary circumstances, are believed to suffer &quot;Kareth,&quot; in Jewish theology it&#x27;s the extinction of the soul and denial of a share in the world to come. Brit is understood by Jews to signify acceptance into the covenant between God and the Jewish people, Which is why Gerim need to go through brit even if they aren&#x27;t from Abraham’s descendents. 

Historical conflicts between Jews and European civilizations have occurred several times over &quot;Brit Milah&quot;, including multiple campaigns of Jewish ethnic, cultural, and religious persecution, with subsequent bans and restrictions on the practice as an attempted means of forceful assimilation, conversion, and ethnocide, most famously in the Maccabean Revolt by the Seleucid Empire. &quot;In Jewish history, the banning of circumcision (&quot;brit mila&quot;) has historically been a first step toward more extreme and violent forms of persecution&quot;. These periods have generally been linked to suppression of Jewish religious, ethnic, and cultural identity and subsequent &quot;punishment at the hands of government authorities for engaging in circumcision&quot;. The Maccabee victory in the Maccabean Revolt — ending the prohibition against circumcision — is celebrated in Hanukkah. Circumcision rates are near-universal among Jews.

&quot;Brit Milah&quot; also has immense importance in other religions. The Gospel of Luke records that Mary and Joseph, the parents of Jesus, had him undergo circumcision.

== Origins (unknown to 515 BCE) ==
The origin of circumcision is not known with certainty; however, artistic and literary evidence from ancient Egypt suggests it was practiced in the ancient Near East from at least the Sixth Dynasty (–2181 BCE). According to some scholars, it appears that it only appeared as a sign of the covenant during the Babylonian Exile. Scholars who posit the existence of a hypothetical J source (likely composed during the seventh century BCE) of the Pentateuch in hold that it would not have mentioned a covenant that involves the practice of circumcision. Only in the P source (likely composed during the sixth century BCE) of does the notion of circumcision become linked to a covenant.

Some scholars have argued that it originated as a replacement for child sacrifice.

== Biblical references ==
According to the Hebrew Bible, Adonai commanded the biblical patriarch Abraham to be circumcised, an act to be followed by his descendants:
Leviticus 12:3 says: &quot;And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.&quot;

According to the Hebrew Bible, it was &quot;a reproach&quot; for an Israelite to be uncircumcised. The plural term (&quot;uncircumcised&quot;) is used , denoting the Philistines and other non-Israelites and used in conjunction with (unpure) for heathen. The word (&quot;uncircumcised&quot; [singular]) is also employed for &quot;impermeable&quot;; it is also applied to the first three years&#x27; fruit of a tree, which is forbidden.

However, the Israelites born in the wilderness after the Exodus from Egypt were not circumcised. Joshua 5:2–9, explains, &quot;all the people that came out&quot; of Egypt were circumcised, but those &quot;born in the wilderness&quot; were not. Therefore, Joshua, before the celebration of the Passover, had them circumcised at Gilgal specifically before they entered Canaan. Abraham, too, was circumcised when he moved into Canaan.

The prophetic tradition emphasizes that God expects people to be good as well as pious, and that non-Jews will be judged based on their ethical behavior, see Noahide Law. Thus, Jeremiah 9:25–26 says that circumcised and uncircumcised will be punished alike by the Lord; for &quot;all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart&quot;.

The penalty of willful non-observance is &quot;kareth&quot; (making oneself liable to extirpation or excommunication), as noted in Genesis 17:1-14. Conversion to Judaism for non-Israelites in Biblical times necessitated circumcision, otherwise one could not partake in the Passover offering. Today, as in the time of Abraham, it is required of converts in Orthodox, Conservative and Reform Judaism.

As found in Genesis 17:1–14, &quot;brit milah&quot; is considered to be so important that should the eighth day fall on the Sabbath, actions that would normally be forbidden because of the sanctity of the day are permitted in order to fulfill the requirement to circumcise. The Talmud, when discussing the importance of Milah, compares it to being equal to all other mitzvot (commandments) based on the gematria for &quot;brit&quot; of 612.

Covenants in biblical times were often sealed by severing an animal, with the implication that the party who breaks the covenant will suffer a similar fate. In Hebrew, the verb meaning &quot;to seal a covenant&quot; translates literally as &quot;to cut&quot;. It is presumed by Jewish scholars that the removal of the foreskin symbolically represents such a sealing of the covenant.

Speculated reasons for biblical circumcision include to show off &quot;patrilineal descent, sexual fertility, male initiation, cleansing of birth impurity, and dedication to God&quot;.

== Ceremony ==
=== Mohalim ===
Mohalim are Jews trained in the practice of &quot;brit milah&quot;, the &quot;covenant of circumcision&quot;. According to traditional Jewish law, in the absence of a grown free Jewish male expert, anyone who has the required skills is also authorized to perform the circumcision, if they are Jewish. Yet, most streams of non-Orthodox Judaism allow women to be (, plural of , feminine of ), without restriction. In 1984, Deborah Cohen became the first certified Reform ; she was certified by the Berit Mila program of Reform Judaism.
=== Time and place ===

It is customary for the brit to be held in a synagogue, but it can also be held at home or any other suitable location. The brit is performed on the eighth day from the baby&#x27;s birth, taking into consideration that according to the Jewish calendar, the day begins at the sunset of the day before. If the baby is born on Sunday before sunset, the brit will be held the following Sunday. However, if the baby is born on Sunday night after sunset, the brit is on the following Monday. The brit takes place on the eighth day following birth even if that day is Shabbat or a holiday; however, if the baby is born on Friday night between sunset and nightfall, the Berit is delayed until the following Sunday. Furthermore, the berit is performed on the Sabbath only if it is a natural birth; if the birth is a Caesarean section, the berit is delayed until Sunday. A brit is traditionally performed in the morning, but it may be performed any time during daylight hours.

==== Postponement for health reasons ====

The Talmud explicitly instructs that a boy must not be circumcised if he had two brothers who died due to complications arising from their circumcisions, and Maimonides says that this excluded paternal half-brothers. This may be due to a concern about hemophilia.

An Israeli study found a high rate of urinary tract infections if the bandage is left on too long.

If the child is born prematurely or has other serious medical problems, the brit milah will be postponed until the doctors and mohel deem the child strong enough for his foreskin to be surgically removed.

==== Adult circumcision ====
In recent years, the circumcision of adult Jews who were not circumcised as infants has become more common than previously thought. In such cases, the brit milah will be done at the earliest date that can be arranged. The actual circumcision will be private, and other elements of the ceremony (e.g., the celebratory meal) may be modified to accommodate the desires of the one being circumcised.

==== Circumcision for the dead ====
According to Halacha, a baby who dies before they had time to circumcise him must be circumcised before burial. Several reasons were given for this commandment. Some have written that there is no need for this circumcision.

=== Anesthetic ===
Most prominent &quot;acharonim&quot; rule that the &quot;mitzvah&quot; of brit milah lies in the pain it causes, and anesthetic, sedation, or ointment should generally not be used. However, it is traditionally common to feed the infant a drop of wine or other sweet liquid to soothe him.

Eliezer Waldenberg, Yechiel Yaakov Weinberg, Shmuel Wosner, Moshe Feinstein and others agree that the child should not be sedated, although pain relieving ointment may be used under certain conditions; Shmuel Wosner particularly asserts that the act ought to be painful, per Psalm 44:23.

In a letter to the editor published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on January 3, 1998, Rabbi Moshe David Tendler disagrees with the above and writes, &quot;It is a biblical prohibition to cause anyone unnecessary pain.&quot; Rabbi Tendler recommends the use of an analgesic cream. Lidocaine should not be used, however, because lidocaine has been linked to several pediatric near-death episodes.

=== Kvatter ===
The title of &quot;&quot; () among Ashkenazi Jews is for the person who carries the baby from the mother to the father, who in turn carries him to the &quot;mohel.&quot; This honor is usually given to a couple without children, as a merit or &quot;segula&quot; (efficacious remedy) that they should have children of their own. The origin of the term is Middle High German &quot;gevater/gevatere&quot; (&quot;godfather&quot;).
=== Seudat mitzvah ===
After the ceremony, a celebratory meal takes place. At the &quot;birkat hamazon&quot;, according to the Eastern Asheknazic rite, additional introductory lines, known as &quot;Nodeh Leshimcha&quot;, are added. These lines praise God and request the permission of God, the Torah, Kohanim and distinguished people present to proceed with the grace. When the four main blessings are concluded, special &quot;ha-Rachaman&quot; prayers are recited. They request various blessings by God that include:
# the parents of the baby, to help them raise him wisely;
# the &quot;sandek&quot; (companion of child);
# the baby boy to have strength and grow up to trust in God and perceive Him three times a year;
# the &quot;mohel&quot; for unhesitatingly performing the ritual;
# to send the Messiah in Judaism speedily in the merit of this &quot;mitzvah&quot;;
# to send Elijah the prophet, known as &quot;The Righteous Kohen&quot;, so that God&#x27;s covenant can be fulfilled with the re-establishment of the throne of King David.

According to the Western Ashkenazic rite, &quot;Nodeh Leshimcha&quot; is not recited. &quot;Elohim tzivita li-yedidcha bechiracha&quot; is recited during the second blessing, and a set of &quot;ha-Rachaman&quot; prayers, different from the ones in the Eastern Ashkenazic rite, are recited.

== Ritual components ==

=== Uncovering, &quot;priah&quot; ===
At the neonatal stage, the inner preputial epithelium is still linked with the surface of the glans.
The &quot;mitzvah&quot; is executed only when this epithelium is either removed, or permanently peeled back to uncover the glans.
On medical circumcisions performed by surgeons, the epithelium is removed along with the foreskin, to prevent post operative penile adhesion and its complications.
However, on ritual circumcisions performed by a mohel, the epithelium is most commonly peeled off only after the foreskin has been amputated. This procedure is called &quot;priah&quot; (), which means &#x27;uncovering&#x27;. The main goal of &quot;priah&quot; (also known as &quot;bris periah&quot;), is to remove as much of the inner layer of the foreskin as possible and prevent the movement of the shaft skin, what creates the look and function of what is known as a &quot;low and tight&quot; circumcision.

According to Rabbinic interpretation of traditional Jewish sources, the &#x27;priah&#x27; has been performed as part of the Jewish circumcision since the Israelites first inhabited the Land of Israel.

The &quot;Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion&quot; states that many Hellenistic Jews attempted to restore their foreskins, and that similar action was taken during the Hadrianic persecution, a period in which a prohibition against circumcision was issued. The writers of the dictionary hypothesize that the more severe method practiced today was probably begun in order to prevent the possibility of restoring the foreskin after circumcision, and therefore the rabbis added the requirement of cutting the foreskin in periah.

According to Shaye J. D. Cohen, the Torah only commands milah. David Gollaher has written that the rabbis added the procedure of priah to discourage men from trying to restore their foreskins: &quot;Once established, priah was deemed essential to circumcision; if the mohel failed to cut away enough tissue, the operation was deemed insufficient to comply with God&#x27;s covenant&quot;, and &quot;Depending on the strictness of individual rabbis, boys (or men thought to have been inadequately cut) were subjected to additional operations.&quot;
=== &quot;&quot; ===
:note: alternate spellings Metzizah or Metsitsah are also used to refer to this.

In the Metzitzah (), the guard is slid over the foreskin as close to the glans as possible to allow for maximum removal of the former without any injury to the latter. A scalpel is used to detach the foreskin. A tube is used for &quot;metzitzah&quot;
In addition to &#x27; (the initial cut amputating the akroposthion) and &#x27; and subsequent circumcision, mentioned above, the Talmud (Mishnah Shabbat 19:2) mentions a third step, &quot;&quot;, translated as suction, as one of the steps involved in the circumcision rite. The Talmud writes that a &quot;Mohel (Circumciser) who does not suck creates a danger, and should be dismissed from practice&quot;. Rashi on that Talmudic passage explains that this step is in order to draw some blood from deep inside the wound to prevent danger to the baby.
There are other modern antiseptic and antibiotic techniques—all used as part of the &quot;brit milah&quot; today—which many say accomplish the intended purpose of &quot;metzitzah&quot;, however, since &quot;metzitzah&quot; is one of the four steps to fulfill Mitzvah, it continues to be practiced by Orthodox, Ultraorthodox and Hassidic Jews.

==== &quot;&quot; (oral suction) ====
The traditional method of performing &quot;metzitzah b&#x27;peh&quot; (, abbreviated as MBP)—or oral suction—has become controversial. The process has the &quot;mohel&quot; place his mouth directly on the infant&#x27;s genital wound to draw blood away from the cut. Many circumcision ceremonies no longer use metzitzah b&#x27;peh, but Haredi Jews continue to perform it, while traditional Karaites and Beta Israel never practiced it. The practice poses a serious risk of spreading herpes to the infant. Proponents maintain that there is no conclusive evidence that links herpes to &quot;Metzitza&quot;, and that attempts to limit this practice infringe on religious freedom.

The practice has become a controversy in both secular and Jewish medical ethics. The ritual of &quot;metzitzah&quot; is found in Mishnah Shabbat 19:2, which lists it as one of the four steps involved in the circumcision rite. Rabbi Moses Sofer, also known as the Chatam Sofer (1762–1839), observed that the Talmud states that the rationale for this part of the ritual was hygienic — i.e., to protect the health of the child. As such, the Chatam Sofer issued a ruling to perform &quot;metzitzah&quot; with a sponge instead of oral suction in order to safeguard the child from potential risks. He also cited a passage in Nedarim 32a as a warrant for the position that metzitzah b’peh was not an obligatory part of the circumcision ceremony. It relates the story that a mohel (who was suspected of transmitting herpes via metzizah to infants) was checked several times and never found to have signs of the disease and that a ban was requested because of the &quot;possibility of future infections&quot;. Moshe Schick (1807–1879), a student of Moses Sofer, states in his book of Responsa, &quot;She’eilos u’teshuvos Maharam Schick&quot; (Orach Chaim 152,) that Moses Sofer gave the ruling in that specific instance only because the mohel refused to step down and had secular government connections that prevented his removal in favor of another mohel, and the Heter may not be applied elsewhere. He also states (&quot;Yoreh Deah&quot; 244) that the practice is possibly a Sinaitic tradition, i.e., Halacha l&#x27;Moshe m&#x27;Sinai. Other sources contradict this claim, with copies of Moses Sofer&#x27;s responsa making no mention of the legal case or of his ruling applying in only one situation. Rather, that responsa makes quite clear that &quot;metzizah&quot; was a health measure and should never be employed where there is a health risk to the infant.

Chaim Hezekiah Medini, after corresponding with the greatest Jewish sages of the generation, concluded the practice to be Halacha l&#x27;Moshe m&#x27;Sinai and elaborates on what prompted Moses Sofer to give the above ruling. He tells the story that a student of Moses Sofer, Lazar Horowitz, Chief Rabbi of Vienna at the time and author of the responsa &quot;Yad Elazer&quot;, needed the ruling because of a governmental attempt to ban circumcision completely if it included &quot;metztitzah b&#x27;peh.&quot; He therefore asked Sofer to give him permission to do &quot;brit milah&quot; without &quot;metzitzah b&#x27;peh.&quot; When he presented the defense in secular court, his testimony was erroneously recorded to mean that Sofer stated it as a general ruling. The Rabbinical Council of America (RCA), which claims to be the largest American organization of Orthodox rabbis, published an article by mohel Yehudi Pesach Shields in its summer 1972 issue of &quot;Tradition&quot; magazine, calling for the abandonment of Metzitzah b&#x27;peh. Since then the RCA has issued an opinion that advocates methods that do not involve contact between the mohel&#x27;s mouth and the infant&#x27;s genitals, such as the use of a sterile syringe, thereby eliminating the risk of infection. According to the Chief Rabbinate of Israel and the Edah HaChareidis &quot;metzitzah b&#x27;peh&quot; should still be performed.

The practice of &quot;metzitzah b&#x27;peh&quot; posed a serious risk in the transfer of herpes from mohelim to eight Israeli infants, one of whom suffered brain damage. When three New York City infants contracted herpes after &quot;metzizah b&#x27;peh&quot; by one &quot;mohel&quot; and one of them died, New York authorities took out a restraining order against the &quot;mohel&quot; requiring use of a sterile glass tube, or pipette. The mohel&#x27;s attorney argued that the New York Department of Health had not supplied conclusive medical evidence linking his client with the disease. In September 2005, the city withdrew the restraining order and turned the matter over to a rabbinical court. Thomas Frieden, the Health Commissioner of New York City, wrote, &quot;There exists no reasonable doubt that &#x27;metzitzah b&#x27;peh&#x27; can and has caused neonatal herpes infection...The Health Department recommends that infants being circumcised not undergo metzitzah b&#x27;peh.&quot; In May 2006, the Department of Health for New York State issued a protocol for the performance of metzitzah b&#x27;peh. Antonia Novello, Commissioner of Health for New York State, together with a board of rabbis and doctors, worked, she said, to &quot;allow the practice of metzizah b&#x27;peh to continue while still meeting the Department of Health&#x27;s responsibility to protect the public health&quot;. Later in New York City in 2012 a 2-week-old baby died of herpes because of metzitzah b&#x27;peh.

In three medical papers done in Israel, Canada, and the US, oral suction following circumcision was suggested as a cause in 11 cases of neonatal herpes. Researchers noted that prior to 1997, neonatal herpes reports in Israel were rare, and that the late instances were correlated with the mothers carrying the virus themselves. Rabbi Doctor Mordechai Halperin implicates the &quot;better hygiene and living conditions that prevail among the younger generation&quot;, which lowered to 60% the rate of young Israeli Haredi mothers who carry the virus. He explains that an &quot;absence of antibodies in the mothers&#x27; blood means that their newborn sons received no such antibodies through the placenta, and therefore are vulnerable to infection by HSV-1&quot;.

==== Barriers ====
Because of the risk of infection, some rabbinical authorities have ruled that the traditional practice of direct contact should be replaced by using a sterile tube between the wound and the mohel&#x27;s mouth, so there is no direct oral contact. The Rabbinical Council of America, the largest group of Modern Orthodox rabbis, endorses this method. The RCA paper states: &quot;Rabbi Schachter even reports that Rav Yosef Dov Soloveitchik reports that his father, Rav Moshe Soloveitchik, would not permit a mohel to perform metzitza be’peh with direct oral contact, and that his grandfather, Rav Chaim Soloveitchik, instructed mohelim in Brisk not to do metzitza be’peh with direct oral contact. However, although Rav Yosef Dov Soloveitchik also generally prohibited metzitza be’peh with direct oral contact, he did not ban it by those who insisted upon it.&quot; The sefer Mitzvas Hametzitzah by Rabbi Sinai Schiffer of Baden, Germany, states that he is in possession of letters from 36 major Russian (Lithuanian) rabbis that categorically prohibit Metzitzah with a sponge and require it to be done orally. Among them is Rabbi Chaim Halevi Soloveitchik of Brisk.

In September 2012, the New York Department of Health unanimously ruled that the practice of metztizah b&#x27;peh should require informed consent from the parent or guardian of the child undergoing the ritual. Prior to the ruling, several hundred rabbis, including Rabbi David Niederman, the executive director of the United Jewish Organization of Williamsburg, signed a declaration stating that they would not inform parents of the potential dangers that came with metzitzah b&#x27;peh, even if informed consent became law.

In a motion for preliminary injunction with intent to sue, filed against New York City Department of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene, affidavits by Awi Federgruen, Brenda Breuer, and Daniel S. Berman argued that the study on which the department passed its conclusions is flawed.

The &quot;informed consent&quot; regulation was challenged in court. In January 2013 the U.S. District court ruled that the law did not specifically target religion and therefore must not pass strict scrutiny. The ruling was appealed to the Court of Appeals.

On August 15, 2014, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decision by the lower court, and ruled that the regulation does have to be reviewed under strict scrutiny to determine whether it infringes on Orthodox Jews&#x27; freedom of religion.

On September 9, 2015, after coming to an agreement with the community the New York City Board of Health voted to repeal the informed consent regulation.

=== Hatafat dam brit ===
A brit milah is more than circumcision; it is a sacred ritual in Judaism, as distinguished from its non-ritual requirement in Islam. One ramification is that the brit is not considered complete unless a drop of blood is actually drawn. The standard medical methods of circumcision through constriction do not meet the requirements of the halakhah for brit milah, because they are done with hemostasis, &quot;i.e.&quot;, they stop the flow of blood. Moreover, circumcision alone, in the absence of the brit milah ceremony, does not fulfill the requirements of the mitzvah. Therefore, in cases involving a Jew who was circumcised outside of a brit milah, an already-circumcised convert, or an aposthetic (born without a foreskin) individual, the mohel draws a symbolic drop of blood (, ) from the penis at the point where the foreskin would have been or was attached.

== &quot;Milah L&#x27;shem Giur&quot; ==

A &quot;milah l&#x27;shem giur&quot; is a &quot;circumcision for the purpose of conversion&quot;. In Orthodox Judaism, this procedure is usually done by adoptive parents for adopted boys who are being converted as part of the adoption or by families with young children converting together. It is also required for adult converts who were not previously circumcised, e.g., those born in countries where circumcision at birth is not common. The conversion of a minor is valid in both Orthodox and Conservative Judaism until a child reaches the age of majority (13 for a boy, 12 for a girl); at that time the child has the option of renouncing his conversion and Judaism, and the conversion will then be considered retroactively invalid. He must be informed of his right to renounce his conversion if he wishes. If he does not make such a statement, it is accepted that the boy is halakhically Jewish. Orthodox rabbis will generally not convert a non-Jewish child raised by a mother who has not converted to Judaism.

The laws of conversion and conversion-related circumcision in Orthodox Judaism have numerous complications, and authorities recommend that a rabbi be consulted well in advance.

In Conservative Judaism, the milah l&#x27;shem giur procedure is also performed for a boy whose mother has not converted, but with the intention that the child be raised Jewish. This conversion of a child to Judaism without the conversion of the mother is allowed by Conservative interpretations of halakha. Conservative Rabbis will authorize it only under the condition that the child be raised as a Jew in a single-faith household. Should the mother convert, and if the boy has not yet reached his third birthday, the child may be immersed in the mikveh with the mother, after the mother has already immersed, to become Jewish. If the mother does not convert, the child may be immersed in a mikveh, or body of natural waters, to complete the child&#x27;s conversion to Judaism. This can be done before the child is even one year old. If the child did not immerse in the mikveh, or the boy was too old, then the child may choose of their own accord to become Jewish at age 13 as a Bar Mitzvah, and complete the conversion then.
* The ceremony, when performed l&#x27;shem giur, does not have to be performed on a particular day, and does not override Shabbat and Jewish Holidays.
* In Orthodox Judaism, there is a split of authorities on whether the child receives a Hebrew name at the Brit ceremony or upon immersion in the Mikvah. According to &quot;Zichron Brit LeRishonim&quot;, naming occurs at the Brit with a different formula than the standard Brit Milah. The more common practice among Ashkenazic Jews follows Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, with naming occurring at immersion.

Where the procedure was performed but not followed by immersion or other requirements of the conversion procedure (e.g., in Conservative Judaism, where the mother has not converted), if the boy chooses to complete the conversion at Bar Mitzvah, a &quot;milah l&#x27;shem giur&quot; performed when the boy was an infant removes the obligation to undergo either a full brit milah or &quot;hatafat dam brit&quot;.

=== Visible symbol of a covenant ===
Rabbi Saadia Gaon considers something to be &quot;complete&quot; if it lacks nothing, but also has nothing that is unneeded. He regards the foreskin as an unneeded organ that God created in man, and so by amputating it, the man is completed. The author of Sefer ha-Chinuch provides three reasons for the practice of circumcision:
# To complete the form of man, by removing what he claims to be a redundant organ;
# To mark the chosen people, so that their bodies will be different as their souls are. The organ chosen for the mark is the one responsible for the sustenance of the species;
# The completion effected by circumcision is not congenital, but left to the man. This implies that as he completes the form of his body, so can he complete the form of his soul.

Talmud professor Daniel Boyarin offered two explanations for circumcision. One is that it is a literal inscription on the Jewish body of the name of God in the form of the letter &quot;yud&quot; (from &quot;yesod&quot;). The second is that the act of bleeding represents a feminization of Jewish men, significant in the sense that the covenant represents a marriage between Jews and (a symbolically male) God.

=== Other reasons ===
In &quot;Of the Special Laws, Book 1&quot;, the Jewish philosopher Philo additionally gave other reasons for the practice of circumcision.

He attributes four of the reasons to &quot;men of divine spirit and wisdom&quot;. These include the idea that circumcision:
# Protects against disease,
# Secures cleanliness &quot;in a way that is suited to the people consecrated to God&quot;,
# Causes the circumcised portion of the penis to resemble a heart, thereby representing a physical connection between the &quot;breath contained within the heart [that] is generative of thoughts, and the generative organ itself [that] is productive of living beings&quot;, and
# Promotes prolificness by removing impediments to the flow of semen.

== Judaism, Christianity, and the Early Church (4 BCE – 150 CE) ==

The 1st-century Jewish author Philo Judaeus defended Jewish circumcision on several grounds. He thought that circumcision should be done as early as possible as it would not be as likely to be done by someone&#x27;s own free will. He claimed that the foreskin prevented semen from reaching the vagina and so should be done as a way to increase the nation&#x27;s population. He also noted that circumcision should be performed as an effective means to reduce sexual pleasure.

There was also division in Pharisaic Judaism between Hillel the Elder and Shammai on the issue of circumcision of proselytes.

According to the Gospel of Luke, Jesus was circumcised on the 8th day.
According to saying 53 of the Gospel of Thomas,

The foreskin was considered a symbol of beauty, civility, and masculinity throughout the Greco-Roman world; it was customary to spend an hour or so a day exercising nude in the &quot;gymnasium&quot; and in Roman baths; many Jewish men did not want to be seen in public deprived of their foreskins, where matters of business and politics were discussed. To expose one&#x27;s glans in public was seen as indecent, vulgar, and a sign of sexual arousal and desire.

Classical, Hellenistic, and Roman culture widely found circumcision to be barbaric, cruel, and utterly repulsive in nature. By the period of the Maccabees, many Jewish men attempted to hide their circumcisions through the process of epispasm due to the circumstances of the period, although Jewish religious writers denounced these practices as abrogating the covenant of Abraham in 1 Maccabees and the Talmud. After Christianity and Second Temple Judaism split apart from one another, &quot;Milah&quot; was declared spiritually unnecessary as a condition of justification by Christian writers such as Paul the Apostle and subsequently in the Council of Jerusalem, while it further increased in importance for Jews.

In the mid-2nd century CE, the Tannaim, the successors of the newly ideologically dominant Pharisees, introduced and made mandatory a secondary step of circumcision known as the &quot;Periah.&quot; Without it circumcision was newly declared to have no spiritual value. This new form removed as much of the inner mucosa as possible, the frenulum and its corresponding delta from the penis, and prevented the movement of shaft skin, in what creates a &quot;low and tight&quot; circumcision. It was intended to make it impossible to restore the foreskin. This is the form practiced among the large majority of Jews today, and, later, became a basis for the routine neonatal circumcisions performed in the United States.

The steps, justifications, and imposition of the practice have dramatically varied throughout history; commonly cited reasons for the practice have included it being a way to control male sexuality by reducing sexual pleasure and desire, as a visual marker of the covenant of the pieces, as a metaphor for mankind perfecting creation, and as a means to promote fertility. The original version in Judaic history was either a ritual nick or cut done by a father to the &quot;acroposthion&quot;, the part of the foreskin that overhangs the glans penis. This form of genital nicking or cutting, known as simply &quot;milah,&quot; became adopted among Jews by the Second Temple period and was the predominant form until the second century CE. The notion of &quot;milah&quot; being linked to a biblical covenant is generally believed to have originated in the 6th century BCE as a product of the Babylonian captivity; the practice likely lacked this significance among Jews before the period.

== Reform Judaism ==
The Reform societies established in Frankfurt and Berlin regarded circumcision as barbaric and wished to abolish it. However, while prominent rabbis such as Abraham Geiger believed the ritual to be barbaric and outdated, they refrained from instituting any change in this matter. In 1843, when a father in Frankfurt refused to circumcise his son, rabbis of all shades in Germany stated it was mandated by Jewish law; even Samuel Holdheim affirmed this. By 1871, Reform rabbinic leadership in Germany reasserted &quot;the supreme importance of circumcision in Judaism&quot;, while affirming the traditional viewpoint that non-circumcised Jews are Jews nonetheless. Although the issue of circumcision of converts continues to be debated, the necessity of Brit Milah for Jewish infant boys has been stressed in every subsequent Reform rabbis manual or guide. While the Reform movement does not require the circumcision of adult male converts, it is increasingly acknowledged and practiced by many Reform communities as an important part of the conversion process. Since 1984 Reform Judaism has trained and certified over 300 of their own practicing &quot;mohalim&quot; in this ritual. By 2001, the Central Conference of American Rabbis began to recommend that male converts who are already circumcised undergo hatafat dam brit.

== In Samaritanism ==
Samaritan &quot;brit milah&quot; occurs on the eighth day following the child&#x27;s birth at the father&#x27;s home. In addition to special prayers and readings from the Torah pertaining to the ritual, an old hymn that invokes blessings for parents and children is sung.

According to 19th century British explorer Conder, in their circumcision hymn, Samaritans express their gratitude for a certain Roman soldier by the name of Germon, who was sent by an unknown Roman Emperor as a sentinel over the home of the Samaritan High Priest for his kindness in allowing the process of circumcision to take place. They tried to give him money, but he refused, just requesting to be included in their future prayers instead.
