<text>An architect is a person who plans, designs, and oversees the construction of buildings. To practice architecture means to provide services in connection with the design of buildings and the space within the site surrounding the buildings that have human occupancy or use as their principal purpose. Etymologically, the term architect derives from the Latin , which derives from the Greek (&quot;-&quot;, chief + , builder), i.e., chief builder.

The professional requirements for architects vary from location to location. An architect&#x27;s decisions affect public safety, and thus the architect must undergo specialised training consisting of advanced education and a &quot;practicum&quot; (or internship) for practical experience to earn a license to practice architecture. Practical, technical, and academic requirements for becoming an architect vary by jurisdiction though the formal study of architecture in academic institutions has played a pivotal role in the development of the profession.

==Origins==

Throughout ancient and medieval history, most architectural design and construction was carried out by artisans—such as stone masons and carpenters—who rose to the role of master builders. Until modern times, there was no clear distinction between architect and engineer. In Europe, the titles &quot;architect&quot; and &quot;engineer&quot; were primarily geographical variations that referred to the same person, often used interchangeably.
&quot;Architect&quot; derives from Greek (, &quot;master builder,&quot; &quot;chief ).
 It is suggested that various developments in technology and mathematics allowed the development of the professional &#x27;gentleman&#x27; architect, separate from the hands-on craftsman. Paper was not used in Europe for drawing until the 15th century but became increasingly available after 1500. Pencils were used for drawing by 1600. The availability of both paper and pencils allowed pre-construction drawings to be made by professionals. Concurrently, the introduction of linear perspective and innovations such as the use of different projections to describe a three-dimensional building in two dimensions, together with an increased understanding of dimensional accuracy, helped building designers communicate their ideas. However, development was gradual and slow-going. Until the 18th century, buildings continued to be designed and set out by craftsmen, with the exception of high-status projects.

==Architecture==

In most developed countries only those qualified with an appropriate license, certification, or registration with a relevant body (often a government) may legally practice architecture. Such licensure usually requires a university degree, successful completion of exams, and a training period. Representation of oneself as an architect through the use of terms and titles were restricted to licensed individuals by law, although in general, derivatives such as architectural designer were not legally protected.

To practice architecture implies the ability to practice independently of supervision. The term &quot;building design professional&quot; (or &quot;design professional)&quot;, by contrast, is a much broader term that includes professionals who practice independently under an alternate profession, such as engineering professionals, or those who assist in the practice of architecture under the supervision of a licensed architect, such as intern architects. In many places, independent, non-licensed individuals may perform design services outside of professional restrictions, such as the design of houses or other smaller structures.

==Practice==
In the architectural profession, technical and environmental knowledge, design, and construction management require an understanding of business as well as design. However, design is the driving force throughout the project and beyond. An architect accepts a commission from a client. The commission might involve preparing feasibility reports, building audits, and designing a building or several buildings, structures, and the spaces among them. The architect participates in developing the requirements the client wants in the building. Throughout the project (planning to occupancy), the architect coordinates a design team. Structural, mechanical, and electrical engineers are hired by the client or architect, who must ensure that the work is coordinated to construct the design.

===Design role===
The architect, once hired by a client, is responsible for creating a design concept that meets the requirements of that client and provides a facility suitable to the required use. The architect must meet with and ask questions to the client, to ascertain all the requirements (and nuances) of the planned project.

Often, the full brief is not clear in the beginning. It involves a degree of risk in the design undertaking. The architect may make early proposals to the client which may rework the terms of the brief. The &quot;program&quot; (or brief) is essential to producing a project that meets all the needs of the owner. This becomes a guide for the architect in creating the design concept.

Design proposal(s) are generally expected to be both imaginative and pragmatic. Much depends upon the time, place, finance, culture, and available crafts and technology in which the design takes place. The extent and nature of these expectations will vary. Foresight is a prerequisite when designing buildings as it is a very complex and demanding undertaking.

Any design concept during the early stage of its generation must take into account a great number of issues and variables, including the qualities of the space(s), the end-use and life-cycle of these proposed spaces, connections, relations, and aspects between spaces, including how they are put together, and the impact of proposals on the immediate and wider locality. The selection of appropriate materials and technology must be considered, tested, and reviewed at an early stage in the design to ensure there are no setbacks (such as higher-than-expected costs) which could occur later in the project.

The site and its surrounding environment, as well as the culture and history of the place, will also influence the design. The design must also balance increasing concerns with environmental sustainability. The architect may introduce (intentionally or not), aspects of mathematics and architecture, new or current architectural theory, or references to architectural history.

A key part of the design is that the architect often must consult with engineers, surveyors, and other specialists throughout the design, ensuring that aspects such as structural supports and air conditioning elements are coordinated. The control and planning of construction costs are also part of these consultations. Coordination of the different aspects involves a high degree of specialized communication, including advanced computer technology such as building information modeling (BIM), computer-aided design (CAD), and cloud-based technologies. Finally, at all times, the architect must report back to the client, who may have reservations or recommendations which might introduce further variables into the design.

Architects also deal with local and federal jurisdictions regarding regulations and building codes. The architect might need to comply with local planning and zoning laws such as required setbacks, height limitations, parking requirements, transparency requirements (windows), and land use. Some jurisdictions require adherence to design and historic preservation guidelines. Health and safety risks form a vital part of the current design, and in some jurisdictions, design reports and records are required to include ongoing considerations of materials and contaminants, waste management and recycling, traffic control, and fire safety.

====Means of design====

Previously, architects employed drawings to illustrate and generate design proposals. While conceptual sketches are still widely used by architects, computer technology has now become the industry standard. Furthermore, design may include the use of photos, collages, prints, linocuts, 3D scanning technology, and other media in design production. 
Increasingly, computer software is shaping how architects work. BIM technology allows for the creation of a virtual building that serves as an information database for the sharing of design and building information throughout the life-cycle of the building&#x27;s design, construction, and maintenance. Virtual reality (VR) presentations are becoming more common for visualizing structural designs and interior spaces from the point-of-view perspective.

===Environmental role===
Since modern buildings are known to release carbon into the atmosphere, increasing controls are being placed on buildings and associated technology to reduce emissions, increase energy efficiency, and make use of renewable energy sources. Renewable energy sources may be designed into the proposed building by local or national renewable energy providers. As a result, the architect is required to remain abreast of current regulations that are continually being updated. Some new developments exhibit extremely low energy use or passive solar building design.
However, the architect is also increasingly being required to provide initiatives in a wider environmental sense. Examples of this include making provisions for low-energy transport, natural daylighting instead of artificial lighting, natural ventilation instead of air conditioning, pollution, and waste management, use of recycled materials, and employment of materials which can be easily recycled.

===Construction role===
As the design becomes more advanced and detailed, specifications and detail designs are made of all the elements and components of the building. Techniques in the production of a building are continually advancing which places a demand on the architect to ensure that he or she remains up to date with these advances.

Depending on the client&#x27;s needs and the jurisdiction&#x27;s requirements, the spectrum of the architect&#x27;s services during each construction stage may be extensive (detailed document preparation and construction review) or less involved (such as allowing a contractor to exercise considerable design-build functions).

Architects typically put projects to tender on behalf of their clients, advise them on the award of the project to a general contractor, facilitate and administer a contract of agreement, which is often between the client and the contractor. This contract is legally binding and covers a wide range of aspects, including the insurance and commitments of all stakeholders, the status of the design documents, provisions for the architect&#x27;s access, and procedures for the control of the works as they proceed. Depending on the type of contract used, provisions for further sub-contract tenders may be required. The architect may require that some elements be covered by a warranty which specifies the expected life and other aspects of the material, product, or work.

In most jurisdictions prior notification to the relevant authority must be given before commencement of the project, giving the local authority notice to carry out independent inspections. The architect will then review and inspect the progress of the work in coordination with the local authority.

The architect will typically review contractor shop drawings and other submittals, prepare and issue site instructions, and provide Certificates for Payment to the contractor (see also Design-bid-build) which is based on the work done as well as any materials and other goods purchased or hired in the future. In the United Kingdom and other countries, a quantity surveyor is often part of the team to provide cost consulting. With large, complex projects, an independent construction manager is sometimes hired to assist in the design and management of the construction.

In many jurisdictions mandatory certification or assurance of the completed work or part of the work is required. This demand for certification entails a high degree of risk; therefore, regular inspections of the work as it progresses on site is required to ensure that the design is in compliance itself as well as following all relevant statutes and permissions.

===Alternate practice and specialisations===
Recent decades have seen the rise of specialisations within the profession. Many architects and architectural firms focus on certain project types (e.g. healthcare, retail, public housing, and event management), technological expertise, or project delivery methods. Some architects specialise in building code, building envelope, sustainable design, technical writing, historic preservation(US) or conservation (UK), and accessibility.

Many architects elect to move into real-estate (property) development, corporate facilities planning, project management, construction management, chief sustainability officers interior design, city planning, user experience design, and design research.

==Professional requirements==

Although there are variations in each location, most of the world&#x27;s architects are required to register with the appropriate jurisdiction. Architects are typically required to meet three common requirements: education, experience, and examination.

Basic educational requirement generally consist of a university in architecture. The experience requirement for degree candidates is usually satisfied by a practicum or internship (usually two to three years). Finally, a Registration Examination or a series of exams is required prior to licensure.

Professionals who engaged in the design and supervision of construction projects before the late 19th century were not necessarily trained in a separate architecture program in an academic setting. Instead, they often trained under established architects. Prior to modern times, there was no distinction between architects and engineers and the title used varied depending on geographical location. They often carried the title of master builder or surveyor after serving a number of years as an apprentice (such as Sir Christopher Wren). The formal study of architecture in academic institutions played a pivotal role in the development of the profession as a whole, serving as a focal point for advances in architectural technology and theory. The use of &quot;Architect&quot; or abbreviations such as &quot;Ar.&quot; as a title attached to a person&#x27;s name was regulated by law in some countries.

==Fees==
Architects&#x27; fee structure was typically based on a percentage of construction value, as a rate per unit area of the proposed construction, hourly rates, or a fixed lump sum fee. Combination of these structures were also common. Fixed fees were usually based on a project&#x27;s allocated construction cost and could range between 4 and 12% of new construction cost for commercial and institutional projects, depending on the project&#x27;s size and complexity. Residential projects ranged from 12 to 20%. Renovation projects typically commanded higher percentages such as 15–20%.

Overall billings for architectural firms range widely, depending on their location and economic climate. Billings have traditionally been dependent on local economic conditions, but with rapid globalization, this is becoming less of a factor for large international firms. Salaries could also vary depending on experience, position within the firm (i.e. staff architect, partner, or shareholder, etc.), and the size and location of the firm.

==Professional organizations==

A number of national professional organizations exist to promote career and business development in architecture.

* The International Union of Architects (UIA)
* The American Institute of Architects (AIA) US
* Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) UK
* Architects Registration Board (ARB) UK
* The Australian Institute of Architects (AIA) Australia
* The South African Institute of Architects (SAIA) South Africa
* Association of Consultant Architects (ACA) UK
* Association of Licensed Architects (ALA) US
* The Consejo Profesional de Arquitectura y Urbanismo (CPAU) Argentina
* Indian Institute of Architects (IIA) &amp; Council of Architecture (COA) India
* The Jamaican Institute of Architects (JIA)
* The National Organization of Minority Architects (NOMA) US

== Prizes and awards ==
A wide variety of prizes is awarded by national professional associations and other bodies, recognizing accomplished architects, their buildings, structures, and professional careers.

The most lucrative award an architect can receive is the Pritzker Prize, sometimes termed the &quot;Nobel Prize for architecture&quot;. The inaugural Pritzker Prize winner was Philip Johnson who was cited as having &quot;50 years of imagination and vitality embodied in a myriad of museums, theatres libraries, houses gardens and corporate structures&quot;. The Pritzker Prize has been awarded for forty-two straight editions without interruption, and there are now 22 countries with at least one winning architect. Other prestigious architectural awards are the Royal Gold Medal, the AIA Gold Medal (US), AIA Gold Medal (Australia), and the Praemium Imperiale.

Architects in the UK who have made contributions to the profession through design excellence or architectural education or have in some other way advanced the profession might, until 1971, be elected Fellows of the Royal Institute of British Architects and can write FRIBA after their name if they feel so inclined. Those elected to chartered membership of the RIBA after 1971 may use the initials RIBA but cannot use the old ARIBA and FRIBA. An honorary fellow may use the initials Hon. FRIBA, and an international fellow may use the initials Int. FRIBA. Architects in the US who have made contributions to the profession through design excellence or architectural education or have in some other way advanced the profession are elected Fellows of the American Institute of Architects and can write FAIA after their name. Architects in Canada who have made outstanding contributions to the profession through contributions to research, scholarship, public service, or professional standing to the good of architecture in Canada or elsewhere may be recognized as Fellows of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada and can write FRAIC after their name. In Hong Kong, those elected to chartered membership may use the initial HKIA, and those who have made a special contribution after nomination and election by the Hong Kong Institute of Architects (HKIA), may be elected as fellow members of HKIA and may use FHKIA after their name.

<doc id="1171" wikidata="Q102786" url="?curid=1171" title="Abbreviation">
<text>An abbreviation () is a shortened form of a word or phrase, by any method including shortening, contraction, initialism (which includes acronym), or crasis. An abbreviation may be a shortened form of a word, usually ended with a trailing period. For example, the term &quot;etc.&quot; is the usual abbreviation for the Latin phrase .

==Types==
A &quot;contraction&quot; is an abbreviation formed by replacing letters with an apostrophe. Examples include &quot;I&#x27;m&quot; for &quot;I am&quot; and &quot;li&#x27;l&quot; for &quot;little&quot;.

An &quot;initialism&quot; or &quot;acronym&quot; is an abbreviation consisting of the initial letter of a sequence of words without other punctuation. For example, FBI (), USA (), IBM (), BBC (). When initialism is used as the preferred term, acronym refers more specifically to when the abbreviation is pronounced as a word rather than as separate letters; examples include SWAT and NASA.

Initialisms, contractions and crasis share some semantic and phonetic functions, and are connected by the term &quot;abbreviation&quot; in loose parlance.

== History ==
In early times, abbreviations may have been common due to the effort involved in writing (many inscriptions were carved in stone) or to provide secrecy via obfuscation.

Reduction of a word to a single letter was common in both Greek and Roman writing. In Roman inscriptions, &quot;Words were commonly abbreviated by using the initial letter or letters of words, and most inscriptions have at least one abbreviation&quot;. However, &quot;some could have more than one meaning, depending on their context. (For example, can be an abbreviation for many words, such as &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, and &#x27;.)&quot; Many frequent abbreviations consisted of more than one letter: for example COS for &quot;consul&quot; and COSS for its nominative etc. plural &quot;consules&quot;.

Abbreviations were frequently used in early English. Manuscripts of copies of the Old English poem &quot;Beowulf&quot; used many abbreviations, for example the Tironian et () or for &quot;and&quot;, and for &quot;since&quot;, so that &quot;not much space is wasted&quot;. The standardisation of English in the 15th through 17th centuries included a growth in the use of such abbreviations. At first, abbreviations were sometimes represented with various suspension signs, not only periods. For example, sequences like were replaced with , as in for &quot;master&quot; and for &quot;exacerbate&quot;. While this may seem trivial, it was symptomatic of an attempt by people manually reproducing academic texts to reduce the copy time.
In the Early Modern English period, between the 15th and 17th centuries, the thorn was used for &quot;th&quot;, as in (&#x27;the&#x27;). In modern times, was often used (in the form ) for promotional reasons, as in .

During the growth of philological linguistic theory in academic Britain, abbreviating became very fashionable. Likewise, a century earlier in Boston, a fad of abbreviation started that swept the United States, with the globally popular term OK generally credited as a remnant of its influence.

Over the years, however, the lack of convention in some style guides has made it difficult to determine which two-word abbreviations should be abbreviated with periods and which should not. This question is considered below.

Widespread use of electronic communication through mobile phones and the Internet during the 1990s led to a marked rise in colloquial abbreviation. This was due largely to increasing popularity of textual communication services such as instant and text messaging. The original SMS supported message lengths of 160 characters at most (using the GSM 03.38 character set), for instance. This brevity gave rise to an informal abbreviation scheme sometimes called Textese, with which 10% or more of the words in a typical SMS message are abbreviated. More recently Twitter, a popular social networking service, began driving abbreviation use with 140 character message limits.

In HTML, abbreviations can be annotated using &lt;abbr title=&quot;Meaning of the abbreviation.&quot;&gt;abbreviation&lt;/abbr&gt; to reveal its meaning by hovering the cursor.

== Style conventions in English ==

In modern English, there are multiple conventions for abbreviation, and there is controversy as to which should be used. One generally accepted rule is to be consistent in a body of work. To this end, publishers may express their preferences in a style guide.

Some controversies that arise are described below.

=== Capitalization ===

If the original word was capitalized then the first letter of its abbreviation should retain the capital, for example Lev. for &quot;Leviticus&quot;. When a word is abbreviated to more than a single letter and was originally spelled with lower case letters then there is no need for capitalization. However, when abbreviating a phrase where only the first letter of each word is taken, then all letters should be capitalized, as in YTD for &quot;year-to-date&quot;, PCB for &quot;printed circuit board&quot; and FYI for &quot;for your information&quot;. However, see the following section regarding abbreviations that have become common vocabulary: these are no longer written with capital letters.

=== Periods ===

A period (a.k.a. full stop) is sometimes used to signify abbreviation, but opinion is divided as to when and if this convention is best practice.

According to Hart&#x27;s Rules, a word shortened by dropping letters from the end terminates with a period, whereas a word shorted by dropping letters from the middle does not. Fowler&#x27;s Modern English Usage says a period is used for both of these shortened forms, but recommends against this practice: advising it only for end-shortened words and lower-case initialisms; not for middle-shortened words and upper-case initialisms.

Some British style guides, such as for The Guardian and The Economist, disallow periods for all abbreviations.

In American English, the period is usually included regardless of whether or not it is a contraction, e.g. &quot;Dr.&quot; or &quot;Mrs.&quot;. In some cases, periods are optional, as in either &quot;US&quot; or &quot;U.S.&quot; for &quot;United States&quot;, &quot;EU&quot; or &quot;E.U.&quot; for &quot;European Union&quot;, and &quot;UN&quot; or &quot;U.N.&quot; for &quot;United Nations&quot;. There are some house styles, however—American ones included—that remove the periods from almost all abbreviations. For example:
* The U.S. Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices advises that periods should not be used with abbreviations on road signs, except for cardinal directions as part of a destination name. (For example, &quot;Northwest Blvd&quot;, &quot;W. Jefferson&quot;, and &quot;PED XING&quot; all follow this recommendation.) 
* AMA style, used in many medical journals, uses no periods in abbreviations or acronyms, with almost no exceptions. Thus eg, ie, , et al., Dr, Mr, MRI, ICU, and hundreds of others contain no periods. The only exceptions are (an abbreviation of Numero, Number), to avoid confusion with the word &quot;No&quot;; initials within persons&#x27; names (such as &quot;George R. Smith&quot;); and &quot;St.&quot; within persons&#x27; names when the person prefers it (such as &quot;Emily R. St. Clair&quot;) (but not in city names such as &quot;St Louis&quot; or &quot;St Paul&quot;).

Acronyms that were originally capitalized (with or without periods) but have since entered the vocabulary as generic words are no longer written with capital letters nor with any periods. Examples are sonar, radar, lidar, laser, snafu, and scuba.

When an abbreviation appears at the end of a sentence, only one period is used: &quot;The capital of the United States is Washington, D.C.&quot;

In the past, some initialisms were styled with a period after each letter and a space between each pair. For example, &quot;U. S.&quot;, but today this is typically &quot;US&quot;.

=== Plural ===

There are multiple ways to pluralize an abbreviation. Sometimes this accomplished by adding an apostrophe and an &quot;s&quot; (), as in &quot;two PC&#x27;s have broken screens&quot;. But, some find this confusing since the notation can indicate possessive case. And, this style is deprecated by many style guides. For instance, Kate Turabian, writing about style in academic writings, allows for an apostrophe to form plural acronyms &quot;only when an abbreviation contains internal periods or both capital and lowercase letters&quot;. For example, &quot;DVDs&quot; and &quot;URLs&quot; and &quot;Ph.D.&#x27;s&quot;, while the Modern Language Association explicitly says, &quot;do not use an apostrophe to form the plural of an abbreviation&quot;. Also, the American Psychological Association specifically says, &quot;without an apostrophe&quot;.

However, the 1999 style guide for &quot;The New York Times&quot; states that the addition of an apostrophe is necessary when pluralizing all abbreviations, preferring &quot;PC&#x27;s, TV&#x27;s and VCR&#x27;s&quot;.

Forming a plural of an initialization without an apostrophe can also be used for a number, or a letter. Examples:
* Runs batted in, RBIs
* The roaring 20s
* Mind your Ps and Qs

For units of measure, the same form is used for both singular and plural. Examples:

* 1 lb or 20 lb
* 1 ft or 16 ft
* 1 min or 45 min

When an abbreviation contains more than one period, &quot;Hart&#x27;s Rules&quot; recommends putting the &quot;s&quot; after the final one. Examples:

* Ph.D.s
* M.Phil.s
* The d.t.s

However, the same plurals may be rendered less formally as:

* PhDs
* MPhils
* The DTs (This is the recommended form in the &quot;New Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors&quot;.)

According to &quot;Hart&#x27;s Rules&quot;, an apostrophe may be used in rare cases where clarity calls for it, for example when letters or symbols are referred to as objects.
* The x&#x27;s of the equation
* Dot the i&#x27;s and cross the t&#x27;s
However, the apostrophe can be dispensed with if the items are set in italics or quotes:
* The &quot;x&quot;s of the equation
* Dot the &#x27;i&#x27;s and cross the &#x27;t&#x27;s

In Latin, and continuing to the derivative forms in European languages as well as English, single-letter abbreviations had the plural being a doubling of the letter for note-taking. Most of these deal with writing and publishing. A few longer abbreviations use this as well.

=== Conventions followed by publications and newspapers ===

==== United States ====

Publications based in the U.S. tend to follow the style guides of &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot; and the Associated Press. The U.S. government follows a style guide published by the U.S. Government Printing Office. The National Institute of Standards and Technology sets the style for abbreviations of units.

==== United Kingdom ====

Many British publications follow some of these guidelines in abbreviation:
* For the sake of convenience, many British publications, including the BBC and &quot;The Guardian&quot;, have completely done away with the use of periods in all abbreviations. These include:
** Social titles, e.g. Ms or Mr (though these would usually have not had periods—see above) Capt, Prof, &quot;etc.;&quot;
** Two-letter abbreviations for countries (&quot;US&quot;, not &quot;U.S.&quot;);
** Abbreviations beyond three letters (full caps for all except initialisms);
** Words seldom abbreviated with lower case letters (&quot;PR&quot;, instead of &quot;p.r.&quot;, or &quot;pr&quot;)
** Names (&quot;FW de Klerk&quot;, &quot;GB Whiteley&quot;, &quot;Park JS&quot;). A notable exception is &quot;The Economist&quot; which writes &quot;Mr F. W. de Klerk&quot;.
** Scientific units (see Measurements below).
* Acronyms are often referred to with only the first letter of the abbreviation capitalized. For instance, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization can be abbreviated as &quot;Nato&quot; or &quot;NATO&quot;, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome as &quot;Sars&quot; or &quot;SARS&quot; (compare with &quot;laser&quot; which has made the full transition to an English word and is rarely capitalised at all).
* Initialisms are always written in capitals; for example the &quot;British Broadcasting Corporation&quot; is abbreviated to &quot;BBC&quot;, never &quot;Bbc&quot;. An initialism is also an acronym but is not pronounced as a word.
* When abbreviating scientific units, no space is added between the number and unit (100mph, 100m, 10cm, 10°C). (This is contrary to the SI standard; see below.)

==== Miscellaneous and general rules ====

* A doubled letter appears in abbreviations of some Welsh names, as in Welsh the double &quot;l&quot; is a separate sound: &quot;Ll. George&quot; for (British prime minister) David Lloyd George.
* Some titles, such as &quot;Reverend&quot; and &quot;Honourable&quot;, are spelt out when preceded by &quot;the&quot;, rather than as &quot;Rev.&quot; or &quot;Hon.&quot; respectively. This is true for most British publications, and some in the United States.
* A repeatedly used abbreviation should be spelt out for identification on its first occurrence in a written or spoken passage. Abbreviations likely to be unfamiliar to many readers should be avoided.

== Measurements: abbreviations or symbols==
Writers often use shorthand to denote units of measure. Such shorthand can be an abbreviation, such as &quot;in&quot; for &quot;inch&quot; or can be a symbol such as &quot;km&quot; for &quot;kilometre&quot;.

In the International System of Units (SI) manual the word &quot;symbol&quot; is used consistently to define the shorthand used to represent the various SI units of measure. The manual also defines the way in which units should be written, the principal rules being:
*The conventions for upper and lower case letters must be observed—for example 1 MW (megawatts) is equal to 1,000,000 watts and 1,000,000,000 mW (milliwatts).
*No periods should be inserted between letters—for example &quot;m.s&quot; (which is an approximation of &quot;m·s&quot;, which correctly uses middle dot) is the symbol for &quot;metres multiplied by seconds&quot;, but &quot;ms&quot; is the symbol for milliseconds.
*No periods should follow the symbol unless the syntax of the sentence demands otherwise (for example a full stop at the end of a sentence).
*The singular and plural versions of the symbol are identical—not all languages use the letter &quot;s&quot; to denote a plural.

== Syllabic abbreviation ==

A syllabic abbreviation is usually formed from the initial syllables of several words, such as &quot;Interpol&quot; = &quot;International&quot; + &quot;police&quot;. It is a variant of the acronym. Syllabic abbreviations are usually written using lower case, sometimes starting with a capital letter, and are always pronounced as words rather than letter by letter. Syllabic abbreviations should be distinguished from portmanteaus, which combine two words without necessarily taking whole syllables from each.

=== English ===
Syllabic abbreviations are not widely used in English. Some UK government agencies such as Ofcom (Office of Communications) and the former Oftel (Office of Telecommunications) use this style.

New York City has various neighborhoods named by syllabic abbreviation, such as Tribeca (Triangle below Canal Street) and SoHo (South of Houston Street). This usage has spread into other American cities, giving SoMa, San Francisco (South of Market) and LoDo, Denver (Lower Downtown), amongst others.

Chicago-based electric service provider ComEd is a syllabic abbreviation of &quot;Commonwealth&quot; and (Thomas) &quot;Edison&quot;.

Sections of California are also often colloquially syllabically abbreviated, as in NorCal (Northern California), CenCal (Central California), and SoCal (Southern California). Additionally, in the context of Los Angeles, the syllabic abbreviation SoHo (Southern Hollywood) refers to the southern portion of the Hollywood neighborhood.

Partially syllabic abbreviations are preferred by the US Navy, as they increase readability amidst the large number of initialisms that would otherwise have to fit into the same acronyms. Hence &quot;DESRON 6&quot; is used (in the full capital form) to mean &quot;Destroyer Squadron 6&quot;, while &quot;COMNAVAIRLANT&quot; would be &quot;Commander, Naval Air Force (in the) Atlantic&quot;.

Syllabic abbreviations are a prominent feature of Newspeak, the fictional language of George Orwell&#x27;s dystopian novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. The political contractions of Newspeak—&quot;Ingsoc&quot; (English Socialism), &quot;Minitrue&quot; (Ministry of Truth), &quot;Miniplenty&quot; (Ministry of Plenty)—are described by Orwell as similar to real examples of German &quot;(see below)&quot; and Russian (&quot;see below)&quot; contractions in the 20th century. The contractions in Newspeak are supposed to have a political function by virtue of their abbreviated structure itself: nice sounding and easily pronounceable, their purpose is to mask all ideological content from the speaker.

A more recent syllabic abbreviation has emerged with the disease COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019) caused by the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (itself frequently abbreviated to SARS-CoV-2, partly an initialism).

=== Albanian ===

In Albanian, syllabic acronyms are sometimes used for composing a person&#x27;s name, such as &quot;Migjeni&quot;—an abbreviation from his original name (&quot;Millosh Gjergj Nikolla&quot;) a famous Albanian poet and writer—or &quot;ASDRENI&quot; (&quot;Aleksander Stavre Drenova&quot;), another famous Albanian poet.

Other such names which are used commonly in recent decades are GETOAR, composed from &quot;Gegeria&quot; + &quot;Tosks&quot; (representing the two main dialects of the Albanian language, Gegë and Toskë), and &quot;Arbanon&quot;—which is an alternative way used to describe all Albanian lands.

=== German ===
Syllabic abbreviations were and are common in German; much like acronyms in English, they have a distinctly modern connotation, although contrary to popular belief, many date back to before 1933, if not the end of the Great War. , literally &quot;criminal police&quot; but idiomatically the Criminal Investigation Department of any German police force, begat (variously capitalised), and likewise (&quot;protection police&quot; or &quot;uniform department&quot;) begat . Along the same lines, the Swiss Federal Railways&#x27; Transit Police—the —are abbreviated as the .

With the National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party gaining power came a frenzy of government reorganisation, and with it a series of entirely new syllabic abbreviations. The single national police force amalgamated from the of the various states became the OrPo (, &quot;order police&quot;); the state KriPos together formed the &quot;SiPo&quot; (, &quot;security police&quot;); and there was also the Gestapo (, &quot;secret state police&quot;). The new order of the German Democratic Republic in the east brought about a conscious denazification, but also a repudiation of earlier turns of phrase in favour of neologisms such as for (&quot;state security&quot;, the secret police) and for . The phrase , which may be rendered literally as &quot;office of politics&quot; or idiomatically as &quot;political party steering committee&quot;, became .

Syllabic abbreviations are not only used in politics, however. Many business names, trademarks, and service marks from across Germany are created on the same pattern: for a few examples, there is Aldi, from &quot;Theo Albrecht&quot;, the name of its founder, followed by &quot;discount&quot;; Haribo, from &quot;Hans Riegel&quot;, the name of its founder, followed by &quot;Bonn&quot;, the town of its head office; and Adidas, from &quot;Adolf &quot;Adi&quot; Dassler&quot;, the nickname of its founder followed by his surname.

=== Russian ===
Syllabic abbreviations are very common in Russian, Belarusian and Ukrainian languages. They are often used as names of organizations. Historically, popularization of abbreviations was a way to simplify mass-education in 1920s (see Likbez). The word &quot;kolkhoz&quot; (&quot;kollektívnoye khozyáystvo&quot;, collective farm) is another example.

Leninist organisations such as the &quot;Comintern&quot; (&quot;Communist International&quot;) and &quot;Komsomol&quot; (&quot;Kommunisticheskii Soyuz Molodyozhi&quot;, or &quot;Communist youth union&quot;) used Russian language syllabic abbreviations. In the modern Russian language, words like &quot;Rosselkhozbank&quot; (from Rossiysky selskokhozyaystvenny bank — Russian Agricultural Bank, RusAg) and &quot;Minobrnauki&quot; (from Ministerstvo obrazovaniya i nauki — Ministry of Education and Science) are still commonly used. In nearby Belarus, there are &quot;Beltelecom&quot; (Belarus Telecommunication) and Belsat (Belarus Satellite).

=== Spanish ===
Syllabic abbreviations are common in Spanish; examples abound in organization names such as Pemex for &quot;Petróleos Mexicanos&quot; (&quot;Mexican Petroleums&quot;) or Fonafifo for &quot;Fondo Nacional de Financimiento Forestal&quot; (National Forestry Financing Fund).

=== Malay and Indonesian ===
In Southeast Asian languages, especially in Malay languages, abbreviations are common; examples include Petronas (for &quot;Petroliam Nasional&quot;, &quot;National Petroleum&quot;), its Indonesian equivalent Pertamina (from its original name &quot;Perusahaan Pertambangan Minyak dan Gas Bumi Negara&quot;, &quot;State Oil and Natural Gas Mining Company&quot;), and Kemenhub (from &quot;Kementerian Perhubungan&quot;, &quot;Ministry of Transportation&quot;).

Malaysian abbreviation often uses letters from each word, while Indonesia usually uses syllables; although some cases do not follow the style. For example, general elections in Malaysian Malay often shortened into PRU (pilihan raya umum) while Indonesian often shortened into pemilu (pemilihan umum). Another example is Ministry of Health in which Malaysian Malay uses KKM (Kementerian Kesihatan Malaysia), compared to Indonesian Kemenkes (Kementerian Kesehatan).

=== Chinese and Japanese kanji ===
East Asian languages whose writing systems use Chinese characters form abbreviations similarly by using key Chinese characters from a term or phrase. For example, in Japanese the term for the United Nations, &quot;kokusai rengō&quot; (国際連合) is often abbreviated to &quot;kokuren&quot; (国連). (Such abbreviations are called ryakugo (略語) in Japanese; see also Japanese abbreviated and contracted words). The syllabic abbreviation of kanji words is frequently used for universities: for instance, &quot;Tōdai&quot; (東大) for &quot;Tōkyō daigaku&quot; (東京大学, University of Tokyo) and is used similarly in Chinese: &quot;Běidà&quot; (北大) for &quot;Běijīng Dàxué&quot; (北京大学, Peking University). Korean universities often follow the same conventions, such as &quot;Hongdae&quot; (홍대) as short for &quot;Hongik Daehakgyo&quot;, or Hongik University. The English phrase &quot;Gung ho&quot; originated as a Chinese abbreviation.

<doc id="1174" wikidata="Q35500" url="?curid=1174" title="Aphrodite">
<text>Aphrodite (, ) is an ancient Greek goddess associated with love, lust, beauty, pleasure, passion, procreation, and as her syncretized Roman counterpart , desire, sex, fertility, prosperity, and victory. Aphrodite&#x27;s major symbols include seashells, myrtles, roses, doves, sparrows, and swans. The cult of Aphrodite was largely derived from that of the Phoenician goddess Astarte, a cognate of the East Semitic goddess Ishtar, whose cult was based on the Sumerian cult of Inanna. Aphrodite&#x27;s main cult centers were Cythera, Cyprus, Corinth, and Athens. Her main festival was the Aphrodisia, which was celebrated annually in midsummer. In Laconia, Aphrodite was worshipped as a warrior goddess. She was also the patron goddess of prostitutes, an association which led early scholars to propose the concept of sacred prostitution in Greco-Roman culture, an idea which is now generally seen as erroneous.

A major goddess in the Greek pantheon, Aphrodite featured prominently in ancient Greek literature. In Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, Aphrodite is born off the coast of Cythera from the foam (, ) produced by Uranus&#x27;s genitals, which his son Cronus had severed and thrown into the sea. In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, however, she is the daughter of Zeus and Dione. In his &quot;Symposium&quot;, Plato asserts that these two origins actually belong to separate entities; Aphrodite Urania (a transcendent &quot;Heavenly&quot; Aphrodite) and Aphrodite Pandemos (Aphrodite common to &quot;all the people&quot;). The epithet Aphrodite Areia (the &quot;Warlike&quot;) reveals her contrasting nature in ancient Greek religion. Aphrodite had many other epithets, each emphasizing a different aspect of the same goddess or used by a different local cult. Thus she was also known as Cytherea (&quot;Lady of Cythera&quot;) and Cypris (&quot;Lady of Cyprus&quot;), because both locations claimed to be the place of her birth. Sappho&#x27;s &quot;Ode to Aphrodite&quot; is one of the earliest poems dedicated to the goddess and survives from the Archaic period nearly complete.

In Greek mythology, Aphrodite was married to Hephaestus, the god of fire, blacksmiths and metalworking. Aphrodite was frequently unfaithful to him and had many lovers; in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, she is caught in the act of adultery with Ares, the god of war. In the &quot;First Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite&quot;, she seduces the mortal shepherd Anchises. Aphrodite was also the surrogate mother and lover of the mortal shepherd Adonis, who was killed by a wild boar. Along with Athena and Hera, Aphrodite was one of the three goddesses whose feud resulted in the beginning of the Trojan War and plays a major role throughout the &quot;Iliad&quot;. Aphrodite has been featured in Western art as a symbol of female beauty and has appeared in numerous works of Western literature. She is a major deity in modern Neopagan religions, including the Church of Aphrodite, Wicca, and Hellenism.

== Etymology ==
Hesiod derives the name &quot;Aphrodite&quot; from () &quot;sea-foam&quot;, interpreting the name as &quot;risen from the foam&quot;, but most modern scholars regard this as a spurious folk etymology. Early-modern scholars of classical mythology attempted to argue that Aphrodite&#x27;s name was of Greek or Indo-European origin, but these efforts have mostly been abandoned. Aphrodite&#x27;s name is generally accepted to be of non-Greek (probably Semitic) origin, but its exact derivation cannot be determined with confidence.

Scholars in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, accepting Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;foam&quot; etymology as genuine, analyzed the second part of Aphrodite&#x27;s name as *&quot;-odítē&quot; &quot;wanderer&quot; or as *&quot;-dítē&quot; &quot;bright&quot;. More recently, Michael Janda, also accepting Hesiod&#x27;s etymology, has argued in favor of the latter of these interpretations and claims the story of a birth from the foam as an Indo-European mytheme. Similarly, Krzysztof Tomasz Witczak proposes an Indo-European compound &quot;very&quot; and &quot;to shine&quot;, also referring to Eos, and Daniel Kölligan has interpreted Aphrodite&#x27;s name as &quot;shining up from the mist/foam&quot;. Other scholars have argued that these hypotheses are unlikely, since Aphrodite&#x27;s attributes are entirely different from those of both Eos and the Vedic deity Ushas.

Modern scholars, due to the believed Near Eastern origins of Aphrodite&#x27;s worship, have since proposed Semitic origins for the name. Some scholars, such as Fritz Hommel, have suggested that Aphrodite&#x27;s name is a hellenized pronunciation of the name &quot;Astarte&quot;; other scholars, however, reject this as being linguistically untenable. Martin West reconstructs a Cyprian Canaanite form of the name as either or , and cautiously suggests the latter as being an epithet with the meaning &quot;She of the Villages&quot;. Aren Wilson-Wright suggests the Phoenician form as an elative epithet meaning &quot;unique, excellent, sublime&quot;.

A number of improbable non-Greek etymologies have also been suggested. One Semitic etymology compares Aphrodite to the Assyrian &quot;barīrītu&quot;, the name of a female demon that appears in Middle Babylonian and Late Babylonian texts. Hammarström looks to Etruscan, comparing &quot;(e)prθni&quot; &quot;lord&quot;, an Etruscan honorific loaned into Greek as πρύτανις. This would make the theonym in origin an honorific, &quot;the lady&quot;. Most scholars reject this etymology as implausible, especially since Aphrodite&#x27;s name actually appears in Etruscan in the borrowed form &quot;Apru&quot; (from Greek , clipped form of &quot;Aphrodite&quot;). The medieval &quot;Etymologicum Magnum&quot; () offers a highly contrived etymology, deriving &quot;Aphrodite&quot; from the compound &quot;habrodíaitos&quot; (), &quot;she who lives delicately&quot;, from &quot;habrós&quot; and &quot;díaita&quot;. The alteration from &quot;b&quot; to &quot;ph&quot; is explained as a &quot;familiar&quot; characteristic of Greek &quot;obvious from the Macedonians&quot;.

In the Cypriot syllabary, a syllabic script used on the island of Cyprus from the eleventh until the fourth centuries BC, Aphrodite&#x27;s name is attested in the forms (a-po-ro-ta-o-i, read right-to-left), (a-po-ro-ti-ta-i, samewise), and finally (a-po-ro-ti-si-jo, &quot;&quot;, &quot;related to Aphrodite&quot;, in the context of a month).

==Origins==
===Near Eastern love goddess===
The cult of Aphrodite in Greece was imported from, or at least influenced by, the cult of Astarte in Phoenicia, which, in turn, was influenced by the cult of the Mesopotamian goddess known as &quot;Ishtar&quot; to the East Semitic peoples and as &quot;Inanna&quot; to the Sumerians. Pausanias states that the first to establish a cult of Aphrodite were the Assyrians, followed by the Paphians of Cyprus and then the Phoenicians at Ascalon. The Phoenicians, in turn, taught her worship to the people of Cythera.

Aphrodite took on Inanna-Ishtar&#x27;s associations with sexuality and procreation. Furthermore, she was known as Ourania (Οὐρανία), which means &quot;heavenly&quot;, a title corresponding to Inanna&#x27;s role as the Queen of Heaven. Early artistic and literary portrayals of Aphrodite are extremely similar on Inanna-Ishtar. Like Inanna-Ishtar, Aphrodite was also a warrior goddess; the second-century AD Greek geographer Pausanias records that, in Sparta, Aphrodite was worshipped as &quot;Aphrodite Areia&quot;, which means &quot;warlike&quot;. He also mentions that Aphrodite&#x27;s most ancient cult statues in Sparta and on Cythera showed her bearing arms. Modern scholars note that Aphrodite&#x27;s warrior-goddess aspects appear in the oldest strata of her worship and see it as an indication of her Near Eastern origins.

Nineteenth-century classical scholars had a general aversion to the idea that ancient Greek religion was at all influenced by the cultures of the Near East, but, even Friedrich Gottlieb Welcker, who argued that Near Eastern influence on Greek culture was largely confined to material culture, admitted that Aphrodite was clearly of Phoenician origin. The significant influence of Near Eastern culture on early Greek religion in general, and on the cult of Aphrodite in particular, is now widely recognized as dating to a period of orientalization during the eighth century BC, when archaic Greece was on the fringes of the Neo-Assyrian Empire.

===Indo-European dawn goddess===
Some early comparative mythologists opposed to the idea of a Near Eastern origin argued that Aphrodite originated as an aspect of the Greek dawn goddess Eos and that she was therefore ultimately derived from the Proto-Indo-European dawn goddess *&quot;Haéusōs&quot; (properly Greek Eos, Latin Aurora, Sanskrit Ushas). Most modern scholars have now rejected the notion of a purely Indo-European Aphrodite, but it is possible that Aphrodite, originally a Semitic deity, may have been influenced by the Indo-European dawn goddess. Both Aphrodite and Eos were known for their erotic beauty and aggressive sexuality and both had relationships with mortal lovers. Both goddesses were associated with the colors red, white, and gold. Michael Janda etymologizes Aphrodite&#x27;s name as an epithet of Eos meaning &quot;she who rises from the foam [of the ocean]&quot; and points to Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot; account of Aphrodite&#x27;s birth as an archaic reflex of Indo-European myth. Aphrodite rising out of the waters after Cronus defeats Uranus as a mytheme would then be directly cognate to the Rigvedic myth of Indra defeating Vrtra, liberating Ushas. Another key similarity between Aphrodite and the Indo-European dawn goddess is her close kinship to the Greek sky deity, since both of the main claimants to her paternity (Zeus and Uranus) are sky deities.

==Forms and epithets==


Aphrodite&#x27;s most common cultic epithet was &quot;Ourania&quot;, meaning &quot;heavenly&quot;, but this epithet almost never occurs in literary texts, indicating a purely cultic significance. Another common name for Aphrodite was &quot;Pandemos&quot; (&quot;For All the Folk&quot;). In her role as Aphrodite Pandemos, Aphrodite was associated with &quot;Peithō&quot; (), meaning &quot;persuasion&quot;, and could be prayed to for aid in seduction. The character of Pausanias in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot;, takes differing cult-practices associated with different epithets of the goddess to claim that Ourania and Pandemos are, in fact, separate goddesses. He asserts that &quot;Aphrodite Ourania&quot; is the celestial Aphrodite, born from the sea foam after Cronus castrated Uranus, and the older of the two goddesses. According to the &quot;Symposium&quot;, &quot;Aphrodite Ourania&quot; is the inspiration of male homosexual desire, specifically the ephebic eros, and pederasty. &quot;Aphrodite Pandemos&quot;, by contrast, is the younger of the two goddesses: the common Aphrodite, born from the union of Zeus and Dione, and the inspiration of heterosexual desire and sexual promiscuity, the &quot;lesser&quot; of the two loves. &quot;Paphian&quot; (Παφία), was one of her epithets, after the Paphos in Cyprus where she had emerged from the sea at her birth.

Among the Neoplatonists and, later, their Christian interpreters, Ourania is associated with spiritual love, and Pandemos with physical love (desire). A representation of Ourania with her foot resting on a tortoise came to be seen as emblematic of discretion in conjugal love; it was the subject of a chryselephantine sculpture by Phidias for Elis, known only from a parenthetical comment by the geographer Pausanias.

One of Aphrodite&#x27;s most common literary epithets is &quot;Philommeidḗs&quot; (), which means &quot;smile-loving&quot;, but is sometimes mistranslated as &quot;laughter-loving&quot;. This epithet occurs throughout both of the Homeric epics and the &quot;First Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite&quot;. Hesiod references it once in his &quot;Theogony&quot; in the context of Aphrodite&#x27;s birth, but interprets it as &quot;genital-loving&quot; rather than &quot;smile-loving&quot;. Monica Cyrino notes that the epithet may relate to the fact that, in many artistic depictions of Aphrodite, she is shown smiling. Other epithets of her include &quot;Mechanitis&quot; meaning skilled in inventing and &quot;Automata&quot; because, according to Servius, she was the source of spontaneous love.

Common literary epithets of Aphrodite are &quot;Cypris&quot; and &quot;Cythereia&quot;, which derive from her associations with the islands of Cyprus and Cythera respectively. On Cyprus, Aphrodite was sometimes called &quot;Eleemon&quot; (&quot;the merciful&quot;). In Athens, she was known as &quot;Aphrodite en kēpois&quot; (&quot;Aphrodite of the Gardens&quot;). At Cape Colias, a town along the Attic coast, she was venerated as &quot;Genetyllis&quot; &quot;Mother&quot;. The Spartans worshipped her as &quot;Potnia&quot; &quot;Mistress&quot;, &quot;Enoplios&quot; &quot;Armed&quot;, &quot;Morpho&quot; &quot;Shapely&quot;, &quot;Ambologera&quot; &quot;She who Postpones Old Age&quot;. Across the Greek world, she was known under epithets such as &quot;Melainis&quot; in Corinth &quot;Black or Dark One&quot;, &quot;Skotia&quot; &quot;Dark One&quot;, &quot;Androphonos&quot; &quot;Killer of Men&quot;, &quot;Anosia&quot; &quot;Unholy&quot;, and &quot;Tymborychos&quot; &quot;Gravedigger&quot;, all of which indicate her darker, more violent nature.

A male version of Aphrodite known as Aphroditus was worshipped in the city of Amathus on Cyprus. Aphroditus was depicted with the figure and dress of a woman, but had a beard, and was shown lifting his dress to reveal an erect phallus. This gesture was believed to be an apotropaic symbol, and was thought to convey good fortune upon the viewer. Eventually, the popularity of Aphroditus waned as the mainstream, fully feminine version of Aphrodite became more popular, but traces of his cult are preserved in the later legends of Hermaphroditus.

==Worship==
===Classical period===
Aphrodite&#x27;s main festival, the Aphrodisia, was celebrated across Greece, but particularly in Athens and Corinth. In Athens, the Aphrodisia was celebrated on the fourth day of the month of Hekatombaion in honor of Aphrodite&#x27;s role in the unification of Attica. During this festival, the priests of Aphrodite would purify the temple of Aphrodite Pandemos on the southwestern slope of the Acropolis with the blood of a sacrificed dove. Next, the altars would be anointed and the cult statues of Aphrodite Pandemos and Peitho would be escorted in a majestic procession to a place where they would be ritually bathed. Aphrodite was also honored in Athens as part of the Arrhephoria festival. The fourth day of every month was sacred to Aphrodite.

Pausanias records that, in Sparta, Aphrodite was worshipped as &quot;Aphrodite Areia&quot;, which means &quot;warlike&quot;. This epithet stresses Aphrodite&#x27;s connections to Ares, with whom she had extramarital relations. Pausanias also records that, in Sparta and on Cythera, a number of extremely ancient cult statues of Aphrodite portrayed her bearing arms. Other cult statues showed her bound in chains.

Aphrodite was the patron goddess of prostitutes of all varieties, ranging from &quot;pornai&quot; (cheap street prostitutes typically owned as slaves by wealthy pimps) to &quot;hetairai&quot; (expensive, well-educated hired companions, who were usually self-employed and sometimes provided sex to their customers). The city of Corinth was renowned throughout the ancient world for its many &quot;hetairai&quot;, who had a widespread reputation for being among the most skilled, but also the most expensive, prostitutes in the Greek world. Corinth also had a major temple to Aphrodite located on the Acrocorinth and was one of the main centers of her cult. Records of numerous dedications to Aphrodite made by successful courtesans have survived in poems and in pottery inscriptions. References to Aphrodite in association with prostitution are found in Corinth as well as on the islands of Cyprus, Cythera, and Sicily. Aphrodite&#x27;s Mesopotamian precursor Inanna-Ishtar was also closely associated with prostitution.

Scholars in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries believed that the cult of Aphrodite may have involved ritual prostitution, an assumption based on ambiguous passages in certain ancient texts, particularly a fragment of a &quot;skolion&quot; by the Boeotian poet Pindar, which mentions prostitutes in Corinth in association with Aphrodite. Modern scholars now dismiss the notion of ritual prostitution in Greece as a &quot;historiographic myth&quot; with no factual basis.

===Hellenistic and Roman periods===
During the Hellenistic period, the Greeks identified Aphrodite with the ancient Egyptian goddesses Hathor and Isis. Aphrodite was the patron goddess of the Lagid queens and Queen Arsinoe II was identified as her mortal incarnation. Aphrodite was worshipped in Alexandria and had numerous temples in and around the city. Arsinoe II introduced the cult of Adonis to Alexandria and many of the women there partook in it. The Tessarakonteres, a gigantic catamaran galley designed by Archimedes for Ptolemy IV Philopator, had a circular temple to Aphrodite on it with a marble statue of the goddess herself. In the second century BC, Ptolemy VIII Physcon and his wives Cleopatra II and Cleopatra III dedicated a temple to Aphrodite Hathor at Philae. Statuettes of Aphrodite for personal devotion became common in Egypt starting in the early Ptolemaic times and extending until long after Egypt became a Roman province.

The ancient Romans identified Aphrodite with their goddess Venus, who was originally a goddess of agricultural fertility, vegetation, and springtime. According to the Roman historian Livy, Aphrodite and Venus were officially identified in the third century BC when the cult of &quot;Venus Erycina&quot; was introduced to Rome from the Greek sanctuary of Aphrodite on Mount Eryx in Sicily. After this point, Romans adopted Aphrodite&#x27;s iconography and myths and applied them to Venus. Because Aphrodite was the mother of the Trojan hero Aeneas in Greek mythology and the Roman tradition claimed Aeneas as the founder of Rome, Venus became venerated as &quot;Venus Genetrix&quot;, the mother of the entire Roman nation. Julius Caesar claimed to be directly descended from Aeneas&#x27;s son Iulus and became a strong proponent of the cult of Venus. This precedent was later followed by his nephew Augustus and the later emperors claiming succession from him.

This syncretism greatly impacted Greek worship of Aphrodite. During the Roman era, the cults of Aphrodite in many Greek cities began to emphasize her relationship with Troy and Aeneas. They also began to adopt distinctively Roman elements, portraying Aphrodite as more maternal, more militaristic, and more concerned with administrative bureaucracy. She was claimed as a divine guardian by many political magistrates. Appearances of Aphrodite in Greek literature also vastly proliferated, usually showing Aphrodite in a characteristically Roman manner.

==Mythology==
=== Birth ===

Aphrodite is usually said to have been born near her chief center of worship, Paphos, on the island of Cyprus, which is why she is sometimes called &quot;Cyprian&quot;, especially in the poetic works of Sappho. The Sanctuary of Aphrodite Paphia, marking her birthplace, was a place of pilgrimage in the ancient world for centuries. Other versions of her myth have her born near the island of Cythera, hence another of her names, &quot;Cytherea&quot;. Cythera was a stopping place for trade and culture between Crete and the Peloponesus, so these stories may preserve traces of the migration of Aphrodite&#x27;s cult from the Middle East to mainland Greece.
According to the version of her birth recounted by Hesiod in his &quot;Theogony&quot;, Cronus severed Uranus&#x27; genitals and threw them behind him into the sea. The foam from his genitals gave rise to Aphrodite (hence her name, which Hesiod interprets as &quot;foam-arisen&quot;), while the Giants, the Erinyes (furies), and the Meliae emerged from the drops of his blood. Hesiod states that the genitals &quot;were carried over the sea a long time, and white foam arose from the immortal flesh; with it a girl grew.&quot; After Aphrodite was born from the sea-foam, she washed up to shore in the presence of the other gods. Hesiod&#x27;s account of Aphrodite&#x27;s birth following Uranus&#x27;s castration is probably derived from &quot;The Song of Kumarbi&quot;, an ancient Hittite epic poem in which the god Kumarbi overthrows his father Anu, the god of the sky, and bites off his genitals, causing him to become pregnant and give birth to Anu&#x27;s children, which include Ishtar and her brother Teshub, the Hittite storm god.

In the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Aphrodite is described as the daughter of Zeus and Dione. Dione&#x27;s name appears to be a feminine cognate to &quot;Dios&quot; and &quot;Dion&quot;, which are oblique forms of the name &quot;Zeus&quot;. Zeus and Dione shared a cult at Dodona in northwestern Greece. In the &quot;Theogony&quot;, Hesiod describes Dione as an Oceanid, but Apollodorus makes her the thirteenth Titan, child of Gaia and Uranus.

===Marriage===

Aphrodite is consistently portrayed as a nubile, infinitely desirable adult, having had no childhood. She is often depicted nude. In the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Aphrodite is the apparently unmarried consort of Ares, the god of war, and the wife of Hephaestus is a different goddess named Charis. Likewise, in Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, Aphrodite is unmarried and the wife of Hephaestus is Aglaea, the youngest of the three Charites.

In Book Eight of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, however, the blind singer Demodocus describes Aphrodite as the wife of Hephaestus and tells how she committed adultery with Ares during the Trojan War. The sun-god Helios saw Aphrodite and Ares having sex in Hephaestus&#x27;s bed and warned Hephaestus, who fashioned a fine, near invisible net. The next time Ares and Aphrodite had sex together, the net trapped them both. Hephaestus brought all the gods into the bedchamber to laugh at the captured adulterers, but Apollo, Hermes, and Poseidon had sympathy for Ares and Poseidon agreed to pay Hephaestus for Ares&#x27;s release. Aphrodite returned to her temple in Cyprus, where she was attended by the Charites. This narrative probably originated as a Greek folk tale, originally independent of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. In a much later interpolated detail, Ares put the young soldier Alectryon by the door to warn of Helios&#x27;s arrival but Alectryon fell asleep on guard duty. Helios discovered the two and alerted Hephaestus; Ares in rage turned Alectryon into a rooster, which unfailingly crows to announce the sunrise.

After exposing them, Hephaestus asks Zeus for his wedding gifts and dowry to be returned to him; by the time of the Trojan War, he is married to Charis/Aglaea, one of the Graces, apparently divorced from Aphrodite. Afterwards, it was generally Ares who was regarded as the husband or official consort of the goddess; on the François Vase, the two arrive at the wedding of Peleus and Thetis on the same chariot, as do Zeus with Hera and Poseidon with Amphitrite. The poets Pindar and Aeschylus refer to Ares as Aphrodite&#x27;s husband.

Later stories were invented to explain Aphrodite&#x27;s marriage to Hephaestus. In the most famous story, Zeus hastily married Aphrodite to Hephaestus in order to prevent the other gods from fighting over her. In another version of the myth, Hephaestus gave his mother Hera a golden throne, but when she sat on it, she became trapped and he refused to let her go until she agreed to give him Aphrodite&#x27;s hand in marriage. Hephaestus was overjoyed to be married to the goddess of beauty, and forged her beautiful jewelry, including a &quot;strophion&quot; () known as the (), a saltire-shaped undergarment (usually translated as the girdle of Aphrodite), which accentuated her breasts and made her even more irresistible to men. Such &quot;strophia&quot; were commonly used in depictions of the Near Eastern goddesses Ishtar and Atargatis.

===Attendants===

Aphrodite is almost always accompanied by Eros, the god of lust and sexual desire. In his &quot;Theogony&quot;, Hesiod describes Eros as one of the four original primeval forces born at the beginning of time, but, after the birth of Aphrodite from the sea foam, he is joined by Himeros and, together, they become Aphrodite&#x27;s constant companions. In early Greek art, Eros and Himeros are both shown as idealized handsome youths with wings. The Greek lyric poets regarded the power of Eros and Himeros as dangerous, compulsive, and impossible for anyone to resist. In modern times, Eros is often seen as Aphrodite&#x27;s son, but this is actually a comparatively late innovation. A &quot;scholion&quot; on Theocritus&#x27;s &quot;Idylls&quot; remarks that the sixth-century BC poet Sappho had described Eros as the son of Aphrodite and Uranus, but the first surviving reference to Eros as Aphrodite&#x27;s son comes from Apollonius of Rhodes&#x27;s &quot;Argonautica&quot;, written in the third century BC, which makes him the son of Aphrodite and Ares. Later, the Romans, who saw Venus as a mother goddess, seized on this idea of Eros as Aphrodite&#x27;s son and popularized it, making it the predominant portrayal in works on mythology until the present day.

Aphrodite&#x27;s main attendants were the three Charites, whom Hesiod identifies as the daughters of Zeus and Eurynome and names as Aglaea (&quot;Splendor&quot;), Euphrosyne (&quot;Good Cheer&quot;), and Thalia (&quot;Abundance&quot;). The Charites had been worshipped as goddesses in Greece since the beginning of Greek history, long before Aphrodite was introduced to the pantheon. Aphrodite&#x27;s other set of attendants was the three Horae (the &quot;Hours&quot;), whom Hesiod identifies as the daughters of Zeus and Themis and names as Eunomia (&quot;Good Order&quot;), Dike (&quot;Justice&quot;), and Eirene (&quot;Peace&quot;). Aphrodite was also sometimes accompanied by Harmonia, her daughter by Ares, and Hebe, the daughter of Zeus and Hera.

The fertility god Priapus was usually considered to be Aphrodite&#x27;s son by Dionysus, but he was sometimes also described as her son by Hermes, Adonis, or even Zeus. A &quot;scholion&quot; on Apollonius of Rhodes&#x27;s &quot;Argonautica&quot; states that, while Aphrodite was pregnant with Priapus, Hera envied her and applied an evil potion to her belly while she was sleeping to ensure that the child would be hideous. In another version, Hera cursed Aphrodite&#x27;s unborn son because he had been fathered by Zeus. When Aphrodite gave birth, she was horrified to see that the child had a massive, permanently erect penis, a potbelly, and a huge tongue. Aphrodite abandoned the infant to die in the wilderness, but a herdsman found him and raised him, later discovering that Priapus could use his massive penis to aid in the growth of plants.

===Anchises===
The &quot;First Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite&quot; (Hymn 5), which was probably composed sometime in the mid-seventh century BC, describes how Zeus once became annoyed with Aphrodite for causing deities to fall in love with mortals, so he caused her to fall in love with Anchises, a handsome mortal shepherd who lived in the foothills beneath Mount Ida near the city of Troy. Aphrodite appears to Anchises in the form of a tall, beautiful, mortal virgin while he is alone in his home. Anchises sees her dressed in bright clothing and gleaming jewelry, with her breasts shining with divine radiance. He asks her if she is Aphrodite and promises to build her an altar on top of the mountain if she will bless him and his family.

Aphrodite lies and tells him that she is not a goddess, but the daughter of one of the noble families of Phrygia. She claims to be able to understand the Trojan language because she had a Trojan nurse as a child and says that she found herself on the mountainside after she was snatched up by Hermes while dancing in a celebration in honor of Artemis, the goddess of virginity. Aphrodite tells Anchises that she is still a virgin and begs him to take her to his parents. Anchises immediately becomes overcome with mad lust for Aphrodite and swears that he will have sex with her. Anchises takes Aphrodite, with her eyes cast downwards, to his bed, which is covered in the furs of lions and bears. He then strips her naked and makes love to her.

After the lovemaking is complete, Aphrodite reveals her true divine form. Anchises is terrified, but Aphrodite consoles him and promises that she will bear him a son. She prophesies that their son will be the demigod Aeneas, who will be raised by the nymphs of the wilderness for five years before going to Troy to become a nobleman like his father. The story of Aeneas&#x27;s conception is also mentioned in Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot; and in Book II of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;.

===Adonis===
The myth of Aphrodite and Adonis is probably derived from the ancient Sumerian legend of Inanna and Dumuzid. The Greek name (&quot;Adōnis&quot;, ) is derived from the Canaanite word &quot;ʼadōn&quot;, meaning &quot;lord&quot;. The earliest known Greek reference to Adonis comes from a fragment of a poem by the Lesbian poet Sappho ( – ), in which a chorus of young girls asks Aphrodite what they can do to mourn Adonis&#x27;s death. Aphrodite replies that they must beat their breasts and tear their tunics. Later references flesh out the story with more details. According to the retelling of the story found in the poem &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; by the Roman poet Ovid (43 BC – 17/18 AD), Adonis was the son of Myrrha, who was cursed by Aphrodite with insatiable lust for her own father, King Cinyras of Cyprus, after Myrrha&#x27;s mother bragged that her daughter was more beautiful than the goddess. Driven out after becoming pregnant, Myrrha was changed into a myrrh tree, but still gave birth to Adonis.

Aphrodite found the baby and took him to the underworld to be fostered by Persephone. She returned for him once he was grown and discovered him to be strikingly handsome. Persephone wanted to keep Adonis, resulting in a custody battle between the two goddesses over whom should rightly possess Adonis. Zeus settled the dispute by decreeing that Adonis would spend one third of the year with Aphrodite, one third with Persephone, and one third with whomever he chose. Adonis chose to spend that time with Aphrodite. Then, one day, while Adonis was hunting, he was wounded by a wild boar and bled to death in Aphrodite&#x27;s arms. In a semi-mocking work, the &quot;Dialogues of the Gods&quot;, the satirical author Lucian comedically relates how a frustrated Aphrodite complains to the moon goddess Selene about her son Eros making Persephone fall in love with Adonis and now she has to share him with her.

In different versions of the story, the boar was either sent by Ares, who was jealous that Aphrodite was spending so much time with Adonis, or by Artemis, who wanted revenge against Aphrodite for having killed her devoted follower Hippolytus. In another version, Apollo in fury changed himself into a boar and killed Adonis because Aphrodite had blinded his son Erymanthus when he stumbled upon Aphrodite naked as she was bathing after intercourse with Adonis. The story also provides an etiology for Aphrodite&#x27;s associations with certain flowers. Reportedly, as she mourned Adonis&#x27;s death, she caused anemones to grow wherever his blood fell and declared a festival on the anniversary of his death. In one version of the story, Aphrodite injured herself on a thorn from a rose bush and the rose, which had previously been white, was stained red by her blood. According to Lucian&#x27;s &quot;On the Syrian Goddess&quot;, each year during the festival of Adonis, the Adonis River in Lebanon (now known as the Abraham River) ran red with blood.

The myth of Adonis is associated with the festival of the Adonia, which was celebrated by Greek women every year in midsummer. The festival, which was evidently already celebrated in Lesbos by Sappho&#x27;s time, seems to have first become popular in Athens in the mid-fifth century BC. At the start of the festival, the women would plant a &quot;garden of Adonis&quot;, a small garden planted inside a small basket or a shallow piece of broken pottery containing a variety of quick-growing plants, such as lettuce and fennel, or even quick-sprouting grains such as wheat and barley. The women would then climb ladders to the roofs of their houses, where they would place the gardens out under the heat of the summer sun. The plants would sprout in the sunlight but wither quickly in the heat. Then the women would mourn and lament loudly over the death of Adonis, tearing their clothes and beating their breasts in a public display of grief.

===Divine favoritism===

In Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Works and Days&quot;, Zeus orders Aphrodite to make Pandora, the first woman, physically beautiful and sexually attractive, so that she may become &quot;an evil men will love to embrace&quot;. Aphrodite &quot;spills grace&quot; over Pandora&#x27;s head and equips her with &quot;painful desire and knee-weakening anguish&quot;, thus making her the perfect vessel for evil to enter the world. Aphrodite&#x27;s attendants, Peitho, the Charites, and the Horae, adorn Pandora with gold and jewelry.

According to one myth, Aphrodite aided Hippomenes, a noble youth who wished to marry Atalanta, a maiden who was renowned throughout the land for her beauty, but who refused to marry any man unless he could outrun her in a footrace. Atalanta was an exceedingly swift runner and she beheaded all of the men who lost to her. Aphrodite gave Hippomenes three golden apples from the Garden of the Hesperides and instructed him to toss them in front of Atalanta as he raced her. Hippomenes obeyed Aphrodite&#x27;s order and Atalanta, seeing the beautiful, golden fruits, bent down to pick up each one, allowing Hippomenes to outrun her. In the version of the story from Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, Hippomenes forgets to repay Aphrodite for her aid, so she causes the couple to become inflamed with lust while they are staying at the temple of Cybele. The couple desecrate the temple by having sex in it, leading Cybele to turn them into lions as punishment.

The myth of Pygmalion is first mentioned by the third-century BC Greek writer Philostephanus of Cyrene, but is first recounted in detail in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. According to Ovid, Pygmalion was an exceedingly handsome sculptor from the island of Cyprus, who was so sickened by the immorality of women that he refused to marry. He fell madly and passionately in love with the ivory cult statue he was carving of Aphrodite and longed to marry it. Because Pygmalion was extremely pious and devoted to Aphrodite, the goddess brought the statue to life. Pygmalion married the girl the statue became and they had a son named Paphos, after whom the capital of Cyprus received its name. Pseudo-Apollodorus later mentions &quot;Metharme, daughter of Pygmalion, king of Cyprus&quot;.

===Anger myths===
Aphrodite generously rewarded those who honored her, but also punished those who disrespected her, often quite brutally. A myth described in Apollonius of Rhodes&#x27;s &quot;Argonautica&quot; and later summarized in the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; of Pseudo-Apollodorus tells how, when the women of the island of Lemnos refused to sacrifice to Aphrodite, the goddess cursed them to stink horribly so that their husbands would never have sex with them. Instead, their husbands started having sex with their Thracian slave-girls. In anger, the women of Lemnos murdered the entire male population of the island, as well as all the Thracian slaves. When Jason and his crew of Argonauts arrived on Lemnos, they mated with the sex-starved women under Aphrodite&#x27;s approval and repopulated the island. From then on, the women of Lemnos never disrespected Aphrodite again.

In Euripides&#x27;s tragedy &quot;Hippolytus&quot;, which was first performed at the City Dionysia in 428 BC, Theseus&#x27;s son Hippolytus worships only Artemis, the goddess of virginity, and refuses to engage in any form of sexual contact. Aphrodite is infuriated by his prideful behavior and, in the prologue to the play, she declares that, by honoring only Artemis and refusing to venerate her, Hippolytus has directly challenged her authority. Aphrodite therefore causes Hippolytus&#x27;s stepmother, Phaedra, to fall in love with him, knowing Hippolytus will reject her. After being rejected, Phaedra commits suicide and leaves a suicide note to Theseus telling him that she killed herself because Hippolytus attempted to rape her. Theseus prays to Poseidon to kill Hippolytus for his transgression. Poseidon sends a wild bull to scare Hippolytus&#x27;s horses as he is riding by the sea in his chariot, causing the horses to bolt and smash the chariot against the cliffs, dragging Hippolytus to a bloody death across the rocky shoreline. The play concludes with Artemis vowing to kill Aphrodite&#x27;s own mortal beloved (presumably Adonis) in revenge.

Glaucus of Corinth angered Aphrodite by refusing to let his horses for chariot racing mate, since doing so would hinder their speed. During the chariot race at the funeral games of King Pelias, Aphrodite drove his horses mad and they tore him apart.

Polyphonte was a young woman who chose a virginal life with Artemis instead of marriage and children, as favoured by Aphrodite. Aphrodite cursed her, causing her to have children by a bear. The resulting bear-like offspring Agrius and Oreius were wild cannibals who incurred the hatred of Zeus for attacking traveling strangers. Ultimately, Ares (who was Polyphonte&#x27;s grandfather) and Hermes (who was originally dispatched by Zeus to kill them) transformed all Polyphonte, Agrius, and Oreius into birds of ill omen while the servant who begged for mercy was transformed into a woodpecker.

According to Apollodorus, a jealous Aphrodite cursed Eos, the goddess of dawn, to be perpetually in love and have insatiable sexual desire because Eos once had lain with Aphrodite&#x27;s sweetheart Ares.
According to Ovid in his &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; (book 10.238 ff.), Propoetides who are the daughters of Propoetus from the city of Amathus on the island of Cyprus denied Aphrodite&#x27;s divinity and failed to worship her properly. Therefore, Aphrodite turned them into the world&#x27;s first prostitutes. According to Diodorus Siculus, when the Rhodian sea nymphe Halia&#x27;s six sons by Poseidon arrogantly refused to let Aphrodite land upon their shore, the goddess cursed them with insanity. In their madness, they raped Halia. As punishment, Poseidon buried them in the island&#x27;s sea-caverns.

Xanthius, a descendant of Bellerophon, had two children: Leucippus and an unnamed daughter. Through the wrath of Aphrodite (reasons unknown), Leucippus fell in love with his own sister. They started a secret relationship but the girl was already betrothed to another man and he went on to inform her father Xanthius, without telling him the name of the seducer. Xanthius went straight to his daughter&#x27;s chamber where she was together with Leucippus right at the moment. On hearing him enter, she tried to escape, but Xanthius hit her with a dagger, thinking that he was slaying the seducer, and killed her. Leucippus, failing to recognize his father at first, slew him. When the truth was revealed, he had to leave the country and took part in colonization of Crete and the lands in Asia Minor.

Queen Cenchreis of Cyprus, wife of King Cinyras, bragged that her daughter Myrrha was more beautiful than Aphrodite. Therefore, Myrrha was cursed by Aphrodite with insatiable lust for her own father, King Cinyras of Cyprus and he slept with her unknowingly in the dark. She eventually transformed into the myrrh tree and gave birth to Adonis in this form. Cinyras also had three other daughters: Braesia, Laogora, and Orsedice. These girls by the wrath of Aphrodite (reasons unknown) cohabited with foreigners and ended their life in Egypt.

The Muse Clio derided the goddess&#x27; own love for Adonis. Therefore, Clio fell in love with Pierus, son of Magnes and bore Hyacinth.

Aegiale was a daughter of Adrastus and Amphithea and was married to Diomedes. Because of anger of Aphrodite, whom Diomedes had wounded in the war against Troy, she had multiple lovers, including a certain Hippolytus. when Aegiale went so far as to threaten his life, he fled to Italy. According to Stesichorus and Hesiod while Tyndareus sacrificing to the gods he forgot Aphrodite, therefore the goddess made his daughters twice and thrice wed and deserters of their husbands. Timandra deserted Echemus and went and came to Phyleus and Clytaemnestra deserted Agamemnon and lay with Aegisthus who was a worse mate for her and eventually killed her husband with her lover and finally, Helen of Troy deserted Menelaus under the influence of Aphrodite for Paris and her unfaitfulness eventually causes the War of Troy. As a result of her actions, Aphrodite caused the War of Troy in order to take Priam&#x27;s kingdom and pass it down to her descendants.
In one of the versions of the legend, Pasiphae did not make offerings to the goddess Venus [Aphrodite]. Because of this, Venus [Aphrodite] inspired in her an unnatural love for a bull resulting in the birth of the Minotaur or she cursed her because she was Helios&#x27;s daughter who revealed her adultery to Hephaestus. For Helios&#x27; own tale-telling, she cursed him with uncontrollable lust over the mortal princess Leucothoe, which led to him abandoning his then-lover Clytie, leaving her heartbroken.

Lysippe was the mother of Tanais by Berossos. Her son only venerated Ares and was fully devoted to war, neglecting love and marriage. Aphrodite cursed him with falling in love with his own mother. Preferring to die rather than give up his chastity, he threw himself into the river Amazonius, which was subsequently renamed Tanais.

According to Hyginus, Orpheus&#x27;s mother Calliope of the Muses at the behest of Zeus, judged the dispute between the goddesses Aphrodite and Persephone over Adonis and decided that both shall possess him half of the year. This enraged Venus [Aphrodite], because she had not been granted what she thought was her right. Therefore, Venus [Aphrodite] inspired love for Orpheus in the women of Thrace, causing them to tear him apart as each of them sought Orpheus for herself.

Aphrodite personally witnessed the young huntress Rhodopis swear eternal devotion and chastity to Artemis when she joined her group. Aphrodite then summoned her son Eros, and convinced him that such lifestyle was an insult to them both. So under her command, Eros made Rhodopis and Euthynicus, another young hunter who had shunned love and romance just like her, to fall in love with each other. Despite their chaste life, Rhodopis and Euthynicus withdrew to some cavern where they violated their vows. Artemis was not slow to take notice after seeing Aphrodite laugh, so she changed Rhodopis into a fountain as a punishment instead.

===Judgment of Paris and Trojan War===

The myth of the Judgement of Paris is mentioned briefly in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, but is described in depth in an epitome of the &quot;Cypria&quot;, a lost poem of the Epic Cycle, which records that all the gods and goddesses as well as various mortals were invited to the marriage of Peleus and Thetis (the eventual parents of Achilles). Only Eris, goddess of discord, was not invited. She was annoyed at this, so she arrived with a golden apple inscribed with the word καλλίστῃ (kallistēi, &quot;for the fairest&quot;), which she threw among the goddesses. Aphrodite, Hera, and Athena all claimed to be the fairest, and thus the rightful owner of the apple.

The goddesses chose to place the matter before Zeus, who, not wanting to favor one of the goddesses, put the choice into the hands of Paris, a Trojan prince. After bathing in the spring of Mount Ida where Troy was situated, the goddesses appeared before Paris for his decision. In the extant ancient depictions of the Judgement of Paris, Aphrodite is only occasionally represented nude, and Athena and Hera are always fully clothed. Since the Renaissance, however, Western paintings have typically portrayed all three goddesses as completely naked.

All three goddesses were ideally beautiful and Paris could not decide between them, so they resorted to bribes. Hera tried to bribe Paris with power over all Asia and Europe, and Athena offered wisdom, fame and glory in battle, but Aphrodite promised Paris that, if he were to choose her as the fairest, she would let him marry the most beautiful woman on earth. This woman was Helen, who was already married to King Menelaus of Sparta. Paris selected Aphrodite and awarded her the apple. The other two goddesses were enraged and, as a direct result, sided with the Greeks in the Trojan War.

Aphrodite plays an important and active role throughout the entirety of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;. In Book III, she rescues Paris from Menelaus after he foolishly challenges him to a one-on-one duel. She then appears to Helen in the form of an old woman and attempts to persuade her to have sex with Paris, reminding her of his physical beauty and athletic prowess. Helen immediately recognizes Aphrodite by her beautiful neck, perfect breasts, and flashing eyes and chides the goddess, addressing her as her equal. Aphrodite sharply rebukes Helen, reminding her that, if she vexes her, she will punish her just as much as she has favored her already. Helen demurely obeys Aphrodite&#x27;s command.

In Book V, Aphrodite charges into battle to rescue her son Aeneas from the Greek hero Diomedes. Diomedes recognizes Aphrodite as a &quot;weakling&quot; goddess and, thrusting his spear, nicks her wrist through her &quot;ambrosial robe&quot;. Aphrodite borrows Ares&#x27;s chariot to ride back to Mount Olympus. Zeus chides her for putting herself in danger, reminding her that &quot;her specialty is love, not war.&quot; According to Walter Burkert, this scene directly parallels a scene from Tablet VI of the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; in which Ishtar, Aphrodite&#x27;s Akkadian precursor, cries to her mother Antu after the hero Gilgamesh rejects her sexual advances, but is mildly rebuked by her father Anu. In Book XIV of the &quot;Iliad&quot;, during the &quot;Dios Apate&quot; episode, Aphrodite lends her &quot;kestos himas&quot; to Hera for the purpose of seducing Zeus and distracting him from the combat while Poseidon aids the Greek forces on the beach. In the &quot;Theomachia&quot; in Book XXI, Aphrodite again enters the battlefield to carry Ares away after he is wounded.

===Offspring===
Sometimes poets and dramatists recounted ancient traditions, which varied, and sometimes they invented new details; later scholiasts might draw on either or simply guess. Thus while Aeneas and Phobos were regularly described as offspring of Aphrodite, others listed here such as Priapus and Eros were sometimes said to be children of Aphrodite but with varying fathers and sometimes given other mothers or none at all.

==Iconography==
===Symbols===


Aphrodite&#x27;s most prominent avian symbol was the dove, which was originally an important symbol of her Near Eastern precursor Inanna-Ishtar. (In fact, the ancient Greek word for &quot;dove&quot;, &quot;peristerá&quot;, may be derived from a Semitic phrase &quot;peraḥ Ištar&quot;, meaning &quot;bird of Ishtar&quot;.) Aphrodite frequently appears with doves in ancient Greek pottery and the temple of Aphrodite Pandemos on the southwest slope of the Athenian Acropolis was decorated with relief sculptures of doves with knotted fillets in their beaks. Votive offerings of small, white, marble doves were also discovered in the temple of Aphrodite at Daphni. In addition to her associations with doves, Aphrodite was also closely linked with sparrows and she is described riding in a chariot pulled by sparrows in Sappho&#x27;s &quot;Ode to Aphrodite&quot;. According to myth, the dove was originally a nymph named Peristera who helped Aphrodite win in a flower-picking contest over her son Eros; for this Eros turned her into a dove, but Aphrodite took the dove under her wing and made it her sacred bird.

Because of her connections to the sea, Aphrodite was associated with a number of different types of water fowl, including swans, geese, and ducks. Aphrodite&#x27;s other symbols included the sea, conch shells, and roses. The rose and myrtle flowers were both sacred to Aphrodite. A myth explaining the origin of Aphrodite&#x27;s connection to myrtle goes that originally the myrtle was a maiden, Myrina, a dedicated priestess of Aphrodite. When her previous betrothed carried her away from the temple to marry her, Myrina killed him, and Aphrodite turned her into a myrtle, forever under her protection. Her most important fruit emblem was the apple, and in myth, she turned Melos, childhood friend and kin-in-law to Adonis, into an apple after he killed himself, mourning over Adonis&#x27; death. Likewise, Melos&#x27;s wife Pelia was turned into a dove. She was also associated with pomegranates, possibly because the red seeds suggested sexuality or because Greek women sometimes used pomegranates as a method of birth control. In Greek art, Aphrodite is often also accompanied by dolphins and Nereids.

===In classical art===

A scene of Aphrodite rising from the sea appears on the back of the Ludovisi Throne ( 460 BC), which was probably originally part of a massive altar that was constructed as part of the Ionic temple to Aphrodite in the Greek polis of Locri Epizephyrii in Magna Graecia in southern Italy. The throne shows Aphrodite rising from the sea, clad in a diaphanous garment, which is drenched with seawater and clinging to her body, revealing her upturned breasts and the outline of her navel. Her hair hangs dripping as she reaches to two attendants standing barefoot on the rocky shore on either side of her, lifting her out of the water. Scenes with Aphrodite appear in works of classical Greek pottery, including a famous white-ground &quot;kylix&quot; by the Pistoxenos Painter dating the between 470 and 460 BC, showing her riding on a swan or goose. Aphrodite was often described as golden-haired and portrayed with this color hair in art.

In BC, the Athenian sculptor Praxiteles carved the marble statue &quot;Aphrodite of Knidos&quot;, which Pliny the Elder later praised as the greatest sculpture ever made. The statue showed a nude Aphrodite modestly covering her pubic region while resting against a water pot with her robe draped over it for support. The &quot;Aphrodite of Knidos&quot; was the first full-sized statue to depict Aphrodite completely naked and one of the first sculptures that was intended to be viewed from all sides. The statue was purchased by the people of Knidos in around 350 BC and proved to be tremendously influential on later depictions of Aphrodite. The original sculpture has been lost, but written descriptions of it as well several depictions of it on coins are still extant and over sixty copies, small-scale models, and fragments of it have been identified.

The Greek painter Apelles of Kos, a contemporary of Praxiteles, produced the panel painting &quot;Aphrodite Anadyomene&quot; (&quot;Aphrodite Rising from the Sea&quot;). According to Athenaeus, Apelles was inspired to paint the painting after watching the courtesan Phryne take off her clothes, untie her hair, and bathe naked in the sea at Eleusis. The painting was displayed in the Asclepeion on the island of Kos. The &quot;Aphrodite Anadyomene&quot; went unnoticed for centuries, but Pliny the Elder records that, in his own time, it was regarded as Apelles&#x27;s most famous work.

During the Hellenistic and Roman periods, statues depicting Aphrodite proliferated; many of these statues were modeled at least to some extent on Praxiteles&#x27;s &quot;Aphrodite of Knidos&quot;. Some statues show Aphrodite crouching naked; others show her wringing water out of her hair as she rises from the sea. Another common type of statue is known as &quot;Aphrodite Kallipygos&quot;, the name of which is Greek for &quot;Aphrodite of the Beautiful Buttocks&quot;; this type of sculpture shows Aphrodite lifting her &quot;peplos&quot; to display her buttocks to the viewer while looking back at them from over her shoulder. The ancient Romans produced massive numbers of copies of Greek sculptures of Aphrodite and more sculptures of Aphrodite have survived from antiquity than of any other deity.


==Post-classical culture==
===Middle Ages===
Early Christians frequently adapted pagan iconography to suit Christian purposes. In the Early Middle Ages, Christians adapted elements of Aphrodite/Venus&#x27;s iconography and applied them to Eve and prostitutes, but also female saints and even the Virgin Mary. Christians in the east reinterpreted the story of Aphrodite&#x27;s birth as a metaphor for baptism; in a Coptic stele from the sixth century AD, a female orant is shown wearing Aphrodite&#x27;s conch shell as a sign that she is newly baptized. Throughout the Middle Ages, villages and communities across Europe still maintained folk tales and traditions about Aphrodite/Venus and travelers reported a wide variety of stories. Numerous Roman mosaics of Venus survived in Britain, preserving memory of the pagan past. In North Africa in the late fifth century AD, Fulgentius of Ruspe encountered mosaics of Aphrodite and reinterpreted her as a symbol of the sin of Lust, arguing that she was shown naked because &quot;the sin of lust is never cloaked&quot; and that she was often shown &quot;swimming&quot; because &quot;all lust suffers shipwreck of its affairs.&quot; He also argued that she was associated with doves and conches because these are symbols of copulation, and that she was associated with roses because &quot;as the rose gives pleasure, but is swept away by the swift movement of the seasons, so lust is pleasant for a moment, but is swept away forever.&quot;

While Fulgentius had appropriated Aphrodite as a symbol of Lust, Isidore of Seville ( 560–636) interpreted her as a symbol of marital procreative sex and declared that the moral of the story of Aphrodite&#x27;s birth is that sex can only be holy in the presence of semen, blood, and heat, which he regarded as all being necessary for procreation. Meanwhile, Isidore denigrated Aphrodite/Venus&#x27;s son Eros/Cupid as a &quot;demon of fornication&quot; (&quot;daemon fornicationis&quot;). Aphrodite/Venus was best known to Western European scholars through her appearances in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; and Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. Venus is mentioned in the Latin poem &quot;Pervigilium Veneris&quot; (&quot;The Eve of Saint Venus&quot;), written in the third or fourth century AD, and in Giovanni Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;Genealogia Deorum Gentilium&quot;.

Since the Late Middle Ages. the myth of the &quot;Venusberg&quot; (German; French &quot;Mont de Vénus&quot;, &quot;Mountain of Venus&quot;) – a subterranean realm ruled by Venus, hidden underneath Christian Europe – became a motif of European folklore rendered in various legends and epics. In German folklore of the 16th century, the narrative becomes associated with the minnesinger Tannhäuser, and in that form the myth was taken up in later literature and opera.

===Art===
Aphrodite is the central figure in Sandro Botticelli&#x27;s painting &quot;Primavera&quot;, which has been described as &quot;one of the most written about, and most controversial paintings in the world&quot;, and &quot;one of the most popular paintings in Western art&quot;. The story of Aphrodite&#x27;s birth from the foam was a popular subject matter for painters during the Italian Renaissance, who were attempting to consciously reconstruct Apelles of Kos&#x27;s lost masterpiece &quot;Aphrodite Anadyomene&quot; based on the literary &quot;ekphrasis&quot; of it preserved by Cicero and Pliny the Elder. Artists also drew inspiration from Ovid&#x27;s description of the birth of Venus in his &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. Sandro Botticelli&#x27;s &quot;The Birth of Venus&quot; ( 1485) was also partially inspired by a description by Poliziano of a relief on the subject. Later Italian renditions of the same scene include Titian&#x27;s &quot;Venus Anadyomene&quot; () and Raphael&#x27;s painting in the &quot;Stufetta del cardinal Bibbiena&quot; (1516). Titian&#x27;s biographer Giorgio Vasari identified all of Titian&#x27;s paintings of naked women as paintings of &quot;Venus&quot;, including an erotic painting from , which he called the &quot;Venus of Urbino&quot;, even though the painting does not contain any of Aphrodite/Venus&#x27;s traditional iconography and the woman in it is clearly shown in a contemporary setting, not a classical one.
&quot;The Birth of Venus&quot; (1863) by Alexandre Cabanel Jacques-Louis David&#x27;s final work was his 1824 &quot;magnum opus&quot;, &quot;Mars Being Disarmed by Venus&quot;, which combines elements of classical, Renaissance, traditional French art, and contemporary artistic styles. While he was working on the painting, David described it, saying, &quot;This is the last picture I want to paint, but I want to surpass myself in it. I will put the date of my seventy-five years on it and afterwards I will never again pick up my brush.&quot; The painting was exhibited first in Brussels and then in Paris, where over 10,000 people came to see it. Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres&#x27;s painting &quot;Venus Anadyomene&quot; was one of his major works. Louis Geofroy described it as a &quot;dream of youth realized with the power of maturity, a happiness that few obtain, artists or others.&quot; Théophile Gautier declared: &quot;Nothing remains of the marvelous painting of the Greeks, but surely if anything could give the idea of antique painting as it was conceived following the statues of Phidias and the poems of Homer, it is M. Ingres&#x27;s painting: the &quot;Venus Anadyomene&quot; of Apelles has been found.&quot; Other critics dismissed it as a piece of unimaginative, sentimental kitsch, but Ingres himself considered it to be among his greatest works and used the same figure as the model for his later 1856 painting &quot;La Source&quot;.

Paintings of Venus were favorites of the late nineteenth-century Academic artists in France. In 1863, Alexandre Cabanel won widespread critical acclaim at the Paris Salon for his painting &quot;The Birth of Venus&quot;, which the French emperor Napoleon III immediately purchased for his own personal art collection. Édouard Manet&#x27;s 1865 painting &quot;Olympia&quot; parodied the nude Venuses of the Academic painters, particularly Cabanel&#x27;s &quot;Birth of Venus&quot;. In 1867, the English Academic painter Frederic Leighton displayed his &quot;Venus Disrobing for the Bath&quot; at the academy. The art critic J. B. Atkinson praised it, declaring that &quot;Mr Leighton, instead of adopting corrupt Roman notions regarding Venus such as Rubens embodied, has wisely reverted to the Greek idea of Aphrodite, a goddess worshipped, and by artists painted, as the perfection of female grace and beauty.&quot; A year later, the English painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti, a founding member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, painted &quot;Venus Verticordia&quot; (Latin for &quot;Aphrodite, the Changer of Hearts&quot;), showing Aphrodite as a nude red-headed woman in a garden of roses. Though he was reproached for his &quot;outré&quot; subject matter, Rossetti refused to alter the painting and it was soon purchased by J. Mitchell of Bradford. In 1879, William Adolphe Bouguereau exhibited at the Paris Salon his own &quot;Birth of Venus&quot;, which imitated the classical tradition of &quot;contrapposto&quot; and was met with widespread critical acclaim, rivalling the popularity of Cabanel&#x27;s version from nearly two decades prior.
===Literature===
William Shakespeare&#x27;s erotic narrative poem &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot; (1593), a retelling of the courtship of Aphrodite and Adonis from Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, was the most popular of all his works published within his own lifetime. Six editions of it were published before Shakespeare&#x27;s death (more than any of his other works) and it enjoyed particularly strong popularity among young adults. In 1605, Richard Barnfield lauded it, declaring that the poem had placed Shakespeare&#x27;s name &quot;in fames immortall Booke&quot;. Despite this, the poem has received mixed reception from modern critics; Samuel Taylor Coleridge defended it, but Samuel Butler complained that it bored him and C. S. Lewis described an attempted reading of it as &quot;suffocating&quot;.

Aphrodite appears in Richard Garnett&#x27;s short story collection &quot;The Twilight of the Gods and Other Tales&quot; (1888), in which the gods&#x27; temples have been destroyed by Christians. Stories revolving around sculptures of Aphrodite were common in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Examples of such works of literature include the novel &quot;The Tinted Venus: A Farcical Romance&quot; (1885) by Thomas Anstey Guthrie and the short story &quot;The Venus of Ille&quot; (1887) by Prosper Mérimée, both of which are about statues of Aphrodite that come to life. Another noteworthy example is &quot;Aphrodite in Aulis&quot; by the Anglo-Irish writer George Moore, which revolves around an ancient Greek family who moves to Aulis. The French writer Pierre Louÿs titled his erotic historical novel &quot;&quot; (1896) after the Greek goddess. The novel enjoyed widespread commercial success, but scandalized French audiences due to its sensuality and its decadent portrayal of Greek society.

In the early twentieth century, stories of Aphrodite were used by feminist poets, such as Amy Lowell and Alicia Ostriker. Many of these poems dealt with Aphrodite&#x27;s legendary birth from the foam of the sea. Other feminist writers, including Claude Cahun, Thit Jensen, and Anaïs Nin also made use of the myth of Aphrodite in their writings. Ever since the publication of Isabel Allende&#x27;s book &quot;Aphrodite: A Memoir of the Senses&quot; in 1998, the name &quot;Aphrodite&quot; has been used as a title for dozens of books dealing with all topics even superficially connected to her domain. Frequently these books do not even mention Aphrodite, or mention her only briefly, but make use of her name as a selling point.

===Modern worship===
In 1938, Gleb Botkin, a Russian immigrant to the United States, founded the Church of Aphrodite, a neopagan religion centered around the worship of a mother goddess, whom its practitioners identified as Aphrodite. The Church of Aphrodite&#x27;s theology was laid out in the book &quot;In Search of Reality&quot;, published in 1969, two years before Botkin&#x27;s death. The book portrayed Aphrodite in a drastically different light than the one in which the Greeks envisioned her, instead casting her as &quot;the sole Goddess of a somewhat Neoplatonic Pagan monotheism&quot;. It claimed that the worship of Aphrodite had been brought to Greece by the mystic teacher Orpheus, but that the Greeks had misunderstood Orpheus&#x27;s teachings and had not realized the importance of worshipping Aphrodite alone.

Aphrodite is a major deity in Wicca, a contemporary nature-based syncretic Neopagan religion. Wiccans regard Aphrodite as one aspect of the Goddess and she is frequently invoked by name during enchantments dealing with love and romance. Wiccans regard Aphrodite as the ruler of human emotions, erotic spirituality, creativity, and art. As one of the twelve Olympians, Aphrodite is a major deity within Hellenismos (Hellenic Polytheistic Reconstructionism), a Neopagan religion which seeks to authentically revive and recreate the religion of ancient Greece in the modern world. Unlike Wiccans, Hellenists are usually strictly polytheistic or pantheistic. Hellenists venerate Aphrodite primarily as the goddess of romantic love, but also as a goddess of sexuality, the sea, and war. Her many epithets include &quot;Sea Born&quot;, &quot;Killer of Men&quot;, &quot;She upon the Graves&quot;, &quot;Fair Sailing&quot;, and &quot;Ally in War&quot;.

<doc id="1176" wikidata="Q583760" url="?curid=1176" title="Antisymmetric relation">
<text>In mathematics, a binary relation formula_1 on a set formula_2 is antisymmetric if there is no pair of &quot;distinct&quot; elements of formula_2 each of which is related by formula_1 to the other. More formally, formula_1 is antisymmetric precisely if for all formula_6
formula_7
or equivalently,
formula_8
The definition of antisymmetry says nothing about whether formula_9 actually holds or not for any formula_10. An antisymmetric relation formula_1 on a set formula_2 may be reflexive (that is, formula_9 for all formula_14), irreflexive (that is, formula_9 for no formula_14), or neither reflexive nor irreflexive. A relation is asymmetric if and only if it is both antisymmetric and irreflexive.

== Examples ==

The divisibility relation on the natural numbers is an important example of an antisymmetric relation. In this context, antisymmetry means that the only way each of two numbers can be divisible by the other is if the two are, in fact, the same number; equivalently, if formula_17 and formula_18 are distinct and formula_17 is a factor of formula_20 then formula_18 cannot be a factor of formula_22 For example, 12 is divisible by 4, but 4 is not divisible by 12.

The usual order relation formula_23 on the real numbers is antisymmetric: if for two real numbers formula_24 and formula_25 both inequalities formula_26 and formula_27 hold, then formula_24 and formula_25 must be equal. Similarly, the subset order formula_30 on the subsets of any given set is antisymmetric: given two sets formula_31 and formula_32 if every element in formula_31 also is in formula_34 and every element in formula_34 is also in formula_36 then formula_31 and formula_34 must contain all the same elements and therefore be equal:
formula_39
A real-life example of a relation that is typically antisymmetric is &quot;paid the restaurant bill of&quot; (understood as restricted to a given occasion). Typically, some people pay their own bills, while others pay for their spouses or friends. As long as no two people pay each other&#x27;s bills, the relation is antisymmetric.

== Properties ==

Partial and total orders are antisymmetric by definition. A relation can be both symmetric and antisymmetric (in this case, it must be coreflexive), and there are relations which are neither symmetric nor antisymmetric (for example, the &quot;preys on&quot; relation on biological species).

Antisymmetry is different from asymmetry: a relation is asymmetric if and only if it is antisymmetric and irreflexive.

<doc id="1177" wikidata="Q172684" url="?curid=1177" title="Aleister Crowley">
<text>Aleister Crowley ( ; born Edward Alexander Crowley; 12 October 1875 – 1 December 1947) was an English occultist, ceremonial magician, poet, novelist, mountaineer, and painter. He founded the religion of Thelema, identifying himself as the prophet entrusted with guiding humanity into the Æon of Horus in the early 20th century. A prolific writer, he published widely over the course of his life.

Born to a wealthy family in Royal Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, Crowley rejected his parents&#x27; fundamentalist Christian Plymouth Brethren faith to pursue an interest in Western esotericism. He was educated at Trinity College at the University of Cambridge, where he focused his attention upon mountaineering and poetry, resulting in several publications. Some biographers allege that here he was recruited into a British intelligence agency, further suggesting that he remained a spy throughout his life. In 1898, he joined the esoteric Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, where he was trained in ceremonial magic by Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers and Allan Bennett. He went mountaineering in Mexico with Oscar Eckenstein, before studying Hindu and Buddhist practices in India. In 1904, he married Rose Edith Kelly, and they honeymooned in Cairo, Egypt, where Crowley wrote down &quot;The Book of the Law&quot;—a sacred text that serves as the basis for Thelema, which he said had been dictated to him by a supernatural entity named Aiwass. &quot;The Book&quot; announced the start of the Æon of Horus, and declared that its followers should &quot;Do what thou wilt&quot;, and seek to align themselves with their True Will via the practice of ceremonial magic.

After the unsuccessful 1905 Kanchenjunga expedition, and a visit to India and China, Crowley returned to Britain, where he attracted attention as a prolific author of poetry, novels, and occult literature. In 1907, he and George Cecil Jones co-founded an esoteric order—the A∴A∴, through which they propagated Thelema. After spending time in Algeria, in 1912 he was initiated into another esoteric order—the German-based Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.), in which he rose to become the leader of its British branch, which he reformulated in accordance with his Thelemite beliefs. Through O.T.O., Thelemite groups were established in Britain, Australia, and North America. Crowley spent the First World War in the United States, where he took up painting, and campaigned for the German war effort against Britain. His biographers later revealed that he had infiltrated the pro-German movement to assist the British intelligence services. In 1920, he established the Abbey of Thelema—a religious commune in Cefalù, Sicily, where he lived with various followers. His libertine lifestyle led to denunciations in the British press, and the Italian government evicted him in 1923. He divided the following two decades between France, Germany, and England, and continued to promote Thelema until his death.

Crowley gained widespread notoriety during his lifetime, being a drug user, a bisexual, and an individualist social critic. Crowley has remained a highly influential figure over western esotericism and the counterculture of the 1960s, and he continues to be considered a prophet in Thelema. He is the subject of various biographies and academic studies.

==Early life==

===Youth===
Crowley was born Edward Alexander Crowley at 30 Clarendon Square in Royal Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, on 12 October 1875. His father, Edward Crowley (1829–1887), was trained as an engineer, but his share in a lucrative family brewing business, Crowley&#x27;s Alton Ales, allowed him to retire before his son was born. His mother, Emily Bertha Bishop (1848–1917), came from a Devonshire-Somerset family and had a strained relationship with her son; she described him as &quot;the Beast&quot;, a name that he revelled in. The couple had been married at London&#x27;s Kensington Registry Office in November 1874, and were evangelical Christians. Crowley&#x27;s father was born a Quaker, but converted to the Exclusive Brethren, a faction of a Christian fundamentalist group known as the Plymouth Brethren; Emily likewise converted upon marriage. Crowley&#x27;s father was particularly devout, spending his time as a travelling preacher for the sect and reading a chapter from the Bible to his wife and son after breakfast every day. Following the death of their baby daughter in 1880, in 1881 the Crowleys moved to Redhill, Surrey. At the age of 8, Crowley was sent to H. T. Habershon&#x27;s evangelical Christian boarding school in Hastings, and then to Ebor preparatory school in Cambridge, run by the Reverend Henry d&#x27;Arcy Champney, whom Crowley considered a sadist.

In March 1887, when Crowley was eleven years old, his father died of tongue cancer. Crowley described this as a turning point in his life, and he always maintained an admiration of his father, describing him as &quot;my hero and my friend&quot;. Inheriting a third of his father&#x27;s wealth, he began misbehaving at school and was harshly punished by Champney; Crowley&#x27;s family removed him from the school when he developed albuminuria. He then attended Malvern College and Tonbridge School, both of which he despised and left after a few terms. He became increasingly sceptical of Christianity, pointing out Biblical inconsistencies to his religious teachers, and went against the Christian morality of his upbringing by smoking, masturbating, and having sex with prostitutes from whom he contracted gonorrhea. Sent to live with a Brethren tutor in Eastbourne, he undertook chemistry courses at Eastbourne College. Crowley developed interests in chess, poetry, and mountain climbing, and in 1894 climbed Beachy Head before visiting the Alps and joining the Scottish Mountaineering Club. The following year he returned to the Bernese Alps, climbing the Eiger, Trift, Jungfrau, Mönch, and Wetterhorn.

===Cambridge University: 1895–1898===
Having adopted the name of Aleister over Edward, in October 1895 Crowley began a three-year course at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was entered for the Moral Science Tripos studying philosophy. With approval from his personal tutor, he changed to English literature, which was not then part of the curriculum offered. Crowley spent much of his time at university engaged in his pastimes, becoming president of the chess club and practising the game for two hours a day; he briefly considered a professional career as a chess player. Crowley also embraced his love of literature and poetry, particularly the works of Richard Francis Burton and Percy Bysshe Shelley. Many of his own poems appeared in student publications such as &quot;The Granta&quot;, &quot;Cambridge Magazine&quot;, and &quot;Cantab&quot;. He continued his mountaineering, going on holiday to the Alps to climb every year from 1894 to 1898, often with his friend Oscar Eckenstein, and in 1897 he made the first ascent of the Mönch without a guide. These feats led to his recognition in the Alpine mountaineering community.

Crowley had his first significant mystical experience while on holiday in Stockholm in December 1896. Several biographers, including Lawrence Sutin, Richard Kaczynski, and Tobias Churton, believed that this was the result of Crowley&#x27;s first same-sex sexual experience, which enabled him to recognize his bisexuality. At Cambridge, Crowley maintained a vigorous sex life with women—largely with female prostitutes, from one of whom he caught syphilis—but eventually he took part in same-sex activities, despite their illegality. In October 1897, Crowley met Herbert Charles Pollitt, president of the Cambridge University Footlights Dramatic Club, and the two entered into a relationship. They broke apart because Pollitt did not share Crowley&#x27;s increasing interest in Western esotericism, a break-up that Crowley regretted for many years.

In 1897, Crowley travelled to Saint Petersburg in Russia, later saying that he was trying to learn Russian as he was considering a future diplomatic career there. In October 1897, a brief illness triggered considerations of mortality and &quot;the futility of all human endeavour&quot;, and Crowley abandoned all thoughts of a diplomatic career in favour of pursuing an interest in the occult.

In March 1898, he obtained A. E. Waite&#x27;s &quot;The Book of Black Magic and of Pacts&quot;, and then Karl von Eckartshausen&#x27;s &quot;The Cloud Upon the Sanctuary&quot;, furthering his occult interests. That same year, Leonard Smithers, a publisher who Crowley met through Pollitt, published 100 copies of Crowley&#x27;s poem &quot;Aceldama: A Place to Bury Strangers In&quot;, but it was not a particular success. That same year, Crowley published a string of other poems, including &quot;White Stains&quot;, a Decadent collection of erotic poetry that was printed abroad lest its publication be prohibited by the British authorities. In July 1898, he left Cambridge, not having taken any degree at all despite a &quot;first class&quot; showing in his 1897 exams and consistent &quot;second class honours&quot; results before that.
===The Golden Dawn: 1898–1899===

In August 1898, Crowley was in Zermatt, Switzerland, where he met the chemist Julian L. Baker, and the two began discussing their common interest in alchemy. Back in London, Baker introduced Crowley to George Cecil Jones, Baker&#x27;s brother-in-law and a fellow member of the occult society known as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, which was founded in 1888. Crowley was initiated into the Outer Order of the Golden Dawn on 18 November 1898 by the group&#x27;s leader, Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers. The ceremony took place in the Golden Dawn&#x27;s Isis-Urania Temple held at London&#x27;s Mark Masons Hall, where Crowley took the magical motto and name &quot;Frater Perdurabo&quot;, which he interpreted as &quot;Brother I shall endure to the end&quot;.

Crowley moved into his own luxury flat at 67–69 Chancery Lane and soon invited a senior Golden Dawn member, Allan Bennett, to live with him as his personal magical tutor. Bennett taught Crowley more about ceremonial magic and the ritual use of drugs, and together they performed the rituals of the &quot;Goetia&quot;, until Bennett left for South Asia to study Buddhism. In November 1899, Crowley purchased Boleskine House in Foyers on the shore of Loch Ness in Scotland. He developed a love of Scottish culture, describing himself as the &quot;Laird of Boleskine&quot;, and took to wearing traditional highland dress, even during visits to London. He continued writing poetry, publishing &quot;Jezebel and Other Tragic Poems&quot;, &quot;Tales of Archais&quot;, &quot;Songs of the Spirit&quot;, &quot;Appeal to the American Republic&quot;, and &quot;Jephthah&quot; in 1898–99; most gained mixed reviews from literary critics, although &quot;Jephthah&quot; was considered a particular critical success.

Crowley soon progressed through the lower grades of the Golden Dawn, and was ready to enter the group&#x27;s inner Second Order. He was unpopular in the group; his bisexuality and libertine lifestyle gained him a bad reputation, and he developed feuds with some of the members, including W. B. Yeats. When the Golden Dawn&#x27;s London lodge refused to initiate Crowley into the Second Order, he visited Mathers in Paris, who personally admitted him into the Adeptus Minor Grade. A schism had developed between Mathers and the London members of the Golden Dawn, who were unhappy with his autocratic rule. Acting under Mathers&#x27; orders, Crowley—with the help of his mistress and fellow initiate Elaine Simpson—attempted to seize the Vault of the Adepts, a temple space at 36 Blythe Road in West Kensington, from the London lodge members. When the case was taken to court, the judge ruled in favour of the London lodge, as they had paid for the space&#x27;s rent, leaving both Crowley and Mathers isolated from the group.

===Mexico, India, Paris, and marriage: 1900–1903===
In 1900, Crowley travelled to Mexico via the United States, settling in Mexico City and starting a relationship with a local woman. Developing a love of the country, he continued experimenting with ceremonial magic, working with John Dee&#x27;s Enochian invocations. He later said he had been initiated into Freemasonry while there, and he wrote a play based on Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; as well as a series of poems, published as &quot;Oracles&quot; (1905). Eckenstein joined him later in 1900, and together they climbed several mountains, including Iztaccihuatl, Popocatepetl, and Colima, the latter of which they had to abandon owing to a volcanic eruption. Leaving Mexico, Crowley headed to San Francisco before sailing for Hawaii aboard the &quot;Nippon Maru&quot;. On the ship, he had a brief affair with a married woman named Mary Alice Rogers; saying he fell in love with her, he wrote a series of poems about the romance, published as &quot;Alice: An Adultery&quot; (1903).
Briefly stopping in Japan and Hong Kong, Crowley reached Ceylon, where he met with Allan Bennett, who was there studying Shaivism. The pair spent some time in Kandy before Bennett decided to become a Buddhist monk in the Theravada tradition, travelling to Burma to do so. Crowley decided to tour India, devoting himself to the Hindu practice of &quot;Rāja yoga&quot;, by which means he believed he had achieved the spiritual state of &quot;dhyana&quot;. He spent much of this time studying at the Meenakshi Temple in Madura. At this time he also wrote poetry which was published as &quot;The Sword of Song&quot; (1904). He contracted malaria, and had to recuperate from the disease in Calcutta and Rangoon. In 1902, he was joined in India by Eckenstein and several other mountaineers: Guy Knowles, H. Pfannl, V. Wesseley, and Jules Jacot-Guillarmod. Together, the Eckenstein-Crowley expedition attempted K2, which was never climbed before. On the journey, Crowley was afflicted with influenza, malaria, and snow blindness, and other expedition members were also struck with illness. They reached an altitude of before turning back.

Having arrived in Paris in November 1902, he socialized with his friend the painter Gerald Kelly, and through him became a fixture of the Parisian arts scene. Whilst there, Crowley wrote a series of poems on the work of an acquaintance, the sculptor Auguste Rodin. These poems were later published as &quot;Rodin in Rime&quot; (1907). One of those frequenting this milieu was W. Somerset Maugham, who after briefly meeting Crowley later used him as a model for the character of Oliver Haddo in his novel &quot;The Magician&quot; (1908). He returned to Boleskine in April 1903. In August, Crowley wed Gerald Kelly&#x27;s sister Rose Edith Kelly in a &quot;marriage of convenience&quot; to prevent her from entering an arranged marriage; the marriage appalled the Kelly family and damaged his friendship with Gerald. Heading on a honeymoon to Paris, Cairo, and then Ceylon, Crowley fell in love with Rose and worked to prove his affections. While on his honeymoon, he wrote her a series of love poems, published as &quot;Rosa Mundi and other Love Songs&quot; (1906), as well as authoring the religious satire &quot;Why Jesus Wept&quot; (1904).

==Developing Thelema==

===Egypt and &quot;The Book of the Law&quot;: 1904===

In February 1904, Crowley and Rose arrived in Cairo. Pretending to be a prince and princess, they rented an apartment in which Crowley set up a temple room and began invoking ancient Egyptian deities, while studying Islamic mysticism and Arabic. According to Crowley&#x27;s later account, Rose regularly became delirious and informed him &quot;they are waiting for you.&quot; On 18 March, she explained that &quot;they&quot; were the god Horus, and on 20 March proclaimed that &quot;the Equinox of the Gods has come&quot;. She led him to a nearby museum, where she showed him a seventh-century BCE mortuary stele known as the Stele of Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu; Crowley thought it important that the exhibit&#x27;s number was 666, the Number of the Beast in Christian belief, and in later years termed the artefact the &quot;Stele of Revealing&quot;.

According to Crowley&#x27;s later statements, on 8 April he heard a disembodied voice identifying itself as that of Aiwass, the messenger of Horus, or Hoor-Paar-Kraat. Crowley said that he wrote down everything the voice told him over the course of the next three days, and titled it &quot;Liber AL vel Legis&quot; or &quot;The Book of the Law&quot;. The book proclaimed that humanity was entering a new Aeon, and that Crowley would serve as its prophet. It stated that a supreme moral law was to be introduced in this Aeon, &quot;Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law,&quot; and that people should learn to live in tune with their Will. This book, and the philosophy that it espoused, became the cornerstone of Crowley&#x27;s religion, Thelema. Crowley said that at the time he was unsure what to do with &quot;The Book of the Law&quot;. Often resenting it, he said that he ignored the instructions which the text commanded him to perform, which included taking the Stele of Revealing from the museum, fortifying his own island, and translating the book into all the world&#x27;s languages. According to his account, he instead sent typescripts of the work to several occultists he knew, putting the manuscript away and ignoring it.

===Kanchenjunga and China: 1905–1906===
Returning to Boleskine, Crowley came to believe that Mathers was using magic against him, and the relationship between the two broke down. On 28 July 1905, Rose gave birth to Crowley&#x27;s first child, a daughter named Lilith, and Crowley wrote the pornographic &quot;Snowdrops from a Curate&#x27;s Garden&quot; to entertain his recuperating wife. He also founded a publishing company through which to publish his poetry, naming it the Society for the Propagation of Religious Truth in parody of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. Among its first publications were Crowley&#x27;s &quot;Collected Works&quot;, edited by Ivor Back, an old friend of Crowley&#x27;s who was both a practicing surgeon and an enthusiast of literature. His poetry often received strong reviews (either positive or negative), but never sold well. In an attempt to gain more publicity, he issued a reward of £100 for the best essay on his work. The winner of this was J. F. C. Fuller, a British Army officer and military historian, whose essay, &quot;The Star in the West&quot; (1907), heralded Crowley&#x27;s poetry as some of the greatest ever written.

Crowley decided to climb Kanchenjunga in the Himalayas of Nepal, widely recognised as the world&#x27;s most treacherous mountain. The collaboration between Jacot-Guillarmod, Charles Adolphe Reymond, Alexis Pache, and Alcesti C. Rigo de Righi, the expedition was marred by much argument between Crowley and the others, who thought that he was reckless. They eventually mutinied against Crowley&#x27;s control, with the other climbers heading back down the mountain as nightfall approached despite Crowley&#x27;s warnings that it was too dangerous. Subsequently, Pache and several porters were killed in an accident, something for which Crowley was widely blamed by the mountaineering community.

Spending time in Moharbhanj, where he took part in big-game hunting and wrote the homoerotic work &quot;The Scented Garden&quot;, Crowley met up with Rose and Lilith in Calcutta before being forced to leave India after non-lethally shooting two men who tried to mug him. Briefly visiting Bennett in Burma, Crowley and his family decided to tour Southern China, hiring porters and a nanny for the purpose. Crowley smoked opium throughout the journey, which took the family from Tengyueh through to Yungchang, Tali, Yunnanfu, and then Hanoi. On the way, he spent much time on spiritual and magical work, reciting the &quot;Bornless Ritual&quot;, an invocation to his Holy Guardian Angel, on a daily basis.

While Rose and Lilith returned to Europe, Crowley headed to Shanghai to meet old friend Elaine Simpson, who was fascinated by &quot;The Book of the Law&quot;; together they performed rituals in an attempt to contact Aiwass. Crowley then sailed to Japan and Canada, before continuing to New York City, where he unsuccessfully solicited support for a second expedition up Kanchenjunga. Upon arrival in Britain, Crowley learned that his daughter Lilith had died of typhoid in Rangoon, something he later blamed on Rose&#x27;s increasing alcoholism. Under emotional distress, his health began to suffer, and he underwent a series of surgical operations. He began short-lived romances with actress Vera &quot;Lola&quot; Neville (née Snepp) and author Ada Leverson, while Rose gave birth to Crowley&#x27;s second daughter, Lola Zaza, in February 1907.

===The A∴A∴ and The Holy Books of Thelema: 1907–1909===
With his old mentor George Cecil Jones, Crowley continued performing the Abramelin rituals at the Ashdown Park Hotel in Coulsdon, Surrey. Crowley believed that in doing so he attained &quot;samadhi&quot;, or union with Godhead, thereby marking a turning point in his life. Making heavy use of hashish during these rituals, he wrote an essay on &quot;The Psychology of Hashish&quot; (1909) in which he championed the drug as an aid to mysticism. He also said he had been contacted once again by Aiwass in late October and November 1907, adding that Aiwass dictated two further texts to him, &quot;Liber VII&quot; and &quot;Liber Cordis Cincti Serpente&quot;, both of which were later classified in the corpus of The Holy Books of Thelema. Crowley wrote down more Thelemic Holy Books during the last two months of the year, including &quot;Liber LXVI&quot;, &quot;Liber Arcanorum&quot;, &quot;Liber Porta Lucis, Sub Figura X&quot;, &quot;Liber Tau&quot;, &quot;Liber Trigrammaton&quot; and &quot;Liber DCCCXIII vel Ararita&quot;, which he again said he had received from a preternatural source. Crowley stated that in June 1909, when the manuscript of &quot;The Book of the Law&quot; was rediscovered at Boleskine, he developed the opinion that Thelema represented objective truth.

Crowley&#x27;s inheritance was running out. Trying to earn money, he was hired by George Montagu Bennett, the Earl of Tankerville, to help protect him from witchcraft; recognising Bennett&#x27;s paranoia as being based in his cocaine addiction, Crowley took him on holiday to France and Morocco to recuperate. In 1907, he also began taking in paying students, whom he instructed in occult and magical practice. Victor Neuburg, whom Crowley met in February 1907, became his sexual partner and closest disciple; in 1908 the pair toured northern Spain before heading to Tangier, Morocco. The following year Neuburg stayed at Boleskine, where he and Crowley engaged in sadomasochism. Crowley continued to write prolifically, producing such works of poetry as &quot;Ambergris&quot;, &quot;Clouds Without Water&quot;, and &quot;Konx Om Pax&quot;, as well as his first attempt at an autobiography, &quot;The World&#x27;s Tragedy&quot;. Recognizing the popularity of short horror stories, Crowley wrote his own, some of which were published, and he also published several articles in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, a magazine edited by his friend Frank Harris. He also wrote &quot;Liber 777&quot;, a book of magical and Qabalistic correspondences that borrowed from Mathers and Bennett.

In November 1907, Crowley and Jones decided to found an occult order to act as a successor to the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, being aided in doing so by Fuller. The result was the A∴A∴. The group&#x27;s headquarters and temple were situated at 124 Victoria Street in central London, and their rites borrowed much from those of the Golden Dawn, but with an added Thelemic basis. Its earliest members included solicitor Richard Noel Warren, artist Austin Osman Spare, Horace Sheridan-Bickers, author George Raffalovich, Francis Henry Everard Joseph Feilding, engineer Herbert Edward Inman, Kenneth Ward, and Charles Stansfeld Jones. In March 1909, Crowley began production of a biannual periodical titled &quot;The Equinox&quot;. He billed this periodical, which was to become the &quot;Official Organ&quot; of the A∴A∴, as &quot;The Review of Scientific Illuminism&quot;.

Crowley became increasingly frustrated with Rose&#x27;s alcoholism, and in November 1909 he divorced her on the grounds of his own adultery. Lola was entrusted to Rose&#x27;s care; the couple remained friends and Rose continued to live at Boleskine. Her alcoholism worsened, and as a result she was institutionalized in September 1911.

===Algeria and the Rites of Eleusis: 1909–1911===
In November 1909, Crowley and Neuburg travelled to Algeria, touring the desert from El Arba to Aumale, Bou Saâda, and then Dā&#x27;leh Addin, with Crowley reciting the Quran to fortify himself against growing feelings of awe and dread. During the trip he invoked the thirty aethyrs of Enochian magic, with Neuburg recording the results, later published in &quot;The Equinox&quot; as &quot;The Vision and the Voice&quot;. Following a mountaintop sex magic ritual, Crowley also performed an evocation to the demon Choronzon involving blood sacrifice, and considered the results to be a watershed in his magical career. Returning to London in January 1910, Crowley found that Mathers was suing him for publishing Golden Dawn secrets in &quot;The Equinox&quot;; the court found in favour of Crowley. The case was widely reported in the press, with Crowley gaining wider fame. Crowley enjoyed this, and played up to the sensationalist stereotype of being a Satanist and advocate of human sacrifice, despite being neither.

The publicity attracted new members to the A∴A∴, among them Frank Bennett, James Bayley, Herbert Close, and James Windram. The Australian violinist Leila Waddell soon became Crowley&#x27;s lover. Deciding to expand his teachings to a wider audience, Crowley developed the Rites of Artemis, a public performance of magic and symbolism featuring A∴A∴ members personifying various deities. It was first performed at the A∴A∴ headquarters, with attendees given a fruit punch containing peyote to enhance their experience. Various members of the press attended, and reported largely positively on it. In October and November 1910, Crowley decided to stage something similar, the Rites of Eleusis, at Caxton Hall, Westminster; this time press reviews were mixed. Crowley came under particular criticism from West de Wend Fenton, editor of &quot;The Looking Glass&quot; newspaper, who called him &quot;one of the most blasphemous and cold-blooded villains of modern times&quot;. Fenton&#x27;s articles suggested that Crowley and Jones were involved in homosexual activity; Crowley did not mind, but Jones unsuccessfully sued for libel. Fuller broke off his friendship and involvement with Crowley over the scandal, and Crowley and Neuburg returned to Algeria for further magical workings.

&quot;The Equinox&quot; continued publishing, and various books of literature and poetry were also published under its imprint, like Crowley&#x27;s &quot;Ambergris&quot;, &quot;The Winged Beetle&quot;, and &quot;The Scented Garden&quot;, as well as Neuburg&#x27;s &quot;The Triumph of Pan&quot; and Ethel Archer&#x27;s &quot;The Whirlpool&quot;. In 1911, Crowley and Waddell holidayed in Montigny-sur-Loing, where he wrote prolifically, producing poems, short stories, plays, and 19 works on magic and mysticism, including the two final Holy Books of Thelema. In Paris, he met Mary Desti, who became his next &quot;Scarlet Woman&quot;, with the two undertaking magical workings in St. Moritz; Crowley believed that one of the Secret Chiefs, Ab-ul-Diz, was speaking through her. Based on Desti&#x27;s statements when in trance, Crowley wrote the two-volume &quot;Book 4&quot; (1912–13) and at the time developed the spelling &quot;magick&quot; in reference to the paranormal phenomenon as a means of distinguishing it from the stage magic of illusionists.

===Ordo Templi Orientis and the Paris Working: 1912–1914===

In early 1912, Crowley published &quot;The Book of Lies&quot;, a work of mysticism that biographer Lawrence Sutin described as &quot;his greatest success in merging his talents as poet, scholar, and magus&quot;. The German occultist Theodor Reuss later accused him of publishing some of the secrets of his own occult order, Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.), within &quot;The Book&quot;. Crowley convinced Reuss that the similarities were coincidental, and the two became friends. Reuss appointed Crowley as head of O.T.O&#x27;s British branch, the Mysteria Mystica Maxima (MMM), and at a ceremony in Berlin Crowley adopted the magical name of Baphomet and was proclaimed &quot;X° Supreme Rex and Sovereign Grand Master General of Ireland, Iona, and all the Britons&quot;. With Reuss&#x27; permission, Crowley set about advertising the MMM and re-writing many O.T.O. rituals, which were then based largely on Freemasonry; his incorporation of Thelemite elements proved controversial in the group. Fascinated by O.T.O&#x27;s emphasis on sex magic, Crowley devised a magical working based on anal sex and incorporated it into the syllabus for those O.T.O. members who were initiated into the eleventh degree.

In March 1913, Crowley acted as producer for &quot;The Ragged Ragtime Girls&quot;, a group of female violinists led by Waddell, as they performed at London&#x27;s Old Tivoli theatre. They subsequently performed in Moscow for six weeks, where Crowley had a sadomasochistic relationship with the Hungarian Anny Ringler. In Moscow, Crowley continued to write plays and poetry, including &quot;Hymn to Pan&quot;, and the Gnostic Mass, a Thelemic ritual that became a key part of O.T.O. liturgy. Churton suggested that Crowley had travelled to Moscow on the orders of British intelligence to spy on revolutionary elements in the city. In January 1914, Crowley and Neuburg settled into an apartment in Paris, where the former was involved in the controversy surrounding Jacob Epstein&#x27;s new monument to Oscar Wilde. Together Crowley and Neuburg performed the six-week &quot;Paris Working&quot;, a period of intense ritual involving strong drug use in which they invoked the gods Mercury and Jupiter. As part of the ritual, the couple performed acts of sex magic together, at times being joined by journalist Walter Duranty. Inspired by the results of the Working, Crowley wrote &quot;Liber Agapé&quot;, a treatise on sex magic. Following the Paris Working, Neuburg began to distance himself from Crowley, resulting in an argument in which Crowley cursed him.

===United States: 1914–1919===
By 1914, Crowley was living a hand-to-mouth existence, relying largely on donations from A∴A∴ members and dues payments made to O.T.O. In May, he transferred ownership of Boleskine House to the MMM for financial reasons, and in July he went mountaineering in the Swiss Alps. During this time the First World War broke out.
After recuperating from a bout of phlebitis, Crowley set sail for the United States aboard the RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot; in October 1914. Arriving in New York City, he moved into a hotel and began earning money writing for the American edition of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and undertaking freelance work for the famed astrologer Evangeline Adams. In the city, he continued experimenting with sex magic, through the use of masturbation, female prostitutes, and male clients of a Turkish bathhouse; all of these encounters were documented in his diaries.

Professing to be of Irish ancestry and a supporter of Irish independence from Great Britain, Crowley began to espouse support for Germany in their war against Britain. He became involved in New York&#x27;s pro-German movement, and in January 1915 pro-German propagandist George Sylvester Viereck employed him as a writer for his propagandist paper, &quot;The Fatherland&quot;, which was dedicated to keeping the US neutral in the conflict. In later years, detractors denounced Crowley as a traitor to Britain for this action.

Crowley entered into a relationship with Jeanne Robert Foster, with whom he toured the West Coast. In Vancouver, headquarters of the North American O.T.O., he met with Charles Stansfeld Jones and Wilfred Talbot Smith to discuss the propagation of Thelema on the continent. In Detroit he experimented with Peyote at Parke-Davis, then visited Seattle, San Francisco, Santa Cruz, Los Angeles, San Diego, Tijuana, and the Grand Canyon, before returning to New York. There he befriended Ananda Coomaraswamy and his wife Alice Richardson; Crowley and Richardson performed sex magic in April 1916, following which she became pregnant and then miscarried. Later that year he took a &quot;magical retirement&quot; to a cabin by Lake Pasquaney owned by Evangeline Adams. There, he made heavy use of drugs and undertook a ritual after which he proclaimed himself &quot;Master Therion&quot;. He also wrote several short stories based on James George Frazer&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; and a work of literary criticism, &quot;The Gospel According to Bernard Shaw&quot;.

In December, he moved to New Orleans, his favourite US city, before spending February 1917 with evangelical Christian relatives in Titusville, Florida. Returning to New York City, he moved in with artist and A∴A∴ member Leon Engers Kennedy in May, learning of his mother&#x27;s death. After the collapse of &quot;The Fatherland&quot;, Crowley continued his association with Viereck, who appointed him contributing editor of arts journal &quot;The International&quot;. Crowley used it to promote Thelema, but it soon ceased publication. He then moved to the studio apartment of Roddie Minor, who became his partner and Scarlet Woman. Through their rituals, which Crowley called &quot;The Amalantrah Workings&quot;, he believed that they were contacted by a preternatural entity named Lam. The relationship soon ended.

In 1918, Crowley went on a magical retreat in the wilderness of Esopus Island on the Hudson River. Here, he began an adaptation of the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot;, painted Thelemic slogans on the riverside cliffs, and—he later wrote—experienced past life memories of being Ge Xuan, Pope Alexander VI, Alessandro Cagliostro, and Éliphas Lévi. Back in New York City, he moved to Greenwich Village, where he took Leah Hirsig as his lover and next Scarlet Woman. He took up painting as a hobby, exhibiting his work at the Greenwich Village Liberal Club and attracting the attention of &quot;The Evening World&quot;. With the financial assistance of sympathetic Freemasons, Crowley revived &quot;The Equinox&quot; with the first issue of volume III, known as &quot;The Blue Equinox&quot;. He spent mid-1919 on a climbing holiday in Montauk before returning to London in December.

===Abbey of Thelema: 1920–1923===
Now destitute and back in London, Crowley came under attack from the tabloid &quot;John Bull&quot;, which labelled him traitorous &quot;scum&quot; for his work with the German war effort; several friends aware of his intelligence work urged him to sue, but he decided not to. When he was suffering from asthma, a doctor prescribed him heroin, to which he soon became addicted. In January 1920, he moved to Paris, renting a house in Fontainebleau with Leah Hirsig; they were soon joined in a &quot;ménage à trois&quot; by Ninette Shumway, and also (in living arrangement) by Leah&#x27;s newborn daughter Anne &quot;Poupée&quot; Leah. Crowley had ideas of forming a community of Thelemites, which he called the Abbey of Thelema after the Abbaye de Thélème in François Rabelais&#x27; satire &quot;Gargantua and Pantagruel&quot;. After consulting the &quot;I Ching&quot;, he chose Cefalù in Sicily as a location, and after arriving there, began renting the old Villa Santa Barbara as his Abbey on 2 April.
Moving to the commune with Hirsig, Shumway, and their children Hansi, Howard, and Poupée, Crowley described the scenario as &quot;perfectly happy ... my idea of heaven.&quot; They wore robes, and performed rituals to the sun god Ra at set times during the day, also occasionally performing the Gnostic Mass; the rest of the day they were left to follow their own interests. Undertaking widespread correspondences, Crowley continued to paint, wrote a commentary on &quot;The Book of the Law&quot;, and revised the third part of &quot;Book 4&quot;. He offered a libertine education for the children, allowing them to play all day and witness acts of sex magic. He occasionally travelled to Palermo to visit rent boys and buy supplies, including drugs; his heroin addiction came to dominate his life, and cocaine began to erode his nasal cavity. There was no cleaning rota, and wild dogs and cats wandered throughout the building, which soon became unsanitary. Poupée died in October 1920, and Ninette gave birth to a daughter, Astarte Lulu Panthea, soon afterwards.

New followers continued to arrive at the Abbey to be taught by Crowley. Among them was film star Jane Wolfe, who arrived in July 1920, where she was initiated into the A∴A∴ and became Crowley&#x27;s secretary. Another was Cecil Frederick Russell, who often argued with Crowley, disliking the same-sex sexual magic that he was required to perform, and left after a year. More conducive was the Australian Thelemite Frank Bennett, who also spent several months at the Abbey. In February 1922, Crowley returned to Paris for a retreat in an unsuccessful attempt to kick his heroin addiction. He then went to London in search of money, where he published articles in &quot;The English Review&quot; criticising the Dangerous Drugs Act 1920 and wrote a novel, &quot;The Diary of a Drug Fiend&quot;, completed in July. On publication, it received mixed reviews; he was lambasted by the &quot;Sunday Express&quot;, which called for its burning and used its influence to prevent further reprints.

Subsequently, a young Thelemite named Raoul Loveday moved to the Abbey with his wife Betty May; while Loveday was devoted to Crowley, May detested him and life at the commune. She later said that Loveday was made to drink the blood of a sacrificed cat, and that they were required to cut themselves with razors every time they used the pronoun &quot;I&quot;. Loveday drank from a local polluted stream, soon developing a liver infection resulting in his death in February 1923. Returning to London, May told her story to the press. &quot;John Bull&quot; proclaimed Crowley &quot;the wickedest man in the world&quot; and &quot;a man we&#x27;d like to hang&quot;, and although Crowley deemed many of their accusations against him to be slanderous, he was unable to afford the legal fees to sue them. As a result, &quot;John Bull&quot; continued its attack, with its stories being repeated in newspapers throughout Europe and in North America. The Fascist government of Benito Mussolini learned of Crowley&#x27;s activities, and in April 1923 he was given a deportation notice forcing him to leave Italy; without him, the Abbey closed.

==Later life==

===Tunisia, Paris, and London: 1923–1929===
Crowley and Hirsig went to Tunis, where, dogged by continuing poor health, he unsuccessfully tried again to give up heroin, and began writing what he termed his &quot;autohagiography&quot;, &quot;The Confessions of Aleister Crowley&quot;. They were joined in Tunis by the Thelemite Norman Mudd, who became Crowley&#x27;s public relations consultant. Employing a local boy, Mohammad ben Brahim, as his servant, Crowley went with him on a retreat to Nefta, where they performed sex magic together. In January 1924, Crowley travelled to Nice, France, where he met with Frank Harris, underwent a series of nasal operations, and visited the Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man and had a positive opinion of its founder, George Gurdjieff. Destitute, he took on a wealthy student, Alexander Zu Zolar, before taking on another American follower, Dorothy Olsen. Crowley took Olsen back to Tunisia for a magical retreat in Nefta, where he also wrote &quot;To Man&quot; (1924), a declaration of his own status as a prophet entrusted with bringing Thelema to humanity. After spending the winter in Paris, in early 1925 Crowley and Olsen returned to Tunis, where he wrote &quot;The Heart of the Master&quot; (1938) as an account of a vision he experienced in a trance. In March Olsen became pregnant, and Hirsig was called to take care of her; she miscarried, following which Crowley took Olsen back to France. Hirsig later distanced herself from Crowley, who then denounced her.

According to Crowley, Reuss named him head of O.T.O. upon his death, but this was challenged by a leader of the German O.T.O., . Tränker called the Hohenleuben Conference in Thuringia, Germany, which Crowley attended. There, prominent members like Karl Germer and Martha Küntzel championed Crowley&#x27;s leadership, but other key figures like Albin Grau, Oskar Hopfer, and Henri Birven backed Tränker by opposing it, resulting in a split in O.T.O. Moving to Paris, where he broke with Olsen in 1926, Crowley went through a large number of lovers over the following years, with whom he experimented in sex magic. Throughout, he was dogged by poor health, largely caused by his heroin and cocaine addictions. In 1928, Crowley was introduced to Israel Regardie, a young Englishman, who embraced Thelema and became Crowley&#x27;s secretary for the next three years. That year, Crowley also met Gerald Yorke, who began organising Crowley&#x27;s finances but never became a Thelemite. He also befriended the journalist Tom Driberg; Driberg did not accept Thelema either. It was here that Crowley also published one of his most significant works, &quot;Magick in Theory and Practice&quot;, which received little attention at the time.

In December 1928 Crowley met the Nicaraguan Maria Teresa Sanchez (Maria Teresa Ferrari de Miramar). Crowley was deported from France by the authorities, who disliked his reputation and feared that he was a German agent. So that she could join him in Britain, Crowley married Sanchez in August 1929. Now based in London, Mandrake Press agreed to publish his autobiography in a limited edition six-volume set, also publishing his novel &quot;Moonchild&quot; and book of short stories &quot;The Stratagem&quot;. Mandrake went into liquidation in November 1930, before the entirety of Crowley&#x27;s &quot;Confessions&quot; could be published. Mandrake&#x27;s owner P. R. Stephensen meanwhile wrote &quot;The Legend of Aleister Crowley&quot;, an analysis of the media coverage surrounding him.

===Berlin and London: 1930–1938===
In April 1930, Crowley moved to Berlin, where he took Hanni Jaegar as his magical partner; the relationship was troubled. In September he went to Lisbon in Portugal to meet the poet Fernando Pessoa. There, he decided to fake his own death, doing so with Pessoa&#x27;s help at the Boca do Inferno rock formation. He then returned to Berlin, where he reappeared three weeks later at the opening of his art exhibition at the Gallery Neumann-Nierendorf. Crowley&#x27;s paintings fitted with the fashion for German Expressionism; few of them sold, but the press reports were largely favourable. In August 1931, he took Bertha Busch as his new lover; they had a violent relationship, and often physically assaulted one another. He continued to have affairs with both men and women while in the city, and met with famous people like Aldous Huxley and Alfred Adler. After befriending him, in January 1932 he took the communist Gerald Hamilton as a lodger, through whom he was introduced to many figures within the Berlin far left; it is possible that he was operating as a spy for British intelligence at this time, monitoring the communist movement.

Crowley left Busch and returned to London, where he took Pearl Brooksmith as his new Scarlet Woman. Undergoing further nasal surgery, it was here in 1932 that he was invited to be guest of honour at Foyles&#x27; Literary Luncheon, also being invited by Harry Price to speak at the National Laboratory of Psychical Research. In need of money, he launched a series of court cases against people whom he believed to have libelled him, some of which proved successful. He gained much publicity for his lawsuit against Constable and Co for publishing Nina Hamnett&#x27;s &quot;Laughing Torso&quot; (1932)—a book he alleged libelled him by referring to his occult practice as black magic—but lost the case. The court case added to Crowley&#x27;s financial problems, and in February 1935 he was declared bankrupt. During the hearing, it was revealed that Crowley was spending three times his income for several years.

Crowley developed a friendship with Deidre Patricia Doherty; she offered to bear his child, who was born in May 1937. Named Randall Gair, Crowley nicknamed him Aleister Atatürk. He died in a car accident in 2002 at the age of 65. Crowley continued to socialize with friends, holding curry parties in which he cooked particularly spicy food for them. In 1936, he published his first book in six years, &quot;The Equinox of the Gods&quot;, which contained a facsimile of &quot;The Book of the Law&quot; and was considered to be volume III, number 3, of &quot;The Equinox&quot; periodical. The work sold well, resulting in a second print run. In 1937, he gave a series of public lectures on yoga in Soho. Crowley was now living largely off contributions supplied by O.T.O.&#x27;s Agape Lodge in California, led by rocket scientist Jack Parsons. Crowley was intrigued by the rise of Nazism in Germany, and influenced by his friend Martha Küntzel believed that Adolf Hitler might convert to Thelema; when the Nazis abolished the German O.T.O. and imprisoned Germer, who fled to the US, Crowley then lambasted Hitler as a black magician.

===Second World War and death: 1939–1947===

When the Second World War broke out, Crowley wrote to the Naval Intelligence Division offering his services, but they declined. He associated with a variety of figures in Britain&#x27;s intelligence community at the time, including Dennis Wheatley, Roald Dahl, Ian Fleming, and Maxwell Knight, and wrote that he originated the &quot;V for Victory&quot; sign first used by the BBC; this has never been proven.
In 1940, his asthma worsened, and with his German-produced medication unavailable, he returned to using heroin, once again becoming addicted. As the Blitz hit London, Crowley relocated to Torquay, where he was briefly admitted to hospital with asthma, and entertained himself with visits to the local chess club. Tiring of Torquay, he returned to London, where he was visited by American Thelemite Grady McMurtry, to whom Crowley awarded the title of &quot;Hymenaeus Alpha&quot;. He stipulated that though Germer would be his immediate successor, McMurty should succeed Germer as head of O.T.O. after the latter&#x27;s death. With O.T.O. initiate Lady Frieda Harris, Crowley developed plans to produce a tarot card set, designed by him and painted by Harris. Accompanying this was a book, published in a limited edition as &quot;The Book of Thoth&quot; by Chiswick Press in 1944. To aid the war effort, he wrote a proclamation on the rights of humanity, &quot;Liber OZ&quot;, and a poem for the liberation of France, &quot;Le Gauloise&quot;. Crowley&#x27;s final publication during his lifetime was a book of poetry, &quot;Olla: An Anthology of Sixty Years of Song&quot;. Another of his projects, &quot;Aleister Explains Everything&quot;, was posthumously published as &quot;Magick Without Tears&quot;.

In April 1944 Crowley briefly moved to Aston Clinton in Buckinghamshire, where he was visited by the poet Nancy Cunard, before relocating to Hastings in Sussex, where he took up residence at the Netherwood boarding house. He took a young man named Kenneth Grant as his secretary, paying him in magical teaching rather than wages. He was also introduced to John Symonds, whom he appointed to be his literary executor; Symonds thought little of Crowley, later publishing unfavorable biographies of him. Corresponding with the illusionist Arnold Crowther, it was through him that Crowley was introduced to Gerald Gardner, the future founder of Gardnerian Wicca. They became friends, with Crowley authorising Gardner to revive Britain&#x27;s ailing O.T.O. Another visitor was Eliza Marian Butler, who interviewed Crowley for her book &quot;The Myth of the Magus&quot;. Other friends and family also spent time with him, among them Doherty and Crowley&#x27;s son Aleister Atatürk.

On 1 December 1947, Crowley died at Netherwood of chronic bronchitis aggravated by pleurisy and myocardial degeneration, aged 72. His funeral was held at a Brighton crematorium on 5 December; about a dozen people attended, and Louis Wilkinson read excerpts from the Gnostic Mass, &quot;The Book of the Law&quot;, and &quot;Hymn to Pan&quot;. The funeral generated press controversy, and was labelled a Black Mass by the tabloids. Crowley&#x27;s body was cremated; his ashes were sent to Karl Germer in the US, who buried them in his garden in Hampton, New Jersey.

==Beliefs and thought==


Crowley&#x27;s belief system, Thelema, has been described by scholars as a religion, and more specifically as both a new religious movement, and as a &quot;magico-religious doctrine&quot;. Although holding &quot;The Book of the Law&quot;—which was composed in 1904—as its central text, Thelema took shape as a complete system in the years after 1904.

In his autobiography, Crowley wrote that his purpose in life was to &quot;bring oriental wisdom to Europe and to restore paganism in a purer form&quot;, although what he meant by &quot;paganism&quot; was unclear. Crowley also wrote in the 4th Book of Magick about a great pagan Umbral fleet ruled by Ottovius that would be handed down to the great Spartan. The esoteric nature of this was also unclear. Crowley&#x27;s thought was not always cohesive, and was influenced by a variety of sources, ranging from eastern religious movements and practices like Hindu yoga and Buddhism, scientific naturalism, and various currents within Western esotericism, among them ceremonial magic, alchemy, astrology, Rosicrucianism, Kabbalah, and the Tarot. He was steeped in the esoteric teachings he had learned from the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, although pushed further with his own interpretations and strategies than the Golden Dawn had done. Crowley incorporated concepts and terminology from South Asian religious traditions like yoga and Tantra into his Thelemic system, believing that there was a fundamental underlying resemblance between Western and Eastern spiritual systems. The historian Alex Owen noted that Crowley adhered to the &quot;modus operandi&quot; of the Decadent movement throughout his life.

Crowley believed that the twentieth century marked humanity&#x27;s entry to the Aeon of Horus, a new era in which humans would take increasing control of their destiny. He believed that this Aeon follows on from the Aeon of Osiris, in which paternalistic religions like Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism dominated the world, and that this in turn had followed the Aeon of Isis, which was maternalistic and dominated by goddess worship. He believed that Thelema was the proper religion of the Aeon of Horus, and also deemed himself to be the prophet of this new Aeon. Thelema revolves around the idea that human beings each have their own True Will that they should discover and pursue, and that this exists in harmony with the Cosmic Will that pervades the universe. Crowley referred to this process of searching and discovery of one&#x27;s True Will to be &quot;the Great Work&quot; or the attaining of the &quot;knowledge and conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel&quot;. His favoured method of doing so was through the performance of the Abramelin operation, a ceremonial magic ritual obtained from a 17th-century grimoire. The moral code of &quot;Do What Thou Wilt&quot; is believed by Thelemites to be the religion&#x27;s ethical law, although the historian of religion Marco Pasi noted that this was not anarchistic or libertarian in structure, as Crowley saw individuals as part of a wider societal organism.

===Magick and theology===
Crowley believed in the objective existence of magic, which he chose to spell as &quot;Magick&quot;, which is an archaic spelling of the word. He provided various different definitions of this term over his career. In his book &quot;Magick in Theory and Practice&quot;, Crowley defined Magick as &quot;the Science and Art of causing change to occur in conformity with Will&quot;. He also told his disciple Karl Germer that &quot;Magick is getting into communication with individuals who exist on a higher plane than ours. Mysticism is the raising of oneself to their level.&quot; Crowley saw Magick as a third way between religion and science, giving &quot;The Equinox&quot; the subtitle of &quot;The Method of Science; the Aim of Religion&quot;. Within that journal, he expressed positive sentiments toward science and the scientific method, and urged magicians to keep detailed records of their magical experiments, having said: &quot;The more scientific the record is, the better.&quot; His understanding of magic was also influenced by the work of the anthropologist James Frazer, in particular the belief that magic was a precursor to science in a cultural evolutionary framework. Unlike Frazer, however, Crowley did not see magic as a survival from the past that required eradication, but rather he believed that magic had to be adapted to suit the new age of science. In Crowley&#x27;s alternative schema, old systems of &quot;magic&quot; had to decline (per Frazer&#x27;s framework) so that science and magic could synthesize into &quot;magick&quot;, which would simultaneously accept the existence of the supernatural and an experimental method. Crowley deliberately adopted an exceptionally broad definition of magick that included almost all forms of technology as magick, adopting an instrumentalist definition of magic, science, and technology.

Sexuality played an important role in Crowley&#x27;s ideas about magick and his practice of it, and has been described as being central to Thelema. He outlined three forms of sex magick—the autoerotic, homosexual, and heterosexual—and argued that such acts could be used to focus the magician&#x27;s will onto a specific goal such as financial gain or personal creative success. For Crowley, sex was treated as a sacrament, with the consumption of sexual fluids interpreted as a Eucharist. This was often manifested as the Cakes of Light, a biscuit containing either menstrual blood or a mixture of semen and vaginal fluids. The Gnostic Mass is the central religious ceremony within Thelema.

Crowley&#x27;s theological beliefs were not clear. The historian Ronald Hutton noted that some of Crowley&#x27;s writings could be used to argue that he was an atheist, while some support the idea that he was a polytheist, and others would bolster the idea that he was a mystical monotheist. On the basis of the teachings in &quot;The Book of the Law&quot;, Crowley described a pantheon of three deities taken from the ancient Egyptian pantheon: Nuit, Hadit, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit. In 1928, he wrote that all true deities were derived from this trinity. Jason Josephson Storm has argued that Crowley built on 19th-century attempts to link early Christianity to pre-Christian religions, such as Frazer&#x27;s &quot;Golden Bough&quot;, to synthesize Christian theology and Neopaganism while remaining critical of institutional and traditional Christianity.

Both during his life and after it, Crowley has been widely described as a Satanist, usually by detractors. Crowley stated he did not consider himself a Satanist, nor did he worship Satan, as he did not accept the Christian world view in which Satan was believed to exist. He nevertheless used Satanic imagery, for instance by describing himself as &quot;the Beast 666&quot; and referring to the Whore of Babylon in his work, while in later life he sent &quot;Antichristmas cards&quot; to his friends. In his writings, Crowley occasionally identified Aiwass as Satan and designated him as &quot;Our Lord God the Devil&quot; at one occasion. The scholar of religion Gordan Djurdjevic stated that Crowley &quot;was emphatically not&quot; a Satanist, &quot;if for no other reason than simply because he did not identify himself as such&quot;. Crowley nevertheless expressed strong anti-Christian sentiment, stating that he hated Christianity &quot;as Socialists hate soap&quot;, an animosity probably stemming from his experiences among the Plymouth Brethren. He was nevertheless influenced by the King James Bible, especially the Book of Revelation, the impact of which can be seen in his writings. He was also accused of advocating human sacrifice, largely because of a passage in &quot;Book 4&quot; in which he stated that &quot;A male child of perfect innocence and high intelligence is the most satisfactory victim&quot; and added that he had sacrificed about 150 every year. This was a tongue-in-cheek reference to ejaculation, something not realized by his critics.

==Image and opinions==
Crowley considered himself to be one of the outstanding figures of his time. The historian Ronald Hutton stated that in Crowley&#x27;s youth, he was &quot;a self-indulgent and flamboyant young man&quot; who &quot;set about a deliberate flouting and provocation of social and religious norms&quot;, while being shielded from an &quot;outraged public opinion&quot; by his inherited wealth. Hutton also described Crowley as having both an &quot;unappeasable desire&quot; to take control of any organisation that he belonged to, and &quot;a tendency to quarrel savagely&quot; with those who challenged him. Crowley biographer Martin Booth asserted that Crowley was &quot;self-confident, brash, eccentric, egotistic, highly intelligent, arrogant, witty, wealthy, and, when it suited him, cruel&quot;. Similarly, Richard B. Spence noted that Crowley was &quot;capable of immense physical and emotional cruelty&quot;. Biographer Lawrence Sutin noted that Crowley exhibited &quot;courage, skill, dauntless energy, and remarkable focus of will&quot; while at the same time showing a &quot;blind arrogance, petty fits of bile, [and] contempt for the abilities of his fellow men&quot;. The Thelemite Lon Milo DuQuette noted that Crowley &quot;was by no means perfect&quot; and &quot;often alienated those who loved him dearest.&quot;

===Political opinions===
Crowley enjoyed being outrageous and flouting conventional morality, with John Symonds noting that he &quot;was in revolt against the moral and religious values of his time&quot;. Crowley&#x27;s political thought was studied by the academic Marco Pasi, who noted that for Crowley, socio-political concerns were subordinate to metaphysical and spiritual ones. He was neither on the political left nor right but perhaps best categorized as a &quot;conservative revolutionary&quot; despite not being affiliated with the German-based movement of the same name. Pasi described Crowley&#x27;s fascination with the extreme ideologies of Nazism and Marxism–Leninism, which aimed to violently overturn society: &quot;What Crowley liked about Nazism and communism, or at least what made him curious about them, was the anti-Christian position and the revolutionary and socially subversive implications of these two movements. In their subversive powers, he saw the possibility of an annihilation of old religious traditions, and the creation of a void that Thelema, subsequently, would be able to fill.&quot; Crowley described democracy as an &quot;imbecile and nauseating cult of weakness&quot;, and commented that &quot;The Book of the Law&quot; proclaimed that &quot;there is the master and there is the slave; the noble and the serf; the &#x27;lone wolf&#x27; and the herd&quot;. In this attitude, he was influenced by Social Darwinism and the work of Friedrich Nietzsche. Although he had contempt for most of the British aristocracy, he regarded himself as an aristocrat and styled himself as Laird Boleskine, once describing his ideology as &quot;aristocratic communism&quot;.

===Opinions on race and gender===
Crowley was bisexual, but exhibited a preference for women, with his relationships with men being fewer and mostly in the early part of his life. In particular he was attracted to &quot;exotic women&quot;, and said he had fallen in love on multiple occasions; Kaczynski stated that &quot;when he loved, he did so with his whole being, but the passion was typically short-lived&quot;. Even in later life, Crowley was able to attract young bohemian women to be his lovers, largely due to his charisma. He applied the term &quot;Scarlet Woman&quot; to various female lovers whom he believed played an important role in his magical work. During homosexual acts, he usually played &#x27;the passive role&#x27;, which Booth believed &quot;appealed to his masochistic side&quot;. An underlying theme in many of his writings is that spiritual enlightenment arises through transgressing socio-sexual norms.

Crowley advocated complete sexual freedom for both men and women. He argued that homosexual and bisexual people should not suppress their sexual orientation, commenting that a person &quot;must not be ashamed or afraid of being homosexual if he happens to be so at heart; he must not attempt to violate his own true nature because of public opinion, or medieval morality, or religious prejudice which would wish he were otherwise.&quot; On other issues he adopted a more conservative attitude; he opposed abortion on moral grounds, believing that no woman following her True Will would ever desire one.

Biographer Lawrence Sutin stated that &quot;blatant bigotry is a persistent minor element in Crowley&#x27;s writings&quot;. Sutin thought Crowley &quot;a spoiled scion of a wealthy Victorian family who embodied many of the worst John Bull racial and social prejudices of his upper-class contemporaries&quot;, noting that he &quot;embodied the contradiction that writhed within many Western intellectuals of the time: deeply held racist viewpoints courtesy of society, coupled with a fascination with people of colour&quot;. Crowley is said to have insulted his close Jewish friend Victor Neuburg, using antisemitic slurs, and he had mixed opinions about Jewish people as a group. Although he praised their &quot;sublime&quot; poetry and stated that they exhibited &quot;imagination, romance, loyalty, probity and humanity&quot;, he also thought that centuries of persecution had led some Jewish people to exhibit &quot;avarice, servility, falseness, cunning and the rest&quot;. He was also known to praise various ethnic and cultural groups, for instance he thought that the Chinese people exhibited a &quot;spiritual superiority&quot; to the English, and praised Muslims for exhibiting &quot;manliness, straightforwardness, subtlety, and self-respect&quot;.

Both critics of Crowley and adherents of Thelema have accused Crowley of sexism. Booth described Crowley as exhibiting a &quot;general misogyny&quot;, something the biographer believed arose from Crowley&#x27;s bad relationship with his mother. Sutin noted that Crowley &quot;largely accepted the notion, implicitly embodied in Victorian sexology, of women as secondary social beings in terms of intellect and sensibility&quot;. The scholar of religion Manon Hedenborg White noted that some of Crowley&#x27;s statements are &quot;undoubtedly misogynist by contemporary standards&quot;, but characterized Crowley&#x27;s attitude toward women as complex and multi-faceted. Crowley&#x27;s comments on women&#x27;s role varied dramatically within his written work, even that produced in similar periods. Crowley described women as &quot;moral inferiors&quot; who had to be treated with &quot;firmness, kindness and justice&quot;, while also arguing that Thelema was essential to women&#x27;s emancipation.

==Possible links to intelligence==
Biographers Richard B. Spence and Tobias Churton have suggested that Crowley was a spy for the British secret services and that among other things he joined the Golden Dawn under their command to monitor the activities of Mathers, who was known to be a Carlist. Spence suggested that the conflict between Mathers and the London lodge for the temple was part of an intelligence operation to undermine Mathers&#x27; authority. Spence has suggested that the purpose of Crowley&#x27;s trip to Mexico might have been to explore Mexican oil prospects for British intelligence. Spence has suggested that his trip to China was orchestrated as part of a British intelligence scheme to monitor the region&#x27;s opium trade. Churton suggested that Crowley had travelled to Moscow on the orders of British intelligence to spy on revolutionary elements in the city.

Spence and Sutin both wrote that Crowley&#x27;s pro-German work in the United States during World War I was actually a cover for him being a double agent for Britain, citing his hyperbolic articles in &quot;The Fatherland&quot; to make the German lobby appear ridiculous in the eyes of the American public. Spence also wrote that Crowley encouraged the German Navy to destroy the &quot;Lusitania&quot;, informing them that it would ensure the US stayed out of the war, while in reality hoping that it would bring the US into the war on Britain&#x27;s side.

==Legacy and influence==
Crowley has remained an influential figure, both amongst occultists and in popular culture, particularly that of Britain, but also of other parts of the world. In 2002, a BBC poll placed Crowley seventy-third in a list of the 100 Greatest Britons. Richard Cavendish has written of him that &quot;In native talent, penetrating intelligence and determination, Aleister Crowley was the best-equipped magician to emerge since the seventeenth century.&quot; The scholar of esotericism Egil Asprem described him as &quot;one of the most well-known figures in modern occultism&quot;. The scholar of esotericism Wouter Hanegraaff asserted that Crowley was an extreme representation of &quot;the dark side of the occult&quot;, adding that he was &quot;the most notorious occultist magician of the twentieth century&quot;. The philosopher John Moore opined that Crowley stood out as a &quot;Modern Master&quot; when compared with other prominent occult figures like George Gurdjieff, P. D. Ouspensky, Rudolf Steiner, or Helena Blavatsky, also describing him as a &quot;living embodiment&quot; of Oswald Spengler&#x27;s &quot;Faustian Man&quot;. Biographer Tobias Churton considered Crowley &quot;a pioneer of consciousness research&quot;. Hutton noted that Crowley had &quot;an important place in the history of modern Western responses to Oriental spiritual traditions&quot;, while Sutin thought that he had made &quot;distinctly original contributions&quot; to the study of yoga in the West.

Thelema continued to develop and spread following Crowley&#x27;s death. In 1969, O.T.O. was reactivated in California under the leadership of Grady Louis McMurtry; in 1985 its right to the title was unsuccessfully challenged in court by a rival group, the Society Ordo Templi Orientis, led by Brazilian Thelemite Marcelo Ramos Motta. Another American Thelemite is the filmmaker Kenneth Anger, who was influenced by Crowley&#x27;s writings from a young age. In the United Kingdom, Kenneth Grant propagated a tradition known as Typhonian Thelema through his organisation, the Typhonian O.T.O., later renamed the Typhonian Order. Also in Britain, an occultist known as Amado Crowley claimed to be Crowley&#x27;s son; this has been refuted by academic investigation. Amado argued that Thelema was a false religion created by Crowley to hide his true esoteric teachings, which Amado said he was propagating.

Several Western esoteric traditions other than Thelema were also influenced by Crowley, with Djurdjevic observing that &quot;Crowley&#x27;s influence on twentieth-century and contemporary esotericism has been enormous&quot;. Gerald Gardner, the founder of Gardnerian Wicca, used much of Crowley&#x27;s published material when composing the Gardnerian ritual liturgy, and the Australian witch Rosaleen Norton was also heavily influenced by Crowley&#x27;s ideas. More widely, Crowley became &quot;a dominant figure&quot; in the modern Pagan community. L. Ron Hubbard, the American founder of Scientology, was involved in Thelema in the early 1940s (with Jack Parsons), and it has been argued that Crowley&#x27;s ideas influenced some of Hubbard&#x27;s work. The scholars of religion Asbjørn Dyrendel, James R. Lewis, and Jesper Petersen noted that despite the fact that Crowley was not a Satanist, he &quot;in many ways embodies the pre-Satanist esoteric discourse on Satan and Satanism through his lifestyle and his philosophy&quot;, with his &quot;image and ought&quot; becoming an &quot;important influence&quot; on the later development of religious Satanism. For instance, two prominent figures in religious Satanism, Anton LaVey and Michael Aquino, were influenced by Crowley&#x27;s work.

=== In popular culture ===
Crowley also had a wider influence in British popular culture. After his time in Cefalù, which brought him to public attention in Britain, various &quot;literary Crowleys&quot; appeared: characters in fiction based upon him. One of the earliest was the character of the poet Shelley Arabin in John Buchan&#x27;s 1926 novel &quot;The Dancing Floor&quot;. In his novel &quot;The Devil Rides Out&quot;, the writer Dennis Wheatley used Crowley as a partial basis for the character of Damien Mocata, a portly bald defrocked priest who engages in black magic. The occultist Dion Fortune used Crowley as a basis for characters in her books &quot;The Secrets of Doctor Taverner&quot; (1926) and &quot;The Winged Bull&quot; (1935). He was included as one of the figures on the cover art of The Beatles&#x27; album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; (1967), and his motto of &quot;Do What Thou Wilt&quot; was inscribed on the vinyl of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s album &quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot; (1970). Led Zeppelin co-founder Jimmy Page bought Boleskine in 1971, and part of the band&#x27;s film &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot; was filmed in the grounds. He sold it in 1992. Though David Bowie makes but a fleeting reference to Crowley in the lyrics of his song &quot;Quicksand&quot; (1971), it has been suggested that the lyrics of Bowie&#x27;s No. 1 hit single &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; (1983) may substantially paraphrase Crowley&#x27;s 1923 poem &quot;Lyric of Love to Leah&quot;. Ozzy Osbourne and his lyricist Bob Daisley wrote a song titled &quot;Mr. Crowley&quot; (1980). A prophetic quote about the coming of the New Aeon borrowed from Crowley&#x27;s work &quot;Magick in Theory and Practice&quot; (1911) has been featured as the opening introduction to the video game &quot;Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain&quot; (1996). Crowley began to receive scholarly attention from academics in the late 1990s.

<text>The afterlife or life after death is a purported existence in which the essential part of an individual&#x27;s stream of consciousness or identity continues to exist after the death of their physical body. The surviving essential aspect varies between belief systems; it may be some partial element, or the entire soul or spirit, which carries with it one&#x27;s personal identity.

In some views, this continued existence takes place in a spiritual realm, while in others, the individual may be reborn into this world and begin the life cycle over again in a process referred to as reincarnation, likely with no memory of what they have done in the past. In this latter view, such rebirths and deaths may take place over and over again continuously until the individual gains entry to a spiritual realm or otherworld. Major views on the afterlife derive from religion, esotericism, and metaphysics.

Some belief systems, such as those in the Abrahamic tradition, hold that the dead go to a specific place (e.g., paradise or hell) after death, as determined by their god, based on their actions and beliefs during life. In contrast, in systems of reincarnation, such as those of the Indian religions, the nature of the continued existence is determined directly by the actions of the individual in the ended life.
==Different metaphysical models==
Theist immortalists generally believe some afterlife awaits people when they die. Members of some generally non-theistic religions believe in an afterlife without reference to a deity.

Religions, such as Christianity, Islam, and various pagan belief systems, believe in the soul&#x27;s existence in another world, while others, like many forms of Hinduism and Buddhism, believe in reincarnation. In both cases, these religions hold that one&#x27;s status in the afterlife is determined by their conduct during life.

===Reincarnation===
Reincarnation is the philosophical or religious concept that an aspect of a living being starts a new life in a different physical body or form after each death. This concept is also known as rebirth or transmigration and is part of the Saṃsāra/karma doctrine of cyclic existence. Samsara refers to the process in which souls (jivas) go through a sequence of human and animal forms. Traditional Hinduism teaches that each life helps the soul (jivas) learn until the soul becomes purified to the point of liberation. All major Indian religions, namely Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism, and Sikhism have their own interpretations of the idea of reincarnation. The human idea of reincarnation is found in many diverse ancient cultures, and a belief in rebirth/metempsychosis was held by historic Greek figures, such as Pythagoras and Plato. It is a common belief of various ancient and modern religions, such as Spiritism, theosophy, and Eckankar. It is found as well in many tribal societies around the world, in places such as Australia, East Asia, Siberia, and South America.

Although the majority of denominations within the Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam do not believe that individuals reincarnate, particular groups within these religions do refer to reincarnation; these groups include the mainstream historical and contemporary followers of Kabbalah, the Cathars, Alawites, the Druze, and the Rosicrucians. The historical relations between these sects and the beliefs about reincarnation that were characteristic of neoplatonism, Orphism, Hermeticism, Manicheanism, and Gnosticism of the Roman era as well as the Indian religions have been the subject of scholarly research. Unity Church and its founder Charles Fillmore teach reincarnation.

Rosicrucians speak of a life review period occurring immediately after death and before entering the afterlife&#x27;s planes of existence (before the silver cord is broken), followed by a judgment, more akin to a final review or end report over one&#x27;s life.

===Heaven and Hell===

Heaven, the heavens, Seven Heavens, pure lands, Tian, Jannah, Valhalla, or the Summerland, is a common religious, cosmological, or transcendent place where beings such as gods, angels, jinn, saints, or venerated ancestors are said to originate, be enthroned, or live. According to the beliefs of some religions, heavenly beings can descend to earth or incarnate, and earthly beings can ascend to heaven in the afterlife, or in exceptional cases, enter heaven alive.

Heaven is often described as a &quot;higher place&quot;, the holiest place, a paradise, in contrast to hell or the underworld or the &quot;low places&quot;, and universally or conditionally accessible by earthly beings according to various standards of divinity, goodness, piety, faith or other virtues or right beliefs or the will of God. Some believe in the possibility of a heaven on Earth in a world to come.

In Hinduism, heaven is termed &quot;Svarga loka&quot;. There are seven positive regions and seven negative regions to which the soul can go after death. After completing its stay in the respective region, the soul is subjected to rebirth in different living forms according to its &quot;karma&quot;. This cycle can be broken after a soul achieves &quot;Moksha&quot; or &quot;Nirvana&quot;. Any place of existence, either of humans, souls or deities, outside the tangible world (heaven, hell, or other) is referred to as otherworld.

Hell, in many religious and folkloric traditions, is a place of torment and punishment in the afterlife. Religions with a linear divine history often depict hell as an eternal destination, while religions with a cyclic history often depict a hell as an intermediary period between incarnations. Typically, these traditions locate hell in another dimension or under the Earth&#x27;s surface and often include entrances to hell from the land of the living. Other afterlife destinations include purgatory and limbo.

Traditions that do not conceive of the afterlife as a place of punishment or reward merely describe hell as an abode of the dead, the grave, a neutral place (for example, Sheol or Hades) located under the surface of Earth.

==Ancient religions==
===Ancient Egyptian religion===


The afterlife played an important role in Ancient Egyptian religion, and its belief system is one of the earliest known in recorded history. When the body died, parts of its soul known as &quot;ka&quot; (body double) and the &quot;ba&quot; (personality) would go to the Kingdom of the Dead. While the soul dwelt in the Fields of Aaru, Osiris demanded work as restitution for the protection he provided. Statues were placed in the tombs to serve as substitutes for the deceased.

Arriving at one&#x27;s reward in afterlife was a demanding ordeal, requiring a sin-free heart and the ability to recite the spells, passwords, and formulae of the Book of the Dead. In the Hall of Two Truths, the deceased&#x27;s heart was weighed against the &quot;Shu&quot; feather of truth and justice taken from the headdress of the goddess Ma&#x27;at. If the heart was lighter than the feather, they could pass on, but if it were heavier they would be devoured by the demon Ammit.

Egyptians also believed that being mummified and put in a sarcophagus (an ancient Egyptian &quot;coffin&quot; carved with complex symbols and designs, as well as pictures and hieroglyphs) was the only way to have an afterlife. What are referred to as the Coffin Texts, are inscribed on a coffin and serve as a guide for the challenges in the afterlife. The Coffin texts are more or less a duplication of the Pyramid Texts, which would serve as a guide for Egyptian pharaohs or queens in the afterlife. Only if the corpse had been properly embalmed and entombed in a mastaba, could the dead live again in the Fields of Yalu and accompany the Sun on its daily ride. Due to the dangers the afterlife posed, the Book of the Dead was placed in the tomb with the body as well as food, jewelry, and &#x27;curses&#x27;. They also used the &quot;opening of the mouth&quot;.

Ancient Egyptian civilization was based on religion. The belief in the rebirth after death became the driving force behind funeral practices; for them, death was a temporary interruption rather than complete cessation of life. Eternal life could be ensured by means like piety to the gods, preservation of the physical form through mummification, and the provision of statuary and other funerary equipment. Each human consisted of the physical body, the &quot;ka&quot;, the &quot;ba&quot;, and the &quot;akh&quot;. The Name and Shadow were also living entities. To enjoy the afterlife, all these elements had to be sustained and protected from harm.

On 30 March 2010, a spokesman for the Egyptian Culture Ministry claimed it had unearthed a large red granite door in Luxor with inscriptions by User, a powerful adviser to the 18th Dynasty Queen Hatshepsut who ruled between 1479 BC and 1458 BC, the longest of any woman. It believes the false door is a &#x27;door to the Afterlife&#x27;. According to the archaeologists, the door was reused in a structure in Roman Egypt.

===Ancient Greek and Roman religions===

The Greek god Hades is known in Greek mythology as the king of the underworld, a place where souls live after death. The Greek god Hermes, the messenger of the gods, would take the dead soul of a person to the underworld (sometimes called Hades or the House of Hades). Hermes would leave the soul on the banks of the River Styx, the river between life and death.

Charon, also known as the ferry-man, would take the soul across the river to Hades, if the soul had gold: upon burial, the family of the dead soul would put coins under the deceased&#x27;s tongue. Once crossed, the soul would be judged by Aeacus, Rhadamanthus and King Minos. The soul would be sent to Elysium, Tartarus, or Asphodel Fields. The Elysian Fields were for the ones that lived pure lives. It consisted of green fields, valleys and mountains, everyone there was peaceful and contented, and the Sun always shone there. Tartarus was for the people that blasphemed against the gods or were rebellious and consciously evil. In Tartarus, the soul would be punished by being burned in lava or stretched on racks. The Asphodel Fields were for a varied selection of human souls including those whose sins equaled their goodness, those who were indecisive in their lives, and those who were not judged.

Some heroes of Greek legend are allowed to visit the underworld. The Romans had a similar belief system about the afterlife, with Hades becoming known as Pluto. In the ancient Greek myth about the Labours of Heracles, the hero Heracles had to travel to the underworld to capture Cerberus, the three-headed guard dog, as one of his tasks.

In &quot;Dream of Scipio&quot;, Cicero describes what seems to be an out of body experience, of the soul traveling high above the Earth, looking down at the small planet, from far away.

In Book VI of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, the hero, Aeneas, travels to the underworld to see his father. By the River Styx, he sees the souls of those not given a proper burial, forced to wait by the river until someone buries them. While down there, along with the dead, he is shown the place where the wrongly convicted reside, the fields of sorrow where those who committed suicide and now regret it reside, including Aeneas&#x27; former lover, the warriors and shades, Tartarus (where the titans and powerful non-mortal enemies of the Olympians reside) where he can hear the groans of the imprisoned, the palace of Pluto, and the fields of Elysium where the descendants of the divine and bravest heroes reside. He sees the river of forgetfulness, Lethe, which the dead must drink to forget their life and begin anew. Lastly, his father shows him all of the future heroes of Rome who will live if Aeneas fulfills his destiny in founding the city.

Other eschatological views populate the ancient-Greek worldview. For instance, Plato argued for reincarnation in several dialogues, including the &quot;Timaeus&quot;.

===Norse religion===
The Poetic and Prose Eddas, the oldest sources for information on the Norse concept of the afterlife, vary in their description of the several realms that are described as falling under this topic. The most well-known are:
* Valhalla: (lit. &quot;Hall of the Slain&quot; i.e. &quot;the Chosen Ones&quot;) Half the warriors who die in battle join the god Odin who rules over a majestic hall called Valhalla in Asgard.
* Fólkvangr: (lit. &quot;Field of the Host&quot;) The other half join the goddess Freyja in a great meadow known as Fólkvangr.
* Niflhel: (lit. &quot;The Dark&quot; or &quot;Misty Hel&quot;). Niflhel is believed to be a place of punishment, where the oathbreakers and other wicked people go.
* Hel: (lit. &quot;The Covered Hall&quot;). Hel was the daughter of god Loki and her kingdom was located in downward and northward. Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; tells of evil men going to Niflhel via Hel.

==Abrahamic religions==

===Judaism===
====Sheol====
Sheol, in the Hebrew Bible, is a place of darkness (Job 10:21–22) to which all the dead go—both the righteous and the unrighteous—regardless of the moral choices made in life (Genesis 35:37; Book of Ezekiel 32; Isaiah 16; Job 30:23), a place of stillness (Psalm 88:13, 94:17; Ecclesiastes 9:10), at the longest possible distance from Heaven (Job 11:8; Amos 9:2; Psalm 139:8).

The inhabitants of Sheol were the &quot;shades&quot; (&quot;rephaim&quot;), entities without personality or strength. Under some circumstances, they were thought to be able to be contacted by the living (as the Witch of Endor contacts the shade of Samuel for Saul), but such practices were forbidden (Deuteronomy 18:10).

Whereas the Hebrew Bible appears to describe Sheol as the permanent place of the dead, in the Second Temple period (roughly 500 BC – 70 AD), a more diverse set of ideas developed. In some texts, Sheol is considered to be the home of both the righteous and the wicked, separated into respective compartments; in others, it was considered a place of punishment, meant for the wicked dead alone. When the Hebrew scriptures were translated into Greek in ancient Alexandria around 200 BC, the word &quot;Hades&quot; (the Greek underworld) was substituted for Sheol. This is reflected in the New Testament where Hades is both the underworld of the dead and the personification of the evil it represents.

====World to Come====
The Talmud offers several thoughts relating to the afterlife. After death, the soul is brought for judgment. Those who have led pristine lives immediately enter the &quot;Olam Haba&quot; or world to come. Most do not enter the world to come immediately but experience a period of reflection on their earthly actions and are made aware of what they have done wrong. Some view this period as &quot;re-schooling&quot;, with the soul gaining wisdom as one&#x27;s errors are reviewed. Others view this period as spiritual discomfort caused by past wrongs. At the end of this period, not longer than one year, the soul then takes its place in the world to come. Although discomforts are made part of certain Jewish conceptions of the afterlife, the concept of eternal damnation is not a tenet of the Jewish afterlife. According to the Talmud, extinction of the soul is reserved for a far smaller group of malicious and evil leaders whose very evil deeds go way beyond norms or who lead large groups of people to utmost evil. This is also part of Maimonides&#x27; 13 principles of faith.

Maimonides describes the &quot;Olam Haba&quot; in spiritual terms, relegating the prophesied physical resurrection to the status of a future miracle unrelated to the afterlife or the Messianic era. According to Maimonides, an afterlife continues for the soul of every human being: soul now separated from the body in which it was &quot;housed&quot; during its earthly existence.

The Zohar describes Gehenna not as a place of punishment for the wicked but as a place of spiritual purification for souls.

====Reincarnation in Jewish tradition====
Although there is no reference to reincarnation in the Talmud or any prior writings, according to rabbis such as Avraham Arieh Trugman, reincarnation is recognized as being part and parcel of Jewish tradition. Trugman explains that it is through oral tradition that the meanings of the Torah, its commandments, and stories are known and understood. The classic work of Jewish mysticism, the Zohar, is quoted liberally in all Jewish learning; in the Zohar, the idea of reincarnation is mentioned repeatedly. Trugman states that in the last five centuries, the concept of reincarnation, which until then had been a much-hidden tradition within Judaism, was given open exposure.

Shraga Simmons commented that within the Bible itself, the idea [of reincarnation] is intimated in Deut. 25:5–10, Deut. 33:6 and Isaiah 22:14, 65:6.

Yirmiyahu Ullman wrote that reincarnation is an &quot;ancient, mainstream belief in Judaism&quot;. The Zohar makes frequent and lengthy references to reincarnation. Onkelos, a righteous convert and authoritative commentator of the same period, explained the verse, &quot;Let Reuben live and not die ...&quot; (Deuteronomy 33:6) to mean that Reuben should merit the World to Come directly and not have to die again as a result of being reincarnated. Torah scholar, commentator and kabbalist, Nachmanides (Ramban 1195–1270), attributed Job&#x27;s suffering to reincarnation, as hinted in Job&#x27;s saying &quot;God does all these things twice or three times with a man, to bring back his soul from the pit to... the light of the living&#x27; (Job 33:29–30).&quot;

Reincarnation, called &quot;gilgul&quot;, became popular in folk belief and is found in much Yiddish literature among Ashkenazi Jews. Among a few kabbalists, it was posited that some human souls could end up being reincarnated into non-human bodies. These ideas were found in several Kabbalistic works from the 13th century and among many mystics in the late 16th century. Martin Buber&#x27;s early collection of stories of the Baal Shem Tov&#x27;s life includes several that refer to people reincarnating in successive lives.

Among well-known (generally non-kabbalist or anti-kabbalist) rabbis who rejected the idea of reincarnation are Saadia Gaon, David Kimhi, Hasdai Crescas, Yedayah Bedershi (early 14th century), Joseph Albo, Abraham ibn Daud, the Rosh and Leon de Modena. Saadia Gaon, in Emunoth ve-Deoth (Hebrew: &quot;beliefs and opinions&quot;), concludes Section VI with a refutation of the doctrine of metempsychosis (reincarnation). While rebutting reincarnation, Saadia Gaon further states that Jews who hold to reincarnation have adopted non-Jewish beliefs. By no means do all Jews today believe in reincarnation, but belief in reincarnation is not uncommon among many Jews, including Orthodox.

Other well-known rabbis who are reincarnationists include Yonassan Gershom, Abraham Isaac Kook, Talmud scholar Adin Steinsaltz, DovBer Pinson, David M. Wexelman, Zalman Schachter, and many others. Reincarnation is cited by authoritative Biblical commentators, including Ramban (Nachmanides), Menachem Recanti, and Rabbenu Bachya.

Among the many volumes of Yitzchak Luria, most of which come down from the pen of his primary disciple, Chaim Vital, are insights explaining issues related to reincarnation. His &quot;Shaar HaGilgulim&quot; (&quot;The Gates of Reincarnation&quot;) is a book devoted exclusively to the subject of reincarnation in Judaism.

Rabbi Naftali Silberberg of The Rohr Jewish Learning Institute notes that &quot;Many ideas that originate in other religions and belief systems have been popularized in the media and are taken for granted by unassuming Jews.&quot;

===Christianity===

Mainstream Christianity professes belief in the Nicene Creed, and English versions of the Nicene Creed in current use include the phrase: &quot;We look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come.&quot;

When questioned by the Sadducees about the resurrection of the dead (in a context relating to who one&#x27;s spouse would be if one had been married several times in life), Jesus said that marriage would be irrelevant after the resurrection as the resurrected will be like the angels in Heaven.

Jesus also maintained that the time would come when the dead would hear the voice of the Son of God, and all who were in the tombs would come out; those who have heard his &quot;[commandments] and believes in the one who sent [Him]&quot; to the &quot;resurrection of life&quot;, but those who do not to the &quot;resurrection of condemnation&quot;.

The Book of Enoch describes Sheol as divided into four compartments for four types of the dead: the faithful saints who await resurrection in Paradise, the merely virtuous who await their reward, the wicked who await punishment, and the wicked who have already been punished and will not be resurrected on Judgment Day. The Book of Enoch is considered apocryphal by most denominations of Christianity and all of Judaism.

The book of 2 Maccabees clearly describes the dead waiting for future resurrection and judgment, along with prayers and offerings for the deceased to alleviate their sins.
The author of the Gospel of Luke recounts the story of Lazarus and the rich man, which shows people in Hades awaiting the resurrection either in comfort or torment. The author of the Book of Revelation writes about God and the angels versus Satan and demons in an epic battle at the end of times when all souls are judged. There is mention of ghostly bodies of the prophets and the transfiguration.

The non-canonical Acts of Paul and Thecla speak of the efficacy of prayer for the dead so that they might be &quot;translated to a state of happiness&quot;.

Hippolytus of Rome pictures the underworld (Hades) as a place where the righteous dead, waiting in the bosom of Abraham for their resurrection, rejoice at their future prospect; the unrighteous are tormented at the sight of the &quot;lake of unquenchable fire&quot; into which they are destined to be cast.

Gregory of Nyssa discusses the long-before-believed possibility of purification of souls after death.

Pope Gregory I repeats the concept, articulated over a century earlier by Gregory of Nyssa, that the saved suffer purification after death. In connection with this, he wrote of &quot;purgatorial flames.&quot;

The noun &quot;purgatorium&quot; (Latin: place of cleansing) is used for the first time to describe a state of painful purification of the saved afterlife. The same word in adjectival form (&quot;purgatorius -a -um&quot;, cleansing), which appears also in non-religious writing, was already used by Christians such as Augustine of Hippo and Pope Gregory I to refer to an after-death cleansing.

Theologians and philosophers presented various philosophies and beliefs during the Age of Enlightenment. A notable example is Emanuel Swedenborg who wrote some 18 theological works which describe in detail the nature of the afterlife according to his claimed spiritual experiences, the most famous of which is &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot;. His report of life there covers a wide range of topics, such as marriage in heaven (where all angels are married), children in heaven (where they are raised by angel parents), time and space in heaven (there are none), the after-death awakening process in the World of Spirits (a place halfway between Heaven and Hell and where people first wake up after death), the allowance of a free will choice between Heaven or Hell (as opposed to being sent to either one by God), the eternity of Hell (one could leave but would never want to), and that all angels or devils were once people on earth.

====The Catholic Church====
The Catholic conception of the afterlife teaches that after the body dies, the soul is judged, the righteous and free of sin enter Heaven. However, those who die in unrepented mortal sin go to hell. In the 1990s, the Catechism of the Catholic Church defined hell not as punishment imposed on the sinner but rather as the sinner&#x27;s self-exclusion from God. Unlike other Christian groups, the Catholic Church teaches that those who die in a state of grace but still carry venial sin go to a place called Purgatory, where they undergo purification to enter Heaven.

====Limbo====

Despite popular opinion, Limbo, which was elaborated upon by theologians beginning in the Middle Ages, was never recognized as a dogma of the Catholic Church, yet, at times, it has been a very popular theological theory within the Church. Limbo is a theory that unbaptized but innocent souls, such as those of infants or virtuous individuals who lived before Jesus Christ was born, exist in neither Heaven nor Hell proper. Therefore, these souls neither merit the beatific vision nor are subjected to any punishment because they are not guilty of any personal sin although they have not received baptism, so they still bear original sin. So, they are generally seen as existing in a state of natural, but not supernatural, happiness until the end of time.

In other Christian denominations, it has been described as an intermediate place or state of confinement in oblivion and neglect.

====Purgatory====

The notion of purgatory is associated mainly with the Catholic Church. In the Catholic Church, all those who die in God&#x27;s grace and friendship but are still imperfectly purified are indeed assured of their eternal salvation. Still, after death, they undergo purification to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of heaven or the final purification of the elect, which is entirely different from the punishment of the damned. The tradition of the church, by reference to specific texts of scripture, speaks of a &quot;cleansing fire&quot;, but it is not always called purgatory.

Anglicans of the Anglo-Catholic tradition generally also hold to the belief. John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, believed in an intermediate state between death and the resurrection of the dead and in the possibility of &quot;continuing to grow in holiness there&quot;, but Methodism does not officially affirm this belief and denies the possibility of helping by prayer any who may be in that state.

====Orthodox Christianity====
The Orthodox Church is intentionally reticent about the afterlife, as it acknowledges the mystery, especially of things that have not yet occurred. Beyond the second coming of Jesus, bodily resurrection, and final judgment, all of which are affirmed in the Nicene Creed (325 AD), Orthodoxy does not teach much else in any definitive manner. Unlike Western forms of Christianity, however, Orthodoxy is traditionally non-dualist and does not teach that there are two separate literal locations of heaven and hell, but instead acknowledges that &quot;the &#x27;location&#x27; of one&#x27;s final destiny—heaven or hell—as being figurative.&quot;

Instead, Orthodoxy teaches that the final judgment is one&#x27;s uniform encounter with divine love and mercy, but this encounter is experienced multifariously depending on the extent to which one has been transformed, partaken of divinity, and is therefore compatible or incompatible with God. &quot;The monadic, immutable, and ceaseless object of eschatological encounter is therefore the love and mercy of God, his glory which infuses the heavenly temple, and it is the subjective human reaction which engenders multiplicity or any division of experience.&quot; For instance, St. Isaac the Syrian observes in his &quot;Ascetical Homilies&quot; that &quot;those who are punished in Gehenna, are scourged by the scourge of love. ... The power of love works in two ways: it torments sinners ... [as] bitter regret. But love inebriates the souls of the sons of Heaven by its delectability.&quot; In this sense, the divine action is always, immutably, and uniformly love, and if one experiences this love negatively, the experience is then one of self-condemnation because of free will rather than condemnation by God.

Orthodoxy therefore uses the description of Jesus&#x27; judgment in John 3:19–21 as their model: &quot;19 And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil. 20 For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed. 21 But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God.&quot; As a characteristically Orthodox understanding, then, Fr. Thomas Hopko writes, &quot;[I]t is precisely the presence of God&#x27;s mercy and love which cause the torment of the wicked. God does not punish; he forgives... In a word, God has mercy on all, whether all like it or not. If we like it, it is paradise; if we do not, it is hell. Every knee will bend before the Lord. Everything will be subject to Him. God in Christ will indeed be &#x27;all and in all,&#x27; with boundless mercy and unconditional pardon. But not all will rejoice in God&#x27;s gift of forgiveness, and that choice will be judgment, the self-inflicted source of their sorrow and pain.&quot;

Moreover, Orthodoxy includes a prevalent tradition of &quot;apokatastasis&quot;, or the restoration of all things in the end. This has been taught most notably by Origen, but also many other Church fathers and Saints, including Gregory of Nyssa. The Second Council of Constantinople (553 AD) affirmed the orthodoxy of Gregory of Nyssa while simultaneously condemning Origen&#x27;s brand of universalism because it taught the restoration back to our pre-existent state, which Orthodoxy does not teach. It is also a teaching of such eminent Orthodox theologians as Olivier Clément, Metropolitan Kallistos Ware, and Bishop Hilarion Alfeyev. Although apokatastasis is not a dogma of the church but instead a , it is no less a teaching of the Orthodox Church than its rejection. As Met. Kallistos Ware explains, &quot;It is heretical to say that all must be saved, for this is to deny free will; but, it is legitimate to hope that all may be saved,&quot; as insisting on torment without end also denies free will.

====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints====
Joseph F. Smith of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints presents an elaborate vision of the afterlife. It is revealed as the scene of an extensive missionary effort by righteous spirits in paradise to redeem those still in darkness—a spirit prison or &quot;hell&quot; where the souls of the dead remain until judgment. It is divided into two parts: Spirit Prison and Paradise. These are also known as the Spirit World (also Abraham&#x27;s Bosom; see Luke 16:19–25). They believe that Christ visited the spirit prison (1 Peter 3:18–20) and opened the gate for those who repent to cross over to Paradise. This is similar to the Harrowing of Hell doctrine of some mainstream Christian faiths. Both Spirit Prison and Paradise are temporary according to Latter-day Saint beliefs. After the resurrection, spirits are assigned &quot;permanently&quot; to three degrees of heavenly glory, determined by how they lived – Celestial, Terrestrial, and Telestial. (1 Cor 15:44–42; Doctrine and Covenants, Section 76) Sons of Perdition, or those who have known and seen God and deny it, will be sent to the realm of Satan, which is called Outer Darkness, where they shall live in misery and agony forever. However, according to the beliefs of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, most persons lack the amount of knowledge to commit the Eternal sin and are therefore incapable of becoming sons of perdition.

The Celestial Kingdom is believed to be where the righteous can live eternally with their families. Progression does not end once one has entered the Celestial Kingdom but extends eternally. According to &quot;True to the Faith&quot; (a handbook on doctrines in the LDS faith), &quot;The celestial kingdom is the place prepared for those who have &quot;received the testimony of Jesus&quot; and been &quot;made perfect through Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, who wrought out this perfect atonement through the shedding of his own blood&quot; (Doctrine and Covenants, 76:51, 69). To inherit this gift, we must receive the ordinances of salvation, keep the commandments, and repent of our sins.&quot;

====Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses====
Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses occasionally use terms such as &quot;afterlife&quot; to refer to any hope for the dead, but they understand Ecclesiastes 9:5 to preclude belief in an immortal soul. Individuals judged by God to be wicked, such as in the Great Flood or at Armageddon, are given no hope of an afterlife. However, they believe that after Armageddon, there will be a bodily resurrection of &quot;both righteous and unrighteous&quot; dead (but not the &quot;wicked&quot;). Survivors of Armageddon and those who are resurrected are then to restore the Earth to a paradise gradually. After Armageddon, unrepentant sinners are punished with eternal death (non-existence).

====Seventh-day Adventists====

The Seventh-day Adventist Church&#x27;s beliefs regarding the afterlife differ from those of other Christian churches. Rather than ascend to Heaven or descend to Hell, Adventists believe the dead &quot;remain unconscious until the return of Christ in judgement&quot;. The concept that the dead remain dead until resurrection is one of the fundamental beliefs of Seventh-day Adventism. Adventists believe that death is an unconscious state (a &quot;sleep&quot;). This is based on Matt. 9:24; Mark 5:39; John 11:11–14; 1 Cor. 15:51, 52; 1 Thess. 4:13–17; 2 Peter 3:4; Eccl. 9:5, 6, 10. At death, all consciousness ends. The dead person does not know anything and does not do anything. They believe that death is a decreation, or an undoing of what was created. This is described in Ecclesiastes 12:7: &quot;When a person dies, the body turns to dust again, and the spirit goes back to God, who gave it.&quot; The spirit of every person who dies—whether saved or unsaved—returns to God at death. The spirit that returns to God at death is the breath of life.

===Islam===
The Quran (the holy book of Islam) emphasizes the insignificance of worldly life (&quot;ḥayāt ad-dunyā&quot; usually translated as &quot;this world&quot;) vis-a-vis the hereafter.
A central doctrine of Islamic faith is the Judgement Day (&quot;al-yawm al-ākhir&quot;, also known by other names), on which the world will come to an end and God will raise all mankind (as well as the &quot;jinn&quot;) from the dead and evaluate their worldly actions. The resurrected will be judged according to their deeds, records of which are kept on two books compiled for every human being—one for their good deeds and one for their evil ones.

Having been judged, the resurrected will cross the bridge of As-Sirāt over the pit of hell; when the condemned attempt to they will be made to fall off into hellfire below, while the righteous will have no trouble and continue on to their eternal abode of heaven.

Afterlife in Islam actually begins before the Last Day. After death, humans will be questioned about their faith by two angels, Munkar and Nakīr. Those who die as martyrs go immediately to paradise. Others who have died and been buried will receive a taste of their eternal reward from the &quot;al-qabr&quot; or &quot;the grave&quot; (compare the Jewish concept of Sheol). Those bound for hell will suffer &quot;Punishment of the Grave&quot;, while those bound for heaven will find the grave &quot;peaceful and blessed&quot;.

Islamic scripture—the Quran and hadith (reports of the words and deeds of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad who is believed to have visited heaven and hell during his Isra and Mi&#x27;raj journey) – give vivid descriptions of the pleasures of paradise (Jannah) and sufferings of hell (&quot;Jahannam&quot;). The gardens of Jannah have cool shade, adorned couchs and cushions, rich carpets spread out, cups full of wine, and every meat and fruit. Men will be provided with perpetually youthful, beautiful &quot;ḥūr&quot;, &quot;untouched beforehand by man or jinn&quot;, with large, beautiful eyes. (In recent years some have argued that the term &quot;ḥūr&quot; refers both to pure men and pure women, and/or that Quranic references to &quot;immortal boys&quot; (, ) or &quot;young men&quot; () (&quot;ghilmān&quot;, &quot;wildān&quot;, and &quot;suqāh&quot;) who serve wine and meals to the blessed, are the male equivalents of hur.)

In contrast, those in Jahannam will dwell in a land infested with thousands of serpents and scorpions; be &quot;burnt&quot; by &quot;scorching fire&quot; and when &quot;their skins are roasted through, We shall change them for fresh skins&quot; to repeat the process forever ; they will have nothing to drink but &quot;boiling water and running sores&quot;; their cries of remorse and pleading for forgiveness will be in vain.

Traditionally &quot;Jannah&quot; and &quot;Jahannam&quot; are thought to have different levels. Eight gates and eight levels in &quot;Jannah&quot;, where the higher the level the better it is and the happier you are. &quot;Jahannam&quot; possess seven layers. Each layer more horrible than the one above.

The Quran teaches that the purpose of Man&#x27;s creation is to worship God and God alone. Those it describes as being punished in hell are &quot;most typically&quot; unbelievers, including those who worship others besides Allah, those who deny the divine origin of the Quran , or the coming of Judgement Day.

Straightforward crimes/sins against other people are also grounds for going to hell: the murder of a believer, usury (Q.2:275), devouring the property of an orphan , and slander , particularly of a chaste woman. However, it is a common belief among Muslims that whatever crimes/sins Muslims may have committed, their punishment in hell will be temporary. Only unbelievers will reside in hell permanently. Thus Jahannam combines both the concept of an eternal hell (for unbelievers), and what is known in Christian Catholicism as purgatory (for believers eventually destined for heaven after punishment for their sins).

The common belief holds that &quot;Jahannam&quot; coexists with the temporal world. Mainstream Islam teaches the continued existence of the soul and a transformed physical existence after death. The resurrection that will take place on the Last Day is physical, and is explained by suggesting that God will re-create the decayed body (&quot;Have they not realized that Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth, can ˹easily˺ re-create them?&quot; ).

====Ahmadiyya====
Ahmadi Muslims believe that the afterlife is not material but of a spiritual nature. According to Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, founder of the Ahmadiyya, the soul will give birth to another rarer entity and will resemble the life on this earth in the sense that this entity will bear a similar relationship to the soul as the soul bears relationship with the human existence on earth. On earth, if a person leads a righteous life and submits to the will of God, his or her tastes become attuned to enjoying spiritual pleasures as opposed to carnal desires. With this, an &quot;embryonic soul&quot; begins to take shape. Different tastes are said to be born which a person given to carnal passions finds no enjoyment. For example, sacrifice of one&#x27;s own rights over that of others becomes enjoyable, or that forgiveness becomes second nature. In such a state a person finds contentment and peace at heart and at this stage, according to Ahmadiyya beliefs, it can be said that a soul within the soul has begun to take shape.

====Sufism====
The Sufi Muslim scholar Ibn &#x27;Arabi defined Barzakh as the intermediate realm or &quot;isthmus&quot;. It is between the world of corporeal bodies and the world of spirits, and is a means of contact between the two worlds. Without it, there would be no contact between the two and both would cease to exist. He described it as simple and luminous, like the world of spirits, but also able to take on many different forms just like the world of corporeal bodies can. In broader terms Barzakh, &quot;is anything that separates two things&quot;. It has been called the dream world in which the dreamer is in both life and death.

===Baháʼí Faith===

The teachings of the Baháʼí Faith state that the nature of the afterlife is beyond the understanding of those living, just as an unborn fetus cannot understand the nature of the world outside of the womb. The Baháʼí writings state that the soul is immortal and after death it will continue to progress until it finally attains God&#x27;s presence. In Baháʼí belief, souls in the afterlife will continue to retain their individuality and consciousness and will be able to recognize and communicate spiritually with other souls whom they have made deep profound friendships with, such as their spouses.

The Baháʼí scriptures also state there are distinctions between souls in the afterlife, and that souls will recognize the worth of their own deeds and understand the consequences of their actions. It is explained that those souls that have turned toward God will experience gladness, while those who have lived in error will become aware of the opportunities they have lost. Also, in the Baháʼí view, souls will be able to recognize the accomplishments of the souls that have reached the same level as themselves, but not those that have achieved a rank higher than them.

==Indian religions==

Early Indian religions were characterized by the belief in an afterlife, Ancestor worship, and related rites. These concepts started to significantly change after the period of the Upanishads.

===Buddhism===
Afterlife in Buddhism consists of intermediated spirit realm that&#x27;s beyond spatial means, which includes the six realms of existence, the 31 planes of existence, Naraka, Tengoku and the pure land after achieving enlightenment. Ancestor worship, and links to one&#x27;s ancestors, was once an important component of early Buddhism, but became less relevant already before the formation of the different Buddhist streams. The concepts and importance of afterlife vary among modern Buddhist teachings.

Buddhists maintain that rebirth takes place without an unchanging self or soul passing from one form to another. The type of rebirth will be conditioned by the moral tone of the person&#x27;s actions (kamma or karma). For example, if a person has committed harmful actions by body, speech and mind based on greed, hate and delusion, would have his/her rebirth in a lower realm, i.e. an animal, a hungry ghost or a hell realm, is to be expected. On the other hand, where a person has performed skillful actions based on generosity, loving-kindness (metta), compassion and wisdom, rebirth in a happy realm, i.e. human or one of the many heavenly realms, can be expected.

However, the mechanism of rebirth with Kamma is not deterministic. It depends on various levels of kamma. The most important moment that determines where a person is reborn into is the last thought moment. At that moment, heavy kamma would ripen if there were performed. If not, near death kamma would ripen, and if not death kamma, then habitual kamma would ripen. Finally if none of the above happened, then residual kamma from previous actions can ripen. According to Theravada Buddhism, there are 31 realms of existence that one can be reborn into. According to these, 31 existences comprise 20 existences of supreme deities (Brahmas); 6 existences of deities (Devas); the human existence (Manussa); and, lastly, 4 existences of deprivation or unhappiness (Apaya).

Pure Land Buddhism of Mahayana believes in a special place apart from the 31 planes of existence called Pure Land. It is believed that each Buddha has their own pure land, created out of their merits for the sake of sentient beings who recall them mindfully to be able to be reborn in their pure land and train to become a Buddha there. Thus the main practice of pure land Buddhism is to chant a Buddha&#x27;s name.

In Tibetan Buddhism the Tibetan Book of the Dead explains the intermediate state of humans between death and reincarnation. The deceased will find the bright light of wisdom, which shows a straightforward path to move upward and leave the cycle of reincarnation. There are various reasons why the deceased do not follow that light. Some had no briefing about the intermediate state in the former life. Others only used to follow their basic instincts like animals. And some have fear, which results from foul deeds in the former life or from insistent haughtiness. In the intermediate state the awareness is very flexible, so it is important to be virtuous, adopt a positive attitude, and avoid negative ideas. Ideas which are rising from subconsciousness can cause extreme tempers and cowing visions. In this situation they have to understand, that these manifestations are just reflections of the inner thoughts. No one can really hurt them, because they have no more material body. The deceased get help from different Buddhas who show them the path to the bright light. The ones who do not follow the path after all will get hints for a better reincarnation. They have to release the things and beings on which or whom they still hang from the life before. It is recommended to choose a family where the parents trust in the Dharma and to reincarnate with the will to care for the welfare of all beings.

===Hinduism===

There are two major views of an afterlife in Hinduism: mythical and philosophical. The philosophies of Hinduism consider each individual consists of three bodies: physical body compose of water and bio-matter (&quot;sthūla śarīra&quot;), an energetic/psychic/mental/subtle body (&quot;sūkṣma-śarīra&quot;) and a causal body (&quot;kāraṇa śarīra&quot;) comprising subliminal stuff i.e. mental impressions etc.

The individual is a stream of consciousness (&quot;Ātman&quot;), which flows through all the physical changes of the body and at the death of the physical body, flows on into another physical body. The two components that transmigrate are the subtle body and the causal body.

The thought that occupies the mind at the time of death determines the quality of our rebirth (antim smaraṇa), hence Hinduism advises to be mindful of one&#x27;s thoughts and cultivate positive wholesome thoughts – mantra chanting (japa) is commonly practiced for this.

The mythical includes the philosophical but adds heaven and hell myths.

When one leaves the physical body at death he appears in the court of Yama, the God of Death, for an exit interview. The panel consists of Yama and Chitragupta – the cosmic accountant, he has a book which consists the history of the dead persons according to his/her mistakes the Yama decides the punishment is and Varuna, the cosmic intelligence officer. He is counseled about his life, achievements and failures and is shown a mirror in which his entire life is reflected. Philosophically, these three men are projections of one&#x27;s mind. Yama sends him to a heavenly realm (Svarga) if he has been exceptionally benevolent and beneficent for a period of rest and recreation. His period is limited in time by the weight of his good deeds. If he has been exceptionally malevolent and caused immense suffering to other beings, then he is sent to a hell realm (Naraka) for his sins. After one has exhausted his karma, he takes birth again to continue his spiritual evolution. However, the belief in rebirth was not a part of early Vedic religions and texts. It was later developed by &quot;rishi&quot;s (sages) who challenged the idea of one&#x27;s life as being simplistic.

Rebirth can take place as a god (deva), a human (manuṣya) an animal (tiryak)—but it is generally taught that the spiritual evolution takes place from lower to higher species. In certain cases of traumatic death a person can take the form of a preta or hungry ghost – and remains in an earth-bound state interminably – until certain ceremonies are done to liberate them. This mythological part is extensively elaborated in the Puranas, especially in the Garuda Purana.

The Upanishads are the first scriptures in Hinduism which explicitly mention the afterlife. The Bhagavad Gita, a famous Hindu scripture, says that just as a man discards his old clothes and wears new ones; similarly the Atman discards the old body and takes on a new one. In Hinduism, the belief is that the body is nothing but a shell, the consciousness inside is immutable and indestructible and takes on different lives in a cycle of birth and death. The end of this cycle is called &quot;mukti&quot; () and staying finally with the ultimate reality forever is &quot;moksha&quot; () or liberation.

The (diverse) views of modern Hinduism in part differ significantly from the Historical Vedic religion.

===Jainism===
Jainism also believes in the afterlife. They believe that the soul takes on a body form based on previous karmas or actions performed by that soul through eternity. Jains believe the soul is eternal and that the freedom from the cycle of reincarnation is the means to attain eternal bliss.

===Sikhism===
The essential doctrine of Sikhism is to experience the divine through simple living, meditation, and contemplation while being alive. Sikhism also has the belief of being in union with God while living. Accounts of afterlife are considered to be aimed at the popular prevailing views of the time so as to provide a referential framework without necessarily establishing a belief in the afterlife. Thus while it is also acknowledged that living the life of a householder is above the metaphysical truth, Sikhism can be considered agnostic to the question of an afterlife. Some scholars also interpret the mention of reincarnation to be naturalistic akin to the biogeochemical cycles.

But if one analyses the Sikh Scriptures carefully, one may find that on many occasions the afterlife and the existence of heaven and hell are mentioned and criticised in &quot;Guru Granth Sahib&quot; and in &quot;Dasam Granth&quot; as non-true man made ideas, so from that it can be concluded that Sikhism does not believe in the existence of heaven and hell; however, heaven and hell are created to temporarily reward and punish, and one will then take birth again until one merges in God. According to the Sikh scriptures, the human form is the closet form to God if the Guru is read and understood, and the best opportunity for a human being to attain salvation and merge back with God and fully understand Him. Sikh Gurus said that nothing dies, nothing is born, everything is ever present, and it just changes forms. Like standing in front of a wardrobe, you pick up a dress and wear it and then you discard it. You wear another one. Thus, in the view of Sikhism, your soul is never born and never dies. Your soul is a part of God and hence lives forever.

==Others==
===Confucianism===
Confucius did not directly discuss the afterlife. Nonetheless, Chinese folk religion has had a strong influence on Confucianism, so adherents believe that their ancestors become deified spirits after death. Ancestor veneration in China is widespread.

===Gnosticism===
In Gnostic teachings humans contain a divine spark within them said to have been trapped in their bodies by the creator of the material universe known as the Demiurge. It was believed that this spark could be released from the material world and enter into the heavenly spiritual world beyond it if special knowledge or gnosis was attained. The Cathars, for example, viewed reincarnation as a trap made by Satan, who tricked angels from the heavenly realm into entering the physical bodies of humans. They viewed the purpose of life as a way to escape the constant cycle of spiritual incarnations by letting go of worldly attachments.

===Shinto===

It is common for families to participate in ceremonies for children at a shrine, yet have a Buddhist funeral at the time of death. In old Japanese legends, it is often claimed that the dead go to a place called &quot;yomi&quot; (黄泉), a gloomy underground realm with a river separating the living from the dead mentioned in the legend of Izanami and Izanagi. This &quot;yomi&quot; very closely resembles the Greek Hades; however, later myths include notions of resurrection and even Elysium-like descriptions such as in the legend of Ōkuninushi and Susanoo. Shinto tends to hold negative views on death and corpses as a source of pollution called &quot;kegare&quot;. However, death is also viewed as a path towards apotheosis in Shintoism as can be evidenced by how legendary individuals become enshrined after death. Perhaps the most famous would be Emperor Ōjin who was enshrined as Hachiman the God of War after his death.

===Spiritualism===
The spirit world, according to spiritualism, is the world or realm inhabited by spirits, both good or evil of various spiritual manifestations. This spirit world is regarded as an external environment for spirits. The Spiritualism religious movement in the nineteenth century espoused a belief in an afterlife where individual&#x27;s awareness persists beyond death.

===Taoism===
Taoism views life as an illusion and death as a transformation into immortality. Taoists believe that immortality of the soul can be achieved by living a virtuous life in harmony with the Tao. They are taught not to fear death, as it is simply part of nature.

===Traditional African religions===
Traditional African religions are diverse in their beliefs in an afterlife. Hunter-gatherer societies such as the Hadza have no particular belief in an afterlife, and the death of an individual is a straightforward end to their existence. Ancestor cults are found throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, including cultures like the Yombe, Beng, Yoruba and Ewe, &quot;[T]he belief that the dead come back into life and are reborn into their families is given concrete expression in the personal names that are given to children...What is reincarnated are some of the dominant characteristics of the ancestor and not his soul. For each soul remains distinct and each birth represents a new soul.&quot; The Yoruba, Dogon and LoDagoa have eschatological ideas similar to Abrahamic religions, &quot;but in most African societies, there is a marked absence of such clear-cut notions of heaven and hell, although there are notions of God judging the soul after death.&quot; In some societies like the Mende, multiple beliefs coexist. The Mende believe that people die twice: once during the process of joining the secret society, and again during biological death after which they become ancestors. However, some Mende also believe that after people are created by God they live ten consecutive lives, each in progressively descending worlds. One cross-cultural theme is that the ancestors are part of the world of the living, interacting with it regularly.

===Unitarian Universalism===
Some Unitarian Universalists believe in universalism: that all souls will ultimately be saved and that there are no torments of hell. Unitarian Universalists differ widely in their theology hence there is no exact same stance on the issue. Although Unitarians historically believed in a literal hell, and Universalists historically believed that everyone goes to heaven, modern Unitarian Universalists can be categorized into those believing in a heaven, reincarnation and oblivion. Most Unitarian Universalists believe that heaven and hell are symbolic places of consciousness and the faith is largely focused on the worldly life rather than any possible afterlife.

===Wicca===
The Wiccan afterlife is most commonly described as The Summerland. Here, souls rest, recuperate from life, and reflect on the experiences they had during their lives. After a period of rest, the souls are reincarnated, and the memory of their previous lives is erased. Many Wiccans see The Summerland as a place to reflect on their life actions. It is not a place of reward, but rather the end of a life journey at an end point of incarnations.

===Zoroastrianism===
Zoroastrianism states that the &quot;urvan&quot;, the disembodied spirit, lingers on earth for three days before departing downward to the kingdom of the dead that is ruled by Yima. For the three days that it rests on Earth, righteous souls sit at the head of their body, chanting the Ustavaiti Gathas with joy, while a wicked person sits at the feet of the corpse, wails and recites the Yasna. Zoroastrianism states that for the righteous souls, a beautiful maiden, which is the personification of the soul&#x27;s good thoughts, words and deeds, appears. For a wicked person, a very old, ugly, naked hag appears. After three nights, the soul of the wicked is taken by the demon Vizaresa (Vīzarəša), to Chinvat bridge, and is made to go to darkness (hell).

Yima is believed to have been the first king on earth to rule, as well as the first man to die. Inside of Yima&#x27;s realm, the spirits live a shadowy existence, and are dependent on their own descendants which are still living on Earth. Their descendants are to satisfy their hunger and clothe them, through rituals done on earth.

Rituals which are done on the first three days are vital and important, as they protect the soul from evil powers and give it strength to reach the underworld. After three days, the soul crosses Chinvat bridge which is the Final Judgment of the soul. Rashnu and Sraosha are present at the final judgment. The list is expanded sometimes, and include Vahman and Ormazd. Rashnu is the yazata who holds the scales of justice. If the good deeds of the person outweigh the bad, the soul is worthy of paradise. If the bad deeds outweigh the good, the bridge narrows down to the width of a blade-edge, and a horrid hag pulls the soul in her arms, and takes it down to hell with her.

Misvan Gatu is the &quot;place of the mixed ones&quot; where the souls lead a gray existence, lacking both joy and sorrow. A soul goes here if his/her good deeds and bad deeds are equal, and Rashnu&#x27;s scale is equal.

==Parapsychology==
The Society for Psychical Research was founded in 1882 with the express intention of investigating phenomena relating to Spiritualism and the afterlife. Its members continue to conduct scientific research on the paranormal to this day. Some of the earliest attempts to apply scientific methods to the study of phenomena relating to an afterlife were conducted by this organization. Its earliest members included noted scientists like William Crookes, and philosophers such as Henry Sidgwick and William James.

Parapsychological investigation of the afterlife includes the study of haunting, apparitions of the deceased, instrumental trans-communication, electronic voice phenomena, and mediumship.

A study conducted in 1901 by physician Duncan MacDougall sought to measure the weight lost by a human when the soul &quot;departed the body&quot; upon death. MacDougall weighed dying patients in an attempt to prove that the soul was material, tangible and thus measurable. Although MacDougall&#x27;s results varied considerably from &quot;21 grams&quot;, for some people this figure has become synonymous with the measure of a soul&#x27;s mass. The title of the 2003 movie &quot;21 Grams&quot; is a reference to MacDougall&#x27;s findings. His results have never been reproduced, and are generally regarded either as meaningless or considered to have had little if any scientific merit.

Frank Tipler has argued that physics can explain immortality, although such arguments are not falsifiable and, in Karl Popper&#x27;s views, they do not qualify as science.

After 25 years of parapsychological research Susan Blackmore came to the conclusion that, according to her experiences, there is not enough empirical evidence for many of these cases.

===Mediumship===
Mediums purportedly act as a vessel for communications from spirits in other realms. Mediumship is not specific to one culture or religion; it can be identified in several belief systems, most notably Spiritualism. While the practice gained popularity in Europe and North America in the 19th century, evidence of mediumship dates back thousands of years in Asia. Mediums who claim to have contact with deceased people include Tyler Henry and Pascal Voggenhuber.

===Near death research===
Research also includes the study of the near death experience. Scientists who have worked in this area include Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, Raymond Moody, Sam Parnia, Michael Sabom, Bruce Greyson, Peter Fenwick, Jeffrey Long, Susan Blackmore, Charles Tart, William James, Ian Stevenson, Michael Persinger, Pim van Lommel, Penny Sartori, Walter van Laack among others.

=== Past life regression ===
Past life regression is a method that uses hypnosis to recover what practitioners believe are memories of past lives or incarnations. The technique used during past-life regression involves the subject answering a series of questions while hypnotized to reveal identity and events of alleged past lives, a method similar to that used in recovered memory therapy and one that, similarly, often misrepresents memory as a faithful recording of previous events rather than a constructed set of recollections.

However, medical experts and practitioners do not agree that the past life memories gained from past life regressions are truly from past lives; experts generally regard claims of recovered memories of past lives as fantasies or delusions or a type of confabulation, because the use of hypnosis and suggestive questions can tend to leave the subject particularly likely to hold distorted or false memories.

==Philosophy==
===Modern philosophy===
There is a view based on the philosophical question of personal identity, termed open individualism by Daniel Kolak, that concludes that individual conscious experience is illusory, and because consciousness continues after death in all conscious beings, &quot;you&quot; do not die. This position has allegedly been supported by physicists such as Erwin Schrödinger and Freeman Dyson.

Certain problems arise with the idea of a particular person continuing after death. Peter van Inwagen, in his argument regarding resurrection, notes that the materialist must have some sort of physical continuity. John Hick also raises questions regarding personal identity in his book, &quot;Death and Eternal Life&quot;, using an example of a person ceasing to exist in one place while an exact replica appears in another. If the replica had all the same experiences, traits, and physical appearances of the first person, we would all attribute the same identity to the second, according to Hick.

===Process philosophy===
In the panentheistic model of process philosophy and theology the writers Alfred North Whitehead and Charles Hartshorne rejected the idea that the universe was made of substance, instead saying reality is composed of living experiences (occasions of experience). According to Hartshorne people do not experience subjective (or personal) immortality in the afterlife, but they do have objective immortality because their experiences live on forever in God, who contains all that was. However other process philosophers such as David Ray Griffin have written that people may have subjective experience after death.

==Science==
Psychological proposals for the origin of a belief in an afterlife include cognitive disposition, cultural learning, and as an intuitive religious idea. Fear of death or death anxiety is hypothesized to be a primary motivator for afterlife beliefs. Jamin Halberstadt finds that one function of religion is to alleviate death anxiety via afterlife beliefs. There also is research about afterlife beliefs from an evolutionary perspective, i.e. in the context of group selection.

=== Near death experiences ===

In 2008, a large-scale study conducted by the University of Southampton involving 2,060 patients from 15 hospitals in the United Kingdom, United States and Austria was launched. The AWARE (AWAreness during REsuscitation) study examined the broad range of mental experiences in relation to death. In a large study, researchers also tested the validity of conscious experiences for the first time using objective markers, to determine whether claims of awareness compatible with out-of-body experiences correspond with real or hallucinatory events. The results revealed that 40% of those who survived a cardiac arrest were aware during the time that they were clinically dead and before their hearts were restarted. One patient also had a verified out-of-body experience (over 80% of patients did not survive their cardiac arrest or were too sick to be interviewed), but his cardiac arrest occurred in a room without markers. Dr. Parnia in the interview stated, &quot;The evidence thus far suggests that in the first few minutes after death, consciousness is not annihilated.&quot; The AWARE study drew the following primary conclusions:

# In some cases of cardiac arrest, memories of visual awareness compatible with so called out-of-body experiences may correspond with actual events.
# A number of NDErs may have vivid death experiences, but do not recall them due to the effects of brain injury or sedative drugs on memory circuits.
# The recalled experience surrounding death merits a genuine investigation without prejudice.

Studies have also been done on the widely reported phenomenon of near death experiences (NDE). Experiencers commonly report being transported to a different &quot;realm&quot; or &quot;plane of existence&quot; and they have been shown to display a lasting positive aftereffect on most experiencers.

<text>Astrometry is a branch of astronomy that involves precise measurements of the positions and movements of stars and other celestial bodies. It provides the kinematics and physical origin of the Solar System and this galaxy, the Milky Way.

==History==

The history of astrometry is linked to the history of star catalogues, which gave astronomers reference points for objects in the sky so they could track their movements. This can be dated back to the ancient Greek astronomer Hipparchus, who around 190 BC used the catalogue of his predecessors Timocharis and Aristillus to discover Earth&#x27;s precession. In doing so, he also developed the brightness scale still in use today. Hipparchus compiled a catalogue with at least 850 stars and their positions. Hipparchus&#x27;s successor, Ptolemy, included a catalogue of 1,022 stars in his work the &quot;Almagest&quot;, giving their location, coordinates, and brightness.

In the 10th century, the Iranian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi carried out observations on the stars and described their positions, magnitudes and star color; furthermore, he provided drawings for each constellation, which are depicted in his &quot;Book of Fixed Stars&quot;. Egyptian mathematician Ibn Yunus observed more than 10,000 entries for the Sun&#x27;s position for many years using a large astrolabe with a diameter of nearly 1.4 metres. His observations on eclipses were still used centuries later in Canadian–American astronomer Simon Newcomb&#x27;s investigations on the motion of the Moon, while his other observations of the motions of the planets Jupiter and Saturn inspired French scholar Laplace&#x27;s &quot;Obliquity of the Ecliptic&quot; and &quot;Inequalities of Jupiter and Saturn&quot;. In the 15th century, the Timurid astronomer Ulugh Beg compiled the &quot;Zij-i-Sultani&quot;, in which he catalogued 1,019 stars. Like the earlier catalogs of Hipparchus and Ptolemy, Ulugh Beg&#x27;s catalogue is estimated to have been precise to within approximately 20 minutes of arc.

In the 16th century, Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe used improved instruments, including large mural instruments, to measure star positions more accurately than previously, with a precision of 15–35 arcsec. Ottoman scholar Taqi al-Din measured the right ascension of the stars at the Constantinople Observatory of Taqi ad-Din using the &quot;observational clock&quot; he invented. When telescopes became commonplace, setting circles sped measurements

English astronomer James Bradley first tried to measure stellar parallaxes in 1729. The stellar movement proved too insignificant for his telescope, but he instead discovered the aberration of light and the nutation of the Earth&#x27;s axis. His cataloguing of 3222 stars was refined in 1807 by German astronomer Friedrich Bessel, the father of modern astrometry. He made the first measurement of stellar parallax: 0.3 arcsec for the binary star 61 Cygni. In 1872, British astronomer William Huggins used spectroscopy to measure the radial velocity of several prominent stars, including Sirius.

Being very difficult to measure, only about 60 stellar parallaxes had been obtained by the end of the 19th century, mostly by use of the filar micrometer. Astrographs using astronomical photographic plates sped the process in the early 20th century. Automated plate-measuring machines and more sophisticated computer technology of the 1960s allowed more efficient compilation of star catalogues. Started in the late 19th century, the project Carte du Ciel to improve star mapping could not be finished but made photography a common technique for astrometry. In the 1980s, charge-coupled devices (CCDs) replaced photographic plates and reduced optical uncertainties to one milliarcsecond. This technology made astrometry less expensive, opening the field to an amateur audience.

In 1989, the European Space Agency&#x27;s Hipparcos satellite took astrometry into orbit, where it could be less affected by mechanical forces of the Earth and optical distortions from its atmosphere. Operated from 1989 to 1993, Hipparcos measured large and small angles on the sky with much greater precision than any previous optical telescopes. During its 4-year run, the positions, parallaxes, and proper motions of 118,218 stars were determined with an unprecedented degree of accuracy. A new &quot;Tycho catalog&quot; drew together a database of 1,058,332 stars to within 20-30 mas (milliarcseconds). Additional catalogues were compiled for the 23,882 double and multiple stars and 11,597 variable stars also analyzed during the Hipparcos mission.
In 2013, the Gaia satellite was launched and improved the accuracy of Hipparcos.
The precision was improved by a factor of 100 and enabled the mapping of a billion stars.
Today, the catalogue most often used is USNO-B1.0, an all-sky catalogue that tracks proper motions, positions, magnitudes and other characteristics for over one billion stellar objects. During the past 50 years, 7,435 Schmidt camera plates were used to complete several sky surveys that make the data in USNO-B1.0 accurate to within 0.2 arcsec.

==Applications==
Apart from the fundamental function of providing astronomers with a reference frame to report their observations in, astrometry is also fundamental for fields like celestial mechanics, stellar dynamics and galactic astronomy. In observational astronomy, astrometric techniques help identify stellar objects by their unique motions. It is instrumental for keeping time, in that UTC is essentially the atomic time synchronized to Earth&#x27;s rotation by means of exact astronomical observations. Astrometry is an important step in the cosmic distance ladder because it establishes parallax distance estimates for stars in the Milky Way.

Astrometry has also been used to support claims of extrasolar planet detection by measuring the displacement the proposed planets cause in their parent star&#x27;s apparent position on the sky, due to their mutual orbit around the center of mass of the system. Astrometry is more accurate in space missions that are not affected by the distorting effects of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. NASA&#x27;s planned Space Interferometry Mission (SIM PlanetQuest) (now cancelled) was to utilize astrometric techniques to detect terrestrial planets orbiting 200 or so of the nearest solar-type stars. The European Space Agency&#x27;s Gaia Mission, launched in 2013, applies astrometric techniques in its stellar census. In addition to the detection of exoplanets, it can also be used to determine their mass.

Astrometric measurements are used by astrophysicists to constrain certain models in celestial mechanics. By measuring the velocities of pulsars, it is possible to put a limit on the asymmetry of supernova explosions. Also, astrometric results are used to determine the distribution of dark matter in the galaxy.

Astronomers use astrometric techniques for the tracking of near-Earth objects. Astrometry is responsible for the detection of many record-breaking Solar System objects. To find such objects astrometrically, astronomers use telescopes to survey the sky and large-area cameras to take pictures at various determined intervals. By studying these images, they can detect Solar System objects by their movements relative to the background stars, which remain fixed. Once a movement per unit time is observed, astronomers compensate for the parallax caused by Earth&#x27;s motion during this time and the heliocentric distance to this object is calculated. Using this distance and other photographs, more information about the object, including its orbital elements, can be obtained. Asteroid impact avoidance is among the purposes.

Quaoar and Sedna are two trans-Neptunian dwarf planets discovered in this way by Michael E. Brown and others at Caltech using the Palomar Observatory&#x27;s Samuel Oschin telescope of and the Palomar-Quest large-area CCD camera. The ability of astronomers to track the positions and movements of such celestial bodies is crucial to the understanding of the Solar System and its interrelated past, present, and future with others in the Universe.

== Statistics ==

A fundamental aspect of astrometry is error correction. Various factors introduce errors into the measurement of stellar positions, including atmospheric conditions, imperfections in the instruments and errors by the observer or the measuring instruments. Many of these errors can be reduced by various techniques, such as through instrument improvements and compensations to the data. The results are then analyzed using statistical methods to compute data estimates and error ranges.

<text>Athena or Athene, often given the epithet Pallas, is an ancient Greek goddess associated with wisdom, warfare, and handicraft who was later syncretized with the Roman goddess Minerva. Athena was regarded as the patron and protectress of various cities across Greece, particularly the city of Athens, from which she most likely received her name. The Parthenon on the Acropolis of Athens is dedicated to her. Her major symbols include owls, olive trees, snakes, and the Gorgoneion. In art, she is generally depicted wearing a helmet and holding a spear.

From her origin as an Aegean palace goddess, Athena was closely associated with the city. She was known as &quot;Polias&quot; and &quot;Poliouchos&quot; (both derived from &quot;polis&quot;, meaning &quot;city-state&quot;), and her temples were usually located atop the fortified acropolis in the central part of the city. The Parthenon on the Athenian Acropolis is dedicated to her, along with numerous other temples and monuments. As the patron of craft and weaving, Athena was known as &quot;Ergane&quot;. She was also a warrior goddess, and was believed to lead soldiers into battle as &quot;Athena Promachos&quot;. Her main festival in Athens was the Panathenaia, which was celebrated during the month of Hekatombaion in midsummer and was the most important festival on the Athenian calendar.

In Greek mythology, Athena was believed to have been born from the forehead of her father Zeus. In some versions of the story, Athena has no mother and is born from Zeus&#x27; forehead by parthenogenesis. In others, such as Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, Zeus swallows his consort Metis, who was pregnant with Athena; in this version, Athena is first born within Zeus and then escapes from his body through his forehead. In the founding myth of Athens, Athena bested Poseidon in a competition over patronage of the city by creating the first olive tree. She was known as &quot;Athena Parthenos&quot; &quot;Athena the Virgin&quot;. In one archaic Attic myth, the god Hephaestus tried and failed to rape her, resulting in Gaia giving birth to Erichthonius, an important Athenian founding hero. Athena was the patron goddess of heroic endeavor; she was believed to have aided the heroes Perseus, Heracles, Bellerophon, and Jason. Along with Aphrodite and Hera, Athena was one of the three goddesses whose feud resulted in the beginning of the Trojan War.

Athena plays an active role in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, in which she assists the Achaeans and, in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, she is the divine counselor to Odysseus. In the later writings of the Roman poet Ovid, Athena was said to have competed against the mortal Arachne in a weaving competition, afterward transforming Arachne into the first spider; Ovid also describes how Athena transformed her priestess Medusa and the latter&#x27;s sisters, Stheno and Euryale, into the Gorgons after witnessing the young woman being raped by Poseidon in the goddess&#x27;s temple. Since the Renaissance, Athena has become an international symbol of wisdom, the arts, and classical learning. Western artists and allegorists have often used Athena as a symbol of freedom and democracy.

==Etymology==
Athena is associated with the city of Athens. The name of the city in ancient Greek is (), a plural toponym, designating the place where—according to myth—she presided over the &quot;Athenai&quot;, a sisterhood devoted to her worship. In ancient times, scholars argued whether Athena was named after Athens or Athens after Athena. Now scholars generally agree that the goddess takes her name from the city; the ending -&quot;ene&quot; is common in names of locations, but rare for personal names. Testimonies from different cities in ancient Greece attest that similar city goddesses were worshipped in other cities and, like Athena, took their names from the cities where they were worshipped. For example, in Mycenae there was a goddess called Mykene, whose sisterhood was known as &quot;Mykenai&quot;, whereas at Thebes an analogous deity was called Thebe, and the city was known under the plural form &quot;Thebai&quot; (or Thebes, in English, where the &#x27;s&#x27; is the plural formation). The name &quot;Athenai&quot; is likely of Pre-Greek origin because it contains the presumably Pre-Greek morpheme &quot;*-ān-&quot;.

In his dialogue &quot;Cratylus&quot;, the ancient Greek philosopher Plato (428–347 BC) gives some rather imaginative etymologies of Athena&#x27;s name, based on the theories of the ancient Athenians and his etymological speculations:

Thus, Plato believed that Athena&#x27;s name was derived from Greek , —which the later Greeks rationalised as from the deity&#x27;s (, ) mind (, ). The second-century AD orator Aelius Aristides attempted to derive natural symbols from the etymological roots of Athena&#x27;s names to be &quot;aether&quot;, &quot;air&quot;, &quot;earth&quot;, and &quot;moon&quot;.

==Origins==
Athena was originally the Aegean goddess of the palace, who presided over household crafts and protected the king. A single Mycenaean Greek inscription appears at Knossos in the Linear B tablets from the Late Minoan II-era &quot;Room of the Chariot Tablets&quot;; these comprise the earliest Linear B archive anywhere. Although &quot;Athana potnia&quot; is often translated as &quot;Mistress Athena&quot;, it could also mean &quot;the &quot;Potnia&quot; of Athana&quot;, or &quot;the Lady of Athens&quot;. However, any connection to the city of Athens in the Knossos inscription is uncertain. A sign series appears in the still undeciphered corpus of Linear A tablets, written in the unclassified Minoan language. This could be connected with the Linear B Mycenaean expressions and or (&quot;Diwia&quot;, &quot;of Zeus&quot; or, possibly, related to a homonymous goddess), resulting in a translation &quot;Athena of Zeus&quot; or &quot;divine Athena&quot;. Similarly, in the Greek mythology and epic tradition, Athena figures as a daughter of Zeus (; &quot;cfr.&quot; Dyeus). However, the inscription quoted seems to be very similar to &quot;&quot;, quoted as SY Za 1 by Jan Best. Best translates the initial , which is recurrent in line beginnings, as &quot;I have given&quot;.

A Mycenean fresco depicts two women extending their hands towards a central figure, who is covered by an enormous figure-eight shield; this may depict the warrior-goddess with her &quot;palladium&quot;, or her palladium in an aniconic representation. In the &quot;Procession Fresco&quot; at Knossos, which was reconstructed by the Mycenaeans, two rows of figures carrying vessels seem to meet in front of a central figure, which is probably the Minoan precursor to Athena. The early twentieth-century scholar Martin Persson Nilsson argued that the Minoan snake goddess figurines are early representations of Athena.

Nilsson and others have claimed that, in early times, Athena was either an owl herself or a bird goddess in general. In the third book of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, she takes the form of a sea-eagle. Proponents of this view argue that she dropped her prophylactic owl mask before she lost her wings. &quot;Athena, by the time she appears in art,&quot; Jane Ellen Harrison remarks, &quot;has completely shed her animal form, has reduced the shapes she once wore of snake and bird to attributes, but occasionally in black-figure vase-paintings she still appears with wings.&quot;

It is generally agreed that the cult of Athena preserves some aspects of the Proto-Indo-European transfunctional goddess. The cult of Athena may have also been influenced by those of Near Eastern warrior goddesses such as the East Semitic Ishtar and the Ugaritic Anat, both of whom were often portrayed bearing arms. Classical scholar Charles Penglase notes that Athena resembles Inanna in her role as a &quot;terrifying warrior goddess&quot; and that both goddesses were closely linked with creation. Athena&#x27;s birth from the head of Zeus may be derived from the earlier Sumerian myth of Inanna&#x27;s descent into and return from the Underworld.

Plato notes that the citizens of Sais in Egypt worshipped a goddess known as Neith, whom he identifies with Athena. Neith was the ancient Egyptian goddess of war and hunting, who was also associated with weaving; her worship began during the Egyptian Pre-Dynastic period. In Greek mythology, Athena was reported to have visited mythological sites in North Africa, including Libya&#x27;s Triton River and the Phlegraean plain. Based on these similarities, the Sinologist Martin Bernal created the &quot;Black Athena&quot; hypothesis, which claimed that Neith was brought to Greece from Egypt, along with &quot;an enormous number of features of civilization and culture in the third and second millennia&quot;. The &quot;Black Athena&quot; hypothesis stirred up widespread controversy near the end of the twentieth century, but it has now been widely rejected by modern scholars.
==Epithets and attributes==

Athena was also the goddess of peace. 

In a similar manner to her patronage of various activities and Greek cities, Athena was thought to be a &quot;protector of heroes&quot; and a &quot;patron of art&quot; and various local traditions related to the arts and handicrafts.

Athena was known as &quot;Atrytone&quot; ( &quot;the Unwearying&quot;), &quot;Parthenos&quot; ( &quot;Virgin&quot;), and &quot;Promachos&quot; ( &quot;she who fights in front&quot;). The epithet &quot;Polias&quot; (Πολιάς &quot;of the city&quot;), refers to Athena&#x27;s role as protectress of the city. The epithet &quot;Ergane&quot; (Εργάνη &quot;the Industrious&quot;) pointed her out as the patron of craftsmen and artisans. Burkert notes that the Athenians sometimes simply called Athena &quot;the Goddess&quot;, &quot;hē theós&quot; (ἡ θεός), certainly an ancient title. After serving as the judge at the trial of Orestes in which he was acquitted of having murdered his mother Clytemnestra, Athena won the epithet &quot;Areia&quot; (Αρεία). Some have described Athena, along with the goddesses Hestia and Artemis as being asexual, this is mainly supported by the fact that in the Homeric Hymns, 5, &quot;To Aphrodite&quot;, where Aphrodite is described as having &quot;no power&quot; over the three goddesses.

Athena was sometimes given the epithet &quot;Hippia&quot; (Ἵππια &quot;of the horses&quot;, &quot;equestrian&quot;), referring to her invention of the bit, bridle, chariot, and wagon. The Greek geographer Pausanias mentions in his &quot;Guide to Greece&quot; that the temple of Athena &quot;Chalinitis&quot; (&quot;the bridler&quot;) in Corinth was located near the tomb of Medea&#x27;s children. Other epithets include Ageleia, Itonia and &quot;Aethyia&quot;, under which she was worshiped in Megara. She was worshipped as Assesia in Assesos. The word &quot;aíthyia&quot; () signifies a &quot;diver&quot;, also some diving bird species (possibly the shearwater) and figuratively, a &quot;ship&quot;, so the name must reference Athena teaching the art of shipbuilding or navigation. In a temple at Phrixa in Elis, reportedly built by Clymenus, she was known as &quot;Cydonia&quot; (Κυδωνία). Pausanias wrote that at Buporthmus there was a sanctuary of Athena Promachorma (Προμαχόρμα), meaning &quot;protector of the anchorage&quot;.

The Greek biographer Plutarch describes Pericles&#x27;s dedication of a statue to her as &quot;Athena Hygieia&quot; (Ὑγίεια, &quot;Health&quot;) after she inspired, in a dream, his successful treatment of a man injured during the construction of the gateway to the Acropolis.
&quot;Mechanitis&quot; (Μηχανῖτις), meaning skilled in inventing, was one of the epithets of her.

At Athens there is the temple of Athena &quot;Phratria&quot;, as patron of a phratry, in the Ancient Agora of Athens.

===Pallas Athena===

Athena&#x27;s epithet &quot;Pallas&quot; – her most renowned one – is derived either from , meaning &quot;to brandish [as a weapon]&quot;, or, more likely, from and related words, meaning &quot;youth, young woman&quot;. On this topic, Walter Burkert says &quot;she is the Pallas of Athens, &quot;Pallas Athenaie&quot;, just as Hera of Argos is &quot;Here Argeie&quot;&quot;. In later times, after the original meaning of the name had been forgotten, the Greeks invented myths to explain its origins, such as those reported by the Epicurean philosopher Philodemus and the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; of Pseudo-Apollodorus, which claim that &quot;Pallas&quot; was originally a separate entity, whom Athena had slain in combat.

In one version of the myth, Pallas was the daughter of the sea-god Triton, and she and Athena were childhood friends. Zeus one day watched Athena and Pallas have a friendly sparring match. Not wanting his daughter to lose, Zeus flapped his aegis to distract Pallas, whom Athena accidentally impaled. Distraught over what she had done, Athena took the name Pallas for herself as a sign of her grief and tribute to her friend and Zeus gave her the aegis as an apology. In another version of the story, Pallas was a Giant; Athena slew him during the Gigantomachy and flayed off his skin to make her cloak, which she wore as a victory trophy. In an alternative variation of the same myth, Pallas was instead Athena&#x27;s father, who attempted to assault his own daughter, causing Athena to kill him and take his skin as a trophy.

The &quot;palladium&quot; was a statue of Athena that was said to have stood in her temple on the Trojan Acropolis. Athena was said to have carved the statue herself in the likeness of her dead friend Pallas. The statue had special talisman-like properties and it was thought that, as long as it was in the city, Troy could never fall. When the Greeks captured Troy, Cassandra, the daughter of Priam, clung to the palladium for protection, but Ajax the Lesser violently tore her away from it and dragged her over to the other captives. Athena was infuriated by this violation of her protection. Although Agamemnon attempted to placate her anger with sacrifices, Athena sent a storm at Cape Kaphereos to destroy almost the entire Greek fleet and scatter all of the surviving ships across the Aegean.

=== &quot;Glaukopis&quot; ===
In Homer&#x27;s epic works, Athena&#x27;s most common epithet is &#x27; (), which usually is translated as, &quot;bright-eyed&quot; or &quot;with gleaming eyes&quot;. The word is a combination of &#x27; (, meaning &quot;gleaming, silvery&quot;, and later, &quot;bluish-green&quot; or &quot;gray&quot;) and &quot;&quot; (, &quot;eye, face&quot;). 

The word &quot;&quot; (, &quot;little owl&quot;) is from the same root, presumably according to some, because of the bird&#x27;s own distinctive eyes. Athena was associated with the owl from very early on; in archaic images, she is frequently depicted with an owl perched on her hand. Through its association with Athena, the owl evolved into the national mascot of the Athenians and eventually became a symbol of wisdom.

=== &quot;Tritogeneia&quot; ===
In the &quot;Iliad&quot; (4.514), the &quot;Odyssey&quot; (3.378), the &quot;Homeric Hymns&quot;, and in Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, Athena is also given the curious epithet &quot;Tritogeneia&quot; (Τριτογένεια), whose significance remains unclear. It could mean various things, including &quot;Triton-born&quot;, perhaps indicating that the homonymous sea-deity was her parent according to some early myths. One myth relates the foster father relationship of this Triton towards the half-orphan Athena, whom he raised alongside his own daughter Pallas. Kerényi suggests that &quot;Tritogeneia did not mean that she came into the world on any particular river or lake, but that she was born of the water itself; for the name Triton seems to be associated with water generally.&quot; In Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, Athena is occasionally referred to as &quot;Tritonia&quot;.

Another possible meaning may be &quot;triple-born&quot; or &quot;third-born&quot;, which may refer to a triad or to her status as the third daughter of Zeus or the fact she was born from Metis, Zeus, and herself; various legends list her as being the first child after Artemis and Apollo, though other legends identify her as Zeus&#x27; first child. Several scholars have suggested a connection to the Rigvedic god Trita, who was sometimes grouped in a body of three mythological poets. Michael Janda has connected the myth of Trita to the scene in the &quot;Iliad&quot; in which the &quot;three brothers&quot; Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades divide the world between them, receiving the &quot;broad sky&quot;, the sea, and the underworld respectively. Janda further connects the myth of Athena being born of the head (i. e. the uppermost part) of Zeus, understanding &quot;Trito-&quot; (which perhaps originally meant &quot;the third&quot;) as another word for &quot;the sky&quot;. In Janda&#x27;s analysis of Indo-European mythology, this heavenly sphere is also associated with the mythological body of water surrounding the inhabited world (&quot;cfr.&quot; Triton&#x27;s mother, Amphitrite).

Yet another possible meaning is mentioned in Diogenes Laertius&#x27; biography of Democritus, that Athena was called &quot;Tritogeneia&quot; because three things, on which all mortal life depends, come from her.

===Cult and patronages===
=== Panhellenic and Athenian cult ===

In her aspect of &quot;Athena Polias&quot;, Athena was venerated as the goddess of the city and the protectress of the citadel. In Athens, the Plynteria, or &quot;Feast of the Bath&quot;, was observed every year at the end of the month of Thargelion. The festival lasted for five days. During this period, the priestesses of Athena, or &quot;plyntrídes&quot;, performed a cleansing ritual within the Erechtheion, a sanctuary devoted to Athena and Poseidon. Here Athena&#x27;s statue was undressed, her clothes washed, and body purified. Athena was worshipped at festivals such as Chalceia as &quot;Athena Ergane&quot;, the patroness of various crafts, especially weaving. She was also the patron of metalworkers and was believed to aid in the forging of armor and weapons. During the late fifth century BC, the role of goddess of philosophy became a major aspect of Athena&#x27;s cult.

As &quot;Athena Promachos&quot;, she was believed to lead soldiers into battle. Athena represented the disciplined, strategic side of war, in contrast to her brother Ares, the patron of violence, bloodlust, and slaughter—&quot;the raw force of war&quot;. Athena was believed to only support those fighting for a just cause and was thought to view war primarily as a means to resolve conflict. The Greeks regarded Athena with much higher esteem than Ares. Athena was especially worshipped in this role during the festivals of the Panathenaea and Pamboeotia, both of which prominently featured displays of athletic and military prowess. As the patroness of heroes and warriors, Athena was believed to favor those who used cunning and intelligence rather than brute strength.

In her aspect as a warrior maiden, Athena was known as &quot;Parthenos&quot; ( &quot;virgin&quot;), because, like her fellow goddesses Artemis and Hestia, she was believed to remain perpetually a virgin. Athena&#x27;s most famous temple, the Parthenon on the Athenian Acropolis, takes its name from this title. According to Karl Kerényi, a scholar of Greek mythology, the name &quot;Parthenos&quot; is not merely an observation of Athena&#x27;s virginity, but also a recognition of her role as enforcer of rules of sexual modesty and ritual mystery. Even beyond recognition, the Athenians allotted the goddess value based on this pureness of virginity, which they upheld as a rudiment of female behavior. Kerényi&#x27;s study and theory of Athena explains her virginal epithet as a result of her relationship to her father Zeus and a vital, cohesive piece of her character throughout the ages. This role is expressed in several stories about Athena. Marinus of Neapolis reports that when Christians removed the statue of the goddess from the Parthenon, a beautiful woman appeared in a dream to Proclus, a devotee of Athena, and announced that the &quot;Athenian Lady&quot; wished to dwell with him.

Athena was also credited with creating the pebble-based form of divination. Those pebbles were called &quot;thriai&quot;, which was also the collective name of a group of nymphs with prophetic powers. Her half-brother Apollo, however, angered and spiteful at the practitioners of an art rival to his own, complained to their father Zeus about it, with the pretext that many people took to casting pebbles, but few actually were true prophets. Zeus, sympathizing with Apollo&#x27;s grievances, discredited the pebble divination by rendering the pebbles useless. Apollo&#x27;s words became the basis of an ancient Greek idiom.

=== Regional cults ===
Athena was not only the patron goddess of Athens, but also other cities, including Pergamon, Argos, Sparta, Gortyn, Lindos, and Larisa. The various cults of Athena were all branches of her panhellenic cult and often proctored various initiation rites of Grecian youth, such as the passage into citizenship by young men or the passage of young women into marriage. These cults were portals of a uniform socialization, even beyond mainland Greece. Athena was frequently equated with Aphaea, a local goddess of the island of Aegina, originally from Crete and also associated with Artemis and the nymph Britomartis. In Arcadia, she was assimilated with the ancient goddess Alea and worshiped as Athena Alea. Sanctuaries dedicated to Athena Alea were located in the Laconian towns of Mantineia and Tegea. The temple of Athena Alea in Tegea was an important religious center of ancient Greece. The geographer Pausanias was informed that the &quot;temenos&quot; had been founded by Aleus.

Athena had a major temple on the Spartan Acropolis, where she was venerated as Poliouchos and &quot;Khalkíoikos&quot; (&quot;of the Brazen House&quot;, often latinized as &quot;Chalcioecus&quot;). This epithet may refer to the fact that cult statue held there may have been made of bronze, that the walls of the temple itself may have been made of bronze, or that Athena was the patron of metal-workers. Bells made of terracotta and bronze were used in Sparta as part of Athena&#x27;s cult. An Ionic-style temple to Athena Polias was built at Priene in the fourth century BC. It was designed by Pytheos of Priene, the same architect who designed the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus. The temple was dedicated by Alexander the Great and an inscription from the temple declaring his dedication is now held in the British Museum. She was worshipped as &quot;Athena Asia&quot; in Colchis – supposedly on an account of a nearby mountain with that name – from which her worship was believed to have been brought by Castor and Pollux to Laconia, where a temple was built to her at Las.

In Pergamon, Athena was thought to have been a god of the cosmos and the aspects of it that aided Pergamon and its fate.
==Mythology==
===Birth===
She was the daughter of Zeus, produced without a mother, and emerged full-grown from his forehead. There was an alternate story that Zeus swallowed Metis, the goddess of counsel, while she was pregnant with Athena and when she was fully grown she emerged from Zeus&#x27; forehead. Being the favorite child of Zeus, she had great power.
In the classical Olympian pantheon, Athena was regarded as the favorite child of Zeus, born fully armed from his forehead. The story of her birth comes in several versions. The earliest mention is in Book V of the &quot;Iliad&quot;, when Ares accuses Zeus of being biased in favor of Athena because &quot;autos egeinao&quot; (literally &quot;you fathered her&quot;, but probably intended as &quot;you gave birth to her&quot;).
She was essentially urban and civilized, the antithesis in many respects of Artemis, goddess of the outdoors. Athena was probably a pre-Hellenic goddess and was later taken over by the Greeks.
In the version recounted by Hesiod in his &quot;Theogony&quot;, Zeus married the goddess Metis, who is described as the &quot;wisest among gods and mortal men&quot;, and engaged in sexual intercourse with her. After learning that Metis was pregnant, however, he became afraid that the unborn offspring would try to overthrow him, because Gaia and Ouranos had prophesied that Metis would bear children wiser than their father. In order to prevent this, Zeus tricked Metis into letting him swallow her, but it was too late because Metis had already conceived. A later account of the story from the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; of Pseudo-Apollodorus, written in the second century AD, makes Metis Zeus&#x27;s unwilling sexual partner, rather than his wife. According to this version of the story, Metis transformed into many different shapes in effort to escape Zeus, but Zeus successfully raped her and swallowed her.

After swallowing Metis, Zeus took six more wives in succession until he married his seventh and present wife, Hera. Then Zeus experienced an enormous headache. He was in such pain that he ordered someone (either Prometheus, Hephaestus, Hermes, Ares, or Palaemon, depending on the sources examined) to cleave his head open with the &quot;labrys&quot;, the double-headed Minoan axe. Athena leaped from Zeus&#x27;s head, fully grown and armed. The &quot;First Homeric Hymn to Athena&quot; states in lines 9–16 that the gods were awestruck by Athena&#x27;s appearance and even Helios, the god of the sun, stopped his chariot in the sky. Pindar, in his &quot;Seventh Olympian Ode&quot;, states that she &quot;cried aloud with a mighty shout&quot; and that &quot;the Sky and mother Earth shuddered before her&quot;.

Hesiod states that Hera was so annoyed at Zeus for having given birth to a child on his own that she conceived and bore Hephaestus by herself, but in &quot;Imagines&quot; 2. 27 (trans. Fairbanks), the third-century AD Greek rhetorician Philostratus the Elder writes that Hera &quot;rejoices&quot; at Athena&#x27;s birth &quot;as though Athena were her daughter also&quot;. The second-century AD Christian apologist Justin Martyr takes issue with those pagans who erect at springs images of Kore, whom he interprets as Athena: &quot;They said that Athena was the daughter of Zeus not from intercourse, but when the god had in mind the making of a world through a word (&quot;logos&quot;) his first thought was Athena.&quot; According to a version of the story in a scholium on the &quot;Iliad&quot; (found nowhere else), when Zeus swallowed Metis, she was pregnant with Athena by the Cyclops Brontes. The &quot;Etymologicum Magnum&quot; instead deems Athena the daughter of the Daktyl Itonos. Fragments attributed by the Christian Eusebius of Caesarea to the semi-legendary Phoenician historian Sanchuniathon, which Eusebius thought had been written before the Trojan War, make Athena instead the daughter of Cronus, a king of Byblos who visited &quot;the inhabitable world&quot; and bequeathed Attica to Athena.

===Lady of Athens===
In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, Athena, as a war goddess, inspired and fought alongside the Greek heroes; her aid was synonymous with military prowess. Also in the Iliad, Zeus, the chief god, specifically assigned the sphere of war to Ares, the god of war, and Athena. Athena&#x27;s moral and military superiority to Ares derived in part from the fact that she represented the intellectual and civilized side of war and the virtues of justice and skill, whereas Ares represented mere blood lust. Her superiority also derived in part from the vastly greater variety and importance of her functions and the patriotism of Homer&#x27;s predecessors, Ares being of foreign origin. In the Iliad, Athena was the divine form of the heroic, martial ideal: she personified excellence in close combat, victory, and glory. The qualities that led to victory were found on the aegis, or breastplate, that Athena wore when she went to war: fear, strife, defense, and assault. Athena appears in Homer&#x27;s Odyssey as the tutelary deity of Odysseus, and myths from later sources portray her similarly as the helper of Perseus and Heracles (Hercules). As the guardian of the welfare of kings, Athena became the goddess of good counsel, prudent restraint and practical insight, and war.
In a founding myth reported by Pseudo-Apollodorus, Athena competed with Poseidon for the patronage of Athens. They agreed that each would give the Athenians one gift and that Cecrops, the king of Athens, would determine which gift was better. Poseidon struck the ground with his trident and a salt water spring sprang up; this gave the Athenians access to trade and water. Athens at its height was a significant sea power, defeating the Persian fleet at the Battle of Salamis—but the water was salty and undrinkable. In an alternative version of the myth from Vergil&#x27;s &quot;Georgics&quot;, Poseidon instead gave the Athenians the first horse. Athena offered the first domesticated olive tree. Cecrops accepted this gift and declared Athena the patron goddess of Athens. The olive tree brought wood, oil, and food, and became a symbol of Athenian economic prosperity. Robert Graves was of the opinion that &quot;Poseidon&#x27;s attempts to take possession of certain cities are political myths&quot;, which reflect the conflict between matriarchal and patriarchal religions.

Afterwards, Poseidon was so angry over his defeat that he sent one of his sons, Halirrhothius, to cut down the tree. But as he swung his axe, he missed his aim and it fell in himself, killing him. This was supposedly the origin of calling Athena&#x27;s sacred olive tree &quot;moria&quot;, for Halirrhotius&#x27;s attempt at revenge proved fatal (&quot;moros&quot; in Greek). Poseidon in fury accused Ares of murder, and the matter was eventually settled on the Areopagus (&quot;hill of Ares&quot;) in favour of Ares, which was thereafter named after the event.

Pseudo-Apollodorus records an archaic legend, which claims that Hephaestus once attempted to rape Athena, but she pushed him away, causing him to ejaculate on her thigh. Athena wiped the semen off using a tuft of wool, which she tossed into the dust, impregnating Gaia and causing her to give birth to Erichthonius. Athena adopted Erichthonius as her son and raised him. The &quot;Fabulae&quot;, a work of Roman mythography attributed to Gaius Julius Hyginus, records a similar story in which Hephaestus demanded Zeus to let him marry Athena since he was the one who had smashed open Zeus&#x27;s skull, allowing Athena to be born. Zeus agreed to this and Hephaestus and Athena were married, but, when Hephaestus was about to consummate the union, Athena vanished from the bridal bed, causing him to ejaculate on the floor, thus impregnating Gaia with Erichthonius.

The geographer Pausanias records that Athena placed the infant Erichthonius into a small chest (&quot;cista&quot;), which she entrusted to the care of the three daughters of Cecrops: Herse, Pandrosos, and Aglauros of Athens. She warned the three sisters not to open the chest, but did not explain to them why or what was in it. Aglauros, and possibly one of the other sisters, opened the chest. Differing reports say that they either found that the child itself was a serpent, that it was guarded by a serpent, that it was guarded by two serpents, or that it had the legs of a serpent. In Pausanias&#x27;s story, the two sisters were driven mad by the sight of the chest&#x27;s contents and hurled themselves off the Acropolis, dying instantly, but an Attic vase painting shows them being chased by the serpent off the edge of the cliff instead.

Erichthonius was one of the most important founding heroes of Athens and the legend of the daughters of Cecrops was a cult myth linked to the rituals of the Arrhephoria festival. Pausanias records that, during the Arrhephoria, two young girls known as the &quot;Arrhephoroi&quot;, who lived near the temple of Athena Polias, would be given hidden objects by the priestess of Athena, which they would carry on their heads down a natural underground passage. They would leave the objects they had been given at the bottom of the passage and take another set of hidden objects, which they would carry on their heads back up to the temple. The ritual was performed in the dead of night and no one, not even the priestess, knew what the objects were. The serpent in the story may be the same one depicted coiled at Athena&#x27;s feet in Pheidias&#x27;s famous statue of the &quot;Athena Parthenos&quot; in the Parthenon. Many of the surviving sculptures of Athena show this serpent.

Herodotus records that a serpent lived in a crevice on the north side of the summit of the Athenian Acropolis and that the Athenians left a honey cake for it each month as an offering. On the eve of the Second Persian invasion of Greece in 480 BC, the serpent did not eat the honey cake and the Athenians interpreted it as a sign that Athena herself had abandoned them. Another version of the myth of the Athenian maidens is told in &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; by the Roman poet Ovid (43 BC17 AD); in this late variant Hermes falls in love with Herse. Herse, Aglaulus, and Pandrosus go to the temple to offer sacrifices to Athena. Hermes demands help from Aglaulus to seduce Herse. Aglaulus demands money in exchange. Hermes gives her the money the sisters have already offered to Athena. As punishment for Aglaulus&#x27;s greed, Athena asks the goddess Envy to make Aglaulus jealous of Herse. When Hermes arrives to seduce Herse, Aglaulus stands in his way instead of helping him as she had agreed. He turns her to stone.

Athena gave her favour to an Attic girl named Myrsine, a chaste girl who outdid all her fellow athletes in both the palaestra and the race. Out of envy, the other athletes murdered her, but Athena took pity in her and transformed her dead body into a myrtle, a plant thereafter as favoured by her as the olive was. An almost exact story was said about another girl, Elaea, who transformed into an olive, Athena&#x27;s sacred tree.

===Patron of heroes===
According to Pseudo-Apollodorus&#x27;s &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;, Athena advised Argos, the builder of the &quot;Argo&quot;, the ship on which the hero Jason and his band of Argonauts sailed, and aided in the ship&#x27;s construction. Pseudo-Apollodorus also records that Athena guided the hero Perseus in his quest to behead Medusa. She and Hermes, the god of travelers, appeared to Perseus after he set off on his quest and gifted him with tools he would need to kill the Gorgon. Athena lent Perseus her polished bronze shield to view Medusa&#x27;s reflection without becoming petrified himself. Hermes lent Perseus his harpe to behead Medusa with. When Perseus swung the blade to behead Medusa, Athena guided it, allowing the blade to cut the Gorgon&#x27;s head clean off. According to Pindar&#x27;s &quot;Thirteenth Olympian Ode&quot;, Athena helped the hero Bellerophon tame the winged horse Pegasus by giving him a bit.

In ancient Greek art, Athena is frequently shown aiding the hero Heracles. She appears in four of the twelve metopes on the Temple of Zeus at Olympia depicting Heracles&#x27;s Twelve Labors, including the first, in which she passively watches him slay the Nemean lion, and the tenth, in which she is shown actively helping him hold up the sky. She is presented as his &quot;stern ally&quot;, but also the &quot;gentle ... acknowledger of his achievements&quot;. Artistic depictions of Heracles&#x27;s apotheosis show Athena driving him to Mount Olympus in her chariot and presenting him to Zeus for his deification. In Aeschylus&#x27;s tragedy &quot;Orestes&quot;, Athena intervenes to save Orestes from the wrath of the Erinyes and presides over his trial for the murder of his mother Clytemnestra. When half the jury votes to acquit and the other half votes to convict, Athena casts the deciding vote to acquit Orestes and declares that, from then on, whenever a jury is tied, the defendant shall always be acquitted.

In &quot;The Odyssey&quot;, Odysseus&#x27; cunning and shrewd nature quickly wins Athena&#x27;s favour. For the first part of the poem, however, she largely is confined to aiding him only from &quot;afar&quot;, mainly by implanting thoughts in his head during his journey home from Troy. Her guiding actions reinforce her role as the &quot;protectress of heroes&quot;, or, as mythologian Walter Friedrich Otto dubbed her, the &quot;goddess of nearness&quot;, due to her mentoring and motherly probing. It is not until he washes up on the shore of the island of the Phaeacians, where Nausicaa is washing her clothes that Athena arrives personally to provide more tangible assistance. She appears in Nausicaa&#x27;s dreams to ensure that the princess rescues Odysseus and plays a role in his eventual escort to Ithaca. Athena appears to Odysseus upon his arrival, disguised as a herdsman; she initially lies and tells him that Penelope, his wife, has remarried and that he is believed to be dead, but Odysseus lies back to her, employing skillful prevarications to protect himself. Impressed by his resolve and shrewdness, she reveals herself and tells him what he needs to know to win back his kingdom. She disguises him as an elderly beggar so that he will not be recognized by the suitors or Penelope, and helps him to defeat the suitors. Athena also appears to Odysseus&#x27;s son Telemachus. Her actions lead him to travel around to Odysseus&#x27;s comrades and ask about his father. He hears stories about some of Odysseus&#x27;s journey. Athena&#x27;s push for Telemachus&#x27;s journey helps him grow into the man role, that his father once held. She also plays a role in ending the resultant feud against the suitors&#x27; relatives. She instructs Laertes to throw his spear and to kill Eupeithes, the father of Antinous.

===Punishment myths===
The Gorgoneion appears to have originated as an apotropaic symbol intended to ward off evil. In a late myth invented to explain the origins of the Gorgon, Medusa is described as having been a young priestess who served in the temple of Athena in Athens. Poseidon lusted after Medusa, and raped her in the temple of Athena, refusing to allow her vow of chastity to stand in his way. Upon discovering the desecration of her temple, Athena transformed Medusa into a hideous monster with serpents for hair whose gaze would turn any mortal to stone.

In his &quot;Twelfth Pythian Ode&quot;, Pindar recounts the story of how Athena invented the &quot;aulos&quot;, a kind of flute, in imitation of the lamentations of Medusa&#x27;s sisters, the Gorgons, after she was beheaded by the hero Perseus. According to Pindar, Athena gave the aulos to mortals as a gift. Later, the comic playwright Melanippides of Melos ( 480–430 BC) embellished the story in his comedy &quot;Marsyas&quot;, claiming that Athena looked in the mirror while she was playing the aulos and saw how blowing into it puffed up her cheeks and made her look silly, so she threw the aulos away and cursed it so that whoever picked it up would meet an awful death. The aulos was picked up by the satyr Marsyas, who was later killed by Apollo for his hubris. Later, this version of the story became accepted as canonical and the Athenian sculptor Myron created a group of bronze sculptures based on it, which was installed before the western front of the Parthenon in around 440 BC.

A myth told by the early third-century BC Hellenistic poet Callimachus in his &quot;Hymn&quot; 5 begins with Athena bathing in a spring on Mount Helicon at midday with one of her favorite companions, the nymph Chariclo. Chariclo&#x27;s son Tiresias happened to be hunting on the same mountain and came to the spring searching for water. He inadvertently saw Athena naked, so she struck him blind to ensure he would never again see what man was not intended to see. Chariclo intervened on her son&#x27;s behalf and begged Athena to have mercy. Athena replied that she could not restore Tiresias&#x27;s eyesight, so, instead, she gave him the ability to understand the language of the birds and thus foretell the future.

Myrmex was a clever and chaste Attic girl who became quickly a favourite of Athena. However, when Athena invented the plough, Myrmex went to the Atticans and told them that it was in fact her own invention. Hurt by the girl&#x27;s betrayal, Athena transformed her into the small insect bearing her name, the ant.

The fable of Arachne appears in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; (8 AD) (vi.5–54 and 129–145), which is nearly the only extant source for the legend. The story does not appear to have been well known prior to Ovid&#x27;s rendition of it and the only earlier reference to it is a brief allusion in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Georgics&quot;, (29 BC) (iv, 246) that does not mention Arachne by name. According to Ovid, Arachne (whose name means &quot;spider&quot; in ancient Greek) was the daughter of a famous dyer in Tyrian purple in Hypaipa of Lydia, and a weaving student of Athena. She became so conceited of her skill as a weaver that she began claiming that her skill was greater than that of Athena herself. Athena gave Arachne a chance to redeem herself by assuming the form of an old woman and warning Arachne not to offend the deities. Arachne scoffed and wished for a weaving contest, so she could prove her skill.

Athena wove the scene of her victory over Poseidon in the contest for the patronage of Athens. Athena&#x27;s tapestry also depicted the 12 Olympian gods and defeat of mythological figures who challenged their authority. Arachne&#x27;s tapestry featured twenty-one episodes of the deities&#x27; infidelity, including Zeus being unfaithful with Leda, with Europa, and with Danaë. It represented the unjust and discrediting behavior of the gods towards mortals. Athena admitted that Arachne&#x27;s work was flawless, but was outraged at Arachne&#x27;s offensive choice of subject, which displayed the failings and transgressions of the deities. Finally, losing her temper, Athena destroyed Arachne&#x27;s tapestry and loom, striking it with her shuttle. Athena then struck Arachne across the face with her staff four times. Arachne hanged herself in despair, but Athena took pity on her and brought her back from the dead in the form of a spider.

In a rarer version, surviving in the scholia of an unnamed scholiast on Nicander, whose works heavily influenced Ovid, Arachne is placed in Attica instead and has a brother named Phalanx. Athena taught Arachne the art of weaving and Phalanx the art of war, but when brother and sister laid together in bed, Athena was so disgusted with them that she turned them both into spiders, animals forever doomed to be eaten by their own young.
===Trojan War===


The myth of the Judgement of Paris is mentioned briefly in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, but is described in depth in an epitome of the &quot;Cypria&quot;, a lost poem of the Epic Cycle, which records that all the gods and goddesses as well as various mortals were invited to the marriage of Peleus and Thetis (the eventual parents of Achilles). Only Eris, goddess of discord, was not invited. She was annoyed at this, so she arrived with a golden apple inscribed with the word καλλίστῃ (kallistēi, &quot;for the fairest&quot;), which she threw among the goddesses. Aphrodite, Hera, and Athena all claimed to be the fairest, and thus the rightful owner of the apple.

The goddesses chose to place the matter before Zeus, who, not wanting to favor one of the goddesses, put the choice into the hands of Paris, a Trojan prince. After bathing in the spring of Mount Ida where Troy was situated, the goddesses appeared before Paris for his decision. In the extant ancient depictions of the Judgement of Paris, Aphrodite is only occasionally represented nude, and Athena and Hera are always fully clothed. Since the Renaissance, however, Western paintings have typically portrayed all three goddesses as completely naked.

All three goddesses were ideally beautiful and Paris could not decide between them, so they resorted to bribes. Hera tried to bribe Paris with power over all Asia and Europe, and Athena offered fame and glory in battle, but Aphrodite promised Paris that, if he were to choose her as the fairest, she would let him marry the most beautiful woman on earth. This woman was Helen, who was already married to King Menelaus of Sparta. Paris selected Aphrodite and awarded her the apple. The other two goddesses were enraged and, as a direct result, sided with the Greeks in the Trojan War.

In Books V–VI of the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Athena aids the hero Diomedes, who, in the absence of Achilles, proves himself to be the most effective Greek warrior. Several artistic representations from the early sixth century BC may show Athena and Diomedes, including an early sixth-century BC shield band depicting Athena and an unidentified warrior riding on a chariot, a vase painting of a warrior with his charioteer facing Athena, and an inscribed clay plaque showing Diomedes and Athena riding in a chariot. Numerous passages in the &quot;Iliad&quot; also mention Athena having previously served as the patron of Diomedes&#x27;s father Tydeus. When the Trojan women go to the temple of Athena on the Acropolis to plead her for protection from Diomedes, Athena ignores them. 

In Book XXII of the &quot;Iliad&quot;, while Achilles is chasing Hector around the walls of Troy, Athena appears to Hector disguised as his brother Deiphobus and persuades him to hold his ground so that they can fight Achilles together. Then, Hector throws his spear at Achilles and misses, expecting Deiphobus to hand him another, but Athena disappears instead, leaving Hector to face Achilles alone without his spear. In Sophocles&#x27;s tragedy &quot;Ajax&quot;, she punishes Odysseus&#x27;s rival Ajax the Great, driving him insane and causing him to massacre the Achaeans&#x27; cattle, thinking that he is slaughtering the Achaeans themselves. Even after Odysseus himself expresses pity for Ajax, Athena declares, &quot;To laugh at your enemies – what sweeter laughter can there be than that?&quot; (lines 78–9). Ajax later commits suicide as a result of his humiliation.

==Classical art==
Athena appears frequently in classical Greek art, including on coins and in paintings on ceramics. She is especially prominent in works produced in Athens. In classical depictions, Athena is usually portrayed standing upright, wearing a full-length chiton. She is most often represented dressed in armor like a male soldier and wearing a Corinthian helmet raised high atop her forehead. Her shield bears at its centre the aegis with the head of the gorgon (&quot;gorgoneion&quot;) in the center and snakes around the edge. Sometimes she is shown wearing the aegis as a cloak. As Athena Promachos, she is shown brandishing a spear. Scenes in which Athena was represented include her birth from the head of Zeus, her battle with the Gigantes, the birth of Erichthonius, and the Judgement of Paris.

The &quot;Mourning Athena&quot; or &quot;Athena Meditating&quot; is a famous relief sculpture dating to around 470–460 BC that has been interpreted to represent Athena Polias. The most famous classical depiction of Athena was the &quot;Athena Parthenos&quot;, a now-lost gold and ivory statue of her in the Parthenon created by the Athenian sculptor Phidias. Copies reveal that this statue depicted Athena holding her shield in her left hand with Nike, the winged goddess of victory, standing in her right. Athena Polias is also represented in a Neo-Attic relief now held in the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, which depicts her holding an owl in her hand and wearing her characteristic Corinthian helmet while resting her shield against a nearby &quot;herma&quot;. The Roman goddess Minerva adopted most of Athena&#x27;s Greek iconographical associations, but was also integrated into the Capitoline Triad.

==Post-classical culture==
===Art and symbolism===
Early Christian writers, such as Clement of Alexandria and Firmicus, denigrated Athena as representative of all the things that were detestable about paganism; they condemned her as &quot;immodest and immoral&quot;. During the Middle Ages, however, many attributes of Athena were given to the Virgin Mary, who, in fourth-century portrayals, was often depicted wearing the Gorgoneion. Some even viewed the Virgin Mary as a warrior maiden, much like Athena Parthenos; one anecdote tells that the Virgin Mary once appeared upon the walls of Constantinople when it was under siege by the Avars, clutching a spear and urging the people to fight. During the Middle Ages, Athena became widely used as a Christian symbol and allegory, and she appeared on the family crests of certain noble houses.

During the Renaissance, Athena donned the mantle of patron of the arts and human endeavor; allegorical paintings involving Athena were a favorite of the Italian Renaissance painters. In Sandro Botticelli&#x27;s painting &quot;Pallas and the Centaur&quot;, probably painted sometime in the 1480s, Athena is the personification of chastity, who is shown grasping the forelock of a centaur, who represents lust. Andrea Mantegna&#x27;s 1502 painting &quot;Minerva Expelling the Vices from the Garden of Virtue&quot; uses Athena as the personification of Graeco-Roman learning chasing the vices of medievalism from the garden of modern scholarship. Athena is also used as the personification of wisdom in Bartholomeus Spranger&#x27;s 1591 painting &quot;The Triumph of Wisdom&quot; or &quot;Minerva Victorious over Ignorance&quot;.

During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Athena was used as a symbol for female rulers. In his book &quot;A Revelation of the True Minerva&quot; (1582), Thomas Blennerhassett portrays Queen Elizabeth I of England as a &quot;new Minerva&quot; and &quot;the greatest goddesse nowe on earth&quot;. A series of paintings by Peter Paul Rubens depict Athena as Marie de&#x27; Medici&#x27;s patron and mentor; the final painting in the series goes even further and shows Marie de&#x27; Medici with Athena&#x27;s iconography, as the mortal incarnation of the goddess herself. The Flemish sculptor Jean-Pierre-Antoine Tassaert (Jan Peter Anton Tassaert) later portrayed Catherine II of Russia as Athena in a marble bust in 1774. During the French Revolution, statues of pagan gods were torn down all throughout France, but statues of Athena were not. Instead, Athena was transformed into the personification of freedom and the republic and a statue of the goddess stood in the center of the Place de la Revolution in Paris. In the years following the Revolution, artistic representations of Athena proliferated.

A statue of Athena stands directly in front of the Austrian Parliament Building in Vienna, and depictions of Athena have influenced other symbols of Western freedom, including the Statue of Liberty and Britannia. For over a century, a full-scale replica of the Parthenon has stood in Nashville, Tennessee. In 1990, the curators added a gilded forty-two-foot (12.5 m) tall replica of Phidias&#x27;s &quot;Athena Parthenos&quot;, built from concrete and fiberglass. The Great Seal of California bears the image of Athena kneeling next to a brown grizzly bear. Athena has occasionally appeared on modern coins, as she did on the ancient Athenian drachma. Her head appears on the $50 1915-S Panama-Pacific commemorative coin.

===Modern interpretations===
One of Sigmund Freud&#x27;s most treasured possessions was a small, bronze sculpture of Athena, which sat on his desk. Freud once described Athena as &quot;a woman who is unapproachable and repels all sexual desires since she displays the terrifying genitals of the Mother&quot;. Feminist views on Athena are sharply divided; some feminists regard her as a symbol of female empowerment, while others regard her as &quot;the ultimate patriarchal sell out ... who uses her powers to promote and advance men rather than others of her sex&quot;. In contemporary Wicca, Athena is venerated as an aspect of the Goddess and some Wiccans believe that she may bestow the &quot;Owl Gift&quot; (&quot;the ability to write and communicate clearly&quot;) upon her worshippers. Due to her status as one of the twelve Olympians, Athena is a major deity in Hellenismos, a Neopagan religion which seeks to authentically revive and recreate the religion of ancient Greece in the modern world.

Athena is a natural patron of universities: At Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania, a statue of Athena (a replica of the original bronze one in the arts and archaeology library) resides in the Great Hall. It is traditional at exam time for students to leave offerings to the goddess with a note asking for good luck, or to repent for accidentally breaking any of the college&#x27;s numerous other traditions. Pallas Athena is the tutelary goddess of the international social fraternity Phi Delta Theta. Her owl is also a symbol of the fraternity.

<doc id="1183" wikidata="Q5452" url="?curid=1183" title="Amber Diceless Roleplaying Game">
<text>The Amber Diceless Roleplaying Game is a role-playing game created and written by Erick Wujcik, set in the fictional universe created by author Roger Zelazny for his &quot;Chronicles of Amber&quot;. The game is unusual in that no dice are used in resolving conflicts or player actions; instead a simple diceless system of comparative ability, and narrative description of the action by the players and gamemaster, is used to determine how situations are resolved.

&quot;Amber DRPG&quot; was created in the 1980s, and is much more focused on relationships and roleplaying than most of the roleplaying games of that era. Most &quot;Amber&quot; characters are members of the two ruling classes in the &quot;Amber&quot; multiverse, and are much more advanced in matters of strength, endurance, psyche, warfare and sorcery than ordinary beings. This often means that the only individuals who are capable of opposing a character are from his or her family, a fact that leads to much suspicion and intrigue.

==History==
Erick Wujcik wanted to design a role-playing game based on &quot;Amber&quot; for West End Games, and they agreed to look at his work. Wujcik intended to integrate the feel of the &quot;Amber&quot; setting from the novels into a role-playing game, and playtested his system for a few months at the Michigan Gaming Center where he decided to try it out as a diceless game. West End Games was not interested in a diceless role-playing game, so Wujcik acquired the role-playing game rights to &quot;Amber&quot; and offered the game to R. Talsorian Games, until he withdrew over creative differences. Wujcik then founded Phage Press, and published &quot;Amber Diceless Role-playing&quot; in 1991.

The original 256-page game book was published in 1991 by Phage Press, covering material from the first five novels (the &quot;Corwin Cycle&quot;) and some details – sorcery and the Logrus – from the remaining five novels (the &quot;Merlin Cycle&quot;), in order to allow players to roleplay characters from the Courts of Chaos. Some details were changed slightly to allow more player choice – for example, players can be full Trump Artists without having walked the Pattern or the Logrus, which Merlin says is impossible; and players&#x27; psychic abilities are far greater than those shown in the books.
A 256-page companion volume, &quot;Shadow Knight&quot;, was published in 1993. This supplemental includes the remaining elements from the Merlin novels, such as Broken Patterns, and allows players to create Constructs such as Merlin&#x27;s Ghostwheel. The book presents the second series of novels not as additions to the series&#x27; continuity but as an example of a roleplaying campaign with Merlin, Luke, Julia, Jurt and Coral as the PCs. The remainder of the book is a collection of essays on the game, statistics for the new characters and an update of the older ones in light of their appearance in the second series, and (perhaps most usefully for GMs) plot summaries of each of the ten books. The book includes some material from the short story &quot;The Salesman&#x27;s Tale,&quot; and some unpublished material cut from &quot;Prince of Chaos&quot;, notably Coral&#x27;s pregnancy by Merlin.

Both books were translated into French and published by Jeux Descartes in 1994 and 1995.

A third book, &quot;Rebma&quot;, was promised. Cover art was commissioned and pre-orders were taken, but it was never published. Wujcik also expressed a desire to create a book giving greater detail to the Courts of Chaos. The publishing rights to the &quot;Amber DRPG&quot; games were acquired in 2004 by Guardians of Order, who took over sales of the game and announced their intention to release a new edition of the game. However, no new edition was released before Guardians of Order went out of business in 2006. The two existing books are now out-of-print, but they have been made available as PDF downloads.

In June 2007 a new publishing company, headed by Edwin Voskamp and Eleanor Todd, was formed with the express purpose of bringing &quot;Amber DRPG&quot; back into print. The new company is named &quot;Diceless by Design&quot;.

In May 2010, &quot;Rite Publishing&quot; secured a license from Diceless by Design to use the rules system with a new setting in the creation of a new product to be written by industry and system veteran Jason Durall. The project Lords of Gossamer &amp; Shadow (Diceless) was funded via Kickstarter in May 2013. In Sept 2013 the project was completed, and on in Nov 2013 Lords of Gossamer and Shadow (Diceless) was released publicly in full-color Print and PDF, along with additional supplements and continued support.

==Setting==

The game is set in the multiverse described in Zelazny&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles of Amber&quot;. The first book assumes that gamemasters will set their campaigns after the Patternfall war; that is, after the end of the fifth book in the series, &quot;The Courts of Chaos&quot;, but uses material from the following books to describe those parts of Zelazny&#x27;s cosmology that were featured there in more detail. The &quot;Amber&quot; multiverse consists of Amber, a city at one pole of the universe wherein is found the Pattern, the symbol of Order; The Courts of Chaos, an assembly of worlds at the other pole where can be found the Logrus, the manifestation of Chaos, and the Abyss, the source or end of all reality; and Shadow, the collection of all possible universes (shadows) between and around them. Inhabitants of either pole can use one or both of the Pattern and the Logrus to travel through Shadow.

It is assumed that players will portray the children of the main characters from the books – the ruling family of Amber, known as the Elder Amberites – or a resident of the Courts. However, since some feel that being the children of the main characters is too limiting, it is fairly common to either start with King Oberon&#x27;s death &quot;before&quot; the book begins and roleplay the Elder Amberites as they vie for the throne; or to populate Amber from scratch with a different set of Elder Amberites. The former option is one presented in the book; the latter is known in the Amber community as an &quot;Amethyst&quot; game. A third option is to have the players portray Corwin&#x27;s children, in an Amber-like city built around Corwin&#x27;s pattern; this is sometimes called an &quot;Argent&quot; game, since one of Corwin&#x27;s heraldic colours is Silver.

==System==

===Attributes===
Characters in &quot;Amber DRPG&quot; are represented by four attributes: &quot;Psyche&quot;, &quot;Strength&quot;, &quot;Endurance&quot; and &quot;Warfare&quot;.
*Psyche is used for feats of willpower or magic
*Strength is used for feats of strength or unarmed combat
*Endurance is used for feats of endurance
*Warfare is used for armed combat, from duelling to commanding armies
The attributes run from −25 (normal human level), through −10 (normal level for a denizen of the Courts of Chaos) and 0 (normal level for an inhabitant of Amber), upwards without limit. Scores above 0 are &quot;ranked&quot;, with the highest score being ranked 1st, the next-highest 2nd, and so on. The character with 1st rank in each attribute is considered &quot;superior&quot; in that attribute, being considered to be substantially better than the character with 2nd rank even if the difference in scores is small. All else being equal, a character with a higher rank in an attribute will always win a contest based on that attribute.

====The Attribute Auction====
A character&#x27;s ability scores are purchased during character creation in an auction; players get 100 character points, and bid on each attribute in turn. The character who bids the most for an attribute is &quot;ranked&quot; first and is considered superior to all other characters in that attribute. Unlike conventional auctions, bids are non-refundable; if one player bids 65 for psyche and another wins with a bid of 66, then the character with 66 is &quot;superior&quot; to the character with 65 even though there is only one bid difference. Instead, lower bidding characters are ranked in ascending order according to how much they have bid, the characters becoming progressively weaker in that attribute as they pay less for it. After the auction, players can secretly pay extra points to raise their ranks, but they can only pay to raise their scores to an existing rank. Further, a character with a bid-for rank is considered to have a slight advantage over character with a bought-up rank.

The Auction simulates a &#x27;history&#x27; of competition between the descendants of Oberon for player characters who have not had dozens of decades to get to know each other. Through the competitive Auction, characters may begin the game vying for standings. The auction serves to introduce some unpredictability into character creation without the need to resort to dice, cards, or other randomizing devices. A player may intend, for example, to create a character who is a strong, mighty warrior, but being &quot;outplayed&quot; in the auction may result in lower attribute scores than anticipated, therefore necessitating a change of character concept. Since a player cannot control another player&#x27;s bids, and since all bids are non-refundable, the auction involves a considerable amount of strategizing and prioritization by players. A willingness to spend as many points as possible on an attribute may improve your chances of a high ranking, but too reckless a spending strategy could leave a player with few points to spend on powers and objects. In a hotly contested auction, such as for the important attribute of warfare, the most valuable skill is the ability to force one&#x27;s opponents to back down. With two or more equally determined players, this can result in a &quot;bidding war,&quot; in which the attribute is driven up by increments to large sums. An alternative strategy is to try to cow other players into submission with a high opening bid. Most players bid low amounts between one and ten points in an initial bid in order to feel out the competition and to save points for other uses. A high enough opening bid could signal a player&#x27;s determination to be first ranked in that attribute, thereby dissuading others from competing.

====Psyche in &quot;Amber DRPG&quot; compared to the &quot;Chronicles&quot;====
Characters with high psyche are presented as having strong telepathic abilities, being able to hypnotise and even mentally dominate any character with lesser psyche with whom they can make eye-contact. This is likely due to three scenes in the &quot;Chronicles&quot;: first, when Eric paralyzes Corwin with an attack across the Trump and refuses to desist because one or the other would be dominated; second, when Corwin faces the demon Strygalldwir, it is able to wrestle mentally with him when their gazes meet; and third, when Fiona is able to keep Brand immobile in the final battle at the Courts of Chaos. However, in general, the books only feature mental battles when there is some reason for mind-to-mind contact (for example, Trump contact) and magic or Trump is involved in all three of the above conflicts, so it is not clear whether Zelazny intended his characters to have such a power; the combination of Brand&#x27;s &quot;living trump&quot; powers and his high Psyche (as presented in the roleplaying game) would have guaranteed him victory over Corwin. &quot;Shadow Knight&quot; does address this inconsistency somewhat, by presenting the &quot;living trump&quot; abilities as somewhat limited.

===Powers===
Characters in &quot;Amber DRPG&quot; have access to the powers seen in the &quot;Chronicles of Amber&quot;: &quot;Pattern&quot;, &quot;Logrus&quot;, &quot;Shape-shifting&quot;, &quot;Trump&quot;, and &quot;magic&quot;.

*Pattern: A character who has walked the pattern can walk in shadow to any possible universe, and while there can manipulate probability.
*Logrus: A character who has mastered the Logrus can send out Logrus tendrils and pull themselves or objects through shadow.
*Shape-shifting: Shape-shifters can alter their physical form and abilities.
*Trump: Trump Artists can create Trumps, a sort of tarot card which allows mental communication and travel. The book features Trump portraits of each of the elder Amberites. The trump picture of Corwin is executed in a subtly different style – and has features very similar to Roger Zelazny&#x27;s.
*Magic: Three types of magic are detailed: Power Words, with a quick, small effect; Sorcery, with pre-prepared spells as in many other game systems; and Conjuration, the creation of small objects.

Each of the first four powers is available in an advanced form.

===Artifacts, Personal shadows and Constructs===
While a character with Pattern, Logrus or Conjuration can acquire virtually any object, players can choose to spend character points to obtain objects with particular virtues – unbreakability, or a mind of their own. Since they have paid points for the items, they are a part of the character&#x27;s legend, and cannot lightly be destroyed. Similarly, a character can find any possible universe, but they can spend character points to know of or inhabit shadows which are (in some sense) &quot;real&quot; and therefore useful. The expansion, &quot;Shadow Knight&quot;, adds Constructs – artifacts with connections to shadows.

===Stuff===
Unspent character points become good stuff – a good luck for the character. Players are also allowed to overspend (in moderation), with the points becoming bad stuff – bad luck which the Gamemaster should inflict on the character. Stuff governs how non-player characters perceive and respond to the character: characters with good stuff will often receive friendly or helpful reactions, while characters with bad stuff are often treated with suspicion or hostility.

As well as representing luck, stuff can be seen as representing a character&#x27;s outlook on the universe: characters with good stuff seeing the multiverse as a cheerful place, while characters with bad stuff see it as hostile.

===Conflict resolution===
In any given fair conflict between two characters, the character with the higher score in the relevant attribute will eventually win. The key words here are &quot;fair&quot; and &quot;eventually&quot; – if characters&#x27; ranks are close, and the weaker character has obtained some advantage, then the weaker character can escape defeat or perhaps prevail. Close ranks result in longer contests while greater difference between ranks result in fast resolution. Alternatively, if characters&#x27; attribute ranks are close, the weaker character can try to change the relevant attribute by changing the nature of the conflict. For example, if two characters are wrestling the relevant attribute is Strength; a character could reveal a weapon, changing it to Warfare; they could try to overcome the other character&#x27;s mind using a power, changing it to Psyche; or they could concentrate their strength on defense, changing it to Endurance. If there is a substantial difference between characters&#x27; ranks, the conflict is generally over before the weaker character can react.

===The &quot;Golden Rule&quot;===
&quot;Amber DRPG&quot; advises gamemasters to change rules as they see fit, even to the point of adding or removing powers or attributes.

==Reception==
Steve Crow reviewed &quot;Amber Diceless Roleplaying Game&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #31 (May/June, 1992), rating it a 4 out of 5 and stated that &quot;It is undoubtedly a game for experienced gamers. While I would not recommend &quot;Amber&quot; to novices, it is a must buy for experienced gamemasters and players looking for new challenges.&quot;

In the June 1992 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 182), both Lester Smith and Allen Varney published reviews of this game.
* Smith admired the professional production qualities of the 256-page rulebook, noting that because it was Smyth sewn in 32-page signatures, the book would always lie flat when opened. However, he found the typeface difficult to read, and the lack a coherent hierarchy of rules increased the reading difficulty as well. Smith admired the Attribute Auction and point-buy system for skills, and the focus on roleplaying in place of dice-rolling, but he mused that all of the roleplaying would mean &quot;GMs have to spend quite a bit of time and creative effort coming up with wide-reaching plots for their players to work through. Canned, linear adventures just won&#x27;t serve.&quot; He concluded by stating that the diceless system is not for every gamer: &quot;As impressed as I am with the game, do I think it is the &#x27;end-all&#x27; of role-playing games, or that diceless systems are the wave of the future? I&#x27;ll give a firm “No” on both counts... However, I certainly do think that the &quot;Amber Diceless Roleplaying Game&quot; is destined for great popularity and a niche among the most respected of role-playing game designs.&quot;
*Allen Varney thought the &quot;Attribute Auction&quot; to be &quot;brilliant and elegant&quot;, but he wondered if character advancement was perhaps too slow to keep marginal players interested. He also believed that being a gamemaster would be &quot;tough work. Proceed with caution.&quot; Varney recommended that players need some familiarity with the first five &quot;Amber&quot; novels by Zelazny. He concluded, &quot;The intensity of the &quot;Amber&quot; game indicates [game designer Erik ] Wujcik is on to something. When success in every action depends on the role and not the roll, players develop a sense of both control and urgency, along with creativity that borders on mania.&quot;

In Issue 65 of &quot;Challenge&quot;, Dirk DeJong had a good first impression of the game, especially the information provided about the Amber family members and their various flaws and strengths. However he found that &quot;The biggest problem with this endeavor, and its downfall, is the nature of the conflict systems. First, they are diceless, really diceless, and don&#x27;t involve any sort of random factors at all, aside from those that you can introduce by roleplaying them out. Thus, if you get involved with a character who&#x27;s better than you at sword-fighting, even if only by one point out of 100, you&#x27;re pretty much dead meat, unless you can act your way out.&quot; DeJong also disagreed with the suggestion that if the referee and players disagreed with a rule to simply remove it from the game. &quot;I thought the entire idea of using rules and random results was to prevent the type of arguments that I can see arising from this setup.&quot; DeJong concluded on an ambivalent note, saying, &quot;If you love Zelazny and the Amber series, jump on it, as this is the premier sourcebook for running an Amber campaign. [...] Personally, I just can&#x27;t get turned on by a system that expects me to either be content with a simple subtraction of numbers to find out who won, or to describe an entire combat blow by blow, just so that I can attempt some trick to win.&quot;

Loyd Blankenship reviewed &quot;Amber&quot; in &quot;Pyramid&quot; #2 (July/Aug., 1993), and stated that &quot;&quot;Amber&quot; is a valuable resource to a GM - even if he isn&#x27;t running an &quot;Amber&quot; game. For gamers who have an aspiring actor or actress lurking within their breast, or for someone running a campaign via electronic mail or message base, &quot;Amber&quot; should be given serious consideration.&quot;

In his 2023 book &quot;Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground&quot;, RPG historian Stu Horvath noted, &quot;There hasn&#x27;t been an RPG quite like &quot;Amber&quot;, before or since. Bold though it was, the game didn&#x27;t do very well commercially. The lack of dice became a flashpoint of controversy, with dice enthusiasts dramatically swearing off the game. That&#x27;s a bit ridiculous, but it does get at a key hurdle &quot;Amber&quot; face: People &quot;like&quot; rolling dice. They&#x27;ve been doing it for thousands of years and a significant part of the appeal of RPGs is giving dice, often in sparkly colours, a toss.&quot;

==Community==
Despite the game&#x27;s out-of-print status, a thriving convention scene exists supporting the game. Amber conventions, known as &quot;Ambercons&quot;, are held yearly in Massachusetts, Michigan, Portland (United States), Milton Keynes (England), Belfast (Northern Ireland) and Modena, Italy. Additionally, Phage Press published 12 volumes of a dedicated &quot;Amber DRPG&quot; magazine called &quot;Amberzine&quot;. Some &quot;Amberzine&quot; issues are still available from Phage Press.

<text>An alloy is a mixture of chemical elements of which in most cases at least one is a metallic element, although it is also sometimes used for mixtures of elements; herein only metallic alloys are described. Most alloys are metallic and show good electrical conductivity, ductility, opacity, and luster, and may have properties that differ from those of the pure elements such as increased strength or hardness. In some cases, an alloy may reduce the overall cost of the material while preserving important properties. In other cases, the mixture imparts synergistic properties such as corrosion resistance or mechanical strength.

In an alloy, the atoms are joined by metallic bonding rather than by covalent bonds typically found in chemical compounds. The alloy constituents are usually measured by mass percentage for practical applications, and in atomic fraction for basic science studies. Alloys are usually classified as substitutional or interstitial alloys, depending on the atomic arrangement that forms the alloy. They can be further classified as homogeneous (consisting of a single phase), or heterogeneous (consisting of two or more phases) or intermetallic. An alloy may be a solid solution of metal elements (a single phase, where all metallic grains (crystals) are of the same composition) or a mixture of metallic phases (two or more solutions, forming a microstructure of different crystals within the metal).

Examples of alloys include red gold (gold and copper), white gold (gold and silver), sterling silver (silver and copper), steel or silicon steel (iron with non-metallic carbon or silicon respectively), solder, brass, pewter, duralumin, bronze, and amalgams.

Alloys are used in a wide variety of applications, from the steel alloys, used in everything from buildings to automobiles to surgical tools, to exotic titanium alloys used in the aerospace industry, to beryllium-copper alloys for non-sparking tools.

== Characteristics ==
An alloy is a mixture of chemical elements, which forms an impure substance (admixture) that retains the characteristics of a metal. An alloy is distinct from an impure metal in that, with an alloy, the added elements are well controlled to produce desirable properties, while impure metals such as wrought iron are less controlled, but are often considered useful. Alloys are made by mixing two or more elements, at least one of which is a metal. This is usually called the primary metal or the base metal, and the name of this metal may also be the name of the alloy. The other constituents may or may not be metals but, when mixed with the molten base, they will be soluble and dissolve into the mixture.
The mechanical properties of alloys will often be quite different from those of its individual constituents. A metal that is normally very soft (malleable), such as aluminium, can be altered by alloying it with another soft metal, such as copper. Although both metals are very soft and ductile, the resulting aluminium alloy will have much greater strength. Adding a small amount of non-metallic carbon to iron trades its great ductility for the greater strength of an alloy called steel. Due to its very-high strength, but still substantial toughness, and its ability to be greatly altered by heat treatment, steel is one of the most useful and common alloys in modern use. By adding chromium to steel, its resistance to corrosion can be enhanced, creating stainless steel, while adding silicon will alter its electrical characteristics, producing silicon steel.

Like oil and water, a molten metal may not always mix with another element. For example, pure iron is almost completely insoluble with copper. Even when the constituents are soluble, each will usually have a saturation point, beyond which no more of the constituent can be added. Iron, for example, can hold a maximum of 6.67% carbon. Although the elements of an alloy usually must be soluble in the liquid state, they may not always be soluble in the solid state. If the metals remain soluble when solid, the alloy forms a solid solution, becoming a homogeneous structure consisting of identical crystals, called a phase. If as the mixture cools the constituents become insoluble, they may separate to form two or more different types of crystals, creating a heterogeneous microstructure of different phases, some with more of one constituent than the other. However, in other alloys, the insoluble elements may not separate until after crystallization occurs. If cooled very quickly, they first crystallize as a homogeneous phase, but they are supersaturated with the secondary constituents. As time passes, the atoms of these supersaturated alloys can separate from the crystal lattice, becoming more stable, and forming a second phase that serves to reinforce the crystals internally.

Some alloys, such as electrum—an alloy of silver and gold—occur naturally. Meteorites are sometimes made of naturally occurring alloys of iron and nickel, but are not native to the Earth. One of the first alloys made by humans was bronze, which is a mixture of the metals tin and copper. Bronze was an extremely useful alloy to the ancients, because it is much stronger and harder than either of its components. Steel was another common alloy. However, in ancient times, it could only be created as an accidental byproduct from the heating of iron ore in fires (smelting) during the manufacture of iron. Other ancient alloys include pewter, brass and pig iron. In the modern age, steel can be created in many forms. Carbon steel can be made by varying only the carbon content, producing soft alloys like mild steel or hard alloys like spring steel. Alloy steels can be made by adding other elements, such as chromium, molybdenum, vanadium or nickel, resulting in alloys such as high-speed steel or tool steel. Small amounts of manganese are usually alloyed with most modern steels because of its ability to remove unwanted impurities, like phosphorus, sulfur and oxygen, which can have detrimental effects on the alloy. However, most alloys were not created until the 1900s, such as various aluminium, titanium, nickel, and magnesium alloys. Some modern superalloys, such as incoloy, inconel, and hastelloy, may consist of a multitude of different elements.

An alloy is technically an impure metal, but when referring to alloys, the term &quot;impurities&quot; usually denotes undesirable elements. Such impurities are introduced from the base metals and alloying elements, but are removed during processing. For instance, sulfur is a common impurity in steel. Sulfur combines readily with iron to form iron sulfide, which is very brittle, creating weak spots in the steel. Lithium, sodium and calcium are common impurities in aluminium alloys, which can have adverse effects on the structural integrity of castings. Conversely, otherwise pure-metals that contain unwanted impurities are often called &quot;impure metals&quot; and are not usually referred to as alloys. Oxygen, present in the air, readily combines with most metals to form metal oxides; especially at higher temperatures encountered during alloying. Great care is often taken during the alloying process to remove excess impurities, using fluxes, chemical additives, or other methods of extractive metallurgy.

== Theory ==

Alloying a metal is done by combining it with one or more other elements. The most common and oldest alloying process is performed by heating the base metal beyond its melting point and then dissolving the solutes into the molten liquid, which may be possible even if the melting point of the solute is far greater than that of the base. For example, in its liquid state, titanium is a very strong solvent capable of dissolving most metals and elements. In addition, it readily absorbs gases like oxygen and burns in the presence of nitrogen. This increases the chance of contamination from any contacting surface, and so must be melted in vacuum induction-heating and special, water-cooled, copper crucibles. However, some metals and solutes, such as iron and carbon, have very high melting-points and were impossible for ancient people to melt. Thus, alloying (in particular, interstitial alloying) may also be performed with one or more constituents in a gaseous state, such as found in a blast furnace to make pig iron (liquid-gas), nitriding, carbonitriding or other forms of case hardening (solid-gas), or the cementation process used to make blister steel (solid-gas). It may also be done with one, more, or all of the constituents in the solid state, such as found in ancient methods of pattern welding (solid-solid), shear steel (solid-solid), or crucible steel production (solid-liquid), mixing the elements via solid-state diffusion.

By adding another element to a metal, differences in the size of the atoms create internal stresses in the lattice of the metallic crystals; stresses that often enhance its properties. For example, the combination of carbon with iron produces steel, which is stronger than iron, its primary element. The electrical and thermal conductivity of alloys is usually lower than that of the pure metals. The physical properties, such as density, reactivity, Young&#x27;s modulus of an alloy may not differ greatly from those of its base element, but engineering properties such as tensile strength, ductility, and shear strength may be substantially different from those of the constituent materials. This is sometimes a result of the sizes of the atoms in the alloy, because larger atoms exert a compressive force on neighboring atoms, and smaller atoms exert a tensile force on their neighbors, helping the alloy resist deformation. Sometimes alloys may exhibit marked differences in behavior even when small amounts of one element are present. For example, impurities in semiconducting ferromagnetic alloys lead to different properties, as first predicted by White, Hogan, Suhl, Tian Abrie and Nakamura.

Unlike pure metals, most alloys do not have a single melting point, but a melting range during which the material is a mixture of solid and liquid phases (a slush). The temperature at which melting begins is called the solidus, and the temperature when melting is just complete is called the liquidus. For many alloys there is a particular alloy proportion (in some cases more than one), called either a eutectic mixture or a peritectic composition, which gives the alloy a unique and low melting point, and no liquid/solid slush transition.

=== Heat treatment ===

Alloying elements are added to a base metal, to induce hardness, toughness, ductility, or other desired properties. Most metals and alloys can be work hardened by creating defects in their crystal structure. These defects are created during plastic deformation by hammering, bending, extruding, et cetera, and are permanent unless the metal is recrystallized. Otherwise, some alloys can also have their properties altered by heat treatment. Nearly all metals can be softened by annealing, which recrystallizes the alloy and repairs the defects, but not as many can be hardened by controlled heating and cooling. Many alloys of aluminium, copper, magnesium, titanium, and nickel can be strengthened to some degree by some method of heat treatment, but few respond to this to the same degree as does steel.

The base metal iron of the iron-carbon alloy known as steel, undergoes a change in the arrangement (allotropy) of the atoms of its crystal matrix at a certain temperature (usually between and , depending on carbon content). This allows the smaller carbon atoms to enter the interstices of the iron crystal. When this diffusion happens, the carbon atoms are said to be in &quot;solution&quot; in the iron, forming a particular single, homogeneous, crystalline phase called austenite. If the steel is cooled slowly, the carbon can diffuse out of the iron and it will gradually revert to its low temperature allotrope. During slow cooling, the carbon atoms will no longer be as soluble with the iron, and will be forced to precipitate out of solution, nucleating into a more concentrated form of iron carbide (Fe3C) in the spaces between the pure iron crystals. The steel then becomes heterogeneous, as it is formed of two phases, the iron-carbon phase called cementite (or carbide), and pure iron ferrite. Such a heat treatment produces a steel that is rather soft. If the steel is cooled quickly, however, the carbon atoms will not have time to diffuse and precipitate out as carbide, but will be trapped within the iron crystals. When rapidly cooled, a diffusionless (martensite) transformation occurs, in which the carbon atoms become trapped in solution. This causes the iron crystals to deform as the crystal structure tries to change to its low temperature state, leaving those crystals very hard but much less ductile (more brittle).

While the high strength of steel results when diffusion and precipitation is prevented (forming martensite), most heat-treatable alloys are precipitation hardening alloys, that depend on the diffusion of alloying elements to achieve their strength. When heated to form a solution and then cooled quickly, these alloys become much softer than normal, during the diffusionless transformation, but then harden as they age. The solutes in these alloys will precipitate over time, forming intermetallic phases, which are difficult to discern from the base metal. Unlike steel, in which the solid solution separates into different crystal phases (carbide and ferrite), precipitation hardening alloys form different phases within the same crystal. These intermetallic alloys appear homogeneous in crystal structure, but tend to behave heterogeneously, becoming hard and somewhat brittle.

In 1906, precipitation hardening alloys were discovered by Alfred Wilm. Precipitation hardening alloys, such as certain alloys of aluminium, titanium, and copper, are heat-treatable alloys that soften when quenched (cooled quickly), and then harden over time. Wilm had been searching for a way to harden aluminium alloys for use in machine-gun cartridge cases. Knowing that aluminium-copper alloys were heat-treatable to some degree, Wilm tried quenching a ternary alloy of aluminium, copper, and the addition of magnesium, but was initially disappointed with the results. However, when Wilm retested it the next day he discovered that the alloy increased in hardness when left to age at room temperature, and far exceeded his expectations. Although an explanation for the phenomenon was not provided until 1919, duralumin was one of the first &quot;age hardening&quot; alloys used, becoming the primary building material for the first Zeppelins, and was soon followed by many others. Because they often exhibit a combination of high strength and low weight, these alloys became widely used in many forms of industry, including the construction of modern aircraft.

=== Mechanisms ===
When a molten metal is mixed with another substance, there are two mechanisms that can cause an alloy to form, called &quot;atom exchange&quot; and the &quot;interstitial mechanism&quot;. The relative size of each element in the mix plays a primary role in determining which mechanism will occur. When the atoms are relatively similar in size, the atom exchange method usually happens, where some of the atoms composing the metallic crystals are substituted with atoms of the other constituent. This is called a &quot;substitutional alloy&quot;. Examples of substitutional alloys include bronze and brass, in which some of the copper atoms are substituted with either tin or zinc atoms respectively.

In the case of the interstitial mechanism, one atom is usually much smaller than the other and can not successfully substitute for the other type of atom in the crystals of the base metal. Instead, the smaller atoms become trapped in the interstitial sites between the atoms of the crystal matrix. This is referred to as an &quot;interstitial alloy&quot;. Steel is an example of an interstitial alloy, because the very small carbon atoms fit into interstices of the iron matrix.

Stainless steel is an example of a combination of interstitial and substitutional alloys, because the carbon atoms fit into the interstices, but some of the iron atoms are substituted by nickel and chromium atoms.

== History and examples ==
=== Meteoric iron ===

The use of alloys by humans started with the use of meteoric iron, a naturally occurring alloy of nickel and iron. It is the main constituent of iron meteorites. As no metallurgic processes were used to separate iron from nickel, the alloy was used as it was. Meteoric iron could be forged from a red heat to make objects such as tools, weapons, and nails. In many cultures it was shaped by cold hammering into knives and arrowheads. They were often used as anvils. Meteoric iron was very rare and valuable, and difficult for ancient people to work.

=== Bronze and brass ===

Iron is usually found as iron ore on Earth, except for one deposit of native iron in Greenland, which was used by the Inuit. Native copper, however, was found worldwide, along with silver, gold, and platinum, which were also used to make tools, jewelry, and other objects since Neolithic times. Copper was the hardest of these metals, and the most widely distributed. It became one of the most important metals to the ancients. Around 10,000 years ago in the highlands of Anatolia (Turkey), humans learned to smelt metals such as copper and tin from ore. Around 2500 BC, people began alloying the two metals to form bronze, which was much harder than its ingredients. Tin was rare, however, being found mostly in Great Britain. In the Middle East, people began alloying copper with zinc to form brass. Ancient civilizations took into account the mixture and the various properties it produced, such as hardness, toughness and melting point, under various conditions of temperature and work hardening, developing much of the information contained in modern alloy phase diagrams. For example, arrowheads from the Chinese Qin dynasty (around 200 BC) were often constructed with a hard bronze-head, but a softer bronze-tang, combining the alloys to prevent both dulling and breaking during use.

=== Amalgams ===

Mercury has been smelted from cinnabar for thousands of years. Mercury dissolves many metals, such as gold, silver, and tin, to form amalgams (an alloy in a soft paste or liquid form at ambient temperature). Amalgams have been used since 200 BC in China for gilding objects such as armor and mirrors with precious metals. The ancient Romans often used mercury-tin amalgams for gilding their armor. The amalgam was applied as a paste and then heated until the mercury vaporized, leaving the gold, silver, or tin behind. Mercury was often used in mining, to extract precious metals like gold and silver from their ores.

=== Precious metals ===
Many ancient civilizations alloyed metals for purely aesthetic purposes. In ancient Egypt and Mycenae, gold was often alloyed with copper to produce red-gold, or iron to produce a bright burgundy-gold. Gold was often found alloyed with silver or other metals to produce various types of colored gold. These metals were also used to strengthen each other, for more practical purposes. Copper was often added to silver to make sterling silver, increasing its strength for use in dishes, silverware, and other practical items. Quite often, precious metals were alloyed with less valuable substances as a means to deceive buyers. Around 250 BC, Archimedes was commissioned by the King of Syracuse to find a way to check the purity of the gold in a crown, leading to the famous bath-house shouting of &quot;Eureka!&quot; upon the discovery of Archimedes&#x27; principle.

=== Pewter ===

The term pewter covers a variety of alloys consisting primarily of tin. As a pure metal, tin is much too soft to use for most practical purposes. However, during the Bronze Age, tin was a rare metal in many parts of Europe and the Mediterranean, so it was often valued higher than gold. To make jewellery, cutlery, or other objects from tin, workers usually alloyed it with other metals to increase strength and hardness. These metals were typically lead, antimony, bismuth or copper. These solutes were sometimes added individually in varying amounts, or added together, making a wide variety of objects, ranging from practical items such as dishes, surgical tools, candlesticks or funnels, to decorative items like ear rings and hair clips.

The earliest examples of pewter come from ancient Egypt, around 1450 BC. The use of pewter was widespread across Europe, from France to Norway and Britain (where most of the ancient tin was mined) to the Near East. The alloy was also used in China and the Far East, arriving in Japan around 800 AD, where it was used for making objects like ceremonial vessels, tea canisters, or chalices used in shinto shrines.

=== Iron ===
The first known smelting of iron began in Anatolia, around 1800 BC. Called the bloomery process, it produced very soft but ductile wrought iron. By 800 BC, iron-making technology had spread to Europe, arriving in Japan around 700 AD. Pig iron, a very hard but brittle alloy of iron and carbon, was being produced in China as early as 1200 BC, but did not arrive in Europe until the Middle Ages. Pig iron has a lower melting point than iron, and was used for making cast-iron. However, these metals found little practical use until the introduction of crucible steel around 300 BC. These steels were of poor quality, and the introduction of pattern welding, around the 1st century AD, sought to balance the extreme properties of the alloys by laminating them, to create a tougher metal. Around 700 AD, the Japanese began folding bloomery-steel and cast-iron in alternating layers to increase the strength of their swords, using clay fluxes to remove slag and impurities. This method of Japanese swordsmithing produced one of the purest steel-alloys of the ancient world.

While the use of iron started to become more widespread around 1200 BC, mainly because of interruptions in the trade routes for tin, the metal was much softer than bronze. However, very small amounts of steel, (an alloy of iron and around 1% carbon), was always a byproduct of the bloomery process. The ability to modify the hardness of steel by heat treatment had been known since 1100 BC, and the rare material was valued for the manufacture of tools and weapons. Because the ancients could not produce temperatures high enough to melt iron fully, the production of steel in decent quantities did not occur until the introduction of blister steel during the Middle Ages. This method introduced carbon by heating wrought iron in charcoal for long periods of time, but the absorption of carbon in this manner is extremely slow thus the penetration was not very deep, so the alloy was not homogeneous. In 1740, Benjamin Huntsman began melting blister steel in a crucible to even out the carbon content, creating the first process for the mass production of tool steel. Huntsman&#x27;s process was used for manufacturing tool steel until the early 1900s.

The introduction of the blast furnace to Europe in the Middle Ages meant that people could produce pig iron in much higher volumes than wrought iron. Because pig iron could be melted, people began to develop processes to reduce carbon in liquid pig iron to create steel. Puddling had been used in China since the first century, and was introduced in Europe during the 1700s, where molten pig iron was stirred while exposed to the air, to remove the carbon by oxidation. In 1858, Henry Bessemer developed a process of steel-making by blowing hot air through liquid pig iron to reduce the carbon content. The Bessemer process led to the first large scale manufacture of steel.

Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon, but the term &quot;alloy steel&quot; usually only refers to steels that contain other elements— like vanadium, molybdenum, or cobalt—in amounts sufficient to alter the properties of the base steel. Since ancient times, when steel was used primarily for tools and weapons, the methods of producing and working the metal were often closely guarded secrets. Even long after the Age of Enlightenment, the steel industry was very competitive and manufacturers went through great lengths to keep their processes confidential, resisting any attempts to scientifically analyze the material for fear it would reveal their methods. For example, the people of Sheffield, a center of steel production in England, were known to routinely bar visitors and tourists from entering town to deter industrial espionage. Thus, almost no metallurgical information existed about steel until 1860. Because of this lack of understanding, steel was not generally considered an alloy until the decades between 1930 and 1970 (primarily due to the work of scientists like William Chandler Roberts-Austen, Adolf Martens, and Edgar Bain), so &quot;alloy steel&quot; became the popular term for ternary and quaternary steel-alloys.

After Benjamin Huntsman developed his crucible steel in 1740, he began experimenting with the addition of elements like manganese (in the form of a high-manganese pig-iron called &quot;spiegeleisen&quot;), which helped remove impurities such as phosphorus and oxygen; a process adopted by Bessemer and still used in modern steels (albeit in concentrations low enough to still be considered carbon steel). Afterward, many people began experimenting with various alloys of steel without much success. However, in 1882, Robert Hadfield, being a pioneer in steel metallurgy, took an interest and produced a steel alloy containing around 12% manganese. Called mangalloy, it exhibited extreme hardness and toughness, becoming the first commercially viable alloy-steel. Afterward, he created silicon steel, launching the search for other possible alloys of steel.

Robert Forester Mushet found that by adding tungsten to steel it could produce a very hard edge that would resist losing its hardness at high temperatures. &quot;R. Mushet&#x27;s special steel&quot; (RMS) became the first high-speed steel. Mushet&#x27;s steel was quickly replaced by tungsten carbide steel, developed by Taylor and White in 1900, in which they doubled the tungsten content and added small amounts of chromium and vanadium, producing a superior steel for use in lathes and machining tools. In 1903, the Wright brothers used a chromium-nickel steel to make the crankshaft for their airplane engine, while in 1908 Henry Ford began using vanadium steels for parts like crankshafts and valves in his Model T Ford, due to their higher strength and resistance to high temperatures. In 1912, the Krupp Ironworks in Germany developed a rust-resistant steel by adding 21% chromium and 7% nickel, producing the first stainless steel.

=== Others ===

Due to their high reactivity, most metals were not discovered until the 19th century. A method for extracting aluminium from bauxite was proposed by Humphry Davy in 1807, using an electric arc. Although his attempts were unsuccessful, by 1855 the first sales of pure aluminium reached the market. However, as extractive metallurgy was still in its infancy, most aluminium extraction-processes produced unintended alloys contaminated with other elements found in the ore; the most abundant of which was copper. These aluminium-copper alloys (at the time termed &quot;aluminum bronze&quot;) preceded pure aluminium, offering greater strength and hardness over the soft, pure metal, and to a slight degree were found to be heat treatable. However, due to their softness and limited hardenability these alloys found little practical use, and were more of a novelty, until the Wright brothers used an aluminium alloy to construct the first airplane engine in 1903. During the time between 1865 and 1910, processes for extracting many other metals were discovered, such as chromium, vanadium, tungsten, iridium, cobalt, and molybdenum, and various alloys were developed.

Prior to 1910, research mainly consisted of private individuals tinkering in their own laboratories. However, as the aircraft and automotive industries began growing, research into alloys became an industrial effort in the years following 1910, as new magnesium alloys were developed for pistons and wheels in cars, and pot metal for levers and knobs, and aluminium alloys developed for airframes and aircraft skins were put into use. The Doehler Die Casting Co. of Toledo, Ohio were known for the production of &quot;Brastil&quot;, a high tensile corrosion resistant bronze alloy.

<text>Throughout history, forms of art have gone through periodic abrupt changes called artistic revolutions. Movements have come to an end to be replaced by a new movement markedly different in striking ways.

== Scientific and technological ==
1
Not all artistic revolutions were political. Sometimes, science and technological innovations have brought about unforeseen transformations in the works of artists. The stylistic revolution known as Impressionism, by painters eager to more accurately capture the changing colors of light and shadow, is inseparable from discoveries and inventions in the mid-19th century in which the style was born.

Michel Eugène Chevreul, a French chemist hired as director of dyes at a French tapestry works, began to investigate the optical nature of color in order to improve color in fabrics. Chevreul realized It was the eye, and not the dye, that had the greatest influence on color, and from this, he revolutionized color theory by grasping what came to be called the law of simultaneous contrast: that colors mutually influence one another when juxtaposed, each imposing its own complementary color on the other. The French painter Eugène Delacroix, who had been experimenting with what he called broken tones, embraced Chevreul&#x27;s book, &quot;The Law of Contrast of Color&quot; (1839) with its explanations of how juxtaposed colors can enhance or diminish each other, and his exploration of all the visible colors of the spectrum. Inspired by Chevreul&#x27;s 1839 treatise, Delacroix passed his enthusiasm on to the young artists who were inspired by him. It was Chevreul who led the Impressionists to grasp that they should apply separate brushstrokes of pure color to a canvas and allow the viewer&#x27;s eye to combine them optically.

They were aided greatly in this by innovations in oil paint itself. Since the Renaissance, painters had to grind pigment, add oil and thus create their own paints; these time-consuming paints also quickly dried out, making studio painting a necessity for large works, and limiting painters to mix one or two colors at a time and fill in an entire area using just that one color before it dried out. In 1841, a little-known American painter named John G. Rand invented a simple improvement without which the Impressionist movement could not have occurred: the small, flexible tin tube with removable cap in which oil paints could be stored. Oil paints kept in such tubes stayed moist, usable, and portable. For the first time since the Renaissance, painters were not trapped by the time frame of how quickly oil paint dried.

Paints in tubes could be easily loaded up and carried out into the real world, to directly observe the play of color and natural light, in shadow and movement, to paint in the moment. Selling the oil paint in tubes also brought about the arrival of dazzling new pigments - chrome yellow, cadmium blue - invented by 19th century industrial chemists. The tubes freed the Impressionists to paint quickly, and across an entire canvas, rather than carefully delineated single-color sections at a time; in short, to sketch directly in oil - racing across the canvas in every color that came to hand and thus inspiring their name of &quot;impressionists&quot; - since such speedy, bold brushwork and dabs of separate colors made contemporary critics think their paintings were mere impressions, not finished paintings, which were to have no visible brush marks at all, seamless under layers of varnish.

Pierre-Auguste Renoir said, “Without colors in tubes, there would be no Cézanne, no Monet, no Pissarro, and no Impressionism.”

Finally, the careful, hyper-realistic techniques of French neo-classicism were seen as stiff and lifeless when compared to the remarkable new vision of the world as seen through the new invention of photography by the mid-1850s. It was not merely that the increasing ability of this new invention, particularly by the French inventor Daguerre, made the realism of the painted image redundant as he deliberately competed in the Paris diorama with large-scale historical paintings. The neo-classical subject matter, limited by Academic tradition to Greek and Roman legends, historical battles and Biblical stories, seemed oppressively clichéd and limited to artists eager to explore the actual world in front of their own eyes revealed by the camera - daily life, candid groupings of everyday people doing simple things, Paris itself, rural landscapes and most particularly the play of captured light - not the imaginary lionizing of unseen past events. Early photographs influenced Impressionist style by its use of asymmetry, cropping and most obviously the blurring of motion, as inadvertently captured in the very slow speeds of early photography.

Edgar Degas, Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir - in their framing, use of color, light and shadow, subject matter - put these innovations to work to create a new language of visual beauty and meaning.

== Faking revolution: the CIA and Abstract Expressionism ==

Their initial break with realism into an exploration of light, color and the nature of paint was brought to an ultimate conclusion by the abstract expressionists who broke away from recognizable content of any kind into works of pure shape, color and painterliness which emerged at the end of the Second World War. At first thought of as primitive, inept works - as in &quot;my four year old could do that - these works were misunderstood and neglected until given critical and support by the rise of art journalists and critics who championed their work in the 1940s and 50s, expressing the power of such work in aesthetic terms the artists themselves seldom used, or even understood. Jackson Pollock who pioneered splatter painting, dispensing with a paint brush altogether, soon became lionized as the angry young man in a large spread in &quot;Life&quot; magazine.

In fact, in a deliberate, secret and successful effort to separate artistic revolutions from political ones, abstract expressionists like Pollock, Robert Motherwell, Willem de Kooning and Mark Rothko, while seemingly difficult, pathbreaking artists, were in fact secretly supported for twenty years by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in a Cold War policy begun in 1947 to prove that the United States could foster more artistic freedom than the Soviet bloc. &quot;It was recognized that Abstract Expressionism was the kind of art that made Socialist Realism look even more stylized and rigid and confined than it was,&quot; said former CIA case worker Donald Jameson, who finally broke the silence on this program in 1995. Ironically, the covert CIA support for these radical works was required because an attempt to use government funds for a European tour of these works during the Truman administration led to a public uproar in conservative McCarthy-era America, with Truman famously remarking, &quot;If that&#x27;s art, I&#x27;m a Hottentot.&quot; Thus, the program was hidden under the guise of fabricated foundations and the support of wealthy patrons who were actually using CIA funds, not their own, to sponsor traveling exhibitions of American abstract expressionists all over the world, publish books and articles praising them and to purchase and exhibit abstract expressionist works in major American and British museums. Thomas Braden, in charge of these cultural programs for the CIA, in the early years of the Cold War, had formerly been executive secretary of the Museum of Modern Art, America&#x27;s leading institution for 20th century art and the charges of collusion between the two echoed for many years after this program was revealed, though most of the artists involved had no idea they were being used in this way and were furious when they found out.

<doc id="1193" wikidata="Q492050" url="?curid=1193" title="Agrarianism">
<text>Agrarianism is a social and political philosophy that advocates for rural development, a rural agricultural lifestyle, family farming, widespread property ownership, and political decentralization. Those who adhere to agrarianism tend to value traditional forms of local community over urban modernity. Agrarian political parties sometimes aim to support the rights and sustainability of small farmers and poor peasants against the wealthy, powerful and famous in society.

== Philosophy ==
Some scholars suggest that agrarianism espouses the superiority of rural society to urban society and the independent farmer as superior to the paid worker, and sees farming as a way of life that can shape the ideal social values. It stresses the superiority of a simpler rural life in comparison to the complexity of urban life. For example, M. Thomas Inge defines agrarianism by the following basic tenets:
* Farming is the sole occupation that offers total independence and self-sufficiency.
* Urban life, fascism, capitalism, and technology destroy independence and dignity and foster vice and weakness.
* The agricultural community, with its fellowship of labor and co-operation, is the model society.
* The farmer has a solid, stable position in the world order. They have &quot;a sense of identity, a sense of historical and religious tradition, a feeling of belonging to a concrete family, place, and region, which are psychologically and culturally beneficial.&quot; The harmony of their life checks the encroachments of a fragmented, alienated modern society.
* Cultivation of the soil &quot;has within it a positive spiritual good&quot; and from it the cultivator acquires the virtues of &quot;honor, manliness, self-reliance, courage, moral integrity, and hospitality.&quot; They result from a direct contact with nature and, through nature, a closer relationship to God. The agrarian is blessed in that they follow the example of God in creating order out of chaos.

==History==

The philosophical roots of agrarianism include European and Chinese philosophers. The Chinese school of Agriculturalism (农家/農家) was a philosophy that advocated peasant utopian communalism and egalitarianism. In societies influenced by Confucianism that had as its foundation that humans are innately good, the farmer was considered an esteemed productive member of society, but merchants who made money were looked down upon. That influenced European intellectuals like François Quesnay, an avid Confucianist and advocate of China&#x27;s agrarian policies, in forming the French agrarian philosophy of physiocracy. The physiocrats, along with the ideas of John Locke and the Romantic Era, formed the basis of modern European and American agrarianism.

==Types of agrarianism==
===Physiocracy===
===Jeffersonian democracy===

The United States president Thomas Jefferson was an agrarian who based his ideas about the budding American democracy around the notion that farmers are &quot;the most valuable citizens&quot; and the truest republicans. Jefferson and his support base were committed to American republicanism, which they saw as being in opposition to monarchy, aristocracy, clericalism and corruption, and which prioritized morality and virtue, exemplified by the &quot;yeoman farmer&quot;, &quot;planters&quot;, and the &quot;plain folk&quot;. In praising the rural farmfolk, the Jeffersonians felt that financiers, bankers and industrialists created &quot;cesspools of corruption&quot; in the cities and should thus be avoided.

The Jeffersonians sought to align the American economy more with agriculture than industry. Part of their motive to do so was Jefferson&#x27;s fear that the over-industrialization of America would create a class of wage slaves who relied on their employers for income and sustenance. In turn, these workers would cease to be independent voters as their vote could be manipulated by said employers. To counter this, Jefferson introduced, as scholar Clay Jenkinson noted, &quot;a graduated income tax that would serve as a disincentive to vast accumulations of wealth and would make funds available for some sort of benign redistribution downward&quot; and tariffs on imported articles, which were mainly purchased by the wealthy. In 1811, Jefferson, writing to a friend, explained: &quot;these revenues will be levied entirely on the rich... . the rich alone use imported articles, and on these alone the whole taxes of the general government are levied. the poor man ... pays not a farthing of tax to the general government, but on his salt.&quot;

There is general agreement that the substantial United States&#x27; federal policy of offering land grants (such as thousands of gifts of land to veterans) had a positive impact on economic development in the 19th century.

===Agrarian socialism===

Agrarian socialism is a form of agrarianism that is anti-capitalist in nature and seeks to introduce socialist economic systems in their stead.

====Zapatismo====

Notable agrarian socialists include Emiliano Zapata who was a leading figure in the Mexican Revolution. As part of the Liberation Army of the South, his group of revolutionaries fought on behalf of the Mexican peasants, whom they saw as exploited by the landowning classes. Zapata published the Plan of Ayala, which called for significant land reforms and land redistribution in Mexico as part of the revolution. Zapata was killed and his forces crushed over the course of the Revolution, but his political ideas lived on in the form of Zapatismo.

Zapatismo would form the basis for neozapatismo, the ideology of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation. Known as &quot;Ejército Zapatista de Liberación Nacional&quot; or EZLN in Spanish, EZLN is a far-left libertarian socialist political and militant group that emerged in the state of Chiapas in southmost Mexico in 1994. EZLN and Neozapatismo, as explicit in their name, seek to revive the agrarian socialist movement of Zapata, but fuse it with new elements such as a commitment to indigenous rights and community-level decision making.

Subcommander Marcos, a leading member of the movement, argues that the peoples&#x27; collective ownership of the land was and is the basis for all subsequent developments the movement sought to create:
...When the land became property of the peasants ... when the land passed into the hands of those who work it ... [This was] the starting point for advances in government, health, education, housing, nutrition, women&#x27;s participation, trade, culture, communication, and information ...[it was] recovering the means of production, in this case, the land, animals, and machines that were in the hands of large property owners.&quot;

====Maoism====
Maoism, the far-left ideology of Mao Zedong and his followers, places a heavy emphasis on the role of peasants in its goals. In contrast to other Marxist schools of thought which normally seek to acquire the support of urban workers, Maoism sees the peasantry as key. Believing that &quot;political power grows out of the barrel of a gun&quot;, Maoism saw the Chinese Peasantry as the prime source for a Marxist vanguard because it possessed two qualities: (i) they were poor, and (ii) they were a political blank slate; in Mao&#x27;s words, &quot;A clean sheet of paper has no blotches, and so the newest and most beautiful words can be written on it&quot;. During the Chinese Civil War and the Second Sino-Japanese War, Mao and the Chinese Communist Party made extensive use of peasants and rural bases in their military tactics, often eschewing the cities.

Following the eventual victory of the Communist Party in both wars, the countryside and how it should be run remained a focus for Mao. In 1958, Mao launched the Great Leap Forward, a social and economic campaign which, amongst other things, altered many aspects of rural Chinese life. It introduced mandatory collective farming and forced the peasantry to organize itself into communal living units which were known as people&#x27;s communes. These communes, which consisted of 5,000 people on average, were expected to meet high production quotas while the peasants who lived on them adapted to this radically new way of life. The communes were run as co-operatives where wages and money were replaced by work points. Peasants who criticised this new system were persecuted as &quot;rightists&quot; and &quot;counter-revolutionaries&quot;. Leaving the communes was forbidden and escaping from them was difficult or impossible, and those who attempted it were subjected to party-orchestrated &quot;public struggle sessions,&quot; which further jeopardized their survival. These public criticism sessions were often used to intimidate the peasants into obeying local officials and they often devolved into little more than public beatings.

On the communes, experiments were conducted in order to find new methods of planting crops, efforts were made to construct new irrigation systems on a massive scale, and the communes were all encouraged to produce steel backyard furnaces as part of an effort to increase steel production. However, following the Anti-Rightist Campaign, Mao had instilled a mass distrust of intellectuals into China, and thus engineers often were not consulted with regard to the new irrigation systems and the wisdom of asking untrained peasants to produce good quality steel from scrap iron was not publicly questioned. Similarly, the experimentation with the crops did not produce results. In addition to this the Four Pests Campaign was launched, in which the peasants were called upon to destroy sparrows and other wild birds that ate crop seeds, in order to protect fields. Pest birds were shot down or scared away from landing until they dropped from exhaustion. This campaign resulted in an ecological disaster that saw an explosion of the vermin population, especially crop-eating insects, which was consequently not in danger of being killed by predators.

None of these new systems were working, but local leaders did not dare to state this, instead, they falsified reports so as not to be punished for failing to meet the quotas. In many cases they stated that they were greatly exceeding their quotas, and in turn, the Chinese state developed a completely false sense of success with regard to the commune system.

All of this culminated in the Great Chinese Famine, which began in 1959, lasted 3 years, and saw an estimated 15 to 30 million Chinese people die. A combination of bad weather and the new, failed farming techniques that were introduced by the state led to massive shortages of food. By 1962, the Great Leap Forward was declared to be at an end.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Mao once again radically altered life in rural China with the launching of the Down to the Countryside Movement. As a response to the Great Chinese Famine, the Chinese President Liu Shaoqi began &quot;sending down&quot; urban youths to rural China in order to recover its population losses and alleviate overcrowding in the cities. However, Mao turned the practice into a political crusade, declaring that the sending down would strip the youth of any bourgeois tendencies by forcing them to learn from the unprivileged rural peasants. In reality, it was the Communist Party&#x27;s attempt to reign in the Red Guards, who had become uncontrollable during the course of the Cultural Revolution. 10% of the 1970 urban population of China was sent out to remote rural villages, often in Inner Mongolia. The villages, which were still poorly recovering from the effects of the Great Chinese Famine, did not have the excess resources that were needed to support the newcomers. Furthermore, the so-called &quot;sent-down youth&quot; had no agricultural experience and as a result, they were unaccustomed to the harsh lifestyle that existed in the countryside, and their unskilled labor in the villages provided little benefit to the agricultural sector. As a result, many of the sent-down youth died in the countryside. The relocation of the youths was originally intended to be permanent, but by the end of the Cultural Revolution, the Communist Party relented and some of those who had the capacity to return to the cities were allowed to do so.

In imitation of Mao&#x27;s policies, the Khmer Rouge of Cambodia (who were heavily funded and supported by the People&#x27;s Republic of China) created their own version of the Great Leap Forward which was known as &quot;Maha Lout Ploh&quot;. With the Great Leap Forward as its model, it had similarly disastrous effects, contributing to what is now known as the Cambodian genocide. As a part of the Maha Lout Ploh, the Khmer Rouge sought to create an entirely agrarian socialist society by forcibly relocating 100,000 people to move from Cambodia&#x27;s cities into newly created communes. The Khmer Rouge leader, Pol Pot sought to &quot;purify&quot; the country by setting it back to &quot;Year Zero&quot;, freeing it from &quot;corrupting influences&quot;. Besides trying to completely de-urbanize Cambodia, ethnic minorities were slaughtered along with anyone else who was suspected of being a &quot;reactionary&quot; or a member of the &quot;bourgeoisie&quot;, to the point that wearing glasses was seen as grounds for execution. The killings were only brought to an end when Cambodia was invaded by the neighboring socialist nation of Vietnam, whose army toppled the Khmer Rouge. However, with Cambodia&#x27;s entire society and economy in disarray, including its agricultural sector, the country still plunged into renewed famine due to vast food shortages. However, as international journalists began to report on the situation and send images of it out to the world, a massive international response was provoked, leading to one of the most concentrated relief efforts of its time.

==Notable agrarian parties==

Peasant parties first appeared across Eastern Europe between 1860 and 1910, when commercialized agriculture and world market forces disrupted traditional rural society, and the railway and growing literacy facilitated the work of roving organizers. Agrarian parties advocated land reforms to redistribute land on large estates among those who work it. They also wanted village cooperatives to keep the profit from crop sales in local hands and credit institutions to underwrite needed improvements. Many peasant parties were also nationalist parties because peasants often worked their land for the benefit of landlords of different ethnicity.

Peasant parties rarely had any power before World War I but some became influential in the interwar era, especially in Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia. For a while, in the 1920s and the 1930s, there was a Green International (International Agrarian Bureau) based on the peasant parties in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Serbia. It functioned primarily as an information center that spread the ideas of agrarianism and combating socialism on the left and landlords on the right and never launched any significant activities.

===Europe===

====Bulgaria====
In Bulgaria, the Bulgarian Agrarian National Union (BZNS) was organized in 1899 to resist taxes and build cooperatives. BZNS came to power in 1919 and introduced many economic, social, and legal reforms. However, conservative forces crushed BZNS in a 1923 coup and assassinated its leader, Aleksandar Stamboliyski (1879–1923). BZNS was made into a communist puppet group until 1989, when it reorganized as a genuine party.

====Czechoslovakia====
In Czechoslovakia, the Republican Party of Agricultural and Smallholder People often shared power in parliament as a partner in the five-party pětka coalition. The party&#x27;s leader, Antonín Švehla (1873–1933), was prime minister several times. It was consistently the strongest party, forming and dominating coalitions. It moved beyond its original agrarian base to reach middle-class voters. The party was banned by the National Front after the Second World War.

====France====
In France, the Hunting, Fishing, Nature, Tradition party is a moderate conservative, agrarian party, reaching a peak of 4.23% in the 2002 French presidential election. It would later on become affiliated to France&#x27;s main conservative party, Union for a Popular Movement. More recently, the Resistons! movement of Jean Lassalle espoused agrarianism.

====Hungary====
In Hungary, the first major agrarian party, the small-holders party was founded in 1908. The party became part of the government in the 1920s but lost influence in the government. A new party, the Independent Smallholders, Agrarian Workers and Civic Party was established in 1930 with a more radical program representing larger scale land redistribution initiatives. They implemented this program together with the other coalition parties after WWII. However, after 1949 the party was outlawed when a one-party system was introduced. They became part of the government again 1990–1994, and 1998–2002 after which they lost political support. The ruling Fidesz party has an agrarian faction, and promotes agrarian interest since 2010 with the emphasis now placed on supporting larger family farms versus small-holders.

====Ireland====

In the late 19th century, the Irish National Land League aimed to abolish landlordism in Ireland and enable tenant farmers to own the land they worked on. The &quot;Land War&quot; of 1878–1909 led to the Irish Land Acts, ending absentee landlords and ground rent and redistributing land among peasant farmers.

Post-independence, the Farmers&#x27; Party operated in the Irish Free State from 1922, folding into the National Centre Party in 1932. It was mostly supported by wealthy farmers in the east of Ireland.

Clann na Talmhan (Family of the Land; also called the &quot;National Agricultural Party&quot;) was founded in 1938. They focused more on the poor smallholders of the west, supporting land reclamation, afforestation, social democracy and rates reform. They formed part of the governing coalition of the Government of the 13th Dáil and Government of the 15th Dáil. Economic improvement in the 1960s saw farmers vote for other parties and Clann na Talmhan disbanded in 1965.

==== Kazakhstan ====
In Kazakhstan, the Peasants&#x27; Union, originally a communist organization, was formed as one of first agrarian parties in independent Kazakhstan and would win four seats in the 1994 legislative election. The Agrarian Party of Kazakhstan, led by Romin Madinov, was founded in 1999, which favored the privatization of agricultural land, developments towards rural infrastructure, as well as changes in the tax system in agrarian economy. The party would go on to win three Mäjilis seats in the 1999 legislative election and eventually unite with the Civic Party of Kazakhstan to form the pro-government Agrarian-Industrial Union of Workers (AIST) bloc that would be chaired by Madinov for the 2004 legislative election, with the AIST bloc winning 11 seats in the Mäjilis. From there, the bloc remained short-lived as it would merge with the ruling Nur Otan party in 2006.

Several other parties in Kazakhstan over the years have embraced agrarian policies in their programs in an effort to appeal towards a large rural Kazakh demographic base, which included Amanat, ADAL, and Respublica.

Since late 2000s, the &quot;Auyl&quot; People&#x27;s Democratic Patriotic Party remains the largest and most influential agrarian-oriented party in Kazakhstan, as its presidential candidate Jiguli Dairabaev had become the second-place frontrunner in the 2022 presidential election after sweeping 3.4% of the vote. In the 2023 legislative election, the Auyl party for the first time was represented the parliament after winning nine seats in the lower chamber Mäjilis. The party raises rural issues in regard to decaying villages, rural development and the agro-industrial complex, the issues of social security of the rural population, and has consistently opposed the ongoing rural flight in Kazakhstan.

====Latvia====
In Latvia, the Union of Greens and Farmers is supportive of traditional small farms and perceives them as more environmentally friendly than large-scale farming: Nature is threatened by development, while small farms are threatened by large industrial-scale farms.

====Lithuania====
In Lithuania, the government led by the Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union was in power between 2016 and 2020.

====Nordic countries====

====Poland====
In Poland, the Polish People&#x27;s Party (&quot;Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe&quot;, PSL) traces its tradition to an agrarian party in Austro-Hungarian-controlled Galician Poland. After the fall of the communist regime, PSL&#x27;s biggest success came in 1993 elections, where it won 132 out of 460 parliamentary seats. Since then, PSL&#x27;s support has steadily declined, until 2019, when they formed Polish Coalition with an anti-establishment, direct democracy Kukiz&#x27;15 party, and managed to get 8.5% of popular vote. Moreover, PSL tends to get much better results in local elections. In 2014 elections they have managed to get 23.88% of votes.

The right-wing Law and Justice party has also become supportive of agrarian policies in recent years and polls show that most of their support comes from rural areas. AGROunia resembles the features of agrarianism.

==== Romania ====

In Romania, older party parties from Transylvania, Moldavia, and Wallachia merged to become the National Peasants&#x27; Party (PNȚ) in 1926. Iuliu Maniu (1873–1953) was a prime minister with an agrarian cabinet from 1928 to 1930 and briefly in 1932–1933, but the Great Depression made proposed reforms impossible. The communist administration dissolved the party in 1947 (along with other historical parties such as the National Liberal Party), but it reformed in 1989 after they fell from power.

The reformed party, which also incorporated elements of Christian democracy in its ideology, governed Romania as part of the Romanian Democratic Convention (CDR) between 1996 and 2000.

====Serbia====
In Serbia, Nikola Pašić (1845–1926) and his People&#x27;s Radical Party dominated Serbian politics after 1903. The party also monopolized power in Yugoslavia from 1918 to 1929. During the dictatorship of the 1930s, the prime minister was from that party.

====Ukraine====
In Ukraine, the Radical Party of Oleh Lyashko has promised to purify the country of oligarchs &quot;with a pitchfork&quot;. The party advocates a number of traditional left-wing positions (a progressive tax structure, a ban on agricultural land sale and eliminating the illegal land market, a tenfold increase in budget spending on health, setting up primary health centres in every village) and mixes them with strong nationalist sentiments.

====United Kingdom====

In land law the heyday of English, Irish (and thus Welsh) agrarianism was to 1603, led by the Tudor royal advisors, who sought to maintain a broad pool of agricultural commoners from which to draw military men, against the interests of larger landowners who sought enclosure (meaning complete private control of common land, over which by custom and common law lords of the manor always enjoyed minor rights). The heyday was eroded by hundreds of Acts of Parliament to expressly permit enclosure, chiefly from 1650 to the 1810s. Politicians standing strongly as reactionaries to this included the Levellers, those anti-industrialists (Luddites) going beyond opposing new weaving technology and, later, radicals such as William Cobbett.

A high level of net national or local self-sufficiency has a strong base in campaigns and movements. In the 19th century such empowered advocates included Peelites and most Conservatives. The 20th century saw the growth or start of influential non-governmental organisations, such as the National Farmers&#x27; Union of England and Wales, Campaign for Rural England, Friends of the Earth (EWNI) and of the England Wales, Scottish and Northern Irish political parties prefixed by and focussed on Green politics. The 21st century has seen decarbonisation already in electricity markets. Following protests and charitable lobbying local food has seen growing market share, sometimes backed by wording in public policy papers and manifestos. The UK has many sustainability-prioritising businesses, green charity campaigns, events and lobby groups ranging from espousing allotment gardens (hobby community farming) through to a clear policy of local food and/or self-sustainability models.

===Oceania===

====Australia====
Historian F.K. Crowley finds that:

The National Party of Australia (formerly called the Country Party), from the 1920s to the 1970s, promulgated its version of agrarianism, which it called &quot;countrymindedness&quot;. The goal was to enhance the status of the graziers (operators of big sheep stations) and small farmers and justified subsidies for them.

====New Zealand====
The New Zealand Liberal Party aggressively promoted agrarianism in its heyday (1891–1912). The landed gentry and aristocracy ruled Britain at this time. New Zealand never had an aristocracy but its wealthy landowners largely controlled politics before 1891. The Liberal Party set out to change that by a policy it called &quot;populism.&quot; Richard Seddon had proclaimed the goal as early as 1884: &quot;It is the rich and the poor; it is the wealthy and the landowners against the middle and labouring classes. That, Sir, shows the real political position of New Zealand.&quot; The Liberal strategy was to create a large class of small landowning farmers who supported Liberal ideals. The Liberal government also established the basis of the later welfare state such as old age pensions and developed a system for settling industrial disputes, which was accepted by both employers and trade unions. In 1893, it extended voting rights to women, making New Zealand the first country in the world to do so.

To obtain land for farmers, the Liberal government from 1891 to 1911 purchased of Maori land. The government also purchased from large estate holders for subdivision and closer settlement by small farmers. The Advances to Settlers Act (1894) provided low-interest mortgages, and the agriculture department disseminated information on the best farming methods. The Liberals proclaimed success in forging an egalitarian, anti-monopoly land policy. The policy built up support for the Liberal Party in rural North Island electorates. By 1903, the Liberals were so dominant that there was no longer an organized opposition in Parliament.

=== North America ===
The United States and Canada both saw a rise of Agrarian-oriented parties in the early twentieth century as economic troubles motivated farming communities to become politically active. It has been proposed that different responses to agrarian protest largely determined the course of power generated by these newly energized rural factions. According to Sociologist Barry Eidlin:&quot;In the United States, Democrats adopted a co-optive response to farmer and labor protest, incorporating these constituencies into the New Deal coalition. In Canada, both mainstream parties adopted a coercive response, leaving these constituencies politically excluded and available for an independent left coalition.&quot;These reactions may have helped determine the outcome of agrarian power and political associations in the US and Canada.

==== United States of America ====

===== Kansas =====
Economic desperation experienced by farmers across the state of Kansas in the nineteenth century spurred the creation of The People&#x27;s Party in 1890, and soon-after would gain control of the governor&#x27;s office in 1892. This party, consisting of a mix of Democrats, Socialists, Populists, and Fusionists, would find itself buckling from internal conflict regarding the unlimited coinage of silver. The Populists permanently lost power in 1898.

===== Oklahoma =====
Oklahoma farmers considered their political activity during the early twentieth century due to the outbreak of war, depressed crop prices, and an inhibited sense of progression towards owning their own farms. Tenancy had been reportedly as high as 55% in Oklahoma by 1910. These pressures saw agrarian counties in Oklahoma supporting Socialist policies and politics, with the Socialist platform proposing a deeply agrarian-radical platform:...the platform proposed a &quot;Renters and Farmer&#x27;s Program&quot; which was strongly agrarian radical in its insistence upon various measures to put land into &quot;The hands of the actual tillers of the soil.&quot; Although it did not propose to nationalize privately owned land, it did offer numerous plans to enlarge the state&#x27;s public domain, from which land would be rented at prevailing share rents to tenants until they had paid rent equal to the land&#x27;s value. The tenant and his children would have the right of occupancy and use, but the &#x27;title&#x27; would remind in the &#x27;commonwealth&#x27;, an arrangement that might be aptly termed &#x27;Socialist fee simple&#x27;. They proposed to exempt from taxation all farm dwellings, animals, and improvements up to the value of $1,000. The State Board of Agriculture would encourage &#x27;co-operative societies&#x27; of farmers to make plans f or the purchase of land, seed, tools, and for preparing and selling produce. In order to give farmers essential services at cost, the Socialists called for the creation of state banks and mortgage agencies, crop insurance, elevators, and warehouses.This agrarian-backed Socialist party would win numerous offices, causing a panic within the local Democratic party. This agrarian-Socialist movement would be inhibited by voter suppression laws aimed at reducing the participation of voters of color, as well as national wartime policies intended to disrupt political elements considered subversive. This party would peak in power in 1914.

== Back-to-the-land movement ==
Agrarianism is similar to but not identical with the back-to-the-land movement. Agrarianism concentrates on the fundamental goods of the earth, on communities of more limited economic and political scale than in modern society, and on simple living, even when the shift involves questioning the &quot;progressive&quot; character of some recent social and economic developments. Thus, agrarianism is not industrial farming, with its specialization on products and industrial scale.

<doc id="1196" wikidata="Q11352" url="?curid=1196" title="Angle">
<text>In Euclidean geometry, an angle or plane angle is the figure formed by two rays, called the &quot;sides&quot; of the angle, sharing a common endpoint, called the &quot;vertex&quot; of the angle.
Two intersecting curves may also define an angle, which is the angle of the rays lying tangent to the respective curves at their point of intersection. Angles are also formed by the intersection of two planes; these are called &quot;dihedral angles&quot;. 
In any case, the resulting angle lies in a plane (spanned by the two rays or perpendicular to the line of plane-plane intersection).

The magnitude of an angle is called an angular measure or simply &quot;angle&quot;. Two different angles may have the same measure, as in an isosceles triangle. &quot;Angle&quot; also denotes the angular sector, the infinite region of the plane bounded by the sides of an angle.

&quot;Angle of rotation&quot; is a measure conventionally defined as the ratio of a circular arc length to its radius, and may be a negative number. In the case of an ordinary angle, the arc is centered at the vertex and delimited by the sides. In the case of an angle of rotation, the arc is centered at the center of the rotation and delimited by any other point and its image after the rotation.

==History and etymology==
The word &quot;angle&quot; comes from the Latin word , meaning &quot;corner&quot;. Cognate words include the Greek () meaning &quot;crooked, curved&quot; and the English word &quot;ankle&quot;. Both are connected with the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*ank-&quot;, meaning &quot;to bend&quot; or &quot;bow&quot;.
Euclid defines a plane angle as the inclination to each other, in a plane, of two lines that meet each other and do not lie straight with respect to each other. According to the Neoplatonic metaphysician Proclus, an angle must be either a quality, a quantity, or a relationship. The first concept, angle as quality, was used by Eudemus of Rhodes, who regarded an angle as a deviation from a straight line; the second, angle as quantity, by Carpus of Antioch, who regarded it as the interval or space between the intersecting lines; Euclid adopted the third: angle as a relationship.

==Identifying angles==
In mathematical expressions, it is common to use Greek letters (α, β, γ, θ, φ, . . . ) as variables denoting the size of some angle (the symbol is typically not used for this purpose to avoid confusion with the constant denoted by that symbol). Lower case Roman letters (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, . . . ) are also used. In contexts where this is not confusing, an angle may be denoted by the upper case Roman letter denoting its vertex. See the figures in this article for examples.

The three defining points may also identify angles in geometric figures. For example, the angle with vertex A formed by the rays AB and AC (that is, the half-lines from point A through points B and C) is denoted or formula_1. Where there is no risk of confusion, the angle may sometimes be referred to by a single vertex alone (in this case, &quot;angle A&quot;).

In other ways, an angle denoted as, say, might refer to any of four angles: the clockwise angle from B to C about A, the anticlockwise angle from B to C about A, the clockwise angle from C to B about A, or the anticlockwise angle from C to B about A, where the direction in which the angle is measured determines its sign (see &quot;). However, in many geometrical situations, it is evident from the context that the positive angle less than or equal to 180 degrees is meant, and in these cases, no ambiguity arises. Otherwise, to avoid ambiguity, specific conventions may be adopted so that, for instance, always refers to the anticlockwise (positive) angle from B to C about A and the anticlockwise (positive) angle from C to B about A.

==Types==
===Individual angles===
There is some common terminology for angles, whose measure is always non-negative (see &quot;):
* An angle equal to 0° or not turned is called a &quot;zero angle&quot;.
* An angle smaller than a right angle (less than 90°) is called an &quot;acute angle&quot; (&quot;acute&quot; meaning &quot;sharp&quot;).
* An angle equal to  turn (90° or radians) is called a &quot;right angle&quot;. Two lines that form a right angle are said to be &quot;normal&quot;, &quot;orthogonal&quot;, or &quot;perpendicular&quot;.
* An angle larger than a right angle and smaller than a straight angle (between 90° and 180°) is called an &quot;obtuse angle&quot; (&quot;obtuse&quot; meaning &quot;blunt&quot;).
* An angle equal to  turn (180° or radians) is called a &quot;straight angle&quot;.
* An angle larger than a straight angle but less than 1 turn (between 180° and 360°) is called a &quot;reflex angle&quot;.
* An angle equal to 1 turn (360° or 2 radians) is called a &quot;full angle&quot;, &quot;complete angle&quot;, &quot;round angle&quot; or &quot;perigon&quot;.
* An angle that is not a multiple of a right angle is called an &quot;oblique angle&quot;.

The names, intervals, and measuring units are shown in the table below:

===Vertical and angle pairs===

When two straight lines intersect at a point, four angles are formed. Pairwise, these angles are named according to their location relative to each other.

A transversal is a line that intersects a pair of (often parallel) lines and is associated with &quot;exterior angles&quot;, &quot;interior angles&quot;, &quot;alternate exterior angles&quot;, &quot;alternate interior angles&quot;, &quot;corresponding angles&quot;, and &quot;consecutive interior angles&quot;.

===Combining angle pairs===
The angle addition postulate states that if B is in the interior of angle AOC, then

formula_2

I.e., the measure of the angle AOC is the sum of the measure of angle AOB and the measure of angle BOC.

Three special angle pairs involve the summation of angles:


===Polygon-related angles===

* An angle that is part of a simple polygon is called an &quot;interior angle&quot; if it lies on the inside of that simple polygon. A simple concave polygon has at least one interior angle, that is, a reflex angle. In Euclidean geometry, the measures of the interior angles of a triangle add up to radians, 180°, or turn; the measures of the interior angles of a simple convex quadrilateral add up to 2 radians, 360°, or 1 turn. In general, the measures of the interior angles of a simple convex polygon with &quot;n&quot; sides add up to (&quot;n&quot; − 2) radians, or (&quot;n&quot; − 2)180 degrees, (&quot;n&quot; − 2)2 right angles, or (&quot;n&quot; − 2) turn.
* The supplement of an interior angle is called an &quot;exterior angle&quot;; that is, an interior angle and an exterior angle form a linear pair of angles. There are two exterior angles at each vertex of the polygon, each determined by extending one of the two sides of the polygon that meet at the vertex; these two angles are vertical and hence are equal. An exterior angle measures the amount of rotation one must make at a vertex to trace the polygon. If the corresponding interior angle is a reflex angle, the exterior angle should be considered negative. Even in a non-simple polygon, it may be possible to define the exterior angle. Still, one will have to pick an orientation of the plane (or surface) to decide the sign of the exterior angle measure. In Euclidean geometry, the sum of the exterior angles of a simple convex polygon, if only one of the two exterior angles is assumed at each vertex, will be one full turn (360°). The exterior angle here could be called a &quot;supplementary exterior angle&quot;. Exterior angles are commonly used in Logo Turtle programs when drawing regular polygons.
* In a triangle, the bisectors of two exterior angles and the bisector of the other interior angle are concurrent (meet at a single point).
* In a triangle, three intersection points, each of an external angle bisector with the opposite extended side, are collinear.
* In a triangle, three intersection points, two between an interior angle bisector and the opposite side, and the third between the other exterior angle bisector and the opposite side extended are collinear.
* Some authors use the name &quot;exterior angle&quot; of a simple polygon to mean the &quot;explement exterior angle&quot; (&quot;not&quot; supplement!) of the interior angle. This conflicts with the above usage.

===Plane-related angles===
* The angle between two planes (such as two adjacent faces of a polyhedron) is called a &quot;dihedral angle&quot;. It may be defined as the acute angle between two lines normal to the planes.
* The angle between a plane and an intersecting straight line is complementary to the angle between the intersecting line and the normal to the plane.

==Measuring angles==
The size of a geometric angle is usually characterized by the magnitude of the smallest rotation that maps one of the rays into the other. Angles of the same size are said to be &quot;equal&quot; &quot;congruent&quot; or &quot;equal in measure&quot;.

In some contexts, such as identifying a point on a circle or describing the &quot;orientation&quot; of an object in two dimensions relative to a reference orientation, angles that differ by an exact multiple of a full turn are effectively equivalent. In other contexts, such as identifying a point on a spiral curve or describing an object&#x27;s &quot;cumulative rotation&quot; in two dimensions relative to a reference orientation, angles that differ by a non-zero multiple of a full turn are not equivalent.

To measure an angle θ, a circular arc centered at the vertex of the angle is drawn, e.g., with a pair of compasses. The ratio of the length s of the arc by the radius r of the circle is the number of radians in the angle:
formula_3
Conventionally, in mathematics and the SI, the radian is treated as being equal to the dimensionless unit 1, thus being normally omitted.

The angle expressed by another angular unit may then be obtained by multiplying the angle by a suitable conversion constant of the form , where &quot;k&quot; is the measure of a complete turn expressed in the chosen unit (for example, for degrees or 400 grad for gradians):

formula_4

The value of thus defined is independent of the size of the circle: if the length of the radius is changed, then the arc length changes in the same proportion, so the ratio &quot;s&quot;/&quot;r&quot; is unaltered.

===Units===
Throughout history, angles have been measured in various units. These are known as angular units, with the most contemporary units being the degree ( ° ), the radian (rad), and the gradian (grad), though many others have been used throughout history. Most units of angular measurement are defined such that one turn (i.e., the angle subtended by the circumference of a circle at its centre) is equal to &quot;n&quot; units, for some whole number &quot;n&quot;. Two exceptions are the radian (and its decimal submultiples) and the diameter part.

In the International System of Quantities, an angle is defined as a dimensionless quantity, and in particular, the radian unit is dimensionless. This convention impacts how angles are treated in dimensional analysis.

The following table lists some units used to represent angles.

===Dimensional analysis===
===Signed angles ===


It is frequently helpful to impose a convention that allows positive and negative angular values to represent orientations and/or rotations in opposite directions or &quot;sense&quot; relative to some reference.

In a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, an angle is typically defined by its two sides, with its vertex at the origin. The &quot;initial side&quot; is on the positive x-axis, while the other side or &quot;terminal side&quot; is defined by the measure from the initial side in radians, degrees, or turns, with &quot;positive angles&quot; representing rotations toward the positive y-axis and &quot;negative angles&quot; representing rotations toward the negative &quot;y&quot;-axis. When Cartesian coordinates are represented by &quot;standard position&quot;, defined by the &quot;x&quot;-axis rightward and the &quot;y&quot;-axis upward, positive rotations are anticlockwise, and negative cycles are clockwise.

In many contexts, an angle of −&quot;θ&quot; is effectively equivalent to an angle of &quot;one full turn minus &quot;θ&quot;&quot;. For example, an orientation represented as −45° is effectively equal to an orientation defined as 360° − 45° or 315°. Although the final position is the same, a physical rotation (movement) of −45° is not the same as a rotation of 315° (for example, the rotation of a person holding a broom resting on a dusty floor would leave visually different traces of swept regions on the floor).

In three-dimensional geometry, &quot;clockwise&quot; and &quot;anticlockwise&quot; have no absolute meaning, so the direction of positive and negative angles must be defined in terms of an orientation, which is typically determined by a normal vector passing through the angle&#x27;s vertex and perpendicular to the plane in which the rays of the angle lie.

In navigation, bearings or azimuth are measured relative to north. By convention, viewed from above, bearing angles are positive clockwise, so a bearing of 45° corresponds to a north-east orientation. Negative bearings are not used in navigation, so a north-west orientation corresponds to a bearing of 315°.

===Equivalent angles===
* Angles that have the same measure (i.e., the same magnitude) are said to be &quot;equal&quot; or &quot;congruent&quot;. An angle is defined by its measure and is not dependent upon the lengths of the sides of the angle (e.g., all &quot;right angles&quot; are equal in measure).
* Two angles that share terminal sides, but differ in size by an integer multiple of a turn, are called &quot;coterminal angles&quot;.
* The &quot;reference angle&quot; (sometimes called &quot;related angle&quot;) for any angle &quot;θ&quot; in standard position is the positive acute angle between the terminal side of &quot;θ&quot; and the x-axis (positive or negative). Procedurally, the magnitude of the reference angle for a given angle may determined by taking the angle&#x27;s magnitude modulo turn, 180°, or radians, then stopping if the angle is acute, otherwise taking the supplementary angle, 180° minus the reduced magnitude. For example, an angle of 30 degrees is already a reference angle, and an angle of 150 degrees also has a reference angle of 30 degrees (180° − 150°). Angles of 210° and 510° correspond to a reference angle of 30 degrees as well (210° mod 180° = 30°, 510° mod 180° = 150° whose supplementary angle is 30°).

===Related quantities===
For an angular unit, it is definitional that the angle addition postulate holds. Some quantities related to angles where the angle addition postulate does not hold include:
* The &quot;slope&quot; or &quot;gradient&quot; is equal to the tangent of the angle; a gradient is often expressed as a percentage. For very small values (less than 5%), the slope of a line is approximately the measure in radians of its angle with the horizontal direction.
* The &quot;spread&quot; between two lines is defined in rational geometry as the square of the sine of the angle between the lines. As the sine of an angle and the sine of its supplementary angle are the same, any angle of rotation that maps one of the lines into the other leads to the same value for the spread between the lines.
* Although done rarely, one can report the direct results of trigonometric functions, such as the sine of the angle.

==Angles between curves==

The angle between a line and a curve (mixed angle) or between two intersecting curves (curvilinear angle) is defined to be the angle between the tangents at the point of intersection. Various names (now rarely, if ever, used) have been given to particular cases:—&quot;amphicyrtic&quot; (Gr. , on both sides, κυρτός, convex) or &quot;cissoidal&quot; (Gr. κισσός, ivy), biconvex; &quot;xystroidal&quot; or &quot;sistroidal&quot; (Gr. ξυστρίς, a tool for scraping), concavo-convex; &quot;amphicoelic&quot; (Gr. κοίλη, a hollow) or &quot;angulus lunularis&quot;, biconcave.

==Bisecting and trisecting angles==
The ancient Greek mathematicians knew how to bisect an angle (divide it into two angles of equal measure) using only a compass and straightedge but could only trisect certain angles. In 1837, Pierre Wantzel showed that this construction could not be performed for most angles.

==Dot product and generalisations==
In the Euclidean space, the angle &quot;θ&quot; between two Euclidean vectors u and v is related to their dot product and their lengths by the formula

formula_5

This formula supplies an easy method to find the angle between two planes (or curved surfaces) from their normal vectors and between skew lines from their vector equations.

===Inner product===
To define angles in an abstract real inner product space, we replace the Euclidean dot product ( · ) by the inner product formula_6, i.e.

formula_7

In a complex inner product space, the expression for the cosine above may give non-real values, so it is replaced with

formula_8

or, more commonly, using the absolute value, with

formula_9

The latter definition ignores the direction of the vectors. It thus describes the angle between one-dimensional subspaces formula_10 and formula_11 spanned by the vectors formula_12 and formula_13 correspondingly.

===Angles between subspaces===
The definition of the angle between one-dimensional subspaces formula_10 and formula_11 given by

formula_16

in a Hilbert space can be extended to subspaces of finite dimensions. Given two subspaces formula_17, formula_18 with formula_19, this leads to a definition of formula_20 angles called canonical or principal angles between subspaces.

===Angles in Riemannian geometry===
In Riemannian geometry, the metric tensor is used to define the angle between two tangents. Where &quot;U&quot; and &quot;V&quot; are tangent vectors and &quot;g&quot;&quot;ij&quot; are the components of the metric tensor &quot;G&quot;,

formula_21

===Hyperbolic angle===
A hyperbolic angle is an argument of a hyperbolic function just as the &quot;circular angle&quot; is the argument of a circular function. The comparison can be visualized as the size of the openings of a hyperbolic sector and a circular sector since the areas of these sectors correspond to the angle magnitudes in each case. Unlike the circular angle, the hyperbolic angle is unbounded. When the circular and hyperbolic functions are viewed as infinite series in their angle argument, the circular ones are just alternating series forms of the hyperbolic functions. This comparison of the two series corresponding to functions of angles was described by Leonhard Euler in &quot;Introduction to the Analysis of the Infinite&quot; (1748).

==Angles in geography and astronomy==
In geography, the location of any point on the Earth can be identified using a &quot;geographic coordinate system&quot;. This system specifies the latitude and longitude of any location in terms of angles subtended at the center of the Earth, using the equator and (usually) the Greenwich meridian as references.

In astronomy, a given point on the celestial sphere (that is, the apparent position of an astronomical object) can be identified using any of several &quot;astronomical coordinate systems&quot;, where the references vary according to the particular system. Astronomers measure the &quot;angular separation&quot; of two stars by imagining two lines through the center of the Earth, each intersecting one of the stars. The angle between those lines and the angular separation between the two stars can be measured.

In both geography and astronomy, a sighting direction can be specified in terms of a vertical angle such as altitude /elevation with respect to the horizon as well as the azimuth with respect to north.

Astronomers also measure objects&#x27; &quot;apparent size&quot; as an angular diameter. For example, the full moon has an angular diameter of approximately 0.5° when viewed from Earth. One could say, &quot;The Moon&#x27;s diameter subtends an angle of half a degree.&quot; The small-angle formula can convert such an angular measurement into a distance/size ratio.

Other astronomical approximations include:
* 0.5° is the approximate diameter of the Sun and of the Moon as viewed from Earth.
* 1° is the approximate width of the little finger at arm&#x27;s length.
* 10° is the approximate width of a closed fist at arm&#x27;s length.
* 20° is the approximate width of a handspan at arm&#x27;s length.
These measurements depend on the individual subject, and the above should be treated as rough rule of thumb approximations only.

In astronomy, right ascension and declination are usually measured in angular units, expressed in terms of time, based on a 24-hour day.

<text>Acoustics is a branch of physics that deals with the study of mechanical waves in gases, liquids, and solids including topics such as vibration, sound, ultrasound and infrasound. A scientist who works in the field of acoustics is an acoustician while someone working in the field of acoustics technology may be called an acoustical engineer. The application of acoustics is present in almost all aspects of modern society with the most obvious being the audio and noise control industries.

Hearing is one of the most crucial means of survival in the animal world and speech is one of the most distinctive characteristics of human development and culture. Accordingly, the science of acoustics spreads across many facets of human society—music, medicine, architecture, industrial production, warfare and more. Likewise, animal species such as songbirds and frogs use sound and hearing as a key element of mating rituals or for marking territories. Art, craft, science and technology have provoked one another to advance the whole, as in many other fields of knowledge. Robert Bruce Lindsay&#x27;s &quot;Wheel of Acoustics&quot; is a well-accepted overview of the various fields in acoustics.

== History ==

=== Etymology ===
The word &quot;acoustic&quot; is derived from the Greek word ἀκουστικός (&quot;akoustikos&quot;), meaning &quot;of or for hearing, ready to hear&quot; and that from ἀκουστός (&quot;akoustos&quot;), &quot;heard, audible&quot;, which in turn derives from the verb ἀκούω(&quot;akouo&quot;), &quot;I hear&quot;.

The Latin synonym is &quot;sonic&quot;, after which the term sonics used to be a synonym for acoustics and later a branch of acoustics. Frequencies above and below the audible range are called &quot;ultrasonic&quot; and &quot;infrasonic&quot;, respectively.

=== Early research in acoustics ===
In the 6th century BC, the ancient Greek philosopher Pythagoras wanted to know why some combinations of musical sounds seemed more beautiful than others, and he found answers in terms of numerical ratios representing the harmonic overtone series on a string. He is reputed to have observed that when the lengths of vibrating strings are expressible as ratios of integers (e.g. 2 to 3, 3 to 4), the tones produced will be harmonious, and the smaller the integers the more harmonious the sounds. For example, a string of a certain length would sound particularly harmonious with a string of twice the length (other factors being equal). In modern parlance, if a string sounds the note C when plucked, a string twice as long will sound a C an octave lower. In one system of musical tuning, the tones in between are then given by 16:9 for D, 8:5 for E, 3:2 for F, 4:3 for G, 6:5 for A, and 16:15 for B, in ascending order.

Aristotle (384–322 BC) understood that sound consisted of compressions and rarefactions of air which &quot;falls upon and strikes the air which is next to it...&quot;, a very good expression of the nature of wave motion. &quot;On Things Heard&quot;, generally ascribed to Strato of Lampsacus, states that the pitch is related to the frequency of vibrations of the air and to the speed of sound.

In about 20 BC, the Roman architect and engineer Vitruvius wrote a treatise on the acoustic properties of theaters including discussion of interference, echoes, and reverberation—the beginnings of architectural acoustics. In Book V of his (&quot;The Ten Books of Architecture&quot;) Vitruvius describes sound as a wave comparable to a water wave extended to three dimensions, which, when interrupted by obstructions, would flow back and break up following waves. He described the ascending seats in ancient theaters as designed to prevent this deterioration of sound and also recommended bronze vessels (echea) of appropriate sizes be placed in theaters to resonate with the fourth, fifth and so on, up to the double octave, in order to resonate with the more desirable, harmonious notes.

During the Islamic golden age, Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī (973–1048) is believed to have postulated that the speed of sound was much slower than the speed of light.

The physical understanding of acoustical processes advanced rapidly during and after the Scientific Revolution. Mainly Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) but also Marin Mersenne (1588–1648), independently, discovered the complete laws of vibrating strings (completing what Pythagoras and Pythagoreans had started 2000 years earlier). Galileo wrote &quot;Waves are produced by the vibrations of a sonorous body, which spread through the air, bringing to the tympanum of the ear a stimulus which the mind interprets as sound&quot;, a remarkable statement that points to the beginnings of physiological and psychological acoustics. Experimental measurements of the speed of sound in air were carried out successfully between 1630 and 1680 by a number of investigators, prominently Mersenne. Inspired by Mersenne&#x27;s &quot;Harmonie universelle&quot; (&quot;Universal Harmony&quot;) or 1634, the Rome-based Jesuit scholar Athanasius Kircher undertook research in acoustics. Kircher published two major books on acoustics: the &quot;Musurgia universalis&quot; (&quot;Universal Music-Making&quot;) in 1650 and the &quot;Phonurgia nova&quot; (&quot;New Sound-Making&quot;) in 1673. Meanwhile, Newton (1642–1727) derived the relationship for wave velocity in solids, a cornerstone of physical acoustics (Principia, 1687).

=== Age of Enlightenment and onward ===
Substantial progress in acoustics, resting on firmer mathematical and physical concepts, was made during the eighteenth century by Euler (1707–1783), Lagrange (1736–1813), and d&#x27;Alembert (1717–1783). During this era, continuum physics, or field theory, began to receive a definite mathematical structure. The wave equation emerged in a number of contexts, including the propagation of sound in air.

In the nineteenth century the major figures of mathematical acoustics were Helmholtz in Germany, who consolidated the field of physiological acoustics, and Lord Rayleigh in England, who combined the previous knowledge with his own copious contributions to the field in his monumental work &quot;The Theory of Sound&quot; (1877). Also in the 19th century, Wheatstone, Ohm, and Henry developed the analogy between electricity and acoustics.

The twentieth century saw a burgeoning of technological applications of the large body of scientific knowledge that was by then in place. The first such application was Sabine&#x27;s groundbreaking work in architectural acoustics, and many others followed. Underwater acoustics was used for detecting submarines in the first World War. Sound recording and the telephone played important roles in a global transformation of society. Sound measurement and analysis reached new levels of accuracy and sophistication through the use of electronics and computing. The ultrasonic frequency range enabled wholly new kinds of application in medicine and industry. New kinds of transducers (generators and receivers of acoustic energy) were invented and put to use.

== Definition ==
Acoustics is defined by ANSI/ASA S1.1-2013 as &quot;(a) Science of sound, including its production, transmission, and effects, including biological and psychological effects. (b) Those qualities of a room that, together, determine its character with respect to auditory effects.&quot;

The study of acoustics revolves around the generation, propagation and reception of mechanical waves and vibrations.

The steps shown in the above diagram can be found in any acoustical event or process. There are many kinds of cause, both natural and volitional. There are many kinds of transduction process that convert energy from some other form into sonic energy, producing a sound wave. There is one fundamental equation that describes sound wave propagation, the acoustic wave equation, but the phenomena that emerge from it are varied and often complex. The wave carries energy throughout the propagating medium. Eventually this energy is transduced again into other forms, in ways that again may be natural and/or volitionally contrived. The final effect may be purely physical or it may reach far into the biological or volitional domains. The five basic steps are found equally well whether we are talking about an earthquake, a submarine using sonar to locate its foe, or a band playing in a rock concert.

The central stage in the acoustical process is wave propagation. This falls within the domain of physical acoustics. In fluids, sound propagates primarily as a pressure wave. In solids, mechanical waves can take many forms including longitudinal waves, transverse waves and surface waves.

Acoustics looks first at the pressure levels and frequencies in the sound wave and how the wave interacts with the environment. This interaction can be described as either a diffraction, interference or a reflection or a mix of the three. If several media are present, a refraction can also occur. Transduction processes are also of special importance to acoustics.

== Fundamental concepts ==
=== Wave propagation: pressure levels ===

In fluids such as air and water, sound waves propagate as disturbances in the ambient pressure level. While this disturbance is usually small, it is still noticeable to the human ear. The smallest sound that a person can hear, known as the threshold of hearing, is nine orders of magnitude smaller than the ambient pressure. The loudness of these disturbances is related to the sound pressure level (SPL) which is measured on a logarithmic scale in decibels.

=== Wave propagation: frequency ===
Physicists and acoustic engineers tend to discuss sound pressure levels in terms of frequencies, partly because this is how our ears interpret sound. What we experience as &quot;higher pitched&quot; or &quot;lower pitched&quot; sounds are pressure vibrations having a higher or lower number of cycles per second. In a common technique of acoustic measurement, acoustic signals are sampled in time, and then presented in more meaningful forms such as octave bands or time frequency plots. Both of these popular methods are used to analyze sound and better understand the acoustic phenomenon.

The entire spectrum can be divided into three sections: audio, ultrasonic, and infrasonic. The audio range falls between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. This range is important because its frequencies can be detected by the human ear. This range has a number of applications, including speech communication and music. The ultrasonic range refers to the very high frequencies: 20,000 Hz and higher. This range has shorter wavelengths which allow better resolution in imaging technologies. Medical applications such as ultrasonography and elastography rely on the ultrasonic frequency range. On the other end of the spectrum, the lowest frequencies are known as the infrasonic range. These frequencies can be used to study geological phenomena such as earthquakes.

Analytic instruments such as the spectrum analyzer facilitate visualization and measurement of acoustic signals and their properties. The spectrogram produced by such an instrument is a graphical display of the time varying pressure level and frequency profiles which give a specific acoustic signal its defining character.

=== Transduction in acoustics ===

A transducer is a device for converting one form of energy into another. In an electroacoustic context, this means converting sound energy into electrical energy (or vice versa). Electroacoustic transducers include loudspeakers, microphones, particle velocity sensors, hydrophones and sonar projectors. These devices convert a sound wave to or from an electric signal. The most widely used transduction principles are electromagnetism, electrostatics and piezoelectricity.

The transducers in most common loudspeakers (e.g. woofers and tweeters), are electromagnetic devices that generate waves using a suspended diaphragm driven by an electromagnetic voice coil, sending off pressure waves. Electret microphones and condenser microphones employ electrostatics—as the sound wave strikes the microphone&#x27;s diaphragm, it moves and induces a voltage change. The ultrasonic systems used in medical ultrasonography employ piezoelectric transducers. These are made from special ceramics in which mechanical vibrations and electrical fields are interlinked through a property of the material itself.

==Acoustician==

An acoustician is an expert in the science of sound.

===Education===
There are many types of acoustician, but they usually have a Bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher qualification. Some possess a degree in acoustics, while others enter the discipline via studies in fields such as physics or engineering. Much work in acoustics requires a good grounding in Mathematics and science. Many acoustic scientists work in research and development. Some conduct basic research to advance our knowledge of the perception (e.g. hearing, psychoacoustics or neurophysiology) of speech, music and noise. Other acoustic scientists advance understanding of how sound is affected as it moves through environments, e.g. underwater acoustics, architectural acoustics or structural acoustics. Other areas of work are listed under subdisciplines below. Acoustic scientists work in government, university and private industry laboratories. Many go on to work in Acoustical Engineering. Some positions, such as Faculty (academic staff) require a Doctor of Philosophy.

== Subdisciplines ==

===Archaeoacoustics===
Archaeoacoustics, also known as the archaeology of sound, is one of the only ways to experience the past with senses other than our eyes. Archaeoacoustics is studied by testing the acoustic properties of prehistoric sites, including caves. Iegor Rezkinoff, a sound archaeologist, studies the acoustic properties of caves through natural sounds like humming and whistling. Archaeological theories of acoustics are focused around ritualistic purposes as well as a way of echolocation in the caves. In archaeology, acoustic sounds and rituals directly correlate as specific sounds were meant to bring ritual participants closer to a spiritual awakening. Parallels can also be drawn between cave wall paintings and the acoustic properties of the cave; they are both dynamic. Because archaeoacoustics is a fairly new archaeological subject, acoustic sound is still being tested in these prehistoric sites today.

===Aeroacoustics===
Aeroacoustics is the study of noise generated by air movement, for instance via turbulence, and the movement of sound through the fluid air. This knowledge was applied in the 1920s and &#x27;30s to detect aircraft before radar was invented and is applied in acoustical engineering to study how to quieten aircraft. Aeroacoustics is important for understanding how wind musical instruments work.

===Acoustic signal processing===
Acoustic signal processing is the electronic manipulation of acoustic signals. Applications include: active noise control; design for hearing aids or cochlear implants; echo cancellation; music information retrieval, and perceptual coding (e.g. MP3 or Opus).

===Architectural acoustics===

Architectural acoustics (also known as building acoustics) involves the scientific understanding of how to achieve good sound within a building. It typically involves the study of speech intelligibility, speech privacy, music quality, and vibration reduction in the built environment. Commonly studied environments are hospitals, classrooms, dwellings, performance venues, recording and broadcasting studios. Focus considerations include room acoustics, airborne and impact transmission in building structures, airborne and structure-borne noise control, noise control of building systems and electroacoustic systems.

===Bioacoustics===
Bioacoustics is the scientific study of the hearing and calls of animal calls, as well as how animals are affected by the acoustic and sounds of their habitat.

===Electroacoustics===
This subdiscipline is concerned with the recording, manipulation and reproduction of audio using electronics. This might include products such as mobile phones, large scale public address systems or virtual reality systems in research laboratories.

===Environmental noise and soundscapes===

Environmental acoustics is the study of noise and vibrations, and their impact on structures, objects, humans, and animals. 

The main aim of these studies is to reduce levels of environmental noise and vibration. Typical work and research within environmental acoustics concerns the development of models used in simulations, measurement techniques, noise mitigation strategies, and the development of standards and regulations. Research work now also has a focus on the positive use of sound in urban environments: soundscapes and tranquility. 

Examples of noise and vibration sources include railways, road traffic, aircraft, industrial equipment and recreational activities. 

===Musical acoustics===
Musical acoustics is the study of the physics of acoustic instruments; the audio signal processing used in electronic music; the computer analysis of music and composition, and the perception and cognitive neuroscience of music.

===Psychoacoustics===

Many studies have been conducted to identify the relationship between acoustics and cognition, or more commonly known as psychoacoustics, in which what one hears is a combination of perception and biological aspects. The information intercepted by the passage of sound waves through the ear is understood and interpreted through the brain, emphasizing the connection between the mind and acoustics. Psychological changes have been seen as brain waves slow down or speed up as a result of varying auditory stimulus which can in turn affect the way one thinks, feels, or even behaves. This correlation can be viewed in normal, everyday situations in which listening to an upbeat or uptempo song can cause one&#x27;s foot to start tapping or a slower song can leave one feeling calm and serene. In a deeper biological look at the phenomenon of psychoacoustics, it was discovered that the central nervous system is activated by basic acoustical characteristics of music. By observing how the central nervous system, which includes the brain and spine, is influenced by acoustics, the pathway in which acoustic affects the mind, and essentially the body, is evident.

===Speech===
Acousticians study the production, processing and perception of speech. Speech recognition and Speech synthesis are two important areas of speech processing using computers. The subject also overlaps with the disciplines of physics, physiology, psychology, and linguistics.

===Structural Vibration and Dynamics===
Structural acoustics is the study of motions and interactions of mechanical systems with their environments and the methods of their measurement, analysis, and control. There are several sub-disciplines found within this regime:
* Modal Analysis
* Material characterization
* Structural health monitoring
* Acoustic Metamaterials
* Friction Acoustics

Applications might include: ground vibrations from railways; vibration isolation to reduce vibration in operating theatres; studying how vibration can damage health (vibration white finger); vibration control to protect a building from earthquakes, or measuring how structure-borne sound moves through buildings.

===Ultrasonics===
Ultrasonics deals with sounds at frequencies too high to be heard by humans. Specialisms include medical ultrasonics (including medical ultrasonography), sonochemistry, ultrasonic testing, material characterisation and underwater acoustics (sonar).

===Underwater acoustics===
Underwater acoustics is the scientific study of natural and man-made sounds underwater. Applications include sonar to locate submarines, underwater communication by whales, climate change monitoring by measuring sea temperatures acoustically, sonic weapons, and marine bioacoustics.

<doc id="1200" wikidata="Q26383" url="?curid=1200" title="Atomic physics">
<text>Atomic physics is the field of physics that studies atoms as an isolated system of electrons and an atomic nucleus. Atomic physics typically refers to the study of atomic structure and the interaction between atoms. It is primarily concerned with the way in which electrons are arranged around the nucleus and
the processes by which these arrangements change. This comprises ions, neutral atoms and, unless otherwise stated, it can be assumed that the term &quot;atom&quot; includes ions.

The term &quot;atomic physics&quot; can be associated with nuclear power and nuclear weapons, due to the synonymous use of &quot;atomic&quot; and &quot;nuclear&quot; in standard English. Physicists distinguish between atomic physics—which deals with the atom as a system consisting of a nucleus and electrons—and nuclear physics, which studies nuclear reactions and special properties of atomic nuclei.

As with many scientific fields, strict delineation can be highly contrived and atomic physics is often considered in the wider context of atomic, molecular, and optical physics. Physics research groups are usually so classified.

==Isolated atoms==
Atomic physics primarily considers atoms in isolation. Atomic models will consist of a single nucleus that may be surrounded by one or more bound electrons. It is not concerned with the formation of molecules (although much of the physics is identical), nor does it examine atoms in a solid state as condensed matter. It is concerned with processes such as ionization and excitation by photons or collisions with atomic particles.

While modelling atoms in isolation may not seem realistic, if one considers atoms in a gas or plasma then the time-scales for atom-atom interactions are huge in comparison to the atomic processes that are generally considered. This means that the individual atoms can be treated as if each were in isolation, as the vast majority of the time they are. By this consideration, atomic physics provides the underlying theory in plasma physics and atmospheric physics, even though both deal with very large numbers of atoms.

==Electronic configuration==
Electrons form notional shells around the nucleus. These are normally in a ground state but can be excited by the absorption of energy from light (photons), magnetic fields, or interaction with a colliding particle (typically ions or other electrons).

 Electrons that populate a shell are said to be in a bound state. The energy necessary to remove an electron from its shell (taking it to infinity) is called the binding energy. Any quantity of energy absorbed by the electron in excess of this amount is converted to kinetic energy according to the conservation of energy. The atom is said to have undergone the process of ionization.

If the electron absorbs a quantity of energy less than the binding energy, it will be transferred to an excited state. After a certain time, the electron in an excited state will &quot;jump&quot; (undergo a transition) to a lower state. In a neutral atom, the system will emit a photon of the difference in energy, since energy is conserved.

If an inner electron has absorbed more than the binding energy (so that the atom ionizes), then a more outer electron may undergo a transition to fill the inner orbital. In this case, a visible photon or a characteristic X-ray is emitted, or a phenomenon known as the Auger effect may take place, where the released energy is transferred to another bound electron, causing it to go into the continuum. The Auger effect allows one to multiply ionize an atom with a single photon.

There are rather strict selection rules as to the electronic configurations that can be reached by excitation by light — however, there are no such rules for excitation by collision processes.

===Bohr Model of the Atom===

The Bohr model, proposed by Niels Bohr in 1913, is a revolutionary theory describing the structure of the hydrogen atom. It introduced the idea of quantized orbits for electrons, combining classical and quantum physics.

Key Postulates of the Bohr Model

1. Electrons Move in Circular Orbits:

• Electrons revolve around the nucleus in fixed, circular paths called orbits or energy levels.

• These orbits are stable and do not radiate energy.

2. Quantization of Angular Momentum:

• The angular momentum of an electron is quantized and given by:

:formula_1

where:

• formula_2 Mass of the electron.

• formula_3 Velocity of the electron.

• formula_4 Radius of the orbit.

• formula_5 Reduced Planck’s constant (formula_6).

• formula_7 Principal quantum number, representing the orbit.

3. Energy Levels:

• Each orbit has a specific energy. The total energy of an electron in the formula_8th orbit is:

:formula_9

where formula_10 is the ground-state energy of the hydrogen atom.

4. Emission or Absorption of Energy:

• Electrons can transition between orbits by absorbing or emitting energy equal to the difference between the energy levels:

:formula_11

where:

• formula_12 Planck’s constant.

• formula_13 Frequency of emitted/absorbed radiation.

• formula_14 Final and initial energy levels.

==History and developments==

One of the earliest steps towards atomic physics was the recognition that matter was composed
of &quot;atoms&quot;. It forms a part of the texts written in 6th century BC to 2nd century BC, such as those of Democritus or &quot;&quot; written by . This theory was later developed in the modern sense of the basic unit of a chemical element by the British chemist and physicist John Dalton in the 18th century. At this stage, it was not clear what atoms were, although they could be described and classified by their properties (in bulk). The invention of the periodic system of elements by Dmitri Mendeleev was another great step forward.

The true beginning of atomic physics is marked by the discovery of spectral lines and attempts to describe the phenomenon, most notably by Joseph von Fraunhofer. The study of these lines led to the Bohr atom model and to the birth of quantum mechanics. In seeking to explain atomic spectra, an entirely new mathematical model of matter was revealed. As far as atoms and their electron shells were concerned, not only did this yield a better overall description, i.e. the atomic orbital model, but it also provided a new theoretical basis for chemistry
(quantum chemistry) and spectroscopy.

Since the Second World War, both theoretical and experimental fields have advanced at a rapid pace. This can be attributed to progress in computing technology, which has allowed larger and more sophisticated models of atomic structure and associated collision processes. Similar technological advances in accelerators, detectors, magnetic field generation and lasers have greatly assisted experimental work.

Beyond the well-known phenomena which can be describe with regular quantum mechanics chaotic processes can occur which need different descriptions.

<doc id="1201" wikidata="Q14759" url="?curid=1201" title="American Sign Language">
<text>American Sign Language (ASL) is a natural language that serves as the predominant sign language of Deaf communities in the United States and most of Anglophone Canada. ASL is a complete and organized visual language that is expressed by employing both manual and nonmanual features. Besides North America, dialects of ASL and ASL-based creoles are used in many countries around the world, including much of West Africa and parts of Southeast Asia. ASL is also widely learned as a second language, serving as a lingua franca. ASL is most closely related to French Sign Language (LSF). It has been proposed that ASL is a creole language of LSF, although ASL shows features atypical of creole languages, such as agglutinative morphology.

ASL originated in the early 19th century in the American School for the Deaf (ASD) in Hartford, Connecticut, from a situation of language contact. Since then, ASL use has been propagated widely by schools for the deaf and Deaf community organizations. Despite its wide use, no accurate count of ASL users has been taken. Reliable estimates for American ASL users range from 250,000 to 500,000 persons, including a number of children of deaf adults (CODA) and other hearing individuals.

Signs in ASL have a number of phonemic components, such as movement of the face, the torso, and the hands. ASL is not a form of pantomime, although iconicity plays a larger role in ASL than in spoken languages. English loan words are often borrowed through fingerspelling, although ASL grammar is unrelated to that of English. ASL has verbal agreement and aspectual marking and has a productive system of forming agglutinative classifiers. Many linguists believe ASL to be a subject–verb–object language. However, there are several alternative proposals to account for ASL word order.

== Classification ==
ASL emerged as a language in the American School for the Deaf (ASD), founded by Thomas Gallaudet in 1817, which brought together Old French Sign Language, various village sign languages, and home sign systems. ASL was created in that situation by language contact. ASL was influenced by its forerunners but distinct from all of them.

The influence of French Sign Language (LSF) on ASL is readily apparent; for example, it has been found that about 58% of signs in modern ASL are cognate to Old French Sign Language signs. However, that is far less than the standard 80% measure used to determine whether related languages are actually dialects. That suggests nascent ASL was highly affected by the other signing systems brought by the ASD students although the school&#x27;s original director, Laurent Clerc, taught in LSF. In fact, Clerc reported that he often learned the students&#x27; signs rather than conveying LSF:
It has been proposed that ASL is a creole in which LSF is the superstrate language and the native village sign languages are substrate languages. However, more recent research has shown that modern ASL does not share many of the structural features that characterize creole languages. ASL may have begun as a creole and then undergone structural change over time, but it is also possible that it was never a creole-type language. There are modality-specific reasons that signed languages tend towards agglutination, such as the ability to simultaneously convey information via the face, head, torso, and other body parts. That might override creole characteristics such as the tendency towards isolating morphology. Additionally, Clerc and Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet may have used an artificially constructed form of manually coded language in instruction rather than true LSF.

Although the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia share English as a common oral and written language, ASL is not mutually intelligible with either British Sign Language (BSL) or Auslan. All three languages show degrees of borrowing from English, but that alone is not sufficient for cross-language comprehension. It has been found that a relatively high percentage (37–44%) of ASL signs have similar translations in Auslan, which for oral languages would suggest that they belong to the same language family. However, that does not seem justified historically for ASL and Auslan, and it is likely that the resemblance is caused by the higher degree of iconicity in sign languages in general as well as contact with English.

American Sign Language is growing in popularity in many states. Many high school and university students desire to take it as a foreign language, but until recently, it was usually not considered a creditable foreign language elective. ASL users, however, have a very distinct culture, and they interact very differently when they talk. Their facial expressions and hand movements reflect what they are communicating. They also have their own sentence structure, which sets the language apart.

American Sign Language is now being accepted by many colleges as a language eligible for foreign language course credit; many states are making it mandatory to accept it as such. In some states however, this is only true with regard to high school coursework.

== History ==

Prior to the birth of ASL, sign language had been used by various communities in the United States. In the United States, as elsewhere in the world, hearing families with deaf children have historically employed ad hoc home sign, which often reaches much higher levels of sophistication than gestures used by hearing people in spoken conversation. As early as 1541 at first contact by Francisco Vásquez de Coronado, there were reports that the Indigenous peoples of the Great Plains widely spoke a sign language to communicate across vast national and linguistic lines.

In the 19th century, a &quot;triangle&quot; of village sign languages developed in New England: one in Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, Massachusetts; one in Henniker, New Hampshire, and one in Sandy River Valley, Maine. Martha&#x27;s Vineyard Sign Language (MVSL), which was particularly important for the history of ASL, was used mainly in Chilmark, Massachusetts. Due to intermarriage in the original community of English settlers of the 1690s, and the recessive nature of genetic deafness, Chilmark had a high 4% rate of genetic deafness. MVSL was used even by hearing residents whenever a deaf person was present, and also in some situations where spoken language would be ineffective or inappropriate, such as during church sermons or between boats at sea.

ASL is thought to have originated in the American School for the Deaf (ASD), founded in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1817. Originally known as &quot;The American Asylum, At Hartford, For The Education And Instruction Of The Deaf And Dumb&quot;, the school was founded by the Yale graduate and divinity student Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet. Gallaudet, inspired by his success in demonstrating the learning abilities of a young deaf girl Alice Cogswell, traveled to Europe in order to learn deaf pedagogy from European institutions. Ultimately, Gallaudet chose to adopt the methods of the French Institut National de Jeunes Sourds de Paris, and convinced Laurent Clerc, an assistant to the school&#x27;s founder Charles-Michel de l&#x27;Épée, to accompany him back to the United States. Upon his return, Gallaudet founded the ASD on April 15, 1817.

The largest group of students during the first seven decades of the school were from Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, and they brought MVSL with them. There were also 44 students from around Henniker, New Hampshire, and 27 from the Sandy River valley in Maine, each of which had their own village sign language. Other students brought knowledge of their own home signs. Laurent Clerc, the first teacher at ASD, taught using French Sign Language (LSF), which itself had developed in the Parisian school for the deaf established in 1755. From that situation of language contact, a new language emerged, now known as ASL.
More schools for the deaf were founded after ASD, and knowledge of ASL spread to those schools. In addition, the rise of Deaf community organizations bolstered the continued use of ASL. Societies such as the National Association of the Deaf and the National Fraternal Society of the Deaf held national conventions that attracted signers from across the country. All of that contributed to ASL&#x27;s wide use over a large geographical area, atypical of a sign language.

While oralism, an approach to educating deaf students focusing on oral language, had previously been used in American schools, the Milan Congress made it dominant and effectively banned the use of sign languages at schools in the United States and Europe. However, the efforts of Deaf advocates and educators, more lenient enforcement of the Congress&#x27;s mandate, and the use of ASL in religious education and proselytism ensured greater use and documentation compared to European sign languages, albeit more influenced by fingerspelled loanwords and borrowed idioms from English as students were societally pressured to achieve fluency in spoken language. Nevertheless, oralism remained the predominant method of deaf education up to the 1950s. Linguists did not consider sign language to be true &quot;language&quot; but as something inferior. Recognition of the legitimacy of ASL was achieved by William Stokoe, a linguist who arrived at Gallaudet University in 1955 when that was still the dominant assumption. Aided by the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, Stokoe argued for manualism, the use of sign language in deaf education. Stokoe noted that sign language shares the important features that oral languages have as a means of communication, and even devised a transcription system for ASL. In doing so, Stokoe revolutionized both deaf education and linguistics. In the 1960s, ASL was sometimes referred to as &quot;Ameslan&quot;, but that term is now considered obsolete.

== Population ==
Counting the number of ASL signers is difficult because ASL users have never been counted by the American census. The ultimate source for current estimates of the number of ASL users in the United States is a report for the National Census of the Deaf Population (NCDP) by Schein and Delk (1974). Based on a 1972 survey of the NCDP, Schein and Delk provided estimates consistent with a signing population between 250,000 and 500,000. The survey did not distinguish between ASL and other forms of signing; in fact, the name &quot;ASL&quot; was not yet in widespread use.

Incorrect figures are sometimes cited for the population of ASL users in the United States based on misunderstandings of known statistics. Demographics of the deaf population have been confused with those of ASL use since adults who become deaf late in life rarely use ASL in the home. That accounts for currently-cited estimations that are greater than 500,000; such mistaken estimations can reach as high as 15,000,000. A 100,000-person lower bound has been cited for ASL users; the source of that figure is unclear, but it may be an estimate of prelingual deafness, which is correlated with but not equivalent to signing.

ASL is sometimes incorrectly cited as the third- or fourth-most-spoken language in the United States. Those figures misquote Schein and Delk (1974), who actually concluded that ASL speakers constituted the third-largest population &quot;requiring an interpreter in court&quot;. Although that would make ASL the third-most used language among monolinguals other than English, it does not imply that it is the fourth-most-spoken language in the United States since speakers of other languages may also speak English.

==Geographic distribution==
ASL is used throughout Anglo-America. That contrasts with Europe, where a variety of sign languages are used within the same continent. The unique situation of ASL seems to have been caused by the proliferation of ASL through schools influenced by the American School for the Deaf, wherein ASL originated, and the rise of community organizations for the Deaf.

Throughout West Africa, ASL-based sign languages are signed by educated Deaf adults. Such languages, imported by boarding schools, are often considered by associations to be the official sign languages of their countries and are named accordingly, such as Nigerian Sign Language and Ghanaian Sign Language. Such signing systems are found in Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Liberia, Mauritania, Mali, Nigeria, and Togo. Due to lack of data, it is still an open question how similar those sign languages are to the variety of ASL used in America.

In addition to the aforementioned West African countries, ASL is reported to be used as a first language in Barbados, Bolivia, Cambodia (alongside Cambodian Sign Language), the Central African Republic, Chad, China (Hong Kong), the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Jamaica, Kenya, Madagascar, the Philippines, Singapore, and Zimbabwe. ASL is also used as a lingua franca throughout the deaf world, widely learned as a second language.

== Regional variation ==
=== Sign production ===
Sign production can often vary according to location. Signers from the South tend to sign with more flow and ease. Native signers from New York have been reported as signing comparatively quicker and sharper. Sign production of native Californian signers has also been reported as being fast. Research on that phenomenon often concludes that the fast-paced production for signers from the coasts could be due to the fast-paced nature of living in large metropolitan areas. That conclusion also supports how the ease with which Southerners sign could be caused by the easygoing environment of the South in comparison to that of the coasts.

Sign production can also vary depending on age and native language. For example, sign production of letters may vary in older signers. Slight differences in finger spelling production can be a signal of age. Additionally, signers who learned American Sign Language as a second language vary in production. For Deaf signers who learned a different sign language before learning American Sign Language, qualities of their native language may show in their ASL production. Some examples of that varied production include fingerspelling towards the body, instead of away from it, and signing certain movement from bottom to top, instead of top to bottom. Hearing people who learn American Sign Language also have noticeable differences in signing production. The most notable production difference of hearing people learning American Sign Language is their rhythm and arm posture.

=== Sign variants ===
Most popularly, there are variants of the signs for English words such as &quot;birthday&quot;, &quot;pizza&quot;, &quot;Halloween&quot;, &quot;early&quot;, and &quot;soon&quot;, just a sample of the most commonly recognized signs with variants based on regional change. The sign for &quot;school&quot; is commonly varied between black and white signers; the variants used by black signers are sometimes called Black American Sign Language. Social variation is also found between citation forms and forms used by Deaf gay men for words such as &quot;pain&quot; and &quot;protest&quot;.

=== History and implications ===
The prevalence of residential Deaf schools can account for much of the regional variance of signs and sign productions across the United States. Deaf schools often serve students of the state in which the school resides. That limited access to signers from other regions, combined with the residential quality of Deaf Schools promoted specific use of certain sign variants. Native signers did not have much access to signers from other regions during the beginning years of their education. It is hypothesized that because of that seclusion, certain variants of a sign prevailed over others due to the choice of variant used by the student of the school/signers in the community.

However, American Sign Language does not appear to be vastly varied in comparison to other signed languages. That is because when Deaf education was beginning in the United States, many educators flocked to the American School for the Deaf in Hartford, Connecticut, whose central location for the first generation of educators in Deaf education to learn American Sign Language allows ASL to be more standardized than its variant.

== Varieties ==
Varieties of ASL are found throughout the world. There is little difficulty in comprehension among the varieties of the United States and Canada.

Mutual intelligibility among those ASL varieties is high, and the variation is primarily lexical. For example, there are three different words for English &quot;about&quot; in Canadian ASL; the standard way, and two regional variations (Atlantic and Ontario). Variation may also be phonological, meaning that the same sign may be signed in a different way depending on the region. For example, an extremely common type of variation is between the handshapes /1/, /L/, and /5/ in signs with one handshape.

There is also a distinct variety of ASL used by the Black Deaf community. Black ASL evolved as a result of racially segregated schools in some states, which included the residential schools for the deaf. Black ASL differs from standard ASL in vocabulary, phonology, and some grammatical structure. While African American English (AAE) is generally viewed as more innovating than standard English, Black ASL is more conservative than standard ASL, preserving older forms of many signs. Black sign language speakers use more two-handed signs than in mainstream ASL, are less likely to show assimilatory lowering of signs produced on the forehead (e.g. KNOW) and use a wider signing space. Modern Black ASL borrows a number of idioms from AAE; for instance, the AAE idiom &quot;I feel you&quot; is calqued into Black ASL.

ASL is used internationally as a lingua franca, and a number of closely related sign languages derived from ASL are used in many different countries. Even so, there have been varying degrees of divergence from standard ASL in those imported ASL varieties. Bolivian Sign Language is reported to be a dialect of ASL, no more divergent than other acknowledged dialects. On the other hand, it is also known that some imported ASL varieties have diverged to the extent of being separate languages. For example, Malaysian Sign Language, which has ASL origins, is no longer mutually comprehensible with ASL and must be considered its own language. For some imported ASL varieties, such as those used in West Africa, it is still an open question how similar they are to American ASL.

When communicating with hearing English speakers, ASL-speakers often use what is commonly called Pidgin Signed English (PSE) or &#x27;contact signing&#x27;, a blend of English structure with ASL vocabulary. Various types of PSE exist, ranging from highly English-influenced PSE (practically relexified English) to PSE which is quite close to ASL lexically and grammatically, but may alter some subtle features of ASL grammar. Fingerspelling may be used more often in PSE than it is normally used in ASL. There have been some constructed sign languages, known as Manually Coded English (MCE), which match English grammar exactly and simply replace spoken words with signs; those systems are not considered to be varieties of ASL.

Tactile ASL (TASL) is a variety of ASL used throughout the United States by and with the deaf-blind. It is particularly common among those with Usher&#x27;s syndrome. It results in deafness from birth followed by loss of vision later in life; consequently, those with Usher&#x27;s syndrome often grow up in the Deaf community using ASL, and later transition to TASL. TASL differs from ASL in that signs are produced by touching the palms, and there are some grammatical differences from standard ASL in order to compensate for the lack of nonmanual signing.

ASL changes over time and from generation to generation. The sign for telephone has changed as the shape of phones and the manner of holding them have changed. The development of telephones with screens has also changed ASL, encouraging the use of signs that can be seen on small screens.

== Stigma ==
In 2013, the White House published a response to a petition that gained over 37,000 signatures to &quot;officially recognize American Sign Language as a community language and a language of instruction in schools&quot;. The response is titled &quot;there shouldn&#x27;t be any stigma about American Sign Language&quot; and addressed that ASL is a vital language for the Deaf and hard of hearing. Stigmas associated with sign languages and the use of sign for educating children often lead to the absence of sign during periods in children&#x27;s lives when they can access languages most effectively. Scholars such as Beth S. Benedict advocate not only for bilingualism (using ASL and English training) but also for early childhood intervention for children who are deaf. York University psychologist Ellen Bialystok has also campaigned for bilingualism, arguing that those who are bilingual acquire cognitive skills that may help to prevent dementia later in life.

Most children born to deaf parents are hearing. Known as CODAs (&quot;Children of Deaf Adults&quot;), they are often more culturally Deaf than deaf children, most of whom are born to hearing parents. Unlike many deaf children, CODAs acquire ASL as well as Deaf cultural values and behaviors from birth. Such bilingual hearing children may be mistakenly labeled as being &quot;slow learners&quot; or as having &quot;language difficulties&quot; because of preferential attitudes towards spoken language.

== Writing systems ==

Although there is no well-established writing system for ASL, written sign language dates back almost two centuries. The first systematic writing system for a sign language seems to be that of Roch-Ambroise Auguste Bébian, developed in 1825. However, written sign language remained marginal among the public. In the 1960s, linguist William Stokoe created Stokoe notation specifically for ASL. It is alphabetic, with a letter or diacritic for every phonemic (distinctive) hand shape, orientation, motion, and position, though it lacks any representation of facial expression, and is better suited for individual words than for extended passages of text. Stokoe used that system for his 1965 &quot;A Dictionary of American Sign Language on Linguistic Principles&quot;.
SignWriting, proposed in 1974 by Valerie Sutton, is the first writing system to gain use among the public and the first writing system for sign languages to be included in the Unicode Standard. SignWriting consists of more than 5000 distinct iconic graphs/glyphs. Currently, it is in use in many schools for the Deaf, particularly in Brazil, and has been used in International Sign forums with speakers and researchers in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Ethiopia, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia, Tunisia, and the United States. Sutton SignWriting has both a printed and an electronically produced form so that persons can use the system anywhere that oral languages are written (personal letters, newspapers, and media, academic research). The systematic examination of the International Sign Writing Alphabet (ISWA) as an equivalent usage structure to the International Phonetic Alphabet for spoken languages has been proposed. According to some researchers, SignWriting is not a phonemic orthography and does not have a one-to-one map from phonological forms to written forms. That assertion has been disputed, and the process for each country to look at the ISWA and create a phonemic/morphemic assignment of features of each sign language was proposed by researchers Msc. Roberto Cesar Reis da Costa and Madson Barreto in a thesis forum on June 23, 2014. The SignWriting community has an open project on Wikimedia Labs to support the various Wikimedia projects on Wikimedia Incubator and elsewhere involving SignWriting. The ASL Wikipedia request was marked as eligible in 2008 and the test ASL Wikipedia has 50 articles written in ASL using SignWriting.

The most widely used transcription system among academics is HamNoSys, developed at the University of Hamburg. Based on Stokoe Notation, HamNoSys was expanded to about 200 graphs in order to allow transcription of any sign language. Phonological features are usually indicated with single symbols, though the group of features that make up a handshape is indicated collectively with a symbol.

Several additional candidates for written ASL have appeared over the years, including SignFont, ASL-phabet, and Si5s.

For English-speaking audiences, ASL is often glossed using English words. Such glosses are typically all-capitalized and are arranged in ASL order. For example, the ASL sentence &quot;DOG NOW CHASE&gt;IX=3 CAT&quot;, meaning &quot;the dog is chasing the cat&quot;, uses NOW to mark ASL progressive aspect and shows ASL verbal inflection for the third person (&quot;&gt;IX=3&quot;). However, glossing is not used to write the language for speakers of ASL.

== Phonology ==

Each sign in ASL is composed of a number of distinctive components, generally referred to as parameters. A sign may use one hand or both. All signs can be described using the five parameters involved in signed languages, which are handshape, movement, palm orientation, location and nonmanual markers. Just as phonemes of sound distinguish meaning in spoken languages, those parameters are the phonemes that distinguish meaning in signed languages like ASL. Changing any one of them may change the meaning of a sign, as illustrated by the ASL signs THINK and DISAPPOINTED:
There are also meaningful nonmanual signals in ASL, which may include movement of the eyebrows, the cheeks, the nose, the head, the torso, and the eyes.

William Stokoe proposed that such components are analogous to the phonemes of spoken languages. There has also been a proposal that they are analogous to classes like place and manner of articulation. As in spoken languages, those phonological units can be split into distinctive features. For instance, the handshapes /2/ and /3/ are distinguished by the presence or absence of the feature [± closed thumb], as illustrated to the right. ASL has processes of allophony and phonotactic restrictions. There is ongoing research into whether ASL has an analog of syllables in spoken language.

== Grammar ==

=== Morphology ===
ASL has a rich system of verbal inflection, which involves both grammatical aspect: how the action of verbs flows in time—and agreement marking. Aspect can be marked by changing the manner of movement of the verb; for example, continuous aspect is marked by incorporating rhythmic, circular movement, while punctual aspect is achieved by modifying the sign so that it has a stationary hand position. Verbs may agree with both the subject and the object, and are marked for number and reciprocity. Reciprocity is indicated by using two one-handed signs; for example, the sign SHOOT, made with an L-shaped handshape with inward movement of the thumb, inflects to SHOOT[reciprocal], articulated by having two L-shaped hands &quot;shooting&quot; at each other.

ASL has a productive system of classifiers, which are used to classify objects and their movement in space. For example, a rabbit running downhill would use a classifier consisting of a bent V classifier handshape with a downhill-directed path; if the rabbit is hopping, the path is executed with a bouncy manner. In general, classifiers are composed of a &quot;classifier handshape&quot; bound to a &quot;movement root&quot;. The classifier handshape represents the object as a whole, incorporating such attributes as surface, depth, and shape, and is usually very iconic. The movement root consists of a path, a direction and a manner.

In linguistics, there are two primary ways of changing the form of a word: derivation and inflection. Derivation involves creating new words by adding something to an existing word, while inflection involves changing the form of a word to convey grammatical information without altering its fundamental meaning or category.

For example, adding the suffix &quot;-ship&quot; to the noun &quot;friend&quot; creates the new word &quot;friendship&quot;, which has a different meaning than the original word. Inflection, on the other hand, involves modifying a word&#x27;s form to indicate grammatical features such as tense, number, gender, person, case, and degree of comparison.

In American Sign Language (ASL), inflection is conveyed through facial expressions, body movements, and other non-manual markers. For instance, to indicate past tense in ASL, one might sign the present tense of a verb (such as &quot;walk&quot;), and then add a facial expression and head tilt to signify that the action occurred in the past (i.e., &quot;walked&quot;).

According to the book Linguistics of American Sign Language, ASL signs have two main components: hold segments and movement segments. Hold segments consist of hand-shape, location, orientation, and non-manual features, while movement segments possess similar features.

Morphology is the study of how languages form words by using smaller units to construct larger units. The smallest meaningful unit in a language is known as a &quot;morpheme&quot;, with some morphemes able to stand alone as independent units (free morphemes), while others must occur with other morphemes (bound morphemes).

For example, the plural &quot;-s&quot; and third person &quot;-s&quot; in English are bound morphemes. In ASL, the 3 handshape in signs like THREE-WEEKS and THREE-MONTHS are also bound morphemes.

Affixes, which are morphemes added to words to create new words or modify their meanings, are part of the derivational process. For example, in English, prefixes like &quot;re-&quot; and suffixes like &quot;-able&quot; are affixes. In ASL, affixation can be used to modify the sign for CHAIR to indicate different types of chairs. The inflectional process, on the other hand, adds grammatical information to existing units.

By studying morphemes and how they can be combined or modified, linguists gain insight into the underlying structure of language and the creative ways in which it can be used to express meaning. Understanding morphology is essential to understanding how languages are built and how new signs or words can be formed.

Furthermore, understanding morphology has practical applications in language learning and teaching. For example, teaching students the basic morphological structures of a language can help them to better understand the language&#x27;s grammar and syntax, and can also aid in their acquisition of new vocabulary.

In summary, morphology is an essential component of language and provides valuable insights into the structure and function of languages. By understanding the morphological processes involved in language formation, we can gain a deeper understanding of how languages work and how they can be effectively taught and learned.

==== Fingerspelling ====
American Sign Language possesses a set of 26 signs known as the American manual alphabet, which can be used to spell out words from the English language. It is rather a representation of the English alphabet, and not a unique alphabet of ASL, although commonly labeled as the &quot;ASL alphabet&quot;. It is borrowed from French Sign Language (LSF), as much of ASL is derived from LSF. Such signs make use of the 19 handshapes of ASL. For example, the signs for &#x27;p&#x27; and &#x27;k&#x27; use the same handshape but different orientations. A common misconception is that ASL consists only of fingerspelling; although such a method (Rochester Method) has been used, it is not ASL.

Fingerspelling is a form of borrowing, a linguistic process wherein words from one language are incorporated into another. In ASL, fingerspelling is used for proper nouns and for technical terms with no native ASL equivalent. There are also some other loan words which are fingerspelled, either very short English words or abbreviations of longer English words, e.g. &quot;O-N&quot; from English &#x27;on&#x27;, and &quot;A-P-T&quot; from English &#x27;apartment&#x27;. Fingerspelling may also be used to emphasize a word that would normally be signed otherwise.

=== Syntax ===
ASL is a subject–verb–object (SVO) language, but various phenomena affect that basic word order. Basic SVO sentences are signed without any pauses:

However, other word orders may also occur since ASL allows the topic of a sentence to be moved to sentence-initial position, a phenomenon known as topicalization. In object–subject–verb (OSV) sentences, the object is topicalized, marked by a forward head-tilt and a pause:

Besides, word orders can be obtained through the phenomenon of subject copy in which the subject is repeated at the end of the sentence, accompanied by head nodding for clarification or emphasis:

ASL also allows null subject sentences whose subject is implied, rather than stated explicitly. Subjects can be copied even in a null subject sentence, and the subject is then omitted from its original position, yielding a verb–object–subject (VOS) construction:

Topicalization, accompanied with a null subject and a subject copy, can produce yet another word order, object–verb–subject (OVS).

Those properties of ASL allow it a variety of word orders, leading many to question which is the true, underlying, &quot;basic&quot; order. There are several other proposals that attempt to account for the flexibility of word order in ASL. One proposal is that languages like ASL are best described with a topic–comment structure whose words are ordered by their importance in the sentence, rather than by their syntactic properties. Another hypothesis is that ASL exhibits free word order, in which syntax is not encoded in word order but can be encoded by other means such as head nods, eyebrow movement, and body position.

== Iconicity ==
Common misconceptions are that signs are iconically self-explanatory, that they are a transparent imitation of what they mean, or even that they are pantomime. In fact, many signs bear no resemblance to their referent because they were originally arbitrary symbols, or their iconicity has been obscured over time. Even so, in ASL iconicity plays a significant role; a high percentage of signs resemble their referents in some way. That may be because the medium of sign, three-dimensional space, naturally allows more iconicity than oral language.

In the era of the influential linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, it was assumed that the mapping between form and meaning in language must be completely arbitrary. Although onomatopoeia is a clear exception, since words like &quot;choo-choo&quot; bear clear resemblance to the sounds that they mimic, the Saussurean approach was to treat them as marginal exceptions. ASL, with its significant inventory of iconic signs, directly challenges that theory.

Research on acquisition of pronouns in ASL has shown that children do not always take advantage of the iconic properties of signs when they interpret their meaning. It has been found that when children acquire the pronoun &quot;you&quot;, the iconicity of the point (at the child) is often confused, being treated more like a name. That is a similar finding to research in oral languages on pronoun acquisition. It has also been found that iconicity of signs does not affect immediate memory and recall; less iconic signs are remembered just as well as highly-iconic signs.

<text>In computing, an applet is any small application that performs one specific task that runs within the scope of a dedicated widget engine or a larger program, often as a plug-in. The term is frequently used to refer to a Java applet, a program written in the Java programming language that is designed to be placed on a web page. Applets are typical examples of transient and auxiliary applications that do not monopolize the user&#x27;s attention. Applets are not full-featured application programs, and are intended to be easily accessible.

==History==
The word &quot;applet&quot; was first used in 1990 in &quot;PC Magazine&quot;. However, the concept of an applet, or more broadly a small interpreted program downloaded and executed by the user, dates at least to RFC 5 (1969) by Jeff Rulifson, which described the Decode-Encode Language, which was designed to allow remote use of the oN-Line System over ARPANET, by downloading small programs to enhance the interaction. This has been specifically credited as a forerunner of Java&#x27;s downloadable programs in RFC 2555.

==Applet as an extension of other software==
In some cases, an applet does not run independently. These applets must run either in a container provided by a host program, through a plugin, or a variety of other applications including mobile devices that support the applet programming model.

===Web-based applets===
Applets were used to provide interactive features to web applications that historically could not be provided by HTML alone. They could capture mouse input and also had controls like buttons or check boxes. In response to the user action, an applet could change the provided graphic content. This made applets well suited for demonstration, visualization, and teaching. There were online applet collections for studying various subjects, from physics to heart physiology. Applets were also used to create online game collections that allowed players to compete against live opponents in real-time.

An applet could also be a text area only, providing, for instance, a cross-platform command-line interface to some remote system. If needed, an applet could leave the dedicated area and run as a separate window. However, applets had very little control over web page content outside the applet dedicated area, so they were less useful for improving the site appearance in general (while applets like news tickers or WYSIWYG editors are also known). Applets could also play media in formats that are not natively supported by the browser.

HTML pages could embed parameters that were passed to the applet. Hence, the same applet could appear differently depending on the parameters that were passed.

Examples of Web-based applets include:

* QuickTime movies
* Flash movies
* Windows Media Player applets, used to display embedded video files in Internet Explorer (and other browsers that supported the plugin)
* 3D modeling display applets, used to rotate and zoom a model
* Browser games that were applet-based, though some developed into fully functional applications that required installation.

===Applet Vs. Subroutine===
A larger application distinguishes its applets through several features:

* Applets execute only on the &quot;client&quot; platform environment of a system, as contrasted from &quot;Servlet&quot;. As such, an applet provides functionality or performance beyond the default capabilities of its container (the browser).
* The container restricts applets&#x27; capabilities.
* Applets are written in a language different from the scripting or HTML language that invokes it. The applet is written in a compiled language, whereas the scripting language of the container is an interpreted language, hence the greater performance or functionality of the applet. Unlike a subroutine, a complete web component can be implemented as an applet.

==Java applets==
A Java applet is a Java program that is launched from HTML and run in a web browser. It takes code from server and run in a web browser. It can provide web applications with interactive features that cannot be provided by HTML. Since Java&#x27;s bytecode is platform-independent, Java applets can be executed by browsers running under many platforms, including Windows, Unix, macOS, and Linux. When a Java technology-enabled web browser processes a page that contains an applet, the applet&#x27;s code is transferred to the client&#x27;s system and executed by the browser&#x27;s Java virtual machine. An HTML page references an applet either via the deprecated tag or via its replacement, the tag.

==Security==
Recent developments in the coding of applications, including mobile and embedded systems, have led to the awareness of the security of applets.

===Open platform applets===
Applets in an open platform environment should provide secure interactions between different applications. A compositional approach can be used to provide security for open platform applets. Advanced compositional verification methods have been developed for secure applet interactions.

===Java applets===
A Java applet contains different security models: unsigned Java applet security, signed Java applet security, and self-signed Java applet security.

===Web-based applets===
In an applet-enabled web browser, many methods can be used to provide applet security for malicious applets. A malicious applet can infect a computer system in many ways, including denial of service, invasion of privacy, and annoyance. A typical solution for malicious applets is to make the web browser to monitor applets&#x27; activities. This will result in a web browser that will enable the manual or automatic stopping of malicious applets.
