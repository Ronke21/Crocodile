<text>Andrei Dmitrievich Sakharov (; 21 May 192114 December 1989) was a Soviet physicist and a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, which he was awarded in 1975 for emphasizing human rights around the world.

Although he spent his career in physics in the Soviet program of nuclear weapons, overseeing the development of thermonuclear weapons, Sakharov also did fundamental work in understanding particle physics, magnetism, and physical cosmology. Sakharov is mostly known for his political activism for individual freedom, human rights, civil liberties and reforms in the Soviet Union, for which he was deemed a dissident and faced persecution from the Soviet establishment.

In his memory, the Sakharov Prize was established and is awarded annually by the European Parliament for people and organizations dedicated to human rights and freedoms.

== Biography ==
=== Family background and early life ===

Andrei Dmitrievich Sakharov was born in Moscow on 21 May 1921, to a Russian family. His father, Dmitri Ivanovich Sakharov, was a physics professor at the Second Moscow State University and an amateur pianist. His grandfather, Ivan, was a lawyer in the former Russian Empire who had displayed respect for social awareness and humanitarian principles (including advocating the abolition of capital punishment). Sakharov&#x27;s mother, Yekaterina Alekseevna Sofiano, was a daughter of Aleksey Semenovich Sofiano, a general in the Tsarist Russian Army with Greek heritage.

Sakharov&#x27;s parents and paternal grandmother, Maria Petrovna, largely shaped his personality; his mother and grandmother were members of the Russian Orthodox Church, although his father was a non-believer. When Andrei was about thirteen, he realized that he did not believe in God. However, despite being an atheist, he did believe in a &quot;guiding principle&quot; that transcends the physical laws.

After schooling, Sakharov studied physics at the Moscow State University in 1938 and, following evacuation in 1941 during the Eastern Front with Germany, he graduated in Aşgabat in Turkmenistan. In 1943, he married Klavdia Alekseyevna Vikhireva, with whom he raised two daughters and a son. Klavdia would later die in 1969. In 1945, he joined the Theoretical Department of Physical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences under Igor Tamm in Moscow. In 1947, Sakharov was successful in defending his thesis for the Doctor of Sciences (lit. &quot;Doktor Nauk&quot;), which covered the topic of nuclear transmutation.

===Soviet program of nuclear weapons===

After World War II, he researched cosmic rays. In mid-1948 he participated in the Soviet atomic bomb project under Igor Kurchatov and Igor Tamm. Sakharov&#x27;s study group at FIAN in 1948 came up with a second concept in August–September 1948. Adding a shell of natural, unenriched uranium around the deuterium would increase the deuterium concentration at the uranium-deuterium boundary and the overall yield of the device, because the natural uranium would capture neutrons and itself fission as part of the thermonuclear reaction. This idea of a layered fission-fusion-fission bomb led Sakharov to call it the &quot;sloika&quot;, or layered cake. The first Soviet atomic device was tested on August 29, 1949. After moving to Sarov in 1950, Sakharov played a key role in the development of the first megaton-range Soviet hydrogen bomb using a design known as &quot;Sakharov&#x27;s Third Idea&quot; in Russia and the Teller–Ulam design in the United States. Before his &quot;Third Idea&quot;, Sakharov tried a &quot;layer cake&quot; of alternating layers of fission and fusion fuel. The results were disappointing, yielding no more than a typical fission bomb. However the design was seen to be worth pursuing because deuterium is abundant and uranium is scarce, and he had no idea how powerful the US design was. Sakharov realised that in order to cause the explosion of one side of the fuel to symmetrically compress the fusion fuel, a mirror could be used to reflect the radiation. The details had not been officially declassified in Russia when Sakharov was writing his memoirs, but in the Teller–Ulam design, soft X-rays emitted by the fission bomb were focused onto a cylinder of lithium deuteride to compress it symmetrically. This is called radiation implosion. The Teller–Ulam design also had a secondary fission device inside the fusion cylinder to assist with the compression of the fusion fuel and generate neutrons to convert some of the lithium to tritium, producing a mixture of deuterium and tritium. Sakharov&#x27;s idea was first tested as RDS-37 in 1955. A larger variation of the same design which Sakharov worked on was the 50 Mt Tsar Bomba of October 1961, which was the most powerful nuclear device ever detonated.

Sakharov saw &quot;striking parallels&quot; between his fate and those of J. Robert Oppenheimer and Edward Teller in the US. Sakharov believed that in this &quot;tragic confrontation of two outstanding people&quot;, both deserved respect, because &quot;each of them was certain he had right on his side and was morally obligated to go to the end in the name of truth.&quot; While Sakharov strongly disagreed with Teller over nuclear testing in the atmosphere and the Strategic Defense Initiative, he believed that American academics had been unfair to Teller&#x27;s resolve to get the H-bomb for the United States since &quot;all steps by the Americans of a temporary or permanent rejection of developing thermonuclear weapons would have been seen either as a clever feint, or as the manifestation of stupidity. In both cases, the reaction would have been the same – avoid the trap and immediately take advantage of the enemy&#x27;s stupidity.&quot;

Sakharov never felt that by creating nuclear weapons he had &quot;known sin&quot;, in Oppenheimer&#x27;s expression. He later wrote:
===Support for peaceful use of nuclear technology===

In 1950 he proposed an idea for a controlled nuclear fusion reactor, the tokamak, which is still the basis for the majority of work in the area. Sakharov, in association with Tamm, proposed confining extremely hot ionized plasma by torus shaped magnetic fields for controlling thermonuclear fusion that led to the development of the tokamak device.

===Magneto-implosive generators===

In 1951 he invented and tested the first explosively pumped flux compression generators, compressing magnetic fields by explosives. He called these devices MK (for &quot;MagnetoKumulative&quot;) generators. The radial MK-1 produced a pulsed magnetic field of 25 megagauss (2500 teslas). The resulting helical MK-2 generated 1000 million amperes in 1953.

Sakharov then tested a MK-driven &quot;plasma cannon&quot; where a small aluminum ring was vaporized by huge eddy currents into a stable, self-confined toroidal plasmoid and was accelerated to 100 km/s. Sakharov later suggested replacing the copper coil in MK generators with a large superconductor solenoid to magnetically compress and focus underground nuclear explosions into a shaped charge effect. He theorized this could focus 1023 protons per second on a 1 mm2 surface.

===Particle physics and cosmology===
After 1965 Sakharov returned to fundamental science and began working on particle physics and physical cosmology.

He tried to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe; in that regard, he was the first to give a theoretical motivation for proton decay. Proton decay was suggested by Wigner in 1949 and 1952.
Proton decay experiments had been performed since 1954 already. Sakharov was the first to consider CPT-symmetric events occurring &quot;before&quot; the Big Bang:We can visualize that neutral spinless maximons (or photons) are produced at &quot;t&quot; &lt; 0 from contracting matter having an excess of antiquarks, that they pass &quot;one through the other&quot; at the instant &quot;t&quot; = 0 when the density is infinite, and decay with an excess of quarks when &quot;t&quot; &gt; 0, realizing total CPT symmetry of the universe. All the phenomena at t &lt; 0 are assumed in this hypothesis to be CPT reflections of the phenomena at t &gt; 0. His legacy in this domain are the famous conditions named after him: Baryon number violation, C-symmetry and CP-symmetry violation, and interactions out of thermal equilibrium.

Sakharov was also interested in explaining why the curvature of the universe is so small. This led him to consider cyclic models, where the universe oscillates between contraction and expansion phases. In those models, after a certain number of cycles the curvature naturally becomes infinite even if it had not started this way: Sakharov considered three starting points, a flat universe with a slightly negative cosmological constant, a universe with a positive curvature and a zero cosmological constant, and a universe with a negative curvature and a slightly negative cosmological constant. Those last two models feature what Sakharov calls a reversal of the time arrow, which can be summarized as follows: He considers times t &gt; 0 after the initial Big Bang singularity at t = 0 (which he calls &quot;Friedman singularity&quot; and denotes Φ) as well as times t &lt; 0 before that singularity. He then assumes that entropy increases when time increases for t &gt; 0 as well as when time decreases for t &lt; 0, which constitutes his reversal of time. Then he considers the case when the universe at t &lt; 0 is the image of the universe at t &gt; 0 under CPT symmetry but also the case when it is not so: the universe has a non-zero CPT charge at t = 0 in this case. Sakharov considers a variant of this model where the reversal of the time arrow occurs at a point of maximum entropy instead of happening at the singularity. In those models there is no dynamic interaction between the universe at t &lt; 0 and t &gt; 0.

In his first model the two universes did not interact, except via local matter accumulation whose density and pressure become high enough to connect the two sheets through a bridge without spacetime between them, but with a continuity of geodesics beyond the Schwarzschild radius with no singularity, allowing an exchange of matter between the two conjugated sheets, based on an idea after Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov. Novikov called such singularities a &quot;collapse&quot; and an &quot;anticollapse&quot;, which are an alternative to the couple black hole and white hole in the wormhole model. Sakharov also proposed the idea of induced gravity as an alternative theory of quantum gravity.

===Turn to activism===

Since the late 1950s Sakharov had become concerned about the moral and political implications of his work. Politically active during the 1960s, Sakharov was against nuclear proliferation. Pushing for the end of atmospheric tests, he played a role in the 1963 Partial Test Ban Treaty, signed in Moscow.

Sakharov was also involved in an event with political consequences in 1964, when the Soviet Academy of Sciences nominated for full membership Nikolai Nuzhdin, a follower of Trofim Lysenko (initiator of the Stalin-supported anti-genetics campaign Lysenkoism). Contrary to normal practice, Sakharov, a member of the academy, publicly spoke out against full membership for Nuzhdin and held him responsible for &quot;the defamation, firing, arrest, even death, of many genuine scientists.&quot; In the end, Nuzhdin was not elected, but the episode prompted Nikita Khrushchev to order the KGB to gather compromising material on Sakharov.

The major turn in Sakharov&#x27;s political evolution came in 1967, when anti-ballistic missile defense became a key issue in US–Soviet relations. In a secret detailed letter to the Soviet leadership of July 21, 1967, Sakharov explained the need to &quot;take the Americans at their word&quot; and accept their proposal for a &quot;bilateral rejection by the USA and the Soviet Union of the development of antiballistic missile defense&quot; because an arms race in the new technology would otherwise increase the likelihood of nuclear war. He also asked permission to publish his manuscript, which accompanied the letter, in a newspaper to explain the dangers posed by that kind of defense. The government ignored his letter and refused to let him initiate a public discussion of ABMs in the Soviet press.

Since 1967, after the Six Day War and the beginning of the Arab-Israeli conflict, he actively supported Israel, as he reported more than once in the press, and also maintained friendly relations with refuseniks who later made aliyah.

In May 1968, Sakharov completed an essay, &quot;Reflections on Progress, Peaceful Coexistence, and Intellectual Freedom&quot;. He described the anti-ballistic missile defense as a major threat of world nuclear war. After the essay was circulated in &quot;samizdat&quot; and then published outside the Soviet Union, Sakharov was banned from conducting any military-related research and returned to FIAN to study fundamental theoretical physics.

For 12 years, until his exile to Gorky (Nizhny Novgorod) in January 1980, Sakharov assumed the role of a widely recognized and open dissident in Moscow. He stood vigil outside closed courtrooms, wrote appeals on behalf of more than 200 individual prisoners, and continued to write essays about the need for democratization.

In 1970, Sakharov was among the three founding members of the Committee on Human Rights in the USSR, along with Valery Chalidze and Andrei Tverdokhlebov. The Committee wrote appeals, collected signatures for petitions and succeeded in affiliating with several international human rights organizations. Its work was the subject of many KGB reports and brought Sakharov under increasing pressure from the government.

Sakharov married a fellow human rights activist, Yelena Bonner, in 1972.

By 1973, Sakharov was meeting regularly with Western correspondents and holding press conferences in his apartment. He appealed to the US Congress to approve the 1974 Jackson-Vanik Amendment to a trade bill, which coupled trade tariffs to the Kremlin&#x27;s willingness to allow freer emigration for Soviet Jews.

===Attacked by Soviet establishment from 1972===
In 1972, Sakharov became the target of sustained pressure from his fellow scientists in the Soviet Academy of Sciences and the Soviet press. The writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn came to his defence.

In 1973 and 1974, the Soviet media campaign continued, targeting both Sakharov and Solzhenitsyn for their pro-Western, anti-socialist positions.

Sakharov later described that it took &quot;years&quot; for him to &quot;understand how much substitution, deceit, and lack of correspondence with reality there was&quot; in the Soviet ideals. &quot;At first I thought, despite everything that I saw with my own eyes, that the Soviet State was a breakthrough into the future, a kind of prototype for all countries&quot;. Then he came, in his words, to &quot;the theory of symmetry: all governments and regimes to a first approximation are bad, all peoples are oppressed, and all are threatened by common dangers.&quot;:

Sakharov&#x27;s ideas on social development led him to put forward the principle of human rights as a new basis of all politics. In his works, he declared that &quot;the principle &#x27;what is not prohibited is allowed&#x27; should be understood literally&quot;, and defied what he saw as unwritten ideological rules imposed by the Communist Party on the society in spite of a democratic Soviet Constitution (1936):


In a letter written from exile, he cheered up a fellow physicist and free market advocate with the words: &quot;Fortunately, the future is unpredictable and also – because of quantum effects – uncertain.&quot; For Sakharov, the indeterminacy of the future supported his belief that he could and should take personal responsibility for it.

=== Nobel Peace Prize (1975) ===
In 1973, Sakharov was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, and in 1974, he was awarded the Prix mondial Cino Del Duca.

Sakharov was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975. The Norwegian Nobel Committee called him &quot;a spokesman for the conscience of mankind&quot;. In the words of the Nobel Committee&#x27;s citation: &quot;In a convincing manner Sakharov has emphasised that Man&#x27;s inviolable rights provide the only safe foundation for genuine and enduring international cooperation.&quot;

Sakharov was not allowed to leave the Soviet Union to collect the prize. His wife, Yelena Bonner, read his speech at the ceremony in Oslo, Norway. On the day the prize was awarded, Sakharov was in Vilnius, where the human rights activist Sergei Kovalev was being tried. In his Nobel lecture, &quot;Peace, Progress, Human Rights&quot;, Sakharov called for an end to the arms race, greater respect for the environment, international cooperation, and universal respect for human rights. He included a list of prisoners of conscience and political prisoners in the Soviet Union and stated that he shared the prize with them.

By 1976, the head of the KGB, Yuri Andropov, was prepared to call Sakharov &quot;Domestic Enemy Number One&quot; before a group of KGB officers.

===Internal exile (1980–1986)===

Sakharov was arrested on 22 January 1980, following his public protests against the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan in 1979, and was sent to the city of Gorky, now Nizhny Novgorod, a city that was off limits to foreigners.

Between 1980 and 1986, Sakharov was kept under Soviet police surveillance. In his memoirs, he mentioned that their apartment in Gorky was repeatedly subjected to searches and heists. Sakharov was named the 1980 Humanist of the Year by the American Humanist Association.

In May 1984, Sakharov&#x27;s wife, Yelena Bonner, was detained, and Sakharov began a hunger strike, demanding permission for his wife to travel to the United States for heart surgery. He was forcibly hospitalized and force-fed. He was held in isolation for four months. In August 1984, Bonner was sentenced by a court to five years of exile in Gorky.

In April 1985, Sakharov started a new hunger strike for his wife to travel abroad for medical treatment. He again was taken to a hospital and force-fed. In August, the Politburo discussed what to do about Sakharov. He remained in the hospital until October 1985, when his wife was allowed to travel to the United States. She had heart surgery in the United States and returned to Gorky in June 1986.

In December 1985, the European Parliament established the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, to be given annually for outstanding contributions to human rights.

On 19 December 1986, Mikhail Gorbachev, who had initiated the policies of perestroika and glasnost, called Sakharov to tell him that he and his wife could return to Moscow.

===Political leader===

In 1988, Sakharov was given the International Humanist Award by the International Humanist and Ethical Union. He helped to initiate the first independent legal political organizations and became prominent in the Soviet Union&#x27;s growing political opposition. In March 1989, Sakharov was elected to the new parliament, the All-Union Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies and co-led the democratic opposition, the Inter-Regional Deputies Group. In November the head of the KGB reported to Gorbachev on Sakharov&#x27;s encouragement and support for the coal miners&#x27; strike in Vorkuta.

In December 1988, Sakharov visited Armenia and Azerbaijan on a fact-finding mission. He concluded, &quot;For Azerbaijan the issue of Karabakh is a matter of ambition, for the Armenians of Karabakh, it is a matter of life and death&quot;.

===Death===

Soon after 9 p.m. on 14 December 1989, Sakharov went to his study to take a nap before preparing an important speech he was to deliver the next day in the Congress. His wife went to wake him at 11 p.m. as he had requested but she found Sakharov dead on the floor. According to the notes of Yakov Rapoport, a senior pathologist present at the autopsy, it is most likely that Sakharov died of an arrhythmia consequent to dilated cardiomyopathy at the age of 68. He was interred in the Vostryakovskoye Cemetery in Moscow.

=== Memorial prizes ===
The Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought was established in 1988 by the European Parliament in his honour, and is the highest tribute to human rights endeavours awarded by the European Union. It is awarded annually by the parliament to &quot;those who carry the spirit of Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov&quot;; to &quot;Laureates who, like Sakharov, dedicate their lives to peaceful struggle for human rights.&quot;

An Andrei Sakharov prize has also been awarded by the American Physical Society every second year since 2006 &quot;to recognize outstanding leadership and/or achievements of scientists in upholding human rights&quot;.

The Andrei Sakharov Prize for Writer&#x27;s Civic Courage was established in October 1990.

In 2004, with the approval of Yelena Bonner, an annual Sakharov Prize for journalism was established for reporters and commentators in Russia. Funded by former Soviet dissident Pyotr Vins, now a businessman in the US, the prize is administered by the Glasnost Defence Foundation in Moscow. The prize &quot;for journalism as an act of conscience&quot; has been won over the years by famous journalists such as Anna Politkovskaya and young reporters and editors working far from Russia&#x27;s media capital, Moscow. The 2015 winner was Yelena Kostyuchenko.

=== Andrei Sakharov Archives and Human Rights Center ===
The Andrei Sakharov Archives and Human Rights Center, established at Brandeis University in 1993, are now housed at Harvard University.
The documents from that archive were published by the Yale University Press in 2005. These documents are available online.

Most of documents of the archive are letters from the head of the KGB to the Central Committee about activities of Soviet dissidents and recommendations about the interpretation in newspapers. The letters cover the period from 1968 to 1991 (Brezhnev stagnation). The documents characterize not only Sakharov&#x27;s activity, but that of other dissidents, as well as that of highest-position apparatchiks and the KGB. No Russian equivalent of the KGB archive is available.

<text>Astrobiology (also xenology or exobiology) is a scientific field within the life and environmental sciences that studies the origins, early evolution, distribution, and future of life in the universe by investigating its deterministic conditions and contingent events. As a discipline, astrobiology is founded on the premise that life may exist beyond Earth.

Research in astrobiology comprises three main areas: the study of habitable environments in the Solar System and beyond, the search for planetary biosignatures of past or present extraterrestrial life, and the study of the origin and early evolution of life on Earth.

The field of astrobiology has its origins in the 20th century with the advent of space exploration and the discovery of exoplanets. Early astrobiology research focused on the search for extraterrestrial life and the study of the potential for life to exist on other planets. In the 1960s and 1970s, NASA began its astrobiology pursuits within the Viking program, which was the first US mission to land on Mars and search for signs of life. This mission, along with other early space exploration missions, laid the foundation for the development of astrobiology as a discipline.

Regarding habitable environments, astrobiology investigates potential locations beyond Earth that could support life, such as Mars, Europa, and exoplanets, through research into the extremophiles populating austere environments on Earth, like volcanic and deep sea environments. Research within this topic is conducted utilising the methodology of the geosciences, especially geobiology, for astrobiological applications.

The search for biosignatures involves the identification of signs of past or present life in the form of organic compounds, isotopic ratios, or microbial fossils. Research within this topic is conducted utilising the methodology of planetary and environmental science, especially atmospheric science, for astrobiological applications, and is often conducted through remote sensing and in situ missions.

Astrobiology also concerns the study of the origin and early evolution of life on Earth to try to understand the conditions that are necessary for life to form on other planets. This research seeks to understand how life emerged from non-living matter and how it evolved to become the diverse array of organisms we see today. Research within this topic is conducted utilising the methodology of paleosciences, especially paleobiology, for astrobiological applications.

Astrobiology is a rapidly developing field with a strong interdisciplinary aspect that holds many challenges and opportunities for scientists. Astrobiology programs and research centres are present in many universities and research institutions around the world, and space agencies like NASA and ESA have dedicated departments and programs for astrobiology research.

== Overview ==

The term astrobiology was first proposed by the Russian astronomer Gavriil Tikhov in 1953. It is etymologically derived from the Greek , &quot;star&quot;; , &quot;life&quot;; and , &quot;&quot;, &quot;study&quot;. A close synonym is exobiology from the Greek Έξω, &quot;external&quot;; , &quot;life&quot;; and , &quot;&quot;, &quot;study&quot;, coined by American molecular biologist Joshua Lederberg; exobiology is considered to have a narrow scope limited to search of life external to Earth. Another associated term is xenobiology, from the Greek ξένος, &quot;foreign&quot;; , &quot;life&quot;; and -λογία, &quot;study&quot;, coined by American science fiction writer Robert Heinlein in his work &quot;The Star Beast&quot;; xenobiology is now used in a more specialised sense, referring to &#x27;biology based on foreign chemistry&#x27;, whether of extraterrestrial or terrestrial (typically synthetic) origin.

While the potential for extraterrestrial life, especially intelligent life, has been explored throughout human history within philosophy and narrative, the question is a verifiable hypothesis and thus a valid line of scientific inquiry; planetary scientist David Grinspoon calls it a field of natural philosophy, grounding speculation on the unknown in known scientific theory.

The modern field of astrobiology can be traced back to the 1950s and 1960s with the advent of space exploration, when scientists began to seriously consider the possibility of life on other planets. In 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite, which marked the beginning of the Space Age. This event led to an increase in the study of the potential for life on other planets, as scientists began to consider the possibilities opened up by the new technology of space exploration. In 1959, NASA funded its first exobiology project, and in 1960, NASA founded the Exobiology Program, now one of four main elements of NASA&#x27;s current Astrobiology Program. In 1971, NASA funded Project Cyclops, part of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, to search radio frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum for interstellar communications transmitted by extraterrestrial life outside the Solar System. In the 1960s-1970s, NASA established the Viking program, which was the first US mission to land on Mars and search for metabolic signs of present life; the results were inconclusive.

In the 1980s and 1990s, the field began to expand and diversify as new discoveries and technologies emerged. The discovery of microbial life in extreme environments on Earth, such as deep-sea hydrothermal vents, helped to clarify the feasibility of potential life existing in harsh conditions. The development of new techniques for the detection of biosignatures, such as the use of stable isotopes, also played a significant role in the evolution of the field.

The contemporary landscape of astrobiology emerged in the early 21st century, focused on utilising Earth and environmental science for applications within comparate space environments. Missions included the ESA&#x27;s Beagle 2, which failed minutes after landing on Mars, NASA&#x27;s &quot;Phoenix&quot; lander, which probed the environment for past and present planetary habitability of microbial life on Mars and researched the history of water, and NASA&#x27;s &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover, currently probing the environment for past and present planetary habitability of microbial life on Mars.

==Theoretical foundations==
=== Planetary habitability ===
Astrobiological research makes a number of simplifying assumptions when studying the necessary components for planetary habitability.

Carbon and Organic Compounds: Carbon is the fourth most abundant element in the universe and the energy required to make or break a bond is at just the appropriate level for building molecules which are not only stable, but also reactive. The fact that carbon atoms bond readily to other carbon atoms allows for the building of extremely long and complex molecules. As such, astrobiological research presumes that the vast majority of life forms in the Milky Way galaxy are based on carbon chemistries, as are all life forms on Earth. However, theoretical astrobiology entertains the potential for other organic molecular bases for life, thus astrobiological research often focuses on identifying environments that have the potential to support life based on the presence of organic compounds.

Liquid water: Liquid water is a common molecule that provides an excellent environment for the formation of complicated carbon-based molecules, and is generally considered necessary for life as we know it to exist. Thus, astrobiological research presumes that extraterrestrial life similarly depends upon access to liquid water, and often focuses on identifying environments that have the potential to support liquid water. Some researchers posit environments of water-ammonia mixtures as possible solvents for hypothetical types of biochemistry.

Environmental stability: Where organisms adaptively evolve to the conditions of the environments in which they reside, environmental stability is considered necessary for life to exist. This presupposes the necessity of a stable temperature, pressure, and radiation levels; resultantly, astrobiological research focuses on planets orbiting Sun-like red dwarf stars. This is because very large stars have relatively short lifetimes, meaning that life might not have time to emerge on planets orbiting them; very small stars provide so little heat and warmth that only planets in very close orbits around them would not be frozen solid, and in such close orbits these planets would be tidally locked to the star; whereas the long lifetimes of red dwarfs could allow the development of habitable environments on planets with thick atmospheres. This is significant as red dwarfs are extremely common. (&quot;See also&quot;: Habitability of red dwarf systems).

Energy source: It is assumed that any life elsewhere in the universe would also require an energy source. Previously, it was assumed that this would necessarily be from a sun-like star, however with developments within extremophile research contemporary astrobiological research often focuses on identifying environments that have the potential to support life based on the availability of an energy source, such as the presence of volcanic activity on a planet or moon that could provide a source of heat and energy.

It is important to note that these assumptions are based on our current understanding of life on Earth and the conditions under which it can exist. As our understanding of life and the potential for it to exist in different environments evolves, these assumptions may change.

==Methods==
===Studying terrestrial extremophiles===
Astrobiological research concerning the study of habitable environments in our solar system and beyond utilises methods within the geosciences. Research within this branch primarily concerns the geobiology of organisms that can survive in extreme environments on Earth, such as in volcanic or deep sea environments, to understand the limits of life, and the conditions under which life might be able to survive on other planets. This includes, but is not limited to:

Deep-sea extremophiles: Researchers are studying organisms that live in the extreme environments of deep-sea hydrothermal vents and cold seeps. These organisms survive in the absence of sunlight, and some are able to survive in high temperatures and pressures, and use chemical energy instead of sunlight to produce food.

Desert extremophiles: Researchers are studying organisms that can survive in extreme dry, high temperature conditions, such as in deserts.

Microbes in extreme environments: Researchers are investigating the diversity and activity of microorganisms in environments such as deep mines, subsurface soil, cold glaciers and polar ice, and high-altitude environments.

===Researching Earth&#x27;s present environment===
Research also regards the long-term survival of life on Earth, and the possibilities and hazards of life on other planets, including:

Biodiversity and ecosystem resilience: Scientists are studying how the diversity of life and the interactions between different species contribute to the resilience of ecosystems and their ability to recover from disturbances.

Climate change and extinction: Researchers are investigating the impacts of climate change on different species and ecosystems, and how they may lead to extinction or adaptation. This includes the evolution of Earth&#x27;s climate and geology, and their potential impact on the habitability of the planet in the future, especially for humans.

Human impact on the biosphere: Scientists are studying the ways in which human activities, such as deforestation, pollution, and the introduction of invasive species, are affecting the biosphere and the long-term survival of life on Earth.

Long-term preservation of life: Researchers are exploring ways to preserve samples of life on Earth for long periods of time, such as cryopreservation and genomic preservation, in the event of a catastrophic event that could wipe out most of life on Earth.

===Finding biosignatures on other worlds===
Emerging astrobiological research concerning the search for planetary biosignatures of past or present extraterrestrial life utilise methodologies within planetary sciences. These include: 
The study of microbial life in the subsurface of Mars: Scientists are using data from Mars rover missions to study the composition of the subsurface of Mars, searching for biosignatures of past or present microbial life.

The study of liquid bodies on icy moons: Discoveries of surface and subsurface bodies of liquid on moons such as Europa, Titan and Enceladus showed possible habitability zones, making them viable targets for the search for extraterrestrial life. , missions like &quot;Europa Clipper&quot; and &quot;Dragonfly&quot; are planned to search for biosignatures within these environments. 

The study of the atmospheres of planets: Scientists are studying the potential for life to exist in the atmospheres of planets, with a focus on the study of the physical and chemical conditions necessary for such life to exist, namely the detection of organic molecules and biosignature gases; for example, the study of the possibility of life in the atmospheres of exoplanets that orbit red dwarfs and the study of the potential for microbial life in the upper atmosphere of Venus.

Telescopes and remote sensing of exoplanets: The discovery of thousands of exoplanets has opened up new opportunities for the search for biosignatures. Scientists are using telescopes such as the James Webb Space Telescope and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite to search for biosignatures on exoplanets. They are also developing new techniques for the detection of biosignatures, such as the use of remote sensing to search for biosignatures in the atmosphere of exoplanets.

===Talking to extraterrestrials===

;SETI and CETI
Scientists search for signals from intelligent extraterrestrial civilizations using radio and optical telescopes within the discipline of extraterrestrial intelligence communications (CETI). CETI focuses on composing and deciphering messages that could theoretically be understood by another technological civilization. Communication attempts by humans have included broadcasting mathematical languages, pictorial systems such as the Arecibo message, and computational approaches to detecting and deciphering &#x27;natural&#x27; language communication. While some high-profile scientists, such as Carl Sagan, have advocated the transmission of messages, theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking warned against it, suggesting that aliens may raid Earth for its resources.

===Investigating the early Earth===
Emerging astrobiological research concerning the study of the origin and early evolution of life on Earth utilises methodologies within the palaeosciences. These include:

The study of the early atmosphere: Researchers are investigating the role of the early atmosphere in providing the right conditions for the emergence of life, such as the presence of gases that could have helped to stabilise the climate and the formation of organic molecules.

The study of the early magnetic field: Researchers are investigating the role of the early magnetic field in protecting the Earth from harmful radiation and helping to stabilise the climate. This research has immense astrobiological implications where the subjects of current astrobiological research like Mars lack such a field.

The study of prebiotic chemistry: Scientists are studying the chemical reactions that could have occurred on the early Earth that led to the formation of the building blocks of life- amino acids, nucleotides, and lipids- and how these molecules could have formed spontaneously under early Earth conditions. 

The study of impact events: Scientists are investigating the potential role of impact events- especially meteorites- in the delivery of water and organic molecules to early Earth.

The study of the primordial soup: Researchers are investigating the conditions and ingredients that were present on the early Earth that could have led to the formation of the first living organisms, such as the presence of water and organic molecules, and how these ingredients could have led to the formation of the first living organisms. This includes the role of water in the formation of the first cells and in catalysing chemical reactions.

The study of the role of minerals: Scientists are investigating the role of minerals like clay in catalysing the formation of organic molecules, thus playing a role in the emergence of life on Earth.

The study of the role of energy and electricity: Scientists are investigating the potential sources of energy and electricity that could have been available on the early Earth, and their role in the formation of organic molecules, thus the emergence of life.

The study of the early oceans: Scientists are investigating the composition and chemistry of the early oceans and how it may have played a role in the emergence of life, such as the presence of dissolved minerals that could have helped to catalyse the formation of organic molecules.

The study of hydrothermal vents: Scientists are investigating the potential role of hydrothermal vents in the origin of life, as these environments may have provided the energy and chemical building blocks needed for its emergence.

The study of plate tectonics: Scientists are investigating the role of plate tectonics in creating a diverse range of environments on the early Earth.

The study of the early biosphere: Researchers are investigating the diversity and activity of microorganisms in the early Earth, and how these organisms may have played a role in the emergence of life.

The study of microbial fossils: Scientists are investigating the presence of microbial fossils in ancient rocks, which can provide clues about the early evolution of life on Earth and the emergence of the first organisms.

==Research==

The systematic search for possible life outside Earth is a valid multidisciplinary scientific endeavor. However, hypotheses and predictions as to its existence and origin vary widely, and at the present, the development of hypotheses firmly grounded on science may be considered astrobiology&#x27;s most concrete practical application. It has been proposed that viruses are likely to be encountered on other life-bearing planets, and may be present even if there are no biological cells.

=== Research outcomes ===
, no evidence of extraterrestrial life has been identified. Examination of the Allan Hills 84001 meteorite, which was recovered in Antarctica in 1984 and originated from Mars, is thought by David McKay, as well as few other scientists, to contain microfossils of extraterrestrial origin; this interpretation is controversial.

Yamato 000593, the second largest meteorite from Mars, was found on Earth in 2000. At a microscopic level, spheres are found in the meteorite that are rich in carbon compared to surrounding areas that lack such spheres. The carbon-rich spheres may have been formed by biotic activity according to some NASA scientists.

On 5 March 2011, Richard B. Hoover, a scientist with the Marshall Space Flight Center, speculated on the finding of alleged microfossils similar to cyanobacteria in CI1 carbonaceous meteorites in the fringe &quot;Journal of Cosmology&quot;, a story widely reported on by mainstream media. However, NASA formally distanced itself from Hoover&#x27;s claim. According to American astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson: &quot;At the moment, life on Earth is the only known life in the universe, but there are compelling arguments to suggest we are not alone.&quot;

===Elements of astrobiology===

==== Astronomy ====

Most astronomy-related astrobiology research falls into the category of extrasolar planet (exoplanet) detection, the hypothesis being that if life arose on Earth, then it could also arise on other planets with similar characteristics. To that end, a number of instruments designed to detect Earth-sized exoplanets have been considered, most notably NASA&#x27;s Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF) and ESA&#x27;s Darwin programs, both of which have been cancelled. NASA launched the Kepler mission in March 2009, and the French Space Agency launched the COROT space mission in 2006. There are also several less ambitious ground-based efforts underway.

The goal of these missions is not only to detect Earth-sized planets but also to directly detect light from the planet so that it may be studied spectroscopically. By examining planetary spectra, it would be possible to determine the basic composition of an extrasolar planet&#x27;s atmosphere and/or surface. Given this knowledge, it may be possible to assess the likelihood of life being found on that planet. A NASA research group, the Virtual Planet Laboratory, is using computer modeling to generate a wide variety of virtual planets to see what they would look like if viewed by TPF or Darwin. It is hoped that once these missions come online, their spectra can be cross-checked with these virtual planetary spectra for features that might indicate the presence of life.

An estimate for the number of planets with intelligent &quot;communicative&quot; extraterrestrial life can be gleaned from the Drake equation, essentially an equation expressing the probability of intelligent life as the product of factors such as the fraction of planets that might be habitable and the fraction of planets on which life might arise:
:formula_1
where:
* N = The number of communicative civilizations
* R* = The rate of formation of suitable stars (stars such as the Sun)
* fp = The fraction of those stars with planets (current evidence indicates that planetary systems may be common for stars like the Sun)
* ne = The number of Earth-sized worlds per planetary system
* fl = The fraction of those Earth-sized planets where life actually develops
* fi = The fraction of life sites where intelligence develops
* fc = The fraction of communicative planets (those on which electromagnetic communications technology develops)
* L = The &quot;lifetime&quot; of communicating civilizations

However, whilst the rationale behind the equation is sound, it is unlikely that the equation will be constrained to reasonable limits of error any time soon. The problem with the formula is that it is not used to generate or support hypotheses because it contains factors that can never be verified. The first term, R*, number of stars, is generally constrained within a few orders of magnitude. The second and third terms, &quot;fp&quot;, stars with planets and &quot;fe&quot;, planets with habitable conditions, are being evaluated for the star&#x27;s neighborhood. Drake originally formulated the equation merely as an agenda for discussion at the Green Bank conference, but some applications of the formula had been taken literally and related to simplistic or pseudoscientific arguments. Another associated topic is the Fermi paradox, which suggests that if intelligent life is common in the universe, then there should be obvious signs of it.

Another active research area in astrobiology is planetary system formation. It has been suggested that the peculiarities of the Solar System (for example, the presence of Jupiter as a protective shield) may have greatly increased the probability of intelligent life arising on Earth.

====Biology====

Biology cannot state that a process or phenomenon, by being mathematically possible, has to exist forcibly in an extraterrestrial body. Biologists specify what is speculative and what is not. The discovery of extremophiles, organisms able to survive in extreme environments, became a core research element for astrobiologists, as they are important to understand four areas in the limits of life in planetary context: the potential for panspermia, forward contamination due to human exploration ventures, planetary colonization by humans, and the exploration of extinct and extant extraterrestrial life.

Until the 1970s, life was thought to be entirely dependent on energy from the Sun. Plants on Earth&#x27;s surface capture energy from sunlight to photosynthesize sugars from carbon dioxide and water, releasing oxygen in the process that is then consumed by oxygen-respiring organisms, passing their energy up the food chain. Even life in the ocean depths, where sunlight cannot reach, was thought to obtain its nourishment either from consuming organic detritus rained down from the surface waters or from eating animals that did. The world&#x27;s ability to support life was thought to depend on its access to sunlight. However, in 1977, during an exploratory dive to the Galapagos Rift in the deep-sea exploration submersible &quot;Alvin&quot;, scientists discovered colonies of giant tube worms, clams, crustaceans, mussels, and other assorted creatures clustered around undersea volcanic features known as black smokers. These creatures thrive despite having no access to sunlight, and it was soon discovered that they form an entirely independent ecosystem. Although most of these multicellular lifeforms need dissolved oxygen (produced by oxygenic photosynthesis) for their aerobic cellular respiration and thus are not completely independent from sunlight by themselves, the basis for their food chain is a form of bacterium that derives its energy from oxidization of reactive chemicals, such as hydrogen or hydrogen sulfide, that bubble up from the Earth&#x27;s interior. Other lifeforms entirely decoupled from the energy from sunlight are green sulfur bacteria which are capturing geothermal light for anoxygenic photosynthesis or bacteria running chemolithoautotrophy based on the radioactive decay of uranium. This chemosynthesis revolutionized the study of biology and astrobiology by revealing that life need not be sunlight-dependent; it only requires water and an energy gradient in order to exist.

Biologists have found extremophiles that thrive in ice, boiling water, acid, alkali, the water core of nuclear reactors, salt crystals, toxic waste and in a range of other extreme habitats that were previously thought to be inhospitable for life. This opened up a new avenue in astrobiology by massively expanding the number of possible extraterrestrial habitats. Characterization of these organisms, their environments and their evolutionary pathways, is considered a crucial component to understanding how life might evolve elsewhere in the universe. For example, some organisms able to withstand exposure to the vacuum and radiation of outer space include the lichen fungi &quot;Rhizocarpon geographicum&quot; and &quot;Rusavskia elegans&quot;, the bacterium &quot;Bacillus safensis&quot;, &quot;Deinococcus radiodurans&quot;, &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot;, yeast &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;, seeds from &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; (&#x27;mouse-ear cress&#x27;), as well as the invertebrate animal Tardigrade. While tardigrades are not considered true extremophiles, they are considered extremotolerant microorganisms that have contributed to the field of astrobiology. Their extreme radiation tolerance and presence of DNA protection proteins may provide answers as to whether life can survive away from the protection of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

Jupiter&#x27;s moon, Europa, and Saturn&#x27;s moon, Enceladus, are now considered the most likely locations for extant extraterrestrial life in the Solar System due to their subsurface water oceans where radiogenic and tidal heating enables liquid water to exist.

The origin of life, known as abiogenesis, distinct from the evolution of life, is another ongoing field of research. Oparin and Haldane postulated that the conditions on the early Earth were conducive to the formation of organic compounds from inorganic elements and thus to the formation of many of the chemicals common to all forms of life we see today. The study of this process, known as prebiotic chemistry, has made some progress, but it is still unclear whether or not life could have formed in such a manner on Earth. The alternative hypothesis of panspermia is that the first elements of life may have formed on another planet with even more favorable conditions (or even in interstellar space, asteroids, etc.) and then have been carried over to Earth.

The cosmic dust permeating the universe contains complex organic compounds (&quot;amorphous organic solids with a mixed aromatic-aliphatic structure&quot;) that could be created naturally, and rapidly, by stars. Further, a scientist suggested that these compounds may have been related to the development of life on Earth and said that, &quot;If this is the case, life on Earth may have had an easier time getting started as these organics can serve as basic ingredients for life.&quot;

More than 20% of the carbon in the universe may be associated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), possible starting materials for the formation of life. PAHs seem to have been formed shortly after the Big Bang, are widespread throughout the universe, and are associated with new stars and exoplanets. PAHs are subjected to interstellar medium conditions and are transformed through hydrogenation, oxygenation and hydroxylation, to more complex organics—&quot;a step along the path toward amino acids and nucleotides, the raw materials of proteins and DNA, respectively&quot;.

In October 2020, astronomers proposed the idea of detecting life on distant planets by studying the shadows of trees at certain times of the day to find patterns that could be detected through observation of exoplanets.

== Philosophy ==
David Grinspoon called astrobiology a field of natural philosophy. Astrobiology intersects with philosophy by raising questions about the nature and existence of life beyond Earth. Philosophical implications include the definition of life itself, issues in the philosophy of mind and cognitive science in case intelligent life is found, epistemological questions about the nature of proof, ethical considerations of space exploration, along with the broader impact of discovering extraterrestrial life on human thought and society.

Dunér has emphasized philosophy of astrobiology as an ongoing existential exercise in individual and collective self-understanding, whose major task is constructing and debating concepts such as the concept of life. Key issues, for Dunér, are questions of resource money and monetary planning, epistemological questions regarding astrobiological knowledge, linguistics issues about interstellar communication, cognitive issues such as the definition of intelligence, along with the possibility of interplanetary contamination.
Persson also emphasized key philosophical questions in astrobiology. They include ethical justification of resources, the question of life in general, the epistemological issues and knowledge about being alone in the universe, ethics towards extraterrestrial life, the question of politics and governing uninhabited worlds, along with questions of ecology.

For von Hegner, the question of astrobiology and the possibility of astrophilosophy differs. For him, the discipline needs to bifurcate into astrobiology and astrophilosophy since discussions made possible by astrobiology, but which have been astrophilosophical in nature, have existed as long as there have been discussions about extraterrestrial life. Astrobiology is a self-corrective interaction among observation, hypothesis, experiment, and theory, pertaining to the exploration of all natural phenomena. Astrophilosophy consists of methods of dialectic analysis and logical argumentation, pertaining to the clarification of the nature of reality. Šekrst argues that astrobiology requires the affirmation of astrophilosophy, but not as a separate cognate to astrobiology. The stance of conceptual speciesm, according to Šekrst, permeates astrobiology since the very name astrobiology tries to talk about not just biology, but about life in a general way, which includes terrestrial life as a subset. This leads us to either redefine philosophy, or consider the need for astrophilosophy as a more general discipline, to which philosophy is just a subset that deals with questions such as the nature of the human mind and other anthropocentric questions.

Most of the philosophy of astrobiology deals with two main questions: the question of life and the ethics of space exploration. Kolb specifically emphasizes the question of viruses, for which the question whether they are alive or not is based on the definitions of life that include self-replication. Schneider tried to defined exo-life, but concluded that we often start with our own prejudices and that defining extraterrestrial life seems futile using human concepts. For Dick, astrobiology relies on metaphysical assumption that there is extraterrestrial life, which reaffirms questions in the philosophy of cosmology, such as fine-tuning or the anthropic principle.

== Rare Earth hypothesis ==
The Rare Earth hypothesis postulates that multicellular life forms found on Earth may actually be more of a rarity than scientists assume. According to this hypothesis, life on Earth (and more, multi-cellular life) is possible because of a conjunction of the right circumstances (galaxy and location within it, planetary system, star, orbit, planetary size, atmosphere, etc.); and the chance for all those circumstances to repeat elsewhere may be rare. It provides a possible answer to the Fermi paradox which wonders: if extraterrestrial aliens are common, why aren&#x27;t they obvious? It is apparently in opposition to the principle of mediocrity, assumed by famed astronomers Frank Drake, Carl Sagan, and others. The principle of mediocrity suggests that life on Earth is not exceptional, and it is more than likely to be found on innumerable other worlds.

== Missions ==
Research into the environmental limits of life and the workings of extreme ecosystems is ongoing, enabling researchers to better predict what planetary environments might be most likely to harbor life. Missions such as the &quot;Phoenix&quot; lander, Mars Science Laboratory, ExoMars, Mars 2020 rover to Mars, and the &quot;Cassini&quot; probe to Saturn&#x27;s moons aim to further explore the possibilities of life on other planets in the Solar System.

;Viking program

The two Viking landers each carried four types of biological experiments to the surface of Mars in the late 1970s. These were the only Mars landers to carry out experiments looking specifically for metabolism by current microbial life on Mars. The landers used a robotic arm to collect soil samples into sealed test containers on the craft. The two landers were identical, so the same tests were carried out at two places on Mars&#x27; surface; &quot;Viking 1&quot; near the equator and &quot;Viking 2&quot; further north. The result was inconclusive, and is still disputed by some scientists.
Norman Horowitz was the chief of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory bioscience section for the Mariner and Viking missions from 1965 to 1976. Horowitz considered that the great versatility of the carbon atom makes it the element most likely to provide solutions, even exotic solutions, to the problems of survival of life on other planets. However, he also considered that the conditions found on Mars were incompatible with carbon based life.

;&quot;Beagle 2&quot;
&quot;Beagle 2&quot; was an unsuccessful British Mars lander that formed part of the European Space Agency&#x27;s 2003 Mars Express mission. Its primary purpose was to search for signs of life on Mars, past or present. Although it landed safely, it was unable to correctly deploy its solar panels and telecom antenna.

;EXPOSE
EXPOSE is a multi-user facility mounted in 2008 outside the International Space Station dedicated to astrobiology. EXPOSE was developed by the European Space Agency (ESA) for long-term spaceflights that allow exposure of organic chemicals and biological samples to outer space in low Earth orbit.

;Mars Science Laboratory
The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission landed the &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover that is currently in operation on Mars. It was launched 26 November 2011, and landed at Gale Crater on 6 August 2012. Mission objectives are to help assess Mars&#x27; habitability and in doing so, determine whether Mars is or has ever been able to support life, collect data for a future human mission, study Martian geology, its climate, and further assess the role that water, an essential ingredient for life as we know it, played in forming minerals on Mars.

;&quot;Tanpopo&quot;
The &quot;Tanpopo&quot; mission is an orbital astrobiology experiment investigating the potential interplanetary transfer of life, organic compounds, and possible terrestrial particles in the low Earth orbit. The purpose is to assess the panspermia hypothesis and the possibility of natural interplanetary transport of microbial life as well as prebiotic organic compounds. Early mission results show evidence that some clumps of microorganism can survive for at least one year in space. This may support the idea that clumps greater than 0.5 millimeters of microorganisms could be one way for life to spread from planet to planet.

;&quot;ExoMars&quot; rover

&quot;ExoMars&quot; is a robotic mission to Mars to search for possible biosignatures of Martian life, past or present. This astrobiological mission was under development by the European Space Agency (ESA) in partnership with the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos); it was planned for a 2022 launch; however, technical and funding issues and the Russian invasion of Ukraine have forced ESA to repeatedly delay the rover&#x27;s delivery to 2028.

;Mars 2020

Mars 2020 successfully landed its rover &quot;Perseverance&quot; in Jezero Crater on 18 February 2021. It will investigate environments on Mars relevant to astrobiology, investigate its surface geological processes and history, including the assessment of its past habitability and potential for preservation of biosignatures and biomolecules within accessible geological materials. The Science Definition Team is proposing the rover collect and package at least 31 samples of rock cores and soil for a later mission to bring back for more definitive analysis in laboratories on Earth. The rover could make measurements and technology demonstrations to help designers of a human expedition understand any hazards posed by Martian dust and demonstrate how to collect carbon dioxide (CO2), which could be a resource for making molecular oxygen (O2) and rocket fuel.

;&quot;Europa Clipper&quot;
&quot;Europa Clipper&quot; is a mission launched by NASA on 14 October 2024 that will conduct detailed reconnaissance of Jupiter&#x27;s moon Europa beginning in 2030, and will investigate whether its internal ocean could harbor conditions suitable for life. It will also aid in the selection of future landing sites.

;&quot;Dragonfly&quot;
&quot;Dragonfly&quot; is a NASA mission scheduled to land on Titan in 2036 to assess its microbial habitability and study its prebiotic chemistry. Dragonfly is a rotorcraft lander that will perform controlled flights between multiple locations on the surface, which allows sampling of diverse regions and geological contexts.

===Proposed concepts===

;&quot;Icebreaker Life&quot;
&quot;Icebreaker Life&quot; is a lander mission that was proposed for NASA&#x27;s Discovery Program for the 2021 launch opportunity, but it was not selected for development. It would have had a stationary lander that would be a near copy of the successful 2008 &quot;Phoenix&quot; and it would have carried an upgraded astrobiology scientific payload, including a 1-meter-long core drill to sample ice-cemented ground in the northern plains to conduct a search for organic molecules and evidence of current or past life on Mars. One of the key goals of the &quot;Icebreaker Life&quot; mission is to test the hypothesis that the ice-rich ground in the polar regions has significant concentrations of organics due to protection by the ice from oxidants and radiation.

;&quot;Journey to Enceladus and Titan&quot;
&quot;Journey to Enceladus and Titan&quot; (&quot;JET&quot;) is an astrobiology mission concept to assess the habitability potential of Saturn&#x27;s moons Enceladus and Titan by means of an orbiter.

;&quot;Enceladus Life Finder&quot;
&quot;Enceladus Life Finder&quot; (&quot;ELF&quot;) is a proposed astrobiology mission concept for a space probe intended to assess the habitability of the internal aquatic ocean of Enceladus, Saturn&#x27;s sixth-largest moon.

;&quot;Life Investigation For Enceladus&quot;
&quot;Life Investigation For Enceladus&quot; (&quot;LIFE&quot;) is a proposed astrobiology sample-return mission concept. The spacecraft would enter into Saturn orbit and enable multiple flybys through Enceladus&#x27; icy plumes to collect icy plume particles and volatiles and return them to Earth on a capsule. The spacecraft may sample Enceladus&#x27; plumes, the E ring of Saturn, and the upper atmosphere of Titan.

;&quot;Oceanus&quot;
&quot;Oceanus&quot; is an orbiter proposed in 2017 for the New Frontiers mission No. 4. It would travel to the moon of Saturn, Titan, to assess its habitability. &quot;Oceanus&quot;″ objectives are to reveal Titan&#x27;s organic chemistry, geology, gravity, topography, collect 3D reconnaissance data, catalog the organics and determine where they may interact with liquid water.

;&quot;Explorer of Enceladus and Titan&quot;
&quot;Explorer of Enceladus and Titan&quot; (E2T) is an orbiter mission concept that would investigate the evolution and habitability of the Saturnian satellites Enceladus and Titan. The mission concept was proposed in 2017 by the European Space Agency.

<text>An air show (or airshow, air fair, air tattoo) is a public event where aircraft are exhibited. They often include aerobatics demonstrations, without they are called &quot;static air shows&quot; with aircraft parked on the ground.

The largest air show measured by number of exhibitors and size of exhibit space is Le Bourget, followed by Farnborough, with the Dubai Airshow and Singapore Airshow both claiming third place. The largest air show or fly-in by number of participating aircraft is EAA AirVenture Oshkosh, with approximately 10,000 aircraft participating annually. The biggest military airshow in the world is the Royal International Air Tattoo, at RAF Fairford in England. On the other hand, FIDAE in II Air Brigade of the FACH, next to the Arturo Merino Benítez International Airport in Santiago, Chile, is the largest aerospace fair in Latin America and the Southern Hemisphere.

==Outline==
Some airshows are held as a business venture or as a trade event where aircraft, avionics and other services are promoted to potential customers. Many air shows are held in support of local, national or military charities. Military air firms often organise air shows at military airfields as a public relations exercise to thank the local community, promote military careers and raise the profile of the military.

Air &quot;seasons&quot; vary around the world. The United States enjoys a long season that generally runs from March to November, covering the spring, summer, and fall seasons. Other countries often have much shorter seasons. In Japan air shows are generally events held at Japan Air Self-Defense Force bases regularly throughout the year. The European season usually starts in late April or Early May and is usually over by mid October. The Middle East, Australia, and New Zealand hold their events between January and March. However, for many acts, the &quot;off-season&quot; does not mean a period of inactivity; pilots and performers use this time for maintenance and practice.

The type of displays seen at shows are constrained by a number of factors, including the weather and visibility. Most aviation authorities now publish rules and guidance on minimum display heights and criteria for differing conditions. In addition to the weather, pilots and organizers must also consider local airspace restrictions. Most exhibitors will plan &quot;full&quot;, &quot;rolling&quot; and &quot;flat&quot; display for varying weather and airspace conditions.

The types of shows vary greatly. Some are large scale military events with large flying displays and ground exhibitions while others held at small local airstrips can often feature just one or two hours of flying with just a few stalls on the ground. Air displays can be held during day or night with the latter becoming increasingly popular. Air shows often, but do not always, take place over airfields; some have been held over the grounds of stately homes or castles and over the sea at coastal resorts.

The first public international airshow, at which many types of aircraft were displayed and flown, was the Grande Semaine d&#x27;Aviation de la Champagne, held Aug. 22–29, 1909 in Reims. This had been preceded by what may have been the first ever gathering of enthusiasts, June 28 – July 19 of the same year at the airfield at La Brayelle, near Douai.

==Attractions==
Before World War II, air shows were associated with long-distance air races, often lasting many days and covering thousands of miles. While the Reno Air Races keep this tradition alive, most air shows today primarily feature a series of aerial demos of short duration.

Most air shows feature warbirds, aerobatics, and demonstrations of modern military aircraft, and many air shows offer a variety of other aeronautical attractions as well, such as wing-walking, radio-controlled aircraft, water/slurry drops from firefighting aircraft, simulated helicopter rescues and sky diving.

Specialist aerobatic aircraft have powerful piston engines, light weight and big control surfaces, making them capable of very high roll rates and accelerations. A skilled pilot will be able to climb vertically, perform very tight turns, tumble his aircraft end-over-end and perform manoeuvres during loops.

Larger airshows can be headlined by military jet demonstration teams, such as the United States Navy Blue Angels, United States Air Force Thunderbirds, Royal Canadian Air Force Snowbirds, Royal Air Force Red Arrows, and Swiss Air Force Patrouille Suisse, among many others.

Solo military demos, also known as tactical demos, feature one aircraft. The demonstration focuses on the capabilities of modern military aircraft. The display will usually demonstrate the aircraft&#x27;s very short (and often very loud) rolls, fast speeds, slow approach speeds, as well as their ability to quickly make tight turns, to climb quickly, and their ability to be precisely controlled at a large range of speeds. Manoeuvres include aileron rolls, barrel rolls, hesitation rolls, Cuban-8s, tight turns, high-alpha flight, a high-speed pass, double Immelmans, and touch-and-gos. Tactical demos may include simulated bomb drops, sometimes with pyrotechnics on the ground for effect. Aircraft with special characteristics that give them unique capabilities will often display those in their demos; For example, Russian fighters with thrust vectoring may be used to perform the cobra maneuver or the Kulbit, while VTOL aircraft such as the Harrier may display such vertical capabilities or perform complex maneuvers with them. Some military air shows also feature demonstrations of aircraft ordnance in airstrikes and close air support, using either blanks or live munitions.

==Safety==
Air shows may present some risk to spectators and aviators. Accidents have occurred, sometimes with a large loss of life, such as the 1988 Ramstein air show disaster (70 deaths) in Germany and the 2002 Sknyliv air show disaster (77 deaths) in Ukraine.

Because of these accidents, the various aviation authorities around the world have set rules and guidance for those running and participating in air displays. For example, after the breakup of an aircraft at 1952 Farnborough air show (31 deaths), the separation between display and spectators was increased. Air displays are often monitored by aviation authorities to ensure safe procedures.

In the United Kingdom, local authorities will first need to approve any application for an event to which the public is admitted. The first priority must be to arrange insurance cover and details can be obtained from local authorities. An added complication is a whole raft of legislation concerning health &amp; safety, in particular corporate manslaughter, which can involve the event organiser being charged with a criminal offence if any of the insurances and risk assessments are not fully completed well in advance of the event.

Rules govern the distance from the crowds that aircraft must fly. These vary according to the rating of the pilot/crew, the type of aircraft and the way the aircraft is being flown. For instance, slower, lighter aircraft are usually allowed closer and lower to the crowd than larger, faster types. Also, a fighter jet flying straight and level will be able to do so closer to the crowd and lower than if it were performing a roll or a loop.

Pilots can get authorizations for differing types of displays (e.g., limbo flying, basic aerobatics to unlimited aerobatics) and to differing minimum base heights above the ground. To gain such authorisations, the pilots will have to demonstrate to an examiner that they can perform to those limits without endangering themselves, ground crew or spectators.

Despite display rules and guidances, accidents have continued to happen. However, air show accidents are rare and where there is proper supervision air shows have impressive safety records. Each year, organizations such as International Council of Air Shows and European Airshow Council meet and discuss various subjects including air show safety where accidents are discussed and lessons learned.

<doc id="2792" wikidata="Q240581" url="?curid=2792" title="Anthropic principle">
<text>In cosmology, the anthropic principle, also known as the observation selection effect, is the proposition that the range of possible observations that could be made about the universe is limited by the fact that observations are only possible in the type of universe that is capable of developing observers in the first place. Proponents of the anthropic principle argue that it explains why the universe has the age and the fundamental physical constants necessary to accommodate intelligent life. If either had been significantly different, no one would have been around to make observations. Anthropic reasoning has been used to address the question as to why certain measured physical constants take the values that they do, rather than some other arbitrary values, and to explain a perception that the universe appears to be finely tuned for the existence of life.

There are many different formulations of the anthropic principle. Philosopher Nick Bostrom counts thirty, but the underlying principles can be divided into &quot;weak&quot; and &quot;strong&quot; forms, depending on the types of cosmological claims they entail.

== Definition and basis ==

The principle was formulated as a response to a series of observations that the laws of nature and parameters of the universe have values that are consistent with conditions for life as it is known rather than values that would not be consistent with life on Earth. The anthropic principle states that this is an&quot; a posteriori&quot; necessity, because if life were impossible, no living entity would be there to observe it, and thus it would not be known. That is, it must be possible to observe &quot;some&quot; universe, and hence, the laws and constants of any such universe must accommodate that possibility.

The term &quot;&quot; in &quot;anthropic principle&quot; has been argued to be a misnomer. While singling out the currently observable kind of carbon-based life, none of the finely tuned phenomena require human life or some kind of carbon chauvinism. Any form of life or any form of heavy atom, stone, star, or galaxy would do; nothing specifically human or anthropic is involved.

The anthropic principle has given rise to some confusion and controversy, partly because the phrase has been applied to several distinct ideas. All versions of the principle have been accused of discouraging the search for a deeper physical understanding of the universe. Critics of the weak anthropic principle point out that its lack of falsifiability entails that it is non-scientific and therefore inherently not useful. Stronger variants of the anthropic principle which are not tautologies can still make claims considered controversial by some; these would be contingent upon empirical verification.

== Anthropic observations ==

In 1961, Robert Dicke noted that the age of the universe, as seen by living observers, cannot be random. Instead, biological factors constrain the universe to be more or less in a &quot;golden age&quot;, neither too young nor too old. If the universe was one tenth as old as its present age, there would not have been sufficient time to build up appreciable levels of metallicity (levels of elements besides hydrogen and helium) especially carbon, by nucleosynthesis. Small rocky planets did not yet exist. If the universe were 10 times older than it actually is, most stars would be too old to remain on the main sequence and would have turned into white dwarfs, aside from the dimmest red dwarfs, and stable planetary systems would have already come to an end. Thus, Dicke explained the coincidence between large dimensionless numbers constructed from the constants of physics and the age of the universe, a coincidence that inspired Dirac&#x27;s varying-&quot;G&quot; theory.

Dicke later reasoned that the density of matter in the universe must be almost exactly the critical density needed to prevent the Big Crunch (the &quot;Dicke coincidences&quot; argument). The most recent measurements may suggest that the observed density of baryonic matter, and some theoretical predictions of the amount of dark matter, account for about 30% of this critical density, with the rest contributed by a cosmological constant. Steven Weinberg gave an anthropic explanation for this fact: he noted that the cosmological constant has a remarkably low value, some 120 orders of magnitude smaller than the value particle physics predicts (this has been described as the &quot;worst prediction in physics&quot;). However, if the cosmological constant were only several orders of magnitude larger than its observed value, the universe would suffer catastrophic inflation, which would preclude the formation of stars, and hence life.

The observed values of the dimensionless physical constants (such as the fine-structure constant) governing the four fundamental interactions are balanced as if fine-tuned to permit the formation of commonly found matter and subsequently the emergence of life. A slight increase in the strong interaction (up to 50% for some authors) would bind the dineutron and the diproton and convert all hydrogen in the early universe to helium; likewise, an increase in the weak interaction also would convert all hydrogen to helium. Water, as well as sufficiently long-lived stable stars, both essential for the emergence of life as it is known, would not exist. More generally, small changes in the relative strengths of the four fundamental interactions can greatly affect the universe&#x27;s age, structure, and capacity for life.

== Origin ==

The phrase &quot;anthropic principle&quot; first appeared in Brandon Carter&#x27;s contribution to a 1973 Kraków symposium honouring Copernicus&#x27;s 500th birthday. Carter, a theoretical astrophysicist, articulated the Anthropic Principle in reaction to the Copernican Principle, which states that humans do not occupy a privileged position in the Universe. Carter said: &quot;Although our situation is not necessarily &quot;central&quot;, it is inevitably privileged to some extent.&quot; Specifically, Carter disagreed with using the Copernican principle to justify the Perfect Cosmological Principle, which states that all large regions &quot;and times&quot; in the universe must be statistically identical. The latter principle underlies the steady-state theory, which had recently been falsified by the 1965 discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation. This discovery was unequivocal evidence that the universe has changed radically over time (for example, via the Big Bang).

Carter defined two forms of the anthropic principle, a &quot;weak&quot; one which referred only to anthropic selection of privileged spacetime locations in the universe, and a more controversial &quot;strong&quot; form that addressed the values of the fundamental constants of physics.

Roger Penrose explained the weak form as follows:

One reason this is plausible is that there are many other places and times in which humans could have evolved. But when applying the strong principle, there is only one universe, with one set of fundamental parameters, so what exactly is the point being made? Carter offers two possibilities: First, humans can use their own existence to make &quot;predictions&quot; about the parameters. But second, &quot;as a last resort&quot;, humans can convert these predictions into &quot;explanations&quot; by assuming that there &quot;is&quot; more than one universe, in fact a large and possibly infinite collection of universes, something that is now called the multiverse (&quot;world ensemble&quot; was Carter&#x27;s term), in which the parameters (and perhaps the laws of physics) vary across universes. The strong principle then becomes an example of a selection effect, exactly analogous to the weak principle. Postulating a multiverse is certainly a radical step, but taking it could provide at least a partial answer to a question seemingly out of the reach of normal science: &quot;Why do the fundamental laws of physics take the particular form we observe and not another?&quot;

Since Carter&#x27;s 1973 paper, the term &quot;anthropic principle&quot; has been extended to cover a number of ideas that differ in important ways from his. Particular confusion was caused by the 1986 book &quot;The Anthropic Cosmological Principle&quot; by John D. Barrow and Frank Tipler, which distinguished between a &quot;weak&quot; and &quot;strong&quot; anthropic principle in a way very different from Carter&#x27;s, as discussed in the next section.

Carter was not the first to invoke some form of the anthropic principle. In fact, the evolutionary biologist Alfred Russel Wallace anticipated the anthropic principle as long ago as 1904: &quot;Such a vast and complex universe as that which we know exists around us, may have been absolutely required [...] in order to produce a world that should be precisely adapted in every detail for the orderly development of life culminating in man.&quot; In 1957, Robert Dicke wrote: &quot;The age of the Universe &#x27;now&#x27; is not random but conditioned by biological factors [...] [changes in the values of the fundamental constants of physics] would preclude the existence of man to consider the problem.&quot;

Ludwig Boltzmann may have been one of the first in modern science to use anthropic reasoning. Prior to knowledge of the Big Bang Boltzmann&#x27;s thermodynamic concepts painted a picture of a universe that had inexplicably low entropy. Boltzmann suggested several explanations, one of which relied on fluctuations that could produce pockets of low entropy or Boltzmann universes. While most of the universe is featureless in this model, to Boltzmann, it is unremarkable that humanity happens to inhabit a Boltzmann universe, as that is the only place where intelligent life could be.

== Variants ==

Weak anthropic principle (WAP) (Carter): &quot;... our location in the universe is &quot;necessarily&quot; privileged to the extent of being compatible with our existence as observers.&quot; For Carter, &quot;location&quot; refers to our location in time as well as space.

Strong anthropic principle (SAP) (Carter): &quot;[T]he universe (and hence the fundamental parameters on which it depends) must be such as to admit the creation of observers within it at some stage. To paraphrase Descartes, &quot;cogito ergo mundus talis est&quot;.&quot;The Latin tag (&quot;I think, therefore the world is such [as it is]&quot;) makes it clear that &quot;must&quot; indicates a deduction from the fact of our existence; the statement is thus a truism.

In their 1986 book, &quot;The anthropic cosmological principle&quot;, John Barrow and Frank Tipler depart from Carter and define the WAP and SAP as follows:

Weak anthropic principle (WAP) (Barrow and Tipler): &quot;The observed values of all physical and cosmological quantities are not equally probable but they take on values restricted by the requirement that there exist sites where carbon-based life can evolve and by the requirements that the universe be old enough for it to have already done so.&quot;Unlike Carter they restrict the principle to carbon-based life, rather than just &quot;observers&quot;. A more important difference is that they apply the WAP to the fundamental physical constants, such as the fine-structure constant, the number of spacetime dimensions, and the cosmological constant—topics that fall under Carter&#x27;s SAP.

Strong anthropic principle (SAP) (Barrow and Tipler): &quot;The Universe must have those properties which allow life to develop within it at some stage in its history.&quot;This looks very similar to Carter&#x27;s SAP, but unlike the case with Carter&#x27;s SAP, the &quot;must&quot; is an imperative, as shown by the following three possible elaborations of the SAP, each proposed by Barrow and Tipler:
* &quot;There exists one possible Universe &#x27;designed&#x27; with the goal of generating and sustaining &#x27;observers&#x27;.&quot;
*: This can be seen as simply the classic design argument restated in the garb of contemporary cosmology. It implies that the purpose of the universe is to give rise to intelligent life, with the laws of nature and their fundamental physical constants set to ensure that life emerges and evolves.
* &quot;Observers are necessary to bring the Universe into being.&quot;
*: Barrow and Tipler believe that this is a valid conclusion from quantum mechanics, as John Archibald Wheeler has suggested, especially via his idea that information is the fundamental reality (see It from bit) and his Participatory anthropic principle (PAP) which is an interpretation of quantum mechanics associated with the ideas of John von Neumann and Eugene Wigner.
* &quot;An ensemble of other different universes is necessary for the existence of our Universe.&quot;
*: By contrast, Carter merely says that an ensemble of universes is necessary for the SAP to count as an explanation.

The philosophers John Leslie and Nick Bostrom reject the Barrow and Tipler SAP as a fundamental misreading of Carter. For Bostrom, Carter&#x27;s anthropic principle just warns us to make allowance for &quot;anthropic bias&quot;—that is, the bias created by anthropic selection effects (which Bostrom calls &quot;observation&quot; selection effects)—the necessity for observers to exist in order to get a result. He writes:

Strong self-sampling assumption (SSSA) (Bostrom): &quot;Each observer-moment should reason as if it were randomly selected from the class of all observer-moments in its reference class.&quot; Analysing an observer&#x27;s experience into a sequence of &quot;observer-moments&quot; helps avoid certain paradoxes; but the main ambiguity is the selection of the appropriate &quot;reference class&quot;: for Carter&#x27;s WAP this might correspond to all real or potential observer-moments in our universe; for the SAP, to all in the multiverse. Bostrom&#x27;s mathematical development shows that choosing either too broad or too narrow a reference class leads to counter-intuitive results, but he is not able to prescribe an ideal choice.

According to Jürgen Schmidhuber, the anthropic principle essentially just says that the conditional probability of finding yourself in a universe compatible with your existence is always 1. It does not allow for any additional nontrivial predictions such as &quot;gravity won&#x27;t change tomorrow&quot;. To gain more predictive power, additional assumptions on the prior distribution of alternative universes are necessary.

Playwright and novelist Michael Frayn describes a form of the strong anthropic principle in his 2006 book &quot;The Human Touch&quot;, which explores what he characterises as &quot;the central oddity of the Universe&quot;:

== Character of anthropic reasoning ==
Carter chose to focus on a tautological aspect of his ideas, which has resulted in much confusion. In fact, anthropic reasoning interests scientists because of something that is only implicit in the above formal definitions, namely that humans should give serious consideration to there being other universes with different values of the &quot;fundamental parameters&quot;—that is, the dimensionless physical constants and initial conditions for the Big Bang. Carter and others have argued that life would not be possible in most such universes. In other words, the universe humans live in is fine tuned to permit life. Collins &amp; Hawking (1973) characterized Carter&#x27;s then-unpublished big idea as the postulate that &quot;there is not one universe but a whole infinite ensemble of universes with all possible initial conditions&quot;. If this is granted, the anthropic principle provides a plausible explanation for the fine tuning of our universe: the &quot;typical&quot; universe is not fine-tuned, but given enough universes, a small fraction will be capable of supporting intelligent life. Ours must be one of these, and so the observed fine tuning should be no cause for wonder.

Although philosophers have discussed related concepts for centuries, in the early 1970s the only genuine physical theory yielding a multiverse of sorts was the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. This would allow variation in initial conditions, but not in the truly fundamental constants. Since that time a number of mechanisms for producing a multiverse have been suggested: see the review by Max Tegmark. An important development in the 1980s was the combination of inflation theory with the hypothesis that some parameters are determined by symmetry breaking in the early universe, which allows parameters previously thought of as &quot;fundamental constants&quot; to vary over very large distances, thus eroding the distinction between Carter&#x27;s weak and strong principles. At the beginning of the 21st century, the string landscape emerged as a mechanism for varying essentially all the constants, including the number of spatial dimensions.

The anthropic idea that fundamental parameters are selected from a multitude of different possibilities (each actual in some universe or other) contrasts with the traditional hope of physicists for a theory of everything having no free parameters. As Albert Einstein said: &quot;What really interests me is whether God had any choice in the creation of the world.&quot; In 2002, some proponents of the leading candidate for a &quot;theory of everything&quot;, string theory, proclaimed &quot;the end of the anthropic principle&quot; since there would be no free parameters to select. In 2003, however, Leonard Susskind stated: &quot;... it seems plausible that the landscape is unimaginably large and diverse. This is the behavior that gives credence to the anthropic principle.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;arXiv:hep-th/0302219&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern form of a design argument is put forth by intelligent design. Proponents of intelligent design often cite the fine-tuning observations that (in part) preceded the formulation of the anthropic principle by Carter as a proof of an intelligent designer. Opponents of intelligent design are not limited to those who hypothesize that other universes exist; they may also argue, anti-anthropically, that the universe is less fine-tuned than often claimed, or that accepting fine tuning as a brute fact is less astonishing than the idea of an intelligent creator. Furthermore, even accepting fine tuning, Sober (2005) and Ikeda and Jefferys, argue that the anthropic principle as conventionally stated actually undermines intelligent design.

Paul Davies&#x27;s book &quot;The Goldilocks Enigma&quot; (2006) reviews the current state of the fine-tuning debate in detail, and concludes by enumerating the following responses to that debate:
# The absurd universe: Our universe just happens to be the way it is.
# The unique universe: There is a deep underlying unity in physics that necessitates the Universe being the way it is. A Theory of Everything will explain why the various features of the Universe must have exactly the values that have been recorded.
# The multiverse: Multiple universes exist, having all possible combinations of characteristics, and humans inevitably find themselves within a universe that allows us to exist.
# Intelligent design: A creator designed the Universe with the purpose of supporting complexity and the emergence of intelligence.
# The life principle: There is an underlying principle that constrains the Universe to evolve towards life and mind.
# The self-explaining universe: A closed explanatory or causal loop: &quot;perhaps only universes with a capacity for consciousness can exist&quot;. This is Wheeler&#x27;s participatory anthropic principle (PAP).
# The fake universe: Humans live inside a virtual reality simulation.

Omitted here is Lee Smolin&#x27;s model of cosmological natural selection, also known as &quot;fecund universes&quot;, which proposes that universes have &quot;offspring&quot; that are more plentiful if they resemble our universe. Also see Gardner (2005).

Clearly each of these hypotheses resolve some aspects of the puzzle, while leaving others unanswered. Followers of Carter would admit only option 3 as an anthropic explanation, whereas 3 through 6 are covered by different versions of Barrow and Tipler&#x27;s SAP (which would also include 7 if it is considered a variant of 4, as in Tipler 1994).

The anthropic principle, at least as Carter conceived it, can be applied on scales much smaller than the whole universe. For example, Carter (1983) inverted the usual line of reasoning and pointed out that when interpreting the evolutionary record, one must take into account cosmological and astrophysical considerations. With this in mind, Carter concluded that given the best estimates of the age of the universe, the evolutionary chain culminating in &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; probably admits only one or two low probability links.

== Observational evidence ==
No possible observational evidence bears on Carter&#x27;s WAP, as it is merely advice to the scientist and asserts nothing debatable. The obvious test of Barrow&#x27;s SAP, which says that the universe is &quot;required&quot; to support life, is to find evidence of life in universes other than ours. Any other universe is, by most definitions, unobservable (otherwise it would be included in &quot;our&quot; portion of &quot;this&quot; universe). Thus, in principle Barrow&#x27;s SAP cannot be falsified by observing a universe in which an observer cannot exist.

Philosopher John Leslie states that the Carter SAP (with multiverse) predicts the following:
* Physical theory will evolve so as to strengthen the hypothesis that early phase transitions occur probabilistically rather than deterministically, in which case there will be no deep physical reason for the values of fundamental constants;
* Various theories for generating multiple universes will prove robust;
* Evidence that the universe is fine tuned will continue to accumulate;
* No life with a non-carbon chemistry will be discovered;
* Mathematical studies of galaxy formation will confirm that it is sensitive to the rate of expansion of the universe.

Hogan has emphasised that it would be very strange if all fundamental constants were strictly determined, since this would leave us with no ready explanation for apparent fine tuning. In fact, humans might have to resort to something akin to Barrow and Tipler&#x27;s SAP: there would be no option for such a universe &quot;not&quot; to support life.

Probabilistic predictions of parameter values can be made given:
# a particular multiverse with a &quot;measure&quot;, i.e. a well defined &quot;density of universes&quot; (so, for parameter &quot;X&quot;, one can calculate the prior probability &quot;P&quot;(&quot;X&quot;0) &quot;dX&quot; that &quot;X&quot; is in the range ), and
# an estimate of the number of observers in each universe, &quot;N&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) (e.g., this might be taken as proportional to the number of stars in the universe).
The probability of observing value &quot;X&quot; is then proportional to . A generic feature of an analysis of this nature is that the expected values of the fundamental physical constants should not be &quot;over-tuned&quot;, i.e. if there is some perfectly tuned predicted value (e.g. zero), the observed value need be no closer to that predicted value than what is required to make life possible. The small but finite value of the cosmological constant can be regarded as a successful prediction in this sense.

One thing that would &quot;not&quot; count as evidence for the anthropic principle is evidence that the Earth or the Solar System occupied a privileged position in the universe, in violation of the Copernican principle (for possible counterevidence to this principle, see Copernican principle), unless there was some reason to think that that position was a necessary condition for our existence as observers.

== Applications of the principle ==

=== The nucleosynthesis of carbon-12 ===
Fred Hoyle may have invoked anthropic reasoning to predict an astrophysical phenomenon. He is said to have reasoned, from the prevalence on Earth of life forms whose chemistry was based on carbon-12 nuclei, that there must be an undiscovered resonance in the carbon-12 nucleus facilitating its synthesis in stellar interiors via the triple-alpha process. He then calculated the energy of this undiscovered resonance to be 7.6 million electronvolts. Willie Fowler&#x27;s research group soon found this resonance, and its measured energy was close to Hoyle&#x27;s prediction.

However, in 2010 Helge Kragh argued that Hoyle did not use anthropic reasoning in making his prediction, since he made his prediction in 1953 and anthropic reasoning did not come into prominence until 1980. He called this an &quot;anthropic myth&quot;, saying that Hoyle and others made an after-the-fact connection between carbon and life decades after the discovery of the resonance.

=== Cosmic inflation ===
Don Page criticized the entire theory of cosmic inflation as follows. He emphasized that initial conditions that made possible a thermodynamic arrow of time in a universe with a Big Bang origin, must include the assumption that at the initial singularity, the entropy of the universe was low and therefore extremely improbable. Paul Davies rebutted this criticism by invoking an inflationary version of the anthropic principle. While Davies accepted the premise that the initial state of the visible universe (which filled a microscopic amount of space before inflating) had to possess a very low entropy value—due to random quantum fluctuations—to account for the observed thermodynamic arrow of time, he deemed this fact an advantage for the theory. That the tiny patch of space from which our observable universe grew had to be extremely orderly, to allow the post-inflation universe to have an arrow of time, makes it unnecessary to adopt any &quot;ad hoc&quot; hypotheses about the initial entropy state, hypotheses other Big Bang theories require.

=== String theory ===
String theory predicts a large number of possible universes, called the &quot;backgrounds&quot; or &quot;vacua&quot;. The set of these vacua is often called the &quot;multiverse&quot; or &quot;anthropic landscape&quot; or &quot;string landscape&quot;. Leonard Susskind has argued that the existence of a large number of vacua puts anthropic reasoning on firm ground: only universes whose properties are such as to allow observers to exist are observed, while a possibly much larger set of universes lacking such properties go unnoticed.

Steven Weinberg believes the anthropic principle may be appropriated by cosmologists committed to nontheism, and refers to that principle as a &quot;turning point&quot; in modern science because applying it to the string landscape &quot;may explain how the constants of nature that we observe can take values suitable for life without being fine-tuned by a benevolent creator&quot;. Others—most notably David Gross but also Luboš Motl, Peter Woit, and Lee Smolin—argue that this is not predictive. Max Tegmark, Mario Livio, and Martin Rees argue that only some aspects of a physical theory need be observable and/or testable for the theory to be accepted, and that many well-accepted theories are far from completely testable at present.

Jürgen Schmidhuber (2000–2002) points out that Ray Solomonoff&#x27;s theory of universal inductive inference and its extensions already provide a framework for maximizing our confidence in any theory, given a limited sequence of physical observations, and some prior distribution on the set of possible explanations of the universe.

Zhi-Wei Wang and Samuel L. Braunstein proved that life&#x27;s existence in the universe depends on various fundamental constants. It suggests that without a complete understanding of these constants, one might incorrectly perceive the universe as being intelligently designed for life. This perspective challenges the view that our universe is unique in its ability to support life.

=== Dimensions of spacetime ===
There are two kinds of dimensions: spatial (bidirectional) and temporal (unidirectional). Let the number of spatial dimensions be &quot;N&quot; and the number of temporal dimensions be &quot;T&quot;. That and , setting aside the compactified dimensions invoked by string theory and undetectable to date, can be explained by appealing to the physical consequences of letting &quot;N&quot; differ from 3 and &quot;T&quot; differ from 1. The argument is often of an anthropic character and possibly the first of its kind, albeit before the complete concept came into vogue.

The implicit notion that the dimensionality of the universe is special is first attributed to Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who in the Discourse on Metaphysics suggested that the world is &quot;&quot;. Immanuel Kant argued that 3-dimensional space was a consequence of the inverse square law of universal gravitation. While Kant&#x27;s argument is historically important, John D. Barrow said that it &quot;gets the punch-line back to front: it is the three-dimensionality of space that explains why we see inverse-square force laws in Nature, not vice-versa&quot; (Barrow 2002:204).

In 1920, Paul Ehrenfest showed that if there is only a single time dimension and more than three spatial dimensions, the orbit of a planet about its Sun cannot remain stable. The same is true of a star&#x27;s orbit around the center of its galaxy. Ehrenfest also showed that if there are an even number of spatial dimensions, then the different parts of a wave impulse will travel at different speeds. If there are formula_1 spatial dimensions, where &quot;k&quot; is a positive whole number, then wave impulses become distorted. In 1922, Hermann Weyl claimed that Maxwell&#x27;s theory of electromagnetism can be expressed in terms of an action only for a four-dimensional manifold. Finally, Tangherlini showed in 1963 that when there are more than three spatial dimensions, electron orbitals around nuclei cannot be stable; electrons would either fall into the nucleus or disperse.

Max Tegmark expands on the preceding argument in the following anthropic manner. If &quot;T&quot; differs from 1, the behavior of physical systems could not be predicted reliably from knowledge of the relevant partial differential equations. In such a universe, intelligent life capable of manipulating technology could not emerge. Moreover, if , Tegmark maintains that protons and electrons would be unstable and could decay into particles having greater mass than themselves. (This is not a problem if the particles have a sufficiently low temperature.) Lastly, if , gravitation of any kind becomes problematic, and the universe would probably be too simple to contain observers. For example, when , nerves cannot cross without intersecting. Hence anthropic and other arguments rule out all cases except and , which describes the world around us.

On the other hand, in view of creating black holes from an ideal monatomic gas under its self-gravity, Wei-Xiang Feng showed that -dimensional spacetime is the marginal dimensionality. Moreover, it is the unique dimensionality that can afford a &quot;stable&quot; gas sphere with a &quot;positive&quot; cosmological constant. However, a self-gravitating gas cannot be stably bound if the mass sphere is larger than ~1021 solar masses, due to the small positivity of the cosmological constant observed.

In 2019, James Scargill argued that complex life may be possible with two spatial dimensions. According to Scargill, a purely scalar theory of gravity may enable a local gravitational force, and 2D networks may be sufficient for complex neural networks.

== Metaphysical interpretations ==
Some of the metaphysical disputes and speculations include, for example, attempts to back Pierre Teilhard de Chardin&#x27;s earlier interpretation of the universe as being Christ centered (compare Omega Point), expressing a &quot;creatio evolutiva&quot; instead the elder notion of &quot;creatio continua&quot;. From a strictly secular, humanist perspective, it allows as well to put human beings back in the center, an anthropogenic shift in cosmology. Karl W. Giberson has laconically stated that

William Sims Bainbridge disagreed with de Chardin&#x27;s optimism about a future Omega point at the end of history, arguing that logically, humans are trapped at the Omicron point, in the middle of the Greek alphabet rather than advancing to the end, because the universe does not need to have any characteristics that would support our further technical progress, if the anthropic principle merely requires it to be suitable for our evolution to this point.

=== &quot;The anthropic cosmological principle&quot; ===
A thorough extant study of the anthropic principle is the book &quot;The anthropic cosmological principle&quot; by John D. Barrow, a cosmologist, and Frank J. Tipler, a cosmologist and mathematical physicist. This book sets out in detail the many known anthropic coincidences and constraints, including many found by its authors. While the book is primarily a work of theoretical astrophysics, it also touches on quantum physics, chemistry, and earth science. An entire chapter argues that &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; is, with high probability, the only intelligent species in the Milky Way.

The book begins with an extensive review of many topics in the history of ideas the authors deem relevant to the anthropic principle, because the authors believe that principle has important antecedents in the notions of teleology and intelligent design. They discuss the writings of Fichte, Hegel, Bergson, and Alfred North Whitehead, and the Omega Point cosmology of Teilhard de Chardin. Barrow and Tipler carefully distinguish teleological reasoning from &quot;eutaxiological&quot; reasoning; the former asserts that order must have a consequent purpose; the latter asserts more modestly that order must have a planned cause. They attribute this important but nearly always overlooked distinction to an obscure 1883 book by L. E. Hicks.

Seeing little sense in a principle requiring intelligent life to emerge while remaining indifferent to the possibility of its eventual extinction, Barrow and Tipler propose the final anthropic principle (FAP): Intelligent information-processing must come into existence in the universe, and, once it comes into existence, it will never die out.

Barrow and Tipler submit that the FAP is both a valid physical statement and &quot;closely connected with moral values&quot;. FAP places strong constraints on the structure of the universe, constraints developed further in Tipler&#x27;s &quot;The Physics of Immortality&quot;. One such constraint is that the universe must end in a Big Crunch, which seems unlikely in view of the tentative conclusions drawn since 1998 about dark energy, based on observations of very distant supernovas.

In his review of Barrow and Tipler, Martin Gardner ridiculed the FAP by quoting the last two sentences of their book as defining a completely ridiculous anthropic principle (CRAP):

== Reception and controversies ==
Carter has frequently expressed regret for his own choice of the word &quot;anthropic&quot;, because it conveys the misleading impression that the principle involves &quot;humans in particular&quot;, to the exclusion of non-human intelligence more broadly. Others have criticised the word &quot;principle&quot; as being too grandiose to describe straightforward applications of selection effects.

A common criticism of Carter&#x27;s SAP is that it is an easy &quot;deus ex machina&quot; that discourages searches for physical explanations. To quote Penrose again: &quot;It tends to be invoked by theorists whenever they do not have a good enough theory to explain the observed facts.&quot;

Carter&#x27;s SAP and Barrow and Tipler&#x27;s WAP have been dismissed as truisms or trivial tautologies—that is, statements true solely by virtue of their logical form and not because a substantive claim is made and supported by observation of reality. As such, they are criticized as an elaborate way of saying, &quot;If things were different, they would be different&quot;, which is a valid statement, but does not make a claim of some factual alternative over another.

Critics of the Barrow and Tipler SAP claim that it is neither testable nor falsifiable, and thus is not a scientific statement but rather a philosophical one. The same criticism has been leveled against the hypothesis of a multiverse, although some argue that it does make falsifiable predictions. A modified version of this criticism is that humanity understands so little about the emergence of life, especially intelligent life, that it is effectively impossible to calculate the number of observers in each universe. Also, the prior distribution of universes as a function of the fundamental constants is easily modified to get any desired result.

Many criticisms focus on versions of the strong anthropic principle, such as Barrow and Tipler&#x27;s &quot;anthropic cosmological principle&quot;, which are teleological notions that tend to describe the existence of life as a &quot;necessary prerequisite&quot; for the observable constants of physics. Similarly, Stephen Jay Gould, Michael Shermer, and others claim that the stronger versions of the anthropic principle seem to reverse known causes and effects. Gould compared the claim that the universe is fine-tuned for the benefit of our kind of life to saying that sausages were made long and narrow so that they could fit into modern hotdog buns, or saying that ships had been invented to house barnacles. These critics cite the vast physical, fossil, genetic, and other biological evidence consistent with life having been fine-tuned through natural selection to adapt to the physical and geophysical environment in which life exists. Life appears to have adapted to the universe, and not vice versa.

Some applications of the anthropic principle have been criticized as an argument by lack of imagination, for tacitly assuming that carbon compounds and water are the only possible chemistry of life (sometimes called &quot;carbon chauvinism&quot;; see also alternative biochemistry). The range of fundamental physical constants consistent with the evolution of carbon-based life may also be wider than those who advocate a fine-tuned universe have argued. For instance, Harnik et al. propose a Weakless Universe in which the weak nuclear force is eliminated. They show that this has no significant effect on the other fundamental interactions, provided some adjustments are made in how those interactions work. However, if some of the fine-tuned details of our universe were violated, that would rule out complex structures of any kind—stars, planets, galaxies, etc.

Lee Smolin has offered a theory designed to improve on the lack of imagination that has been ascribed to anthropic principles. He puts forth his fecund universes theory, which assumes universes have &quot;offspring&quot; through the creation of black holes whose offspring universes have values of physical constants that depend on those of the mother universe.

The philosophers of cosmology John Earman, Ernan McMullin, and Jesús Mosterín contend that &quot;in its weak version, the anthropic principle is a mere tautology, which does not allow us to explain anything or to predict anything that we did not already know. In its strong version, it is a gratuitous speculation&quot;. A further criticism by Mosterín concerns the flawed &quot;anthropic&quot; inference from the assumption of an infinity of worlds to the existence of one like ours:

<text>The Australian Army is the principal land warfare force of Australia. It is a part of the Australian Defence Force (ADF), along with the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force. The Army is commanded by the Chief of Army (CA), who is subordinate to the Chief of the Defence Force (CDF) who commands the ADF. The CA is also directly responsible to the Minister for Defence, with the Department of Defence administering the ADF and the Army.

Formed in 1901, as the Commonwealth Military Forces, through the amalgamation of the colonial forces of Australia following the Federation of Australia. Although Australian soldiers have been involved in a number of minor and major conflicts throughout Australia&#x27;s history, only during the Second World War has Australian territory come under direct attack.

The Australian Army was initially composed almost completely of part-time soldiers, where the vast majority were in units of the Citizens Military Force (CMF or Militia) (1901–1980) during peacetime, with limits set on the regular Army. Since all reservists were barred from forcibly serving overseas, volunteer expeditionary forces (1st AIF, ANMEF, 2nd AIF) were formed to enable the Army to send large numbers of soldiers to serve overseas during periods of war. This period lasted from federation until post-1947, when a standing peacetime regular army was formed and the Australian Army Reserve (1980–present) began to decline in importance.

During its history, the Australian Army has fought in a number of major wars, including the Second Boer War, the First and Second World Wars, Korean War, Malayan Emergency, Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation, Vietnam War, the War in Afghanistan (2001–2021) and the Iraq War. Since 1947, the Australian Army has also been involved in many peacekeeping operations, usually under the auspices of the United Nations. Today, it participates in multilateral and unilateral military exercises and provides emergency disaster relief and humanitarian aid in response to domestic and international crises.

==History==
=== Formation ===

Formed in March 1901, following federation, the Australian Army initially consisted of the six, disbanded and separate, colonial military forces&#x27; land components. Due to the Army being continuation of the colonial armies, it became immediately embroiled in conflict as contingents had been committed to fight for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in the Second Boer War. The Army gained command of these contingents and even supplied federal units to reinforce their commitment at the request of the British government.

The &quot;Defence Act 1903,&quot; established the operation and command structure of the Australian Army. In 1911, the Universal Service Scheme was implemented, introducing conscription for the first time in Australia, with males aged 14–26 assigned into cadet and CMF units; though the scheme did not prescribe or allow overseas service outside the states and territories of Australia. This restriction would be primarily, and continually, bypassed through the process of raising separate volunteer forces until the mid-20th century; this solution was not without its drawbacks, as it caused logistical dilemmas.

=== World War I ===

After the declaration of war on the Central Powers, the Australian Army raised the all volunteer First Australian Imperial Force (AIF) which had an initial recruitment of 52,561 out of a promised 20,000 men. A smaller expeditionary force, the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force (ANMEF), dealt with the issue of the German Pacific holdings. ANMEF recruitment began on 10 August 1914, and operations started 10 days later. On 11 September, the ANMEF landed at Rabaul to secure German New Guinea, with no German outposts in the Pacific left by November 1914. During the AIF&#x27;s preparations to depart Australia, the Ottoman Empire joined the Central Powers; thereby receiving declarations of war from the Allies of World War I in early November 1914.

After initial recruitment and training, the AIF departed for Egypt where they underwent further preparations, and where the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) was formed. Their presence in Egypt was due to the planned Gallipoli campaign, an invasion of the Ottoman Empire via Gallipoli. On 25 April, the AIF landed at ANZAC Cove, which signaled the start of Australia&#x27;s contribution to the campaign. Following little initial success, fighting quickly devolved into trench warfare, which precipitated a stalemate. On 15 December 1915, after eight months of fighting, the evacuation of Gallipoli commenced; it was completed 5 days later with no casualties recorded. After regrouping in Egypt, the AIF was split into two groups and further expanded with reinforcements. This division would see a majority of the Australian Light Horse fight the Ottomans in Arabia and the Levant, whereas
the rest of the AIF would go to the Western Front.

==== Western Front ====
The AIF arrived in France with the 1st, 2nd, 4th and 5th Divisions; which comprised, in part, I ANZAC Corps and, in full, II ANZAC Corps. The 3rd Division would not arrive until November 1916, as it underwent training in England after its transfer from Australia. In July 1916, the AIF commenced operations with the Battle of the Somme, and more specifically with the Attack at Fromelles. Soon after, the 1st, 2nd and 4th Divisions became tied down in actions at the Battle of Pozières and Mouquet Farm. In around six weeks, the operations caused 28,000 Australian casualties. Due to these losses and pressure from the United Kingdom to maintain the AIF&#x27;s manpower, Prime Minister Billy Hughes introduced the first conscription plebiscite. It was defeated by a narrow margin and created a bitter divide on the issue of conscription throughout the 20th century.

Following the German withdrawal to the Hindenburg Line in March 1917, which was better defended and eased manpower restraints, the first Australian assault on the Hindenburg Line occurred on 11 April 1917 with the First Battle of Bullecourt. On 20 September, the Australian contingent joined the Third Battle of Ypres with the Battle of Menin Road, and continued on to fight in the Battle of Polygon Wood, which lasted until 3 October; in total, these tow operations cost roughly 11,000 in Australian casualties. Until 15 November 1917, multiple attacks at the Battle of Broodseinde Ridge and the Battle of Passchendaele occurred, but, failed to take their objectives following the start of the rain and subsequent muddying of the fields.

On 21 March 1918, the Germans attempted a breakout through the Michael Offensive, which was part of the much larger German spring offensive; the AIF suffered 15,000 casualties due to this effort. During this operation, Australian troops conducted a series of local defences and offensives to hold and retake Villers–Brettoneux over the period 4 to 25 April 1918. After the cessation of offensives by the German Army, the Australian Corps began participating in &quot;Peaceful penetration&quot; operations, which were localised raids designed to harass and gain small tracts of territory; these proved so effective that several major operational objectives were captured.

On 4 July 1918, the Battle of Hamel saw the first successful use of tanks alongside Australians, with the battleplan of John Monash completed three minutes over the planned 90 minute operation. Following this success, the Battle of Amiens was launched on 8 August 1918, in conjunction with the Canadian Corps and the British III Corps, and concluded on 12 August 1918; General Erich Ludendorff described it as &quot;the black day of the German Army&quot;. On 29 August 1918, following territorial advances and pursuits, the AIF attacked Pèronne and subsequently initiated the Battle of Mont St Quentin. Another operation around Épehy was planned for 18 September 1918, which aimed to retake the British trenches and, potentially, capture their most ambitious objective of the Hindenburg&#x27;s outpost line – which they achieved.

Following news of a three-month furlough for certain soldiers, seven AIF battalions were disbanded; consequently, members of these battalions mutinied. Soon after the penetration of the Hindenburg Line, plans for the breakthrough of the main trench, with the Australian Corps as the vanguard, were completed. However, due to manpower issues, only the 3rd and 5th Divisions participated, with the American Expeditionary Forces&#x27; 27th and 30th Divisions given as reinforcements. On 29 September, following a three day long bombardment, the Battle of the Hindenburg Line commenced, wherein the corps attacked and captured more of the line. On 5 October 1918, after furious fighting, the Australian Corps was withdrawn from the front, as the entire corps had been operating continuously since 8 August 1918. They would not return to the battlefield, as Germany signed the Armistice of 11 November 1918 that ultimately ended the war on the Western Front.

==== Middle East ====
The Australian mounted units, composed of the ANZAC Mounted Division and eventually the Australian Mounted Division, participated in the Sinai and Palestine campaign. They were originally stationed there to protect the Suez Canal from the Turks, and following the threat of its capture passing, they started offensive operations and helped in the re-conquest of the Sinai Desert. This was followed by the Battles of Gaza, wherein on the 31 October 1917 the 4th and 12th Light Horse took Beersheba through the last charge of the Light Horse. They continued on to capture Jerusalem on 10 December 1917 and then eventually Damascus on 1 October 1918 whereby, a few days later on 10 October 1918, the Ottoman Empire surrendered.

=== Interbellum ===

Repatriation efforts were implemented between the armistice and the end of 1919, which occurred after the disbandment of the Australian Imperial Force. In 1921, CMF units were renumbered to that of the AIF, to perpetuate the honours and numerical identities of the units involved in WW1. During this period there was a complacency towards matters of defence, due to the devastating effects of the previous war on the Australian psyche. Following the election of Prime Minister James Scullin in 1929, two events occurred that substantially affected the armed forces: conscription was abolished and the economic effects of the Great Depression started to be felt in Australia. The economic ramifications of the depression led to decisions that decreased defence expenditure and manpower for the army. Since conscription was repealed, to reflect the new volunteer nature of the Citizens Forces, the CMF was renamed to the Militia.

=== World War II ===
Following the declaration of war on Nazi Germany and her allies by the United Kingdom, and the subsequent confirmation by Prime Minister Robert Menzies on 3 September 1939, the Australian Army raised the Second Australian Imperial Force, a 20,000-strong volunteer expeditionary force, which initially consisted of the 6th Division; later increased to include the 7th and 9th Divisions, alongside the 8th Division which was sent to Singapore. In October 1939, compulsory military training recommenced for unmarried men aged 21, who had to complete three months of training.

The 2nd AIF commenced its first operations in North Africa with Operation Compass, that began with the Battle of Bardia. This was followed by supplying Australian units to defend against the Axis in the Battle of Greece. After the evacuation of Greece, Australian troops took part in the Battle of Crete which, though more successful, still failed and another withdrawal was ordered. During the Greek Campaign, the Allies were pushed back to Egypt and the Siege of Tobruk began. Tobruk&#x27;s primary defence personnel were Australians of the 9th Division; the so-called &#x27;Rats of Tobruk&#x27;. Additionally, the AIF participated in the Syria–Lebanon campaign. The 9th Division fought in the First and Second Battle of El Alamein before also being shipped home to fight the Japanese.

==== Pacific ====

In December 1941, following the Bombing of Pearl Harbor, Australia declared war on Japan. Consequently, the AIF was requested to return home, as the subsequent rapid conquest of Southeast Asia extremely concerned Australian policymakers, and the militia was mobilised. After the Fall of Singapore, and the consequent capture of the entire 8th Division as POWs, this concern only grew. These events hastened the relief of the Rats of Tobruk, while the other divisions were immediately recalled to reinforce New Guinea. General conscription was reintroduced, though service was again limited to Australian possessions, which caused tension between the AIF and Militia. This was in addition to the CMF&#x27;s perceived inferior fighting ability, with these grievances earning the Militia their nicknames of &quot;koalas&quot; and &quot;chocos&quot; or &quot;chocolate soldiers&quot;.

The Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s failure in the Battle of the Coral Sea, was the impetus for the Imperial Japanese Army to try to capture Port Moresby via the Owen Stanley Range. On 21 July 1942, the Japanese began the Kokoda Campaign after landing at Gona; attempts to defeat them by Australian battalions were met with eventual success. Resultant offensive operations concluded with the Japanese being driven out of New Guinea entirely. In parallel with these defences, the Battle of Milne Bay was waged, and when the Japanese were repulsed, it was considered their first significant reversal for the war. In November 1942, the campaign ended after the Japanese withdrawal, with Australian advances leading to the Battle of Buna–Gona.

In early 1943, the Salamaua–Lae campaign began, with operations against the entrenched Japanese aimed towards recapturing the eponymous towns. This culminated in the capture of Lae, held by the 7th Division in early September 1943, from a successful combined amphibious landing at Lae and an airborne landing at Nadzab. The seaborne assault was notable as it was the first large–scale amphibious operation since Gallipoli. Subsequently, Salamaua was taken days later on 11 September 1943, by a separate joint Australia–US attack. The Battle of Lae was additionally part of the wider Huon Peninsula campaign. Following Lae&#x27;s capture, the Battle of Finschhafen commenced with a relatively swift control of objectives, with subsequent Japanese counterattacks beaten off. On 17 November 1943, a major offensive that began with the Battle of Sattelberg, continued with the Battle of Wareo, and concluded with the Battle of Sio on 15 January 1944, was unleashed. The momentum of this advance was continued by the 8th Brigade, as they pursued the enemy in retreat, which culminated with the Battle of Madang.

In mid-1944, Australian forces took over the garrisoning of Torokina from the US with this changeover giving Australian command responsibility over the Bougainville campaign. Soon after arriving in November of the same year, the commander of II Corps, Lieutenant-General Stanley Savige, began an offensive to retake the island with the 3rd Division alongside the 11th and 23rd Brigades. The campaign lasted until the Japanese surrender, with controversy surrounding its little apparent significance to the war&#x27;s conclusion, and the number of casualties incurred; this was one of Australia&#x27;s most costliest campaigns in the Second World War.

In October 1944, Australian participation in the Aitape–Wewak campaign began with the replacement of US forces at Aitape with the Australian 6th Division. US forces had previously captured the position, and had held it passively, though Australian command found this unsuitable. On 2 November 1944, the 2/6th Cavalry Commando Regiment was tasked with patrolling the area, wherein minor engagements were reported. In early December, the commandos were sent inland to establish access to the Torricelli Range, while the 19th Brigade handled patrolling, consequently, the amount of fierce fighting and territory secured increased. Following this success, thought was given for the capture of Maprik and Wewak, though supply became a major issue in this period. On 10 February 1945, the campaign&#x27;s major offensive was underway, which resulted in both falling in quick succession on 22 April 1945. Smaller operations to secure the area continued, and all significant actions ceased by July.

The Borneo campaign was a series of three distinct amphibious operations that were undertaken by the 7th and 9th Divisions. The campaign began with the Battle of Tarakan on 1 May 1945, followed six weeks later by the Battle of Labuan, and concluded with the Battle of Balikpapan. The purpose of capturing Tarakan was to establish airfields, and the island was taken seven weeks following the initial amphibious landing. On 10 June 1945, the operation at Labuan commenced, and was tasked to secure resources and a naval base, and would continue until Japan&#x27;s surrender. On 1 July 1945, the Balikpapan engagement commenced, with all its major objectives being acquired by war&#x27;s end; this operation remains the largest amphibious operation undertaken by Australian forces, with 33,000 Australian servicemen participating. On 15 August 1945, Japan surrendered, ending the Second World War.

=== Cold War ===
==== Korean War ====

After the surrender of Japan, Australia provided a contingent to the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) which included the 34th Brigade. The units that composed the brigade would eventually become the nucleus of the regular army, with the battalions and brigade being renumbered to reflect this change. Following the start of the Korean War, the Australian Army committed troops to fight against the North Korean forces; the units came from the Australian contribution to BCOF. The 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3RAR) arrived in Pusan on 28 September 1950. Australian troop numbers would increase and continue to be deployed up until the armistice, with 3RAR being eventually joined by the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (1RAR). For a brief period, between 1951 and 1959, the Menzies Government reinstituted conscription and compulsory military training with the National Service Scheme, which required all males of eighteen years of age to serve for specified period in either the Australian Regular Army (ARA) or CMF.

==== Malayan Emergency ====
The Australian military entered the Malayan Emergency (1948–1960) in October 1955, committing the 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (2RAR) to fight alongside Commonwealth forces. The 2RAR fought against the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA), a communist led guerrilla army whose goal was to turn Malaya into a socialist republic, and whose leaders had previously been trained and funded by Britain to resist the Japanese occupation of Malaya. Australian military operations in Malaya consisted of patrolling actions and guarding infrastructure, though they rarely saw combat as the emergency was nearly over by the time of their deployment. All three original Royal Australian Regiment battalions would complete at least one tour before the end of operations. In August 1963, Australia ended deployments to Malaya, three years after the emergency&#x27;s official end.

==== Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation ====

In 1962, the Borneo Confrontation began, due to Indonesia&#x27;s opposition to the formation of Malaysia. It was an undeclared war that entailed a series of border conflicts between Indonesian-backed forces and British–Malaysian allies. Initial Australian support in the conflict began, and continued throughout, with the training and supply of Malaysian troops; Australian soldiers only saw combat during defensive operations. In January 1965, permission was granted for the deployment of 3RAR, with extensive operations conducted in Sarawak from March until their withdrawal in July 1965. The subsequent deployment of 4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (4RAR), in April 1966, was less intensive, with the battalion withdrawn in August. This is not to mention the efforts of several other corps and units in the conflict.

==== Vietnam War ====

The Australian Army commenced its involvement in the Vietnam War by sending military advisors in 1962, which was then increased by sending in combat troops, specifically 1RAR, on 27 May 1965. Just before the official start of hostilities, the Australian Army was augmented with the reintroduction of conscription, which was based on a &#x27;birthday ballot&#x27; selection process for all registered 20-year-old males. These men were required to register, unless they gave a legitimate reason for their exemption, else they faced penalties. This scheme would prove to be one of the most controversial implementations of conscription in Australia, with large protests against its adoption.

In March 1966, the Australian Army increased its commitment again with the replacement of 1RAR with the 1st Australian Task Force, a force in which all nine battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment would serve. One of the heaviest actions of the war occurred in August 1966, with the Battle of Long Tan, wherein D Company, 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (6RAR) successfully fended off an enemy force, estimated at 2,000 men, for four hours. In 1968, Australian forces defended against the Tet Offensive, a Viet Cong military operation, and repulsed them with few casualties. The contribution of personnel to the war was gradually wound down, starting in late-1970 and ending in 1972; the official declaration of the end of Australia&#x27;s involvement in the war was made on 11 January 1973.

==== Activities in Africa ====
Following the Vietnam War, there was a significant hiatus of operational activity by the Australian Army. In late 1979, in the largest deployment of the decade, the Army committed 151 troops to the Commonwealth Monitoring Force, which monitored the transition of Rhodesia to universal suffrage. A decade later in 1989, Australia deployed 300 army engineer personnel as the Australian contribution to the United Nations Transition Assistance Group in Namibia. The mission helped transition the country to independence from South African control.

=== Recent history (1990–present) ===

==== Peacekeeping ====
Following the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq in August 1990, a coalition of countries sponsored by the United Nations Security Council, of which Australia was a part, gave a deadline for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait of the 15 January 1991. Iraq refused to retreat and thus full conflict and the Gulf War began two days later on 17 January 1991. In January 1993, the Australian Army deployed 26 personnel on an ongoing rotational basis to the Multinational Force and Observers (MFO), as part of a non-United Nations peacekeeping organisation that observes and enforces the peace treaty between Israel and Egypt.

Australia&#x27;s largest peacekeeping deployment began in 1999 with the International Force for East Timor, while other ongoing operations include peacekeeping in the Sinai (as part of MFO), and the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (as part of Operation Paladin since 1956). Humanitarian relief after the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake in Aceh Province, Indonesia, Operation Sumatra Assist, ended on 24 March 2005.

==== Afghanistan and Iraq ====

Following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks, Australia promised troops to any military operations that the US commenced in response to the attacks. Subsequently, the Australian Army committed combat troops to Afghanistan in Operation Slipper. This combat role continued until the end of 2013 when it was replaced by a training contingent operating under Operation Highroad until 2021.

After the Gulf War the UN imposed heavy restrictions on Iraq to stop them producing any Weapon of mass destruction. In the early 21st century, the US accused Iraq of possessing these weapons, and requested that the UN invade the country in response, a motion which Australia supported. The UN denied this motion, however, it did not stop a coalition, that Australia joined, invading the country; thus starting the Iraq War on 19 March 2003.

Between April 2015 and June 2020, the Army deployed a 300-strong element to Iraq, designated as Task Group Taji, as part of Operation Okra. In support of a capacity building mission, Task Group Taji&#x27;s main role was to provide training to Iraqi forces, during which Australian troops have served alongside counterparts from New Zealand.

In 2020 an investigation of allegations of war crimes committed during Australian military operations in Afghanistan was concluded with the release of the Brereton Report. The report identified 25 ADF personnel that were involved directly or indirectly in the murder of 39 civilians and prisoners, with 19 referred to the Australian Federal Police to be criminally investigated. A &#x27;warrior culture&#x27; in the SAS was specifically criticised with investigators &#x27;frustrated by outright deceit by those who knew the truth and, not infrequently, misguided resistance to inquiries and investigations by their superiors&#x27;.

==Organisation==


=== 1st (Australian) Division ===
Beginning 1 July 2023, the division was renamed the 1st Australian Division. The 1st, 3rd and 7th Brigades were placed under the direct control of the division&#x27;s headquarters. This reform aimed to improve the connections between the divisional headquarters and the brigades it commands during deployments.

* 1 Brigade – Light Combat Brigade based in Darwin.
* 3 Brigade – Armoured Combat Brigade based in Townsville.
* 7 Brigade – Motorised Combat Brigade based in Brisbane.
* 10 Brigade – Fires Brigade based in Adelaide.
* 17 Sustainment Brigade – Logistic brigade based in Sydney.Adelaide

=== Forces Command ===
Forces Command controls for administrative purposes all non-combat assets of the Australian Army. Its focus is on unifying all training establishments to create a base for scaling and mobilisation:
* 2 Brigade – Health Brigade based across Australia.
*8 Brigade – training brigade with units around Australia.

Additionally, Forces Command includes the following training and support establishments:
* Army Recruit Training Centre at Kapooka, NSW;
* Royal Military College, Duntroon in the ACT;
* Combined Arms Training Centre at Puckapunyal, Victoria;
* Army Logistic Training Centre at Bonegilla and Bandiana, Victoria;
* Defence Command Support Training Centre at Macleod, Victoria;
* Combat Training Centre at Townsville, Queensland.
* 39th Operational Support Battalion at Sydney, NSW.

=== 2nd (Australian) Division ===
Administers the reserve forces from its headquarters located in Sydney.

* 4 Brigade – based in Victoria and Tasmania.
*5 Brigade – based in New South Wales.
*9 Brigade – based in South Australia.
* 11 Brigade – based in Queensland.
* 13 Brigade – based in Western Australia.

=== Aviation ===
Army Aviation Command is responsible for the Australian Army&#x27;s helicopters and training, aviation safety and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Army Aviation Command comprises:
* 16 Aviation Brigade – brigade based in Gallipoli Barracks at Enoggera, Brisbane.
* Army Aviation Training Centre at Oakey, Queensland

=== Special Forces ===
Special Operations Command is a command formation of equal status to the other commands in the ADF and includes all of Army&#x27;s special forces units. Special Operations Command comprises:
* Special Forces Group - a brigade-level headquarters.

==Colours, standards and guidons==

Infantry, and some other combat units of the Australian Army carry flags called the King&#x27;s Colour and the Regimental Colour, known as &quot;the Colours&quot;. Armoured units carry Standards and Guidons – flags smaller than Colours and traditionally carried by Cavalry, Lancer, Light Horse and Mounted Infantry units. The 1st Armoured Regiment is the only unit in the Australian Army to carry a Standard, in the tradition of heavy armoured units. Artillery units&#x27; guns are considered to be their Colours, and on parade are provided with the same respect. Non-combat units (combat service support corps) do not have Colours, as Colours are battle flags and so are only available to combat units. As a substitute, many have Standards or Banners. Units awarded battle honours have them emblazoned on their Colours, Standards and Guidons. They are a link to the unit&#x27;s past and a memorial to the fallen. Artillery do not have Battle Honours – their single Honour is &quot;Ubique&quot; which means &quot;Everywhere&quot; – although they can receive Honour Titles.

The Army is the guardian of the National Flag and as such, unlike the Royal Australian Air Force, does not have a flag or Colours. The Army, instead, has a banner, known as the Army Banner. To commemorate the centenary of the Army, the Governor General Sir William Deane, presented the Army with a new Banner at a parade in front of the Australian War Memorial on 10 March 2001. The banner was presented to the Regimental Sergeant Major of the Army (RSM-A), Warrant Officer Peter Rosemond.

The Army Banner bears the Australian Coat of Arms on the obverse, with the dates &quot;1901–2001&quot; in gold in the upper hoist. The reverse bears the Rising Sun badge of the Australian Army, flanked by seven campaign honours on small gold-edged scrolls: South Africa, World War I, World War II, Korea, Malaya-Borneo, South Vietnam, and Peacekeeping. The banner is trimmed with gold fringe, has gold and crimson cords and tassels, and is mounted on a pike with the usual British royal crest finial.

==Personnel==

===Strength===
As of June 2022 the Army had 28,387 permanent (regular) members and 20,742 reservists (part-time); all of whom are volunteers. As of June 2022, women made up 15.11% of the Army, with a target set for 18% 2025. Gender based restrictions for frontline combat or training roles were lifted in January 2013. Also as of June 2022, Indigenous Australians made up 3.7% of the Army.

===Rank and insignia===

The ranks of the Australian Army are based on the ranks of the British Army, and carry mostly the same actual insignia. For officers the ranks are identical except for the shoulder title &quot;Australia&quot;. The Non-Commissioned Officer insignia are the same up until Warrant Officer, where they are stylised for Australia (for example, using the Australian, rather than the British coat of arms).
The ranks of the Australian Army are as follows:


=== Uniforms and Dress ===
The Australian Army uniforms are detailed in the Australian Army Dress Manual and are grouped into nine general categories, each ranging from ceremonial dress, to general duties dress, to battle dress (in addition there are a number of special categories specific to uniforms that are only worn when posted to specific locations, like ADFA or RMC-D), these are further divided into individual &#x27;Dress Orders&#x27; denoted by alphabetical suffixes that detail the specific items of clothing, embellishment and accoutrements, i.e. &quot;Dress Order No. 1A - &#x27;Ceremonial Parade Service Dress&#x27;,&quot; Dress Order No. 2G - &#x27;General Duty Office Dress&#x27;, Dress Order No 4C &#x27;Combat Dress (AMCU)&#x27; . The slouch hat or beret are the regular service and general duties hat, while the field hat, or combat helmet is for use in the field while training, on exercise, or on operations. In December 2013 the Chief of Army reversed a previous ban on berets as general duties headwear for all personnel except Special Forces personnel (SASR, CDO Regiments). Australian Multi-cam Camouflage Uniform is the camouflage pattern for Australian Army camouflage uniforms, and was introduced in 2014, replacing the Disruptive Pattern Camouflage Uniform (DPCU), and Disruptive Pattern Desert Uniform (DPDU) for all Australian Army orders of dress.

==Bases==

The Army&#x27;s operational headquarters, Forces Command, is located at Victoria Barracks in Sydney. The Australian Army&#x27;s three regular brigades are based at Robertson Barracks near Darwin, Lavarack Barracks in Townsville, and Gallipoli Barracks in Brisbane. The Deployable Joint Force Headquarters is also located at Gallipoli Barracks.

Other important Army bases include the Army Aviation Centre near Oakey, Queensland, Holsworthy Barracks near Sydney, Lone Pine Barracks in Singleton, New South Wales and Woodside Barracks near Adelaide, South Australia. The SASR is based at Campbell Barracks Swanbourne, a suburb of Perth, Western Australia.

Puckapunyal, north of Melbourne, houses the Australian Army&#x27;s Combined Arms Training Centre, Land Warfare Development Centre, and three of the five principal Combat Arms schools. Further barracks include Steele Barracks in Sydney, Keswick Barracks in Adelaide, and Irwin Barracks at Karrakatta in Perth. Dozens of Australian Army Reserve depots are located across Australia.

==Australian Army Journal==
Since June 1948, the Australian Army has published its own journal titled the &quot;Australian Army Journal&quot;. The journal&#x27;s first editor was Colonel Eustace Keogh, and initially, it was intended to assume the role that the &quot;Army Training Memoranda&quot; had filled during the Second World War, although its focus, purpose, and format has shifted over time. Covering a broad range of topics including essays, book reviews and editorials, with submissions from serving members as well as professional authors, the journal&#x27;s stated goal is to provide &quot;...the primary forum for Army&#x27;s professional discourse... [and]... debate within the Australian Army... [and improve the]... intellectual rigor of that debate by adhering to a strict and demanding standard of quality&quot;. In 1976, the journal was placed on hiatus as the &quot;Defence Force Journal&quot; began publication; however, publishing of the &quot;Australian Army Journal&quot; began again in 1999 and since then the journal has been published largely on a quarterly basis, with only minimal interruptions.

<text>The American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN) is the regional Internet registry for the United States, Canada, and many Caribbean and North Atlantic islands. ARIN manages the distribution of Internet number resources, including IPv4 and IPv6 address space and AS numbers. ARIN opened for business on December 22, 1997 after incorporating on April 18, 1997. ARIN is a nonprofit corporation with headquarters in Chantilly, Virginia, United States.

ARIN is one of five regional Internet registries in the world. Like the other regional Internet registries, ARIN:

*Provides services related to the technical coordination and management of Internet number resources
*Facilitates policy development by its members and stakeholders
*Participates in the international Internet community
*Is a nonprofit, community-based organization
*Is governed by an executive board elected by its membership

==Services==
ARIN provides services related to the technical coordination and management of Internet number resources. The nature of these services is described in ARIN&#x27;s mission statement:

:&quot;Applying the principles of stewardship, ARIN, a nonprofit corporation, allocates Internet Protocol resources; develops consensus-based policies; and facilitates the advancement of the Internet through information and educational outreach.&quot;

These services are grouped in three areas: Registration, Organization, and Policy Development.

===Registration services===
Registration services pertain to the technical coordination and inventory management of Internet number resources. Services include:

*IPv4 address allocation and assignment
*IPv6 address allocation and assignment
*AS number assignment
*Directory services including:
**Registration transaction information (WHOIS)
**Routing information (Internet routing registry)
*DNS (Reverse)

For information on requesting Internet number resources from ARIN, see https://www.arin.net/resources/index.html. This section includes the request templates, specific distribution policies, and guidelines for requesting and managing Internet number resources.

===Organization services===
Organization services pertain to interaction between stakeholders, ARIN members, and ARIN. Services include:

*Elections
*Members meetings
*Information publication and dissemination
*Education and training

===Policy development services===
Policy development services facilitate the development of policy for the technical coordination and management of Internet number resources.

All ARIN policies are set by the community. Everyone is encouraged to participate in the policy development process at public policy meetings and on the Public Policy Mailing List. The ARIN Board of Trustees ratifies policies only after:

#discussion on mailing lists and at meetings;
#ARIN Advisory Council recommendation;
#community consensus in favor of the policy; and
#full legal and fiscal review.

Membership is not required to participate in ARIN&#x27;s policy development process or to apply for Internet number resources.

Services include:

*Maintaining discussion e-mail lists
*Conducting public policy meetings
*Publishing policy documents

==Organizational structure==
ARIN consists of the Internet community within its region, its members, a 7-member Board of Trustees, a 15-member Advisory Council, and a professional staff of about 50. The board of trustees and Advisory Council are elected by ARIN members for three-year terms.

===Board of trustees===
The ARIN membership elects the Board of Trustees (BoT), which has ultimate responsibility for the business affairs and financial health of ARIN, and manages ARIN&#x27;s operations in a manner consistent with the guidance received from the Advisory Council and the goals set by the registry&#x27;s members. The BoT is responsible for determining the disposition of all revenues received to ensure all services are provided in an equitable manner. The BoT ratifies proposals generated from the membership and submitted through the Advisory Council. Executive decisions are carried out following approval by the BoT. The BoT consists of 7 members consisting of a President and CEO, a chairman, a Treasurer, and others.

===Advisory Council===
In addition to the BoT, ARIN has an advisory council that advises ARIN and the BoT on IP address allocation policy and related matters. Adhering to the procedures in the Internet Resource Policy Evaluation Process, the advisory council forwards consensus-based policy proposals to the BoT for ratification. The advisory council consists of 15 elected members consisting of a chair, Vice Chair, and others.

==History==
The organization was formed in December 1997 to &quot;provide IP registration services as an independent, nonprofit corporation.&quot; Until this time, IP address registration (outside of RIPE and APNIC regions) was done in accordance with policies set by the IETF by Network Solutions corporation as part of the InterNIC project. The National Science Foundation approved the plan for the creation of the not-for-profit organization to &quot;give the users of IP numbers (mostly Internet service providers, corporations and other large institutions) a voice in the policies by which they are managed and allocated within the North American region.&quot;. As part of the transition, Network Solutions corporation transitioned these tasks as well as initial staff and computer infrastructure to ARIN.

The initial Board of Trustees consisted of Scott Bradner, John Curran, Kim Hubbard, Don Telage, Randy Bush, Raymundo Vega Aguilar, and Jon Postel (IANA) as an ex-officio member.

The first president of ARIN was Kim Hubbard, from 1997 until 2000. Kim was succeeded by Raymond &quot;Ray&quot; Plzak until the end of 2008. Trustee John Curran was acting president until July 1, 2009, when he assumed the CEO role permanently.

Until late 2002 it served Mexico, Central America, South America and all of the Caribbean. LACNIC now handles parts of the Caribbean, Mexico, Central America, and South America. Also, Sub-Saharan Africa was part of its region until April 2005, when AfriNIC was officially recognized by ICANN as the fifth regional Internet registry.

On 24 September 2015 ARIN has declared exhaustion of the ARIN IPv4 addresses pool.

In 2022, ARIN changed its membership structure to allow end user customers to be considered service members, and in 2024 ARIN updated its membership structure to that ASN-only customers are treated as service members as well, while allowing any of these customers to participate in ARIN governance by requesting General Membership. As a result, all organizations with Internet number resources under an ARIN agreement can participate in ARIN&#x27;s governance.

==Service region==
The countries in the ARIN service region are:

===Former service regions===
ARIN formerly covered Angola, Botswana, Burundi, Republic of Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe until AfriNIC was formed.

ARIN formerly covered Argentina, Aruba, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Dutch West Indies, Ecuador, El Salvador, Falkland Islands (UK), French Guiana, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay, and Venezuela until LACNIC was formed.

<doc id="2802" wikidata="Q418096" url="?curid=2802" title="Akihabara">
<text>is a neighborhood in the Chiyoda ward of Tokyo, Japan, generally considered to be the area surrounding Akihabara Station (nicknamed &quot;Akihabara Electric Town&quot;). This area is part of the and Kanda-Sakumachō districts of Chiyoda. There is an administrative district called Akihabara (part of Taitō ward), located north of Akihabara Electric Town surrounding Akihabara Neribei Park.

The name Akihabara is a shortening of , which comes from , named after a fire-controlling deity of a firefighting shrine built after the area was destroyed by a fire in 1869. Akihabara gained the nickname shortly after World War II for being a major shopping center for household electronic goods and the post-war black market.

Akihabara is considered by many to be the centre of Japanese &quot;otaku&quot; culture, and is a major shopping district for video games, anime, manga, electronics and computer-related goods. Icons from popular anime and manga are displayed prominently on the shops in the area, and numerous maid cafés and some arcades are found throughout the district.

==Geography==
The main area of Akihabara is located on a street just west of Akihabara Station. There is an administrative district called Akihabara north of Akihabara Electric Town surrounding Akihabara Neribei Park. This district is part of Taitō ward.

==History==

Akihabara was once near a city gate of Edo and served as a passage between the city and northwestern Japan. This made the region a home to many craftsmen and tradesmen, as well as some low-class samurai. One of Tokyo&#x27;s frequent fires destroyed the area in 1869, and the people decided to replace the buildings of the area with a shrine called Chinkasha (now known as Akiba Shrine , ), in an attempt to prevent the spread of future fires. The locals nicknamed the shrine Akiba after the deity that could control fire, and the area around it became known as Akibagahara, later Akihabara. After Akihabara Station was built in 1888, the shrine was moved to the Taitō ward, where it resides today.

Since its opening in 1890, Akihabara Station became a major freight transit point, which allowed a vegetable and fruit market to spring up. In the 1920s, the station saw a large volume of passengers after opening for public transport. After World War II, the black market thrived in the absence of a strong government. This disconnection of Akihabara from government authority allowed the district to grow as a market city. In the 1930s, this climate turned Akihabara into a market region specializing in household electronics, such as washing machines, refrigerators, televisions, and stereos, earning Akihabara the nickname &quot;Electric Town&quot;.

As household electronics began to lose their futuristic appeal in the 1980s, the shops of Akihabara shifted their focus to home computers, at a time when they were only used by specialists and hobbyists. This brought in a new type of consumer, computer nerds or &quot;otaku&quot;. The market in Akihabara latched onto their new customer base that was focused on anime, manga, and video games. The connection between Akihabara and &quot;otaku&quot; has grown to the point that the region is a center for &quot;otaku&quot; culture.

==&quot;Otaku&quot; culture==

The streets of Akihabara are covered with anime and manga icons, and cosplayers line the sidewalks handing out advertisements, especially for maid cafés. Release events, special events, and conventions are common in Akihabara. Architects design the stores of Akihabara to be opaque and closed, to reflect the desire of many &quot;otaku&quot; to live in their anime worlds rather than display their interests.

Akihabara&#x27;s role as a free market has allowed a large amount of amateur work to find an audience. &quot;Doujinshi&quot; (amateur or fanmade manga) has been growing in Akihabara since the 1970s.

<doc id="2807" wikidata="Q55692" url="?curid=2807" title="Active Directory">
<text>Active Directory (AD) is a directory service developed by Microsoft for Windows domain networks. Windows Server operating systems include it as a set of processes and services. Originally, only centralized domain management used Active Directory. However, it ultimately became an umbrella title for various directory-based identity-related services.

A domain controller is a server running the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) role. It authenticates and authorizes all users and computers in a Windows domain-type network, assigning and enforcing security policies for all computers and installing or updating software. For example, when a user logs into a computer which is part of a Windows domain, Active Directory checks the submitted username and password and determines whether the user is a system administrator or a non-admin user. Furthermore, it allows the management and storage of information, provides authentication and authorization mechanisms, and establishes a framework to deploy other related services: Certificate Services, Active Directory Federation Services, Lightweight Directory Services, and Rights Management Services.

Active Directory uses Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) versions 2 and 3, Microsoft&#x27;s version of Kerberos, and DNS.

Robert R. King defined it in the following way:

==History==
Like many information-technology efforts, Active Directory originated out of a democratization of design using Requests for Comments (RFCs). The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) oversees the RFC process and has accepted numerous RFCs initiated by widespread participants. For example, LDAP underpins Active Directory. Also, X.500 directories and the Organizational Unit preceded the Active Directory concept that uses those methods. The LDAP concept began to emerge even before the founding of Microsoft in April 1975, with RFCs as early as 1971. RFCs contributing to LDAP include RFC 1823 (on the LDAP API, August 1995), RFC 2307, RFC 3062, and RFC 4533.

Microsoft previewed Active Directory in 1999, released it first with Windows 2000 Server edition, and revised it to extend functionality and improve administration in Windows Server 2003. Active Directory support was also added to Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT 4.0 via patch, with some unsupported features. Additional improvements came with subsequent versions of Windows Server. In Windows Server 2008, Microsoft added further services to Active Directory, such as Active Directory Federation Services. The part of the directory in charge of managing domains, which was a core part of the operating system, was renamed Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS) and became a server role like others. &quot;Active Directory&quot; became the umbrella title of a broader range of directory-based services. According to Byron Hynes, everything related to identity was brought under Active Directory&#x27;s banner.

==Active Directory Services==
Active Directory Services consist of multiple directory services. The best known is Active Directory Domain Services, commonly abbreviated as AD DS or simply AD.

===Domain Services===
Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) is the foundation of every Windows domain network. It stores information about domain members, including devices and users, verifies their credentials, and defines their access rights. The server running this service is called a domain controller. A domain controller is contacted when a user logs into a device, accesses another device across the network, or runs a line-of-business Metro-style app sideloaded into a machine.

Other Active Directory services (excluding LDS, as described below) and most Microsoft server technologies rely on or use Domain Services; examples include Group Policy, Encrypting File System, BitLocker, Domain Name Services, Remote Desktop Services, Exchange Server, and SharePoint Server.

The self-managed Active Directory DS must be distinct from managed Azure AD DS, a cloud product.

=== Lightweight Directory Services===
Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS), previously called &quot;Active Directory Application Mode&quot; (ADAM), implements the LDAP protocol for AD DS. It runs as a service on Windows Server and offers the same functionality as AD DS, including an equal API. However, AD LDS does not require the creation of domains or domain controllers. It provides a Data Store for storing directory data and a &quot;Directory Service&quot; with an LDAP Directory Service Interface. Unlike AD DS, multiple AD LDS instances can operate on the same server.

===Certificate Services===
Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) establishes an on-premises public key infrastructure. It can create, validate, revoke and perform other similar actions, public key certificates for internal uses of an organization. These certificates can be used to encrypt files (when used with Encrypting File System), emails (per S/MIME standard), and network traffic (when used by virtual private networks, Transport Layer Security protocol or IPSec protocol).

AD CS predates Windows Server 2008, but its name was simply Certificate Services.

AD CS requires an AD DS infrastructure.

===Federation Services===

Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) is a single sign-on service. With an AD FS infrastructure in place, users may use several web-based services (e.g. internet forum, blog, online shopping, webmail) or network resources using only one set of credentials stored at a central location, as opposed to having to be granted a dedicated set of credentials for each service. AD FS uses many popular open standards to pass token credentials such as SAML, OAuth or OpenID Connect. AD FS supports encryption and signing of SAML assertions. AD FS&#x27;s purpose is an extension of that of AD DS: The latter enables users to authenticate with and use the devices that are part of the same network, using one set of credentials. The former enables them to use the same set of credentials in a different network.

As the name suggests, AD FS works based on the concept of federated identity.

AD FS requires an AD DS infrastructure, although its federation partner may not.

===Rights Management Services===

Active Directory Rights Management Services (AD RMS), previously known as Rights Management Services or RMS before Windows Server 2008, is server software that allows for information rights management, included with Windows Server. It uses encryption and selective denial to restrict access to various documents, such as corporate e-mails, Microsoft Word documents, and web pages. It also limits the operations authorized users can perform on them, such as viewing, editing, copying, saving, or printing. IT administrators can create pre-set templates for end users for convenience, but end users can still define who can access the content and what actions they can take.

==Logical structure==
Active Directory is a service comprising a database and executable code. It is responsible for managing requests and maintaining the database. The Directory System Agent is the executable part, a set of Windows services and processes that run on Windows 2000 and later. Accessing the objects in Active Directory databases is possible through various interfaces such as LDAP, ADSI, messaging API, and Security Accounts Manager services.

===Objects used===
Active Directory structures consist of information about objects classified into two categories: resources (such as printers) and security principals (which include user or computer accounts and groups). Each security principal is assigned a unique security identifier (SID). An object represents a single entity, such as a user, computer, printer, or group, along with its attributes. Some objects may even contain other objects within them. Each object has a unique name, and its definition is a set of characteristics and information by a schema, which determines the storage in the Active Directory.

Administrators can extend or modify the schema using the schema object when needed. However, because each schema object is integral to the definition of Active Directory objects, deactivating or changing them can fundamentally alter or disrupt a deployment. Modifying the schema affects the entire system automatically, and new objects cannot be deleted, only deactivated. Changing the schema usually requires planning.

===Forests, trees, and domains===
In an Active Directory network, the framework that holds objects has different levels: the forest, tree, and domain. Domains within a deployment contain objects stored in a single replicable database, and the DNS name structure identifies their domains, the namespace. A domain is a logical group of network objects such as computers, users, and devices that share the same Active Directory database.

On the other hand, a tree is a collection of domains and domain trees in a contiguous namespace linked in a transitive trust hierarchy. The forest is at the top of the structure, a collection of trees with a standard global catalog, directory schema, logical structure, and directory configuration. The forest is a secure boundary that limits access to users, computers, groups, and other objects.

====Organizational units====
The objects held within a domain can be grouped into organizational units (OUs). OUs can provide hierarchy to a domain, ease its administration, and can resemble the organization&#x27;s structure in managerial or geographical terms. OUs can contain other OUs—domains are containers in this sense. Microsoft recommends using OUs rather than domains for structure and simplifying the implementation of policies and administration. The OU is the recommended level at which to apply group policies, which are Active Directory objects formally named group policy objects (GPOs), although policies can also be applied to domains or sites (see below). The OU is the level at which administrative powers are commonly delegated, but delegation can be performed on individual objects or attributes as well.

Organizational units do not each have a separate namespace. As a consequence, for compatibility with Legacy NetBios implementations, user accounts with an identical SamAccountName are not allowed within the same domain even if the accounts objects are in separate OUs. This is because SamAccountName, a user object attribute, must be unique within the domain. However, two users in different OUs can have the same common name (CN), the name under which they are stored in the directory itself such as &quot;fred.staff-ou.domain&quot; and &quot;fred.student-ou.domain&quot;, where &quot;staff-ou&quot; and &quot;student-ou&quot; are the OUs.

In general, the reason for this lack of allowance for duplicate names through hierarchical directory placement is that Microsoft primarily relies on the principles of NetBIOS, which is a flat-namespace method of network object management that, for Microsoft software, goes all the way back to Windows NT 3.1 and MS-DOS LAN Manager. Allowing for duplication of object names in the directory, or completely removing the use of NetBIOS names, would prevent backward compatibility with legacy software and equipment. However, disallowing duplicate object names in this way is a violation of the LDAP RFCs on which Active Directory is supposedly based.

As the number of users in a domain increases, conventions such as &quot;first initial, middle initial, last name&quot; (Western order) or the reverse (Eastern order) fail for common family names like &quot;Li&quot; (李), &quot;Smith&quot; or &quot;Garcia&quot;. Workarounds include adding a digit to the end of the username. Alternatives include creating a separate ID system of unique employee/student ID numbers to use as account names in place of actual users&#x27; names and allowing users to nominate their preferred word sequence within an acceptable use policy.

Because duplicate usernames cannot exist within a domain, account name generation poses a significant challenge for large organizations that cannot be easily subdivided into separate domains, such as students in a public school system or university who must be able to use any computer across the network.

=====Shadow groups=====

In Microsoft&#x27;s Active Directory, OUs do not confer access permissions, and objects placed within OUs are not automatically assigned access privileges based on their containing OU. It represents a design limitation specific to Active Directory, and other competing directories, such as Novell NDS, can set access privileges through object placement within an OU.

Active Directory requires a separate step for an administrator to assign an object in an OU as a group member also within that OU. Using only the OU location to determine access permissions is unreliable since the entity might not have been assigned to the group object for that OU yet.

A common workaround for an Active Directory administrator is to write a custom PowerShell or Visual Basic script to automatically create and maintain a &quot;user group&quot; for each OU in their Directory. The scripts run periodically to update the group to match the OU&#x27;s account membership. However, they cannot instantly update the security groups anytime the directory changes, as occurs in competing directories, as security is directly implemented into the Directory. Such groups are known as &quot;shadow groups&quot;. Once created, these shadow groups are selectable in place of the OU in the administrative tools. Microsoft&#x27;s Server 2008 reference documentation mentions shadow groups but does not provide instructions on creating them. Additionally, there are no available server methods or console snap-ins for managing these groups.

An organization must determine the structure of its information infrastructure by dividing it into one or more domains and top-level OUs. This decision is critical and can base on various models such as business units, geographical locations, IT service, object type, or a combination of these models. The immediate purpose of organizing OUs is to simplify administrative delegation and, secondarily, to apply group policies. While OUs serve as an administrative boundary, the forest itself is the only security boundary. All other domains must trust any administrator in the forest to maintain security.

===Partitions===
The Active Directory database is organized in &quot;partitions&quot;, each holding specific object types and following a particular replication pattern. Microsoft often refers to these partitions as &#x27;naming contexts. The &#x27;Schema&#x27; partition defines object classes and attributes within the forest. The &#x27;Configuration&#x27; partition contains information on the physical structure and configuration of the forest (such as the site topology). Both replicate all domains in the forest. The &#x27;Domain&#x27; partition holds all objects created in that domain and replicates only within it.

==Physical structure==
&quot;Sites&quot; are physical (rather than logical) groupings defined by one or more IP subnets. AD also defines connections, distinguishing low-speed (e.g., WAN, VPN) from high-speed (e.g., LAN) links. Site definitions are independent of the domain and OU structure and are shared across the forest. Sites play a crucial role in managing network traffic created by replication and directing clients to their nearest domain controllers (DCs). Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 uses the site topology for mail routing. Administrators can also define policies at the site level.

The Active Directory information is physically held on one or more peer domain controllers, replacing the NT PDC/BDC model. Each DC has a copy of the Active Directory. Member servers joined to Active Directory that are not domain controllers are called Member Servers. In the domain partition, a group of objects acts as copies of domain controllers set up as global catalogs. These global catalog servers offer a comprehensive list of all objects in the forest.

Global Catalog servers replicate all objects from all domains to themselves, providing an international listing of entities in the forest. However, to minimize replication traffic and keep the GC&#x27;s database small, only selected attributes of each object are replicated, called the &quot;partial attribute set&quot; (PAS). The PAS can be modified by modifying the schema and marking features for replication to the GC. Earlier versions of Windows used NetBIOS to communicate. Active Directory is fully integrated with DNS and requires TCP/IP—DNS. To fully operate, the DNS server must support SRV resource records, also known as service records.

===Replication===
Active Directory uses multi-master replication to synchronize changes, meaning replicas pull changes from the server where the change occurred rather than being pushed to them. The Knowledge Consistency Checker (KCC) uses defined sites to manage traffic and create a replication topology of site links. Intra-site replication occurs frequently and automatically due to change notifications, which prompt peers to begin a pull replication cycle. Replication intervals between different sites are usually less consistent and don&#x27;t usually use change notifications. However, it&#x27;s possible to set it up to be the same as replication between locations on the same network if needed.

Each DS3, T1, and ISDN link can have a cost, and the KCC alters the site link topology accordingly. Replication may occur transitively through several site links on same-protocol &quot;site link bridges&quot; if the price is low. However, KCC automatically costs a direct site-to-site link lower than transitive connections. A bridgehead server in each zone can send updates to other DCs in the exact location to replicate changes between sites. To configure replication for Active Directory zones, activate DNS in the domain based on the site.

To replicate Active Directory, Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) over IP (RPC/IP) are used. SMTP is used to replicate between sites but only for modifications in the Schema, Configuration, or Partial Attribute Set (Global Catalog) GCs. It&#x27;s not suitable for reproducing the default Domain partition.

==Implementation==
Generally, a network utilizing Active Directory has more than one licensed Windows server computer. Backup and restore of Active Directory are possible for a network with a single domain controller. However, Microsoft recommends more than one domain controller to provide automatic failover protection of the directory. Domain controllers are ideally single-purpose for directory operations only and should not run any other software or role.

Since certain Microsoft products, like SQL Server and Exchange, can interfere with the operation of a domain controller, isolation of these products on additional Windows servers is advised. Combining them can complicate the configuration and troubleshooting of the domain controller or the other installed software more complex. If planning to implement Active Directory, a business should purchase multiple Windows server licenses to have at least two separate domain controllers. Administrators should consider additional domain controllers for performance or redundancy and individual servers for tasks like file storage, Exchange, and SQL Server since this will guarantee that all server roles are adequately supported.

One way to lower the physical hardware costs is by using virtualization. However, for proper failover protection, Microsoft recommends not running multiple virtualized domain controllers on the same physical hardware.

==Database==
The Active-Directory database, the &quot;directory store&quot;, in Windows 2000 Server uses the JET Blue-based Extensible Storage Engine (ESE98). Each domain controller&#x27;s database is limited to 16 terabytes and 2 billion objects (but only 1 billion security principals). Microsoft has created NTDS databases with more than 2 billion objects. NT4&#x27;s Security Account Manager could support up to 40,000 objects. It has two main tables: the &quot;data table&quot; and the &quot;link table&quot;. Windows Server 2003 added a third main table for security descriptor single instancing.

Programs may access the features of Active Directory via the COM interfaces provided by &quot;Active Directory Service Interfaces&quot;.

==Trusting==
To allow users in one domain to access resources in another, Active Directory uses trusts.

Trusts inside a forest are automatically created when domains are created. The forest sets the default boundaries of trust, and implicit, transitive trust is automatic for all domains within a forest.

===Terminology===
;One-way trust
:One domain allows access to users on another domain, but the other domain does not allow access to users on the first domain.
;Two-way trust
:Two domains allow access to users on both domains.
;Trusted domain
:The domain that is trusted; whose users have access to the trusting domain.
;Transitive trust
:A trust that can extend beyond two domains to other trusted domains in the forest.
;Intransitive trust
:A one way trust that does not extend beyond two domains.
;Explicit trust
:A trust that an admin creates. It is not transitive and is one way only.
;Cross-link trust
:An explicit trust between domains in different trees or the same tree when a descendant/ancestor (child/parent) relationship does not exist between the two domains.
;Shortcut
:Joins two domains in different trees, transitive, one- or two-way.
;Forest trust
:Applies to the entire forest. Transitive, one- or two-way.
;Realm
:Can be transitive or nontransitive (intransitive), one- or two-way.
;External
:Connect to other forests or non-Active Directory domains. Nontransitive, one- or two-way.
;PAM trust
:A one-way trust used by Microsoft Identity Manager from a (possibly low-level) production forest to a (Windows Server 2016 functionality level) &#x27;bastion&#x27; forest, which issues time-limited group memberships.

==Management tools==
Microsoft Active Directory management tools include:
*Active Directory Administrative Center (Introduced with Windows Server 2012 and above),
*Active Directory Users and Computers, 
*Active Directory Domains and Trusts, 
*Active Directory Sites and Services, 
*ADSI Edit, 
*Local Users and Groups,
*Active Directory Schema snap-ins for Microsoft Management Console (MMC),
*SysInternals ADExplorer.

These management tools may not provide enough functionality for efficient workflow in large environments. Some third-party tools extend the administration and management capabilities. They provide essential features for a more convenient administration process, such as automation, reports, integration with other services, etc.

==Unix integration==
Varying levels of interoperability with Active Directory can be achieved on most Unix-like operating systems (including Unix, Linux, Mac OS X or Java and Unix-based programs) through standards-compliant LDAP clients, but these systems usually do not interpret many attributes associated with Windows components, such as Group Policy and support for one-way trusts.

Third parties offer Active Directory integration for Unix-like platforms, including:
* &quot;PowerBroker Identity Services&quot;, formerly &quot;Likewise&quot; (BeyondTrust, formerly Likewise Software) – Allows a non-Windows client to join Active Directory
* &quot;ADmitMac&quot; (Thursby Software Systems)
* &quot;Samba&quot; (free software under GPLv3) – Can act as a fully functional Active Directory

The schema additions shipped with Windows Server 2003 R2 include attributes that map closely enough to RFC 2307 to be generally usable. The reference implementation of RFC 2307, nss_ldap and pam_ldap provided by PADL.com, support these attributes directly. The default schema for group membership complies with RFC 2307bis (proposed). Windows Server 2003 R2 includes a Microsoft Management Console snap-in that creates and edits the attributes.

An alternative option is to use another directory service as non-Windows clients authenticate to this while Windows Clients authenticate to Active Directory. Non-Windows clients include 389 Directory Server (formerly Fedora Directory Server, FDS), ViewDS v7.2 XML Enabled Directory, and Sun Microsystems Sun Java System Directory Server. The latter two are both able to perform two-way synchronization with Active Directory and thus provide a &quot;deflected&quot; integration.

Another option is to use OpenLDAP with its &quot;translucent&quot; overlay, which can extend entries in any remote LDAP server with additional attributes stored in a local database. Clients pointed at the local database see entries containing both the remote and local attributes, while the remote database remains completely untouched.

Administration (querying, modifying, and monitoring) of Active Directory can be achieved via many scripting languages, including PowerShell, VBScript, JScript/JavaScript, Perl, Python, and Ruby. Free and non-free Active Directory administration tools can help to simplify and possibly automate Active Directory management tasks.

Since October 2017 Amazon AWS offers integration with Microsoft Active Directory.

<doc id="2810" wikidata="Q252763" url="?curid=2810" title="Aldona of Lithuania">
<text>Aldona (baptized &quot;Ona&quot; or &quot;Anna&quot;; her pagan name, Aldona, is known only from the writings of Maciej Stryjkowski; – 26 May 1339) was Queen consort of Poland (1333–1339), and a princess of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. She was the daughter of Gediminas, Grand Duke of Lithuania.

==Biography==
Aldona married Casimir III of Poland, when he was 15 or 16 years old. The bride was probably of about the same age. The marriage took place on 30 April or 16 October 1325 and was a purely political maneuver to strengthen the first Polish–Lithuanian coalition against the Teutonic Knights. Casimir was seeking allies in the dispute over Pomerania with the Order. Gediminas had just undertaken an unsuccessful attempt to Christianize Lithuania. This coalition was a prelude to the Union of Krewo in 1385, and the Union of Lublin in 1569, which resulted in the creation of a new state, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The details of the agreement are not known; however, it is known that Gediminas released all Polish captives, some 25,000 people, who returned to Poland. The importance of the marriage was attested by the fact that Władysław abandoned his earlier plans to marry his son to Jutta of Bohemia. The alliance was put into effect when joint Polish–Lithuanian forces organized an attack against the Margraviate of Brandenburg in 1326. However, the coalition was not strong and collapsed c. 1330. Yet, there is no evidence of fighting between Poland and Lithuania while Aldona was alive. Aldona died suddenly at the end of May 1339, and was buried in Kraków.

Aldona was remembered for her piety and devotion to music. She was accompanied by court musicians wherever she went. It was even suggested by Jan Długosz that the cymbals which were played in procession before her represented a pagan Lithuanian tradition. Her husband Casimir is known for his romantic affairs: after Aldona&#x27;s death he married three more times.

==Issue==
Aldona had two daughters:
* Cunigunde of Poland (died in 1357); married on 1 January 1345 Louis VI the Roman, the son of Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor.
* Elisabeth (1326–1361); married Bogislaus V, Duke of Pomerania. Elisabeth&#x27;s daughter, Elizabeth of Pomerania, was the fourth wife of Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor.

== In popular culture ==

=== Film ===
Queen Aldona Anna is one of the main characters in the first season of Polish historical TV drama series &quot;Korona Królów&quot; (&quot;The Crown of the Kings&quot;). She is played by Marta Bryła.

<text>Aron Nimzowitsch (; , &quot;Aron Isayevich Nimtsovich&quot;; 7 November 1886 – 16 March 1935) was a Latvian-born Danish chess player and writer. In the late 1920s, Nimzowitsch was one of the best chess players in the world. He was the foremost figure amongst the hypermoderns and wrote a very influential book on chess theory: &quot;My System&quot; (1925–1927). Nimzowitsch&#x27;s seminal work &quot;Chess Praxis&quot;, originally published in German in 1929, was purchased by a pre-teen and future World Champion Tigran Petrosian and was to have a great influence on his development as a chess player.

== Life ==
Born in Riga, then part of the Russian Empire, the Jewish Yiddish-speaking Nimzowitsch came from a wealthy family, where he learned chess from his father Shaya Abramovich Nimzowitsch (1860, Pinsk – 1918), who was a timber merchant. By 1897, the family lived in Dvinsk. Mother&#x27;s name: Esphir Nohumovna Nimzowitsch (born Rabinovich, 1865, Polotsk – 1937), sister – Tsilya-Kreyna Pevzner, brothers Yakov, Osey and Benno. In 1904, he travelled to Berlin to study philosophy, but set aside his studies soon and began a career as a professional chess player that same year. He won his first international tournament at Munich 1906. Then, he tied for first with Alexander Alekhine at Saint Petersburg 1913/14 (the eighth All-Russian Masters&#x27; Tournament).

During the 1917 Russian Revolution, Nimzowitsch was in the Baltic war zone. He escaped being drafted into one of the armies by feigning madness, insisting that a fly was on his head. He then escaped to Berlin, and gave his first name as Arnold, possibly to avoid anti-Semitic persecution.

Nimzowitsch eventually moved to Copenhagen in 1922, where he lived for the rest of his life in one small rented room. In Copenhagen, he won the Nordic Championship twice, in 1924 and in 1934. He obtained Danish citizenship and lived in Denmark until his death in 1935.

== Chess career ==
The height of Nimzowitsch&#x27;s career was the late 1920s and early 1930s. Chessmetrics places him as the third best player in the world from 1927 to 1931, behind Alexander Alekhine and José Capablanca. His most notable successes were first-place finishes at Copenhagen 1923, Marienbad 1925, Dresden 1926, Hanover 1926, the Carlsbad 1929 chess tournament, and second place behind Alekhine at the San Remo 1930 chess tournament. Nimzowitsch never developed a knack for match play, though; his best match success was a draw with Alekhine, but the match consisted of only two games and took place in 1914, thirteen years before Alekhine became world champion.

Nimzowitsch never beat Capablanca (+0−5=6), but fared better against Alekhine (+3−9=9). He even beat Alekhine with the black pieces, in their short 1914 match at St. Petersburg. One of Nimzowitsch&#x27;s most famous games is his celebrated immortal zugzwang game against Sämisch at Copenhagen 1923. Another game on this theme is his win over Paul Johner at Dresden 1926. When in form, Nimzowitsch was very dangerous with the black pieces, scoring many fine wins over top players.

== Legacy ==

Nimzowitsch is considered one of the most important players and writers in chess history. His works influenced numerous other players, including Savielly Tartakower, Milan Vidmar, Richard Réti, Akiba Rubinstein, Mikhail Botvinnik, Bent Larsen, Viktor Korchnoi and Tigran Petrosian, and his influence is still felt today.

He wrote three books on chess strategy: &quot;Mein System (My System)&quot;, 1925; &quot;Die Praxis meines Systems (The Practice of My System)&quot;, 1929, commonly known as &quot;Chess Praxis&quot;; and &quot;Die Blockade&quot; (&quot;The Blockade&quot;), 1925, although much in this book is generally held to be a rehash of material already presented in &quot;Mein System&quot;. &quot;Mein System&quot; is considered to be one of the most influential chess books of all time. It sets out Nimzowitsch&#x27;s most important ideas, while his second most influential work, &quot;Chess Praxis&quot;, elaborates upon these ideas, adds a few new ones, and has immense value as a stimulating collection of Nimzowitsch&#x27;s own games accompanied by his idiosyncratic, hyperbolic commentary which is often as entertaining as instructive.

Nimzowitsch&#x27;s chess theories, when first propounded, flew in the face of widely held orthodoxies enunciated by the dominant theorist of the era, Siegbert Tarrasch, and his disciples. Tarrasch&#x27;s rigid generalizations drew on the earlier work of Wilhelm Steinitz, and were upheld by Tarrasch&#x27;s sharp tongue when dismissing the opinions of doubters. While the greatest players of the time, among them Alekhine, Emanuel Lasker and Capablanca, clearly did not allow their play to be hobbled by blind adherence to general concepts that the center had to be controlled by pawns, that development had to happen in support of this control, that rooks always belong on open files, that wing openings were unsound—core ideas of Tarrasch&#x27;s chess philosophy as popularly understood—beginners were taught to think of these generalizations as unalterable principles.

Nimzowitsch supplemented many of the earlier simplistic assumptions about chess strategy by enunciating in his turn a further number of general concepts of defensive play aimed at achieving one&#x27;s own goals by preventing realization of the opponent&#x27;s plans. Notable in his &quot;system&quot; were concepts such as overprotection of pieces and pawns under attack, control of the center by pieces instead of pawns, blockading of opposing pieces (notably the passed pawns) and prophylaxis. His aforementioned game versus Paul Johner in 1926 (listed in the notable games below) is a great example of Nimzowitsch&#x27;s concept of &#x27;first restrain, then blockade and finally destroy&#x27;. He manoeuvres the black queen from its starting point to h7 to form a part of king-side blockade along with the knight on f6 and h-pawn to stop any attacking threats from White. He was also a leading exponent of the fianchetto development of bishops. Perhaps most importantly, he formulated the terminology still in use for various complex chess strategies. Others had used these ideas in practice, but he was the first to present them systematically as a lexicon of themes accompanied by extensive taxonomical observations.

Raymond Keene writes that Nimzowitsch &quot;was one of the world&#x27;s leading grandmasters for a period extending over a quarter of a century, and for some of that time he was the obvious challenger for the world championship. ... [He was also] a great and profound chess thinker second only to Steinitz, and his works – &quot;Die Blockade&quot;, &quot;My System&quot; and &quot;Chess Praxis&quot; – established his reputation as one of the father figures of modern chess.&quot; GM Robert Byrne called him &quot;perhaps the most brilliant theoretician and teacher in the history of the game.&quot; GM Jan Hein Donner called Nimzowitsch &quot;a man who was too much of an artist to be able to prove he was right and who was regarded as something of a madman in his time. He would be understood only long after his death.&quot;

Many chess openings and variations are named after Nimzowitsch, the most famous being the Nimzo-Indian Defence (1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4) and the less often played Nimzowitsch Defence (1.e4 Nc6). Nimzowitsch biographer GM Raymond Keene and others have referred to 1.Nf3 followed by 2.b3 as the Nimzowitsch–Larsen Attack. Keene wrote a book about the opening with that title. These openings all exemplify Nimzowitsch&#x27;s ideas about controlling the center with pieces instead of pawns. He was also vital in the development of two important systems in the French Defence, the Winawer Variation (in some places called the Nimzowitsch Variation; its moves are 1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4) and the Advance Variation (1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.e5). He also pioneered two provocative variations of the Sicilian Defence: the Nimzowitsch Variation, 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nf6, which invites 3.e5 Nd5 (similar to Alekhine&#x27;s Defence) and 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 d5?! (the latter regarded as dubious today). International Master John L. Watson has dubbed the line 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 e6 3.Nf3 Bb4 the &quot;Nimzo-English&quot;, employing this designation in Chapter 11 of his book &quot;Mastering the Chess Openings, Volume 3&quot;.

== Personality ==
There are many entertaining anecdotes regarding Nimzowitsch—some less savory than others. An article by Hans Kmoch and Fred Reinfeld entitled &quot;Unconventional Surrender&quot; on page 55 of the February 1950 &quot;Chess Review&quot; tells of the &quot;... example of Nimzowitsch, who ... once missed first prize in a tournament in Berlin by losing to Sämisch, and when it became clear he was going to lose the game, Nimzowitsch stood up on the table and shouted, &#x27;Gegen diesen Idioten muss ich verlieren!&#x27; (&#x27;I must lose to this idiot!&#x27;)&quot;.

Nimzowitsch was annoyed by his opponents&#x27; smoking. A popular, but probably apocryphal, story is that once when an opponent laid an unlit cigar on the table, he complained to the tournament arbiters, &quot;He is threatening to smoke, and as an old player you must know that the threat is stronger than the execution.&quot;

Nimzowitsch had lengthy and somewhat bitter dogmatic conflicts with Tarrasch over whose ideas constituted &#x27;proper&#x27; chess.

Nimzowitsch&#x27;s vanity and faith in his ideas of overprotection provoked Hans Kmoch to write a parody about him in February 1928 in the &quot;Wiener Schachzeitung&quot;. This consisted of a mock game against the fictional player &quot;Systemsson&quot;, supposedly played and annotated by Nimzowitsch himself. The annotations gleefully exaggerate the idea of overprotection, as well as asserting the true genius of the wondrous idea. Kmoch was in fact a great admirer of Nimzowitsch, and Nimzowitsch was amused at the effort.

Kmoch also wrote an article about his nine years with Nimzowitsch: Nimzovich suffered from the delusion that he was unappreciated and that the reason was malice. All it took to make him blossom, as I later learned, was a little praise. His paranoia was most evident when he dined in company. He always thought he was served much smaller portions than everyone else. He didn&#x27;t care about the actual amount but only about the imagined affront. I once suggested that he and I order what the other actually wanted and, when the food was served, exchange plates. After we had done so, he shook his head in disbelief, still thinking that he had received the smaller portion.

Nimzowitsch&#x27;s colleague Tartakower observed of him, &quot;He pretends to be crazy in order to drive us all crazy.&quot;

== Death ==
Although he had long suffered from heart trouble, his early death was unexpected; taken ill suddenly at the end of 1934, he lay bedridden for three months before dying of pneumonia. He is buried in Bispebjerg Cemetery in Copenhagen.

<doc id="2813" wikidata="Q8765" url="?curid=2813" title="Aragonese language">
<text>Aragonese ( ; in Aragonese) is a Romance language spoken in several dialects by about 12,000 people as of 2011, in the Pyrenees valleys of Aragon, Spain, primarily in the comarcas of Somontano de Barbastro, Jacetania, Alto Gállego, Sobrarbe, and Ribagorza/Ribagorça. It is the only modern language which survived from medieval Navarro-Aragonese in a form distinct from Spanish.

Historically, people referred to the language as (&#x27;talk&#x27; or &#x27;speech&#x27;). Native Aragonese people usually refer to it by the names of its local dialects such as (from Valle de Hecho) or (from the Benasque Valley).

==History==
Aragonese, which developed in portions of the Ebro basin, can be traced back to the High Middle Ages. It spread throughout the Pyrenees to areas where languages similar to modern Basque might have been previously spoken. The Kingdom of Aragon (formed by the counties of Aragon, Sobrarbe and Ribagorza) expanded southward from the mountains, pushing the Moors farther south in the &quot;Reconquista&quot; and spreading the Aragonese language.

The union of the Catalan counties and the Kingdom of Aragon which formed the 12th-century Crown of Aragon did not merge the languages of the two territories; Catalan continued to be spoken in the east and Navarro-Aragonese in the west, with the boundaries blurred by dialectal continuity. The Aragonese &quot;Reconquista&quot; in the south ended with the cession of Murcia by James I of Aragon to the Kingdom of Castile as dowry for an Aragonese princess.

The best-known proponent of the Aragonese language was Johan Ferrandez d&#x27;Heredia, the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller in Rhodes at the end of the 14th century. He wrote an extensive catalog of works in Aragonese and translated several works from Greek into Aragonese (the first in medieval Europe).

The spread of Castilian (Spanish), the Castilian origin of the Trastámara dynasty, and the similarity between Castilian (Spanish) and Aragonese facilitated the recession of the latter. A turning point was the 15th-century coronation of the Castilian Ferdinand I of Aragon, also known as Ferdinand of Antequera.

In the early 18th century, after the defeat of the allies of Aragon in the War of the Spanish Succession, Philip V ordered the prohibition of the Aragonese language in schools and the establishment of Castilian (Spanish) as the only official language in Aragon. This was ordered in the Aragonese Nueva Planta decrees of 1707.

In recent times, Aragonese was mostly regarded as a group of rural dialects of Spanish. Compulsory education undermined its already weak position; for example, pupils were punished for using it. However, the 1978 Spanish transition to democracy heralded literary works and studies of the language.

===Modern Aragonese===

Aragonese is the native language of the Aragonese mountain ranges of the Pyrenees, in the &quot;comarcas&quot; of Somontano, Jacetania, Sobrarbe, and Ribagorza. Cities and towns in which Aragonese is spoken are Huesca, Graus, Monzón, Barbastro, Bielsa, Chistén, Fonz, Echo, Estadilla, Benasque, Campo, Sabiñánigo, Jaca, Plan, Ansó, Ayerbe, Broto, and El Grado.

It is spoken as a second language by inhabitants of Zaragoza, Huesca, Ejea de los Caballeros, or Teruel. According to recent polls, there are about 25,500 speakers (2011) including speakers living outside the native area. In 2017, the Dirección General de Política Lingüística de Aragón estimated there were 10,000 to 12,000 active speakers of Aragonese.

In 2009, the Languages Act of Aragon (Law 10/2009) recognized the &quot;native language, original and historic&quot; of Aragon. The language received several linguistic rights, including its use in public administration. Some of the legislation was repealed by a new law in 2013 (Law 3/2013). [See Languages Acts of Aragon for more information on the subject]

*&quot;Southern dialect:&quot; Agüero, Ayerbe, Rasal, Bolea, Lierta, Uesca, Almudévar, Nozito, Labata, Alguezra, Angüés, Pertusa, Balbastro, Nabal

== Phonology ==
===Traits===

Aragonese has many historical traits in common with Catalan. Some are conservative features that are also shared with the Asturleonese languages and Galician–Portuguese, where Spanish innovated in ways that did not spread to nearby languages.

====Shared with Catalan====
*Romance initial &quot;f-&quot; is preserved, e.g. &gt; (&#x27;son&#x27;, Sp. , Cat. , Pt. ).
*Romance groups cl-, fl- and pl- are preserved and in most dialects do not undergo any change, e.g. clavis &gt; clau (&#x27;key&#x27;, Sp. &quot;llave,&quot; Cat. &quot;clau&quot;, Pt. &quot;chave&quot;). However, in some transitional dialects from both sides (Ribagorzano in Aragonese and Ribagorçà and Pallarès in Catalan) it becomes cll-, fll- and pll-, e.g. clavis &gt; cllau.
*Romance palatal approximant (&quot;ge-&quot;, &quot;gi-&quot;, &quot;i-&quot;) consistently became medieval , as in medieval Catalan and Portuguese. This becomes modern &quot;ch&quot; , as a result of the devoicing of sibilants (see below). In Spanish, the medieval result was either /, (modern ), , or nothing, depending on the context. e.g. &gt; (&#x27;young man&#x27;, Sp. , Cat. ), &gt; (&#x27;to freeze&#x27;, Sp. , Cat. ).
*Romance groups &quot;-lt-&quot;, &quot;-ct-&quot; result in , e.g. &gt; (&#x27;done&#x27;, Sp. , Cat. , Gal./Port. ), &gt; (&#x27;many, much&#x27;, Sp. , Cat. , Gal. , Port. ).
*Romance groups &quot;-x-&quot;, &quot;-ps-&quot;, &quot;scj-&quot; result in voiceless palatal fricative &quot;ix&quot; , e.g. &gt; (&#x27;crippled&#x27;, Sp. , Cat. ).
*Romance groups &quot;-lj-&quot;, &quot;-c&#x27;l-&quot;, &quot;-t&#x27;l-&quot; result in palatal lateral &quot;ll&quot; , e.g. &gt; (&#x27;woman&#x27;, Sp. , Cat. ), &gt; (&#x27;needle&#x27;, Sp. , Cat. ).

====Shared with Catalan and Spanish====

*Open &quot;o&quot;, &quot;e&quot; from Romance result systematically in diphthongs , , e.g. &gt; (&#x27;old woman&#x27;, Sp. , Cat. , Pt. ). This includes before a palatal approximant, e.g. &gt; (&#x27;eight&#x27;, Sp. , Cat. , Pt. &quot;oito&quot;). Spanish diphthongizes except before yod, whereas Catalan &quot;only&quot; diphthongizes before yod.
*Voiced stops may be lenited to approximants .

====Shared with Spanish====

*Loss of final unstressed &quot;-e&quot; but not &quot;-o&quot;, e.g. &gt; (&#x27;big&#x27;), &gt; (&#x27;done&#x27;). Catalan loses both &quot;-e&quot; and &quot;-o&quot; (Cat. , &quot;)&quot;; Spanish preserves &quot;-o&quot; and sometimes &quot;-e&quot; (Sp. , ~ ).
*Former voiced sibilants become voiceless (, ).
*The palatal is most often realized as a fricative .

====Shared with neither====

*Latin &quot;-b-&quot; is maintained in past imperfect endings of verbs of the second and third conjugations: (&#x27;he had&#x27;, Sp. , Cat. ), (&#x27;he was sleeping&#x27;, Sp. , Cat. ).
*High Aragonese dialects () and some dialects of Gascon have preserved the voicelessness of many intervocalic stop consonants, e.g. &gt; (&#x27;sheep hurdle&#x27;, Cat. , Fr. ), &gt; (&#x27;crested lark&#x27;, Sp. , Cat. ).
*Several Aragonese dialects maintain Latin &quot;-ll-&quot; as geminate .
*The mid vowels can be as open as , mainly in the Benasque dialect.
*No native word can begin with an , a trait shared with Gascon and Basque.

==Orthography==
Before 2023, Aragonese had three orthographic standards:
* The , codified in 1987 by the Consello d&#x27;a Fabla Aragonesa (CFA) at a convention in Huesca, is used by most Aragonese writers. It has a more uniform system of assigning letters to phonemes, with less regard for etymology; words traditionally written with and are uniformly written with in the Uesca system. Similarly, , , and before and are all written . It uses letters associated with Spanish, such as .
* The , devised in 2004 by the Sociedat de Lingüistica Aragonesa (SLA), is used by some Aragonese writers. It uses etymological forms which are closer to Catalan, Occitan, and medieval Aragonese sources; trying to come closer to the original Aragonese and the other Occitano-Romance languages. In the SLA system , , , and before and are distinct, and the digraph replaces .
* In 2010, the Academia de l&#x27;Aragonés (founded in 2006) established an orthographic standard to modernize medieval orthography and to make it more etymological.

During the 16th century, Aragonese Moriscos wrote &quot;aljamiado&quot; texts (Romance texts in Arabic script), possibly because of their inability to write in Arabic. The language in these texts has a mixture of Aragonese and Castilian traits, and they are among the last known written examples of the Aragonese formerly spoken in central and southern Aragon.

In 2023, a new orthographic standard has been published by the &quot;Academia Aragonesa de la Lengua&quot;. This version is close to the Academia de l&#x27;Aragonés orthography, but with the following differences: is always spelled ⟨cu⟩, e. g. &quot;cuan, cuestión&quot; (exception is made for some loanwords: &quot;quad, quadrívium, quark, quásar, quáter, quórum&quot;); is spelled ⟨ny⟩ or ⟨ñ⟩ by personal preference; final ⟨z⟩ is not written as ⟨tz⟩.

The marginal phoneme (only in loanwords, e. g. &quot;jabugo&quot;) is spelled j in the Uesca, Academia de l&#x27;Aragonés and Academia Aragonesa de la Lengua standards (not mentioned in the SLA standard). Additionally, the Academia de l&#x27;Aragonés and Academia Aragonesa de la Lengua orthographies allow the letter j in some loanwords internationally known with it (e. g. &quot;jazz, jacuzzi&quot;, which normally have in the Aragonese pronunciation) and also mention the letters k and w, also used only in loanwords (w may represent or ).

==Grammar==
Aragonese grammar has a lot in common with Occitan and Catalan, but also Spanish.

=== Articles ===

The definite article in Aragonese has undergone dialect-related changes, with definite articles in Old Aragonese similar to their present Spanish equivalents. There are two main forms:

These forms are used in the eastern and some central dialects.
These forms are used in the western and some central dialects.

===Lexicology===
Neighboring Romance languages have influenced Aragonese. Catalan and Occitan influenced Aragonese for many years. Since the 15th century, Spanish has most influenced Aragonese; it was adopted throughout Aragon as the first language, limiting Aragonese to the northern region surrounding the Pyrenees. French has also influenced Aragonese; Italian loanwords have entered through other languages (such as Catalan), and Portuguese words have entered through Spanish. Germanic words came with the conquest of the region by Germanic peoples during the fifth century, and English has introduced a number of new words into the language.

===Gender===
Words that were part of the Latin second declension—as well as words that joined it later on—are usually masculine:

* &gt; (&#x27;son&#x27;)
* + &gt; (&#x27;squirrel&#x27;)

Words that were part of the Latin first declension are usually feminine:
* &gt; (&#x27;daughter&#x27;).

Some Latin neuter plural nouns joined the first declension as singular feminine nouns: 
* &gt; (&#x27;leaf&#x27;).

Words ending in &quot;-or&quot; are feminine:
* , , , and (in Medieval Aragonese) 

The names of fruit trees usually end in &quot;-era&quot; (a suffix derived from Latin &quot;-aria&quot;) and are usually feminine:
* &quot;a perera&quot;, &quot;a manzanera&quot;, &quot;a nuquera&quot;, , &quot;/&quot; , &quot;a olivera&quot;, &quot;a ciresera&quot;, &quot;l&#x27;almendrera&quot;

The genders of river names vary:

* Many ending in &quot;-a&quot; are feminine: &quot;/&quot;, , , , , , , , etc. The last was known as during the 16th century.
* Many from the second and the third declension are masculine: &quot;L&#x27;Ebro&quot;, &quot;O Galligo&quot;, , .

===Pronouns===
Just like most other Occitano-Romance languages, Aragonese has partitive and locative clitic pronouns derived from the Latin and : &quot;/&quot; and &quot;/&quot;&quot;/&quot;; unlike Ibero-Romance.

Such pronouns are present in most major Romance languages (Catalan and , Occitan and , French and , and Italian and &quot;/&quot;).

&quot;/&quot; is used for:
* Partitive objects: (&quot;I haven&#x27;t seen anything like that&quot;, literally &#x27;Not (of it) I have seen like that&#x27;).
* Partitive subjects: (&quot;It hurts so much&quot;, literally &#x27;(of it) it causes so much of pain&#x27;)
* Ablatives, places from which movements originate: (&quot;Memory goes away&quot;, literally &#x27;(away from [the mind]) memory goes&#x27;)

&quot;/&quot;&quot;/&quot; is used for:
* Locatives, where something takes place: (&quot;There was one of them&quot;), literally &#x27;(Of them) there was one&#x27;)
* Allatives, places that movements go towards or end: (&#x27;Go there (imperative)&#x27;)

==Literature==

Aragonese was not written until the 12th and 13th centuries; the history &quot;&quot;, , , and date from this period; an Aragonese version of the &quot;Chronicle of the Morea&quot; also exists, differing also in its content and written in the late 14th century called .

===Early modern period===
Since 1500, Spanish has been the cultural language of Aragon; many Aragonese wrote in Spanish, and during the 17th century the Argensola brothers went to Castile to teach Spanish.
Aragonese became a popular village language. During the 17th century, popular literature in the language began to appear. In a 1650 Huesca literary contest, Aragonese poems were submitted by Matías Pradas, Isabel de Rodas and &quot;Fileno, montañés&quot;.

===Contemporary literature===
The 19th and 20th centuries have seen a renaissance of Aragonese literature in several dialects. In 1844, Braulio Foz&#x27;s novel was published in the Almudévar (southern) dialect. The 20th century featured Domingo Miral&#x27;s costumbrist comedies and Veremundo Méndez Coarasa&#x27;s poetry, both in Hecho (western) Aragonese; Cleto Torrodellas&#x27; poetry and Tonón de Baldomera&#x27;s popular writings in the Graus (eastern) dialect and Arnal Cavero&#x27;s costumbrist stories and Juana Coscujuela&#x27;s novel , also in the southern dialect.

==Aragonese in modern education==
The 1997 Aragonese law of languages stipulated that Aragonese (and Catalan) speakers had a right to the teaching of and in their own language. Following this, Aragonese lessons started in schools in the 1997–1998 academic year. It was originally taught as an extra-curricular, non-evaluable voluntary subject in four schools. However, whilst legally schools can choose to use Aragonese as the language of instruction, as of the 2013–2014 academic year, there are no recorded instances of this option being taken in primary or secondary education. In fact, the only current scenario in which Aragonese is used as the language of instruction is in the Aragonese philology university course, which is optional, taught over the summer and in which only some of the lectures are in Aragonese.

===Pre-school education===
In pre-school education, students whose parents wish them to be taught Aragonese receive between thirty minutes to one hour of Aragonese lessons a week. In the 2014–2015 academic year there were 262 students recorded in pre-school Aragonese lessons.

===Primary school education===
The subject of Aragonese now has a fully developed curriculum in primary education in Aragon. Despite this, in the 2014–2015 academic year there were only seven Aragonese teachers in the region across both pre-primary and primary education and none hold permanent positions, whilst the number of primary education students receiving Aragonese lessons was 320.

As of 2017 there were 1068 reported Aragonese language students and 12 Aragonese language instructors in Aragon.

===Secondary school education===
There is no officially approved program or teaching materials for the Aragonese language at the secondary level, and though two non-official textbooks are available ( (Benítez, 2007) and (Campos, 2014)) many instructors create their own learning materials. Further, most schools with Aragonese programs that have the possibility of being offered as an examinative subject have elected not to do so.

As of 2007 it is possible to use Aragonese as a language of instruction for multiple courses; however, no program is yet to instruct any curricular or examinative courses in Aragonese.
As of the 2014–2015 academic year there were 14 Aragonese language students at the secondary level.

===Higher education===
Aragonese is not currently a possible field of study for a bachelor&#x27;s or postgraduate degree in any official capacity, nor is Aragonese used as a medium of instruction. A bachelor&#x27;s or master&#x27;s degree may be obtained in Magisterio (teaching) at the University of Zaragoza; however, no specialization in Aragonese language is currently available. As such those who wish to teach Aragonese at the pre-school, primary, or secondary level must already be competent in the language by being a native speaker or by other means. Further, prospective instructors must pass an ad hoc exam curated by the individual schools at which they wish to teach in order to prove their competence, as there are no recognized standard competency exams for the Aragonese language.

Since the 1994–1995 academic year, Aragonese has been an elective subject within the bachelor&#x27;s degree for primary school education at the University of Zaragoza&#x27;s Huesca campus.

The University of Zaragoza&#x27;s Huesca campus also offers a &quot;Diploma de Especialización&quot; (These are studies that require a previous university degree and have a duration of between 30 and 59 ECTS credits.) in Aragonese Philology with 37 ECTS credits.

<text>Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS) was an analog mobile phone system standard originally developed by Bell Labs and later modified in a cooperative effort between Bell Labs and Motorola. It was officially introduced in the Americas on October 13, 1983, and was deployed in many other countries too, including Israel in 1986, Australia in 1987, Singapore in 1988, and Pakistan in 1990. It was the primary analog mobile phone system in North America (and other locales) through the 1980s and into the 2000s. As of February 18, 2008, carriers in the United States were no longer required to support AMPS and companies such as AT&amp;T and Verizon Communications have discontinued this service permanently. AMPS was discontinued in Australia in September 2000, in India by October 2004, in Israel by January 2010, and Brazil by 2010.

== History ==
The first cellular network efforts began at Bell Labs and with research conducted at Motorola.
In 1960, John F. Mitchell
became Motorola&#x27;s chief engineer for its mobile-communication products, and oversaw the development and marketing of the first pager to use transistors.

Motorola had long produced mobile telephones for automobiles, but these large and heavy models consumed too much power to allow their use without the automobile&#x27;s engine running. Mitchell&#x27;s team, which included Dr. Martin Cooper, developed portable cellular telephony. Cooper and Mitchell were among the Motorola employees granted a patent for this work in 1973. The first call on the prototype connected, reportedly, to a wrong number.

While Motorola was developing a cellular phone, from 1968 to 1983 Bell Labs worked out a system called Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS), which became the first cellular network standard in the United States. The Bell system deployed ASTM in Chicago, Illinois, first as an equipment test serving approximately 100 units in 1978, and subsequently as a service test planned for 2,000 billed units. Motorola and others designed and built the cellular phones for this and other cellular systems. Louis M. Weinberg, a marketing director at AT&amp;T, was named the first president of the AMPS corporation. He served in this position during the startup of the AMPS subsidiary of AT&amp;T.

Martin Cooper, a former general manager for the systems division at Motorola, led a team that produced the first cellular handset in 1973 and made the first phone call from it. In 1983 Motorola introduced the DynaTAC 8000x, the first commercially available cellular phone small enough to be easily carried. He later introduced the so-called Bag Phone.

In 1992, the first smartphone, called IBM Simon, used AMPS. Frank Canova led its design at IBM and it was demonstrated that year at the COMDEX computer-industry trade-show. A refined version of the product was marketed to consumers in 1994 by BellSouth under the name Simon Personal Communicator. The Simon was the first device that can be properly referred to as a &quot;smartphone&quot;, even though that term was not yet coined.

== Technology ==
AMPS is a first-generation cellular technology that uses separate frequencies, or &quot;channels&quot;, for each conversation. It therefore required considerable bandwidth for a large number of users. In general terms, AMPS was very similar to the older &quot;0G&quot; Improved Mobile Telephone Service it replaced, but used considerably more computing power to select frequencies, hand off conversations to land lines, and handle billing and call setup.

What really separated AMPS from older systems is the &quot;back end&quot; call setup functionality. In AMPS, the cell centers could flexibly assign channels to handsets based on signal strength, allowing the same frequency to be re-used, without interference, if locations were separated enough. The channels were grouped so a specific set was different of the one used on the cell nearby. This allowed a larger number of phones to be supported over a geographical area. AMPS pioneers coined the term &quot;cellular&quot; because of its use of small hexagonal &quot;cells&quot; within a system.

AMPS suffered from many weaknesses compared to today&#x27;s digital technologies. As an analog standard, it was susceptible to static and noise, and there was no protection from &#x27;eavesdropping&#x27; using a scanner or an older TV set that could tune into channels 70–83.

==Cloning==

In the 1990s, an epidemic of &quot;cloning&quot; cost the cellular carriers millions of dollars. An eavesdropper with specialized equipment could intercept a handset&#x27;s ESN (Electronic Serial Number) and MDN or CTN (Mobile Directory Number or Cellular Telephone Number). The Electronic Serial Number, a 12-digit number sent by the handset to the cellular system for billing purposes, uniquely identified that phone on the network. The system then allowed or disallowed calls and/or features based on its customer file. A person intercepting an ESN/MDN pair could clone the combination onto a different phone and use it in other areas for making calls without paying.

Cellular phone cloning became possible with off-the-shelf technology in the 1990s. Would-be cloners required three key items :

# A radio receiver, such as the Icom PCR-1000, that could tune into the Reverse Channel (the frequency on which AMPS phones transmit data to the tower)
# A PC with a sound card and a software program called Banpaia
# A phone that could easily be used for cloning, such as the Oki 900

The radio, when tuned to the proper frequency, would receive the signal transmitted by the cell phone to be cloned, containing the phone&#x27;s ESN/MDN pair. This signal would feed into the sound-card audio-input of the PC, and Banpaia would decode the ESN/MDN pair from this signal and display it on the screen. The hacker could then copy that data into the Oki 900 phone and reboot it, after which the phone network could not distinguish the Oki from the original phone whose signal had been received. This gave the cloner, through the Oki phone, the ability to use the mobile-phone service of the legitimate subscriber whose phone was cloned – just as if that phone had been physically stolen, except that the subscriber retained his or her phone, unaware that the phone had been cloned—at least until that subscriber received his or her next bill.

The problem became so large that some carriers required the use of a PIN before making calls. Eventually, the cellular companies initiated a system called RF Fingerprinting, whereby it could determine subtle differences in the signal of one phone from another and shut down some cloned phones. Some legitimate customers had problems with this though if they made certain changes to their own phone, such as replacing the battery and/or antenna.

The Oki 900 could listen in to AMPS phone-calls right out-of-the-box with no hardware modifications.

==Standards==
AMPS was originally standardized by American National Standards Institute (ANSI) as EIA/TIA/IS-3. EIA/TIA/IS-3 was superseded by EIA/TIA-553 and TIA interim standard with digital technologies, the cost of wireless service is so low that the problem of cloning has virtually disappeared.

==Frequency bands==
AMPS cellular service operated in the 850 MHz Cellular band. For each market area, the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) allowed two licensees (networks) known as &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; carriers. Each carrier within a market used a specified &quot;block&quot; of frequencies consisting of 21 control channels and 395 voice channels. Originally, the B (wireline) side license was usually owned by the local phone company, and the A (non-wireline) license was given to wireless telephone providers.

At the inception of cellular in 1983, the FCC had granted each carrier within a market 333 channel pairs (666 channels total). By the late 1980s, the cellular industry&#x27;s subscriber base had grown into the millions across America and it became necessary to add channels for additional capacity. In 1989, the FCC granted carriers an expansion from the previous 666 channels to the final 832 (416 pairs per carrier). The additional frequencies were from the band held in reserve for future (inevitable) expansion. These frequencies were immediately adjacent to the existing cellular band. These bands had previously been allocated to UHF TV channels 70–83.

Each duplex channel was composed of 2 frequencies. 416 of these were in the 824–849 MHz range for transmissions from mobile stations to the base stations, paired with 416 frequencies in the 869–894 MHz range for transmissions from base stations to the mobile stations. Each cell site used a different subset of these channels than its neighbors to avoid interference. This significantly reduced the number of channels available at each site in real-world systems. Each AMPS channel had a one way bandwidth of 30 kHz, for a total of 60 kHz for each duplex channel.

Laws were passed in the US which prohibited the FCC type acceptance and sale of any receiver which could tune the frequency ranges occupied by analog AMPS cellular services. Though the service is no longer offered, these laws remain in force (although they may no longer be enforced).

==Narrowband AMPS==
In 1991, Motorola proposed an AMPS enhancement known as narrowband AMPS (NAMPS or N-AMPS).

==Digital AMPS==

Later, many AMPS networks were partially converted to D-AMPS, often referred to as TDMA (though TDMA is a generic term that applies to many 2G cellular systems). D-AMPS, commercially deployed since 1993, was a digital, 2G standard used mainly by AT&amp;T Mobility and U.S. Cellular in the United States, Rogers Wireless in Canada, Telcel in Mexico, Telecom Italia Mobile (TIM) in Brazil, VimpelCom in Russia, Movilnet in Venezuela, and Cellcom in Israel. In most areas, D-AMPS is no longer offered and has been replaced by more advanced digital wireless networks.

==Successor technologies==
AMPS and D-AMPS have now been phased out in favor of either CDMA2000 or GSM, which allow for higher capacity data transfers for services such as WAP, Multimedia Messaging System (MMS), and wireless Internet access. There are some phones capable of supporting AMPS, D-AMPS and GSM all in one phone (using the GAIT standard).

==Analog AMPS being replaced by digital==
In 2002, the FCC decided to no longer require A and B carriers to support AMPS service as of February 18, 2008. All AMPS carriers have converted to a digital standard such as CDMA2000 or GSM. Digital technologies such as GSM and CDMA2000 support multiple voice calls on the same channel and offer enhanced features such as two-way text messaging and data services.

Unlike in the United States, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) and Industry Canada have not set any requirement for maintaining AMPS service in Canada. Rogers Wireless has dismantled their AMPS (along with IS-136) network; the networks were shut down May 31, 2007. Bell Mobility and Telus Mobility, who operated AMPS networks in Canada, announced that they would observe the same timetable as outlined by the FCC in the United States, and as a result would not begin to dismantle their AMPS networks until after February 2008.

OnStar relied heavily on North American AMPS service for its subscribers because, when the system was developed, AMPS offered the most comprehensive wireless coverage in the US. In 2006, ADT asked the FCC to extend the AMPS deadline due to many of their alarm systems still using analog technology to communicate with the control centers. Cellular companies who own an A or B license (such as Verizon and Alltel) were required to provide analog service until February 18, 2008. After that point, however, most cellular companies were eager to shut down AMPS and use the remaining channels for digital services. OnStar transitioned to digital service with the help of data transport technology developed by Airbiquity, but warned customers who could not be upgraded to digital service that their service would permanently expire on January 1, 2008.

<doc id="2819" wikidata="Q8424" url="?curid=2819" title="Aerodynamics">
<text>Aerodynamics ( &quot;aero&quot; (air) + (dynamics)) is the study of the motion of air, particularly when affected by a solid object, such as an airplane wing. It involves topics covered in the field of fluid dynamics and its subfield of gas dynamics, and is an important domain of study in aeronautics. The term &quot;aerodynamics&quot; is often used synonymously with gas dynamics, the difference being that &quot;gas dynamics&quot; applies to the study of the motion of all gases, and is not limited to air. The formal study of aerodynamics began in the modern sense in the eighteenth century, although observations of fundamental concepts such as aerodynamic drag were recorded much earlier. Most of the early efforts in aerodynamics were directed toward achieving heavier-than-air flight, which was first demonstrated by Otto Lilienthal in 1891. Since then, the use of aerodynamics through mathematical analysis, empirical approximations, wind tunnel experimentation, and computer simulations has formed a rational basis for the development of heavier-than-air flight and a number of other technologies. Recent work in aerodynamics has focused on issues related to compressible flow, turbulence, and boundary layers and has become increasingly computational in nature.

==History==

Modern aerodynamics only dates back to the seventeenth century, but aerodynamic forces have been harnessed by humans for thousands of years in sailboats and windmills, and images and stories of flight appear throughout recorded history, such as the Ancient Greek legend of Icarus and Daedalus. Fundamental concepts of continuum, drag, and pressure gradients appear in the work of Aristotle and Archimedes.

In 1726, Sir Isaac Newton became the first person to develop a theory of air resistance, making him one of the first aerodynamicists. Dutch-Swiss mathematician Daniel Bernoulli followed in 1738 with &quot;Hydrodynamica&quot; in which he described a fundamental relationship between pressure, density, and flow velocity for incompressible flow known today as Bernoulli&#x27;s principle, which provides one method for calculating aerodynamic lift. In 1757, Leonhard Euler published the more general Euler equations which could be applied to both compressible and incompressible flows. The Euler equations were extended to incorporate the effects of viscosity in the first half of the 1800s, resulting in the Navier–Stokes equations. The Navier–Stokes equations are the most general governing equations of fluid flow but are difficult to solve for the flow around all but the simplest of shapes.

In 1799, Sir George Cayley became the first person to identify the four aerodynamic forces of flight (weight, lift, drag, and thrust), as well as the relationships between them, and in doing so outlined the path toward achieving heavier-than-air flight for the next century. In 1871, Francis Herbert Wenham constructed the first wind tunnel, allowing precise measurements of aerodynamic forces. Drag theories were developed by Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert, Gustav Kirchhoff, and Lord Rayleigh. In 1889, Charles Renard, a French aeronautical engineer, became the first person to reasonably predict the power needed for sustained flight. Otto Lilienthal, the first person to become highly successful with glider flights, was also the first to propose thin, curved airfoils that would produce high lift and low drag. Building on these developments as well as research carried out in their own wind tunnel, the Wright brothers flew the first powered airplane on December 17, 1903.

During the time of the first flights, Frederick W. Lanchester, Martin Kutta, and Nikolai Zhukovsky independently created theories that connected circulation of a fluid flow to lift. Kutta and Zhukovsky went on to develop a two-dimensional wing theory. Expanding upon the work of Lanchester, Ludwig Prandtl is credited with developing the mathematics behind thin-airfoil and lifting-line theories as well as work with boundary layers.

As aircraft speed increased designers began to encounter challenges associated with air compressibility at speeds near the speed of sound. The differences in airflow under such conditions lead to problems in aircraft control, increased drag due to shock waves, and the threat of structural failure due to aeroelastic flutter. The ratio of the flow speed to the speed of sound was named the Mach number after Ernst Mach who was one of the first to investigate the properties of the supersonic flow. Macquorn Rankine and Pierre Henri Hugoniot independently developed the theory for flow properties before and after a shock wave, while Jakob Ackeret led the initial work of calculating the lift and drag of supersonic airfoils. Theodore von Kármán and Hugh Latimer Dryden introduced the term transonic to describe flow speeds between the critical Mach number and Mach 1 where drag increases rapidly. This rapid increase in drag led aerodynamicists and aviators to disagree on whether supersonic flight was achievable until the sound barrier was broken in 1947 using the Bell X-1 aircraft.

By the time the sound barrier was broken, aerodynamicists&#x27; understanding of the subsonic and low supersonic flow had matured. The Cold War prompted the design of an ever-evolving line of high-performance aircraft. Computational fluid dynamics began as an effort to solve for flow properties around complex objects and has rapidly grown to the point where entire aircraft can be designed using computer software, with wind-tunnel tests followed by flight tests to confirm the computer predictions. Understanding of supersonic and hypersonic aerodynamics has matured since the 1960s, and the goals of aerodynamicists have shifted from the behaviour of fluid flow to the engineering of a vehicle such that it interacts predictably with the fluid flow. Designing aircraft for supersonic and hypersonic conditions, as well as the desire to improve the aerodynamic efficiency of current aircraft and propulsion systems, continues to motivate new research in aerodynamics, while work continues to be done on important problems in basic aerodynamic theory related to flow turbulence and the existence and uniqueness of analytical solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations.

==Fundamental concepts==

Understanding the motion of air around an object (often called a flow field) enables the calculation of forces and moments acting on the object. In many aerodynamics problems, the forces of interest are the fundamental forces of flight: lift, drag, thrust, and weight. Of these, lift and drag are aerodynamic forces, i.e. forces due to air flow over a solid body. Calculation of these quantities is often founded upon the assumption that the flow field behaves as a continuum. Continuum flow fields are characterized by properties such as flow velocity, pressure, density, and temperature, which may be functions of position and time. These properties may be directly or indirectly measured in aerodynamics experiments or calculated starting with the equations for conservation of mass, momentum, and energy in air flows. Density, flow velocity, and an additional property, viscosity, are used to classify flow fields.

===Flow classification===
Flow velocity is used to classify flows according to speed regime. Subsonic flows are flow fields in which the air speed field is always below the local speed of sound. Transonic flows include both regions of subsonic flow and regions in which the local flow speed is greater than the local speed of sound. Supersonic flows are defined to be flows in which the flow speed is greater than the speed of sound everywhere. A fourth classification, hypersonic flow, refers to flows where the flow speed is much greater than the speed of sound. Aerodynamicists disagree on the precise definition of hypersonic flow.

Compressible flow accounts for varying density within the flow. Subsonic flows are often idealized as incompressible, i.e. the density is assumed to be constant. Transonic and supersonic flows are compressible, and calculations that neglect the changes of density in these flow fields will yield inaccurate results.

Viscosity is associated with the frictional forces in a flow. In some flow fields, viscous effects are very small, and approximate solutions may safely neglect viscous effects. These approximations are called inviscid flows. Flows for which viscosity is not neglected are called viscous flows. Finally, aerodynamic problems may also be classified by the flow environment. External aerodynamics is the study of flow around solid objects of various shapes (e.g. around an airplane wing), while internal aerodynamics is the study of flow through passages inside solid objects (e.g. through a jet engine).

====Continuum assumption====
Unlike liquids and solids, gases are composed of discrete molecules which occupy only a small fraction of the volume filled by the gas. On a molecular level, flow fields are made up of the collisions of many individual of gas molecules between themselves and with solid surfaces. However, in most aerodynamics applications, the discrete molecular nature of gases is ignored, and the flow field is assumed to behave as a continuum. This assumption allows fluid properties such as density and flow velocity to be defined everywhere within the flow.

The validity of the continuum assumption is dependent on the density of the gas and the application in question. For the continuum assumption to be valid, the mean free path length must be much smaller than the length scale of the application in question. For example, many aerodynamics applications deal with aircraft flying in atmospheric conditions, where the mean free path length is on the order of micrometers and where the body is orders of magnitude larger. In these cases, the length scale of the aircraft ranges from a few meters to a few tens of meters, which is much larger than the mean free path length. For such applications, the continuum assumption is reasonable. The continuum assumption is less valid for extremely low-density flows, such as those encountered by vehicles at very high altitudes (e.g. 300,000 ft/90 km) or satellites in Low Earth orbit. In those cases, statistical mechanics is a more accurate method of solving the problem than is continuum aerodynamics. The Knudsen number can be used to guide the choice between statistical mechanics and the continuous formulation of aerodynamics.

===Conservation laws===
The assumption of a fluid continuum allows problems in aerodynamics to be solved using fluid dynamics conservation laws. Three conservation principles are used: 
; Conservation of mass: Conservation of mass requires that mass is neither created nor destroyed within a flow; the mathematical formulation of this principle is known as the mass continuity equation.
; Conservation of momentum: The mathematical formulation of this principle can be considered an application of Newton&#x27;s Second Law. Momentum within a flow is only changed by external forces, which may include both surface forces, such as viscous (frictional) forces, and body forces, such as weight. The momentum conservation principle may be expressed as either a vector equation or separated into a set of three scalar equations (x,y,z components). 
; Conservation of energy: The energy conservation equation states that energy is neither created nor destroyed within a flow, and that any addition or subtraction of energy to a volume in the flow is caused by heat transfer, or by work into and out of the region of interest.

Together, these equations are known as the Navier–Stokes equations, although some authors define the term to only include the momentum equation(s). The Navier–Stokes equations have no known analytical solution and are solved in modern aerodynamics using computational techniques. Because computational methods using high speed computers were not historically available and the high computational cost of solving these complex equations now that they are available, simplifications of the Navier–Stokes equations have been and continue to be employed. The Euler equations are a set of similar conservation equations which neglect viscosity and may be used in cases where the effect of viscosity is expected to be small. Further simplifications lead to Laplace&#x27;s equation and potential flow theory. Additionally, Bernoulli&#x27;s equation is a solution in one dimension to both the momentum and energy conservation equations.

The ideal gas law or another such equation of state is often used in conjunction with these equations to form a determined system that allows the solution for the unknown variables.

==Branches of aerodynamics==

Aerodynamic problems are classified by the flow environment or properties of the flow, including flow speed, compressibility, and viscosity. &quot;External&quot; aerodynamics is the study of flow around solid objects of various shapes. Evaluating the lift and drag on an airplane or the shock waves that form in front of the nose of a rocket are examples of external aerodynamics. &quot;Internal&quot; aerodynamics is the study of flow through passages in solid objects. For instance, internal aerodynamics encompasses the study of the airflow through a jet engine or through an air conditioning pipe.

Aerodynamic problems can also be classified according to whether the flow speed is below, near or above the speed of sound. A problem is called subsonic if all the speeds in the problem are less than the speed of sound, transonic if speeds both below and above the speed of sound are present (normally when the characteristic speed is approximately the speed of sound), supersonic when the characteristic flow speed is greater than the speed of sound, and hypersonic when the flow speed is much greater than the speed of sound. Aerodynamicists disagree over the precise definition of hypersonic flow; a rough definition considers flows with Mach numbers above 5 to be hypersonic.

The influence of viscosity on the flow dictates a third classification. Some problems may encounter only very small viscous effects, in which case viscosity can be considered to be negligible. The approximations to these problems are called inviscid flows. Flows for which viscosity cannot be neglected are called viscous flows.

===Incompressible aerodynamics===

An incompressible flow is a flow in which density is constant in both time and space. Although all real fluids are compressible, a flow is often approximated as incompressible if the effect of the density changes cause only small changes to the calculated results. This is more likely to be true when the flow speeds are significantly lower than the speed of sound. Effects of compressibility are more significant at speeds close to or above the speed of sound. The Mach number is used to evaluate whether the incompressibility can be assumed, otherwise the effects of compressibility must be included.

====Subsonic flow====
Subsonic (or low-speed) aerodynamics describes fluid motion in flows which are much lower than the speed of sound everywhere in the flow. There are several branches of subsonic flow but one special case arises when the flow is inviscid, incompressible and irrotational. This case is called potential flow and allows the differential equations that describe the flow to be a simplified version of the equations of fluid dynamics, thus making available to the aerodynamicist a range of quick and easy solutions.

In solving a subsonic problem, one decision to be made by the aerodynamicist is whether to incorporate the effects of compressibility. Compressibility is a description of the amount of change of density in the flow. When the effects of compressibility on the solution are small, the assumption that density is constant may be made. The problem is then an incompressible low-speed aerodynamics problem. When the density is allowed to vary, the flow is called compressible. In air, compressibility effects are usually ignored when the Mach number in the flow does not exceed 0.3 (about 335 feet (102 m) per second or 228 miles (366 km) per hour at 60 °F (16 °C)). Above Mach 0.3, the problem flow should be described using compressible aerodynamics.

===Compressible aerodynamics===

According to the theory of aerodynamics, a flow is considered to be compressible if the density changes along a streamline. This means that – unlike incompressible flow – changes in density are considered. In general, this is the case where the Mach number in part or all of the flow exceeds 0.3. The Mach 0.3 value is rather arbitrary, but it is used because gas flows with a Mach number below that value demonstrate changes in density of less than 5%. Furthermore, that maximum 5% density change occurs at the stagnation point (the point on the object where flow speed is zero), while the density changes around the rest of the object will be significantly lower. Transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic flows are all compressible flows.

====Transonic flow====

The term Transonic refers to a range of flow velocities just below and above the local speed of sound (generally taken as Mach 0.8–1.2). It is defined as the range of speeds between the critical Mach number, when some parts of the airflow over an aircraft become supersonic, and a higher speed, typically near Mach 1.2, when all of the airflow is supersonic. Between these speeds, some of the airflow is supersonic, while some of the airflow is not supersonic.

====Supersonic flow====

Supersonic aerodynamic problems are those involving flow speeds greater than the speed of sound. Calculating the lift on the Concorde during cruise can be an example of a supersonic aerodynamic problem.

Supersonic flow behaves very differently from subsonic flow. Fluids react to differences in pressure; pressure changes are how a fluid is &quot;told&quot; to respond to its environment. Therefore, since sound is, in fact, an infinitesimal pressure difference propagating through a fluid, the speed of sound in that fluid can be considered the fastest speed that &quot;information&quot; can travel in the flow. This difference most obviously manifests itself in the case of a fluid striking an object. In front of that object, the fluid builds up a stagnation pressure as impact with the object brings the moving fluid to rest. In fluid traveling at subsonic speed, this pressure disturbance can propagate upstream, changing the flow pattern ahead of the object and giving the impression that the fluid &quot;knows&quot; the object is there by seemingly adjusting its movement and is flowing around it. In a supersonic flow, however, the pressure disturbance cannot propagate upstream. Thus, when the fluid finally reaches the object it strikes it and the fluid is forced to change its properties – temperature, density, pressure, and Mach number—in an extremely violent and irreversible fashion called a shock wave. The presence of shock waves, along with the compressibility effects of high-flow velocity (see Reynolds number) fluids, is the central difference between the supersonic and subsonic aerodynamics regimes.

====Hypersonic flow====

In aerodynamics, hypersonic speeds are speeds that are highly supersonic. In the 1970s, the term generally came to refer to speeds of Mach 5 (5 times the speed of sound) and above. The hypersonic regime is a subset of the supersonic regime. Hypersonic flow is characterized by high temperature flow behind a shock wave, viscous interaction, and chemical dissociation of gas.

==Associated terminology==
The incompressible and compressible flow regimes produce many associated phenomena, such as boundary layers and turbulence.

===Boundary layers===

The concept of a boundary layer is important in many problems in aerodynamics. The viscosity and fluid friction in the air is approximated as being significant only in this thin layer. This assumption makes the description of such aerodynamics much more tractable mathematically.

===Turbulence===

In aerodynamics, turbulence is characterized by chaotic property changes in the flow. These include low momentum diffusion, high momentum convection, and rapid variation of pressure and flow velocity in space and time. Flow that is not turbulent is called laminar flow.

==Aerodynamics in other fields==
===Engineering design===

Aerodynamics is a significant element of vehicle design, including road cars and trucks where the main goal is to reduce the vehicle drag coefficient, and racing cars, where in addition to reducing drag the goal is also to increase the overall level of downforce. Aerodynamics is also important in the prediction of forces and moments acting on sailing vessels. It is used in the design of mechanical components such as hard drive heads. Structural engineers resort to aerodynamics, and particularly aeroelasticity, when calculating wind loads in the design of large buildings, bridges, and wind turbines.

The aerodynamics of internal passages is important in heating/ventilation, gas piping, and in automotive engines where detailed flow patterns strongly affect the performance of the engine.

===Environmental design===
Urban aerodynamics are studied by town planners and designers seeking to improve amenity in outdoor spaces, or in creating urban microclimates to reduce the effects of urban pollution. The field of environmental aerodynamics describes ways in which atmospheric circulation and flight mechanics affect ecosystems.

Aerodynamic equations are used in numerical weather prediction.

===Ball-control in sports===
Sports in which aerodynamics are of crucial importance include soccer, table tennis, cricket, baseball, and golf, in which most players can control the trajectory of the ball using the &quot;Magnus effect&quot;.

<text>Andreas Schlüter (1659 – ) was a German baroque sculptor and architect, active in the Holy Roman Empire, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and Russia.

==Biography==
Andreas Schlüter was born probably in Hamburg. His early life is obscure as at least three different persons of that name are documented. The records of St. Michaelis Church, Hamburg show that an Andreas Schlüter, son of sculptor Gerhart Schlüter, had been baptized there on 22 May 1664. Documents from Gdańsk reported that an Andreas Schlüter &quot;(senior)&quot; had worked 1640–1652 in Gdańsk&#x27;s Jopengasse lane (today&#x27;s ulica Piwna). Possibly born in 1640, an &quot;Andres Schliter&quot; is recorded as apprentice on 9 May 1656 by the mason&#x27;s guild. Other sources state 1659 as year of birth.

He probably did spend several years abroad as Journeyman. His first work, in 1675, may have been epitaphs of the Dukes Sambor and Mestwin in the dome of Pelplin monastery.

Schlüter&#x27;s first known work was the decoration of the facade of the Gdańsk Royal Chapel, in 1681. He later created statues for King John III Sobieski&#x27;s Wilanów Palace in Warsaw and sepulchral sculptures in Zhovkva. In 1689, he moved to Warsaw and made the pediment reliefs and sculptural work of Krasiński Palace.

Schlüter was invited to Berlin in 1694 by Eberhard von Danckelmann to work as court sculptor at the armory (&quot;Zeughaus&quot;) for Elector Frederick III. His sculpted decorations are a masterpiece of baroque expression and pathos. While the more visible reliefs on the outside had to praise fighting, the statues of dying warriors in the interior denounced war and gave an indication of his pacifist religious beliefs (he is said to have been a Mennonite). Travelling through Italy in 1696, he studied the work of masters like Michelangelo Buonarroti and Gian Lorenzo Bernini.

Schlüter also worked as an architect and built many state buildings in Berlin in his role as &quot;Hofbaumeister&quot; (Court Architect), which he lost when one tower showed signs of a weak fundament. He also served as director of the Prussian Academy of Arts from 1702 to 1704, after which he began concentrating on sculpting again, as &quot;Hofbildhauer&quot; (Court Sculptor). His most important equestrian sculpture is that of the &quot;Great Elector&quot;, Frederick William of Brandenburg, cast in 1708 and placed at &quot;Lange Brücke&quot; near the Berlin City Palace, now situated in the honor court before Charlottenburg Palace.

The Berlin City Palace, and many of his works, were partially destroyed by bombing in World War II and by the subsequent Communist regime. A similar fate probably befell the Amber Room, made between 1701 and 1709, Schlüter&#x27;s most famous work of architecture.

The Berlin City Palace was reconstructed between 2013 and 2020.

In 1713, Schlüter&#x27;s fame brought him to work for Tsar Peter I of Russia in Saint Petersburg, where he died of an illness after creating several designs. Together with Johann Friedrich Braunstein, he designed the Grand Palace and Monplaisir Palace in Peterhof Palace Complex. Also the city&#x27;s oldest building, Kikin Hall, and the reliefs at the Summer Palace are attributed to him. This way he became an important figure of Petrine Baroque.

<text>Ash is the solid remnants of fires. Specifically, &quot;ash&quot; refers to all non-aqueous, non-gaseous residues that remain after something burns. In analytical chemistry, to analyse the mineral and metal content of chemical samples, ash is the non-gaseous, non-liquid residue after complete combustion.

Ashes as the end product of incomplete combustion are mostly mineral, but usually still contain an amount of combustible organic or other oxidizable residues. The best-known type of ash is wood ash, as a product of wood combustion in campfires, fireplaces, etc. The darker the wood ashes, the higher the content of remaining charcoal from incomplete combustion. The ashes are of different types. Some ashes contain natural compounds that make soil fertile. Others have chemical compounds that can be toxic but may break up in soil from chemical changes and microorganism activity.

Like soap, ash is also a disinfecting agent (alkaline). The World Health Organization recommends ash or sand as alternative for handwashing when soap is not available. Before industrialization, ash soaked in water was the primary means of obtaining potash.

==Natural occurrence==
Ash occurs naturally from any fire that burns vegetation, and may disperse in the soil to fertilise it, or clump under it for long enough to carbonise into coal.

==Composition==
The composition of the ash varies depending on the product burned and its origin. The &quot;ash content&quot; or &quot;mineral content&quot; of a product is derived its incineration under temperatures ranging from to .

===Wood and plant matter===

The composition of ash derived from wood and other plant matter varies based on plant species, parts of the plants (such as bark, trunk, or young branches with foliage), type of soil, and time of year. The composition of these ashes also differ greatly depending on mode of combustion.

Wood ashes, in addition to residual carbonaceous materials (unconsumed embers, activated carbons impregnated with carbonaceous particles, tars, various gases, etc.), contain a between 20% and 50% calcium in the form of calcium oxide and are generally rich in potassium carbonate. Ashes derived from grasses, and the Gramineae family in particular, are rich in silica. The color of the ash comes from small proportions of inorganic minerals such as iron oxides and manganese. The oxidized metal elements that constitute wood ash are mostly considered alkaline.

For example, ash collected from wood boilers is composed of
* 17–33% calcium in the form of calcium oxide ()
* 2–6% potassium in the form of potassium oxide ()
* 2.5–4.6% magnesium in the form of magnesium oxide ()
* 1–6% phosphorus in the form of phosphorus pentoxide ()
* 3% in total of oxides such as iron oxide, manganese oxide, and sodium oxide
The pH of the ash is between 10 and 13, mostly due to the fact that the oxides of calcium, potassium, and sodium are strong bases. Acidic components such as carbon dioxide, phosphoric acid, silicic acid, and sulfuric acid are rarely present and, in the presence of the previously mentioned bases, are generally found in the form of salts, respectively carbonates, phosphates, silicates and sulphates.

Strictly speaking, calcium and potassium salts produce the aforementioned calcium oxide (also known as quicklime) and potassium during the combustion of organic matter. But, in practice, quicklime is only obtained via lime-kiln, and potash (from potassium carbonate) or baking soda (from sodium carbonate) is extracted from the ashes.

Other substances such as sulfur, chlorine, iron or sodium only appear in small quantities. Still others are rarely found in wood, such as aluminum, zinc, and boron. (depending on the trace elements drawn from the soil by the incinerated plants).

Mineral content in ash depends on the species of tree burned, even in the same soil conditions. More chloride is found in conifer trees than broadleaf trees, with seven times as much found in spruces than in oak trees. There is twice as much phosphoric acid in the European aspen than in oaks and twice as much magnesium in elm trees than in the Scotch pine.

Ash composition also varies by which part of the tree was burnt. Silicon and calcium salts are more abundant in bark than in wood, while potassium salts are primarily found in wood. Compositional variation also occurred based on the season in which the tree died.

==Specific types==
=== Cremation ashes ===
Cremation ashes, also called cremated remains or &quot;cremains,&quot; are the bodily remains left from cremation. They often take the form of a grey powder resembling coarse sand. While often referred to as &quot;ashes&quot;, the remains primarily consist of powdered bone fragments due to the cremation process, which eliminates the body&#x27;s organic materials. People often store these ashes in containers like urns, although they are also sometimes buried or scattered in specific locations.

===Food ashes===
In food processing, mineral and ash content is used to characterize the presence of organic and inorganic components in food for monitoring quality, nutritional quantification and labeling, analyzing microbiological stability, and more. This process can be used to measure minerals like calcium, sodium, potassium, and phosphorus as well as metal content such as lead, mercury, cadmium, and aluminum.

=== Joss paper ash ===
Analysis of the contents of ash samples from Vietnam and Singapore shows that joss paper burning can emit many pollutants detrimental to air quality. There is a significant amount of heavy metals in the dust fume and bottom ash, e.g., aluminium, iron, manganese, copper, lead, zinc and cadmium.

&quot;Burning of joss paper accounted for up to 42% of the atmospheric rBC [refractory black carbon] mass, higher than traffic (14-17%), crop residue (10-17%), coal (18-20%) during the Hanyi festival in northwest China&quot;, according to a 2022 study, &quot;the overall air quality can be worsened due to the practice of uncontrolled burning of joss paper during the festival, which is not just confined to the people who do the burning,&quot; and &quot;burning joss paper during worship activities is common in China and most Asian countries with similar traditions.&quot;

=== Slash-and-burn ash ===

=== Wildfire ash ===
High levels of heavy metals, including lead, arsenic, cadmium, and copper were found in the ash debris following the 2007 Californian wildfires. A national clean-up campaign was organised ... In the devastating California Camp Fire (2018) that killed 85 people, lead levels increased by around 50 times in the hours following the fire at a site nearby (Chico). Zinc concentration also increased significantly in Modesto, 150 miles away. Heavy metals such as manganese and calcium were found in numerous California fires as well.

===Others===
* Ashes from
** Stubble burning
** Open burning of waste
* Cigarette or cigar ash
* Incinerator bottom ash, a form of ash produced in incinerators
* Products of coal combustion
** Bottom ash
** Fly ash
* Volcanic ash, ash that consists of fragmented glass, rock, and minerals that appears during an eruption.
* Wood ash

==Other properties==

==Aging process==

===Global distillation===

==Uses==
===Fertilizer===

Ashes have been used since the Neolithic period as fertilizer because they are rich in minerals, especially potash and essential nutrients. They are the main fertilizer in slash-and-burn agriculture, which eventually evolved into controlled burn and forest clearing practices. People in ancient history already possessed extensive knowledge of the nutrients produced by (from social 10th textbook)(manufacturing industries) different ashes. For clay soil in particular, using ash without modification or using , ash whose minerals have been washed with water, was necessary.

===Laundry===
Because ashes contain potash, they can be used to make biodegradable laundry detergent. The demand for organic products has led to renewed interest for laundry using ash derived from wood. The French word for laundry is from the Latin word , which means a substance made from ash and used to wash laundry. This usage also developed into a small, traditional architectural structure to the west of Rhône mainstem: the , a masonry structure built with stone or cob, that looks like a cabinet and that carries dirty laundry and fireplace ash; when the is full, the laundry and ash are moved to a laundry container and boiled in water.

Laundry using ash derived from wood has the benefit of being free, easy to produce, sustainable, and as efficient as standard laundry washing methods.

==Health effects==

== Effect on precipitation ==
&quot;Particles of dust or smoke in the atmosphere are essential for precipitation. These particles, called &#x27;condensation nuclei,&#x27; provide a surface for water vapor to condense upon. This helps water droplets gather together and become large enough to fall to the earth.&quot;

== Effect on climate change ==

<text>In calculus, an antiderivative, inverse derivative, primitive function, primitive integral or indefinite integral of a continuous function is a differentiable function whose derivative is equal to the original function . This can be stated symbolically as . The process of solving for antiderivatives is called antidifferentiation (or indefinite integration), and its opposite operation is called &quot;differentiation&quot;, which is the process of finding a derivative. Antiderivatives are often denoted by capital Roman letters such as and .

Antiderivatives are related to definite integrals through the second fundamental theorem of calculus: the definite integral of a function over a closed interval where the function is Riemann integrable is equal to the difference between the values of an antiderivative evaluated at the endpoints of the interval.

In physics, antiderivatives arise in the context of rectilinear motion (e.g., in explaining the relationship between position, velocity and acceleration). The discrete equivalent of the notion of antiderivative is antidifference.

==Examples==
The function formula_1 is an antiderivative of formula_2, since the derivative of formula_3 is formula_4. Since the derivative of a constant is zero, formula_4 will have an infinite number of antiderivatives, such as formula_6, etc. Thus, all the antiderivatives of formula_4 can be obtained by changing the value of in formula_8, where is an arbitrary constant known as the constant of integration. The graphs of antiderivatives of a given function are vertical translations of each other, with each graph&#x27;s vertical location depending upon the value .

More generally, the power function formula_9 has antiderivative formula_10 if , and formula_11 if .

In physics, the integration of acceleration yields velocity plus a constant. The constant is the initial velocity term that would be lost upon taking the derivative of velocity, because the derivative of a constant term is zero. This same pattern applies to further integrations and derivatives of motion (position, velocity, acceleration, and so on). Thus, integration produces the relations of acceleration, velocity and displacement:
formula_12

==Uses and properties==
Antiderivatives can be used to compute definite integrals, using the fundamental theorem of calculus: if is an antiderivative of the continuous function over the interval formula_13, then:
formula_14

Because of this, each of the infinitely many antiderivatives of a given function may be called the &quot;indefinite integral&quot; of &quot;f&quot; and written using the integral symbol with no bounds:
formula_15

If is an antiderivative of , and the function is defined on some interval, then every other antiderivative of differs from by a constant: there exists a number such that formula_16 for all . is called the constant of integration. If the domain of is a disjoint union of two or more (open) intervals, then a different constant of integration may be chosen for each of the intervals. For instance
formula_17

is the most general antiderivative of formula_18 on its natural domain formula_19

Every continuous function has an antiderivative, and one antiderivative is given by the definite integral of with variable upper boundary:
formula_20
for any in the domain of . Varying the lower boundary produces other antiderivatives, but not necessarily all possible antiderivatives. This is another formulation of the fundamental theorem of calculus.

There are many elementary functions whose antiderivatives, even though they exist, cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions. Elementary functions are polynomials, exponential functions, logarithms, trigonometric functions, inverse trigonometric functions and their combinations under composition and linear combination. Examples of these nonelementary integrals are

* the error function formula_21
* the Fresnel function formula_22
* the sine integral formula_23
* the logarithmic integral function formula_24 and
* sophomore&#x27;s dream formula_25

For a more detailed discussion, see also Differential Galois theory.

==Techniques of integration==
Finding antiderivatives of elementary functions is often considerably harder than finding their derivatives (indeed, there is no pre-defined method for computing indefinite integrals). For some elementary functions, it is impossible to find an antiderivative in terms of other elementary functions. To learn more, see elementary functions and nonelementary integral.

There exist many properties and techniques for finding antiderivatives. These include, among others:

* The linearity of integration (which breaks complicated integrals into simpler ones)
* Integration by substitution, often combined with trigonometric identities or the natural logarithm
* The inverse chain rule method (a special case of integration by substitution)
* Integration by parts (to integrate products of functions)
* Inverse function integration (a formula that expresses the antiderivative of the inverse of an invertible and continuous function , in terms of and the antiderivative of ).
* The method of partial fractions in integration (which allows us to integrate all rational functions—fractions of two polynomials)
* The Risch algorithm
* Additional techniques for multiple integrations (see for instance double integrals, polar coordinates, the Jacobian and the Stokes&#x27; theorem)
* Numerical integration (a technique for approximating a definite integral when no elementary antiderivative exists, as in the case of )
* Algebraic manipulation of integrand (so that other integration techniques, such as integration by substitution, may be used)
*Cauchy formula for repeated integration (to calculate the -times antiderivative of a function) formula_26

Computer algebra systems can be used to automate some or all of the work involved in the symbolic techniques above, which is particularly useful when the algebraic manipulations involved are very complex or lengthy. Integrals which have already been derived can be looked up in a table of integrals.

==Of non-continuous functions==
Non-continuous functions can have antiderivatives. While there are still open questions in this area, it is known that:
* Some highly pathological functions with large sets of discontinuities may nevertheless have antiderivatives.
* In some cases, the antiderivatives of such pathological functions may be found by Riemann integration, while in other cases these functions are not Riemann integrable.

Assuming that the domains of the functions are open intervals:

* A necessary, but not sufficient, condition for a function to have an antiderivative is that have the intermediate value property. That is, if is a subinterval of the domain of and is any real number between and , then there exists a between and such that . This is a consequence of Darboux&#x27;s theorem.
* The set of discontinuities of must be a meagre set. This set must also be an F-sigma set (since the set of discontinuities of any function must be of this type). Moreover, for any meagre F-sigma set, one can construct some function having an antiderivative, which has the given set as its set of discontinuities.
* If has an antiderivative, is bounded on closed finite subintervals of the domain and has a set of discontinuities of Lebesgue measure 0, then an antiderivative may be found by integration in the sense of Lebesgue. In fact, using more powerful integrals like the Henstock–Kurzweil integral, every function for which an antiderivative exists is integrable, and its general integral coincides with its antiderivative.
* If has an antiderivative on a closed interval formula_13, then for any choice of partition formula_28 if one chooses sample points formula_29 as specified by the mean value theorem, then the corresponding Riemann sum telescopes to the value formula_30. formula_31 However, if is unbounded, or if is bounded but the set of discontinuities of has positive Lebesgue measure, a different choice of sample points formula_32 may give a significantly different value for the Riemann sum, no matter how fine the partition. See Example 4 below.

<doc id="2824" wikidata="Q931920" url="?curid=2824" title="The ABC Song">
<text>&quot;The ABC Song&quot; is the best-known song used to recite the English alphabet in alphabetical order. It is commonly used to teach the alphabet to children in English-speaking countries. &quot;The ABC Song&quot; was first copyrighted in 1835 by Boston music publisher Charles Bradlee. The melody is from a 1761 French music book and is also used in other nursery rhymes like &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star&quot;, while the author of the lyrics is unknown. Songs set to the same melody are also used to teach the alphabets of other languages.

== History ==
The melody of &quot;The ABC Song&quot; was first published in the French book of music &quot;Les Amusements d&#x27;une Heure et Demy&quot; (&quot;&quot;) (1761) without lyrics. It was adapted in Mozart&#x27;s Twelve Variations and used in many nursery rhymes around the world, including &quot;Ah! vous dirai-je, maman&quot;, &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star&quot; and later &quot;Baa, Baa, Black Sheep&quot;, before being used in this song. The author of the lyrics is unknown.

&quot;The ABC Song&quot; was first copyrighted in 1835 by Boston music publisher Charles Bradlee under the title &quot;The A.B.C., a German air with variations for the flute with an easy accompaniment for the piano forte.&quot; The melody was attributed to 18th-century composer Louis Le Maire.

&quot;The ABC Song&quot; is commonly used in preschools across English-speaking countries. Due to the speed at which &#x27;&quot;L, M, N, O, P&quot;&#x27; is spoken, it is a common misconception among children still learning the alphabet to believe that it is in fact its own letter called &quot;elemenopee&quot;. Some have proposed teaching slower versions of the song to avoid this issue, but attempts to do so have been criticized for lacking the end rhymes and the &quot;&#x27;L, M, N, O, P&quot;&quot; part being an essential part of the song. The television series &quot;Sesame Street&quot; has covered the song many times, collaborating with popular artists such as Stevie Wonder, Katy Perry, Nina Simone and Usher.

=== Pronunciation of &quot;Z&quot; ===
In American English, the dialect in mind by the composer, the letter name for Z is pronounced /ziː/ (&quot;Zee&quot;), but in most other anglophone countries, the letter name is pronounced /zɛd/ (&quot;Zed&quot;). In such dialects, the absent &quot;Zee&quot;-rhyme is generally not missed, although while singing the song, some children may accommodate for &quot;Zee&quot; which they would otherwise not use on a regular basis. Variants of the song exist to accommodate &quot;Zed&quot;. One such variation is shown below:

&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;{ \time 4/4 c&#x27;4 c&#x27; g&#x27; g&#x27; | a&#x27; a&#x27; g&#x27;2 | f&#x27;4 f&#x27; e&#x27; e&#x27; | d&#x27; d&#x27; c&#x27;2 | g&#x27;4 g&#x27; f&#x27; f&#x27; | e&#x27; e&#x27; d&#x27;2 | g&#x27;4 \times 2/3 { f&#x27;8 f&#x27; f&#x27; } e&#x27;4 d&#x27; | c&#x27; r r2 | \bar &quot;|.&quot; } \addlyrics { A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V dub- a- U X Y &quot;Z(ed)&quot; }&lt;/score&gt;
:&quot;a-b-c-d-e-f-g&quot;
:&quot;h-i-j-k-l-m-n&quot;
:&quot;o-p-q-r-s-t-u&quot;
:&quot;v-w-x-y-z(ed)&quot;

This version does not have a closing line, and the tune is modified accordingly. The W is not lengthened in this version.

=== Backwards alphabet ===
Several versions exist covering the alphabet backward, i.e., Z to A. One version is shown below.

:&quot;z-y-x and(/&amp;) w&quot;
:&quot;v-u-t, s-r-q&quot;
:&quot;p-o-n-m-l-k-j&quot;
:&quot;i-h-g-f-e-d-c-b-a&quot;
:&quot;Now you know your ZYXs&quot;
:&quot;I bet that&#x27;s not what you expected!&quot;
The e-d-c-b part is as fast as the l-m-n-o part in the normal alphabet song.

=== Versions for other languages ===
The same melody used for &quot;The ABC Song&quot; has also been used for the German, French, and Arabic alphabets. A French-language version of the song is also taught in Canada, with generally no alterations to the melody except in the final line that requires adjustment to accommodate the two-syllable pronunciation of the French &quot;y&quot;.

<text>The Antigonid dynasty (; ) was a Macedonian Greek royal house which ruled the kingdom of Macedon during the Hellenistic period. Founded by Antigonus I Monophthalmus, a general and successor of Alexander the Great, the dynasty first came to power after the Battle of Salamis in 306 BC and ruled much of Hellenistic Greece from 294 until their defeat at the Battle of Pydna in 168 BC (Third Macedonian War), after which Macedon came under the control of the Roman Republic. 

The wars of the Diadochi witnessed the fall of the Argead dynasty in Macedon resulting in a power vacuum, which the Antigonid and Antipatrid dynasties sought to occupy. The Antigonid family first rose to power when Demetrius I Poliorcetes, son of Antigonus I, ousted Cassander&#x27;s governor of Athens in 306 BC giving his father control over a land spanning from the Aegean Sea to the Middle East. Despite the subsequent instability and loss of the Asian territory, the family managed to maintain its power in mainland Greece and the islands, with Antigonus II Gonatas ultimately solidifying Antigonid rule over Hellenistic Macedon –a territory also known as the Antigonid Empire. Antigonus III Doson further expanded Macedonian influence in southern Greece reestablishing the Hellenic Alliance with himself as the president. Under Philip V, Antigonid Macedon first came into conflict with Rome, which had become a decisive power in the eastern Mediterranean. In the second century BC, the last Antigonid king, Perseus, became known as the champion of Greek resistance against Rome, albeit Rome&#x27;s control over Antigonid Greece began to steadily expand, culminating in the fall of the dynasty in 168. 

==History==

The beginning of Hellenistic Greece was defined by the struggle between the Antipatrid dynasty, led first by Cassander (r. 305 – 297 BC), son of Antipater, and the Antigonid dynasty, led by Antigonus I Monophthalmus (r. 306 – 301 BC) and his son, the future king Demetrius I Poliorcetes (r. 294 – 288 BC). After the power crisis in Macedon, which culminated in Philip III&#x27;s and Euridice&#x27;s death, Cassander managed to seize control from Olympias and began to establish his authority in the kingdom; in 316 BC he buried Philip III and Euridice at Aegae and married Philip II&#x27;s daughter, Thessalonica, thus becoming a member of the Argead dynasty. In 310/309 BC, Cassander commanded Glaucias to secretly assassinate the 14-year-old Alexander IV, son of Alexander the Great, and his mother Roxane and the Macedonian Argead dynasty became extinct. 

In 307 BC, Demetrius I successfully ousted Cassander&#x27;s governor of Athens, Demetrius of Phalerum, and after defeating Ptolemy I at the Battle of Salamis in 306 BC he conquered the island Cyprus. Following that victory, Demetrius&#x27; father, Antigonus I, assumed the title of &quot;Basileus&quot; (&quot;King&quot; of Alexander&#x27;s Empire) by the assembled armies and gained control over the Aegean, the eastern Mediterranean, and most of the Middle East. While Antigonus and Demetrius attempted to recreate Philip II&#x27;s Hellenic league with themselves as dual hegemons, a revived coalition of Cassander, Ptolemy I Soter, Seleucus I Nicator, and Lysimachus decisively defeated the Antigonids at the Battle of Ipsus in 301 BC, during which Antigonus I was killed. Demetrius I survived the battle and in 294 BC –during the struggles between Casander&#x27;s sons Alexander V and Antipater I– he managed to seize control of Athens and establish himself as king of Macedon. In 288 BC, he was driven out by Pyrrhus and Lysimachus and eventually died as a prisoner of Seleucus I Nicator. After a long period of instability, Demetrius&#x27; son Antigonus II Gonatas was able to establish the family&#x27;s control over the old Kingdom of Macedon, as well as over most of the Greek city-states by 276 BC.

==Legacy==
The Antigonid was one of four dynasties established by Alexander&#x27;s successors, the others being the Seleucid dynasty, Ptolemaic dynasty and Antipatrid dynasty. The last scion of the dynasty, Perseus of Macedon, who reigned between 179 and 168 BC, proved unable to stop the advancing Roman legions and Macedon&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Pydna signaled the end of the dynasty.

==Dynasty==
The ruling members of the Antigonid dynasty were:

The Greek rebel against Rome and last King of Macedonia, Andriscus, claimed to be the son of Perseus.

<doc id="2830" wikidata="Q321794" url="?curid=2830" title="Abjuration">
<text>Abjuration is the solemn repudiation, abandonment, or renunciation by or upon oath, often the renunciation of citizenship or some other right or privilege. The term comes from the Latin &quot;abjurare&quot;, &quot;to forswear&quot;.

==Abjuration of the realm==
Abjuration of the realm was a type of abjuration in ancient English law. The person taking the oath swore to leave the country directly and promptly, never to return to the kingdom unless by permission of the sovereign. This was often taken by fugitives who had taken sanctuary:

==English Commonwealth==
Near the start of the English Civil War, on 18 August 1643 Parliament passed &quot;An Ordinance for Explanation of a former Ordinance for Sequestration of Delinquents Estates with some Enlargements.&quot; The enlargements included an oath which became known as the &quot;Oath of Abjuration&quot;:
In 1656–7, it was reissued in what was for Catholics an even more objectionable form. Everyone was to be &quot;adjudged a Papist&quot; who refused this oath, and the consequent penalties began with the confiscation of two-thirds of the recusant&#x27;s goods, and went on to deprive him of almost every civic right.

The Catholic Encyclopaedia makes the point that the oath and the penalties were so severe that it stopped the efforts of the Gallicanizing party among the English Catholics, who had been ready to offer forms of submission similar to the old oath of Allegiance, which was condemned anew about this time by Pope Innocent X.

==Scotland==

During The Killing Time of the 1680s an Abjuration Oath could be put to suspects where they were given the option to abjure or renounce their allegiances. The terms of the oath were deliberately designed to offend the consciences of the Presbyterian Covenanters. Those who would not swear &quot;whether they have arms, or not&quot; could be &quot;immediately killed&quot; by field trial &quot;before two witnesses&quot; on a charge of high treason. John Brown was included among those executed in this judicial process by John Graham (Bluidy Clavers) on 1 May 1685. The wives and children of such men could also be put out of their houses if they had spoken to the suspect or refused the oath themselves.

==Great Britain and Ireland==
In England (and after 1707 Great Britain) the Oath of Abjuration denied the royal title of James II&#x27;s heirs (i.e. the direct Catholic descendant of the House of Stuart exiled after the Glorious Revolution in 1688). In England, an Oath of Abjuration was taken by Members of Parliament, clergy, and laymen, pledging to support the current British monarch and repudiated the right of the Stuarts and other claimants to the throne. This oath was imposed under William III, George I and George III. It was superseded by the oath of allegiance. In Ireland, the oath was imposed of state officeholders, teachers, lawyers, and on the clergy of the established church in from 1703, the following year it was on all Irish voters and from 1709 it could be demanded of any adult male by a magistrate.

== Bilino Polje abjuration ==

The Bilino Polje abjuration, also known as &quot;Confessio Christianorum bosniensis&quot;, was an act of alleged heresy abjuration by clergy of the Bosnian Church in presence of the Bosnian ruler, Ban Kulin, and Giovanni da Casamari. It affirmed the primacy of the pope and related to errors of practice, stemming from ignorance, rather than heretical doctrines. It was signed by seven Bosnian priors, on 8 April 1203 at Bilino Polje field, near today town of Zenica, in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The same document was brought to Buda, in 30 April by Giovanni da Casamari, Ban Kulin and two abbots, where it was examined by Emeric, King of Hungary, and the high clergy.

==The Netherlands==
Another famous abjuration was brought about by the Plakkaat van Verlatinghe of July 26, 1581, the formal Act of Abjuration or declaration of independence of the Low Countries from the Spanish king, Philip II. This oath was the climax of the Eighty Years&#x27; War (Dutch Revolt).

<doc id="2834" wikidata="Q300646" url="?curid=2834" title="A Vindication of the Rights of Woman">
<text>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman: with Strictures on Political and Moral Subjects (1792), written by British philosopher and women&#x27;s rights advocate Mary Wollstonecraft (1759–1797), is one of the earliest works of feminist philosophy. In it, Wollstonecraft responds to those educational and political theorists of the eighteenth century who did not believe women should receive a rational education. She argues that women ought to have an education commensurate with their position in society, claiming that women are essential to the nation because they educate its children and because they could be &quot;companions&quot; to their husbands, rather than mere wives. Instead of viewing women as ornaments to society or property to be traded in marriage, Wollstonecraft maintains that they are human beings deserving of the same fundamental rights as men.

Wollstonecraft was prompted to write the &quot;Rights of Woman&quot; after reading Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord&#x27;s 1791 report to the French National Assembly, which stated that women should only receive domestic education. From her reaction to this specific event, she launched a broad attack against double standards, indicting men for encouraging women to indulge in excessive emotion. Wollstonecraft hurried to complete the work in direct response to ongoing events; she intended to write a more thoughtful second volume but died before completing it.

While Wollstonecraft does call for equality between the sexes in particular areas of life, especially morality, she does not explicitly state that men and women are equal. Her ambiguous statements regarding the equality of the sexes have made it difficult to classify Wollstonecraft as a modern feminist; the word itself did not emerge until decades after her death.

Although it is commonly assumed that the &quot;Rights of Woman&quot; was unfavourably received, this is a modern misconception based on the belief that Wollstonecraft was as reviled during her lifetime as she became after the publication of William Godwin&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot; (1798). The &quot;Rights of Woman&quot; was generally received well when it was first published in 1792. Biographer Emily W. Sunstein called it &quot;perhaps the most original book of [Wollstonecraft&#x27;s] century&quot;. Wollstonecraft&#x27;s work had significant impact on advocates for women&#x27;s rights in the nineteenth century, particularly the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention which produced the Declaration of Sentiments laying out the aims of the women&#x27;s suffrage movement in the United States.

==Historical context==
&quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot; was written against the tumultuous background of the French Revolution and the debates that it spawned in Britain. In a lively and sometimes vicious pamphlet war, now referred to as the Revolution controversy, British political commentators addressed topics ranging from representative government to human rights to the separation of church and state, many of these issues having been raised in France first. Wollstonecraft first entered this fray in 1790 with &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Men&quot;, a response to Edmund Burke&#x27;s &quot;Reflections on the Revolution in France&quot; (1790). In his &quot;Reflections&quot;, Burke criticized the view of many British thinkers and writers who had welcomed the early stages of the French revolution. While they saw the revolution as analogous to Britain&#x27;s own Glorious Revolution in 1688, which had restricted the powers of the monarchy, Burke argued that the appropriate historical analogy was the English Civil War (1642–1651) in which CharlesI had been executed in 1649. He viewed the French revolution as the violent overthrow of a legitimate government. In &quot;Reflections&quot; he argues that citizens do not have the right to revolt against their government because civilization is the result of social and political consensus; its traditions cannot be continually challengedthe result would be anarchy. One of the key arguments of Wollstonecraft&#x27;s &quot;Rights of Men&quot;, published just six weeks after Burke&#x27;s &quot;Reflections&quot;, is that rights cannot be based on tradition; rights, she argues, should be conferred because they are reasonable and just, regardless of their basis in tradition.

When Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord presented his &quot;Rapport sur l&#x27;instruction publique&quot; (1791) to the National Assembly in France, Wollstonecraft was galvanized to respond. In his recommendations for a national system of education, Talleyrand had written:
Let us bring up women, not to aspire to advantages which the Constitution denies them, but to know and appreciate those which it guarantees them... Men are destined to live on the stage of the world. A public education suits them: it early places before their eyes all the scenes of life: only the proportions are different. The paternal home is better for the education of women; they have less need to learn to deal with the interests of others, than to accustom themselves to a calm and secluded life.
Wollstonecraft dedicated the &quot;Rights of Woman&quot; to Talleyrand: &quot;Having read with great pleasure a pamphlet which you have lately published, I dedicate this volume to you; to induce you to reconsider the subject, and maturely weigh what I have advanced respecting the rights of woman and national education.&quot; At the end of 1791, French feminist Olympe de Gouges had published her Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen, and the question of women&#x27;s rights became central to political debates in both France and Britain.

The &quot;Rights of Woman&quot; is an extension of Wollstonecraft&#x27;s arguments in the &quot;Rights of Men&quot;. In the &quot;Rights of Men&quot;, as the title suggests, she is concerned with the rights of particular men (eighteenth-century British men) while in the &quot;Rights of Woman&quot;, she is concerned with the rights afforded to &quot;woman&quot;, an abstract category. She does not isolate her argument to eighteenth-century women or British women. The first chapter of the &quot;Rights of Woman&quot; addresses the issue of natural rights and asks who has those inalienable rights and on what grounds. She answers that since natural rights are given by God, for one segment of society to deny them to another segment is a sin. &quot;The Rights of Woman&quot; thus engages not only specific events in France and in Britain but also larger questions being raised by political philosophers such as John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

==Themes==
The &quot;Rights of Woman&quot; is a long (almost 87,000 words) essay that introduces all of its major topics in the opening chapters and then repeatedly returns to them, each time from a different point of view. It also adopts a hybrid tone that combines rational argument with the fervent rhetoric of sensibility. Wollstonecraft did not employ the formal argumentation or logical prose style common to eighteenth-century philosophical writing.

Hysteria was once seen as a physical phenomenonphysicians and anatomists believed that the more &quot;sensitive&quot; people&#x27;s &quot;nerves&quot;, the more emotionally affected they would be by their surroundings. Since women were thought to have keener nerves than men, it was believed that women were more emotional than men. The emotional excess associated with sensibility also theoretically produced an ethic of compassion: those with sensibility could easily sympathise with people in pain. Thus historians have credited the discourse of sensibility and those who promoted it with the increased humanitarian efforts, such as the movement to abolish the slave trade. But sensibility also paralysed those who had too much of it; as scholar G. J. Barker-Benfield explains, &quot;an innate refinement of nerves was also identifiable with greater suffering, with weakness, and a susceptibility to disorder&quot;.

By the time Wollstonecraft was writing the &quot;Rights of Woman&quot;, sensibility had already been under sustained attack for a number of years. Sensibility, which had initially promised to draw individuals together through sympathy, was now viewed as &quot;profoundly separatist&quot;; novels, plays, and poems that employed the language of sensibility asserted individual rights, sexual freedom, and unconventional familial relationships based only upon feeling. Furthermore, as Janet Todd, another scholar of sensibility, argues, &quot;to many in Britain the cult of sensibility seemed to have feminized the nation, given women undue prominence, and emasculated men&quot;.

===Rational education===
One of Wollstonecraft&#x27;s central arguments in the &quot;Rights of Woman&quot; is that women should be educated in a rational manner to give them the opportunity to contribute to society. In the eighteenth century, it was often assumed by educational philosophers and conduct book writers, who wrote what one might think of as early self-help books, that women were incapable of rational or abstract thought. Women, it was believed, were too susceptible to sensibility and too fragile to be able to think clearly. Wollstonecraft, along with other female reformers such as Catharine Macaulay and Hester Chapone, maintained that women were indeed capable of rational thought and deserved to be educated. She argued this point in her own conduct book, &quot;Thoughts on the Education of Daughters&quot; (1787), in her children&#x27;s book, &quot;Original Stories from Real Life&quot; (1788), as well as in the &quot;Rights of Woman&quot;.

Stating in her preface that &quot;my main argument is built on this simple principle, that if [woman] be not prepared by education to become the companion of man, she will stop the progress of knowledge and virtue; for truth must be common to all&quot;, Wollstonecraft contends that society will degenerate without educated women, particularly because mothers are the primary educators of young children. She attributes the problem of uneducated women to men and &quot;a false system of education, gathered from the books written on this subject by men who [consider] females rather as women than human creatures&quot;. Women are capable of rationality; it only appears that they are not, because men have refused to educate them and encouraged them to be frivolous (Wollstonecraft describes silly women as &quot;spaniels&quot; and &quot;toys&quot;).

Wollstonecraft attacks conduct book writers such as James Fordyce and John Gregory as well as educational philosophers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau who argue that a woman does not need a rational education. (Rousseau argues in &quot;&quot; [1762] that women should be educated for the pleasure of men; Wollstonecraft, infuriated by this argument, attacks not only it but also Rousseau himself.) Intent on illustrating the limitations that contemporary educational theory placed upon women, Wollstonecraft writes, &quot;taught from their infancy that beauty is woman&#x27;s sceptre, the mind shapes itself to the body, and, roaming round its gilt cage, only seeks to adorn its prison&quot;, implying that without this damaging ideology, which encourages young women to focus their attention on beauty and outward accomplishments, they could achieve much more. Wives could be the rational &quot;companions&quot; of their husbands and even pursue careers should they so choose: &quot;women might certainly study the art of healing, and be physicians as well as nurses. And midwifery, decency seems to to them... they might, also, study politics... Business of various kinds, they might likewise pursue.&quot;

For Wollstonecraft, &quot;the most perfect education&quot; is &quot;an exercise of the understanding as is best calculated to strengthen the body and form the heart. Or, in other words, to enable the individual to attach such habits of virtue as will render it independent.&quot; In addition to her broad philosophical arguments, Wollstonecraft lays out a specific plan for national education to counter Talleyrand&#x27;s. In Chapter 12, &quot;On National Education&quot;, she proposes that children be sent to free day schools as well as given some education at home &quot;to inspire a love of home and domestic pleasures&quot;. She also maintains that schooling should be co-educational, contending that men and women, whose marriages are &quot;the cement of society&quot;, should be &quot;educated after the same model&quot;.

===Feminism===
It is debatable to what extent the &quot;Rights of Woman&quot; is a feminist text; because the definitions of &quot;feminist&quot; vary, different scholars have come to different conclusions. The words &quot;feminist&quot; and &quot;feminism&quot; were not coined until the 1890s, and there was no feminist movement to speak of during Wollstonecraft&#x27;s lifetime. &quot;Rights of Woman&quot; is often considered the source or original, &quot;the ur-document of modern liberal feminism&quot;. In the introduction to her work on Wollstonecraft&#x27;s thought, Barbara Taylor writes:
Describing [Wollstonecraft&#x27;s philosophy] as feminist is problematic, and I do it only after much consideration. The label is of course anachronistic... Treating Wollstonecraft&#x27;s thought as an anticipation of nineteenth and twentieth-century feminist argument has meant sacrificing or distorting some of its key elements. Leading examples of this... have been the widespread neglect of her religious beliefs, and the misrepresentation of her as a bourgeois liberal, which together have resulted in the displacement of a religiously inspired utopian radicalism by a secular, class-partisan reformism as alien to Wollstonecraft&#x27;s political project as her dream of a divinely promised age of universal happiness is to our own. Even more important however has been the imposition on Wollstonecraft of a heroic-individualist brand of politics utterly at odds with her own ethically driven case for women&#x27;s emancipation. Wollstonecraft&#x27;s leading ambition for women was that they should attain virtue, and it was to this end that she sought their liberation.

In the &quot;Rights of Woman&quot;, Wollstonecraft does not make the claim for gender equality using the same arguments or the same language that late nineteenth- and twentieth-century feminists later would. For instance, rather than unequivocally stating that men and women are equal, Wollstonecraft contends that men and women are equal in the eyes of God, which means that they are both subject to the same moral law. For Wollstonecraft, men and women are equal in the most important areas of life. While such an idea may not seem revolutionary to twenty-first-century readers, its implications were revolutionary during the eighteenth century. For example, it implied that both men and womennot just womenshould be modest and respect the sanctity of marriage. Wollstonecraft&#x27;s argument exposed the sexual double standard of the late eighteenth century and demanded that men adhere to the same virtues demanded of women.

However, Wollstonecraft&#x27;s arguments for equality stand in contrast to her statements respecting the superiority of masculine strength and valour. Wollstonecraft states:
Let it not be concluded, that I wish to invert the order of things; I have already granted, that, from the constitution of their bodies, men seem to be designed by Providence to attain a greater degree of virtue. I speak collectively of the whole sex; but I see not the shadow of a reason to conclude that their virtues should differ in respect to their nature. In fact, how can they, if virtue has only one eternal standard? I must therefore, if I reason consequentially, as strenuously maintain that they have the same simple direction, as that there is a God.

Wollstonecraft calls on men, rather than women, to initiate the social and political changes she outlines in the &quot;Rights of Woman&quot;. Because women are uneducated, they cannot alter their own situationmen must come to their aid. Wollstonecraft writes at the end of her chapter &quot;Of the Pernicious Effects Which Arise from the Unnatural Distinctions Established in Society&quot;:
I then would convince reasonable men of the importance of some of my remarks; and prevail on them to weigh dispassionately the whole tenor of my observations... I appeal to their understandings; and, as a fellow-creature, claim, in the name of my sex, some interest in their hearts. I entreat them to assist to emancipate their companion, to make her a help meet for them! Would men but generously snap our chains, and be content with rational fellowship instead of slavish obedience, they would find us more observant daughters, more affectionate sisters, more faithful wives, more reasonable mothersin a word, better citizens.

Wollstonecraft&#x27;s last novel, &quot;&quot; (1798), the fictionalized sequel to the &quot;Rights of Woman&quot;, is usually considered her most radical feminist work.

===Sensibility===
One of Wollstonecraft&#x27;s most scathing criticisms in the &quot;Rights of Woman&quot; is against false and excessive sensibility, particularly in women. She argues that women who succumb to sensibility are &quot;blown about by every momentary gust of feeling&quot;; because these women are &quot;the prey of their senses&quot;, they cannot think rationally. Not only do they do harm to themselves but they also do harm to all of civilization: these are not women who can refine civilizationthese are women who will destroy it. But reason and feeling are not independent for Wollstonecraft; rather, she believes that they should inform each other. For Wollstonecraft the passions underpin all reason. This was a theme that she would return to throughout her career, but particularly in her novels &quot;&quot; (1788) and &quot;&quot;. For the eighteenth-century Scottish philosopher David Hume, reason is dominated by the passions. He held that passions rather than reason govern human behaviour, famously proclaiming in &quot;A Treatise of Human Nature&quot; that &quot;Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions&quot;.

As part of her argument that women should not be overly influenced by their feelings and emotions, Wollstonecraft emphasises that they should not be constrained by or made slaves to their bodies or their sexual feelings. This particular argument has led many modern feminists to suggest that Wollstonecraft intentionally avoids granting women any sexual desire. Cora Kaplan argues that the &quot;negative and prescriptive assault on female sexuality&quot; is a leitmotif of the &quot;Rights of Woman&quot;. For example, Wollstonecraft advises her readers to &quot;calmly let passion subside into friendship&quot; in the ideal companionate marriage (that is, in the ideal of a love-based marriage that was developing at the time). It would be better, she writes, when &quot;two virtuous young people marry . . . if some circumstances checked their passion&quot;. According to Wollstonecraft, &quot;love and friendship cannot subsist in the same bosom&quot;. As Mary Poovey explains, &quot;Wollstonecraft betrays her fear that female desire might in fact court man&#x27;s lascivious and degrading attentions, that the subordinate position women have been given might even be deserved. Until women can transcend their fleshly desires and fleshly forms, they will be hostage to the body.&quot; If women are not interested in sexuality, they cannot be dominated by men. Wollstonecraft worries that women are consumed with &quot;romantic wavering&quot;, that is, they are interested only in satisfying their lusts. Because the &quot;Rights of Woman&quot; eliminates sexuality from a woman&#x27;s life, Kaplan contends, it &quot;expresses a violent antagonism to the sexual&quot; while at the same time &quot;exaggerat[ing] the importance of the sensual in the everyday life of women&quot;. Wollstonecraft was so determined to wipe sexuality from her picture of the ideal woman that she ended up foregrounding it by insisting upon its absence. But as Kaplan and others have remarked, Wollstonecraft may have been forced to make this sacrifice: &quot;it is important to remember that the notion of woman as politically enabled and independent [was] fatally linked [during the eighteenth century] to the unrestrained and vicious exercise of her sexuality.&quot;

===Republicanism===
Claudia Johnson, a prominent Wollstonecraft scholar, has called the &quot;Rights of Woman&quot; &quot;a republican manifesto&quot;. Johnson contends that Wollstonecraft is hearkening back to the Commonwealth tradition of the seventeenth century and attempting to reestablish a republican ethos. In Wollstonecraft&#x27;s version, there would be strong, but separate, masculine and feminine roles for citizens. According to Johnson, Wollstonecraft &quot;denounces the collapse of proper sexual distinction as the leading feature of her age, and as the grievous consequence of sentimentality itself. The problem undermining society in her view is feminized men&quot;. If men feel free to adopt both the masculine position and the sentimental feminine position, she argues, women have no position open to them in society. Johnson therefore sees Wollstonecraft as a critic, in both the &quot;Rights of Men&quot; and the &quot;Rights of Woman&quot;, of the &quot;masculinization of sensitivity&quot; in such works as Edmund Burke&#x27;s &quot;Reflections on the Revolution in France&quot;.

In the &quot;Rights of Woman&quot; Wollstonecraft adheres to a version of republicanism that includes a belief in the eventual overthrow of all titles, including the monarchy. She also suggests that all men and women should be represented in government. But the bulk of her &quot;political criticism&quot;, as Chris Jones, a Wollstonecraft scholar, explains, &quot;is couched predominantly in terms of morality&quot;. Her definition of virtue focuses on the individual&#x27;s happiness rather than, for example, the good of society. This is reflected in her explanation of natural rights. Because rights ultimately proceed from God, Wollstonecraft maintains that there are duties, tied to those rights, incumbent upon each and every person. For Wollstonecraft, the individual is taught republicanism and benevolence within the family; domestic relations and familial ties are crucial to her understanding of social cohesion and patriotism.

===Class===
In many ways the &quot;Rights of Woman&quot; is inflected by a bourgeois view of the world, as is its direct predecessor the &quot;Rights of Men&quot;. Wollstonecraft addresses her text to the middle class, which she calls the &quot;most natural state&quot;. She also frequently praises modesty and industry, virtues which, at the time, were associated with the middle class. From her position as a middle-class writer arguing for a middle-class ethos, Wollstonecraft also attacks the wealthy, criticizing them using the same arguments she employs against women. She points out the &quot;false-refinement, immorality, and vanity&quot; of the rich, calling them &quot;weak, artificial beings, raised above the common wants and affections of their race, in a premature unnatural manner [who] undermine the very foundation of virtue, and spread corruption through the whole mass of society&quot;.

But Wollstonecraft&#x27;s criticisms of the wealthy do not necessarily reflect a concomitant sympathy for the poor. For her, the poor are fortunate because they will never be trapped by the snares of wealth: &quot;Happy is it when people have the cares of life to struggle with; for these struggles prevent their becoming a prey to enervating vices, merely from idleness!&quot; She contends that charity has only negative consequences because, as Jones puts it, she &quot;sees it as sustaining an unequal society while giving the appearance of virtue to the rich&quot;.

In her national plan for education, she retains class distinctions (with an exception for the intelligent), suggesting that: &quot;After the age of nine, girls and boys, intended for domestic employments, or mechanical trades, ought to be removed to other schools, and receive instruction, in some measure appropriated to the destination of each individual... The young people of superior abilities, or fortune, might now be taught, in another school, the dead and living languages, the elements of science, and continue the study of history and politics, on a more extensive scale, which would not exclude polite literature.&quot;

==Rhetoric and style==
In attempting to navigate the cultural expectations of female writers and the generic conventions of political and philosophical discourse, Wollstonecraft, as she does throughout her &quot;&quot;, constructs a unique blend of masculine and feminine styles in the &quot;Rights of Woman&quot;. She uses the language of philosophy, referring to her work as a &quot;treatise&quot; with &quot;arguments&quot; and &quot;principles&quot;. However, Wollstonecraft also uses a personal tone, employing &quot;I&quot; and &quot;you&quot;, dashes and exclamation marks, and autobiographical references to create a distinctly feminine voice in the text. The &quot;Rights of Woman&quot; further hybridizes its genre by weaving together elements of the conduct book, the short essay, and the novel, genres often associated with women, while at the same time claiming that these genres could be used to discuss philosophical topics such as rights.

Although Wollstonecraft argues against excessive sensibility, the rhetoric of the &quot;Rights of Woman&quot; is at times heated and attempts to provoke the reader. Many of the most emotional comments in the book are directed at Rousseau. For example, after excerpting a long passage from &quot;&quot; (1762), Wollstonecraft pithily states, &quot;I shall make no other comments on this ingenious passage, than just to observe, that it is the philosophy of lasciviousness.&quot; A mere page later, after indicting Rousseau&#x27;s plan for female education, she writes &quot;I must relieve myself by drawing another picture.&quot; These terse exclamations are meant to draw the reader to her side of the argument (it is assumed that the reader will agree with them). While she claims to write in a plain style so that her ideas will reach the broadest possible audience, she actually combines the plain, rational language of the political treatise with the poetic, passionate language of sensibility to demonstrate that one can combine rationality and sensibility in the same self.

In her efforts to vividly describe the condition of women within society, Wollstonecraft employs several different analogies. She often compares women to slaves, arguing that their ignorance and powerlessness places them in that position. But at the same time, she also compares them to &quot;capricious tyrants&quot; who use cunning and deceit to manipulate the men around them. At one point, she reasons that a woman can become either a slave or tyrant, which she describes as two sides of the same coin. Wollstonecraft also compares women to soldiers; like military men, they are valued only for their appearance and obedience. And like the rich, women&#x27;s &quot;softness&quot; has &quot;debased mankind&quot;.

==Revision==
Wollstonecraft was forced to write the &quot;Rights of Woman&quot; hurriedly to respond to Talleyrand and ongoing events. Upon completing the work, she wrote to her friend William Roscoe: &quot;I am dissatisfied with myself for not having done justice to the subject... Do not suspect me of false modestyI mean to say that had I allowed myself more time I could have written a better book, in every sense of the word... I intend to finish the next volume before I begin to print, for it is not pleasant to have the Devil coming for the conclusion of a sheet fore it is written.&quot; When Wollstonecraft revised the &quot;Rights of Woman&quot; for the second edition, she took the opportunity not only to fix small spelling and grammar mistakes but also to bolster the feminist claims of her argument. She changed some of her statements regarding female and male difference to reflect a greater equality between the sexes.

Wollstonecraft never wrote the second part to the &quot;Rights of Woman,&quot; although William Godwin published her &quot;Hints&quot;, which were &quot;chiefly designed to have been incorporated in the second part of the &quot;Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot;&quot;, in the posthumous collection of her works. However, she did begin writing the novel &quot;&quot;, which most scholars consider a fictionalized sequel to the &quot;Rights of Woman&quot;. It was unfinished at her death and also included in the &quot;Posthumous Works&quot; published by Godwin.

==Reception and legacy==
When it was first published in 1792, the &quot;Rights of Woman&quot; was reviewed favourably by the &quot;Analytical Review&quot;, the &quot;General Magazine&quot;, the &quot;Literary Magazine&quot;, &quot;New York Magazine&quot;, and the &quot;Monthly Review&quot;, although the assumption persists that &quot;Rights of Woman&quot; received hostile reviews. It was almost immediately released in a second edition in 1792, several American editions appeared, and it was translated into French. Taylor writes that &quot;it was an immediate success&quot;. Moreover, other writers such as Mary Hays and Mary Robinson specifically alluded to Wollstonecraft&#x27;s text in their own works. Hays cited the &quot;Rights of Woman&quot; in her novel &quot;Memoirs of Emma Courtney&quot; (1796) and modelled her female characters after Wollstonecraft&#x27;s ideal woman.

Although female conservatives such as Hannah More excoriated Wollstonecraft personally, they actually shared many of the same values. As the scholar Anne Mellor has shown, both More and Wollstonecraft wanted a society founded on &quot;Christian virtues of rational benevolence, honesty, personal virtue, the fulfillment of social duty, thrift, sobriety, and hard work&quot;. During the early 1790s, many writers within British society were engaged in an intense debate regarding the position of women in society. For example, the respected poet and essayist Anna Laetitia Barbauld and Wollstonecraft sparred back and forth; Barbauld published several poems responding to Wollstonecraft&#x27;s work and Wollstonecraft commented on them in footnotes to the &quot;Rights of Woman&quot;. The work also provoked outright hostility. The bluestocking Elizabeth Carter was unimpressed with the work. Thomas Taylor, the Neoplatonist translator who had been a landlord to the Wollstonecraft family in the late 1770s, swiftly wrote a satire called &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Brutes&quot;: if women have rights, why not animals too?

After Wollstonecraft died in 1797, her husband William Godwin published his &quot;Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot; (1798). He revealed much about her private life that had previously not been known to the public: her illegitimate child, her love affairs, and her attempts at suicide. While Godwin believed he was portraying his wife with love, sincerity, and compassion, contemporary readers were shocked by Wollstonecraft&#x27;s unorthodox lifestyle and she became a reviled figure. Richard Polwhele targeted her in particular in his anonymous long poem &quot;The Unsex&#x27;d Females&quot; (1798), a defensive reaction to women&#x27;s literary self-assertion: Hannah More is Christ to Wollstonecraft&#x27;s Satan. His poem was &quot;well known&quot; among the responses to &quot;A Vindication&quot;.

Wollstonecraft&#x27;s ideas became associated with her life story and women writers felt that it was dangerous to mention her in their texts. Hays, who had previously been a close friend and an outspoken advocate for Wollstonecraft and her &quot;Rights of Woman&quot;, for example, did not include her in the collection of &quot;Illustrious and Celebrated Women&quot; she published in 1803. Maria Edgeworth specifically distances herself from Wollstonecraft in her novel &quot;Belinda&quot; (1802); she caricatures Wollstonecraft as a radical feminist in the character of Harriet Freke. But, like Jane Austen, she does not reject Wollstonecraft&#x27;s ideas. Both Edgeworth and Austen argue that women are crucial to the development of the nation; moreover, they portray women as rational beings who should choose companionate marriage.

The negative views towards Wollstonecraft persisted for over a century. The &quot;Rights of Woman&quot; was not reprinted until the middle of the nineteenth century and it still retained an aura of ill-repute. George Eliot wrote &quot;there is in some quarters a vague prejudice against the &quot;Rights of Woman&quot; as in some way or other a reprehensible book, but readers who go to it with this impression will be surprised to find it eminently serious, severely moral, and withal rather heavy&quot;. The suffragist (i.e. moderate reformer, as opposed to suffragette) Millicent Garrett Fawcett wrote the introduction to the centenary edition of the &quot;Rights of Woman&quot;, cleansing the memory of Wollstonecraft and claiming her as the foremother of the struggle for the vote. While the &quot;Rights of Woman&quot; may have paved the way for feminist arguments, twentieth-century feminists have tended to use Wollstonecraft&#x27;s life story, rather than her texts, for inspiration; her unorthodox lifestyle convinced them to try new &quot;experiments in living&quot;, as Virginia Woolf termed it in her famous essay on Wollstonecraft. However, there is some evidence that the &quot;Rights of Woman&quot; may be influencing current feminists. Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a feminist who is critical of Islam&#x27;s dictates regarding women, cites the &quot;Rights of Woman&quot; in her autobiography &quot;Infidel&quot;, writing that she was &quot;inspired by Mary Wollstonecraft, the pioneering feminist thinker who told women they had the same ability to reason as men did and deserved the same rights&quot;. Miriam Schneir also includes this text in her anthology &quot;&quot;, labelling it as one of the essential feminist works. Further evidence of the enduring legacy of Wollstonecraft&#x27;s &quot;A Vindication&quot; may be seen by direct references in recent historical fiction set: for example, in &quot;The Silk Weaver&quot; (1998) set in the late eighteenth century among Dublin silk weavers, author Gabrielle Warnock (1998) intervenes as narrator to hold up ‘Rights of Woman’ for the reader to reflect upon the politics, morals, and feelings of her female characters. In &quot;Death Comes to Pemberley&quot; (2011), set in 1803, P. D. James has one male character reference &quot;Rights of Woman&quot; in reproving another (Darcy) for denying voice to the woman in matters that concern her.

<text>The Afghan Hound is a hound distinguished by its thick, fine, silky coat, and a tail with a ring curl at the end. The breed originates in the cold mountains of Afghanistan. Its local name is ( ) or ( ). Other names for this breed are Tāzī, Balkh Hound, Baluchi Hound, and Barakzai Hound.

The American Kennel Club (AKC) describes the breed as among the most eye-catching of all. The Afghan Hound is an &quot;aloof and dignified aristocrat of sublime beauty.&quot; Despite their regal appearance, the Afghan possesses an &quot;endearing streak of silliness and a profound loyalty.&quot;

Admired since ancient times for their beauty, the Afghan Hound&#x27;s distinctive coat was developed as protection from the harsh mountain climate. Their huge paw-pads served as shock absorbers on the rocky terrain.

==History==
The Afghan Hound has been identified as a basal breed that predates the emergence of the modern breeds in the 19th century. It is most closely related to the Saluki.
Connections with other types and breeds from the same area may provide clues to the history. A name for a desert coursing Afghan Hound, Tazi (Sag-e-Tazi), suggests a shared ancestry with the very similar Tazy breed from the Caspian Sea area of Russia and Turkmenistan. Other types or breeds of similar appearance are the Taigan from the mountainous Tian Shan region on the Chinese border of Afghanistan, and the Barakzay, or Kurram Valley Hound.

Once out of Afghanistan, the history of the Afghan Hound breed became entwined with that of the very earliest dog shows and the Kennel Club (UK). Various sighthounds were brought to England in the 1800s by army officers returning from British India and were exhibited at dog shows, which were then just becoming popular, under various names, such as Barukzy hounds. They were also called &quot;Persian Greyhounds&quot; by the English, in reference to their own indigenous sighthound.

One dog in particular, Zardin, was brought in 1907 from India by Captain John Barff. Zardin became the early ideal for the breed type still referred to as the Persian Greyhound. Zardin was the basis of the writing for the first breed standard in 1912, but this breeding cycle was stopped by World War I.


Out of the longhaired sighthound types known in Afghanistan, two main strains make up the modern Afghan Hound breed. The first were a group of hounds brought to Scotland from Balochistan by Major and Mrs. G. Bell-Murray and Miss Jean C. Manson in 1920, and they are known as the Bell-Murray strain. These dogs were of the &quot;steppe&quot; or “desert” type and were less heavily coated.

The second strain was a group of dogs from a kennel in Kabul owned by Mrs. Mary Amps, which she shipped to England in 1925. She and her husband came to Kabul after the Afghan war in 1919, and the foundation sire of her kennel (named Ghazni) in Kabul was a dog that closely resembled Zardin. Her Ghazni strain were the more heavily coated mountain type. Most of the Afghans in the United States were developed from the Ghazni strain from England. The first Afghans in Australia were imported from the United States in 1934, also of the Ghazni strain. The mountain and steppe strains became mixed into the modern Afghan Hound breed, and a new standard was written in 1948, which is still used today.

The Afghan Hound can also come with a much more &quot;patterned&quot; coat. This descends from the Bell-Murray&#x27;s and the Ghazni lines, and is displayed in much lighter feathering of coat, deeper saddle (often actually looking like a saddle) and much shorter hair on the face and neck. It is believed that these particular Afghan Hounds were a product of much hotter parts of the country.

The beauty of Afghan Hound dogs caused them to become highly desirable show dogs and pets, and they are recognised by all of the major kennel clubs in the English-speaking world. One of the Amps Ghazni, Sirdar, won best in show at Crufts in 1928 and 1930. An Afghan Hound was featured on the cover of Life Magazine on November 26, 1945. Afghan Hounds were the most popular in Australia in the 1970s, and won most of the major shows. An Afghan Hound won Best in Show (BIS) at the 1996 World Dog Show in Budapest. Afghan Hounds were BIS at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1957 and again in 1983.

The Afghan Hound breed is no longer used for hunting, although it can be seen in the sport of lure coursing.

On August 3, 2005, Korean scientist Hwang Woo-Suk announced that his team of researchers had become the first team to successfully clone a dog, an Afghan Hound named Snuppy. In 2006 Hwang Woo-Suk was dismissed from his university position for fabricating data in his research. Snuppy, nonetheless, was a genuine clone, and thus the first cloned dog in history.

==Description==

The dogs in this breed occur in many different coat colors. A study that mapped the genes of Afghan Hounds and discussed the effect of genes on coat colour in the breed was published in the Journal of Heredity in 2010.

The Afghan Hound is tall, standing in height and weighing . The coat may be any colour, but white markings, particularly on the head, are discouraged; many individuals have a black facial mask. A specimen may have a beard on the lower jaw, known as a &quot;mandarin&quot;. Some Afghan Hounds are almost white, but parti-color hounds (white with islands of red or black) are penalized in the AKC standard, but not by the FCI.

Their long, fine-textured coat requires considerable care and grooming. The long topknot and the shorter-haired saddle on the back of the dog are distinctive features of the Afghan Hound coat. The high hipbones and unique small ring on the end of the tail are also characteristics of the breed.

The temperament of the typical Afghan Hound can be aloof and dignified, but happy and clownish when playing. This breed, as tends to be the case with sighthounds, has a high prey drive and may kill small animals and livestock. Genomic studies have pointed to the Afghan Hound as one of the oldest of dog breeds.

The breed has a reputation among dog trainers of having a relatively slow &quot;obedience intelligence&quot;; Stanley Coren, in his book &quot;The Intelligence of Dogs&quot;, ranked the breed last among 138 breeds mentioned in ability to understand and obey commands, requiring more than 80 repetitions to understand a new command and obeying on the first command less than 25% of the time. Coren noted that Afghan Hounds were consistently ranked among the least obedient dog breeds among all of the trainers he consulted, with a majority (121 out of 199) ranking the Afghan Hound in the lowest ten breeds out of 133 listed.

==Variants==
===Khalag Tazi===
The Khalag Tazi is a variety of the Afghan Hound introduced to Europe in 1920, when an Indian Army officer, Major G Bell-Murray, brought some animals back from Afghanistan.

===Bakhmull===

Bakhmull (also Bakhmull Tazi or Tazi Bakhmull, also called the Aboriginal Afghan Hound) is a long-haired variety of sighthound. It has been bred mostly in Russia and claimed to represent an Afghan Hound aboriginal to Afghanistan. In Pashto the word means &quot;velvet&quot;, applied in reference to the dog&#x27;s silky coat, which is rather abundant and long on the whole body, except the &quot;saddle&quot; (middle to lower back), front parts of all four legs, and the muzzle. Its color is always fawn, ivory, or white, with a darker &quot;saddle&quot;, thus it produces an impression of a (yellowish) dog whose coat color matches the khaki sandstone and limestone of the Hindu Kush mountain landscape and deserts. The following colors are not permissible: red, red with white spots, black, and black with white spots.

Since the 1980s, the centre of Bakhmull breeding has been Russia, beginning in Moscow, then spreading to various other places in the CIS. The foundation stock was brought to Russia in the 1970s by military men returning from Afghanistan. Natalia Gherasiova (a breeder, of the Blue Dale el Bark Bakhmull kennel, and dog show judge) established the National Bakhmull Club, affiliated with the Russian Federation for Hunting Dogs (RFOS) and Russian Kynological Federation (RKF). A breed standard was first published in 1985, and a shared RFOS–RKF revision was produced in 1997.

Bakhmulls hunt solo and in couples. Although its coat is long, it does not require much grooming. Paws are well protected from injuries by &quot;feathering&quot; (thick additional paw fur). Its long, velvety coat and its stamina makes more suitable than many breeds for harsh weather. The breed standard calls for &quot;aristocratic gait and a beautiful head with gazelle-like ... eyes&quot;. The eyes should be large, brown, slanting upwards, and of almond shape, with rims outlined black. Black coloration is required on the nose and lips for both white and fawn bakhmulls. The dog&#x27;s height should be between , for bitches. The height at the withers is higher than at the croup.

==Health==
===Lifespan===
A UK study found a life expectancy of 11.1 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

===Health concerns===
Major health issues are allergies, cancer, and hip dysplasia. Like other sighthounds, the Afghan Hound is sensitive to anesthesia, as sighthounds have relatively low levels of body fat. Afghan Hounds are also among the dog breeds most likely to develop chylothorax, a rare condition which causes the thoracic ducts to leak, allowing large quantities of chyle fluid to enter the dog&#x27;s chest cavity. This condition commonly results in a lung-lobe torsion (in which the dog&#x27;s lung twists within the chest cavity, requiring emergency surgery), due to the breed&#x27;s typically deep, &quot;barrel&quot;-shaped chest. If not corrected through surgery, chylothorax can ultimately cause fibrosing pleuritis, or a hardening of the organs, due to scar tissue forming around the organs to protect them from the chyle fluid. Chylothorax is often fatal.

Among other health problems are laryngeal paralysis, dilated cardiomyopathy (twice as common in males as females), and dermatological issues such as testosterone-responsive dermatosis of male dogs (often seen in castrated males), nasal depigmentation (also known as Dudley nose), and skin tumours. Afghans are also prone to Central diabetes insipidus (CDI), hypothyroidism and tricholemmoma, a rare condition which mainly affects older dogs in the Middle Ages. Ocular conditions that can occur include medial canthal pocket syndrome (breed predisposition due to shape of head), corneal dystrophy, cataract and generalized progressive retinal atrophy (GPRA). Afghan myelopathy (causing pelvic limb ataxia) is sometimes reported.

==In popular culture==

Pablo Picasso said that his 1967 statue located in Chicago&#x27;s Daley Plaza represented the head of an Afghan Hound named Kabul.

The Afghan Hound has been represented in multiple animated feature films and TV shows, including Universal Pictures&#x27; &quot;Balto&quot; (Sylvie), Disney&#x27;s &quot;Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp&#x27;s Adventure&quot; (Ruby), Hasbro Studios&#x27;s &quot;Pound Puppies&quot; (Twiggy) and ABC Kids&#x27; &quot;Bluey&quot; (Indy). An Afghan Hound also appeared in the films &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians,&quot; &quot;101 Dalmatians,&quot; &quot;102 Dalmatians, and 101 Dalmatians II: Patch&#x27;s London Adventure&quot;. Other examples include Prince Amir of Kinjan from &quot;What-a-Mess,&quot; Persia from &quot;Road Rovers,&quot; Burt from &quot;Foofur,&quot; Laila from &quot;Roadside Romeo,&quot; and Brainy Barker from &quot;Krypto the Superdog&quot;. Malory Archer in the show &quot;Archer&quot; also had an Afghan Hound named Duchess at some point in her childhood.

In the 1941 novel &quot;Between the Acts&quot;, Virginia Woolf uses an Afghan Hound named Sohrab to represent aspects of one of the book&#x27;s human characters.

The Afghan Hound features prominently in the avant-garde music video of French band M83&#x27;s, &quot;Set in Stone (M83 Remix)&quot;.

<text>The Azawakh is a breed of dog from West Africa. With ancient origins, it is raised throughout the Sahelian zone of Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso. This region includes the Azawagh Valley for which the breed is named. While commonly associated with the nomadic Tuareg people, the dogs are also bred and owned by other ethnic groups, such as the Peulh, Bella, and Hausa. The Azawakh is more related to the Sloughi than it is to the Saluki.

==Description==
===Appearance===
Slim and elegant, with bone structure and muscles showing through thin skin. Eyes are almond-shaped.

The coat is very short and almost absent on the belly. Its bone structure shows clearly through the skin and musculature. Its muscles are &quot;dry&quot;, meaning that they are quite flat, unlike the Greyhound and Whippet. In this respect it is similar in type to the Saluki.

===Colours===
Colours permitted by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI) breed standard are clear sand to dark fawn/brown, red and brindle (with or without a dark mask), with white bib, tail tip, and white on all feet (which can be tips of toes to high stockings). Since 2015 white stockings that go above the elbow joint are considered disqualifying features in the FCI member countries, as is a white collar or half collar (Irish marked).

Some conservationists support the idea that in Africa, Azawakhs are still found in a variety of colours such as red, blue fawn (that is, with a lilac cast), grizzle, and, rarely, blue and black with various white markings including Irish marked (white collar) and particolour (mostly white). Because of this wide color variation in the native population, the American standard used by the AKC and UKC allows any color combination found in Africa.

===Movement===

The Azawakh&#x27;s light, supple, lissome gait is a notable breed characteristic, as is an upright double suspension gallop.
==Temperament==
Bred by the Tuareg, Fula and various other nomads of the Sahara and sub-Saharan Sahel in the countries of Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, and southern Algeria, the breed known by the tuaregs as ”Oska” was used there as a guard dog and to hunt gazelle and hare at speeds up to . The austerity of the Sahel environment has ensured that only the most fit dogs survive and has accentuated the breed&#x27;s ruggedness and independence. Unlike some other sighthounds, the Azawakh is more of a pack hunter and they bump down the quarry with hindquarters when it has been tired out. In role of a guard dog, if an Azawakh senses danger it will bark to alert the other members of the pack, and they will gather together as a pack under the lead of the alpha dog, then chase off or attack the predator. 

Unlike other sighthounds, the primary function of the Azawakh in its native land is that of a guard dog. It develops an intense bond with its owner, and tend to be reserved with strangers.

Azawakh have high energy and tremendous endurance. They are excellent training companions for runners. Many Azawakh dislike rain and cold weather.

Azawakh are pack oriented and form complex social hierarchies. They have tremendous memories and are able to recognize each other after long periods of separation. They can often be found sleeping on top of each other for warmth and companionship.

==Breed history==
The breed is relatively uncommon in Europe and North America but there is a growing band of devotees. Azawakh may be registered with the FCI in the USA via the Federación Canófila de Puerto Rico (FCPR). European FCI clubs and the AKC recognize the FCPR as an acceptable registry. The AKC recognized the Azawakh a member of the Hound group in 2019. The American Azawakh Association (AAA) is the AKC Parent Club for the Azawakh. Azawakh may be registered with the UKC and ARBA. The breed is not yet registered by CKC. Azawakh are eligible for ASFA and AKC lure coursing and NOFCA open field coursing events.

<text>Acrylic paint is a fast-drying paint made of pigment suspended in acrylic polymer emulsion and plasticizers, silicone oils, defoamers, stabilizers, or metal soaps. Most acrylic paints are water-based, but become water-resistant when dry. Depending on how much the paint is diluted with water, or modified with acrylic gels, mediums, or pastes, the finished acrylic painting can resemble a watercolor, a gouache, or an oil painting, or it may have its own unique characteristics not attainable with other media.

Water-based acrylic paints are used as latex house paints, as latex is the technical term for a suspension of polymer microparticles in water. Interior latex house paints tend to be a combination of binder (sometimes acrylic, vinyl, PVA, and others), filler, pigment, and water. Exterior latex house paints may also be a co-polymer blend, but the best exterior water-based paints are 100% acrylic, because of its elasticity and other factors. Vinyl, however, costs half of what 100% acrylic resins cost, and polyvinyl acetate (PVA) is even cheaper, so paint companies make many different combinations of them to match the market.

== History ==

German chemist Otto Röhm invented acrylic resin, which led to the development of acrylic paint. In 1934, the first usable acrylic resin dispersion was developed by German chemical company BASF, and patented by Rohm and Haas. The synthetic paint was first used in the 1940s, displaying some properties of both oil and watercolor. Between 1946 and 1949, Leonard Bocour and Sam Golden invented a solution acrylic paint under the brand Magna paint. These were mineral spirit-based paints.

Water-based acrylic paints were subsequently sold as latex house paints.

Soon after the water-based acrylic binders were introduced as house paints, both individual artists and companies began to explore the new binders. Mexican mural painters like Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and José Clemente Orozco were among the first to experiment with acrylic paint, impressed with its durability. Politec Acrylic Artists&#x27; Colors, water based acrylics useful for mural painting, started being produced and distributed in Mexico in 1953 by both individuals and companies. These acrylic paints began to phase out oil paint in mural art and abstract expressionism. 

Over the 1960s Lancelot Ribeiro pioneered the use of acrylic paints for art in the UK because of his &quot;increasing impatience&quot; of the time it took for oil paints to dry, as also its &quot;lack of brilliance in its colour potential.&quot; He took to the new synthetic plastic bases that commercial paints were beginning to use and soon got help from manufacturers like ICI, Courtaulds, and Geigy. The companies supplied him samples of their latest paints in quantities that he was using three decades later, according to the paper. Initially, the firms thought the PVA compounds would not be needed in commercially viable quantities. But they quickly recognised the potential demand and &quot;so Ribeiro became the godfather of generations of artists using acrylics as an alternative to oils.&quot;

In 1956, José L. Gutiérrez produced &quot;Politec Acrylic Artists&#x27; Colors&quot; in Mexico, and Henry Levison of Cincinnati-based Permanent Pigments Co. produced Liquitex colors. These two product lines were the first acrylic emulsion artists&#x27; paints, with modern high-viscosity paints becoming available in the early 1960s. Meanwhile, on the other side of the globe, 1958 saw the inception of Vynol Paints Pty Ltd (now Derivan) in Australia, who started producing a water-based artist acrylic called Vynol Colour, followed by Matisse Acrylics in the 1960s. Following that development, Golden came up with a waterborne acrylic paint called &quot;Aquatec&quot;. In 1963, George Rowney (part of Daler-Rowney since 1983) was the first manufacturer to introduce artists&#x27; acrylic paints in Europe, under the brand name &quot;Cryla&quot;.

== Painting with acrylics ==
Acrylic painters can modify the appearance, hardness, flexibility, texture, and other characteristics of the paint surface by using acrylic medium or simply by adding water. Watercolor and oil painters also use various mediums, but the range of acrylic mediums is much greater. Acrylics have the ability to bond to many different surfaces, and mediums can be used to modify their binding characteristics. Acrylics can be used on paper, canvas, and a range of other materials; however, their use on engineered woods such as medium-density fiberboard can be problematic because of the porous nature of those surfaces. In these cases, it is recommended that the surface first be sealed with an appropriate sealer. The process of sealing acrylic painting is called varnishing. Artists use removable varnishes over isolation coat to protect paintings from dust, UV, scratches, etc. This process is similar to varnishing an oil painting.

Acrylics can be applied in thin layers or washes to create effects that resemble watercolors and other water-based mediums. They can also be used to build thick layers of paint — gel and molding paste are sometimes used to create paintings with relief features. Acrylic paints are also used in hobbies such as trains, cars, houses, DIY projects, and human models. People who make such models use acrylic paint to build facial features on dolls or raised details on other types of models. Wet acrylic paint is easily removed from paintbrushes and skin with water, whereas oil paints require the use of a hydrocarbon.

Acrylics are the most common paints used in grattage, a surrealist technique that began to be used with the advent of this type of paint. Acrylics are used for this purpose because they easily scrape or peel from a surface.

=== Painting techniques ===

Acrylic artists&#x27; paints may be thinned with water or acrylic medium and used as washes in the manner of watercolor paints, but unlike watercolor the washes are not rehydratable once dry. For this reason, acrylics do not lend themselves to the color lifting techniques of gum arabic-based watercolor paints. Instead, the paint is applied in layers, sometimes diluting with water or acrylic medium to allow layers underneath to partially show through. Using an acrylic medium gives the paint more of a rich and glossy appearance, whereas using water makes the paint look more like watercolor and have a matte finish.

Acrylic paints with gloss or matte finishes are common, although a satin (semi-matte) sheen is most common. Some brands exhibit a range of finishes (e.g. heavy-body paints from Golden, Liquitex, Winsor &amp; Newton and Daler-Rowney); Politec acrylics are fully matte. As with oils, pigment amounts and particle size or shape can affect the paint sheen. Matting agents can also be added during manufacture to dull the finish. If desired, the artist can mix different media with their paints and use topcoats or varnishes to alter or unify sheen.

When dry, acrylic paint is generally non-removable from a solid surface if it adheres to the surface. Water or mild solvents do not re-solubilize it, although isopropyl alcohol can lift some fresh paint films off. Toluene and acetone can remove paint films, but they do not lift paint stains very well and are not selective. The use of a solvent to remove paint may result in removal of all of the paint layers (acrylic gesso, et cetera). Oils and warm, soapy water can remove acrylic paint from skin. Acrylic paint can be removed from nonporous plastic surfaces such as miniatures or models using cleaning products such as Dettol (containing chloroxylenol 4.8% v/w).

An acrylic sizing should be used to prime canvas in preparation for painting with acrylic paints, to prevent Support Induced Discoloration (SID). Acrylic paint contains surfactants that can pull up discoloration from a raw canvas, especially in transparent glazed or translucent gelled areas. Gesso alone will not stop SID; a sizing must be applied before using a gesso.

The viscosity of acrylic can be successfully reduced by using suitable extenders that maintain the integrity of the paint film. There are retarders to slow drying and extend &quot;workability&quot; time, and &quot;flow releases&quot; to increase color-blending ability.

== Properties==

===Grades===

Commercial acrylic paints come in two grades by manufacturers:
* Artist acrylics (professional acrylics) are created and designed to resist chemical reactions from exposure to water, ultraviolet light, and oxygen. Professional-grade acrylics have the most pigment, which allows for more medium manipulation and limits the color shift when mixed with other colors or after drying.
* Student acrylics have working characteristics similar to artist acrylics, but with lower pigment concentrations, less-expensive formulas, and fewer available colors. More expensive pigments are generally replicated by hues. Colors are designed to be mixed even though color strength is lower. Hues may not have exactly the same mixing characteristics as full-strength colors.

=== Varieties ===
*Heavy body acrylics are typically found in the Artist and Student Grade paints. &quot;Heavy Body&quot; refers to the viscosity or thickness of the paint. They are the best choice for impasto or heavier paint applications and will hold a brush or knife stroke and even a medium stiff peak. Gel Mediums (&quot;pigment-less paints&quot;) are also available in various viscosities and used to thicken or thin paints, as well as extend paints and add transparency.
**Examples of Heavy Body Acrylics are Matisse Structure Acrylic Colors, Lukas Pastos Acrylics, Liquitex Heavy Body Acrylics and Golden Heavy Body Acrylics. 
*Medium viscosity acrylics – Fluid acrylics, Soft body acrylics, or High Flow acrylics – have a lower viscosity but generally the same pigmentation as the Heavy Body acrylics. Available in either Artist quality or Craft quality, the cost and quality vary accordingly. These paints are good for watercolor techniques, airbrush application, or when smooth coverage is desired. Fluid acrylics can be mixed with any medium to thicken them for impasto work, or to thin them for glazing applications.
**Examples of fluid acrylics include Lukascryl Liquid, Lukascryl Studio, Liquitex Soft Body and Golden Fluid acrylics. 
*Open acrylics were created to address the one major difference between oil and acrylic paints: the shortened time it takes acrylic paints to dry. Designed by Golden Artist Colors, Inc. with a hydrophilic acrylic resin, these paints can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days, or even weeks, to dry completely, depending on paint thickness, support characteristics, temperature, and humidity. 
*Iridescent, pearl and interference acrylic colors combine conventional pigments with powdered mica (aluminium silicate) or powdered bronze to achieve complex visual effects. Colors have shimmering or reflective characteristics, depending on the coarseness or fineness of the powder. Iridescent colors are used in fine arts and crafts. 
*Acrylic gouache is like traditional gouache because it dries to a matte, opaque finish. However, unlike traditional gouache, the acrylic binder makes it water-resistant once it dries. Like craft paint, it will adhere to a variety of surfaces, not only canvas and paper. This paint is typically used by water-colorists, cartoonists, or illustrators, and for decorative or folk art applications.
**Examples of acrylic gouache are Lascaux Gouache and Turner Acryl Gouache. 
*Craft acrylics can be used on surfaces besides canvas, such as wood, metal, fabrics, and ceramics. They are used in decorative painting techniques and faux finishes to decorate objects of ordinary life. Although colors can be mixed, pigments are often not specified. Each color line is formulated instead to achieve a wide range of premixed colors. Craft paints usually employ vinyl or PVA resins to increase adhesion and lower cost. 
*Interactive acrylics are all-purpose acrylic artists&#x27; colors which have the characteristic fast-drying nature of artists&#x27; acrylics, but are formulated to allow artists to delay drying when they need more working time, or re-wet their work when they want to do more wet blending.
*Exterior acrylics are paints that can withstand outdoor conditions. Like craft acrylics, they adhere to many surfaces. They are more resistant to both water and ultraviolet light. This makes them the acrylic of choice for architectural murals, outdoor signs, and many faux-finishing techniques.
*Acrylic glass paint is water-based and semi-permanent, making it a suitable paint for temporary displays on glass windows.
*Acrylic enamel paint creates a smooth, hard shell. It can be oven-baked or air dried. It can be permanent if kept away from harsh conditions such as dishwashing.

=== Differences between acrylic and oil paint ===

The vehicle and binder of oil paints is linseed oil (or another drying oil), whereas acrylic paint has water as the vehicle for an emulsion (suspension) of acrylic polymer, which serves as the binder. Thus, oil paint is said to be &quot;oil-based&quot;, whereas acrylic paint is &quot;water-based&quot; (or sometimes &quot;water-borne&quot;).

The main practical difference between most acrylics and oil paints is the inherent drying time. Oils allow for more time to blend colors and apply even glazes over underpaintings. This slow-drying aspect of oil can be seen as an advantage for certain techniques, but it impedes an artist trying to work quickly. The fast evaporation of water from regular acrylic paint films can be slowed with the use of acrylic retarders. Retarders are generally glycol or glycerin-based additives. The addition of a retarder slows the evaporation rate of the water.

Oil paints may require the use of solvents such as mineral spirits or turpentine to thin the paint and clean up. These solvents generally have some level of toxicity and can be found objectionable. Relatively recently, water-miscible oil paints have been developed for artists&#x27; use. Oil paint films can gradually yellow and lose their flexibility over time creating cracks in the paint film; the &quot;fat over lean&quot; rule must be observed to ensure its durability.

Oil paint has a higher pigment load than acrylic paint. As linseed oil contains a smaller molecule than acrylic paint, oil paint is able to absorb substantially more pigment. Oil provides a refractive index that is less clear than acrylic dispersions, which imparts a unique &quot;look and feel&quot; to the resultant paint film. Not all the pigments of oil paints are available in acrylics and vice versa, as each medium has different chemical sensitivities. Some historical pigments are alkali sensitive, and therefore cannot be made in an acrylic emulsion; others are just too difficult to formulate. Approximate &quot;hue&quot; color formulations, that do not contain the historical pigments, are typically offered as substitutes.

Because of acrylic paint&#x27;s more flexible nature and more consistent drying time between layers, an artist does not have to follow the same rules of oil painting, where more medium must be applied to each layer to avoid cracking. It usually takes 10–20 minutes for one to two layers of acrylic paint to dry, depending on the brand, quality, and humidity levels of the surrounding environment. Some professional grades of acrylic paint can take 20–30 minutes or even more than an hour. Although canvas needs to be properly primed before painting with oils to prevent the paint medium from eventually rotting the canvas, acrylic can be safely applied straight to the canvas. The rapid drying of acrylic paint tends to discourage blending of color and use of wet-in-wet technique as in oil painting. Even though acrylic retarders can slow drying time to several hours, it remains a relatively fast-drying medium and adding too much acrylic retarder can prevent the paint from ever drying properly.

Meanwhile, acrylic paint is very elastic, which prevents cracking from occurring. Acrylic paint&#x27;s binder is acrylic polymer emulsion – as this binder dries, the paint remains flexible.

Another difference between oil and acrylic paints is the versatility offered by acrylic paints. Acrylics are very useful in mixed media, allowing the use of pastel (oil and chalk), charcoal and pen (among others) on top of the dried acrylic painted surface. Mixing other bodies into the acrylic is possible—sand, rice, and even pasta may be incorporated in the artwork. Mixing artist or student grade acrylic paint with household acrylic emulsions is possible, allowing the use of premixed tints straight from the tube or tin, and thereby presenting the painter with a vast color range at their disposal. This versatility is also illustrated by the variety of additional artistic uses for acrylics. Specialized acrylics have been manufactured and used for linoblock printing (acrylic block printing ink has been produced by Derivan since the early 1980s), face painting, airbrushing, watercolor-like techniques, and fabric screen printing.

Another difference between oil and acrylic paint is the cleanup. Acrylic paint can be cleaned out of a brush with any soap, while oil paint needs a specific type to be sure to get all the oil out of the brushes. Also, it is easier to let a palette with oil paint dry and then scrape the paint off, whereas one can easily clean wet acrylic paint with water.

=== Difference between acrylic and watercolor paint ===
The biggest difference is that acrylic paint is opaque, whereas watercolor paint is translucent in nature. Watercolors take about 5 to 15 minutes to dry while acrylics take about 10 to 20 minutes. In order to change the tone or shade of a watercolor pigment, one changes the percentage of water mixed in to the color. For brighter colors, one adds more water. For darker colors, one adds less water. In order to create lighter or darker colors with acrylic paints, one adds white or black.

Another difference is that watercolors must be painted onto a porous surface, primarily watercolor paper. Acrylic paints can be used on many different surfaces.

Both acrylic and watercolor are easy to clean up with water. Acrylic paint should be cleaned with soap and water immediately following use. Watercolor paint can be cleaned with just water.

<doc id="2839" wikidata="Q161254" url="?curid=2839" title="Angular momentum">
<text>Angular momentum (sometimes called moment of momentum or rotational momentum) is the rotational analog of linear momentum. It is an important physical quantity because it is a conserved quantity – the total angular momentum of a closed system remains constant. Angular momentum has both a direction and a magnitude, and both are conserved. Bicycles and motorcycles, flying discs, rifled bullets, and gyroscopes owe their useful properties to conservation of angular momentum. Conservation of angular momentum is also why hurricanes form spirals and neutron stars have high rotational rates. In general, conservation limits the possible motion of a system, but it does not uniquely determine it.

The three-dimensional angular momentum for a point particle is classically represented as a pseudovector , the cross product of the particle&#x27;s position vector (relative to some origin) and its momentum vector; the latter is in Newtonian mechanics. Unlike linear momentum, angular momentum depends on where this origin is chosen, since the particle&#x27;s position is measured from it.

Angular momentum is an extensive quantity; that is, the total angular momentum of any composite system is the sum of the angular momenta of its constituent parts. For a continuous rigid body or a fluid, the total angular momentum is the volume integral of angular momentum density (angular momentum per unit volume in the limit as volume shrinks to zero) over the entire body.

Similar to conservation of linear momentum, where it is conserved if there is no external force, angular momentum is conserved if there is no external torque. Torque can be defined as the rate of change of angular momentum, analogous to force. The net &quot;external&quot; torque on any system is always equal to the &quot;total&quot; torque on the system; the sum of all internal torques of any system is always 0 (this is the rotational analogue of Newton&#x27;s third law of motion). Therefore, for a closed system (where there is no net external torque), the &quot;total&quot; torque on the system must be 0, which means that the total angular momentum of the system is constant.

The change in angular momentum for a particular interaction is called angular impulse, sometimes twirl. Angular impulse is the angular analog of (linear) impulse.

== Examples ==
The trivial case of the angular momentum formula_1 of a body in an orbit is given by
formula_2
where formula_3 is the mass of the orbiting object, formula_4 is the orbit&#x27;s frequency and formula_5 is the orbit&#x27;s radius.

The angular momentum formula_1 of a uniform rigid sphere rotating around its axis, instead, is given by
formula_7
where formula_3 is the sphere&#x27;s mass, formula_4 is the frequency of rotation and formula_5 is the sphere&#x27;s radius.

Thus, for example, the orbital angular momentum of the Earth with respect to the Sun is about 2.66 × 1040 kg⋅m2⋅s−1, while its rotational angular momentum is about 7.05 × 1033 kg⋅m2⋅s−1.

In the case of a uniform rigid sphere rotating around its axis, if, instead of its mass, its density is known, the angular momentum formula_1 is given by
formula_12
where formula_13 is the sphere&#x27;s density, formula_4 is the frequency of rotation and formula_5 is the sphere&#x27;s radius.

In the simplest case of a spinning disk, the angular momentum formula_1 is given by
formula_17
where formula_3 is the disk&#x27;s mass, formula_4 is the frequency of rotation and formula_5 is the disk&#x27;s radius.

If instead the disk rotates about its diameter (e.g. coin toss), its angular momentum formula_1 is given by
formula_22

== Definition in classical mechanics ==
Just as for angular velocity, there are two special types of angular momentum of an object: the spin angular momentum is the angular momentum about the object&#x27;s center of mass, while the orbital angular momentum is the angular momentum about a chosen center of rotation. The Earth has an orbital angular momentum by nature of revolving around the Sun, and a spin angular momentum by nature of its daily rotation around the polar axis. The total angular momentum is the sum of the spin and orbital angular momenta. In the case of the Earth the primary conserved quantity is the total angular momentum of the solar system because angular momentum is exchanged to a small but important extent among the planets and the Sun. The orbital angular momentum vector of a point particle is always parallel and directly proportional to its orbital angular velocity vector ω, where the constant of proportionality depends on both the mass of the particle and its distance from origin. The spin angular momentum vector of a rigid body is proportional but not always parallel to the spin angular velocity vector Ω, making the constant of proportionality a second-rank tensor rather than a scalar.

=== Orbital angular momentum in two dimensions ===
Angular momentum is a vector quantity (more precisely, a pseudovector) that represents the product of a body&#x27;s rotational inertia and rotational velocity (in radians/sec) about a particular axis. However, if the particle&#x27;s trajectory lies in a single plane, it is sufficient to discard the vector nature of angular momentum, and treat it as a scalar (more precisely, a pseudoscalar). Angular momentum can be considered a rotational analog of linear momentum. Thus, where linear momentum is proportional to mass and linear speed 
formula_23
angular momentum is proportional to moment of inertia and angular speed measured in radians per second.
formula_24

Unlike mass, which depends only on amount of matter, moment of inertia depends also on the position of the axis of rotation and the distribution of the matter. Unlike linear velocity, which does not depend upon the choice of origin, orbital angular velocity is always measured with respect to a fixed origin. Therefore, strictly speaking, should be referred to as the angular momentum &quot;relative to that center&quot;.

In the case of circular motion of a single particle, we can use formula_25 and formula_26 to expand angular momentum as formula_27 reducing to:
formula_28

the product of the radius of rotation and the linear momentum of the particle formula_29, where formula_30 is the linear (tangential) speed.

This simple analysis can also apply to non-circular motion if one uses the component of the motion perpendicular to the radius vector:
formula_31
where formula_32 is the perpendicular component of the motion. Expanding, formula_33 rearranging, formula_34 and reducing, angular momentum can also be expressed,
formula_35
where formula_36 is the length of the &quot;moment arm&quot;, a line dropped perpendicularly from the origin onto the path of the particle. It is this definition, , to which the term &quot;moment of momentum&quot; refers.

=== Scalar angular momentum from Lagrangian mechanics ===
Another approach is to define angular momentum as the conjugate momentum (also called canonical momentum) of the angular coordinate formula_37 expressed in the Lagrangian of the mechanical system. Consider a mechanical system with a mass formula_38 constrained to move in a circle of radius formula_5 in the absence of any external force field. The kinetic energy of the system is
formula_40

And the potential energy is
formula_41

Then the Lagrangian is
formula_42

The &quot;generalized momentum&quot; &quot;canonically conjugate to&quot; the coordinate formula_37 is defined by
formula_44

=== Orbital angular momentum in three dimensions ===
To completely define orbital angular momentum in three dimensions, it is required to know the rate at which the position vector sweeps out angle, the direction perpendicular to the instantaneous plane of angular displacement, and the mass involved, as well as how this mass is distributed in space. By retaining this vector nature of angular momentum, the general nature of the equations is also retained, and can describe any sort of three-dimensional motion about the center of rotation – circular, linear, or otherwise. In vector notation, the orbital angular momentum of a point particle in motion about the origin can be expressed as:
formula_45
where
* formula_25 is the moment of inertia for a point mass,
* formula_47 is the orbital angular velocity of the particle about the origin,
* formula_48 is the position vector of the particle relative to the origin, and formula_49,
* formula_50 is the linear velocity of the particle relative to the origin, and
* formula_38 is the mass of the particle.

This can be expanded, reduced, and by the rules of vector algebra, rearranged:
formula_52
which is the cross product of the position vector formula_48 and the linear momentum formula_54 of the particle. By the definition of the cross product, the formula_55 vector is perpendicular to both formula_48 and formula_57. It is directed perpendicular to the plane of angular displacement, as indicated by the right-hand rule – so that the angular velocity is seen as counter-clockwise from the head of the vector. Conversely, the formula_55 vector defines the plane in which formula_48 and formula_57 lie.

By defining a unit vector formula_61 perpendicular to the plane of angular displacement, a scalar angular speed formula_62 results, where
formula_63 and
formula_64 where formula_65 is the perpendicular component of the motion, as above.

The two-dimensional scalar equations of the previous section can thus be given direction:
formula_66
and formula_67 for circular motion, where all of the motion is perpendicular to the radius formula_5.

In the spherical coordinate system the angular momentum vector expresses as
: formula_69

== Analogy to linear momentum ==
Angular momentum can be described as the rotational analog of linear momentum. Like linear momentum it involves elements of mass and displacement. Unlike linear momentum it also involves elements of position and shape.

Many problems in physics involve matter in motion about some certain point in space, be it in actual rotation about it, or simply moving past it, where it is desired to know what effect the moving matter has on the point—can it exert energy upon it or perform work about it? Energy, the ability to do work, can be stored in matter by setting it in motion—a combination of its inertia and its displacement. Inertia is measured by its mass, and displacement by its velocity. Their product,
formula_70
is the matter&#x27;s momentum. Referring this momentum to a central point introduces a complication: the momentum is not applied to the point directly. For instance, a particle of matter at the outer edge of a wheel is, in effect, at the end of a lever of the same length as the wheel&#x27;s radius, its momentum turning the lever about the center point. This imaginary lever is known as the &quot;moment arm&quot;. It has the effect of multiplying the momentum&#x27;s effort in proportion to its length, an effect known as a &quot;moment&quot;. Hence, the particle&#x27;s momentum referred to a particular point,
formula_71
is the &quot;angular momentum&quot;, sometimes called, as here, the &quot;moment of momentum&quot; of the particle versus that particular center point. The equation formula_72 combines a moment (a mass formula_38 turning moment arm formula_5) with a linear (straight-line equivalent) speed formula_75. Linear speed referred to the central point is simply the product of the distance formula_5 and the angular speed formula_62 versus the point: formula_78 another moment. Hence, angular momentum contains a double moment: formula_79 Simplifying slightly, formula_80 the quantity formula_81 is the particle&#x27;s moment of inertia, sometimes called the second moment of mass. It is a measure of rotational inertia.

The above analogy of the translational momentum and rotational momentum can be expressed in vector form:
* formula_82 for linear motion
* formula_83 for rotation

The direction of momentum is related to the direction of the velocity for linear movement. The direction of angular momentum is related to the angular velocity of the rotation.

Because moment of inertia is a crucial part of the spin angular momentum, the latter necessarily includes all of the complications of the former, which is calculated by multiplying elementary bits of the mass by the squares of their distances from the center of rotation. Therefore, the total moment of inertia, and 
the angular momentum, is a complex function of the configuration of the matter about the center of rotation and the orientation of the rotation for the various bits.

For a rigid body, for instance a wheel or an asteroid, the orientation of rotation is simply the position of the rotation axis versus the matter of the body. It may or may not pass through the center of mass, or it may lie completely outside of the body. For the same body, angular momentum may take a different value for every possible axis about which rotation may take place. It reaches a minimum when the axis passes through the center of mass.

For a collection of objects revolving about a center, for instance all of the bodies of the Solar System, the orientations may be somewhat organized, as is the Solar System, with most of the bodies&#x27; axes lying close to the system&#x27;s axis. Their orientations may also be completely random.

In brief, the more mass and the farther it is from the center of rotation (the longer the moment arm), the greater the moment of inertia, and therefore the greater the angular momentum for a given angular velocity. In many cases the moment of inertia, and hence the angular momentum, can be simplified by,
formula_84where formula_85 is the radius of gyration, the distance from the axis at which the entire mass formula_38 may be considered as concentrated.

Similarly, for a point mass formula_38 the moment of inertia is defined as,
formula_88where formula_5 is the radius of the point mass from the center of rotation, and for any collection of particles formula_90 as the sum,
formula_91

Angular momentum&#x27;s dependence on position and shape is reflected in its units versus linear momentum: kg⋅m2/s or N⋅m⋅s for angular momentum versus kg⋅m/s or N⋅s for linear momentum. When calculating angular momentum as the product of the moment of inertia times the angular velocity, the angular velocity must be expressed in radians per second, where the radian assumes the dimensionless value of unity. (When performing dimensional analysis, it may be productive to use orientational analysis which treats radians as a base unit, but this is not done in the International system of units). The units if angular momentum can be interpreted as torque⋅time. An object with angular momentum of can be reduced to zero angular velocity by an angular impulse of .

The plane perpendicular to the axis of angular momentum and passing through the center of mass is sometimes called the &quot;invariable plane&quot;, because the direction of the axis remains fixed if only the interactions of the bodies within the system, free from outside influences, are considered. One such plane is the invariable plane of the Solar System.

=== Angular momentum and torque ===

Newton&#x27;s second law of motion can be expressed mathematically,
formula_92
or force = mass × acceleration. The rotational equivalent for point particles may be derived as follows:
formula_93
which means that the torque (i.e. the time derivative of the angular momentum) is
formula_94

Because the moment of inertia is formula_95, it follows that formula_96, and formula_97 which, reduces to
formula_98
This is the rotational analog of Newton&#x27;s second law. Note that the torque is not necessarily proportional or parallel to the angular acceleration (as one might expect). The reason for this is that the moment of inertia of a particle can change with time, something that cannot occur for ordinary mass.

== Conservation of angular momentum ==

=== General considerations ===
A rotational analog of Newton&#x27;s third law of motion might be written, &quot;In a closed system, no torque can be exerted on any matter without the exertion on some other matter of an equal and opposite torque about the same axis.&quot; Hence, &quot;angular momentum can be exchanged between objects in a closed system, but total angular momentum before and after an exchange remains constant (is conserved)&quot;.

Seen another way, a rotational analogue of Newton&#x27;s first law of motion might be written, &quot;A rigid body continues in a state of uniform rotation unless acted upon by an external influence.&quot; Thus &quot;with no external influence to act upon it, the original angular momentum of the system remains constant&quot;.

The conservation of angular momentum is used in analyzing &quot;central force motion&quot;. If the net force on some body is directed always toward some point, the &quot;center&quot;, then there is no torque on the body with respect to the center, as all of the force is directed along the radius vector, and none is perpendicular to the radius. Mathematically, torque formula_99 because in this case formula_48 and formula_101 are parallel vectors. Therefore, the angular momentum of the body about the center is constant. This is the case with gravitational attraction in the orbits of planets and satellites, where the gravitational force is always directed toward the primary body and orbiting bodies conserve angular momentum by exchanging distance and velocity as they move about the primary. Central force motion is also used in the analysis of the Bohr model of the atom.

For a planet, angular momentum is distributed between the spin of the planet and its revolution in its orbit, and these are often exchanged by various mechanisms. The conservation of angular momentum in the Earth–Moon system results in the transfer of angular momentum from Earth to Moon, due to tidal torque the Moon exerts on the Earth. This in turn results in the slowing down of the rotation rate of Earth, at about 65.7 nanoseconds per day, and in gradual increase of the radius of Moon&#x27;s orbit, at about 3.82 centimeters per year.

The conservation of angular momentum explains the angular acceleration of an ice skater as they bring their arms and legs close to the vertical axis of rotation. By bringing part of the mass of their body closer to the axis, they decrease their body&#x27;s moment of inertia. Because angular momentum is the product of moment of inertia and angular velocity, if the angular momentum remains constant (is conserved), then the angular velocity (rotational speed) of the skater must increase.

The same phenomenon results in extremely fast spin of compact stars (like white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes) when they are formed out of much larger and slower rotating stars.

Conservation is not always a full explanation for the dynamics of a system but is a key constraint. For example, a spinning top is subject to gravitational torque making it lean over and change the angular momentum about the nutation axis, but neglecting friction at the point of spinning contact, it has a conserved angular momentum about its spinning axis, and another about its precession axis. Also, in any planetary system, the planets, star(s), comets, and asteroids can all move in numerous complicated ways, but only so that the angular momentum of the system is conserved.

Noether&#x27;s theorem states that every conservation law is associated with a symmetry (invariant) of the underlying physics. The symmetry associated with conservation of angular momentum is rotational invariance. The fact that the physics of a system is unchanged if it is rotated by any angle about an axis implies that angular momentum is conserved.

=== Relation to Newton&#x27;s second law of motion ===

While angular momentum total conservation can be understood separately from Newton&#x27;s laws of motion as stemming from Noether&#x27;s theorem in systems symmetric under rotations, it can also be understood simply as an efficient method of calculation of results that can also be otherwise arrived at directly from Newton&#x27;s second law, together with laws governing the forces of nature (such as Newton&#x27;s third law, Maxwell&#x27;s equations and Lorentz force). Indeed, given initial conditions of position and velocity for every point, and the forces at such a condition, one may use Newton&#x27;s second law to calculate the second derivative of position, and solving for this gives full information on the development of the physical system with time. Note, however, that this is no longer true in quantum mechanics, due to the existence of particle spin, which is angular momentum that cannot be described by the cumulative effect of point-like motions in space.

As an example, consider decreasing of the moment of inertia, e.g. when a figure skater is pulling in their hands, speeding up the circular motion. In terms of angular momentum conservation, we have, for angular momentum &quot;L&quot;, moment of inertia &quot;I&quot; and angular velocity &quot;ω&quot;:
formula_102

Using this, we see that the change requires an energy of:
formula_103
so that a decrease in the moment of inertia requires investing energy.

This can be compared to the work done as calculated using Newton&#x27;s laws. Each point in the rotating body is accelerating, at each point of time, with radial acceleration of:
formula_104

Let us observe a point of mass &quot;m&quot;, whose position vector relative to the center of motion is perpendicular to the z-axis at a given point of time, and is at a distance &quot;z&quot;. The centripetal force on this point, keeping the circular motion, is:
formula_105

Thus the work required for moving this point to a distance &quot;dz&quot; farther from the center of motion is:
formula_106

For a non-pointlike body one must integrate over this, with &quot;m&quot; replaced by the mass density per unit &quot;z&quot;. This gives:
formula_107
which is exactly the energy required for keeping the angular momentum conserved.

Note, that the above calculation can also be performed per mass, using kinematics only. Thus the phenomena of figure skater accelerating tangential velocity while pulling their hands in, can be understood as follows in layman&#x27;s language: The skater&#x27;s palms are not moving in a straight line, so they are constantly accelerating inwards, but do not gain additional speed because the accelerating is always done when their motion inwards is zero. However, this is different when pulling the palms closer to the body: The acceleration due to rotation now increases the speed; but because of the rotation, the increase in speed does not translate to a significant speed inwards, but to an increase of the rotation speed.

=== Stationary-action principle ===
In classical mechanics it can be shown that the rotational invariance of action functionals implies conservation of angular momentum. The action is defined in classical physics as a functional of positions, formula_108 often represented by the use of square brackets, and the final and initial times. It assumes the following form in cartesian coordinates:formula_109where the repeated indices indicate summation over the index. If the action is invariant of an infinitesimal transformation, it can be mathematically stated as: formula_110.

Under the transformation, formula_111, the action becomes:
formula_112
where we can employ the expansion of the terms up-to first order in formula_113:
formula_114giving the following change in action:
formula_115

Since all rotations can be expressed as matrix exponential of skew-symmetric matrices, i.e. as formula_116 where formula_117 is a skew-symmetric matrix and formula_118 is angle of rotation, we can express the change of coordinates due to the rotation formula_119, up-to first order of infinitesimal angle of rotation, formula_120 as:
formula_121

Combining the equation of motion and rotational invariance of action, we get from the above equations that:formula_122Since this is true for any matrix formula_123 that satisfies formula_124 it results in the conservation of the following quantity:
formula_125
as formula_126. This corresponds to the conservation of angular momentum throughout the motion.

=== Lagrangian formalism ===
In Lagrangian mechanics, angular momentum for rotation around a given axis, is the conjugate momentum of the generalized coordinate of the angle around the same axis. For example, formula_127, the angular momentum around the z axis, is:
formula_128
where formula_129 is the Lagrangian and formula_130 is the angle around the z axis.

Note that formula_131, the time derivative of the angle, is the angular velocity formula_132. Ordinarily, the Lagrangian depends on the angular velocity through the kinetic energy: The latter can be written by separating the velocity to its radial and tangential part, with the tangential part at the x-y plane, around the z-axis, being equal to:
formula_133
where the subscript i stands for the i-th body, and &quot;m&quot;, &quot;v&quot;&quot;T&quot; and &quot;ω&quot;&quot;z&quot; stand for mass, tangential velocity around the z-axis and angular velocity around that axis, respectively.

For a body that is not point-like, with density &quot;ρ&quot;, we have instead:
formula_134
where integration runs over the area of the body, and &quot;I&quot;z is the moment of inertia around the z-axis.

Thus, assuming the potential energy does not depend on &quot;ω&quot;&quot;z&quot; (this assumption may fail for electromagnetic systems), we have the angular momentum of the &quot;i&quot;th object:
formula_135

We have thus far rotated each object by a separate angle; we may also define an overall angle &quot;θ&quot;z by which we rotate the whole system, thus rotating also each object around the z-axis, and have the overall angular momentum:
formula_136

From Euler–Lagrange equations it then follows that:
formula_137

Since the lagrangian is dependent upon the angles of the object only through the potential, we have:
formula_138
which is the torque on the &quot;i&quot;th object.

Suppose the system is invariant to rotations, so that the potential is independent of an overall rotation by the angle &quot;θ&quot;z (thus it may depend on the angles of objects only through their differences, in the form formula_139). We therefore get for the total angular momentum:
formula_140
And thus the angular momentum around the z-axis is conserved.

This analysis can be repeated separately for each axis, giving conversation of the angular momentum vector. However, the angles around the three axes cannot be treated simultaneously as generalized coordinates, since they are not independent; in particular, two angles per point suffice to determine its position. While it is true that in the case of a rigid body, fully describing it requires, in addition to three translational degrees of freedom, also specification of three rotational degrees of freedom; however these cannot be defined as rotations around the Cartesian axes (see Euler angles). This caveat is reflected in quantum mechanics in the non-trivial commutation relations of the different components of the angular momentum operator.

=== Hamiltonian formalism ===
Equivalently, in Hamiltonian mechanics the Hamiltonian can be described as a function of the angular momentum. As before, the part of the kinetic energy related to rotation around the z-axis for the &quot;i&quot;th object is:
formula_141
which is analogous to the energy dependence upon momentum along the z-axis, formula_142.

Hamilton&#x27;s equations relate the angle around the z-axis to its conjugate momentum, the angular momentum around the same axis:
formula_143

The first equation gives
formula_144

And so we get the same results as in the Lagrangian formalism.

Note, that for combining all axes together, we write the kinetic energy as:
formula_145 is tiny by everyday standards, about 10−34 J s, and therefore this quantization does not noticeably affect the angular momentum of macroscopic objects. However, it is very important in the microscopic world. For example, the structure of electron shells and subshells in chemistry is significantly affected by the quantization of angular momentum.

Quantization of angular momentum was first postulated by Niels Bohr in his model of the atom and was later predicted by Erwin Schrödinger in his Schrödinger equation.

=== Uncertainty ===
In the definition formula_146, six operators are involved: The position operators formula_147, formula_148, formula_149, and the momentum operators formula_150, formula_151, formula_152. However, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle tells us that it is not possible for all six of these quantities to be known simultaneously with arbitrary precision. Therefore, there are limits to what can be known or measured about a particle&#x27;s angular momentum. It turns out that the best that one can do is to simultaneously measure both the angular momentum vector&#x27;s magnitude and its component along one axis.

The uncertainty is closely related to the fact that different components of an angular momentum operator do not commute, for example formula_153. (For the precise commutation relations, see angular momentum operator.)

=== Total angular momentum as generator of rotations ===
As mentioned above, orbital angular momentum L is defined as in classical mechanics: formula_146, but &quot;total&quot; angular momentum J is defined in a different, more basic way: J is defined as the &quot;generator of rotations&quot;. More specifically, J is defined so that the operator
formula_155
is the rotation operator that takes any system and rotates it by angle formula_37 about the axis formula_157. (The &quot;exp&quot; in the formula refers to operator exponential.) To put this the other way around, whatever our quantum Hilbert space is, we expect that the rotation group SO(3) will act on it. There is then an associated action of the Lie algebra so(3) of SO(3); the operators describing the action of so(3) on our Hilbert space are the (total) angular momentum operators.

The relationship between the angular momentum operator and the rotation operators is the same as the relationship between Lie algebras and Lie groups in mathematics. The close relationship between angular momentum and rotations is reflected in Noether&#x27;s theorem that proves that angular momentum is conserved whenever the laws of physics are rotationally invariant.

== Angular momentum in electrodynamics ==
When describing the motion of a charged particle in an electromagnetic field, the canonical momentum P (derived from the Lagrangian for this system) is not gauge invariant. As a consequence, the canonical angular momentum L = r × P is not gauge invariant either. Instead, the momentum that is physical, the so-called &quot;kinetic momentum&quot; (used throughout this article), is (in SI units)
formula_158
where &quot;e&quot; is the electric charge of the particle and A the magnetic vector potential of the electromagnetic field. The gauge-invariant angular momentum, that is &quot;kinetic angular momentum&quot;, is given by
formula_159

The interplay with quantum mechanics is discussed further in the article on canonical commutation relations.

== Angular momentum in optics ==
In &quot;classical Maxwell electrodynamics&quot; the Poynting vector
is a linear momentum density of electromagnetic field.
formula_160

The angular momentum density vector formula_161 is given by a vector product
as in classical mechanics:
formula_162

The above identities are valid &quot;locally&quot;, i.e. in each space point formula_48 in a given moment formula_164.

== Angular momentum in nature and the cosmos ==

Tropical cyclones and other related weather phenomena involve conservation of angular momentum in order to explain the dynamics. Winds revolve slowly around low pressure systems, mainly due to the coriolis effect. If the low pressure intensifies and the slowly circulating air is drawn toward the center, the molecules must speed up in order to conserve angular momentum. By the time they reach the center, the speeds become destructive.

Johannes Kepler determined the laws of planetary motion without knowledge of conservation of momentum. However, not long after his discovery their derivation was determined from conservation of angular momentum. Planets move more slowly the further they are out in their elliptical orbits, which is explained intuitively by the fact that orbital angular momentum is proportional to the radius of the orbit. Since the mass does not change and the angular momentum is conserved, the velocity drops.

Tidal acceleration is an effect of the tidal forces between an orbiting natural satellite (e.g. the Moon) and the primary planet that it orbits (e.g. Earth). The gravitational torque between the Moon and the tidal bulge of Earth causes the Moon to be constantly promoted to a slightly higher orbit (~3.8 cm per year) and Earth to be decelerated (by −25.858 ± 0.003″/cy²) in its rotation (the length of the day increases by ~1.7 ms per century, +2.3 ms from tidal effect and −0.6 ms from post-glacial rebound). The Earth loses angular momentum which is transferred to the Moon such that the overall angular momentum is conserved.

== Angular momentum in engineering and technology ==

Examples of using conservation of angular momentum for practical advantage are abundant. In engines such as steam engines or internal combustion engines, a flywheel is needed to efficiently convert the lateral motion of the pistons to rotational motion.

Inertial navigation systems explicitly use the fact that angular momentum is conserved with respect to the inertial frame of space. Inertial navigation is what enables submarine trips under the polar ice cap, but are also crucial to all forms of modern navigation.

Rifled bullets use the stability provided by conservation of angular momentum to be more true in their trajectory. The invention of rifled firearms and cannons gave their users significant strategic advantage in battle, and thus were a technological turning point in history.

== History ==
Isaac Newton, in the &quot;Principia&quot;, hinted at angular momentum in his examples of the first law of motion,A top, whose parts by their cohesion are perpetually drawn aside from rectilinear motions, does not cease its rotation, otherwise than as it is retarded by the air. The greater bodies of the planets and comets, meeting with less resistance in more free spaces, preserve their motions both progressive and circular for a much longer time.He did not further investigate angular momentum directly in the &quot;Principia&quot;, saying:From such kind of reflexions also sometimes arise the circular motions of bodies about their own centers. But these are cases which I do not consider in what follows; and it would be too tedious to demonstrate every particular that relates to this subject.However, his geometric proof of the law of areas is an outstanding example of Newton&#x27;s genius, and indirectly proves angular momentum conservation in the case of a central force.

=== Law of Areas ===
==== Newton&#x27;s derivation ====
As a planet orbits the Sun, the line between the Sun and the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time. This had been known since Kepler expounded his second law of planetary motion. Newton derived a unique geometric proof, and went on to show that the attractive force of the Sun&#x27;s gravity was the cause of all of Kepler&#x27;s laws.

During the first interval of time, an object is in motion from point A to point B. Undisturbed, it would continue to point c during the second interval. When the object arrives at B, it receives an impulse directed toward point S. The impulse gives it a small added velocity toward S, such that if this were its only velocity, it would move from B to V during the second interval. By the rules of velocity composition, these two velocities add, and point C is found by construction of parallelogram BcCV. Thus the object&#x27;s path is deflected by the impulse so that it arrives at point C at the end of the second interval. Because the triangles SBc and SBC have the same base SB and the same height Bc or VC, they have the same area. By symmetry, triangle SBc also has the same area as triangle SAB, therefore the object has swept out equal areas SAB and SBC in equal times.

At point C, the object receives another impulse toward S, again deflecting its path during the third interval from d to D. Thus it continues to E and beyond, the triangles SAB, SBc, SBC, SCd, SCD, SDe, SDE all having the same area. Allowing the time intervals to become ever smaller, the path ABCDE approaches indefinitely close to a continuous curve.

Note that because this derivation is geometric, and no specific force is applied, it proves a more general law than Kepler&#x27;s second law of planetary motion. It shows that the Law of Areas applies to any central force, attractive or repulsive, continuous or non-continuous, or zero.

==== Conservation of angular momentum in the law of areas ====
The proportionality of angular momentum to the area swept out by a moving object can be understood by realizing that the bases of the triangles, that is, the lines from S to the object, are equivalent to the radius, and that the heights of the triangles are proportional to the perpendicular component of velocity. Hence, if the area swept per unit time is constant, then by the triangular area formula , the product and therefore the product are constant: if and the base length are decreased, and height must increase proportionally. Mass is constant, therefore angular momentum is conserved by this exchange of distance and velocity.

In the case of triangle SBC, area is equal to (SB)(VC). Wherever C is eventually located due to the impulse applied at B, the product (SB)(VC), and therefore remain constant. Similarly so for each of the triangles.

Another areal proof of conservation of angular momentum for any central force uses Mamikon&#x27;s sweeping tangents theorem.

=== After Newton ===
Leonhard Euler, Daniel Bernoulli, and Patrick d&#x27;Arcy all understood angular momentum in terms of conservation of areal velocity, a result of their analysis of Kepler&#x27;s second law of planetary motion. It is unlikely that they realized the implications for ordinary rotating matter.

In 1736 Euler, like Newton, touched on some of the equations of angular momentum in his &quot;Mechanica&quot; without further developing them.

Bernoulli wrote in a 1744 letter of a &quot;moment of rotational motion&quot;, possibly the first conception of angular momentum as we now understand it.

In 1799, Pierre-Simon Laplace first realized that a fixed plane was associated with rotation—his &quot;invariable plane&quot;.

Louis Poinsot in 1803 began representing rotations as a line segment perpendicular to the rotation, and elaborated on the &quot;conservation of moments&quot;.

In 1852 Léon Foucault used a gyroscope in an experiment to display the Earth&#x27;s rotation.

William J. M. Rankine&#x27;s 1858 &quot;Manual of Applied Mechanics&quot; defined angular momentum in the modern sense for the first time:... a line whose length is proportional to the magnitude of the angular momentum, and whose direction is perpendicular to the plane of motion of the body and of the fixed point, and such, that when the motion of the body is viewed from the extremity of the line, the radius-vector of the body seems to have right-handed rotation.In an 1872 edition of the same book, Rankine stated that &quot;The term &quot;angular momentum&quot; was introduced by Mr. Hayward,&quot; probably referring to R.B. Hayward&#x27;s article &quot;On a Direct Method of estimating Velocities, Accelerations, and all similar Quantities with respect to Axes moveable in any manner in Space with Applications,&quot; which was introduced in 1856, and published in 1864. Rankine was mistaken, as numerous publications feature the term starting in the late 18th to early 19th centuries. However, Hayward&#x27;s article apparently was the first use of the term and the concept seen by much of the English-speaking world. Before this, angular momentum was typically referred to as &quot;momentum of rotation&quot; in English.

<doc id="2840" wikidata="Q274116" url="?curid=2840" title="Plum pudding model">
<text>The plum pudding model is an obsolete scientific model of the atom. It was first proposed by J. J. Thomson in 1904 following his discovery of the electron in 1897, and was rendered obsolete by Ernest Rutherford&#x27;s discovery of the atomic nucleus in 1911. The model tried to account for two properties of atoms then known: that there are electrons, and that atoms have no net electric charge. Logically there had to be an equal amount of positive charge to balance out the negative charge of the electrons. As Thomson had no idea as to the source of this positive charge, he tentatively proposed that it was everywhere in the atom, and that the atom was spherical. This was the mathematically simplest hypothesis to fit the available evidence, or lack thereof. In such a sphere, the negatively charged electrons would distribute themselves in a more or less even manner throughout the volume, simultaneously repelling each other while being attracted to the positive sphere&#x27;s center.

Despite Thomson&#x27;s efforts, his model couldn&#x27;t account for emission spectra and valencies. Based on experimental studies of alpha particle scattering (in the gold foil experiment), Ernest Rutherford developed an alternative model for the atom featuring a compact nucleus where the positive charge is concentrated.

Thomson&#x27;s model is popularly referred to as the &quot;plum pudding model&quot; with the notion that the electrons are distributed uniformly like raisins in a plum pudding. Neither Thomson nor his colleagues ever used this analogy. It seems to have been coined by popular science writers to make the model easier to understand for the layman. The analogy is perhaps misleading because Thomson likened the positive sphere to a liquid rather than a solid since he thought the electrons moved around in it.

==Significance==
Thomson&#x27;s model was the first atomic model to describe an internal structure. Before this, atoms were simply the basic units of weight by which the chemical elements combined, and their only properties were valency and relative weight to hydrogen. The model had no properties which concerned physicists, such as electric charge, magnetic moment, volume, or absolute mass, and because of this some physicists had doubted atoms even existed.

Thomson hypothesized that the quantity, arrangement, and motions of electrons in the atom could explain its physical and chemical properties, such as emission spectra, valencies, reactivity, and ionization. He was on the right track, though his approach was based on classical mechanics and he did not have the insight to incorporate quantized energy into it.

== Background ==

Throughout the 19th century evidence from chemistry and statistical mechanics accumulated that matter was composed of atoms. The structure of the atom was discussed, and by the end of the century the leading model was the vortex theory of the atom, proposed by William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) in 1867. By 1890, J.J. Thomson had his own version called the &quot;nebular atom&quot; hypothesis, in which atoms were composed of immaterial vortices and suggested similarities between the arrangement of vortices and periodic regularity found among the chemical elements.

Thomson&#x27;s discovery of the electron in 1897 changed his views. Thomson called them &quot;corpuscles&quot; (particles), but they were more commonly called &quot;electrons&quot;, the name G. J. Stoney had coined for the &quot;fundamental unit quantity of electricity&quot; in 1891. However even late in 1899, few scientists believed in subatomic particles.

Another emerging scientific theme of the 19th century was the discovery and study of radioactivity. Thomson discovered the electron by studying cathode rays, and in 1900 Henri Becquerel determined that the radiation from uranium, now called beta particles, had the same charge/mass ratio as cathode rays. These beta particles were believed to be electrons travelling at high speed. The particles were used by Thomson to probe atoms to find evidence for his atomic theory. The other form of radiation critical to this era of atomic models was alpha particles. Heavier and slower than beta particles, these were the key tool used by Rutherford to find evidence against Thomson&#x27;s model.

In addition to the emerging atomic theory, the electron, and radiation, the last element of history was the many studies of atomic spectra published in the late 19th century. Part of the attraction of the vortex model was its possible role in describing the spectral data as vibrational responses to electromagnetic radiation. Neither Thomson&#x27;s model nor its successor, Rutherford&#x27;s model, made progress towards understanding atomic spectra. That would have to wait until Niels Bohr built the first quantum-based atom model.

==Development==
Thomson&#x27;s model was the first to assign a specific inner structure to an atom, though his earliest descriptions did not include mathematical formulas.
From 1897 through 1913, Thomson proposed a series of increasingly detailed &quot;polyelectron&quot; models for the atom. His first versions were qualitative culminating in his 1906 paper and follow on summaries. Thomson&#x27;s model changed over the course of its initial publication, finally becoming a model with much more mobility containing electrons revolving in the dense field of positive charge rather than a static structure. Thomson attempted unsuccessfully to reshape his model to account for some of the major spectral lines experimentally known for several elements.

===1897 Corpuscles inside atoms===
In a paper titled &quot;Cathode Rays&quot;, Thomson demonstrated that cathode rays are not light but made of negatively charged particles which he called &quot;corpuscles&quot;. He observed that cathode rays can be deflected by electric and magnetic fields, which does not happen with light rays. In a few paragraphs near the end of this long paper Thomson discusses the possibility that atoms were made of these &quot;corpuscles&quot;, calling them &quot;primordial atoms&quot;. Thomson believed that the intense electric field around the cathode caused the surrounding gas molecules to split up into their component &quot;corpuscles&quot;, thereby generating cathode rays. Thomson thus showed evidence that atoms were divisible, though he did not attempt to describe their structure at this point.

Thomson notes that he was not the first scientist to propose that atoms are divisible, making reference to William Prout who in 1815 found that the atomic weights of various elements were multiples of hydrogen&#x27;s atomic weight and hypothesised that all atoms were made of hydrogen atoms fused together. Prout&#x27;s hypothesis was dismissed by chemists when by the 1830s it was found that some elements seemed to have a non-integer atomic weight—e.g. chlorine has an atomic weight of about 35.45. But the idea continued to intrigue scientists. The discrepancies were eventually explained with the discovery of isotopes in 1912.

A few months after Thomson&#x27;s paper appeared, George FitzGerald suggested that the corpuscle identified by Thomson from cathode rays and proposed as parts of an atom was a &quot;free electron&quot;, as described by physicist Joseph Larmor and Hendrik Lorentz. While Thomson did not adopt the terminology, the connection convinced other scientists that cathode rays were particles, an important step in their eventual acceptance of an atomic model based on sub-atomic particles.

In 1899 Thomson reiterated his atomic model in a paper that showed that negative electricity created by ultraviolet light landing on a metal (known now as the photoelectric effect) has the same mass-to-charge ratio as cathode rays; then he applied his previous method for determining the charge on ions to the negative electric particles created by ultraviolet light. He estimated that the electron&#x27;s mass was 0.0014 times that of the hydrogen ion (as a fraction: ). In the conclusion of this paper he writes:
===1904 Mechanical model of the atom ===
Thomson provided his first detailed description of the atom in his 1904 paper &quot;On the Structure of the Atom&quot;.
Thomson starts with a short description of his model
... the atoms of the elements consist of a number of negatively electrified corpuscles enclosed in a sphere of uniform positive electrification, ...
Primarily focused on the electrons, Thomson adopted the positive sphere from Kelvin&#x27;s atom model proposed a year earlier. 
He then gives a detailed mechanical analysis of such a system, distributing the electrons uniformly around a ring. The attraction of the positive electrification is balanced by the mutual repulsion of the electrons. His analysis focuses on stability, looking for cases where small changes in position are countered by restoring forces.

After discussing his many formulae for stability he turned to analysing patterns in the number of electrons in various concentric rings of stable configurations. These regular patterns Thomson argued are analogous to the periodic law of chemistry behind the structure of the periodic table. This concept, that a model based on subatomic particles could account for chemical trends, encouraged interest in Thomson&#x27;s model and influenced future work even if the details Thomson&#x27;s electron assignments turned out to be incorrect.

Thomson at this point believed that all the mass of the atom was carried by the electrons. This would mean that even a small atom would have to contain thousands of electrons, and the positive electrification that encapsulated them was without mass.

===1905 lecture on electron arrangements===
In a lecture delivered to the Royal Institution of Great Britain in 1905, Thomson explained that it was too computationally difficult for him to calculate the movements of large numbers of electrons in the positive sphere, so he proposed a practical experiment. This involved magnetised pins pushed into cork discs and set afloat in a basin of water. The pins were oriented such that they repelled each other. Above the centre of the basin was suspended an electromagnet that attracted the pins. The equilibrium arrangement the pins took informed Thomson on what arrangements the electrons in an atom might take.

For instance, he observed that while five pins would arrange themselves in a stable pentagon around the centre, six pins could not form a stable hexagon. Instead, one pin would move to the centre and the other five would form a pentagon around the centre pin, and this arrangement was stable. As he added more pins, they would arrange themselves in concentric rings around the centre.

The experiment functioned in two dimensions instead of three, but Thomson inferred the electrons in the atom arranged themselves in concentric shells and the could move within these shells but did not move from one shell to another them except when electrons were added or subtracted from the atom.
===1906 Estimating electrons per atom===
Before 1906 Thomson considered the atomic weight to be due to the mass of the electrons (which he continued to call &quot;corpuscles&quot;). Based on his own estimates of the electron mass, an atom would need tens of thousands electrons to account for the mass. In 1906 he used three different methods, X-ray scattering, beta ray absorption, or optical properties of gases, to estimate that &quot;number of corpuscles is not greatly different from the atomic weight&quot;. This reduced the number of electrons to tens or at most a couple of hundred and that in turn meant that the positive sphere in Thomson&#x27;s model contained most of the mass of the atom. This meant that Thomson&#x27;s mechanical stability work from 1904 and the comparison to the periodic table were no longer valid. Moreover, the alpha particle, so important to the next advance in atomic theory by Rutherford, would no longer be viewed as an atom containing thousands of electrons.

In 1907, Thomson published &quot;The Corpuscular Theory of Matter&quot; which reviewed his ideas on the atom&#x27;s structure and proposed further avenues of research.

In Chapter 6, he further elaborates his experiment using magnetised pins in water, providing an expanded table. For instance, if 59 pins were placed in the pool, they would arrange themselves in concentric rings of the order 20-16-13-8-2 (from outermost to innermost).

In Chapter 7, Thomson summarised his 1906 results on the number of electrons in an atom. He included one important correction: he replaced the beta-particle analysis with one based on the cathode ray experiments of August Becker, giving a result in better agreement with other approaches to the problem. Experiments by other scientists in this field had shown that atoms contain far fewer electrons than Thomson previously thought. Thomson now believed the number of electrons in an atom was a small multiple of its atomic weight: &quot;the number of corpuscles in an atom of any element is proportional to the atomic weight of the element — it is a multiple, and not a large one, of the atomic weight of the element.&quot; This meant that almost all of the atom&#x27;s mass had to be carried by the positive sphere, whatever it was made of.

Thomson in this book estimated that a hydrogen atom is 1,700 times heavier than an electron (the current measurement is 1,837). Thomson noted that no scientist had yet found a positively charged particle smaller than a hydrogen ion. He also wrote that the positive charge of an atom is a multiple of a basic unit of positive charge, equal to the negative charge of an electron. Thomson refused to jump to the conclusion that the basic unit of positive charge has a mass equal to that of the hydrogen ion, arguing that scientists first had to know how many electrons an atom contains. For all he could tell, a hydrogen ion might still contain a few electrons—perhaps two electrons and three units of positive charge.

=== 1910 Multiple scattering ===
Thomson&#x27;s difficulty with beta scattering in 1906 lead him to renewed interest in the topic. He encouraged J. Arnold Crowther to experiment with beta scattering through thin foils and, in 1910, Thomson produced a new theory of beta scattering. The two innovations in this paper was the introduction of scattering from the positive sphere of the atom and analysis that multiple or compound scattering was critical to the final results. This theory and Crowther&#x27;s experimental results would be confronted by Rutherford&#x27;s theory and Geiger and Mardsen new experiments with alpha particles.

Another innovation in Thomson&#x27;s 1910 paper was that he modelled how an atom might deflect an incoming beta particle if the positive charge of the atom existed in discrete units of equal but arbitrary size, spread evenly throughout the atom, separated by empty space, with each unit having a positive charge equal to the electron&#x27;s negative charge. Thomson therefore came close to deducing the existence of the proton, which was something Rutherford eventually did. In Rutherford&#x27;s model of the atom, the protons are clustered in a very small nucleus, but in Thomson&#x27;s alternative model, the positive units were spread throughout the atom.

== Thomson&#x27;s 1910 scattering model==
In his 1910 paper &quot;On the Scattering of rapidly moving Electrified Particles&quot;, Thomson presented equations that modelled how beta particles scatter in a collision with an atom. His work was based on beta scattering studies by James Crowther.

===Deflection by the positive sphere===
Thomson typically assumed the positive charge in the atom was uniformly distributed throughout its volume, encapsulating the electrons. In his 1910 paper, Thomson presented the following equation which isolated the effect of this positive sphere:

formula_1

where &quot;k&quot; is the Coulomb constant, &quot;q&quot;e is the charge of the beta particle, &quot;q&quot;g is the charge of the positive sphere, &quot;m&quot; is the mass of the beta particle, and &quot;R&quot; is the radius of the sphere. Because the atom is many thousands of times heavier than the beta particle, no correction for recoil is needed.

Thomson did not explain how this equation was developed, but the historian John L. Heilbron provided an educated guess he called a &quot;straight-line&quot; approximation. Consider a beta particle passing through the positive sphere with its initial trajectory at a lateral distance &quot;b&quot; from the centre. The path is assumed to have a very small deflection and therefore is treated here as a straight line.

Inside a sphere of uniformly distributed positive charge the force exerted on the beta particle at any point along its path through the sphere would be directed along the radius with magnitude:

formula_2

The component of force perpendicular to the trajectory and thus deflecting the path of the particle would be:

formula_3

The lateral change in momentum &quot;p&quot;y is therefore

formula_4

The resulting angular deflection, formula_5, is given by

formula_6

where &quot;p&quot;x is the average horizontal momentum taken to be equal to the incoming momentum. Since we already know the deflection is very small, we can treat formula_7 as being equal to formula_5.

To find the average deflection angle formula_9, the angle for each value of &quot;b&quot; and the corresponding &quot;L&quot; are added across the face sphere, then divided by the cross-section area. formula_10 per Pythagorean theorem.

formula_11

formula_12

This matches Thomson&#x27;s formula in his 1910 paper.

===Deflection by the electrons===
Thomson modelled the collisions between a beta particle and the electrons of an atom by calculating the deflection of one collision then multiplying by a factor for the number of collisions as the particle crosses the atom.

For the electrons within an arbitrary distance &quot;s&quot; of the beta particle&#x27;s path, their mean distance will be . Therefore, the average deflection per electron will be

formula_13

where &quot;q&quot;e is the elementary charge, &quot;k&quot; is the Coulomb constant, &quot;m&quot; and &quot;v&quot; are the mass and velocity of the beta particle.

The factor for the number of collisions was known to be the square root of the number of possible electrons along path. The number of electrons depends upon the density of electrons along the particle path times the path length &quot;L&quot;.
The net deflection caused by all the electrons within this arbitrary cylinder of effect around the beta particle&#x27;s path is

formula_14

where &quot;N&quot;0 is the number of electrons per unit volume and formula_15 is the volume of this cylinder.

Since Thomson calculated the deflection would be very small, he treats &quot;L&quot; as a straight line. Therefore formula_16 where &quot;b&quot; is the distance of this chord from the centre. The mean of formula_17 is given by the integral

formula_18

We can now replace formula_17 in the equation for formula_20 to obtain the mean deflection formula_21:

formula_22

formula_23

where &quot;N&quot; is the number of electrons in the atom, equal to formula_24.

===Deflection by the positive charge in discrete units===
In his 1910 paper, Thomson proposed an alternative model in which the positive charge exists in discrete units separated by empty space, with those units being evenly distributed throughout the atom&#x27;s volume.

In this concept, the average scattering angle of the beta particle is given by:

formula_25

where &quot;σ&quot; is the ratio of the volume occupied by the positive charge to the volume of the whole atom. Thomson did not explain how he arrived at this equation.

===Net deflection===
To find the combined effect of the positive charge and the electrons on the beta particle&#x27;s path, Thomson provided the following equation:

formula_26

==Demise of the plum pudding model==
Thomson probed the structure of atoms through beta particle scattering, whereas his former student Ernest Rutherford was interested in alpha particle scattering. Beta particles are electrons emitted by radioactive decay, whereas alpha particles are essentially helium atoms, also emitted in process of decay. Alpha particles have considerably more momentum than beta particles and Rutherford found that matter scatters alpha particles in ways that Thomson&#x27;s plum pudding model could not predict.

Between 1908 and 1913, Ernest Rutherford, Hans Geiger, and Ernest Marsden collaborated on a series of experiments in which they bombarded thin metal foils with a beam of alpha particles and measured the intensity versus scattering angle of the particles. They found that the metal foil could scatter alpha particles by more than 90°. This should not have been possible according to the Thomson model: the scattering into large angles should have been negligible. The odds of a beta particle being scattered by more than 90° under such circumstances is astronomically small, and since alpha particles typically have much more momentum than beta particles, their deflection should be smaller still. The Thomson models simply could not produce electrostatic forces of sufficient strength to cause such large deflection. The charges in the Thomson model were too diffuse. This led Rutherford to discard the Thomson for a new model where the positive charge of the atom is concentrated in a tiny nucleus.

Rutherford went on to make more compelling discoveries. In Thomson&#x27;s model, the positive charge sphere was just an abstract component, but Rutherford found something concrete to attribute the positive charge to: particles he dubbed &quot;protons&quot;. Whereas Thomson believed that the electron count was roughly correlated to the atomic weight, Rutherford showed that (in a neutral atom) it is exactly equal to the atomic number.

Thomson hypothesised that the arrangement of the electrons in the atom somehow determined the spectral lines of a chemical element. He was on the right track, but it had nothing to do with how atoms circulated in a sphere of positive charge. Scientists eventually discovered that it had to do with how electrons absorb and release energy in discrete quantities, moving through energy levels which correspond to emission and absorption spectra. Thomson had not incorporated quantum mechanics into his atomic model, which at the time was a very new field of physics. Niels Bohr and Erwin Schroedinger later incorporated quantum mechanics into the atomic model.

=== Rutherford&#x27;s nuclear model ===

Rutherford&#x27;s 1911 paper on alpha particle scattering showed that Thomson&#x27;s scattering model could not explain the large angle scattering and it showed that multiple scattering was not necessary to explain the data. However, in the years immediately following its publication few scientists took note. The scattering model predictions were not considered definitive evidence against Thomson&#x27;s plum pudding model. Thomson and Rutherford had pioneered scattering as a technique to probe atoms, its reliability and value were unproven. Before Rutherford&#x27;s paper the alpha particle was considered an atom, not a compact mass. It was not clear why it should be a good probe. Moreover, Rutherford&#x27;s paper did not discuss the atomic electrons vital to practical problems like chemistry or atomic spectroscopy. Rutherford&#x27;s nuclear model would only become widely accepted after the work of Niels Bohr.

==Mathematical Thomson problem==
The Thomson problem in mathematics seeks the optimal distribution of equal point charges on the surface of a sphere. Unlike the original Thomson atomic model, the sphere in this purely mathematical model does not have a charge, and this causes all the point charges to move to the surface of the sphere by their mutual repulsion. There is still no general solution to Thomson&#x27;s original problem of how electrons arrange themselves within a sphere of positive charge.

==Origin of the nickname==

The first known writer to compare Thomson&#x27;s model to a plum pudding was an anonymous reporter in an article for the British pharmaceutical magazine &quot;The Chemist and Druggist&quot; in August 1906.

The analogy was never used by Thomson nor his colleagues. It seems to have been coined by popular science writers to make the model easier to understand for the layman.

<text>Atomic theory is the scientific theory that matter is composed of particles called atoms. The definition of the word &quot;atom&quot; has changed over the years in response to scientific discoveries. Initially, it referred to a hypothetical concept of there being some fundamental particle of matter, too small to be seen by the naked eye, that could not be divided. Then the definition was refined to being the basic particles of the chemical elements, when chemists observed that elements seemed to combine with each other in ratios of small whole numbers. Then physicists discovered that these particles had an internal structure of their own and therefore perhaps did not deserve to be called &quot;atoms&quot;, but renaming atoms would have been impractical by that point.

Atomic theory is one of the most important scientific developments in history, crucial to all the physical sciences. At the start of &quot;The Feynman Lectures on Physics&quot;, physicist and Nobel laureate Richard Feynman offers the atomic hypothesis as the single most prolific scientific concept.

==Philosophical atomism==
The basic idea that matter is made up of tiny indivisible particles is an old idea that appeared in many ancient cultures. The word &quot;atom&quot; is derived from the ancient Greek word &quot;atomos&quot;, which means &quot;uncuttable&quot;. This ancient idea was based in philosophical reasoning rather than scientific reasoning. Modern atomic theory is not based on these old concepts. In the early 19th century, the scientist John Dalton noticed that chemical substances seemed to combine with each other by discrete and consistent units of weight, and he decided to use the word &quot;atom&quot; to refer to these units.

==Groundwork==
Working in the late 17th century, Robert Boyle developed the concept of a chemical element as substance different from a compound.
Near the end of the 18th century, a number of important developments in chemistry emerged without referring to the notion of an atomic theory. The first was Antoine Lavoisier who showed that compounds consist of elements in constant proportion, redefining an element as a substance which scientists could not decompose into simpler substances by experimentation. This brought an end to the ancient idea of the elements of matter being fire, earth, air, and water, which had no experimental support. Lavoisier showed that water can be decomposed into hydrogen and oxygen, which in turn he could not decompose into anything simpler, thereby proving these are elements. Lavoisier also defined the law of conservation of mass, which states that in a chemical reaction, matter does not appear nor disappear into thin air; the total mass remains the same even if the substances involved were transformed. Finally, there was the law of definite proportions, established by the French chemist Joseph Proust in 1797, which states that if a compound is broken down into its constituent chemical elements, then the masses of those constituents will always have the same proportions by weight, regardless of the quantity or source of the original compound. This definition distinguished compounds from mixtures.

==Dalton&#x27;s law of multiple proportions==
John Dalton studied data gathered by himself and by other scientists. He noticed a pattern that later came to be known as the law of multiple proportions: in compounds which contain two particular elements, the amount of Element A per measure of Element B will differ across these compounds by ratios of small whole numbers. This suggested that each element combines with other elements in multiples of a basic quantity.

In 1804, Dalton explained his atomic theory to his friend and fellow chemist Thomas Thomson, who published an explanation of Dalton&#x27;s theory in his book &quot;A System of Chemistry&quot; in 1807. According to Thomson, Dalton&#x27;s idea first occurred to him when experimenting with &quot;olefiant gas&quot; (ethylene) and &quot;carburetted hydrogen gas&quot; (methane). Dalton found that &quot;carburetted hydrogen gas&quot; contains twice as much hydrogen per measure of carbon as &quot;olefiant gas&quot;, and concluded that a molecule of &quot;olefiant gas&quot; is one carbon atom and one hydrogen atom, and a molecule of &quot;carburetted hydrogen gas&quot; is one carbon atom and two hydrogen atoms. In reality, an ethylene molecule has two carbon atoms and four hydrogen atoms (C2H4), and a methane molecule has one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms (CH4). In this particular case, Dalton was mistaken about the formulas of these compounds, and it wasn&#x27;t his only mistake. But in other cases, he got their formulas right, as in the following examples:

Example 1 — tin oxides: Dalton identified two types of tin oxide. One is a grey powder that Dalton referred to as &quot;the protoxide of tin&quot;, which is 88.1% tin and 11.9% oxygen. The other is a white powder which Dalton referred to as &quot;the deutoxide of tin&quot;, which is 78.7% tin and 21.3% oxygen. Adjusting these figures, in the grey powder there is about 13.5 g of oxygen for every 100 g of tin, and in the white powder there is about 27 g of oxygen for every 100 g of tin. 13.5 and 27 form a ratio of 1:2. These compounds are known today as tin(II) oxide (SnO) and tin(IV) oxide (SnO2). In Dalton&#x27;s terminology, a &quot;protoxide&quot; is a molecule containing a single oxygen atom, and a &quot;deutoxide&quot; molecule has two. The modern equivalents of his terms would be &quot;monoxide&quot; and &quot;dioxide&quot;.

Example 2 — iron oxides: Dalton identified two oxides of iron. There is one type of iron oxide that is a black powder which Dalton referred to as &quot;the protoxide of iron&quot;, which is 78.1% iron and 21.9% oxygen. The other iron oxide is a red powder, which Dalton referred to as &quot;the intermediate or red oxide of iron&quot; which is 70.4% iron and 29.6% oxygen. Adjusting these figures, in the black powder there is about 28 g of oxygen for every 100 g of iron, and in the red powder there is about 42 g of oxygen for every 100 g of iron. 28 and 42 form a ratio of 2:3. These compounds are iron(II) oxide and iron(III) oxide and their formulas are Fe2O2 and Fe2O3 respectively (iron(II) oxide&#x27;s formula is normally written as FeO, but here it is written as Fe2O2 to contrast it with the other oxide). Dalton described the &quot;intermediate oxide&quot; as being &quot;2 atoms protoxide and 1 of oxygen&quot;, which adds up to two atoms of iron and three of oxygen. That averages to one and a half atoms of oxygen for every iron atom, putting it midway between a &quot;protoxide&quot; and a &quot;deutoxide&quot;.

Example 3 — nitrogen oxides: Dalton was aware of three oxides of nitrogen: &quot;nitrous oxide&quot;, &quot;nitrous gas&quot;, and &quot;nitric acid&quot;. These compounds are known today as nitrous oxide, nitric oxide, and nitrogen dioxide respectively. &quot;Nitrous oxide&quot; is 63.3% nitrogen and 36.7% oxygen, which means it has 80 g of oxygen for every 140 g of nitrogen. &quot;Nitrous gas&quot; is 44.05% nitrogen and 55.95% oxygen, which means there is 160 g of oxygen for every 140 g of nitrogen. &quot;Nitric acid&quot; is 29.5% nitrogen and 70.5% oxygen, which means it has 320 g of oxygen for every 140 g of nitrogen. 80 g, 160 g, and 320 g form a ratio of 1:2:4. The formulas for these compounds are N2O, NO, and NO2.

Dalton defined an atom as being the &quot;ultimate particle&quot; of a chemical substance, and he used the term &quot;compound atom&quot; to refer to &quot;ultimate particles&quot; which contain two or more elements. This is inconsistent with the modern definition, wherein an atom is the basic particle of a chemical element and a molecule is an agglomeration of atoms. The term &quot;compound atom&quot; was confusing to some of Dalton&#x27;s contemporaries as the word &quot;atom&quot; implies indivisibility, but he responded that if a carbon dioxide &quot;atom&quot; is divided, it ceases to be carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide &quot;atom&quot; is indivisible in the sense that it cannot be divided into smaller carbon dioxide particles.

Dalton made the following assumptions on how &quot;elementary atoms&quot; combined to form &quot;compound atoms&quot; (what we today refer to as molecules). When two elements can only form one compound, he assumed it was one atom of each, which he called a &quot;binary compound&quot;. If two elements can form two compounds, the first compound is a binary compound and the second is a &quot;ternary compound&quot; consisting of one atom of the first element and two of the second. If two elements can form three compounds between them, then the third compound is a &quot;quaternary&quot; compound containing one atom of the first element and three of the second. Dalton thought that water was a &quot;binary compound&quot;, i.e. one hydrogen atom and one oxygen atom. Dalton did not know that in their natural gaseous state, the ultimate particles of oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen exist in pairs (O2, N2, and H2). Nor was he aware of valencies. These properties of atoms were discovered later in the 19th century.

Because atoms were too small to be directly weighed using the methods of the 19th century, Dalton instead expressed the weights of the myriad atoms as multiples of the hydrogen atom&#x27;s weight, which Dalton knew was the lightest element. By his measurements, 7 grams of oxygen will combine with 1 gram of hydrogen to make 8 grams of water with nothing left over, and assuming a water molecule to be one oxygen atom and one hydrogen atom, he concluded that oxygen&#x27;s atomic weight is 7. In reality it is 16. Aside from the crudity of early 19th century measurement tools, the main reason for this error was that Dalton didn&#x27;t know that the water molecule in fact has two hydrogen atoms, not one. Had he known, he would have doubled his estimate to a more accurate 14. This error was corrected in 1811 by Amedeo Avogadro. Avogadro proposed that equal volumes of any two gases, at equal temperature and pressure, contain equal numbers of molecules (in other words, the mass of a gas&#x27;s particles does not affect the volume that it occupies). Avogadro&#x27;s hypothesis, now usually called Avogadro&#x27;s law, provided a method for deducing the relative weights of the molecules of gaseous elements, for if the hypothesis is correct relative gas densities directly indicate the relative weights of the particles that compose the gases. This way of thinking led directly to a second hypothesis: the particles of certain elemental gases were pairs of atoms, and when reacting chemically these molecules often split in two. For instance, the fact that two liters of hydrogen will react with just one liter of oxygen to produce two liters of water vapor (at constant pressure and temperature) suggested that a single oxygen molecule splits in two in order to form two molecules of water. The formula of water is H2O, not HO. Avogadro measured oxygen&#x27;s atomic weight to be 15.074.

==Opposition to atomic theory==
Dalton&#x27;s atomic theory attracted widespread interest but not everyone accepted it at first. The law of multiple proportions was shown not to be a universal law when it came to organic substances, whose molecules can be quite large. For instance, in oleic acid there is 34 g of hydrogen for every 216 g of carbon, and in methane there is 72 g of hydrogen for every 216 g of carbon. 34 and 72 form a ratio of 17:36, which is not a ratio of small whole numbers. We know now that carbon-based substances can have very large molecules, larger than any the other elements can form. Oleic acid&#x27;s formula is C18H34O2 and methane&#x27;s is CH4. The law of multiple proportions by itself was not complete proof, and atomic theory was not universally accepted until the end of the 19th century.

One problem was the lack of uniform nomenclature. The word &quot;atom&quot; implied indivisibility, but Dalton defined an atom as being the ultimate particle of any chemical substance, not just the elements or even matter per se. This meant that &quot;compound atoms&quot; such as carbon dioxide could be divided, as opposed to &quot;elementary atoms&quot;. Dalton disliked the word &quot;molecule&quot;, regarding it as &quot;diminutive&quot;. Amedeo Avogadro did the opposite: he exclusively used the word &quot;molecule&quot; in his writings, eschewing the word &quot;atom&quot;, instead using the term &quot;elementary molecule&quot;. Jöns Jacob Berzelius used the term &quot;organic atoms&quot; to refer to particles containing three or more elements, because he thought this only existed in organic compounds. Jean-Baptiste Dumas used the terms &quot;physical atoms&quot; and &quot;chemical atoms&quot;; a &quot;physical atom&quot; was a particle that cannot be divided by physical means such as temperature and pressure, and a &quot;chemical atom&quot; was a particle that could not be divided by chemical reactions.

The modern definitions of &quot;atom&quot; and &quot;molecule&quot;—an atom being the basic particle of an element, and a molecule being an agglomeration of atoms—were established in the late half of the 19th century. A key event was the Karlsruhe Congress in Germany in 1860. As the first international congress of chemists, its goal was to establish some standards in the community. A major proponent of the modern distinction between atoms and molecules was Stanislao Cannizzaro.

Cannizzaro criticized past chemists such as Berzelius for not accepting that the particles of certain gaseous elements are actually pairs of atoms, which led to mistakes in their formulation of certain compounds. Berzelius believed that hydrogen gas and chlorine gas particles are solitary atoms. But he observed that when one liter of hydrogen reacts with one liter of chlorine, they form two liters of hydrogen chloride instead of one. Berzelius decided that Avogadro&#x27;s law does not apply to compounds. Cannizzaro preached that if scientists just accepted the existence of single-element molecules, such discrepancies in their findings would be easily resolved. But Berzelius did not even have a word for that. Berzelius used the term &quot;elementary atom&quot; for a gas particle which contained just one element and &quot;compound atom&quot; for particles which contained two or more elements, but there was nothing to distinguish H2 from H since Berzelius did not believe in H2. So Cannizzaro called for a redefinition so that scientists could understand that a hydrogen &quot;molecule&quot; can split into two hydrogen &quot;atoms&quot; in the course of a chemical reaction.

A second objection to atomic theory was philosophical. Scientists in the 19th century had no way of directly observing atoms. They inferred the existence of atoms through indirect observations, such as Dalton&#x27;s law of multiple proportions. Some scientists adopted positions aligned with the philosophy of positivism, arguing that scientists should not attempt to deduce the deeper reality of the universe, but only systemize what patterns they could directly observe.

This generation of anti-atomists can be grouped in two camps. 
The &quot;equivalentists&quot;, like Marcellin Berthelot, believed the theory of equivalent weights was adequate for scientific purposes. This generalization of Proust&#x27;s law of definite proportions summarized observations. For example, 1 gram of hydrogen will combine with 8 grams of oxygen to form 9 grams of water, therefore the &quot;equivalent weight&quot; of oxygen is 8 grams. The &quot;energeticist&quot;, like Ernst Mach and Wilhelm Ostwald, were philosophically opposed to hypothesis about reality altogether. In their view, only energy as part of thermodynamics should be the basis of physical models.

These positions were eventually quashed by two important advancements that happened later in the 19th century: the development of the periodic table and the discovery that molecules have an internal architecture that determines their properties.

==Isomerism==
Scientists discovered some substances have the exact same chemical content but different properties. For instance, in 1827, Friedrich Wöhler discovered that silver fulminate and silver cyanate are both 107 parts silver, 12 parts carbon, 14 parts nitrogen, and 16 parts oxygen (we now know their formulas as both AgCNO). In 1830 Jöns Jacob Berzelius introduced the term &quot;isomerism&quot; to describe the phenomenon. In 1860, Louis Pasteur hypothesized that the molecules of isomers might have the same set of atoms but in different arrangements.

In 1874, Jacobus Henricus van &#x27;t Hoff proposed that the carbon atom bonds to other atoms in a tetrahedral arrangement. Working from this, he explained the structures of organic molecules in such a way that he could predict how many isomers a compound could have. Consider, for example, pentane (C5H12). In van &#x27;t Hoff&#x27;s way of modelling molecules, there are three possible configurations for pentane, and scientists did go on to discover three and only three isomers of pentane.

Isomerism was not something that could be fully explained by alternative theories to atomic theory, such as radical theory and the theory of types.

==Mendeleev&#x27;s periodic table==

Dmitrii Mendeleev noticed that when he arranged the elements in a row according to their atomic weights, there was a certain periodicity to them. For instance, the second element, lithium, had similar properties to the ninth element, sodium, and the sixteenth element, potassium — a period of seven. Likewise, beryllium, magnesium, and calcium were similar and all were seven places apart from each other on Mendeleev&#x27;s table. Using these patterns, Mendeleev predicted the existence and properties of new elements, which were later discovered in nature: scandium, gallium, and germanium. Moreover, the periodic table could predict how many atoms of other elements that an atom could bond with — e.g., germanium and carbon are in the same group on the table and their atoms both combine with two oxygen atoms each (GeO2 and CO2). Mendeleev found these patterns validated atomic theory because it showed that the elements could be categorized by their atomic weight. Inserting a new element into the middle of a period would break the parallel between that period and the next, and would also violate Dalton&#x27;s law of multiple proportions.
The elements on the periodic table were originally arranged in order of increasing atomic weight. However, in a number of places chemists chose to swap the positions of certain adjacent elements so that they appeared in a group with other elements with similar properties. For instance, tellurium is placed before iodine even though tellurium is heavier (127.6 vs 126.9) so that iodine can be in the same column as the other halogens. The modern periodic table is based on atomic number, which is equivalent to the nuclear charge, a change had to wait for the discovery of the nucleus. 
In addition, an entire row of the table was not shown
because the noble gases had not been discovered when Mendeleev devised his table.

==Statistical mechanics==
In 1738, Swiss physicist and mathematician Daniel Bernoulli postulated that the pressure of gases and heat were both caused by the underlying motion of particles. Using his model he could predict the ideal gas law at constant temperature and suggested that the temperature was proportional to the velocity of the particles. These results were largely ignored for a century.

James Clerk Maxwell, a vocal proponent of atomism, revived the kinetic theory in 1860 and 1867. His key insight was that the velocity of particles in a gas would vary around an average value, introducing the concept of a distribution function. Ludwig Boltzmann and Rudolf Clausius expanded his work on gases and the laws of thermodynamics especially the second law relating to entropy. In the 1870s, Josiah Willard Gibbs extended the laws of entropy and thermodynamics and coined the term &quot;statistical mechanics.&quot;

Boltzmann defended the atomistic hypothesis against major detractors from the time like Ernst Mach or energeticists like Wilhelm Ostwald, who considered that energy was the elementary quantity of reality.

At the beginning of the 20th century, Albert Einstein independently reinvented Gibbs&#x27; laws, because they had only been printed in an obscure American journal. Einstein later commented that had he known of Gibbs&#x27; work, he would &quot;not have published those papers at all, but confined myself to the treatment of some few points [that were distinct].&quot; All of statistical mechanics and the laws of heat, gas, and entropy took the existence of atoms as a necessary postulate.

===Brownian motion===
In 1827, the British botanist Robert Brown observed that dust particles inside pollen grains floating in water constantly jiggled about for no apparent reason. In 1905, Einstein theorized that this Brownian motion was caused by the water molecules continuously knocking the grains about, and developed a mathematical model to describe it. This model was validated experimentally in 1908 by French physicist Jean Perrin, who used Einstein&#x27;s equations to measure the size of atoms.

==Discovery of the electron==

Atoms were thought to be the smallest possible division of matter until 1899 when J. J. Thomson discovered the electron through his work on cathode rays.

A Crookes tube is a sealed glass container in which two electrodes are separated by a vacuum. When a voltage is applied across the electrodes, cathode rays are generated, creating a glowing patch where they strike the glass at the opposite end of the tube. Through experimentation, Thomson discovered that the rays could be deflected by electric fields and magnetic fields, which meant that these rays were not a form of light but were composed of very light charged particles, and their charge was negative. Thomson called these particles &quot;corpuscles&quot;. He measured their mass-to-charge ratio to be several orders of magnitude smaller than that of the hydrogen atom, the smallest atom. This ratio was the same regardless of what the electrodes were made of and what the trace gas in the tube was.

In contrast to those corpuscles, positive ions created by electrolysis or X-ray radiation had mass-to-charge ratios that varied depending on the material of the electrodes and the type of gas in the reaction chamber, indicating they were different kinds of particles.

In 1898, Thomson measured the charge on ions to be roughly 6 × 10−10 electrostatic units (2 × 10−19 Coulombs). In 1899, he showed that negative electricity created by ultraviolet light landing on a metal (known now as the photoelectric effect) has the same mass-to-charge ratio as cathode rays; then he applied his previous method for determining the charge on ions to the negative electric particles created by ultraviolet light. By this combination he showed that electron&#x27;s mass was 0.0014 times that of hydrogen ions. These &quot;corpuscles&quot; were so light yet carried so much charge that Thomson concluded they must be the basic particles of electricity, and for that reason other scientists decided that these &quot;corpuscles&quot; should instead be called electrons following an 1894 suggestion by George Johnstone Stoney for naming the basic unit of electrical charge.

In 1904, Thomson published a paper describing a new model of the atom. Electrons reside within atoms, and they transplant themselves from one atom to the next in a chain in the action of an electrical current. When electrons do not flow, their negative charge logically must be balanced out by some source of positive charge within the atom so as to render the atom electrically neutral. Having no clue as to the source of this positive charge, Thomson tentatively proposed that the positive charge was everywhere in the atom, the atom being shaped like a sphere—this was the mathematically simplest model to fit the available evidence (or lack of it). The balance of electrostatic forces would distribute the electrons throughout this sphere in a more or less even manner. Thomson further explained that ions are atoms that have a surplus or shortage of electrons.

Thomson&#x27;s model is popularly known as the plum pudding model, based on the idea that the electrons are distributed throughout the sphere of positive charge with the same density as raisins in a plum pudding. Neither Thomson nor his colleagues ever used this analogy. It seems to have been a conceit of popular science writers. The analogy suggests that the positive sphere is like a solid, but Thomson likened it to a liquid, as he proposed that the electrons moved around in it in patterns governed by the electrostatic forces. More to the point, the positive electrification in Thomson&#x27;s model was an abstraction, he did not propose anything concrete like a particle. Thomson&#x27;s model was incomplete, it could not predict any of the known properties of the atom such as emission spectra or valencies.

In 1906, Robert A. Millikan and Harvey Fletcher performed the oil drop experiment in which they measured the charge of an electron to be about -1.6 × 10−19, a value now defined as -1 &quot;e&quot;. Since the hydrogen ion and the electron were known to be indivisible and a hydrogen atom is neutral in charge, it followed that the positive charge in hydrogen was equal to this value, i.e. 1 &quot;e&quot;.

==Discovery of the nucleus==
Thomson&#x27;s plum pudding model was challenged in 1911 by one of his former students, Ernest Rutherford, who presented a new model to explain new experimental data. The new model proposed a concentrated center of charge and mass that was later dubbed the atomic nucleus.

Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden came to have doubts about the Thomson model after they encountered difficulties when they tried to build an instrument to measure the charge-to-mass ratio of alpha particles (these are positively-charged particles emitted by certain radioactive substances such as radium). The alpha particles were being scattered by the air in the detection chamber, which made the measurements unreliable. Thomson had encountered a similar problem in his work on cathode rays, which he solved by creating a near-perfect vacuum in his instruments. Rutherford didn&#x27;t think he&#x27;d run into this same problem because alpha particles usually have much more momentum than electrons. According to Thomson&#x27;s model of the atom, the positive charge in the atom is not concentrated enough to produce an electric field strong enough to deflect an alpha particle. Yet there was scattering, so Rutherford and his colleagues decided to investigate this scattering carefully.

Between 1908 and 1913, Rutherford and his colleagues performed a series of experiments in which they bombarded thin foils of metal with a beam of alpha particles. They spotted alpha particles being deflected by angles greater than 90°. According to Thomson&#x27;s model, all of the alpha particles should have passed through with negligible deflection. Rutherford deduced that the positive charge of the atom is not distributed throughout the atom&#x27;s volume as Thomson believed, but is concentrated in a tiny nucleus at the center. This nucleus also carries most of the atom&#x27;s mass. Only such an intense concentration of charge, anchored by its high mass, could produce an electric field strong enough to deflect the alpha particles as observed. Rutherford&#x27;s model, being supported primarily by scattering data unfamiliar to many scientists, did not catch on until Niels Bohr joined Rutherford&#x27;s lab and developed a new model for the electrons.

Rutherford model predicted that the scattering of alpha particles would be proportional to the square of the atomic charge. Geiger and Marsden&#x27;s based their analysis on setting the charge to half of the atomic weight of the foil&#x27;s material (gold, aluminium, etc.). Amateur physicist Antonius van den Broek noted that there was a more precise relation between the charge and the element&#x27;s numeric sequence in the order of atomic weights. The sequence number came be called the atomic number and it replaced atomic weight in organizing the periodic table.
==Bohr model==

Rutherford deduced the existence of the atomic nucleus through his experiments but he had nothing to say about how the electrons were arranged around it. In 1912, Niels Bohr joined Rutherford&#x27;s lab and began his work on a quantum model of the atom.

Max Planck in 1900 and Albert Einstein in 1905 had postulated that light energy is emitted or absorbed in discrete amounts known as quanta (singular, &quot;quantum&quot;). This led to a series of atomic models with some quantum aspects, such as that of Arthur Erich Haas in 1910 and the 1912 John William Nicholson atomic model with quantized angular momentum as &quot;h&quot;/2. The dynamical structure of these models was still classical, but in 1913, Bohr abandon the classical approach. He started his Bohr model of the atom with a quantum hypothesis: an electron could only orbit the nucleus in particular circular orbits with fixed angular momentum and energy, its distance from the nucleus (i.e., their radii) being proportional to its energy. Under this model an electron could not lose energy in a continuous manner; instead, it could only make instantaneous &quot;quantum leaps&quot; between the fixed energy levels. When this occurred, light was emitted or absorbed at a frequency proportional to the change in energy (hence the absorption and emission of light in discrete spectra).

In a trilogy of papers Bohr described and applied his model to derive the Balmer series of lines in the atomic spectrum of hydrogen and the related spectrum of He+. He also used he model to describe the structure of the periodic table and aspects of chemical bonding. Together these results lead to Bohr&#x27;s model being widely accepted by the end of 1915.

Bohr&#x27;s model was not perfect. It could only predict the spectral lines of hydrogen, not those of multielectron atoms. Worse still, it could not even account for all features of the hydrogen spectrum: as spectrographic technology improved, it was discovered that applying a magnetic field caused spectral lines to multiply in a way that Bohr&#x27;s model couldn&#x27;t explain. In 1916, Arnold Sommerfeld added elliptical orbits to the Bohr model to explain the extra emission lines, but this made the model very difficult to use, and it still couldn&#x27;t explain more complex atoms.

==Discovery of isotopes==

While experimenting with the products of radioactive decay, in 1913 radiochemist Frederick Soddy discovered that there appeared to be more than one variety of some elements. The term isotope was coined by Margaret Todd as a suitable name for these varieties.

That same year, J. J. Thomson conducted an experiment in which he channeled a stream of neon ions through magnetic and electric fields, striking a photographic plate at the other end. He observed two glowing patches on the plate, which suggested two different deflection trajectories. Thomson concluded this was because some of the neon ions had a different mass. The nature of this differing mass would later be explained by the discovery of neutrons in 1932: all atoms of the same element contain the same number of protons, while different isotopes have different numbers of neutrons.

==Discovery of the proton==

Back in 1815, William Prout observed that the atomic weights of the known elements were multiples of hydrogen&#x27;s atomic weight, so he hypothesized that all atoms are agglomerations of hydrogen, a particle which he dubbed &quot;the protyle&quot;. Prout&#x27;s hypothesis was put into doubt when some elements were found to deviate from this pattern—e.g. chlorine atoms on average weigh 35.45 daltons—but when isotopes were discovered in 1913, Prout&#x27;s observation gained renewed attention.

In 1898, J. J. Thomson found that the positive charge of a hydrogen ion was equal to the negative charge of a single electron.

In an April 1911 paper concerning his studies on alpha particle scattering, Ernest Rutherford estimated that the charge of an atomic nucleus, expressed as a multiplier of hydrogen&#x27;s nuclear charge (&quot;q&quot;e), is roughly half the atom&#x27;s atomic weight.

In June 1911, Van den Broek noted that on the periodic table, each successive chemical element increased in atomic weight on average by 2, which in turn suggested that each successive element&#x27;s nuclear charge increased by 1 &quot;q&quot;e. In 1913, van den Broek further proposed that the electric charge of an atom&#x27;s nucleus, expressed as a multiplier of the elementary charge, is equal to the element&#x27;s sequential position on the periodic table. Rutherford defined this position as being the element&#x27;s atomic number.

In 1913, Henry Moseley measured the X-ray emissions of all the elements on the periodic table and found that the frequency of the X-ray emissions was a mathematical function of the element&#x27;s atomic number and the charge of a hydrogen nucleus .

In 1917 Rutherford bombarded nitrogen gas with alpha particles and observed hydrogen ions being emitted from the gas. Rutherford concluded that the alpha particles struck the nuclei of the nitrogen atoms, causing hydrogen ions to split off.

These observations led Rutherford to conclude that the hydrogen nucleus was a singular particle with a positive charge equal to that of the electron&#x27;s negative charge. The name &quot;proton&quot; was suggested by Rutherford at an informal meeting of fellow physicists in Cardiff in 1920.

The charge number of an atomic nucleus was found to be equal to the element&#x27;s ordinal position on the periodic table. The nuclear charge number thus provided a simple and clear-cut way of distinguishing the chemical elements from each other, as opposed to Lavoisier&#x27;s classic definition of a chemical element being a substance that cannot be broken down into simpler substances by chemical reactions. The charge number or proton number was thereafter referred to as the atomic number of the element. In 1923, the International Committee on Chemical Elements officially declared the atomic number to be the distinguishing quality of a chemical element.

During the 1920s, some writers defined the atomic number as being the number of &quot;excess protons&quot; in a nucleus. Before the discovery of the neutron, scientists believed that the atomic nucleus contained a number of &quot;nuclear electrons&quot; which cancelled out the positive charge of some of its protons. This explained why the atomic weights of most atoms were higher than their atomic numbers. Helium, for instance, was thought to have four protons and two nuclear electrons in the nucleus, leaving two excess protons and a net nuclear charge of 2+. After the neutron was discovered, scientists realized the helium nucleus in fact contained two protons and two neutrons.

==Discovery of the neutron==
Physicists in the 1920s believed that the atomic nucleus contained protons plus a number of &quot;nuclear electrons&quot; that reduced the overall charge. These &quot;nuclear electrons&quot; were distinct from the electrons that orbited the nucleus. This incorrect hypothesis would have explained why the atomic numbers of the elements were less than their atomic weights, and why radioactive elements emit electrons (beta radiation) in the process of nuclear decay. Rutherford even hypothesized that a proton and an electron could bind tightly together into a &quot;neutral doublet&quot;. Rutherford wrote that the existence of such &quot;neutral doublets&quot; moving freely through space would provide a more plausible explanation for how the heavier elements could have formed in the genesis of the Universe, given that it is hard for a lone proton to fuse with a large atomic nucleus because of the repulsive electric field.

In 1928, Walter Bothe observed that beryllium emitted a highly penetrating, electrically neutral radiation when bombarded with alpha particles. It was later discovered that this radiation could knock hydrogen atoms out of paraffin wax. Initially it was thought to be high-energy gamma radiation, since gamma radiation had a similar effect on electrons in metals, but James Chadwick found that the ionization effect was too strong for it to be due to electromagnetic radiation, so long as energy and momentum were conserved in the interaction. In 1932, Chadwick exposed various elements, such as hydrogen and nitrogen, to the mysterious &quot;beryllium radiation&quot;, and by measuring the energies of the recoiling charged particles, he deduced that the radiation was actually composed of electrically neutral particles which could not be massless like the gamma ray, but instead were required to have a mass similar to that of a proton. Chadwick called this new particle &quot;the neutron&quot; and believed that it to be a proton and electron fused together because the neutron had about the same mass as a proton and an electron&#x27;s mass is negligible by comparison. Neutrons are not in fact a fusion of a proton and an electron.

==Modern quantum mechanical models==
In 1924, Louis de Broglie proposed that all particles—particularly subatomic particles such as electrons—have an associated wave. Erwin Schrödinger, fascinated by this idea, developed an equation that describes an electron as a wave function instead of a point. This approach predicted many of the spectral phenomena that Bohr&#x27;s model failed to explain, but it was difficult to visualize, and faced opposition. One of its critics, Max Born, proposed instead that Schrödinger&#x27;s wave function did not describe the physical extent of an electron (like a charge distribution in classical electromagnetism), but rather gave the probability that an electron would, when measured, be found at a particular point. This reconciled the ideas of wave-like and particle-like electrons: the behavior of an electron, or of any other subatomic entity, has both wave-like and particle-like aspects, and whether one aspect or the other is observed depend upon the experiment.

A consequence of describing particles as waveforms rather than points is that it is mathematically impossible to calculate with precision both the position and momentum of a particle at a given point in time. This became known as the uncertainty principle, a concept first introduced by Werner Heisenberg in 1927.

Schrödinger&#x27;s wave model for hydrogen replaced Bohr&#x27;s model, with its neat, clearly defined circular orbits. The modern model of the atom describes the positions of electrons in an atom in terms of probabilities. An electron can potentially be found at any distance from the nucleus, but, depending on its energy level and angular momentum, exists more frequently in certain regions around the nucleus than others; this pattern is referred to as its atomic orbital. The orbitals come in a variety of shapes—sphere, dumbbell, torus, etc.—with the nucleus in the middle. The shapes of atomic orbitals are found by solving the Schrödinger equation. Analytic solutions of the Schrödinger equation are known for very few relatively simple model Hamiltonians including the hydrogen atom and the hydrogen molecular ion. Beginning with the helium atom—which contains just two electrons—numerical methods are used to solve the Schrödinger equation.

Qualitatively the shape of the atomic orbitals of multi-electron atoms resemble the states of the hydrogen atom. The Pauli principle requires the distribution of these electrons within the atomic orbitals such that no more than two electrons are assigned to any one orbital; this requirement profoundly affects the atomic properties and ultimately the bonding of atoms into molecules.

<doc id="2847" wikidata="Q36740" url="?curid=2847" title="Aung San Suu Kyi">
<text>Daw Aung San Suu Kyi (born 19 June 1945) is a Burmese politician, diplomat, author, and political activist who served as State Counsellor of Myanmar and Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2016 to 2021. She has served as the general secretary of the National League for Democracy (NLD) since the party&#x27;s founding in 1988 and was registered as its chairperson while it was a legal party from 2011 to 2023. She played a vital role in Myanmar&#x27;s transition from military junta to partial democracy in the 2010s.

The youngest daughter of Aung San, Father of the Nation of modern-day Myanmar, and Khin Kyi, Aung San Suu Kyi was born in Rangoon, British Burma. After graduating from the University of Delhi in 1964 and St Hugh&#x27;s College, Oxford in 1968, she worked at the United Nations for three years. She married Michael Aris in 1972, with whom she had two children.

Aung San Suu Kyi rose to prominence in the 8888 Uprising of 8 August 1988 and became the General Secretary of the NLD, which she had newly formed with the help of several retired army officials who criticised the military junta. In the 1990 general election, NLD won 81% of the seats in Parliament, but the results were nullified, as the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), the military government, refused to hand over power, resulting in an international outcry. She had been detained before the elections and remained under house arrest for almost 15 of the 21 years from 1989 to 2010, becoming one of the world&#x27;s most prominent political prisoners. In 1999, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named her one of the &quot;Children of Gandhi&quot; and his spiritual heir to nonviolence. She survived an assassination attempt in the 2003 Depayin massacre when at least 70 people associated with the NLD were killed.

Her party boycotted the 2010 general election, resulting in a decisive victory for the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP). Aung San Suu Kyi became a member of the Pyithu Hluttaw (House of Representatives) while her party won 43 of the 45 vacant seats in the 2012 by-elections. In the 2015 general election, her party won a landslide victory, taking 86% of the seats in the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw, well more than the 67% supermajority needed to ensure that its preferred candidates were elected president and vice president in the Presidential Electoral College. Although she was prohibited from becoming the president due to a clause in the Myanmar Constitution—her late husband and children are foreign citizens—she assumed the newly created role of State Counsellor of Myanmar, a role akin to a prime minister or a head of government.

When she ascended to the office of state counsellor, Aung San Suu Kyi drew criticism from several countries, organisations and figures over Myanmar&#x27;s inaction in response to the Rohingya genocide in Rakhine State and refusal to acknowledge that the Tatmadaw (armed forces) had committed massacres. Under her leadership, Myanmar also drew criticism for prosecutions of journalists. In 2019, Aung San Suu Kyi appeared in the International Court of Justice where she defended the Myanmar military against allegations of genocide against the Rohingya people.

Aung San Suu Kyi, whose party had won the November 2020 general election, was arrested on 1 February 2021 following a coup d&#x27;état that returned the Tatmadaw to power and sparked protests across the country. Several charges were filed against her, and on 6 December 2021, she was sentenced to four years in prison on two of them. Later, on 10 January 2022, she was sentenced to an additional four years on another set of charges. On 12 October 2022, she was convicted of two further charges of corruption and she was sentenced to two terms of three years&#x27; imprisonment to be served concurrent to each other. On 30 December 2022, her trials ended with another conviction and an additional sentence of seven years&#x27; imprisonment for corruption. Aung San Suu Kyi&#x27;s final sentence was of 33 years in prison, later reduced to 27 years. The United Nations, most European countries, and the United States condemned the arrests, trials, and sentences as politically motivated.

== Name ==
&quot;Aung San Suu Kyi&quot;, like other Burmese names, includes no surname, but is only a personal name, in her case derived from three relatives: &quot;Aung San&quot; from her father, &quot;Suu&quot; from her paternal grandmother, and &quot;Kyi&quot; from her mother Khin Kyi.

In Myanmar, Aung San Suu Kyi is often referred to as &quot;Daw&quot; Aung San Suu Kyi. &quot;Daw&quot;, literally meaning &quot;aunt&quot;, is not part of her name but is an honorific for any older and revered woman, akin to &quot;Madam&quot;. She is sometimes addressed as Daw Suu or Amay Suu (&quot;Mother Suu&quot;) by her supporters.

== Personal life ==

Aung San Suu Kyi was born on 19 June 1945 in Rangoon (now Yangon), British Burma. According to Peter Popham, she was born in a small village outside Rangoon called Hmway Saung. Her father, Aung San, allied with the Japanese during World War II. Aung San founded the modern Burmese army and negotiated Burma&#x27;s independence from the United Kingdom in 1947; he was assassinated by his rivals in the same year. She is a niece of Thakin Than Tun who was the husband of Khin Khin Gyi, the elder sister of her mother Khin Kyi.

She grew up with her mother, Khin Kyi, and two brothers, Aung San Lin and Aung San Oo, in Rangoon. Aung San Lin died at the age of eight when he drowned in an ornamental lake on the grounds of the house. Her elder brother emigrated to San Diego, California, becoming a United States citizen. After Aung San Lin&#x27;s death, the family moved to a house by Inya Lake where Aung San Suu Kyi met people of various backgrounds, political views, and religions. She was educated in Methodist English High School (now Basic Education High School No. 1 Dagon) for much of her childhood in Burma, where she was noted as having a talent for learning languages. She speaks four languages: Burmese, English (with a British accent), French, and Japanese. She is a Theravada Buddhist.

Aung San Suu Kyi&#x27;s mother, Khin Kyi, gained prominence as a political figure in the newly formed Burmese government. She was appointed Burmese ambassador to India and Nepal in 1960, and Aung San Suu Kyi followed her there. She studied in the Convent of Jesus and Mary School in New Delhi, and graduated from Lady Shri Ram College, a constituent college of the University of Delhi in New Delhi, with a degree in politics in 1964. Suu Kyi continued her education at St Hugh&#x27;s College, Oxford, obtaining a B.A. degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics in 1967, graduating with a third-class degree that was promoted per tradition to an MA in 1968. After graduating, she lived in New York City with family friend Ma Than E, who was once a popular Burmese pop singer. She worked at the United Nations for three years, primarily on budget matters, writing daily to her future husband, Dr. Michael Aris. On 1 January 1972, Aung San Suu Kyi and Aris, a scholar of Tibetan culture and literature, living abroad in Bhutan, were married. The following year, she gave birth to their first son, Alexander Aris, in London; their second son, Kim Aris, was born in 1977. Between 1985 and 1987, Aung San Suu Kyi was working toward a Master of Philosophy degree in Burmese literature as a research student at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), University of London. She was elected as an Honorary Fellow of St Hugh&#x27;s in 1990. For two years, she was a Fellow at the Indian Institute of Advanced Studies (IIAS) in Shimla, India. She also worked for the government of the Union of Burma.

In 1988, Aung San Suu Kyi returned to Burma to tend for her ailing mother. Aris&#x27; visit in Christmas 1995 was the last time that he and Aung San Suu Kyi met, as she remained in Burma and the Burmese dictatorship denied him any further entry visas. Aris was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1997 which was later found to be terminal. Despite appeals from prominent figures and organisations, including the United States, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Pope John Paul II, the Burmese government would not grant Aris a visa, saying that they did not have the facilities to care for him, and instead urged Aung San Suu Kyi to leave the country to visit him. She was at that time temporarily free from house arrest but was unwilling to depart, fearing that she would be refused re-entry if she left, as she did not trust the military junta&#x27;s assurance that she could return.

Aris died on his 53rd birthday on 27 March 1999. Since 1989, when his wife was first placed under house arrest, he had seen her only five times, the last of which was for Christmas in 1995. She was also separated from her children, who live in the United Kingdom, until 2011.

On 2 May 2008, after Cyclone Nargis hit Burma, Aung San Suu Kyi&#x27;s dilapidated lakeside bungalow lost its roof and electricity, while the cyclone also left entire villages in the Irrawaddy delta submerged. Plans to renovate and repair the house were announced in August 2009. Aung San Suu Kyi was released from house arrest on 13 November 2010.

== Political career ==
=== Political beginning ===
Coincidentally, when Aung San Suu Kyi returned to Burma in 1988, the long-time military leader of Burma and head of the ruling party, General Ne Win, stepped down. Mass demonstrations for democracy followed that event on 8 August 1988 (8-8-88, a day seen as auspicious), which were violently suppressed in what came to be known as the 8888 Uprising. On 24 August 1988, she made her first public appearance at the Yangon General Hospital, addressing protestors from a podium. On 26 August, she addressed half a million people at a mass rally in front of the Shwedagon Pagoda in the capital, calling for a democratic government. However, in September 1988, a new military junta took power.

Influenced by both Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s philosophy of non-violence and also by the Buddhist concepts, Aung San Suu Kyi entered politics to work for democratisation, helped found the National League for Democracy on 27 September 1988, but was put under house arrest on 20 July 1989. She was offered freedom if she left the country, but she refused. Despite her philosophy of non-violence, a group of ex-military commanders and senior politicians who joined NLD during the crisis believed that she was too confrontational and left NLD. However, she retained enormous popularity and support among NLD youths with whom she spent most of her time.
During the crisis, the previous democratically elected Prime Minister of Burma, U Nu, initiated to form an interim government and invited opposition leaders to join him. Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had signaled his readiness to recognize the interim government. However, Aung San Suu Kyi categorically rejected U Nu&#x27;s plan by saying &quot;the future of the opposition would be decided by masses of the people&quot;. Ex-Brigadier General Aung Gyi, another influential politician at the time of the 8888 Uprising and the first chairman in the history of the NLD, followed the suit and rejected the plan after Aung San Suu Kyi&#x27;s refusal. Aung Gyi later accused several NLD members of being communists and resigned from the party.

===1990 general election and Nobel Peace Prize===
In 1990, the military junta called a general election, in which the NLD received 59% of the votes, guaranteeing NLD 80% of the parliament seats. Some claim that Aung San Suu Kyi would have assumed the office of Prime Minister. Instead, the results were nullified and the military refused to hand over power, resulting in an international outcry. Aung San Suu Kyi was placed under house arrest at her home on University Avenue () in Rangoon, during which time she was awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought in 1990, and the Nobel Peace Prize one year later. Her sons Alexander and Kim Aris accepted the Nobel Peace Prize on her behalf. Aung San Suu Kyi used the Nobel Peace Prize&#x27;s US$1.3 million prize money to establish a health and education trust for the Burmese people. Around this time, Aung San Suu Kyi chose non-violence as an expedient political tactic, stating in 2007, &quot;I do not hold to nonviolence for moral reasons, but for political and practical reasons.&quot;

The decision of the Nobel Committee mentions:

In 1995 Aung San Suu Kyi delivered the keynote address at the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing.

===1996 attack===
On 9 November 1996, the motorcade that Aung San Suu Kyi was traveling in with other National League for Democracy leaders Tin Oo and Kyi Maung, was attacked in Yangon. About 200 men swooped down on the motorcade, wielding metal chains, metal batons, stones and other weapons. The car that Aung San Suu Kyi was in had its rear window smashed, and the car with Tin Oo and Kyi Maung had its rear window and two backdoor windows shattered. It is believed the offenders were members of the Union Solidarity and Development Association (USDA) who were allegedly paid Ks.500/- (@ USD $0.50) each to participate. The NLD lodged an official complaint with the police, and according to reports the government launched an investigation, but no action was taken. (Amnesty International 120297)

===House arrest===
Aung San Suu Kyi was placed under house arrest for a total of 15 years over a 21-year period, on numerous occasions, since she began her political career, during which time she was prevented from meeting her party supporters and international visitors. In an interview, she said that while under house arrest she spent her time reading philosophy, politics and biographies that her husband had sent her. She also passed the time playing the piano and was occasionally allowed visits from foreign diplomats as well as from her personal physician.

Although under house arrest, Aung San Suu Kyi was granted permission to leave Burma under the condition that she never return, which she refused: &quot;As a mother, the greater sacrifice was giving up my sons, but I was always aware of the fact that others had given up more than me. I never forget that my colleagues who are in prison suffer not only physically, but mentally for their families who have no security outside—in the larger prison of Burma under authoritarian rule.&quot;

The media were also prevented from visiting Aung San Suu Kyi, as occurred in 1998 when Italian journalist Maurizio Giuliano, after photographing her, was stopped by customs officials who then confiscated all his films, tapes and some notes. In contrast, Aung San Suu Kyi did have visits from government representatives, such as during her autumn 1994 house arrest when she met the leader of Burma, Senior General Than Shwe and General Khin Nyunt on 20 September in the first meeting since she had been placed in detention. On several occasions during her house arrest, she had periods of poor health and as a result was hospitalised.

The Burmese government detained and kept Aung San Suu Kyi imprisoned because it viewed her as someone &quot;likely to undermine the community peace and stability&quot; of the country, and used both Article 10(a) and 10(b) of the 1975 State Protection Act (granting the government the power to imprison people for up to five years without a trial), and Section 22 of the &quot;Law to Safeguard the State Against the Dangers of Those Desiring to Cause Subversive Acts&quot; as legal tools against her. She continuously appealed her detention, and many nations and figures continued to call for her release and that of 2,100 other political prisoners in the country. On 12 November 2010, days after the junta-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) won elections conducted after a gap of 20 years, the junta finally agreed to sign orders allowing Aung San Suu Kyi&#x27;s release, and her house arrest term came to an end on 13 November 2010.

===United Nations involvement===
The United Nations (UN) has attempted to facilitate dialogue between the junta and Aung San Suu Kyi. On 6 May 2002, following secret confidence-building negotiations led by the UN, the government released her; a government spokesman said that she was free to move &quot;because we are confident that we can trust each other&quot;. Aung San Suu Kyi proclaimed &quot;a new dawn for the country&quot;. However, on 30 May 2003 in an incident similar to the 1996 attack on her, a government-sponsored mob attacked her caravan in the northern village of Depayin, murdering and wounding many of her supporters. Aung San Suu Kyi fled the scene with the help of her driver, Kyaw Soe Lin, but was arrested upon reaching Ye-U. The government imprisoned her at Insein Prison in Rangoon. After she underwent a hysterectomy in September 2003, the government again placed her under house arrest in Rangoon.

The results from the UN facilitation have been mixed; Razali Ismail, UN special envoy to Burma, met with Aung San Suu Kyi. Ismail resigned from his post the following year, partly because he was denied re-entry to Burma on several occasions. Several years later in 2006, Ibrahim Gambari, UN Undersecretary-General (USG) of Department of Political Affairs, met with Aung San Suu Kyi, the first visit by a foreign official since 2004. He also met with her later the same year. On 2 October 2007 Gambari returned to talk to her again after seeing Than Shwe and other members of the senior leadership in Naypyidaw. State television broadcast Aung San Suu Kyi with Gambari, stating that they had met twice. This was Aung San Suu Kyi&#x27;s first appearance in state media in the four years since her current detention began.

The United Nations Working Group for Arbitrary Detention published an Opinion that Aung San Suu Kyi&#x27;s deprivation of liberty was arbitrary and in contravention of Article 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948, and requested that the authorities in Burma set her free, but the authorities ignored the request at that time. The U.N. report said that according to the Burmese Government&#x27;s reply, &quot;Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has not been arrested, but has only been taken into protective custody, for her own safety&quot;, and while &quot;it could have instituted legal action against her under the country&#x27;s domestic legislation ... it has preferred to adopt a magnanimous attitude, and is providing her with protection in her own interests&quot;.

Such claims were rejected by Brigadier-General Khin Yi, Chief of Myanmar Police Force (MPF). On 18 January 2007, the state-run paper &quot;New Light of Myanmar&quot; accused Aung San Suu Kyi of tax evasion for spending her Nobel Prize money outside the country. The accusation followed the defeat of a US-sponsored United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Burma as a threat to international security; the resolution was defeated because of strong opposition from China, which has strong ties with the military junta (China later voted against the resolution, along with Russia and South Africa).

In November 2007, it was reported that Aung San Suu Kyi would meet her political allies National League for Democracy along with a government minister. The ruling junta made the official announcement on state TV and radio just hours after UN special envoy Ibrahim Gambari ended his second visit to Burma. The NLD confirmed that it had received the invitation to hold talks with Aung San Suu Kyi. However, the process delivered few concrete results.

On 3 July 2009, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon went to Burma to pressure the junta into releasing Aung San Suu Kyi and to institute democratic reform. However, on departing from Burma, Ban Ki-moon said he was &quot;disappointed&quot; with the visit after junta leader Than Shwe refused permission for him to visit Aung San Suu Kyi, citing her ongoing trial. Ban said he was &quot;deeply disappointed that they have missed a very important opportunity&quot;.

* 13 November 2010: Released from house arrest.

===2007 anti-government protests===

Protests led by Buddhist monks during Saffron Revolution began on 19 August 2007 following steep fuel price increases, and continued each day, despite the threat of a crackdown by the military.

On 22 September 2007, although still under house arrest, Aung San Suu Kyi made a brief public appearance at the gate of her residence in Yangon to accept the blessings of Buddhist monks who were marching in support of human rights. It was reported that she had been moved the following day to Insein Prison (where she had been detained in 2003), but meetings with UN envoy Ibrahim Gambari near her Rangoon home on 30 September and 2 October established that she remained under house arrest.

===2009 trespass incident===

On 3 May 2009, an American man, identified as John Yettaw, swam across Inya Lake to her house uninvited and was arrested when he made his return trip three days later. He had attempted to make a similar trip two years earlier, but for unknown reasons was turned away. He later claimed at trial that he was motivated by a divine vision requiring him to notify her of an impending terrorist assassination attempt. On 13 May, Aung San Suu Kyi was arrested for violating the terms of her house arrest because the swimmer, who pleaded exhaustion, was allowed to stay in her house for two days before he attempted the swim back. Aung San Suu Kyi was later taken to Insein Prison, where she could have faced up to five years&#x27; confinement for the intrusion. The trial of Aung San Suu Kyi and her two maids began on 18 May and a small number of protesters gathered outside. Diplomats and journalists were barred from attending the trial; however, on one occasion, several diplomats from Russia, Thailand and Singapore and journalists were allowed to meet Aung San Suu Kyi. The prosecution had originally planned to call 22 witnesses. It also accused John Yettaw of embarrassing the country. During the ongoing defence case, Aung San Suu Kyi said she was innocent. The defence was allowed to call only one witness (out of four), while the prosecution was permitted to call 14 witnesses. The court rejected two character witnesses, NLD members Tin Oo and Win Tin, and permitted the defence to call only a legal expert. According to one unconfirmed report, the junta was planning to, once again, place her in detention, this time in a military base outside the city. In a separate trial, Yettaw said he swam to Aung San Suu Kyi&#x27;s house to warn her that her life was &quot;in danger&quot;. The national police chief later confirmed that Yettaw was the &quot;main culprit&quot; in the case filed against Aung San Suu Kyi. According to aides, Aung San Suu Kyi spent her 64th birthday in jail sharing biryani rice and chocolate cake with her guards.

Her arrest and subsequent trial received worldwide condemnation by the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations Security Council, Western governments, South Africa, Japan and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, of which Burma is a member. The Burmese government strongly condemned the statement, as it created an &quot;unsound tradition&quot; and criticised Thailand for meddling in its internal affairs. The Burmese Foreign Minister Nyan Win was quoted in the state-run newspaper &quot;New Light of Myanmar&quot; as saying that the incident &quot;was trumped up to intensify international pressure on Burma by internal and external anti-government elements who do not wish to see the positive changes in those countries&#x27; policies toward Burma&quot;. Ban responded to an international campaign by flying to Burma to negotiate, but Than Shwe rejected all of his requests.

On 11 August 2009, the trial concluded with Aung San Suu Kyi being sentenced to imprisonment for three years with hard labour. This sentence was commuted by the military rulers to further house arrest of 18 months. On 14 August, US Senator Jim Webb visited Burma, visiting with junta leader General Than Shwe and later with Aung San Suu Kyi. During the visit, Webb negotiated Yettaw&#x27;s release and deportation from Burma. Following the verdict of the trial, lawyers of Aung San Suu Kyi said they would appeal against the 18-month sentence. On 18 August, United States President Barack Obama asked the country&#x27;s military leadership to set free all political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi. In her appeal, Aung San Suu Kyi had argued that the conviction was unwarranted. However, her appeal against the August sentence was rejected by a Burmese court on 2 October 2009. Although the court accepted the argument that the 1974 constitution, under which she had been charged, was null and void, it also said the provisions of the 1975 security law, under which she has been kept under house arrest, remained in force. The verdict effectively meant that she would be unable to participate in the elections scheduled to take place in 2010—the first in Burma in two decades. Her lawyer stated that her legal team would pursue a new appeal within 60 days.

===Late 2000s: International support for release ===


Aung San Suu Kyi has received vocal support from Western nations in Europe, Australia and North and South America, as well as India, Israel, Japan the Philippines and South Korea. In December 2007, the US House of Representatives voted unanimously 400–0 to award Aung San Suu Kyi the Congressional Gold Medal; the Senate concurred on 25 April 2008. On 6 May 2008, President George W. Bush signed legislation awarding Aung San Suu Kyi the Congressional Gold Medal. She is the first recipient in American history to receive the prize while imprisoned. More recently, there has been growing criticism of her detention by Burma&#x27;s neighbours in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), particularly from Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and Singapore. At one point Malaysia warned Burma that it faced expulsion from ASEAN as a result of the detention of Aung San Suu Kyi. Other nations including South Africa, Bangladesh and the Maldives also called for her release. The United Nations has urged the country to move towards inclusive national reconciliation, the restoration of democracy, and full respect for human rights. In December 2008, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution condemning the human rights situation in Burma and calling for Aung San Suu Kyi&#x27;s release—80 countries voting for the resolution, 25 against and 45 abstentions. Other nations, such as China and Russia, are less critical of the regime and prefer to cooperate only on economic matters. Indonesia has urged China to push Burma for reforms. However, Samak Sundaravej, former Prime Minister of Thailand, criticised the amount of support for Aung San Suu Kyi, saying that &quot;Europe uses Aung San Suu Kyi as a tool. If it&#x27;s not related to Aung San Suu Kyi, you can have deeper discussions with Myanmar.&quot;

Vietnam, however, did not support calls by other ASEAN member states for Myanmar to free Aung San Suu Kyi, state media reported Friday, 14 August 2009. The state-run Việt Nam News said Vietnam had no criticism of Myanmar&#x27;s decision 11 August 2009 to place Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest for the next 18 months, effectively barring her from elections scheduled for 2010. &quot;It is our view that the Aung San Suu Kyi trial is an internal affair of Myanmar&quot;, Vietnamese government spokesman Le Dung stated on the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In contrast with other ASEAN member states, Dung said Vietnam has always supported Myanmar and hopes it will continue to implement the &quot;roadmap to democracy&quot; outlined by its government.

Nobel Peace Prize winners (Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the Dalai Lama, Shirin Ebadi, Adolfo Pérez Esquivel, Mairead Corrigan, Rigoberta Menchú, Prof. Elie Wiesel, US President Barack Obama, Betty Williams, Jody Williams and former US President Jimmy Carter) called for the rulers of Burma to release Aung San Suu Kyi to &quot;create the necessary conditions for a genuine dialogue with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and all concerned parties and ethnic groups to achieve an inclusive national reconciliation with the direct support of the United Nations&quot;. Some of the money she received as part of the award helped fund higher education grants to Burmese students through the London-based charity Prospect Burma.

It was announced prior to the 2010 Burmese general election that Aung San Suu Kyi may be released &quot;so she can organize her party&quot;, However, Aung San Suu Kyi was not allowed to run. On 1 October 2010 the government announced that she would be released on 13 November 2010.

US President Barack Obama personally advocated the release of all political prisoners, especially Aung San Suu Kyi, during the US-ASEAN Summit of 2009.

The US Government hoped that successful general elections would be an optimistic indicator of the Burmese government&#x27;s sincerity towards eventual democracy. The Hatoyama government which spent 2.82 billion yen in 2008, has promised more Japanese foreign aid to encourage Burma to release Aung San Suu Kyi in time for the elections; and to continue moving towards democracy and the rule of law.

In a personal letter to Aung San Suu Kyi, UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown cautioned the Burmese government of the potential consequences of rigging elections as &quot;condemning Burma to more years of diplomatic isolation and economic stagnation&quot;.

Aung San Suu Kyi met with many heads of state and opened a dialog with the Minister of Labor Aung Kyi (not to be confused with Aung San Suu Kyi). She was allowed to meet with senior members of her NLD party at the State House, however these meetings took place under close supervision.

===2010 release===
On the evening of 13 November 2010, Aung San Suu Kyi was released from house arrest. This was the date her detention had been set to expire according to a court ruling in August 2009 and came six days after a widely criticised general election. She appeared in front of a crowd of her supporters, who rushed to her house in Rangoon when nearby barricades were removed by the security forces. Aung San Suu Kyi had been detained for 15 of the past 21 years. The government newspaper &quot;New Light of Myanmar&quot; reported the release positively, saying she had been granted a pardon after serving her sentence &quot;in good conduct&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; suggested that the military government may have released Aung San Suu Kyi because it felt it was in a confident position to control her supporters after the election.
Her son Kim Aris was granted a visa in November 2010 to see his mother shortly after her release, for the first time in 10 years. He visited again on 5 July 2011, to accompany her on a trip to Bagan, her first trip outside Yangon since 2003. Her son visited again on 8 August 2011, to accompany her on a trip to Pegu, her second trip.

Discussions were held between Aung San Suu Kyi and the Burmese government during 2011, which led to a number of official gestures to meet her demands. In October, around a tenth of Burma&#x27;s political prisoners were freed in an amnesty and trade unions were legalised.

In November 2011, following a meeting of its leaders, the NLD announced its intention to re-register as a political party to contend 48 by-elections necessitated by the promotion of parliamentarians to ministerial rank. Following the decision, Aung San Suu Kyi held a telephone conference with US President Barack Obama, in which it was agreed that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would make a visit to Burma, a move received with caution by Burma&#x27;s ally China. On 1 December 2011, Aung San Suu Kyi met with Hillary Clinton at the residence of the top-ranking US diplomat in Yangon.

On 21 December 2011, Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra met Aung San Suu Kyi in Yangon, marking Aung San Suu Kyi&#x27;s &quot;first-ever meeting with the leader of a foreign country&quot;.

On 5 January 2012, British Foreign Minister William Hague met Aung San Suu Kyi and his Burmese counterpart. This represented a significant visit for Aung San Suu Kyi and Burma. Aung San Suu Kyi studied in the UK and maintains many ties there, whilst Britain is Burma&#x27;s largest bilateral donor.
During Aung San Suu Kyi&#x27;s visit to Europe, she visited the Swiss parliament, collected her 1991 Nobel Prize in Oslo and her honorary degree from the University of Oxford.

===2012 by-elections===
In December 2011, there was speculation that Aung San Suu Kyi would run in the 2012 national by-elections to fill vacant seats. On 18 January 2012, Aung San Suu Kyi formally registered to contest a Pyithu Hluttaw (lower house) seat in the Kawhmu Township constituency in special parliamentary elections to be held on 1 April 2012. The seat was previously held by Soe Tint, who vacated it after being appointed Construction Deputy Minister, in the 2010 election. She ran against Union Solidarity and Development Party candidate Soe Min, a retired army physician and native of Twante Township.

On 3 March 2012, at a large campaign rally in Mandalay, Aung San Suu Kyi unexpectedly left after 15 minutes, because of exhaustion and airsickness.

In an official campaign speech broadcast on Burmese state television&#x27;s MRTV on 14 March 2012, Aung San Suu Kyi publicly campaigned for reform of the 2008 Constitution, removal of restrictive laws, more adequate protections for people&#x27;s democratic rights, and establishment of an independent judiciary. The speech was leaked online a day before it was broadcast. A paragraph in the speech, focusing on the Tatmadaw&#x27;s repression by means of law, was censored by authorities.

Aung San Suu Kyi also called for international media to monitor the by-elections, while publicly pointing out irregularities in official voter lists, which include deceased individuals and exclude other eligible voters in the contested constituencies. On 21 March 2012, Aung San Suu Kyi was quoted as saying &quot;Fraud and rule violations are continuing and we can even say they are increasing.&quot;

When asked whether she would assume a ministerial post if given the opportunity, she said the following:

On 26 March 2012, Aung San Suu Kyi suspended her nationwide campaign tour early, after a campaign rally in Myeik (Mergui), a coastal town in the south, citing health problems due to exhaustion and hot weather.
On 1 April 2012, the NLD announced that Aung San Suu Kyi had won the vote for a seat in Parliament. A news broadcast on state-run MRTV, reading the announcements of the Union Election Commission, confirmed her victory, as well as her party&#x27;s victory in 43 of the 45 contested seats, officially making Aung San Suu Kyi the Leader of the Opposition in the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw.

Although she and other MP-elects were expected to take office on 23 April when the Hluttaws resumed session, National League for Democracy MP-elects, including Aung San Suu Kyi, said they might not take their oaths because of its wording; in its present form, parliamentarians must vow to &quot;safeguard&quot; the constitution. In an address on Radio Free Asia, she said &quot;We don&#x27;t mean we will not attend the parliament, we mean we will attend only after taking the oath ... Changing that wording in the oath is also in conformity with the Constitution. I don&#x27;t expect there will be any difficulty in doing it.&quot;

On 2 May 2012, National League for Democracy MP-elects, including Aung San Suu Kyi, took their oaths and took office, though the wording of the oath was not changed. According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;Suu Kyi and her colleagues decided they could do more by joining as lawmakers than maintaining their boycott on principle.&quot;
On 9 July 2012, she attended the Parliament for the first time as a lawmaker.

===2015 general election===
On 16 June 2012, Aung San Suu Kyi was finally able to deliver her Nobel acceptance speech (Nobel lecture) at Oslo&#x27;s City Hall, two decades after being awarded the peace prize. In September 2012, Aung San Suu Kyi received in person the United States Congressional Gold Medal, which is the highest Congressional award. Although she was awarded this medal in 2008, at the time she was under house arrest, and was unable to receive the medal. Aung San Suu Kyi was greeted with bipartisan support at Congress, as part of a coast-to-coast tour in the United States. In addition, Aung San Suu Kyi met President Barack Obama at the White House. The experience was described by Aung San Suu Kyi as &quot;one of the most moving days of my life&quot;. In 2014, she was listed as the 61st-most-powerful woman in the world by &quot;Forbes&quot;.

On 6 July 2012, Aung San Suu Kyi announced on the World Economic Forum&#x27;s website that she wanted to run for the presidency in Myanmar&#x27;s 2015 elections. The current Constitution, which came into effect in 2008, bars her from the presidency because she is the widow and mother of foreigners—provisions that appeared to be written specifically to prevent her from being eligible.

The NLD won a sweeping victory in those elections, winning at least 255 seats in the House of Representatives and 135 seats in the House of Nationalities. In addition, Aung San Suu Kyi won re-election to the House of Representatives. Under the 2008 constitution, the NLD needed to win at least a two-thirds majority in both houses to ensure that its candidate would become president. Before the elections, Aung San Suu Kyi announced that even though she is constitutionally barred from the presidency, she would hold the real power in any NLD-led government. On 30 March 2016 she became Minister for the President&#x27;s Office, for Foreign Affairs, for Education and for Electric Power and Energy in President Htin Kyaw&#x27;s government; later she relinquished the latter two ministries and President Htin Kyaw appointed her State Counsellor, a position akin to a Prime Minister created especially for her. The position of State Counsellor was approved by the House of Nationalities on 1 April 2016 and the House of Representatives on 5 April 2016. The next day, her role as State Counsellor was established.

===State counsellor and foreign minister (2016–2021)===

As soon as she became foreign minister, she invited Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Canadian Foreign Minister Stephane Dion and Italian Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni in April and Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida in May and discussed how to have good diplomatic relationships with these countries.
Initially, upon accepting the State Counsellor position, she granted amnesty to the students who were arrested for opposing the National Education Bill, and announced the creation of the commission on Rakhine State, which had a long record of persecution of the Muslim Rohingya minority. However, soon Aung San Suu Kyi&#x27;s government did not manage with the ethnic conflicts in Shan and Kachin states, where thousands of refugees fled to China, and by 2017 the persecution of the Rohingya by the government forces escalated to the point that it is not uncommonly called a genocide. Aung San Suu Kyi, when interviewed, has denied the allegations of ethnic cleansing. She has also refused to grant citizenship to the Rohingya, instead taking steps to issue ID cards for residency but no guarantees of citizenship.

Her tenure as State Counsellor of Myanmar has drawn international criticism for her failure to address her country&#x27;s economic and ethnic problems, particularly the plight of the Rohingya following the 25 August 2017 ARSA attacks (described as &quot;certainly one of the biggest refugee crises and cases of ethnic cleansing since the Second World War&quot;), for the weakening of freedom of the press and for her style of leadership, described as imperious and &quot;distracted and out of touch&quot;.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in Myanmar, Suu Kyi chaired a National Central Committee responsible for coordinating the country&#x27;s pandemic response.

====Response to the genocide of Rohingya Muslims and refugees====
In 2017, critics called for Aung San Suu Kyi&#x27;s Nobel prize to be revoked, citing her silence over the genocide of Rohingya people in Myanmar. Some activists criticised Aung San Suu Kyi for her silence on the 2012 Rakhine State riots (later repeated during the 2015 Rohingya refugee crisis), and her indifference to the plight of the Rohingya, Myanmar&#x27;s persecuted Muslim minority. In 2012, she told reporters she did not know if the Rohingya could be regarded as Burmese citizens. In a 2013 interview with the BBC&#x27;s Mishal Husain, Aung San Suu Kyi did not condemn violence against the Rohingya and denied that Muslims in Myanmar have been subject to ethnic cleansing, insisting that the tensions were due to a &quot;climate of fear&quot; caused by &quot;a worldwide perception that global Muslim power is &#x27;very great. She did condemn &quot;hate of any kind&quot; in the interview. According to Peter Popham, in the aftermath of the interview, she expressed anger at being interviewed by a Muslim. Husain had challenged Aung San Suu Kyi that almost all of the impact of violence was against the Rohingya, in response to Aung San Suu Kyi&#x27;s claim that violence was happening on both sides, and Peter Popham described her position on the issue as one of purposeful ambiguity for political gain.

However, she said that she wanted to work towards reconciliation and she cannot take sides as violence has been committed by both sides. According to &quot;The Economist&quot;, her &quot;halo has even slipped among foreign human-rights lobbyists, disappointed at her failure to make a clear stand on behalf of the Rohingya minority&quot;. However, she has spoken out &quot;against a ban on Rohingya families near the Bangladeshi border having more than two children&quot;.

In a 2015 BBC News article, reporter Jonah Fisher suggested that Aung San Suu Kyi&#x27;s silence over the Rohingya issue is due to a need to obtain support from the majority Bamar ethnicity as she is in &quot;the middle of a general election campaign&quot;. In May 2015, the Dalai Lama publicly called upon her to do more to help the Rohingya in Myanmar, claiming that he had previously urged her to address the plight of the Rohingya in private during two separate meetings and that she had resisted his urging. In May 2016, Aung San Suu Kyi asked the newly appointed United States Ambassador to Myanmar, Scot Marciel, not to refer to the Rohingya by that name as they &quot;are not recognized as among the 135 official ethnic groups&quot; in Myanmar. This followed Bamar protests at Marciel&#x27;s use of the word &quot;Rohingya&quot;.

In 2016, Aung San Suu Kyi was accused of failing to protect Myanmar&#x27;s Rohingya Muslims during the Rohingya genocide. State crime experts from Queen Mary University of London warned that Aung San Suu Kyi is &quot;legitimising genocide&quot; in Myanmar. Despite continued persecution of the Rohingya well into 2017, Aung San Suu Kyi was &quot;not even admitting, let alone trying to stop, the army&#x27;s well-documented campaign of rape, murder and destruction against Rohingya villages&quot;. On 4 September 2017, Yanghee Lee, the UN&#x27;s special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, criticised Aung San Suu Kyi&#x27;s response to the &quot;really grave&quot; situation in Rakhine, saying: &quot;The de facto leader needs to step in—that is what we would expect from any government, to protect everybody within their own jurisdiction.&quot; The BBC reported that &quot;Her comments came as the number of Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh reached 87,000, according to UN estimates&quot;, adding that &quot;her sentiments were echoed by Nobel Peace laureate Malala Yousafzai, who said she was waiting to hear from Ms Suu Kyi—who has not commented on the crisis since it erupted&quot;. The next day George Monbiot, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, called on readers to sign a change.org petition to have the Nobel peace prize revoked, criticising her silence on the matter and asserting &quot;whether out of prejudice or out of fear, she denies to others the freedoms she rightly claimed for herself. Her regime excludes—and in some cases seeks to silence—the very activists who helped to ensure her own rights were recognised.&quot; The Nobel Foundation replied that there existed no provision for revoking a Nobel Prize. Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a fellow peace prize holder, also criticised Aung San Suu Kyi&#x27;s silence: in an open letter published on social media, he said: &quot;If the political price of your ascension to the highest office in Myanmar is your silence, the price is surely too steep ... It is incongruous for a symbol of righteousness to lead such a country.&quot; On 13 September it was revealed that Aung San Suu Kyi would not be attending a UN General Assembly debate being held the following week to discuss the humanitarian crisis, with a Myanmar&#x27;s government spokesman stating &quot;perhaps she has more pressing matters to deal with&quot;.

In October 2017, Oxford City Council announced that, following a unanimous cross-party vote, the honour of Freedom of the City, granted in 1997 in recognition of her &quot;long struggle for democracy&quot;, was to be withdrawn following evidence emerging from the United Nations which meant that she was &quot;no longer worthy of the honour&quot;. A few days later, Munsur Ali, a councillor for City of London Corporation, tabled a motion to rescind the Freedom of the City of London: the motion was supported by Catherine McGuinness, chair of the corporation&#x27;s policy and resources committee, who expressed &quot;distress ... at the situation in Burma and the atrocities committed by the Burmese military&quot;. On 13 November 2017, Bob Geldof returned his Freedom of the City of Dublin award in protest over Aung San Suu Kyi also holding the accolade, stating that he does not &quot;wish to be associated in any way with an individual currently engaged in the mass ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya people of north-west Burma&quot;. Calling Aung San Suu Kyi a &quot;handmaiden to genocide&quot;, Geldof added that he would take pride in his award being restored if it is first stripped from her. The Dublin City Council voted 59–2 (with one abstention) to revoke Aung San Suu Kyi&#x27;s Freedom of the City award over Myanmar&#x27;s treatment of the Rohingya people in December 2017, though Lord Mayor of Dublin Mícheál Mac Donncha denied the decision was influenced by protests by Geldof and members of U2. At the same meeting, the Councillors voted 37–7 (with 5 abstentions) to remove Geldof&#x27;s name from the Roll of Honorary Freemen.

In March 2018, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum revoked Aung San Suu Kyi&#x27;s Elie Wiesel Award, awarded in 2012, citing her failure &quot;to condemn and stop the military&#x27;s brutal campaign&quot; against Rohingya Muslims.

In May 2018, Aung San Suu Kyi was considered complicit in the crimes against Rohingyas in a report by Britain&#x27;s International Development Committee.
In August 2018, it was revealed that Aung San Suu Kyi would be stripped of her Freedom of Edinburgh award over her refusal to speak out against the crimes committed against the Rohingya. She had received the award in 2005 for promoting peace and democracy in Burma. This will be only the second time that anyone has ever been stripped of the award, after Charles Stewart Parnell lost it in 1890 due to a salacious affair. Also in August, a UN report, while describing the violence as genocide, added that Aung San Suu Kyi did as little as possible to prevent it.

In early October 2018, both the Canadian Senate and its House of Commons voted unanimously to strip Aung San Suu Kyi of her honorary citizenship. This decision was caused by the Government of Canada&#x27;s determination that the treatment of the Rohingya by Myanmar&#x27;s government amounts to genocide.

On 11 November 2018, Amnesty International announced it was revoking her Ambassador of Conscience award.
In December 2019, Aung San Suu Kyi appeared in the International Court of Justice at The Hague where she defended the Burmese military against allegations of genocide against the Rohingya. In a speech of over 3,000 words, Aung San Suu Kyi did not use the term &quot;Rohingya&quot; in describing the ethnic group. She stated that the allegations of genocide were &quot;incomplete and misleading&quot;, claiming that the situation was actually a Burmese military response to attacks by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA). She also questioned how there could be &quot;genocidal intent&quot; when the Burmese government had opened investigations and also encouraged Rohingya to return after being displaced. However, experts have largely criticised the Burmese investigations as insincere, with the military declaring itself innocent and the government preventing a visit from investigators from the United Nations. Many Rohingya have also not returned due to perceiving danger and a lack of rights in Myanmar.

In January 2020, the International Court of Justice decided that there was a &quot;real and imminent risk of irreparable prejudice to the rights&quot; of the Rohingya. The court also took the view that the Burmese government&#x27;s efforts to remedy the situation &quot;do not appear sufficient&quot; to protect the Rohingya. Therefore, the court ordered the Burmese government to take &quot;all measures within its power&quot; to protect the Rohingya from genocidal actions. The court also instructed the Burmese government to preserve evidence and report back to the court at timely intervals about the situation.

On 14 February 2025, a court in Argentina, acting on a petition from the Burmese Rohingya Organisation UK and citing universal jurisdiction, issued arrest warrants against several officials in Myanmar, including Aung San Suu Kyi on charges of &quot;genocide and crimes against humanity&quot; against the Rohingyas.

====Arrests and prosecution of journalists====
In December 2017, two Reuters journalists, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, were arrested while investigating the Inn Din massacre of Rohingyas. Suu Kyi publicly commented in June 2018 that the journalists &quot;weren&#x27;t arrested for covering the Rakhine issue&quot;, but because they had broken Myanmar&#x27;s Official Secrets Act. As the journalists were then on trial for violating the Official Secrets Act, Aung San Suu Kyi&#x27;s presumption of their guilt was criticised by rights groups for potentially influencing the verdict. American diplomat Bill Richardson said that he had privately discussed the arrest with Suu Kyi, and that Aung San Suu Kyi reacted angrily and labelled the journalists &quot;traitors&quot;. A police officer testified that he was ordered by superiors to use entrapment to frame and arrest the journalists; he was later jailed and his family evicted from their home in the police camp. The judge found the journalists guilty in September 2018 and to be jailed for seven years. Aung San Suu Kyi reacted to widespread international criticism of the verdict by stating: &quot;I don&#x27;t think anyone has bothered to read&quot; the judgement as it had &quot;nothing to do with freedom of expression at all&quot;, but the Official Secrets Act. She also challenged critics to &quot;point out where there has been a miscarriage of justice&quot;, and told the two Reuters journalists that they could appeal their case to a higher court.

In September 2018, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights issued a report that since Aung San Suu Kyi&#x27;s party, the NLD, came to power, the arrests and criminal prosecutions of journalists in Myanmar by the government and military, under laws which are too vague and broad, have &quot;made it impossible for journalists to do their job without fear or favour.&quot;

===2021 arrest and trial===


On 1 February 2021, Aung San Suu Kyi was arrested and deposed by the Myanmar&#x27;s military, along with other leaders of her National League for Democracy (NLD) party, after Myanmar&#x27;s military declared the November 2020 general election results fraudulent. A 1 February court order authorised her detainment for 15 days, stating that soldiers searching her Naypyidaw villa had uncovered imported communications equipment lacking proper paperwork. Aung San Suu Kyi was transferred to house arrest on the same evening, and on 3 February was formally charged with illegally importing ten or more walkie-talkies. She faces up to three years in prison for the charges. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the charge &quot;echoed previous accusations of esoteric legal crimes (and) arcane offenses&quot; used by the military against critics and rivals. As of 9 February, Aung San Suu Kyi continues to be held incommunicado, without access to international observers or legal representation of her choice.

US President Joe Biden raised the threat of new sanctions as a result of the Myanmar&#x27;s military coup. In a statement, the UN Secretary-General António Guterres believes &quot;These developments represent a serious blow to democratic reforms in Myanmar.&quot; Volkan Bozkır, President of the UN General Assembly, also voiced his concerns, having tweeted &quot;Attempts to undermine democracy and rule of law are unacceptable&quot;, and called for the &quot;immediate release&quot; of the detained NLD party leaders.

On 1 April 2021, Aung San Suu Kyi was charged with the fifth offence in relation to violating the official secrets act. According to her lawyer, it is the most serious charge brought against her after the coup and could carry a sentence of up to 14 years in prison if convicted. On 12 April 2021, Aung San Suu Kyi was hit with another charge, this time &quot;under section 25 of the natural disaster management law&quot;. According to her lawyer, it is her sixth indictment. She appeared in court via video link and now faces five charges in the capital Naypyidaw and one in Yangon.

On 28 April 2021, the National Unity Government (NUG), in which Aung San Suu Kyi symbolically retained her position, anticipated that there would be no talks with the junta until all political prisoners, including her, are set free. This move by her supporters come after an ASEAN-supported consensus with the junta leadership in the past days. However, on 8 May 2021, the junta designated NUG as a terrorist organisation and warned citizens not to cooperate, nor to give aid to the parallel government, stripping Aung San Suu Kyi of her symbolic position. On 10 May 2021, her lawyer said she would appear in court in person for the first time since her arrest after the Supreme Court ruled that she could attend in person and meet her lawyers. She had been previously only allowed to do so remotely from her home. On 21 May 2021, a military junta commission was formed to dissolve Aung San Suu Kyi&#x27;s National League for Democracy (NLD) on grounds of election fraud in the November 2020 election. On 22 May 2021, during his first interview since the coup, junta leader Min Aung Hlaing reported that she was in good health at her home and that she would appear in court in a matter of days. On 23 May 2021, the European Union expressed support for Aung San Suu Kyi&#x27;s party and condemned the commission aimed at dissolving the party, echoing the NLD&#x27;s statement released earlier in the week.

On 24 May 2021, Aung San Suu Kyi appeared in person in court for the first time since the coup to face the &quot;incitement to sedition&quot; charge against her. During the 30-minute hearing, she said that she was not fully aware of what was going on outside as she had no access to full information from the outside and refused to respond on the matters. She was also quoted on the possibility of her party&#x27;s forced dissolution as &quot;Our party grew out of the people so it will exist as long as people support it.&quot; In her meeting with her lawyers, Aung San Suu Kyi also wished people &quot;good health&quot;.

On 2 June 2021, it was reported that the military had moved her (as well as Win Myint) from their homes to an unknown location.

On 10 June 2021, Aung San Suu Kyi was charged with corruption, the most serious charge brought against her, which carries a maximum penalty of 15 years&#x27; imprisonment. Aung San Suu Kyi&#x27;s lawyers say the charges are made to keep her out of the public eye.

On 14 June 2021, the trial against Aung San Suu Kyi began. Any conviction would prevent her from running for office again. Aung San Suu Kyi&#x27;s lawyers attempted to have prosecution testimony against her on the sedition charge disqualified but the motion was denied by the judge.

On 13 September 2021, court proceedings were to resume against her, but it was postponed due to Aung San Suu Kyi presenting &quot;minor health issues&quot; that impeded her from attending the court in person.

On 4 October 2021, Aung San Suu Kyi asked the judge to reduce her times of court appearances because of her fragile health. Aung San Suu Kyi described her health as &quot;strained&quot;.

In November, the Myanmar courts deferred the first verdicts in the trial without further explanation or giving dates. In the same month, she was again charged with corruption, related to the purchase and rental of a helicopter, bringing the total of charges to nearly a dozen.

On 6 December 2021, Suu Kyi was sentenced to 4 years in jail. Suu Kyi, who is still facing multiple charges and further sentences, was sentenced on the charge of inciting dissent and violating COVID-19 protocols. Following a partial pardon by the chief of the military government, Aung San Suu Kyi&#x27;s four-year sentence was reduced to two years&#x27; imprisonment.

On 10 January 2022, the military court in Myanmar sentenced Suu Kyi to an additional four years in prison on a number of charges including &quot;importing and owning walkie-talkies&quot; and &quot;breaking coronavirus rules&quot;. The trials, which are closed to the public, the media, and any observers, were described as a &quot;courtroom circus of secret proceedings on bogus charges&quot; by the deputy director for Asia of Human Rights Watch.

On 27 April 2022, Aung San Suu Kyi was sentenced to five years in jail on corruption charges.

On 22 June 2022, junta authorities ordered that all further legal proceedings against Suu Kyi will take place in prison venues, instead of a courtroom. No explanation of the decision was given. Citing unidentified sources, the BBC reported that Suu Kyi was also moved on 22 June from house arrest, where she had had close companions, to solitary confinement in a specially-built area inside a prison in Naypyidaw. This is the same prison in which Win Myint had similarly been placed in solitary confinement. The military confirmed that Suu Kyi had been moved to prison.

On 15 August 2022, sources following Aung San Suu Kyi&#x27;s court proceedings said that she was sentenced to an additional six years&#x27; imprisonment after being found guilty on four corruption charges, bringing her overall sentences to 17 years in prison. In September 2022, she was convicted of election fraud and breaching the state&#x27;s secrets act and sentenced to a total of six years in prison for both convictions, increasing her overall sentence to 23 years in prison. By 12 October 2022, she had been sentenced to 26 years imprisonment on ten charges in total, including five corruption charges. On 30 December 2022, her trials ended with another conviction and an additional sentence of seven years&#x27; imprisonment for corruption. Aung San Suu Kyi&#x27;s final sentence is of 33 years in prison.

On 12 July 2023, Thailand&#x27;s foreign minister Don Pramudwinai said at the ASEAN Foreign Ministers&#x27; Meeting in Jakarta that he met with Aung San Suu Kyi during his visit to Myanmar. On 1 August 2023, the military junta granted Suu Kyi a partial pardon, reducing her sentence to a total of 27 years in prison. Prior to the pardon, she was moved from prison to a VIP government residence, according to an official from NLD party.

However, it was reported that since the beginning of September 2023, she is back in prison. The exact time when she was sent back to prison is unknown. Since January, Aung San Suu Kyi and her lawyers are trying to get six corruption charges overturned. To this date, the requests are repeatedly denied.

On 16 April 2024, the military announced that Aung San Suu Kyi had been transferred to house arrest due to a heat wave. However, pro-democracy publications such as &quot;The Irrawaddy&quot; claimed that she remains in prison, with air conditioners being added to her cell.

==Political beliefs==
Asked what democratic models Myanmar could look to, she said: &quot;We have many, many lessons to learn from various places, not just the Asian countries like South Korea, Taiwan, Mongolia, and Indonesia.&quot; She also cited &quot;Eastern Europe and countries, which made the transition from communist autocracy to democracy in the 1980s and 1990s, and the Latin American countries, which made the transition from military governments. And we cannot of course forget South Africa, because although it wasn&#x27;t a military regime, it was certainly an authoritarian regime.&quot; She added: &quot;We wish to learn from everybody who has achieved a transition to democracy, and also ... our great strong point is that, because we are so far behind everybody else, we can also learn which mistakes we should avoid.&quot;

In a nod to the deep US political divide between Republicans led by Mitt Romney and the Democrats by Barack Obama—then battling to win the 2012 presidential election—she stressed, &quot;Those of you who are familiar with American politics I&#x27;m sure understand the need for negotiated compromise.&quot;

==In popular culture==

The life of Aung San Suu Kyi and her husband Michael Aris is portrayed in Luc Besson&#x27;s 2011 film &quot;The Lady&quot;, in which they are played by Michelle Yeoh and David Thewlis. Yeoh visited Aung San Suu Kyi in 2011 before the film&#x27;s release in November. In the John Boorman&#x27;s 1995 film &quot;Beyond Rangoon&quot;, Aung San Suu Kyi was played by Adelle Lutz.

Irish songwriters Damien Rice and Lisa Hannigan released in 2005 the single &quot;Unplayed Piano&quot;, in support of the Free Aung San Suu Kyi 60th Birthday Campaign that was happening at the time.

Irish rock band U2 wrote the song &quot;Walk On&quot; in tribute to Aung San Suu Kyi. It is the fourth track on their tenth studio album, &quot;All That You Can&#x27;t Leave Behind&quot; (2000), and would later be issued as a single. Lead singer Bono is wearing a t-shirt with her image and name on the front in their official video of the song. &quot;Walk On&quot; won Record of the Year at the 2002 Grammy Awards, that also featured U2 performing the song. Bono publicised her plight during the U2 360° Tour, 2009–2011.

Saxophonist Wayne Shorter composed a song titled &quot;Aung San Suu Kyi&quot;. It appears on his albums &quot;1+1&quot; (with pianist Herbie Hancock) and &quot;Footprints Live!&quot;.

==Health problems==
Aung San Suu Kyi underwent surgery for a gynecological condition in September 2003 at Asia Royal Hospital during her house arrest. She also underwent minor foot surgery in December 2013 and eye surgery in April 2016. In June 2012, her doctor Tin Myo Win said that she had no serious health problems, but weighed only , had low blood pressure, and could become weak easily.
After being arrested and detained on 1 February 2021, there were concerns that Aung San Suu Kyi&#x27;s health was deteriorating. However, according to military&#x27;s spokesperson Zaw Min Tun, special attention is given to her health and living condition. Don Pramudwinai also said that &quot;she was in good health, both physically and mentally&quot;.

Although a junta spokesperson claimed that she is in good health, since being sent back to prison in September 2023, it is reported that her health condition is worsening and she is &quot;suffering of toothache and unable to eat&quot;. Her request to see a dentist had been denied. Her son is urging the junta to allow Aung San Suu Kyi to receive medical assistance.

<text>Abraham Joshua Heschel (January 11, 1907 – December 23, 1972) was a Polish-American rabbi and one of the leading Jewish theologians and Jewish philosophers of the 20th century. Heschel, a professor of Jewish mysticism at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, authored a number of widely read books on Jewish philosophy and was a leader in the U.S. civil rights movement.

==Biography==
Abraham Joshua Heschel was born in Warsaw in 1907, the youngest of six children of Moshe Mordechai Heschel and Reizel Perlow Heschel. He was descended from preeminent European rabbis on both sides of his family. His paternal great-great-grandfather and namesake was Rebbe Avraham Yehoshua Heshel of Apt in present-day Poland. His mother was also a descendant of Avraham Yehoshua Heshel and other Hasidic dynasties. His siblings were Sarah, Dvora Miriam, Esther Sima, Gittel, and Jacob. Their father Moshe died of influenza in 1916 when Abraham was nine. He was tutored by a Gerrer Hasid who introduced him to the thought of Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Kotzk.

After a traditional yeshiva education and studying for Orthodox rabbinical ordination (semicha), Heschel pursued his doctorate at the University of Berlin and rabbinic ordination at the non-denominational Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums. There he studied under notable scholars including Hanoch Albeck, Ismar Elbogen, Julius Guttmann, Alexander Guttmann, and Leo Baeck. His mentor in Berlin was David Koigen. Heschel later taught Talmud at the Hochschule. He joined a Yiddish poetry group, Jung Vilna, and in 1933, published a volume of Yiddish poems, &quot;Der Shem Hamefoyrosh: Mentsch,&quot; dedicated to his father.

In late October 1938, while living in a rented room in the home of a Jewish family in Frankfurt, Heschel was arrested by the Gestapo and deported to Poland in the Polenaktion. He spent ten months lecturing on Jewish philosophy and Torah at Warsaw&#x27;s Institute for Jewish Studies. Six weeks before the German invasion of Poland, Heschel fled Warsaw for London with the help of Julian Morgenstern, president of Hebrew Union College, and Alexander Guttmann, an eventual colleague at the Hebrew Union College, who secretly re-wrote Heschel&#x27;s ordination certificate to meet American visa requirements.

Heschel&#x27;s sister Esther was killed in a German bombing. His mother was murdered by the Nazis, and two other sisters, Gittel and Devorah, died in Nazi concentration camps. He never returned to Germany, Austria or Poland. He once wrote, &quot;If I should go to Poland or Germany, every stone, every tree would remind me of contempt, hatred, murder, of children killed, of mothers burned alive, of human beings asphyxiated.&quot;

Heschel arrived in New York City in March 1940. He soon left for Cincinnati, serving on the faculty of Hebrew Union College (HUC), the main seminary of Reform Judaism, for five years. In 1946 he returned to New York, taking a position with the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTS), the main seminary of Conservative Judaism. He remained with JTS as professor of Jewish ethics and Mysticism until his death in 1972. At the time of his death, Heschel lived near JTS at 425 Riverside Drive in Manhattan.

Heschel married Sylvia Straus, a concert pianist, on December 10, 1946, in Los Angeles. Their daughter, Susannah Heschel, became a Jewish scholar in her own right.

==Ideology==

Heschel explicated many facets of Jewish thought, including studies on medieval Jewish philosophy, Kabbalah, and Hasidic philosophy. According to some scholars, he was more interested in spirituality than in critical text study; the latter was a specialty of many scholars at JTS. He was not given a graduate assistant for many years and he was mainly relegated to teach in the education school or the Rabbinical school, not in the academic graduate program. Heschel became friendly with his colleague Mordecai Kaplan. Though they differed in their approaches to Judaism, they had a very cordial relationship and visited each other&#x27;s homes from time to time.

Heschel believed that the teachings of the Hebrew prophets were a clarion call for social action in the United States and, inspired by this belief, he worked for African Americans&#x27; civil rights and spoke out against the Vietnam War.

He also criticized what he specifically called &quot;pan-halakhism,&quot; or an exclusive focus upon religiously compatible behavior to the neglect of the non-legalistic dimension of rabbinic tradition.

Heschel is notable as a recent proponent of what one scholar calls the &quot;Nachmanidean&quot; school of Jewish thought - emphasizing the mutually dependent relationship between God and man - as opposed to the &quot;Maimonidean&quot; school in which God is independent and unchangeable. In Heschel&#x27;s language, the &quot;Maimonidean&quot; perspective is associated with Rabbi Yishmael and the &quot;Nachmanidean&quot; perspective with Rabbi Akiva; according to Heschel neither perspective should be adopted in isolation, but rather both are interwoven with the other.

Heschel described kabbalah as an outgrowth of classical rabbinic sources that describe God&#x27;s dependence on man to implement the divine plan for the world. This contrasts with scholars like Gershon Scholem who saw kabbalah as reflecting the influence of non-Jewish thought. While Scholem&#x27;s school focused on the metaphysics and history of kabbalistic thought, Heschel focused on kabbalistic descriptions of the human religious experience. In recent years, a growing body of kabbalah scholarship has followed Heschel&#x27;s emphasis on the mystical experience of kabbalah and on its continuity with earlier Jewish sources.

==Influence outside Judaism==

Heschel is a widely read Jewish theologian whose most influential works include &quot;Man Is Not Alone&quot;, &quot;God in Search of Man&quot;, &quot;The Sabbath,&quot; and &quot;The Prophets&quot;. As a representative of American Jews at the Second Vatican Council, Heschel persuaded the Catholic Church to eliminate or modify passages in its liturgy that demeaned Jews, or referred to an expected conversion of the Jewish people to Christianity. His theological works argued that religious experience is a fundamentally human impulse, not just a Jewish one. He believed that no religious community could claim a monopoly on religious truth. For these and other reasons, Martin Luther King Jr. called Heschel &quot;a truly great prophet.&quot; Heschel actively participated in the Civil Rights movement, and was a participant in the third Selma to Montgomery march, accompanying Dr. King and John Lewis.

===&quot;Man Is Not Alone&quot; (1951)===
&quot;Man Is Not Alone: A Philosophy of Religion&quot; offers Heschel&#x27;s views on how people can comprehend God. Judaism views God as being radically different from humans, so Heschel explores the ways that Judaism teaches that a person may have an encounter with the ineffable. A recurring theme in this work is the radical amazement people feel when experiencing the presence of the Divine. Heschel then explores the problems of doubts and faith, what Judaism means by teaching that God is one, the essence of humanity and the problem of human needs, the definition of religion in general and Judaism in particular, and human yearning for spirituality. He offers his views as to Judaism being a pattern for life.

===&quot;The Sabbath&quot; (1951)===
&quot;The Sabbath: Its Meaning for Modern Man&quot; is a work on the nature and celebration of Shabbat, the Jewish Sabbath. It is rooted in the thesis that Judaism is a religion of time, not space, and that the Sabbath symbolizes the sanctification of time. For Heschel, &quot;Technical civilization is man&#x27;s conquest of space. It is a triumph frequently achieved by sacrificing an essential ingredient of existence, namely, time.” While he wrote that “to enhance our power in the world of space is our main objective,” he also warned that while “we have often suffered from degradation by poverty, now we are threatened with degradation through power.&quot;

===&quot;God in Search of Man&quot; (1955)===
&quot;God in Search of Man: A Philosophy of Judaism&quot; is a companion volume to &quot;Man Is Not Alone&quot; in which Heschel discusses the nature of religious thought, how thought becomes faith, and how faith creates responses in the believer. He discusses ways people can seek God&#x27;s presence and the radical amazement we receive in return. He offers a criticism of nature worship, a study of humanity&#x27;s metaphysical loneliness, and his view that we can consider God in search of humanity. The first section concludes with a study of Jews as a chosen people. Section two deals with the idea of revelation and what it means for one to be a prophet. This section gives us his idea of revelation as an event instead of a process. This relates to Israel&#x27;s commitment to God. Section three discusses his views on how a Jew should understand the nature of Judaism as a religion. He discusses and rejects the idea that mere faith (without law) alone is enough but then cautions rabbis against adding too many restrictions to Jewish law. He discusses the need to correlate ritual observance with spirituality and love and the importance of Kavanah (intention) when performing mitzvot. He discusses religious behaviorism—when people strive for external compliance with the law, yet disregard the importance of inner devotion.

===&quot;The Prophets&quot; (1962)===
This work started as Heschel&#x27;s PhD thesis in German, which he later expanded and translated into English. Originally published in a two-volume edition, &quot;The Prophets&quot; studies the books of the Hebrew prophets. It covers their lives and the historical context of their missions, summarizes their work, and discusses their psychological state. Heschel puts forward a central idea in his theology: that the prophetic (and, ultimately, Jewish) view of God is best understood not as anthropomorphic (that God takes human form) but as anthropopathic—that God has human feelings.

In &quot;The Prophets&quot;, Heschel describes the Jewish prophets&#x27; unique aspect compared to similar figures. Whereas other nations have soothsayers and diviners who attempt to discover the will of their gods, Heschel asserts, the Hebrew prophets are characterized by their experience of what he calls theotropism—God turning towards humanity. Heschel argues for the view of Hebrew prophets as receivers of the &quot;Divine Pathos,&quot; of the wrath and sorrow of God over his nation that has forsaken him. In this view, prophets do not speak for God so much as they remind their audience of God&#x27;s voice for the voiceless, the poor, and the oppressed.

He writes:
=== &quot;Torah min HaShamayim&quot; (1962) ===
Many consider Heschel&#x27;s &quot;Torah min HaShamayim BeAspaklariya shel HaDorot&quot;, (&quot;Torah from Heaven in the mirror of the generations&quot;) to be his masterwork. The three volumes of this work are a study of classical rabbinic theology and aggadah, as opposed to halakha (Jewish law). It explores the views of the rabbis in the Mishnah, Talmud, and Midrash about the nature of Torah, the revelation of God to humankind, prophecy, and the ways that Jews have used scriptural exegesis to expand and understand these core Jewish texts. In this work, Heschel views the 2nd-century sages Rabbi Akiva and Ishmael ben Elisha as paradigms for the two dominant world-views in Jewish theology

Two Hebrew volumes were published during his lifetime by Soncino Press, and the third was published posthumously by JTS Press in the 1990s. A new edition, including an expanded third volume, due to manuscripts that were found and edited by Dr. Dror Bondi, was published by Magid Press in 2021. An English translation of all three volumes, with notes, essays, and appendices, was translated and edited by Rabbi Gordon Tucker, entitled &quot;Heavenly Torah: As Refracted Through the Generations&quot;. It can be the subject of intense study and analysis, providing insight into the relationship between God and humans beyond the world of Judaism and all monotheisms.

=== &quot;Who is Man?&quot; (1965) ===
Here, Heschel discusses the nature and role of man. In these three lectures, originally delivered in somewhat different form as The Raymond Fred West Memorial Lectures at Stanford University in May 1963, Dr. Heschel inquires into the logic of being human: What is meant by being human? What are the grounds on which to justify a human being&#x27;s claim to being human? The author says, “We have never been as openmouthed and inquisitive, never as astonished and embarrassed at our ignorance about man. We know what he makes, but we do not know what he is or what to expect of him. Is it not conceivable that our entire civilization is built upon a misinterpretation of man? Or that the tragedy of man is due to the fact that he is a being who has forgotten the question: Who is Man? The failure to identify himself, to know what is authentic human existence, leads him to assume a false identity, to pretend to be what he is unable to be or to not accepting what is at the very root of his being. Ignorance about man is not lack of knowledge, but false knowledge.”

===&quot;Prophetic Inspiration After the Prophets&quot; (1966)===
Heschel wrote a series of articles, originally in Hebrew, on the existence of prophecy in Judaism after the destruction of the Holy Temple in Jerusalem in 70 CE. These essays were translated into English and published as &quot;Prophetic Inspiration After the Prophets: Maimonides and Others&quot; by the American Judaica publisher Ktav.

The publisher of this book states, &quot;The standard Jewish view is that prophecy ended with the ancient prophets, somewhere early in the Second Temple era. Heschel demonstrated that this view is not altogether accurate. Belief in the possibility of continued prophetic inspiration, and belief in its actual occurrence existed throughout much of the medieval period, and it even exists in modern times. Heschel&#x27;s work on prophetic inspiration in the Middle Ages originally appeared in two long Hebrew articles. In them, he concentrated on the idea that prophetic inspiration was even possible in post-Talmudic times, and, indeed, it had taken place at various schools in various times, from the Geonim to Maimonides and beyond.&quot;

== Awards and commemoration==
1970: National Jewish Book Award in the Jewish Thought category for &quot;Israel: An Echo of Eternity&quot;
Five schools have been named for Heschel: in Buenos Aires, Argentina the rabbinical school of the Seminario Rabinico Latinoamericano; on the Upper West Side of New York City, the A J Heschel School; in California the Abraham Joshua Heschel Day School is located in Northridge, while the Heschel West Day School is located in Agoura Hills; and The Toronto Heschel School in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

In 2009, a Missouri highway was named &quot;Dr. Abraham Joshua Heschel Highway&quot; to subvert the plans of a Springfield, Missouri-area Neo-Nazi group who cleaned the stretch of highway as part of an &quot;Adopt-A-Highway&quot; program. Heschel&#x27;s daughter, Susannah, has objected to the adoption of her father&#x27;s name in this context.

Heschel&#x27;s papers are held in the Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library at Duke University.

On 17 October 2022, John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin inaugurated the Abraham J. Heschel Center for Catholic-Jewish Relations, attended by Catholic and Jewish figures, including Rabbi Abraham Skorka, Susannah Heschel, Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem Archbishop Pierbattista Pizzaballa, and Archbishop Stanisław Budzik of Lublin. Pope Francis has welcomed the establishment of the Heschel Center.
