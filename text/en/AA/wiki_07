<text>Arabic (, , or , ) is a Central Semitic language of the Afroasiatic language family spoken primarily in the Arab world. The ISO assigns language codes to 32 varieties of Arabic, including its standard form of Literary Arabic, known as Modern Standard Arabic, which is derived from Classical Arabic. This distinction exists primarily among Western linguists; Arabic speakers themselves generally do not distinguish between Modern Standard Arabic and Classical Arabic, but rather refer to both as ( &quot;the eloquent Arabic&quot;) or simply &quot;&quot; ().

Arabic is the third most widespread official language after English and French, one of six official languages of the United Nations, and the liturgical language of Islam. Arabic is widely taught in schools and universities around the world and is used to varying degrees in workplaces, governments and the media. During the Middle Ages, Arabic was a major vehicle of culture and learning, especially in science, mathematics and philosophy. As a result, many European languages have borrowed words from it. Arabic influence, mainly in vocabulary, is seen in European languages (mainly Spanish and to a lesser extent Portuguese, Catalan, and Sicilian) owing to the proximity of Europe and the long-lasting Arabic cultural and linguistic presence, mainly in Southern Iberia, during the Al-Andalus era. Maltese is a Semitic language developed from a dialect of Arabic and written in the Latin alphabet. The Balkan languages, including Albanian, Greek, Serbo-Croatian, and Bulgarian, have also acquired many words of Arabic origin, mainly through direct contact with Ottoman Turkish.

Arabic has influenced languages across the globe throughout its history, especially languages where Islam is the predominant religion and in countries that were conquered by Muslims. The most markedly influenced languages are Persian, Turkish, Hindustani (Hindi and Urdu), Kashmiri, Kurdish, Bosnian, Kazakh, Bengali, Malay (Indonesian and Malaysian), Maldivian, Pashto, Punjabi, Albanian, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Sicilian, Spanish, Greek, Bulgarian, Tagalog, Sindhi, Odia, Hebrew and African languages such as Hausa, Amharic, Tigrinya, Somali, Tamazight, and Swahili. Conversely, Arabic has borrowed some words (mostly nouns) from other languages, including its sister-language Aramaic, Persian, Greek, and Latin and to a lesser extent and more recently from Turkish, English, French, and Italian.

Arabic is spoken by as many as 380 million speakers, both native and non-native, in the Arab world, making it the fifth most spoken language in the world and the fourth most used language on the internet in terms of users. It also serves as the liturgical language of more than 2 billion Muslims. In 2011, &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; ranked Arabic the fourth most useful language for business, after English, Mandarin Chinese, and French. Arabic is written with the Arabic alphabet, an abjad script that is written from right to left.

== Classification ==

Arabic is usually classified as a Central Semitic language. Linguists still differ as to the best classification of Semitic language sub-groups. The Semitic languages changed between Proto-Semitic and the emergence of Central Semitic languages, particularly in grammar. Innovations of the Central Semitic languages—all maintained in Arabic—include:
# The conversion of the suffix-conjugated stative formation (&quot;jalas-&quot;) into a past tense.
# The conversion of the prefix-conjugated preterite-tense formation (&quot;yajlis-&quot;) into a present tense.
# The elimination of other prefix-conjugated mood/aspect forms (e.g., a present tense formed by doubling the middle root, a perfect formed by infixing a after the first root consonant, probably a jussive formed by a stress shift) in favor of new moods formed by endings attached to the prefix-conjugation forms (e.g., &quot;-u&quot; for indicative, &quot;-a&quot; for subjunctive, no ending for jussive, &quot;-an&quot; or &quot;-anna&quot; for energetic).
# The development of an internal passive.
There are several features which Classical Arabic, the modern Arabic varieties, as well as the Safaitic and Hismaic inscriptions share which are unattested in any other Central Semitic language variety, including the Dadanitic and Taymanitic languages of the northern Hejaz. These features are evidence of common descent from a hypothetical ancestor, Proto-Arabic. The following features of Proto-Arabic can be reconstructed with confidence:
# negative particles &#x27; * ; &#x27; * to Classical Arabic 
# G-passive participle
# prepositions and adverbs &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &quot;
# a subjunctive in -&quot;
# &quot;-demonstratives
# leveling of the -&quot; allomorph of the feminine ending
# &quot; complementizer and subordinator
# the use of &quot;- to introduce modal clauses
# independent object pronoun in &quot;&quot;
# vestiges of &quot;nunation&quot;
On the other hand, several Arabic varieties are closer to other Semitic languages and maintain features not found in Classical Arabic, indicating that these varieties cannot have developed from Classical Arabic. Thus, Arabic vernaculars do not descend from Classical Arabic: Classical Arabic is a sister language rather than their direct ancestor.

== History ==

=== Old Arabic ===

Arabia had a wide variety of Semitic languages in antiquity. The term &quot;Arab&quot; was initially used to describe those living in the Arabian Peninsula, as perceived by geographers from ancient Greece. In the southwest, various Central Semitic languages both belonging to and outside the Ancient South Arabian family (e.g. Southern Thamudic) were spoken. It is believed that the ancestors of the Modern South Arabian languages (non-Central Semitic languages) were spoken in southern Arabia at this time. To the north, in the oases of northern Hejaz, Dadanitic and Taymanitic held some prestige as inscriptional languages. In and parts of western Arabia, a language known to scholars as Thamudic C is attested.

In eastern Arabia, inscriptions in a script derived from ASA attest to a language known as Hasaitic. On the northwestern frontier of Arabia, various languages known to scholars as Thamudic B, Thamudic D, Safaitic, and Hismaic are attested. The last two share important isoglosses with later forms of Arabic, leading scholars to theorize that Safaitic and Hismaic are early forms of Arabic and that they should be considered Old Arabic.

Linguists generally believe that &quot;Old Arabic&quot;, a collection of related dialects that constitute the precursor of Arabic, first emerged during the Iron Age. Previously, the earliest attestation of Old Arabic was thought to be a single 1st century CE inscription in Sabaic script at , in southern present-day Saudi Arabia. However, this inscription does not participate in several of the key innovations of the Arabic language group, such as the conversion of Semitic mimation to nunation in the singular. It is best reassessed as a separate language on the Central Semitic dialect continuum.

It was also thought that Old Arabic coexisted alongside—and then gradually displaced—epigraphic Ancient North Arabian (ANA), which was theorized to have been the regional tongue for many centuries. ANA, despite its name, was considered a very distinct language, and mutually unintelligible, from &quot;Arabic&quot;. Scholars named its variant dialects after the towns where the inscriptions were discovered (Dadanitic, Taymanitic, Hismaic, Safaitic). However, most arguments for a single ANA language or language family were based on the shape of the definite article, a prefixed h-. It has been argued that the h- is an archaism and not a shared innovation, and thus unsuitable for language classification, rendering the hypothesis of an ANA language family untenable. Safaitic and Hismaic, previously considered ANA, should be considered Old Arabic due to the fact that they participate in the innovations common to all forms of Arabic.

The earliest attestation of continuous Arabic text in an ancestor of the modern Arabic script are three lines of poetry by a man named Garm(&#x27;)allāhe found in En Avdat, Israel, and dated to around 125 CE. This is followed by the Namara inscription, an epitaph of the king Imru&#x27; al-Qays bar &#x27;Amro, dating to 328 CE, found at Namaraa, Syria. From the 4th to the 6th centuries, the Nabataean script evolved into the Arabic script recognizable from the early Islamic era. There are inscriptions in an undotted, 17-letter Arabic script dating to the 6th century CE, found at four locations in Syria (Zabad, Jebel Usays, Harran, ). The oldest surviving papyrus in Arabic dates to 643 CE, and it uses dots to produce the modern 28-letter Arabic alphabet. The language of that papyrus and of the Qur&#x27;an is referred to by linguists as &quot;Quranic Arabic&quot;, as distinct from its codification soon thereafter into &quot;Classical Arabic&quot;.

===Classical Arabic===
In late pre-Islamic times, a transdialectal and transcommunal variety of Arabic emerged in the Hejaz, which continued living its parallel life after literary Arabic had been institutionally standardized in the 2nd and 3rd century of the Hijra, most strongly in Judeo-Christian texts, keeping alive ancient features eliminated from the &quot;learned&quot; tradition (Classical Arabic). This variety and both its classicizing and &quot;lay&quot; iterations have been termed Middle Arabic in the past, but they are thought to continue an Old Higazi register. It is clear that the orthography of the Quran was not developed for the standardized form of Classical Arabic; rather, it shows the attempt on the part of writers to record an archaic form of Old Higazi.

In the late 6th century AD, a relatively uniform intertribal &quot;poetic koine&quot; distinct from the spoken vernaculars developed based on the Bedouin dialects of Najd, probably in connection with the court of al-Ḥīra. During the first Islamic century, the majority of Arabic poets and Arabic-writing persons spoke Arabic as their mother tongue. Their texts, although mainly preserved in far later manuscripts, contain traces of non-standardized Classical Arabic elements in morphology and syntax.

=== Standardization ===
Abu al-Aswad al-Du&#x27;ali (–689) is credited with standardizing Arabic grammar, or &quot;an-naḥw&quot; ( &quot;the way&quot;), and pioneering a system of diacritics to differentiate consonants ( &quot;nuqaṭu‿l-i&#x27;jām&quot; &quot;pointing for non-Arabs&quot;) and indicate vocalization ( &quot;at-tashkīl&quot;). Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi (718–786) compiled the first Arabic dictionary, &quot;Kitāb al-&#x27;Ayn&quot; ( &quot;The Book of the Letter ع&quot;), and is credited with establishing the rules of Arabic prosody. Al-Jahiz (776–868) proposed to Al-Akhfash al-Akbar an overhaul of the grammar of Arabic, but it would not come to pass for two centuries. The standardization of Arabic reached completion around the end of the 8th century. The first comprehensive description of the &quot;ʿarabiyya&quot; &quot;Arabic&quot;, Sībawayhi&#x27;s &quot;al&quot;-&quot;Kitāb&quot;, is based first of all upon a corpus of poetic texts, in addition to Qur&#x27;an usage and Bedouin informants whom he considered to be reliable speakers of the &quot;ʿarabiyya&quot;.

=== Spread ===
Arabic spread with the spread of Islam. Following the early Muslim conquests, Arabic gained vocabulary from Middle Persian and Turkish. In the early Abbasid period, many Classical Greek terms entered Arabic through translations carried out at Baghdad&#x27;s House of Wisdom.

By the 8th century, knowledge of Classical Arabic had become an essential prerequisite for rising into the higher classes throughout the Islamic world, both for Muslims and non-Muslims. For example, Maimonides, the Andalusi Jewish philosopher, authored works in Judeo-Arabic—Arabic written in Hebrew script.

=== Development ===
Ibn Jinni of Mosul, a pioneer in phonology, wrote prolifically in the 10th century on Arabic morphology and phonology in works such as &quot;Kitāb Al-Munṣif, Kitāb Al-Muḥtasab, and&quot; .

Ibn Mada&#x27; of Cordoba (1116–1196) realized the overhaul of Arabic grammar first proposed by Al-Jahiz 200 years prior.

The Maghrebi lexicographer Ibn Manzur compiled &quot;Lisān al-ʿArab&quot; (, &quot;Tongue of Arabs&quot;), a major reference dictionary of Arabic, in 1290.

=== Neo-Arabic ===
Charles Ferguson&#x27;s koine theory claims that the modern Arabic dialects collectively descend from a single military koine that sprang up during the Islamic conquests; this view has been challenged in recent times. Ahmad al-Jallad proposes that there were at least two considerably distinct types of Arabic on the eve of the conquests: Northern and Central (Al-Jallad 2009). The modern dialects emerged from a new contact situation produced following the conquests. Instead of the emergence of a single or multiple koines, the dialects contain several sedimentary layers of borrowed and areal features, which they absorbed at different points in their linguistic histories. According to Veersteegh and Bickerton, colloquial Arabic dialects arose from pidginized Arabic formed from contact between Arabs and conquered peoples. Pidginization and subsequent creolization among Arabs and arabized peoples could explain relative morphological and phonological simplicity of vernacular Arabic compared to Classical and MSA.

In around the 11th and 12th centuries in al-Andalus, the &quot;zajal&quot; and &quot;muwashah&quot; poetry forms developed in the dialectical Arabic of Cordoba and the Maghreb.

=== Nahda ===
The &quot;Nahda&quot; was a cultural and especially literary renaissance of the 19th century in which writers sought &quot;to fuse Arabic and European forms of expression.&quot; According to James L. Gelvin, &quot;&quot;Nahda&quot; writers attempted to simplify the Arabic language and script so that it might be accessible to a wider audience.&quot;

In the wake of the industrial revolution and European hegemony and colonialism, pioneering Arabic presses, such as the Amiri Press established by Muhammad Ali (1819), dramatically changed the diffusion and consumption of Arabic literature and publications. Rifa&#x27;a al-Tahtawi proposed the establishment of Madrasat al-Alsun in 1836 and led a translation campaign that highlighted the need for a lexical injection in Arabic, to suit concepts of the industrial and post-industrial age (such as &quot;sayyārah&quot; &#x27;automobile&#x27; or &quot;bākhirah&quot; &#x27;steamship&#x27;).

In response, a number of Arabic academies modeled after the were established with the aim of developing standardized additions to the Arabic lexicon to suit these transformations, first in Damascus (1919), then in Cairo (1932), Baghdad (1948), Rabat (1960), Amman (1977), (1993), and Tunis (1993). They review language development, monitor new words and approve the inclusion of new words into their published standard dictionaries. They also publish old and historical Arabic manuscripts.

In 1997, a bureau of Arabization standardization was added to the Educational, Cultural, and Scientific Organization of the Arab League. These academies and organizations have worked toward the Arabization of the sciences, creating terms in Arabic to describe new concepts, toward the standardization of these new terms throughout the Arabic-speaking world, and toward the development of Arabic as a world language. This gave rise to what Western scholars call Modern Standard Arabic. From the 1950s, Arabization became a postcolonial nationalist policy in countries such as Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, and Sudan.

== Classical, Modern Standard and spoken Arabic ==
&quot;Arabic&quot; usually refers to Standard Arabic, which Western linguists divide into Classical Arabic and Modern Standard Arabic. It could also refer to any of a variety of regional vernacular Arabic dialects, which are not necessarily mutually intelligible.Classical Arabic is the language found in the Quran, used from the period of Pre-Islamic Arabia to that of the Abbasid Caliphate. Classical Arabic is prescriptive, according to the syntactic and grammatical norms laid down by classical grammarians (such as Sibawayh) and the vocabulary defined in classical dictionaries (such as the &quot;Lisān al-ʻArab&quot;).

Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) largely follows the grammatical standards of Classical Arabic and uses much of the same vocabulary. However, it has discarded some grammatical constructions and vocabulary that no longer have any counterpart in the spoken varieties and has adopted certain new constructions and vocabulary from the spoken varieties. Much of the new vocabulary is used to denote concepts that have arisen in the industrial and post-industrial era, especially in modern times.

Due to its grounding in Classical Arabic, Modern Standard Arabic is removed over a millennium from everyday speech, which is construed as a multitude of dialects of this language. These dialects and Modern Standard Arabic are described by some scholars as not mutually comprehensible. The former are usually acquired in families, while the latter is taught in formal education settings. However, there have been studies reporting some degree of comprehension of stories told in the standard variety among preschool-aged children.

The relation between Modern Standard Arabic and these dialects is sometimes compared to that of Classical Latin and Vulgar Latin vernaculars (which became Romance languages) in medieval and early modern Europe.

MSA is the variety used in most current, printed Arabic publications, spoken by some of the Arabic media across North Africa and the Middle East, and understood by most educated Arabic speakers. &quot;Literary Arabic&quot; and &quot;Standard Arabic&quot; ( &quot;) are less strictly defined terms that may refer to Modern Standard Arabic or Classical Arabic.

Some of the differences between Classical Arabic (CA) and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) are as follows:
* Certain grammatical constructions of CA that have no counterpart in any modern vernacular dialect (e.g., the energetic mood) are almost never used in Modern Standard Arabic.
* Case distinctions are very rare in Arabic vernaculars. As a result, MSA is generally composed without case distinctions in mind, and the proper cases are added after the fact, when necessary. Because most case endings are noted using final short vowels, which are normally left unwritten in the Arabic script, it is unnecessary to determine the proper case of most words. The practical result of this is that MSA, like English and Standard Chinese, is written in a strongly determined word order and alternative orders that were used in CA for emphasis are rare. In addition, because of the lack of case marking in the spoken varieties, most speakers cannot consistently use the correct endings in extemporaneous speech. As a result, spoken MSA tends to drop or regularize the endings except when reading from a prepared text.
*The numeral system in CA is complex and heavily tied in with the case system. This system is never used in MSA, even in the most formal of circumstances; instead, a greatly simplified system is used, approximating the system of the conservative spoken varieties.
MSA uses much Classical vocabulary (e.g., &#x27; &#x27;to go&#x27;) that is not present in the spoken varieties, but deletes Classical words that sound obsolete in MSA. In addition, MSA has borrowed or coined many terms for concepts that did not exist in Quranic times, and MSA continues to evolve. Some words have been borrowed from other languages—notice that transliteration mainly indicates spelling and not real pronunciation (e.g., &#x27; &#x27;film&#x27; or &quot; &#x27;democracy&#x27;).

The current preference is to avoid direct borrowings, preferring to either use loan translations (e.g., &#x27; &#x27;branch&#x27;, also used for the branch of a company or organization; &#x27; &#x27;wing&#x27;, is also used for the wing of an airplane, building, air force, etc.), or to coin new words using forms within existing roots ( &#x27; &#x27;apoptosis&#x27;, using the root &quot;m/w/t&quot; &#x27;death&#x27; put into the Xth form, or &#x27; &#x27;university&#x27;, based on &#x27; &#x27;to gather, unite&#x27;; &#x27; &#x27;republic&#x27;, based on &#x27; &#x27;multitude&#x27;). An earlier tendency was to redefine an older word although this has fallen into disuse (e.g., &#x27; &#x27;telephone&#x27; &lt; &#x27;invisible caller (in Sufism)&#x27;; &quot;&quot; &#x27;newspaper&#x27; &lt; &#x27;palm-leaf stalk&#x27;).

&quot;Colloquial&quot; or &quot;dialectal&quot; Arabic refers to the many national or regional varieties which constitute the everyday spoken language. Colloquial Arabic has many regional variants; geographically distant varieties usually differ enough to be mutually unintelligible, and some linguists consider them distinct languages. However, research indicates a high degree of mutual intelligibility between closely related Arabic variants for native speakers listening to words, sentences, and texts; and between more distantly related dialects in interactional situations.The varieties are typically unwritten. They are often used in informal spoken media, such as soap operas and talk shows, as well as occasionally in certain forms of written media such as poetry and printed advertising.

Hassaniya Arabic, Maltese, and Cypriot Arabic are only varieties of modern Arabic to have acquired official recognition. Hassaniya is official in Mali and recognized as a minority language in Morocco, while the Senegalese government adopted the Latin script to write it. Maltese is official in (predominantly Catholic) Malta and written with the Latin script. Linguists agree that it is a variety of spoken Arabic, descended from Siculo-Arabic, though it has experienced extensive changes as a result of sustained and intensive contact with Italo-Romance varieties, and more recently also with English. Due to &quot;a mix of social, cultural, historical, political, and indeed linguistic factors&quot;, many Maltese people today consider their language Semitic but not a type of Arabic. Cypriot Arabic is recognized as a minority language in Cyprus.

== Status and usage ==

=== Diglossia ===
The sociolinguistic situation of Arabic in modern times provides a prime example of the linguistic phenomenon of diglossia, which is the normal use of two separate varieties of the same language, usually in different social situations. &quot;Tawleed&quot; is the process of giving a new shade of meaning to an old classical word. For example, &quot;al-hatif&quot; lexicographically means the one whose sound is heard but whose person remains unseen. Now the term &quot;al-hatif&quot; is used for a telephone. Therefore, the process of &quot;tawleed&quot; can express the needs of modern civilization in a manner that would appear to be originally Arabic.

In the case of Arabic, educated Arabs of any nationality can be assumed to speak both their school-taught Standard Arabic as well as their native dialects, which depending on the region may be mutually unintelligible. Some of these dialects can be considered to constitute separate languages which may have &quot;sub-dialects&quot; of their own. When educated Arabs of different dialects engage in conversation (for example, a Moroccan speaking with a Lebanese), many speakers code-switch back and forth between the dialectal and standard varieties of the language, sometimes even within the same sentence.
The issue of whether Arabic is one language or many languages is politically charged, in the same way it is for the varieties of Chinese, Hindi and Urdu, Serbian and Croatian, Scots and English, etc. In contrast to speakers of Hindi and Urdu who claim they cannot understand each other even when they can, speakers of the varieties of Arabic will claim they can all understand each other even when they cannot.

While there is a minimum level of comprehension between all Arabic dialects, this level can increase or decrease based on geographic proximity: for example, Levantine and Gulf speakers understand each other much better than they do speakers from the Maghreb. The issue of diglossia between spoken and written language is a complicating factor: A single written form, differing sharply from any of the spoken varieties learned natively, unites several sometimes divergent spoken forms. For political reasons, Arabs mostly assert that they all speak a single language, despite mutual incomprehensibility among differing spoken versions.

From a linguistic standpoint, it is often said that the various spoken varieties of Arabic differ among each other collectively about as much as the Romance languages. This is an apt comparison in a number of ways. The period of divergence from a single spoken form is similar—perhaps 1500 years for Arabic, 2000 years for the Romance languages. Also, while it is comprehensible to people from the Maghreb, a linguistically innovative variety such as Moroccan Arabic is essentially incomprehensible to Arabs from the Mashriq, much as French is incomprehensible to Spanish or Italian speakers but relatively easily learned by them. This suggests that the spoken varieties may linguistically be considered separate languages.

=== Status in the Arab world vis-à-vis other languages ===
With the sole example of Medieval linguist Abu Hayyan al-Gharnati – who, while a scholar of the Arabic language, was not ethnically Arab – Medieval scholars of the Arabic language made no efforts at studying comparative linguistics, considering all other languages inferior.

In modern times, the educated upper classes in the Arab world have taken a nearly opposite view. Yasir Suleiman wrote in 2011 that &quot;studying and knowing English or French in most of the Middle East and North Africa have become a badge of sophistication and modernity and ... feigning, or asserting, weakness or lack of facility in Arabic is sometimes paraded as a sign of status, class, and perversely, even education through a mélange of code-switching practises.&quot;

=== As a foreign language ===
Arabic has been taught worldwide in many elementary and secondary schools, especially Muslim schools. Universities around the world have classes that teach Arabic as part of their foreign languages, Middle Eastern studies, and religious studies courses. Arabic language schools exist to assist students to learn Arabic outside the academic world. There are many Arabic language schools in the Arab world and other Muslim countries. Because the Quran is written in Arabic and all Islamic terms are in Arabic, millions of Muslims (both Arab and non-Arab) study the language.

Software and books with tapes are an important part of Arabic learning, as many of Arabic learners may live in places where there are no academic or Arabic language school classes available. Radio series of Arabic language classes are also provided from some radio stations. A number of websites on the Internet provide online classes for all levels as a means of distance education; most teach Modern Standard Arabic, but some teach regional varieties from numerous countries.

=== Lexicography ===
==== Pre-modern Arabic lexicography ====
The tradition of Arabic lexicography extended for about a millennium before the modern period. Early lexicographers ( &quot;lughawiyyūn&quot;) sought to explain words in the Quran that were unfamiliar or had a particular contextual meaning, and to identify words of non-Arabic origin that appear in the Quran. They gathered &quot;shawāhid&quot; ( &#x27;instances of attested usage&#x27;) from poetry and the speech of the Arabs—particularly the Bedouin () who were perceived to speak the &quot;purest,&quot; most eloquent form of Arabic—initiating a process of &quot;jamʿu‿l-luɣah&quot; ( &#x27;compiling the language&#x27;) which took place over the 8th and early 9th centuries.&quot;Kitāb al-&#x27;Ayn&quot; (), attributed to Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi, is considered the first lexicon to include all Arabic roots; it sought to exhaust all possible root permutations—later called &quot;taqālīb&quot; ()&quot;—&quot;calling those that are actually used &quot;mustaʿmal&quot; () and those that are not used &quot;muhmal&quot; (). &quot;Lisān al-ʿArab&quot; (1290) by Ibn Manzur gives 9,273 roots, while &quot;Tāj al-ʿArūs&quot; (1774) by Murtada az-Zabidi gives 11,978 roots.

This lexicographic tradition was traditionalist and corrective in nature—holding that linguistic correctness and eloquence derive from Qurʾānic usage, , and Bedouin speech—positioning itself against &quot;laḥnu‿l-ʿāmmah&quot; (), the solecism it viewed as defective.

==== Western lexicography of Arabic ====
In the second half of the 19th century, the British Arabist Edward William Lane, working with the Egyptian scholar , compiled the &quot;Arabic–English Lexicon&quot; by translating material from earlier Arabic lexica into English. The German Arabist Hans Wehr, with contributions from Hedwig Klein, compiled the &quot;Arabisches Wörterbuch für die Schriftsprache der Gegenwart&quot; (1952), later translated into English as &quot;A Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic&quot; (1961), based on established usage, especially in literature.

==== Modern Arabic lexicography ====
The Academy of the Arabic Language in Cairo sought to publish a historical dictionary of Arabic in the vein of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, tracing the changes of meanings and uses of Arabic words over time. A first volume of &quot;Al-Muʿjam al-Kabīr&quot; was published in 1956 under the leadership of Taha Hussein. The project is not yet complete; its 15th volume, covering the letter &quot;ṣād&quot;, was published in 2022.

=== Loanwords ===

The most important sources of borrowings into (pre-Islamic) Arabic are from the related (Semitic) languages Aramaic, which used to be the principal, international language of communication throughout the ancient Near and Middle East, and Ethiopic. Many cultural, religious and political terms have entered Arabic from Iranian languages, notably Middle Persian, Parthian, and (Classical) Persian, and Hellenistic Greek (&quot;kīmiyāʼ&quot; has as origin the Greek &quot;khymia&quot;, meaning in that language the melting of metals; see Roger Dachez, &quot;Histoire de la Médecine de l&#x27;Antiquité au XXe siècle&quot;, Tallandier, 2008, p. 251), &quot;alembic&quot; (distiller) from &quot;ambix&quot; (cup), &quot;almanac&quot; (climate) from &quot;almenichiakon&quot; (calendar).

For the origin of the last three borrowed words, see Alfred-Louis de Prémare, &quot;Foundations of Islam&quot;, Seuil, L&#x27;Univers Historique, 2002. Some Arabic borrowings from Semitic or Persian languages are, as presented in De Prémare&#x27;s above-cited book: 
*&quot;madīnah&quot;/medina (مدينة, city or city square), a word of Aramaic origin ܡܕ݂ܝܼܢ݇ܬܵܐ &quot;məḏī(n)ttā&quot; (in which it means &quot;state/city&quot;).
*&quot;jazīrah&quot; (جزيرة), as in the well-known form الجزيرة &quot;Al-Jazeera&quot;, means &quot;island&quot; and has its origin in the Syriac ܓܵܙܲܪܬܵܐ &quot;gāzartā&quot;.
*&quot;lāzaward&quot; (لازورد) is taken from Persian لاژورد &quot;lājvard&quot;, the name of a blue stone, lapis lazuli. This word was borrowed in several European languages to mean (light) blue – azure in English, &quot;azur&quot; in French and &quot;azul&quot; in Portuguese and Spanish.
A comprehensive overview of the influence of other languages on Arabic is found in Lucas &amp; Manfredi (2020).

=== Influence on other languages ===
The influence of Arabic has been most important in Islamic countries, because it is the language of the Islamic sacred book, the Quran. Arabic is also an important source of vocabulary for languages such as Amharic, Azerbaijani, Baluchi, Bengali, Berber, Bosnian, Chaldean, Chechen, Chittagonian, Croatian, Dagestani, Dhivehi, English, German, Gujarati, Hausa, Hindi, Kazakh, Kurdish, Kutchi, Kyrgyz, Malay (Malaysian and Indonesian), Pashto, Persian, Punjabi, Rohingya, Romance languages (French, Catalan, Italian, Portuguese, Sicilian, Spanish, etc.) Saraiki, Sindhi, Somali, Sylheti, Swahili, Tagalog, Tigrinya, Turkish, Turkmen, Urdu, Uyghur, Uzbek, Visayan and Wolof, as well as other languages in countries where these languages are spoken. Modern Hebrew has been also influenced by Arabic especially during the process of revival, as MSA was used as a source for modern Hebrew vocabulary and roots.

English has many Arabic loanwords, some directly, but most via other Mediterranean languages. Examples of such words include admiral, adobe, alchemy, alcohol, algebra, algorithm, alkaline, almanac, amber, arsenal, assassin, candy, carat, cipher, coffee, cotton, ghoul, hazard, jar, kismet, lemon, loofah, magazine, mattress, sherbet, sofa, sumac, tariff, and zenith. Other languages such as Maltese and Kinubi derive ultimately from Arabic, rather than merely borrowing vocabulary or grammatical rules.

Terms borrowed range from religious terminology (like Berber &quot;taẓallit&quot;, &quot;prayer&quot;, from &quot;salat&quot; ( &#x27;)), academic terms (like Uyghur &quot;mentiq&quot;, &quot;logic&quot;), and economic items (like English &quot;coffee&quot;) to placeholders (like Spanish &#x27;, &quot;so-and-so&quot;), everyday terms (like Hindustani &quot;lekin&quot;, &quot;but&quot;, or Spanish and French &#x27;, meaning &quot;cup&quot;), and expressions (like Catalan &#x27;, &quot;galore, in quantity&quot;). Most Berber varieties (such as Kabyle), along with Swahili, borrow some numbers from Arabic. Most Islamic religious terms are direct borrowings from Arabic, such as (&quot;ṣalāh&quot;), &quot;prayer&quot;, and (&quot;imām&quot;), &quot;prayer leader&quot;.

In languages not directly in contact with the Arab world, Arabic loanwords are often transferred indirectly via other languages rather than being transferred directly from Arabic. For example, most Arabic loanwords in Hindustani and Turkish entered through Persian. Older Arabic loanwords in Hausa were borrowed from Kanuri. Most Arabic loanwords in Yoruba entered through Hausa.

Arabic words made their way into several West African languages as Islam spread across the Sahara. Variants of Arabic words such as &quot;kitāb&quot; (&quot;book&quot;) have spread to the languages of African groups who had no direct contact with Arab traders.

Since, throughout the Islamic world, Arabic occupied a position similar to that of Latin in Europe, many of the Arabic concepts in the fields of science, philosophy, commerce, etc. were coined from Arabic roots by non-native Arabic speakers, notably by Aramaic and Persian translators, and then found their way into other languages. This process of using Arabic roots, especially in Kurdish and Persian, to translate foreign concepts continued through to the 18th and 19th centuries, when swaths of Arab-inhabited lands were under Ottoman rule.

== Spoken varieties ==
&quot;Colloquial Arabic&quot; is a collective term for the spoken dialects of Arabic used throughout the Arab world, which differ radically from the literary language. The main dialectal division is between the varieties within and outside of the Arabian peninsula, followed by that between sedentary varieties and the much more conservative Bedouin varieties. All the varieties outside of the Arabian peninsula, which include the large majority of speakers, have many features in common with each other that are not found in Classical Arabic. This has led researchers to postulate the existence of a prestige koine dialect in the one or two centuries immediately following the Arab conquest, whose features eventually spread to all newly conquered areas. These features are present to varying degrees inside the Arabian peninsula. Generally, the Arabian peninsula varieties have much more diversity than the non-peninsula varieties, but these have been understudied.

Within the non-peninsula varieties, the largest difference is between the non-Egyptian North African dialects, especially Moroccan Arabic, and the others. Moroccan Arabic in particular is hardly comprehensible to Arabic speakers east of Libya (although the converse is not true, in part due to the popularity of Egyptian films and other media).

One factor in the differentiation of the dialects is influence from the languages previously spoken in the areas, which have typically provided many new words and have sometimes also influenced pronunciation or word order. However, a more weighty factor for most dialects is, as among Romance languages, retention (or change of meaning) of different classical forms. Thus Iraqi &quot;aku&quot;, Levantine and Peninsular &quot;fīh&quot; and North African &quot;kayən&quot; all mean &#x27;there is&#x27;, and all come from Classical Arabic forms (&quot;yakūn&quot;, &quot;fīhi&quot;, &quot;kā&#x27;in&quot; respectively), but now sound very different.

=== Koiné ===
According to Charles A. Ferguson, the following are some of the characteristic features of the koiné that underlies all the modern dialects outside the Arabian peninsula. Although many other features are common to most or all of these varieties, Ferguson believes that these features in particular are unlikely to have evolved independently more than once or twice and together suggest the existence of the koine:
* Loss of the dual number except on nouns, with consistent plural agreement (cf. feminine singular agreement in plural inanimates).
* Change of &quot;a&quot; to &quot;i&quot; in many affixes (e.g., non-past-tense prefixes &quot;ti- yi- ni-&quot;; &quot;wi-&quot; &#x27;and&#x27;; &quot;il-&quot; &#x27;the&#x27;; feminine &quot;-it&quot; in the construct state).
* Loss of third-weak verbs ending in &quot;w&quot; (which merge with verbs ending in &quot;y&quot;).
* Reformation of geminate verbs, e.g., &#x27; &#x27;I untied&#x27; → &#x27;.
* Conversion of separate words &quot;lī&quot; &#x27;to me&#x27;, &quot;laka&quot; &#x27;to you&#x27;, etc. into indirect-object clitic suffixes.
* Certain changes in the cardinal number system, e.g., &#x27; &#x27;five days&#x27; → &#x27;, where certain words have a special plural with prefixed &quot;t&quot;.
* Loss of the feminine elative (comparative).
* Adjective plurals of the form &#x27; &#x27;big&#x27; → &#x27;.
* Change of nisba suffix &#x27; &gt; &#x27;.
* Certain lexical items, e.g., &#x27; &#x27;bring&#x27; &lt; &#x27; &#x27;come with&#x27;; &#x27; &#x27;see&#x27;; &#x27; &#x27;what&#x27; (or similar) &lt; &#x27; &#x27;which thing&#x27;; &#x27; (relative pronoun).
* Merger of and in most or all positions.

=== Dialect groups ===
* Egyptian Arabic, spoken by 67 million people in Egypt. It is one of the most understood varieties of Arabic, due in large part to the widespread distribution of Egyptian films and television shows throughout the Arabic-speaking world.
* Levantine Arabic, spoken by about 44 million people in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Palestine, Israel, and Turkey.
** Lebanese Arabic is a variety of Levantine Arabic spoken primarily in Lebanon.
** Jordanian Arabic is a continuum of mutually intelligible varieties of Levantine Arabic spoken by the population of the Kingdom of Jordan.
** Palestinian Arabic is a name of several dialects of the subgroup of Levantine Arabic spoken by the Palestinians in Palestine, by Arab citizens of Israel and in most Palestinian populations around the world.
** Samaritan Arabic, spoken by only several hundred in the Nablus region.
* Cypriot Maronite Arabic, spoken in Cyprus by around 9,800 people (2013 UNSD).
* Maghrebi Arabic, also called &quot;Darija&quot;, spoken by about 70 million people in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya. It also forms the basis of Maltese via the extinct Sicilian Arabic dialect. Maghrebi Arabic is very hard to understand for Arabic speakers from the Mashriq or Mesopotamia, the most comprehensible being Libyan Arabic and the most difficult Moroccan Arabic. The others such as Algerian Arabic can be considered in between the two in terms of difficulty.
** Libyan Arabic, spoken in Libya and neighboring countries.
** Tunisian Arabic, spoken in Tunisia and north-eastern Algeria.
** Algerian Arabic, spoken in Algeria.
*** Judeo-Algerian Arabic was spoken by Jews in Algeria until 1962, now it is spoken by a few elderly Algerian Jews in France and Israel.
** Moroccan Arabic, spoken in Morocco.
** Hassaniya Arabic (3 million speakers), spoken in Mauritania, Western Sahara, some parts of the Azawad in northern Mali, southern Morocco, and south-western Algeria.
** Andalusian Arabic, spoken in Spain until the 16th century.
** Siculo-Arabic (Sicilian Arabic), was spoken in Sicily and Malta between the end of the 9th century and the end of the 12th century and eventually evolved into the Maltese language.
*** Maltese, spoken on the island of Malta, is the only fully separate standardized language to have originated from an Arabic dialect, the extinct Siculo-Arabic dialect, with independent literary norms. Maltese has evolved independently of Modern Standard Arabic and its varieties into a standardized language over the past 800 years in a gradual process of Latinisation. Maltese is therefore considered an exceptional descendant of Arabic that has no diglossic relationship with Standard Arabic or Classical Arabic. Maltese is different from Arabic and other Semitic languages since its morphology has been deeply influenced by Romance languages, Italian and Sicilian. It is the only Semitic language written in the Latin script. In terms of basic everyday language, speakers of Maltese are reported to be able to understand less than a third of what is said to them in Tunisian Arabic, which is related to Siculo-Arabic, whereas speakers of Tunisian are able to understand about 40% of what is said to them in Maltese. This asymmetric intelligibility is considerably lower than the mutual intelligibility found between Maghrebi Arabic dialects. Maltese has its own dialects, with urban varieties of Maltese being closer to Standard Maltese than rural varieties.
* Mesopotamian Arabic, spoken by about 41.2 million people in Iraq (where it is called &quot;Aamiyah&quot;), eastern Syria and southwestern Iran (Khuzestan) and in the southeastern of Turkey (in the eastern Mediterranean, Southeastern Anatolia Region).
**North Mesopotamian Arabic is a spoken north of the Hamrin Mountains in Iraq, in western Iran, northern Syria, and in southeastern Turkey (in the eastern Mediterranean Region, Southeastern Anatolia Region, and southern Eastern Anatolia Region).
**Judeo-Mesopotamian Arabic, also known as Iraqi Judeo Arabic and Yahudic, is a variety of Arabic spoken by Iraqi Jews of Mosul.
**Baghdad Arabic is the Arabic dialect spoken in Baghdad, and the surrounding cities and it is a subvariety of Mesopotamian Arabic.
**Baghdad Jewish Arabic is the dialect spoken by the Iraqi Jews of Baghdad.
**South Mesopotamian Arabic (Basrawi dialect) is the dialect spoken in southern Iraq, such as Basra, Dhi Qar, and Najaf.
**Khuzestani Arabic, spoken in the Iranian province of Khuzestan. This is a mix of Southern Mesopotamian Arabic and Gulf Arabic.
* Khorasani Arabic, spoken in the Iranian province of Khorasan.
*Kuwaiti Arabic is a Gulf Arabic dialect spoken in Kuwait.
* Sudanese Arabic, spoken by 17 million people in Sudan and some parts of southern Egypt. Sudanese Arabic is quite distinct from the dialect of its neighbor to the north; rather, the Sudanese have a dialect similar to the Hejazi dialect.
* Juba Arabic, spoken in South Sudan and southern far Sudan.
* Gulf Arabic, spoken by around four million people, predominantly in Kuwait, Bahrain, some parts of Oman, eastern Saudi Arabia coastal areas and some parts of UAE and Qatar. Also spoken in Iran&#x27;s Bushehr and Hormozgan provinces. Although Gulf Arabic is spoken in Qatar, most Qatari citizens speak Najdi Arabic (Bedawi).
* Omani Arabic, distinct from the Gulf Arabic of Eastern Arabia and Bahrain, spoken in Central Oman. With its oil wealth and mobility it has spread to various areas of the former Sultanate of Muscat, especially Zanzibar and the Swahili Coast.
* Hadhrami Arabic, spoken by around 8 million people, predominantly in Hadhramaut, and in parts of the Arabian Peninsula, South and Southeast Asia, and East Africa by Hadhrami descendants.
** Indonesian Arabic, spoken in Arab ethnic enclaves in Indonesia, especially along the north coast of Java. It has about 60,000 speakers according to a rough estimate in 2010.
* Yemeni Arabic, spoken in Yemen, and southern Saudi Arabia by 15 million people. Similar to Gulf Arabic.
* Najdi Arabic, spoken by around 10 million people, mainly spoken in Najd, central and northern Saudi Arabia. Most Qatari citizens speak Najdi Arabic (Bedawi).
* Hejazi Arabic (6 million speakers), spoken in Hejaz, western Saudi Arabia.
* Saharan Arabic spoken in some parts of Algeria, Niger and Mali.
* Baharna Arabic (800,000 speakers), spoken by Bahrani Shias in Bahrain and Qatif, the dialect exhibits many big differences from Gulf Arabic. It is also spoken to a lesser extent in Oman.
* Judeo-Arabic dialects – these are the dialects spoken by the Jews that had lived or continue to live in the Arab World. As Jewish migration to Israel took hold, the language did not thrive and is now considered endangered. So-called Qəltu Arabic.
* Chadian Arabic, spoken in Chad, Sudan, some parts of South Sudan, Central African Republic, Niger, Nigeria, and Cameroon.
* Central Asian Arabic, spoken in Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Afghanistan by around 8,000 people. Tajiki Arabic is highly endangered.
* Shirvani Arabic, spoken in Azerbaijan and Dagestan until the 1930s, now extinct.

== Phonology ==
While many languages have numerous dialects that differ in phonology, contemporary spoken Arabic is more properly described as a continuum of varieties. Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), is the standard variety shared by educated speakers throughout Arabic-speaking regions. MSA is used in writing in formal print media and orally in newscasts, speeches and formal declarations of numerous types.

Modern Standard Arabic has 28 consonant phonemes and 6 vowel phonemes. All phonemes contrast between &quot;emphatic&quot; (pharyngealized) consonants and non-emphatic ones. Some of these phonemes have coalesced in the various modern dialects, while new phonemes have been introduced through borrowing or phonemic splits. A &quot;phonemic quality of length&quot; applies to consonants as well as vowels.

== Grammar ==

The grammar of Arabic has similarities with the grammar of other Semitic languages. Some of the typical differences between Standard Arabic () and vernacular varieties are a loss of morphological markings of grammatical case, changes in word order, a shift toward more analytic morphosyntax, loss of grammatical mood, and loss of the inflected passive voice.

=== Literary Arabic ===

As in other Semitic languages, Arabic has a complex and unusual morphology, i.e. method of constructing words from a basic root. Arabic has a nonconcatenative &quot;root-and-pattern&quot; morphology: A root consists of a set of bare consonants (usually three), which are fitted into a discontinuous pattern to form words. For example, the word for &#x27;I wrote&#x27; is constructed by combining the root &#x27; &#x27;write&#x27; with the pattern &#x27; &#x27;I Xed&#x27; to form &quot; &#x27;I wrote&#x27;.

Other verbs meaning &#x27;I Xed&#x27; will typically have the same pattern but with different consonants, e.g. &#x27; &#x27;I read&#x27;, &#x27; &#x27;I ate&#x27;, &#x27; &#x27;I went&#x27;, although other patterns are possible, e.g. &#x27; &#x27;I drank&#x27;, &#x27; &#x27;I said&#x27;, &#x27; &#x27;I spoke&#x27;, where the subpattern used to signal the past tense may change but the suffix &quot; is always used.

From a single root , numerous words can be formed by applying different patterns:
* &quot; &#x27;I wrote&#x27;
* &quot; &#x27;I had (something) written&#x27;
* &quot; &#x27;I corresponded (with someone)&#x27;
* &quot; &#x27;I dictated&#x27;
* &quot; &#x27;I subscribed&#x27;
* &quot; &#x27;we corresponded with each other&#x27;
* &quot; &#x27;I write&#x27;
* &quot; &#x27;I have (something) written&#x27;
* &quot; &#x27;I correspond (with someone)&#x27;
* &quot; &#x27;I dictate&#x27;
* &quot; &#x27;I subscribe&#x27;
* &quot; &#x27;we correspond each other&#x27;
* &quot; &#x27;it was written&#x27;
* &quot; &#x27;it was dictated&#x27;
* &quot; &#x27;written&#x27;
* &quot; &#x27;dictated&#x27;
* &quot; &#x27;book&#x27;
* &quot; &#x27;books&#x27;
* &quot; &#x27;writer&#x27;
* &quot; &#x27;writers&#x27;
* &quot; &#x27;desk, office&#x27;
* &quot; &#x27;library, bookshop&#x27;
* etc.

====Nouns and adjectives====
Nouns in Literary Arabic have three grammatical cases (nominative, accusative, and genitive [also used when the noun is governed by a preposition]); three numbers (singular, dual and plural); two genders (masculine and feminine); and three &quot;states&quot; (indefinite, definite, and construct). The cases of singular nouns, other than those that end in long ā, are indicated by suffixed short vowels (/-u/ for nominative, /-a/ for accusative, /-i/ for genitive).

The feminine singular is often marked by /-at/, which is pronounced as /-ah/ before a pause. Plural is indicated either through endings (the sound plural) or internal modification (the broken plural). Definite nouns include all proper nouns, all nouns in &quot;construct state&quot; and all nouns which are prefixed by the definite article /al-/. Indefinite singular nouns, other than those that end in long ā, add a final /-n/ to the case-marking vowels, giving /-un/, /-an/ or /-in/, which is also referred to as nunation or tanwīn.

Adjectives in Literary Arabic are marked for case, number, gender and state, as for nouns. The plural of all non-human nouns is always combined with a singular feminine adjective, which takes the /-at/ suffix.

Pronouns in Literary Arabic are marked for person, number and gender. There are two varieties, independent pronouns and enclitics. Enclitic pronouns are attached to the end of a verb, noun or preposition and indicate verbal and prepositional objects or possession of nouns. The first-person singular pronoun has a different enclitic form used for verbs ( /-nī/) and for nouns or prepositions ( /-ī/ after consonants, /-ya/ after vowels).

Nouns, verbs, pronouns and adjectives agree with each other in all respects. Non-human plural nouns are grammatically considered to be feminine singular. A verb in a verb-initial sentence is marked as singular regardless of its semantic number when the subject of the verb is explicitly mentioned as a noun. Numerals between three and ten show &quot;chiasmic&quot; agreement, in that grammatically masculine numerals have feminine marking and vice versa.

====Verbs====

Verbs in Literary Arabic are marked for person (first, second, or third), gender, and number. They are conjugated in two major paradigms (past and non-past); two voices (active and passive); and six moods (indicative, imperative, subjunctive, jussive, shorter energetic and longer energetic); the fifth and sixth moods, the energetics, exist only in Classical Arabic but not in MSA. There are two participles, active and passive, and a verbal noun, but no infinitive.

The past and non-past paradigms are sometimes termed perfective and imperfective, indicating the fact that they actually represent a combination of tense and aspect. The moods other than the indicative occur only in the non-past, and the future tense is signaled by prefixing &#x27; or &#x27; onto the non-past. The past and non-past differ in the form of the stem (e.g., past &#x27; vs. non-past &#x27;), and use completely different sets of affixes for indicating person, number and gender: In the past, the person, number and gender are fused into a single suffixal morpheme, while in the non-past, a combination of prefixes (primarily encoding person) and suffixes (primarily encoding gender and number) are used. The passive voice uses the same person/number/gender affixes but changes the vowels of the stem.

The following shows a paradigm of a regular Arabic verb, &quot;&quot; &#x27;to write&#x27;. In Modern Standard, the energetic mood, in either long or short form, which has the same meaning, is almost never used.

====Derivation====
Like other Semitic languages, and unlike most other languages, Arabic makes much more use of nonconcatenative morphology, applying many templates applied to roots, to derive words than adding prefixes or suffixes to words.

For verbs, a given root can occur in many different derived verb stems, of which there are about fifteen, each with one or more characteristic meanings and each with its own templates for the past and non-past stems, active and passive participles, and verbal noun. These are referred to by Western scholars as &quot;Form I&quot;, &quot;Form II&quot;, and so on through &quot;Form XV&quot;, although Forms XI to XV are rare.

These stems encode grammatical functions such as the causative, intensive and reflexive. Stems sharing the same root consonants represent separate verbs, albeit often semantically related, and each is the basis for its own conjugational paradigm. As a result, these derived stems are part of the system of derivational morphology, not part of the inflectional system.

Examples of the different verbs formed from the root &#x27; &#x27;write&#x27; (using &#x27; &#x27;red&#x27; for Form IX, which is limited to colors and physical defects):
Form II is sometimes used to create transitive denominative verbs (verbs built from nouns); Form V is the equivalent used for intransitive denominatives.

The associated participles and verbal nouns of a verb are the primary means of forming new lexical nouns in Arabic. This is similar to the process by which, for example, the English gerund &quot;meeting&quot; (similar to a verbal noun) has turned into a noun referring to a particular type of social, often work-related event where people gather together to have a &quot;discussion&quot; (another lexicalized verbal noun). Another fairly common means of forming nouns is through one of a limited number of patterns that can be applied directly to roots, such as the &quot;nouns of location&quot; in &quot;ma-&quot; (e.g. &#x27; &#x27;desk, office&#x27; &lt; &#x27; &#x27;write&#x27;, &#x27; &#x27;kitchen&#x27; &lt; &#x27; &#x27;cook&#x27;).

The only three genuine suffixes are as follows:
* The feminine suffix &quot;-ah&quot;; variously derives terms for women from related terms for men, or more generally terms along the same lines as the corresponding masculine, e.g. &#x27; &#x27;library&#x27; (also a writing-related place, but different from &#x27;, as above).
* The nisbah suffix &quot;-iyy-&quot;. This suffix is extremely productive, and forms adjectives meaning &quot;related to X&quot;. It corresponds to English adjectives in &quot;-ic, -al, -an, -y, -ist&quot;, etc.
* The feminine nisbah suffix &quot;-iyyah&quot;. This is formed by adding the feminine suffix &quot;-ah&quot; onto nisba adjectives to form abstract nouns. For example, from the basic root &#x27; &#x27;share&#x27; can be derived the Form VIII verb &#x27; &#x27;to cooperate, participate&#x27;, and in turn its verbal noun &#x27; &#x27;cooperation, participation&#x27; can be formed. This in turn can be made into a nisbah adjective &#x27; &#x27;socialist&#x27;, from which an abstract noun &#x27; &#x27;socialism&#x27; can be derived. Other recent formations are &#x27; &#x27;republic&#x27; (lit. &quot;public-ness&quot;, &lt; &#x27; &#x27;multitude, general public&#x27;), and the Gaddafi-specific variation &#x27; &#x27;people&#x27;s republic&#x27; (lit. &quot;masses-ness&quot;, &lt; &#x27; &#x27;the masses&#x27;, pl. of &#x27;, as above).

=== Colloquial varieties ===

The spoken dialects have lost the case distinctions and make only limited use of the dual (it occurs only on nouns and its use is no longer required in all circumstances). They have lost the mood distinctions other than imperative, but many have since gained new moods through the use of prefixes (most often /bi-/ for indicative vs. unmarked subjunctive). They have also mostly lost the indefinite &quot;nunation&quot; and the internal passive.

The following is an example of a regular verb paradigm in Egyptian Arabic.

== Writing system ==
The Arabic alphabet derives from the Aramaic through Nabatean, to which it bears a loose resemblance like that of Coptic or Cyrillic scripts to Greek script. Traditionally, there were several differences between the Western (North African) and Middle Eastern versions of the alphabet—in particular, the &quot;faʼ&quot; had a dot underneath and &quot;qaf&quot; a single dot above in the Maghreb, and the order of the letters was slightly different (at least when they were used as numerals).

However, the old Maghrebi variant has been abandoned except for calligraphic purposes in the Maghreb itself, and remains in use mainly in the Quranic schools (zaouias) of West Africa. Arabic, like all other Semitic languages (except for the Latin-written Maltese, and the languages with the Ge&#x27;ez script), is written from right to left. There are several styles of scripts such as thuluth, muhaqqaq, tawqi, rayhan, and notably naskh, which is used in print and by computers, and ruqʻah, which is commonly used for correspondence.

Originally Arabic was made up of only &quot;rasm&quot; without diacritical marks Later diacritical points (which in Arabic are referred to as &quot;nuqaṯ&quot;) were added (which allowed readers to distinguish between letters such as b, t, th, n and y). Finally signs known as &quot;Tashkil&quot; were used for short vowels known as &quot;harakat&quot; and other uses such as final postnasalized or long vowels.

Notes:

* Modern Standard Arabic (Literary Arabic) can be pronounced or (or only in Egypt) depending on the speaker&#x27;s regional dialect.
* The Hamza can be considered a letter and plays an important role in Arabic spelling but it is not considered part of the alphabet, it has different written forms depending on its position in the word, check Hamza.

=== Calligraphy ===

After Khalil ibn Ahmad al Farahidi finally fixed the Arabic script around 786, many styles were developed, both for the writing down of the Quran and other books, and for inscriptions on monuments as decoration.

Arabic calligraphy has not fallen out of use as calligraphy has in the Western world, and is still considered by Arabs as a major art form; calligraphers are held in great esteem. Being cursive by nature, unlike the Latin script, Arabic script is used to write down a verse of the Quran, a hadith, or a proverb. The composition is often abstract, but sometimes the writing is shaped into an actual form such as that of an animal. One of the current masters of the genre is Hassan Massoudy.

In modern times the intrinsically calligraphic nature of the written Arabic form is haunted by the thought that a typographic approach to the language, necessary for digitized unification, will not always accurately maintain meanings conveyed through calligraphy.

=== Romanization ===
There are a number of different standards for the romanization of Arabic, i.e. methods of accurately and efficiently representing Arabic with the Latin script. There are various conflicting motivations involved, which leads to multiple systems. Some are interested in transliteration, i.e. representing the &quot;spelling&quot; of Arabic, while others focus on transcription, i.e. representing the &quot;pronunciation&quot; of Arabic. (They differ in that, for example, the same letter is used to represent both a consonant, as in &quot;you&quot; or &quot;yet&quot;, and a vowel, as in &quot;me&quot; or &quot;eat&quot;.)

Some systems, e.g. for scholarly use, are intended to accurately and unambiguously represent the phonemes of Arabic, generally making the phonetics more explicit than the original word in the Arabic script. These systems are heavily reliant on diacritical marks such as &quot;š&quot; for the sound equivalently written &quot;sh&quot; in English. Other systems (e.g. the Bahá&#x27;í orthography) are intended to help readers who are neither Arabic speakers nor linguists with intuitive pronunciation of Arabic names and phrases.

These less &quot;scientific&quot; systems tend to avoid diacritics and use digraphs (like &quot;sh&quot; and &quot;kh&quot;). These are usually simpler to read, but sacrifice the definiteness of the scientific systems, and may lead to ambiguities, e.g. whether to interpret &quot;sh&quot; as a single sound, as in &quot;gash&quot;, or a combination of two sounds, as in &quot;gashouse&quot;. The ALA-LC romanization solves this problem by separating the two sounds with a prime symbol ( ′ ); e.g., &quot;as′hal&quot; &#x27;easier&#x27;.

During the last few decades and especially since the 1990s, Western-invented text communication technologies have become prevalent in the Arab world, such as personal computers, the World Wide Web, email, bulletin board systems, IRC, instant messaging and mobile phone text messaging. Most of these technologies originally had the ability to communicate using the Latin script only, and some of them still do not have the Arabic script as an optional feature. As a result, Arabic speaking users communicated in these technologies by transliterating the Arabic text using the Latin script.

To handle those Arabic letters that cannot be accurately represented using the Latin script, numerals and other characters were appropriated. For example, the numeral &quot;3&quot; may be used to represent the Arabic letter . There is no universal name for this type of transliteration, but some have named it Arabic Chat Alphabet or IM Arabic. Other systems of transliteration exist, such as using dots or capitalization to represent the &quot;emphatic&quot; counterparts of certain consonants. For instance, using capitalization, the letter , may be represented by d. Its emphatic counterpart, , may be written as D.

=== Numerals ===
In most of present-day North Africa, the Western Arabic numerals (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) are used. However, in Egypt and Arabic-speaking countries to the east of it, the Eastern Arabic numerals ( – – – – – – – – – ) are in use. When representing a number in Arabic, the lowest-valued position is placed on the right, so the order of positions is the same as in left-to-right scripts. Sequences of digits such as telephone numbers are read from left to right, but numbers are spoken in the traditional Arabic fashion, with units and tens reversed from the modern English usage. For example, 24 is said &quot;four and twenty&quot; just like in the German language (&quot;vierundzwanzig&quot;) and Classical Hebrew, and 1975 is said &quot;a thousand and nine-hundred and five and seventy&quot; or, more eloquently, &quot;a thousand and nine-hundred five seventy&quot;.

=== Arabic alphabet and nationalism ===
There have been many instances of national movements to convert Arabic script into Latin script or to Romanize the language. Currently, the only Arabic variety to use Latin script is Maltese.

====Lebanon====
The Beirut newspaper &quot;La Syrie&quot; pushed for the change from Arabic script to Latin letters in 1922. The major head of this movement was Louis Massignon, a French Orientalist, who brought his concern before the Arabic Language Academy in Damascus in 1928. Massignon&#x27;s attempt at Romanization failed as the academy and population viewed the proposal as an attempt from the Western world to take over their country. Sa&#x27;id Afghani, a member of the academy, mentioned that the movement to Romanize the script was a Zionist plan to dominate Lebanon. Said Akl created a Latin-based alphabet for Lebanese and used it in a newspaper he founded, &quot;Lebnaan&quot;, as well as in some books he wrote.

====Egypt====
After the period of colonialism in Egypt, Egyptians were looking for a way to reclaim and re-emphasize Egyptian culture. As a result, some Egyptians pushed for an Egyptianization of the Arabic language in which the formal Arabic and the colloquial Arabic would be combined into one language and the Latin alphabet would be used. There was also the idea of finding a way to use Hieroglyphics instead of the Latin alphabet, but this was seen as too complicated to use.

A scholar, Salama Musa agreed with the idea of applying a Latin alphabet to Arabic, as he believed that would allow Egypt to have a closer relationship with the West. He also believed that Latin script was key to the success of Egypt as it would allow for more advances in science and technology. This change in alphabet, he believed, would solve the problems inherent with Arabic, such as a lack of written vowels and difficulties writing foreign words that made it difficult for non-native speakers to learn. Ahmad Lutfi As Sayid and Muhammad Azmi, two Egyptian intellectuals, agreed with Musa and supported the push for Romanization.

The idea that Romanization was necessary for modernization and growth in Egypt continued with Abd Al-Aziz Fahmi in 1944. He was the chairman for the Writing and Grammar Committee for the Arabic Language Academy of Cairo. This effort failed as the Egyptian people felt a strong cultural tie to the Arabic alphabet. In particular, the older Egyptian generations believed that the Arabic alphabet had strong connections to Arab values and history, due to the long history of the Arabic alphabet (Shrivtiel, 189) in Muslim societies.

<doc id="808" wikidata="Q7374" url="?curid=808" title="Alfred Hitchcock">
<text>Sir Alfred Joseph Hitchcock (13 August 1899 – 29 April 1980) was an English film director. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in the history of cinema. In a career spanning six decades, he directed over 50 feature films, many of which are still widely watched and studied today. Known as the &quot;Master of Suspense&quot;, Hitchcock became as well known as any of his actors thanks to his many interviews, his cameo appearances in most of his films, and his hosting and producing the television anthology &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; (1955–65). His films garnered 46 Academy Award nominations, including six wins, although he never won the award for Best Director, despite five nominations.

Hitchcock initially trained as a technical clerk and copywriter before entering the film industry in 1919 as a title card designer. His directorial debut was the British–German silent film &quot;The Pleasure Garden&quot; (1925). His first successful film, &quot;The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog&quot; (1927), helped to shape the thriller genre, and &quot;Blackmail&quot; (1929) was the first British &quot;talkie&quot;. His thrillers &quot;The 39 Steps&quot; (1935) and &quot;The Lady Vanishes&quot; (1938) are ranked among the greatest British films of the 20th century. By 1939, he had international recognition and producer David O. Selznick persuaded him to move to Hollywood. A string of successful films followed, including &quot;Rebecca&quot; (1940), &quot;Foreign Correspondent&quot; (1940), &quot;Suspicion&quot; (1941), &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot; (1943) and &quot;Notorious&quot; (1946). &quot;Rebecca&quot; won the Academy Award for Best Picture, with Hitchcock nominated as Best Director. He also received Oscar nominations for &quot;Lifeboat&quot; (1944), &quot;Spellbound&quot; (1945), &quot;Rear Window&quot; (1954) and &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960).

Hitchcock&#x27;s other notable films include &quot;Rope&quot; (1948), &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; (1951), &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; (1954), &quot;To Catch a Thief&quot; (1955), &quot;The Trouble with Harry&quot; (1955), &quot;Vertigo&quot; (1958), &quot;North by Northwest&quot; (1959), &quot;The Birds&quot; (1963) and &quot;Marnie&quot; (1964), all of which were also financially successful and are highly regarded by film historians. Hitchcock made a number of films with some of the biggest stars in Hollywood, including four with Cary Grant, four with James Stewart, three with Ingrid Bergman and three consecutively with Grace Kelly. Hitchcock became an American citizen in 1955.

In 2012, Hitchcock&#x27;s psychological thriller &quot;Vertigo&quot;, starring Stewart, displaced Orson Welles&#x27; &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (1941) as the British Film Institute&#x27;s greatest film ever made based on its world-wide poll of hundreds of film critics. , nine of his films had been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry, including his personal favourite, &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot; (1943). He received the BAFTA Fellowship in 1971, the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1979, and was knighted in December of that year, four months before his death on 29 April 1980.

==Biography==
===Early life: 1899–1919===
====Early childhood and education====

Alfred Joseph Hitchcock was born on 13 August 1899 in the flat above his parents&#x27; leased greengrocer&#x27;s shop at 517 High Road in Leytonstone, which was then part of Essex (now on the outskirts of East London). He was the son of greengrocer and poulterer, William Edgar Hitchcock (1862–1914) and Emma Jane (née Whelan; 1863–1942). The household was &quot;characterised by an atmosphere of discipline&quot;. He had an older brother named William John (1888–1943) and an older sister named Ellen Kathleen (1892–1979) who used the nickname &quot;Nellie&quot;. His parents were both Roman Catholics with English and Irish ancestry. His father was a greengrocer, as his grandfather had been. There was a large extended family, including uncle John Hitchcock with his five-bedroom Victorian house on Campion Road in Putney, complete with a maid, cook, chauffeur, and gardener. Every summer, his uncle rented a seaside house for the family in Cliftonville, Kent. Hitchcock said that he first became class-conscious there, noticing the differences between tourists and locals.

Describing himself as a well-behaved boy — his father called him his &quot;little lamb without a spot&quot; — Hitchcock said he could not remember ever having had a playmate. One of his favourite stories for interviewers was about his father sending him to the local police station with a note when he was five; the policeman looked at the note and locked him in a cell for a few minutes, saying, &quot;This is what we do to naughty boys.&quot; The experience left him with a lifelong phobia of law enforcement, and he told Tom Snyder in 1973 that he was &quot;scared stiff of anything ... to do with the law&quot; and that he would refuse to even drive a car in case he got a parking ticket. When he was six, the family moved to Limehouse and leased two stores at 130 and 175 Salmon Lane, which they ran as a fish-and-chip shop and fishmongers&#x27; respectively; they lived above the former. Hitchcock attended his first school, the Howrah House Convent in Poplar, which he entered in 1907, at age 7. According to biographer Patrick McGilligan, he stayed at Howrah House for at most two years. He also attended a convent school, the Wode Street School &quot;for the daughters of gentlemen and little boys&quot; run by the Faithful Companions of Jesus. He then attended a primary school near his home and was for a short time a boarder at Salesian College in Battersea.

The family moved again when Hitchcock was eleven, this time to Stepney, and on 5 October 1910 he was sent to St Ignatius College in Stamford Hill, a Jesuit grammar school with a reputation for discipline. As corporal punishment, the priests used a flat, hard, springy tool made of gutta-percha and known as a &quot;ferula&quot; which struck the whole palm; punishment was always at the end of the day, so the boys had to sit through classes anticipating the punishment if they had been written up for it. He later said that this is where he developed his sense of fear. The school register lists his year of birth as 1900 rather than 1899; biographer Donald Spoto says he was deliberately enrolled as a ten-year-old because he was a year behind with his schooling. While biographer Gene Adair reports that Hitchcock was &quot;an average, or slightly above-average, pupil&quot;, Hitchcock said that he was &quot;usually among the four or five at the top of the class&quot;; at the end of his first year, his work in Latin, English, French and religious education was noted. He told Peter Bogdanovich: &quot;The Jesuits taught me organisation, control and, to some degree, analysis.&quot;

Hitchcock&#x27;s favourite subject was geography and he became interested in maps and the timetables of trains, trams and buses; according to John Russell Taylor, he could recite all the stops on the &quot;Orient Express&quot;. He had a particular interest in London trams. An overwhelming majority of his films include rail or tram scenes, in particular &quot;The Lady Vanishes&quot;, &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; and &quot;Number Seventeen&quot;. A clapperboard shows the number of the scene and the number of takes, and Hitchcock would often take the two numbers on the clapperboard and whisper the London tram route names. For example, if the clapperboard showed &quot;Scene 23; Take 3&quot;, he would whisper &quot;Woodford, Hampstead&quot;Woodford being the terminus of the route 23 tram, and Hampstead the end of route 3.

====Henley&#x27;s====
Hitchcock told his parents that he wanted to be an engineer, and on 25 July 1913, he left St Ignatius and enrolled in night classes at the London County Council School of Engineering and Navigation in Poplar. In a book-length interview in 1962, he told François Truffaut that he had studied &quot;mechanics, electricity, acoustics, and navigation&quot;. Then, on 12 December 1914, his father, who had been suffering from emphysema and kidney disease, died at the age of 52. To support himself and his mother — his older siblings had left home by then — Hitchcock took a job, for 15 shillings a week (£ in ), as a technical clerk at the Henley Telegraph and Cable Company in Blomfield Street, near London Wall. He continued night classes, this time in art history, painting, economics and political science. His older brother ran the family shops, while he and his mother continued to live in Salmon Lane.

Hitchcock was too young to enlist when the First World War started in July 1914, and when he reached the required age of 18 in 1917, he received a C3 classification (&quot;free from serious organic disease, able to stand service conditions in garrisons at home ... only suitable for sedentary work&quot;). He joined a cadet regiment of the Royal Engineers and took part in theoretical briefings, weekend drills and exercises. John Russell Taylor wrote that, in one session of practical exercises in Hyde Park, Hitchcock was required to wear puttees. He could never master wrapping them around his legs, and they repeatedly fell down around his ankles.

After the war, Hitchcock took an interest in creative writing. In June 1919, he became a founding editor and business manager of Henley&#x27;s in-house publication, &quot;The Henley Telegraph&quot; (sixpence a copy), to which he submitted several short stories. Henley&#x27;s promoted him to the advertising department, where he wrote copy and drew graphics for electric cable advertisements. He enjoyed the job and would stay late at the office to examine the proofs; he told Truffaut that this was his &quot;first step toward cinema&quot;. He enjoyed watching films, especially American cinema, and from the age of 16 read the trade papers; he watched Charlie Chaplin, D. W. Griffith and Buster Keaton, and particularly liked Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;Der müde Tod&quot; (released in Britain in 1921 as &quot;Destiny&quot;).

===Inter-war career: 1919–1939===
====Famous Players–Lasky====

While still at Henley&#x27;s, he read in a trade paper that Famous Players–Lasky, the production arm of Paramount Pictures, was opening a studio in London. They were planning to film &quot;The Sorrows of Satan&quot; by Marie Corelli, so he produced some drawings for the title cards and sent his work to the studio. They hired him, and in 1919 he began working for Islington Studios in Poole Street, Hoxton, as a title-card designer.

Donald Spoto wrote that most of the staff were Americans with strict job specifications, but the English workers were encouraged to try their hand at anything, which meant that Hitchcock gained experience as a co-writer, art director and production manager on at least 18 silent films. &quot;The Times&quot; wrote in February 1922 about the studio&#x27;s &quot;special art title department under the supervision of Mr. A. J. Hitchcock&quot;. His work included &quot;Number 13&quot; (1922), also known as &quot;Mrs. Peabody;&quot; it was cancelled because of financial problems - the few finished scenes are lost — and &quot;Always Tell Your Wife&quot; (1923), which he and Seymour Hicks finished together when Hicks was about to give up on it. Hicks wrote later about being helped by &quot;a fat youth who was in charge of the property room ... [n]one other than Alfred Hitchcock&quot;.

====Gainsborough Pictures and work in Germany====

When Paramount pulled out of London in 1922, Hitchcock was hired as an assistant director by a new firm run in the same location by Michael Balcon, later known as Gainsborough Pictures. Hitchcock worked on &quot;Woman to Woman&quot; (1923) with the director Graham Cutts, designing the set, writing the script and producing. He said: &quot;It was the first film that I had really got my hands onto.&quot; The editor and &quot;script girl&quot; on &quot;Woman to Woman&quot; was Alma Reville, his future wife. He also worked as an assistant to Cutts on &quot;The White Shadow&quot; (1924), &quot;The Passionate Adventure&quot; (1924), &quot;The Blackguard&quot; (1925) and &quot;The Prude&#x27;s Fall&quot; (1925). &quot;The Blackguard&quot; was produced at the Babelsberg Studios in Potsdam, where Hitchcock watched part of the making of F. W. Murnau&#x27;s &quot;The Last Laugh&quot; (1924). He was impressed with Murnau&#x27;s work, and later used many of his techniques for the set design in his own productions.

In the summer of 1925, Balcon asked Hitchcock to direct &quot;The Pleasure Garden&quot; (1925), starring Virginia Valli, a co-production of Gainsborough and the German firm Emelka at the Geiselgasteig studio near Munich. Reville, by then Hitchcock&#x27;s fiancée, was assistant director-editor. Although the film was a commercial flop, Balcon liked Hitchcock&#x27;s work; a &quot;Daily Express&quot; headline called him the &quot;Young man with a master mind&quot;. In March 1926, the British film magazine &quot;Picturegoer&quot; ran an article entitled &quot;Alfred the Great&quot; by the film critic Cedric Belfrage, who praised Hitchcock for possessing &quot;such a complete grasp of all the different branches of film technique that he is able to take far more control of his production than the average director of four times his experience.&quot; Production of &quot;The Pleasure Garden&quot; encountered obstacles which Hitchcock would later learn from: on arrival to Brenner Pass, he failed to declare his film stock to customs and it was confiscated; one actress could not enter the water for a scene because she was on her period; budget overruns meant that he had to borrow money from the actors. Hitchcock also needed a translator to give instructions to the cast and crew.

In Germany, Hitchcock observed the nuances of German cinema and filmmaking which had a big influence on him. When he was not working, he would visit Berlin&#x27;s art galleries, concerts and museums. He would also meet with actors, writers and producers to build connections. Balcon asked him to direct a second film in Munich, &quot;The Mountain Eagle&quot; (1926), based on an original story titled &quot;Fear o&#x27; God&quot;. The film is lost, and Hitchcock called it &quot;a very bad movie&quot;. A year later, Hitchcock wrote and directed &quot;The Ring&quot;; although the screenplay was credited solely to his name, Elliot Stannard assisted him with the writing. &quot;The Ring&quot; garnered positive reviews; the &quot;Bioscope&quot; critic called it &quot;the most magnificent British film ever made&quot;.

When he returned to England, Hitchcock was one of the early members of the London Film Society, newly formed in 1925. Through the Society, he became fascinated by the work by Soviet filmmakers: Dziga Vertov, Lev Kuleshov, Sergei Eisenstein and Vsevolod Pudovkin. He would also socialise with fellow English filmmakers Ivor Montagu, Adrian Brunel and Walter Mycroft. Hitchcock recognised the value in cultivating his own brand, with the director aggressively promoting himself during this period. In a 1925 London Film Society meeting he declared directors were what mattered most in making films, with Donald Spoto writing that Hitchcock proclaimed, &quot;&quot;We&quot; make a film succeed. The name of the director should be associated in the public&#x27;s mind with a quality product. Actors come and go, but the name of the director should stay clearly in the mind of the audience.&quot; 
Hitchcock established himself as a name director with his first thriller, &quot;The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog&quot; (1927). The film concerns the hunt for a Jack the Ripper-style serial killer who, wearing a black cloak and carrying a black bag, is murdering young blonde women in London, and only on Tuesdays. A landlady suspects that her lodger is the killer, but he turns out to be innocent. Hitchcock had wanted the leading man to be guilty, or for the film at least to end ambiguously, but the star was Ivor Novello, a matinée idol, and the &quot;star system&quot; meant that Novello could not be the villain. Hitchcock told Truffaut: &quot;You have to clearly spell it out in big letters: &#x27;He is innocent.&#x27;&quot; (He had the same problem years later with Cary Grant in &quot;Suspicion&quot; (1941).) Released in January 1927, &quot;The Lodger&quot; was a commercial and critical success in the UK. Upon its release, the trade journal &quot;Bioscope&quot; wrote: &quot;It is possible that this film is the finest British production ever made&quot;. Hitchcock told Truffaut that the film was the first of his to be influenced by German Expressionism: &quot;In truth, you might almost say that &quot;The Lodger&quot; was my first picture.&quot; In a strategy for self-publicity, &quot;The Lodger&quot; saw him make his first cameo appearance in a film, where he sat in a newsroom. 

Continuing to market his brand following the success of &quot;The Lodger&quot;, Hitchcock wrote a letter to the &quot;London Evening News&quot; in November 1927 about his filmmaking, participated in studio-produced publicity, and by December 1927 he developed the original sketch of his widely recognised profile which he introduced by sending it to friends and colleagues as a Christmas present.

====Marriage====

On 2 December 1926, Hitchcock married the English screenwriter Alma Reville at the Brompton Oratory in South Kensington. The couple honeymooned in Paris, Lake Como and St. Moritz, before returning to London to live in a leased flat on the top two floors of 153 Cromwell Road, Kensington. Reville, who was born just hours after Hitchcock, converted from Protestantism to Catholicism, apparently at the insistence of Hitchcock&#x27;s mother; she was baptised on 31 May 1927 and confirmed at Westminster Cathedral by Cardinal Francis Bourne on 5 June.

In 1928, when they learned that Reville was pregnant, the Hitchcocks purchased &quot;Winter&#x27;s Grace&quot;, a Tudor farmhouse set in eleven acres on Stroud Lane, Shamley Green, Surrey, for £2,500. Their daughter and only child, Patricia (Pat) Alma Hitchcock, was born on 7 July that year. Pat died on 9 August 2021 at the age of 93.

Reville became her husband&#x27;s closest collaborator; Charles Champlin wrote in 1982: &quot;The Hitchcock touch had four hands, and two were Alma&#x27;s.&quot; When Hitchcock accepted the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1979, he said that he wanted to mention &quot;four people who have given me the most affection, appreciation and encouragement, and constant collaboration. The first of the four is a film editor, the second is a scriptwriter, the third is the mother of my daughter, Pat, and the fourth is as fine a cook as ever performed miracles in a domestic kitchen. And their names are Alma Reville.&quot; Reville wrote or co-wrote on many of Hitchcock&#x27;s films, including &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot;, &quot;Suspicion&quot; and &quot;The 39 Steps&quot;.

====Early sound films====
Hitchcock began work on his tenth film, &quot;Blackmail&quot; (1929), when its production company, British International Pictures (BIP), converted its Elstree studios to sound. The film was the first British &quot;talkie&quot;; this followed the rapid development of sound films in the United States, from the use of brief sound segments in &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; (1927) to the first full sound feature &quot;Lights of New York&quot; (1928). &quot;Blackmail&quot; began the Hitchcock tradition of using famous landmarks as a backdrop for suspense sequences, which includes an early example of a red telephone box being used for criminal activity, while the climax takes place on the dome of the British Museum. It also features one of his longest cameo appearances, which shows him being bothered by a small boy as he reads a book on the London Underground. In the PBS series &quot;The Men Who Made The Movies&quot;, Hitchcock explained how he used early sound recording as a special element of the film to create tension, with a gossipy woman (Phyllis Monkman) stressing the word &quot;knife&quot; in her conversation with the woman suspected of murder. During this period, Hitchcock directed segments for a BIP revue, &quot;Elstree Calling&quot; (1930), and directed a short film, &quot;An Elastic Affair&quot; (1930), featuring two &quot;Film Weekly&quot; scholarship winners. &quot;An Elastic Affair&quot; is one of the lost films.

In 1933, Hitchcock signed a multi-film contract with Gaumont-British, once again working for Michael Balcon. His first film for the company, &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot; (1934), was a success; his second, &quot;The 39 Steps&quot; (1935), was acclaimed in the UK, and gained him recognition in the US. It also established the quintessential English &quot;Hitchcock blonde&quot; (Madeleine Carroll) as the template for his succession of ice-cold, elegant leading ladies. Screenwriter Robert Towne remarked: &quot;It&#x27;s not much of an exaggeration to say that all contemporary escapist entertainment begins with &quot;The 39 Steps&quot;&quot;. John Buchan, author of &quot;The Thirty-Nine Steps&quot; on which the film is loosely based, met with Hitchcock on set, and attended the high-profile premiere at the New Gallery Cinema in London. Upon viewing the film, the author said it had improved on the book. This film was one of the first to introduce the &quot;MacGuffin&quot; plot device, a term coined by the English screenwriter and Hitchcock collaborator Angus MacPhail. The MacGuffin is an item or goal the protagonist is pursuing, one that otherwise has no narrative value; in &quot;The 39 Steps&quot;, the MacGuffin is a stolen set of design plans.

Hitchcock released two spy thrillers in 1936. &quot;Sabotage&quot; was loosely based on Joseph Conrad&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Secret Agent&quot; (1907), about a woman who discovers that her husband is a terrorist, and &quot;Secret Agent&quot;, based on two stories in &quot;&quot; (1928) by W. Somerset Maugham. In his positive review of &quot;Sabotage&quot; for &quot;The Spectator&quot;, the writer and journalist Graham Greene identified the children&#x27;s matinée scene as an &quot;ingenious and pathetic twist stamped as Mr Hitchcock&#x27;s own&quot;. &quot;Secret Agent&quot; starred Madeleine Carroll and John Gielgud, with Peter Lorre playing Gielgud&#x27;s deranged assistant, and typical Hitchcockian themes include mistaken identity, trains and a &quot;Hitchcock blonde&quot;.

At this time, Hitchcock also became notorious for pranks against the cast and crew. These jokes ranged from simple and innocent to crazy and maniacal. For instance, he hosted a dinner party where he dyed all the food blue because he claimed there weren&#x27;t enough blue foods. He also had a horse delivered to the dressing room of his friend, actor Gerald du Maurier.

Hitchcock followed up with &quot;Young and Innocent&quot; in 1937, a crime thriller based on the 1936 novel &quot;A Shilling for Candles&quot; by Josephine Tey. Starring Nova Pilbeam and Derrick De Marney, the film was relatively enjoyable for the cast and crew to make. To meet distribution purposes in America, the film&#x27;s runtime was cut and this included removal of one of Hitchcock&#x27;s favourite scenes: a children&#x27;s tea party which becomes menacing to the protagonists.

Hitchcock&#x27;s next major success was &quot;The Lady Vanishes&quot; (1938), &quot;one of the greatest train movies from the genre&#x27;s golden era&quot;, according to Philip French, in which Miss Froy (May Whitty), a British spy posing as a governess, disappears on a train journey through the fictional European country of Bandrika. The film saw Hitchcock receive the 1938 New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Director. Benjamin Crisler of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in June 1938: &quot;Three unique and valuable institutions the British have that we in America have not: Magna Carta, the Tower Bridge and Alfred Hitchcock, the greatest director of screen melodramas in the world.&quot; The film was based on the novel &quot;The Wheel Spins&quot; (1936) written by Ethel Lina White, and starred Michael Redgrave (in his film debut) and Margaret Lockwood.

By 1938, Hitchcock was aware that he had reached his peak in Britain. He had received numerous offers from producers in the United States, but he turned them all down because he disliked the contractual obligations or thought the projects were repellent. However, producer David O. Selznick offered him a concrete proposal to make a film based on the sinking of , which was eventually shelved, but Selznick persuaded Hitchcock to come to Hollywood. In June 1938, Hitchcock sailed to New York aboard the RMS &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, and found that he was already a celebrity; he was featured in magazines and gave interviews to radio stations. In Hollywood, Hitchcock met Selznick for the first time. Selznick offered him a four-film contract, approximately $40,000 for each picture (). Before finalising any American deal, Hitchcock had one last film to make in England, as director of the Charles Laughton-produced picture &quot;Jamaica Inn&quot; (1939), which he had signed on to make in May 1938, right before his first trip to the US.

===Early Hollywood years: 1939–1945===
====Selznick contract====
Selznick signed Hitchcock to a seven-year contract beginning in April 1939, and the Hitchcocks moved to Hollywood. The Hitchcocks lived in a spacious flat on Wilshire Boulevard, and slowly acclimatised themselves to the Los Angeles area. He and his wife Alma kept a low profile, and were not interested in attending parties or being celebrities. Hitchcock discovered his taste for fine food in West Hollywood, but still carried on his way of life from England. He was impressed with Hollywood&#x27;s filmmaking culture, expansive budgets and efficiency, compared to the limits that he had often faced in Britain. In June that year, &quot;Life&quot; called him the &quot;greatest master of melodrama in screen history&quot;.

Although Hitchcock and Selznick respected each other, their working arrangements were sometimes difficult. Selznick suffered from constant financial problems, and Hitchcock was often unhappy about Selznick&#x27;s creative control and interference over his films. Selznick was also displeased with Hitchcock&#x27;s method of shooting just what was in the script, and nothing more, which meant that the film could not be cut and remade differently at a later time. As well as complaining about Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;goddamn jigsaw cutting&quot;, their personalities were mismatched: Hitchcock was reserved whereas Selznick was flamboyant. Eventually, Selznick generously lent Hitchcock to the larger film studios. Selznick made only a few films each year, as did fellow independent producer Samuel Goldwyn, so he did not always have projects for Hitchcock to direct. Goldwyn had also negotiated with Hitchcock on a possible contract, only to be outbid by Selznick. In a later interview, Hitchcock said: &quot;[Selznick] was the Big Producer. ... Producer was king. The most flattering thing Mr. Selznick ever said about me—and it shows you the amount of control—he said I was the &#x27;only director&#x27; he&#x27;d &#x27;trust with a film&#x27;.&quot;

Hitchcock approached American cinema cautiously; his first American film was set in England in which the &quot;Americanness&quot; of the characters was incidental: &quot;Rebecca&quot; (1940) was set in a Hollywood version of England&#x27;s Cornwall and based on a novel by English novelist Daphne du Maurier. Selznick insisted on a faithful adaptation of the book, and disagreed with Hitchcock with the use of humour. The film, starring Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine, concerns an unnamed naïve young woman who marries a widowed aristocrat. She lives in his large English country house, and struggles with the lingering reputation of his elegant and worldly first wife Rebecca, who died under mysterious circumstances. The film won Best Picture at the 13th Academy Awards; the statuette was given to producer Selznick. Hitchcock received his first nomination for Best Director, his first of five such nominations.

Hitchcock&#x27;s second American film was the thriller &quot;Foreign Correspondent&quot; (1940), set in Europe, based on Vincent Sheean&#x27;s book &quot;Personal History&quot; (1935) and produced by Walter Wanger. It was nominated for Best Picture that year. Hitchcock felt uneasy living and working in Hollywood while Britain was at war; his concern resulted in a film that overtly supported the British war effort. Filmed in 1939, it was inspired by the rapidly changing events in Europe, as covered by an American newspaper reporter played by Joel McCrea. By mixing footage of European scenes with scenes filmed on a Hollywood backlot, the film avoided direct references to Nazism, Nazi Germany and Germans, to comply with the Motion Picture Production Code at the time.

====Early war years====
In September 1940, the Hitchcocks bought the Cornwall Ranch near Scotts Valley, California, in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Their primary residence was an English-style home in Bel Air, purchased in 1942. Hitchcock&#x27;s films were diverse during this period, ranging from the romantic comedy &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith&quot; (1941) to the bleak film noir &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot; (1943).
&quot;Suspicion&quot; (1941) marked Hitchcock&#x27;s first film as a producer and director. It is set in England; Hitchcock used the north coast of Santa Cruz for the English coastline sequence. The film is the first of four in which Cary Grant was cast by Hitchcock, and it is one of the rare occasions that Grant plays a sinister character. Grant plays Johnnie Aysgarth, an English conman whose actions raise suspicion and anxiety in his shy young English wife, Lina McLaidlaw (Joan Fontaine). In one scene, Hitchcock placed a light inside a glass of milk, perhaps poisoned, that Grant is bringing to his wife; the light ensures that the audience&#x27;s attention is on the glass. Grant&#x27;s character is actually a killer, according to the book, &quot;Before the Fact&quot; by Francis Iles, but the studio felt that Grant&#x27;s image would be tarnished by that. Hitchcock would have preferred to end with the wife&#x27;s murder. Instead, the actions that she found suspicious are a reflection of his own despair and his plan to commit suicide. Fontaine won Best Actress for her performance.

&quot;Saboteur&quot; (1942) is the first of two films that Hitchcock made for Universal Studios during the decade. Hitchcock wanted Gary Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck or Henry Fonda and Gene Tierney to star, but was forced by Universal to use Universal contract player Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane, a freelancer who signed a one-picture deal with the studio, both known for their work in comedies and light dramas. The story depicts a confrontation between a suspected saboteur (Cummings) and a real saboteur (Norman Lloyd) atop the Statue of Liberty. Hitchcock took a three-day tour of New York City to scout for &quot;Saboteur&quot;″s filming locations. He also directed &quot;Have You Heard?&quot; (1942), a photographic dramatisation for &quot;Life&quot; magazine of the dangers of rumours during wartime. In 1943, he wrote a mystery story for &quot;Look&quot;, &quot;The Murder of Monty Woolley&quot;, a sequence of captioned photographs inviting the reader to find clues to the murderer&#x27;s identity; Hitchcock cast the performers as themselves, such as Woolley, Doris Merrick and make-up man Guy Pearce.

Back in England, Hitchcock&#x27;s mother Emma was severely ill; she died on 26 September 1942 at age 79. Hitchcock never spoke publicly about his mother, but his assistant said that he admired her. Four months later, on 4 January 1943, his brother William died of an overdose at age 52. Hitchcock was not very close to William, but his death made Hitchcock conscious about his own eating and drinking habits. He was overweight and suffering from back aches. His New Year&#x27;s resolution in 1943 was to take his diet seriously with the help of a physician. In January that year, &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot; was released, which Hitchcock had fond memories of making. In the film, Charlotte &quot;Charlie&quot; Newton (Teresa Wright) suspects her beloved uncle Charlie Oakley (Joseph Cotten) of being a serial killer. Hitchcock filmed extensively on location, this time in the Northern California city of Santa Rosa.

At 20th Century Fox, Hitchcock approached John Steinbeck with an idea for a film, which recorded the experiences of the survivors of a German U-boat attack. Steinbeck began work on the script for what would become &quot;Lifeboat&quot; (1944). However, Steinbeck was unhappy with the film and asked that his name be removed from the credits, to no avail. The idea was rewritten as a short story by Harry Sylvester and published in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; in 1943. The action sequences were shot in a small boat in the studio water tank. The locale posed problems for Hitchcock&#x27;s traditional cameo appearance; it was solved by having Hitchcock&#x27;s image appear in a newspaper that William Bendix is reading in the boat, showing the director in a before-and-after advertisement for &quot;Reduco-Obesity Slayer&quot;. He told Truffaut in 1962:

Hitchcock&#x27;s typical dinner before his weight loss had been a roast chicken, boiled ham, potatoes, bread, vegetables, relishes, salad, dessert, a bottle of wine and some brandy. To lose weight, his diet consisted of black coffee for breakfast and lunch, and steak and salad for dinner, but it was hard to maintain; Donald Spoto wrote that his weight fluctuated considerably over the next 40 years. At the end of 1943, despite the weight loss, the Occidental Insurance Company of Los Angeles refused his application for life insurance.

====Wartime non-fiction films====
Hitchcock returned to the UK for an extended visit in late 1943 and early 1944. While there he made two short propaganda films, &quot;Bon Voyage&quot; (1944) and &quot;Aventure Malgache&quot; (1944), for the Ministry of Information. In June and July 1945, Hitchcock served as &quot;treatment advisor&quot; on a Holocaust documentary that used Allied Forces footage of the liberation of Nazi concentration camps. The film was assembled in London and produced by Sidney Bernstein of the Ministry of Information, who brought Hitchcock (a friend of his) on board. It was originally intended to be broadcast to the Germans, but the British government deemed it too traumatic to be shown to a shocked post-war population. Instead, it was transferred in 1952 from the British War Office film vaults to London&#x27;s Imperial War Museum and remained unreleased until 1985, when an edited version was broadcast as an episode of PBS &quot;Frontline&quot;, under the title the Imperial War Museum had given it: &quot;Memory of the Camps&quot;. The full-length version of the film, &quot;German Concentration Camps Factual Survey&quot;, was restored in 2014 by scholars at the Imperial War Museum.

===Post-war Hollywood years: 1945–1953===
====Later Selznick films====

Hitchcock worked for David Selznick again when he directed &quot;Spellbound&quot; (1945), which explores psychoanalysis and features a dream sequence designed by Salvador Dalí. The dream sequence as it appears in the film is ten minutes shorter than was originally envisioned; Selznick edited it to make it &quot;play&quot; more effectively. Gregory Peck plays amnesiac Dr. Anthony Edwardes under the treatment of analyst Dr. Peterson (Ingrid Bergman), who falls in love with him while trying to unlock his repressed past. Two point-of-view shots were achieved by building a large wooden hand (which would appear to belong to the character whose point of view the camera took) and out-sized props for it to hold: a bucket-sized glass of milk and a large wooden gun. For added novelty and impact, the climactic gunshot was hand-coloured red on some copies of the black-and-white film. The original musical score by Miklós Rózsa makes use of the theremin, and some of it was later adapted by the composer into Rozsa&#x27;s Piano Concerto Op. 31 (1967) for piano and orchestra.

The spy film &quot;Notorious&quot; followed next in 1946. Hitchcock told François Truffaut that Selznick sold him, Ingrid Bergman, Cary Grant and Ben Hecht&#x27;s screenplay, to RKO Radio Pictures as a &quot;package&quot; for $500,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) because of cost overruns on Selznick&#x27;s &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot; (1946). &quot;Notorious&quot; stars Bergman and Grant, both Hitchcock collaborators, and features a plot about Nazis, uranium and South America. His prescient use of uranium as a plot device led to him being briefly placed under surveillance by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. According to Patrick McGilligan, in or around March 1945, Hitchcock and Hecht consulted Robert Millikan of the California Institute of Technology about the development of a uranium bomb. Selznick complained that the notion was &quot;science fiction&quot;, only to be confronted by the news of the detonation of two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan in August 1945.

====Transatlantic Pictures====
Hitchcock formed an independent production company, Transatlantic Pictures, with his friend Sidney Bernstein. He made two films with Transatlantic, one of which was his first colour film. With &quot;Rope&quot; (1948), Hitchcock experimented with marshalling suspense in a confined environment, as he had done earlier with &quot;Lifeboat&quot;. The film appears as a very limited number of continuous shots, but it was actually shot in 10 ranging from to 10 minutes each; a 10-minute length of film was the most that a camera&#x27;s film magazine could hold at the time. Some transitions between reels were hidden by having a dark object fill the entire screen for a moment. Hitchcock used those points to hide the cut, and began the next take with the camera in the same place. The film features James Stewart in the leading role, and was the first of four films that Stewart made with Hitchcock. It was inspired by the Leopold and Loeb case of the 1920s. Critical response at the time was mixed.

&quot;Under Capricorn&quot; (1949), set in 19th-century Australia, also uses the short-lived technique of long takes, but to a more limited extent. He again used Technicolor in this production, then returned to black-and-white for several years. Transatlantic Pictures became inactive after the last two films. Hitchcock filmed &quot;Stage Fright&quot; (1950) at Elstree Studios in England, where he had worked during his British International Pictures contract many years before. He paired one of Warner Bros.&#x27; most popular stars, Jane Wyman, with the expatriate German actor Marlene Dietrich and used several prominent British actors, including Michael Wilding, Richard Todd and Alastair Sim. This was Hitchcock&#x27;s first proper production for Warner Bros., which had distributed &quot;Rope&quot; and &quot;Under Capricorn&quot;, because Transatlantic Pictures was experiencing financial difficulties.

His thriller &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; (1951) was based on the novel of the same name by Patricia Highsmith. Hitchcock combined many elements from his preceding films. He approached Dashiell Hammett to write the dialogue, but Raymond Chandler took over, then left over disagreements with the director. In the film, two men casually meet, one of whom speculates on a foolproof method to murder; he suggests that two people, each wishing to do away with someone, should each perform the other&#x27;s murder. Farley Granger&#x27;s role was as the innocent victim of the scheme, while Robert Walker, previously known for &quot;boy-next-door&quot; roles, played the villain. &quot;I Confess&quot; (1953) was set in Quebec with Montgomery Clift as a Catholic priest.

===Peak years: 1954–1964===
====&quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; and &quot;Rear Window&quot;====

&quot;I Confess&quot; was followed by three colour films starring Grace Kelly: &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; (1954), &quot;Rear Window&quot; (1954) and &quot;To Catch a Thief&quot; (1955). In &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot;, Ray Milland plays the villain who tries to murder his unfaithful wife (Kelly) for her money. She kills the hired assassin in self-defence, so Milland manipulates the evidence to make it look like murder. Her lover, Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings), and Police Inspector Hubbard (John Williams) save her from execution. Hitchcock experimented with 3D cinematography for &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot;.

Hitchcock moved to Paramount Pictures and filmed &quot;Rear Window&quot; (1954), starring James Stewart and Grace Kelly, as well as Thelma Ritter and Raymond Burr. Stewart&#x27;s character is a photographer named Jeff (based on Robert Capa) who must temporarily use a wheelchair. Out of boredom, he begins observing his neighbours across the courtyard, then becomes convinced that one of them (Raymond Burr) has murdered his wife. Jeff eventually manages to convince his policeman buddy (Wendell Corey) and his girlfriend (Kelly). As with &quot;Lifeboat&quot; and &quot;Rope&quot;, the principal characters are depicted in confined or cramped quarters, in this case Stewart&#x27;s studio apartment. Hitchcock uses close-ups of Stewart&#x27;s face to show his character&#x27;s reactions, &quot;from the comic voyeurism directed at his neighbours to his helpless terror watching Kelly and Burr in the villain&#x27;s apartment&quot;.

====&quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;====
From 1955 to 1965, Hitchcock was the host of the television series &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;. With his droll delivery, gallows humour and iconic image, the series made Hitchcock a celebrity. The title-sequence of the show pictured a minimalist caricature of his profile (he drew it himself; it is composed of only nine strokes), which his real silhouette then filled. The series theme tune was &quot;Funeral March of a Marionette&quot; by the French composer Charles Gounod (1818–1893).

His introductions always included some sort of wry humour, such as the description of a recent multi-person execution hampered by having only one electric chair, while two are shown with a sign &quot;Two chairs—no waiting!&quot; He directed 18 episodes of the series, which aired from 1955 to 1965. It became &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot; in 1962, and NBC broadcast the final episode on 10 May 1965. In the 1980s, a new version of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; was produced for television, making use of Hitchcock&#x27;s original introductions in a colourised form.

Hitchcock&#x27;s success in television spawned a set of short-story collections in his name; these included &quot;Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s Anthology&quot;, &quot;Stories They Wouldn&#x27;t Let Me Do on TV,&quot; and &quot;Tales My Mother Never Told Me&quot;. In 1956, HSD Publications also licensed the director&#x27;s name to create &quot;Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot;, a monthly digest specialising in crime and detective fiction. Hitchcock&#x27;s television series were very profitable, and his foreign-language versions of books were bringing revenues of up to $100,000 a year ().

====From &quot;To Catch a Thief&quot; to &quot;Vertigo&quot;====
In 1955, Hitchcock became a United States citizen. In the same year, his third Grace Kelly film, &quot;To Catch a Thief&quot;, was released; it is set in the French Riviera, and stars Kelly and Cary Grant. Grant plays retired thief John Robie, who becomes the prime suspect for a spate of robberies in the Riviera. A thrill-seeking American heiress played by Kelly surmises his true identity and tries to seduce him. &quot;Despite the obvious age disparity between Grant and Kelly and a lightweight plot, the witty script (loaded with double entendres) and the good-natured acting proved a commercial success.&quot; It was Hitchcock&#x27;s last film with Kelly; she married Prince Rainier of Monaco in 1956, and ended her film career afterward. Hitchcock then remade his own 1934 film &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot; in 1956. This time, the film starred James Stewart and Doris Day, who sang the theme song &quot;Que Sera, Sera&quot;, which won the Academy Award for Best Original Song and became a big hit. They play a couple whose son is kidnapped to prevent them from interfering with an assassination. As in the 1934 film, the climax takes place at the Royal Albert Hall.

&quot;The Wrong Man&quot; (1956), Hitchcock&#x27;s final film for Warner Bros., is a low-key black-and-white production based on a real-life case of mistaken identity reported in &quot;Life&quot; magazine in 1953. This was the only film of Hitchcock to star Henry Fonda, playing a Stork Club musician mistaken for a liquor store thief, who is arrested and tried for robbery while his wife (Vera Miles) emotionally collapses under the strain. Hitchcock told Truffaut that his lifelong fear of the police attracted him to the subject and was embedded in many scenes.

While directing episodes for &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; during the summer of 1957, Hitchcock was admitted to hospital for hernia and gallstones, and had to have his gallbladder removed. Following a successful surgery, he immediately returned to work to prepare for his next project. &quot;Vertigo&quot; (1958) again starred James Stewart, with Kim Novak and Barbara Bel Geddes. He had wanted Vera Miles to play the lead, but she was pregnant. He told Oriana Fallaci: &quot;I was offering her a big part, the chance to become a beautiful sophisticated blonde, a real actress. We&#x27;d have spent a heap of dollars on it, and she has the bad taste to get pregnant. I hate pregnant women, because then they have children.&quot;

In &quot;Vertigo&quot;, Stewart plays Scottie, a former police investigator suffering from acrophobia, who becomes obsessed with a woman he has been hired to shadow (Novak). Scottie&#x27;s obsession leads to tragedy, and this time Hitchcock did not opt for a happy ending. Some critics, including Donald Spoto and Roger Ebert, agree that &quot;Vertigo&quot; is the director&#x27;s most personal and revealing film, dealing with the &quot;Pygmalion&quot;-like obsessions of a man who moulds a woman into the person he desires. &quot;Vertigo&quot; explores more frankly and at greater length his interest in the relation between sex and death, than any other work in his filmography.

&quot;Vertigo&quot; contains a camera technique developed by Irmin Roberts, commonly referred to as a dolly zoom, which has been copied by many filmmakers. The film premiered at the San Sebastián International Film Festival, and Hitchcock won the Silver Seashell prize. &quot;Vertigo&quot; is considered a classic, but it attracted mixed reviews and poor box-office receipts at the time; the critic from &quot;Variety&quot; opined that the film was &quot;too slow and too long&quot;. Bosley Crowther of the &quot;New York Times&quot; thought it was &quot;devilishly far-fetched&quot;, but praised the cast performances and Hitchcock&#x27;s direction. The picture was also the last collaboration between Stewart and Hitchcock. In the 2002 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; polls, it ranked just behind &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (1941); ten years later, in the same magazine, critics chose it as the best film ever made.

====&quot;North by Northwest&quot; and &quot;Psycho&quot;====

After &quot;Vertigo&quot;, the rest of 1958 was a difficult year for Hitchcock. During pre-production of &quot;North by Northwest&quot; (1959), which was a &quot;slow&quot; and &quot;agonising&quot; process, his wife Alma was diagnosed with cancer. While she was in hospital, Hitchcock kept himself occupied with his television work and would visit her every day. Alma underwent surgery and made a full recovery, but it caused Hitchcock to imagine, for the first time, life without her.
Hitchcock followed up with three more successful films, which are also recognised as among his best: &quot;North by Northwest&quot;, &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960) and &quot;The Birds&quot; (1963). In &quot;North by Northwest&quot;, Cary Grant portrays Roger Thornhill, a Madison Avenue advertising executive who is mistaken for a government secret agent. He is pursued across the United States by enemy agents, including Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint). At first, Thornhill believes Kendall is helping him, but then realises that she is an enemy agent; he later learns that she is working undercover for the CIA. During its opening two-week run at Radio City Music Hall, the film grossed $404,056 (equivalent to $ million in ), setting a non-holiday gross record for that theatre. &quot;Time&quot; magazine called the film &quot;smoothly troweled and thoroughly entertaining&quot;.

&quot;Psycho&quot; (1960) is arguably Hitchcock&#x27;s best-known film. Based on Robert Bloch&#x27;s 1959 novel &quot;Psycho&quot;, which was inspired by the case of Ed Gein, the film was produced on a tight budget of $800,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) and shot in black-and-white on a spare set using crew members from &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;. The unprecedented violence of the shower scene, the early death of the heroine, and the innocent lives extinguished by a disturbed murderer became the hallmarks of a new horror-film genre. The film proved popular with audiences, with lines stretching outside theatres as viewers waited for the next showing. It broke box-office records in the United Kingdom, France, South America, the United States and Canada, and was a moderate success in Australia for a brief period.

&quot;Psycho&quot; was the most profitable of Hitchcock&#x27;s career, and he personally earned in excess of $15 million (equivalent to $ million in ). He subsequently swapped his rights to &quot;Psycho&quot; and his TV anthology for 150,000 shares of MCA, making him the third largest shareholder and his own boss at Universal, in theory at least, although that did not stop studio interference. Following the first film, &quot;Psycho&quot; became an American horror franchise: &quot;Psycho II&quot;, &quot;Psycho III&quot;, &quot;Bates Motel&quot;, &quot;Psycho IV: The Beginning&quot; and a colour 1998 remake of the original.

====Truffaut interview====

On 13 August 1962, Hitchcock&#x27;s 63rd birthday, the French director François Truffaut began a 50-hour interview of Hitchcock, filmed over eight days at Universal Studios, during which Hitchcock agreed to answer 500 questions. It took four years to transcribe the tapes and organise the images; it was published as a book in 1967, which Truffaut nicknamed the &quot;Hitchbook&quot;. The audio tapes were used as the basis of a documentary in 2015. Truffaut sought the interview because it was clear to him that Hitchcock was not simply the mass-market entertainer the American media made him out to be. It was obvious from his films, Truffaut wrote, that Hitchcock had &quot;given more thought to the potential of his art than any of his colleagues&quot;. He compared the interview to &quot;Oedipus&#x27; consultation of the oracle&quot;.

====&quot;The Birds&quot;====
The film scholar Peter William Evans wrote that &quot;The Birds&quot; (1963) and &quot;Marnie&quot; (1964) are regarded as &quot;undisputed masterpieces&quot;. Hitchcock had intended to film &quot;Marnie&quot; first, and in March 1962 it was announced that Grace Kelly, Princess Grace of Monaco since 1956, would come out of retirement to star in it. When Kelly asked Hitchcock to postpone &quot;Marnie&quot; until 1963 or 1964, he recruited Evan Hunter, author of &quot;The Blackboard Jungle&quot; (1954), to develop a screenplay based on a Daphne du Maurier short story, &quot;The Birds&quot; (1952), which Hitchcock had republished in his &quot;My Favorites in Suspense&quot; (1959). He hired Tippi Hedren to play the lead role. It was her first role; she had been a model in New York when Hitchcock saw her, in October 1961, in an NBC television advert for Sego, a diet drink: &quot;I signed her because she is a classic beauty. Movies don&#x27;t have them any more. Grace Kelly was the last.&quot; He insisted, without explanation, that her first name be written in single quotation marks: &#x27;Tippi&#x27;.

In &quot;The Birds&quot;, Melanie Daniels, a young socialite, meets lawyer Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) in a bird shop; Jessica Tandy plays his possessive mother. Hedren visits him in Bodega Bay (where &quot;The Birds&quot; was filmed) carrying a pair of lovebirds as a gift. Suddenly waves of birds start gathering, watching, and attacking. The question: &quot;What do the birds want?&quot; is left unanswered. Hitchcock made the film with equipment from the Revue Studio, which made &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;. He said it was his most technically challenging film, using a combination of trained and mechanical birds against a backdrop of wild ones. Every shot was sketched in advance.

An HBO/BBC television film, &quot;The Girl&quot; (2012), depicted Hedren&#x27;s experiences on set; she said that Hitchcock became obsessed with her and sexually harassed her. He reportedly isolated her from the rest of the crew, had her followed, whispered obscenities to her, had her handwriting analysed and had a ramp built from his private office directly into her trailer. Diane Baker, her co-star in &quot;Marnie&quot;, said: &quot;[N]othing could have been more horrible for me than to arrive on that movie set and to see her being treated the way she was.&quot; While filming the attack scene in the attic — which took a week to film — she was placed in a caged room while two men wearing elbow-length protective gloves threw live birds at her. Toward the end of the week, to stop the birds&#x27; flying away from her too soon, one leg of each bird was attached by nylon thread to elastic bands sewn inside her clothes. She broke down after a bird cut her lower eyelid, and filming was halted on doctor&#x27;s orders.

====&quot;Marnie&quot;====
In June 1962, Grace Kelly announced that she had decided against appearing in &quot;Marnie&quot; (1964). Hedren had signed an exclusive seven-year, $500-a-week contract with Hitchcock in October 1961, and he decided to cast her in the lead role opposite Sean Connery. In 2016, describing Hedren&#x27;s performance as &quot;one of the greatest in the history of cinema&quot;, Richard Brody called the film a &quot;story of sexual violence&quot; inflicted on the character played by Hedren: &quot;The film is, to put it simply, sick, and it&#x27;s so because Hitchcock was sick. He suffered all his life from furious sexual desire, suffered from the lack of its gratification, suffered from the inability to transform fantasy into reality, and then went ahead and did so virtually, by way of his art.&quot; A 1964 &quot;New York Times&quot; review called it Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;most disappointing film in years&quot;, citing Hedren&#x27;s and Connery&#x27;s lack of experience, an amateurish script and &quot;glaringly fake cardboard backdrops&quot;.

In the film, Marnie Edgar (Hedren) steals $10,000 from her employer and goes on the run. She applies for a job at Mark Rutland&#x27;s (Connery) company in Philadelphia and steals from there too. Earlier, she is shown having a panic attack during a thunderstorm and fearing the colour red. Mark tracks her down and blackmails her into marrying him. She explains that she does not want to be touched, but during the &quot;honeymoon&quot;, Mark rapes her. Marnie and Mark discover that Marnie&#x27;s mother had been a prostitute when Marnie was a child, and that, while the mother was fighting with a client during a thunderstorm — the mother believed the client had tried to molest Marnie — Marnie had killed the client to save her mother. Cured of her fears when she remembers what happened, she decides to stay with Mark.

Hitchcock told cinematographer Robert Burks that the camera had to be placed as close as possible to Hedren when he filmed her face. Evan Hunter, the screenwriter of &quot;The Birds&quot; who was writing &quot;Marnie&quot; too, explained to Hitchcock that, if Mark loved Marnie, he would comfort her, not rape her. Hitchcock reportedly replied: &quot;Evan, when he sticks it in her, I want that camera right on her face!&quot; When Hunter submitted two versions of the script, one without the rape scene, Hitchcock replaced him with Jay Presson Allen.

===Later years: 1966–1980===
====Final films====
Failing health reduced Hitchcock&#x27;s output during the last two decades of his life. Biographer Stephen Rebello claimed Universal imposed two films on him, &quot;Torn Curtain&quot; (1966) and &quot;Topaz&quot; (1969), the latter of which is based on a Leon Uris novel, partly set in Cuba. Both were spy thrillers with Cold War-related themes. &quot;Torn Curtain&quot;, with Paul Newman and Julie Andrews, precipitated the bitter end of the twelve-year collaboration between Hitchcock and composer Bernard Herrmann. Hitchcock was unhappy with Herrmann&#x27;s score and replaced him with John Addison, Jay Livingston and Ray Evans. Upon release, &quot;Torn Curtain&quot; was a box office disappointment, and &quot;Topaz&quot; was disliked by both critics and the studio.

Hitchcock returned to Britain to make his penultimate film, &quot;Frenzy&quot; (1972), based on the novel &quot;Goodbye Piccadilly, Farewell Leicester Square&quot; (1966). After two espionage films, the plot marked a return to the murder-thriller genre. Richard Blaney (Jon Finch), a volatile barman with a history of explosive anger, becomes the prime suspect in the investigation into the &quot;Necktie Murders&quot;, which are actually committed by his friend Bob Rusk (Barry Foster). This time, Hitchcock makes the victim and villain kindreds, rather than opposites, as in &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot;.

In &quot;Frenzy&quot;, Hitchcock allowed nudity for the first time. Two scenes show naked women, one of whom is being raped and strangled; Donald Spoto called the latter &quot;one of the most repellent examples of a detailed murder in the history of film&quot;. Both actors, Barbara Leigh-Hunt and Anna Massey, refused to do the scenes, so models were used instead. Biographers have noted that Hitchcock had always pushed the limits of film censorship, often managing to fool Joseph Breen, the head of the Motion Picture Production Code. Hitchcock would add subtle hints of improprieties forbidden by censorship until the mid-1960s. Yet, Patrick McGilligan wrote that Breen and others often realised that Hitchcock was inserting such material and were actually amused, as well as alarmed by Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;inescapable inferences&quot;.

&quot;Family Plot&quot; (1976) was Hitchcock&#x27;s last film. It relates the escapades of &quot;Madam&quot; Blanche Tyler, played by Barbara Harris, a fraudulent spiritualist, and her taxi-driver lover Bruce Dern, making a living from her phony powers. While &quot;Family Plot&quot; was based on the Victor Canning novel &quot;The Rainbird Pattern&quot; (1972), the novel&#x27;s tone is more sinister. Screenwriter Ernest Lehman originally wrote the film, under the working title &quot;Deception&quot;, with a dark tone but was pushed to a lighter, more comical tone by Hitchcock where it took the name &quot;Deceit&quot;, then finally, &quot;Family Plot&quot;.

====Knighthood and death====
 Toward the end of his life, Hitchcock was working on the script for a spy thriller, &quot;The Short Night&quot;, collaborating with James Costigan, Ernest Lehman and David Freeman. Despite preliminary work, it was never filmed. Hitchcock&#x27;s health was declining and he was worried about his wife, who had suffered a stroke. The screenplay was eventually published in Freeman&#x27;s book &quot;The Last Days of Alfred Hitchcock&quot; (1999).

Having refused a CBE in 1962, Hitchcock was appointed a Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1980 New Year Honours. He was too ill to travel to London—he had a pacemaker and was being given cortisone injections for his arthritis—so on 3 January 1980 the British consul general presented him with the papers at Universal Studios. Asked by a reporter after the ceremony why it had taken the Queen so long, Hitchcock quipped, &quot;I suppose it was a matter of carelessness.&quot; Cary Grant, Janet Leigh and others attended a luncheon afterwards.

His last public appearance was on 16 March 1980, when he introduced the next year&#x27;s winner of the American Film Institute award. He died of kidney failure the following month, on 29 April, in his Bel Air home. Donald Spoto, one of Hitchcock&#x27;s biographers, wrote that Hitchcock had declined to see a priest, but according to Jesuit priest Mark Henninger, he and another priest, Tom Sullivan, celebrated Mass at the filmmaker&#x27;s home, and Sullivan heard his confession. Hitchcock was survived by his wife and daughter. His funeral was held at Good Shepherd Catholic Church in Beverly Hills on 30 April, after which his body was cremated. His remains were scattered over the Pacific Ocean on 10 May 1980.

==Filmmaking==
===Style and themes===

The &quot;Hitchcockian&quot; style includes the use of editing and camera movement to mimic a person&#x27;s gaze, thereby turning viewers into voyeurs, and framing shots to maximise anxiety and fear. The film critic Robin Wood wrote that the meaning of a Hitchcock film &quot;is there in the method, in the progression from shot to shot. A Hitchcock film is an organism, with the whole implied in every detail and every detail related to the whole.&quot;

Hitchcock&#x27;s film production career evolved from small-scale silent films to financially significant sound films. Hitchcock remarked that he was influenced by early filmmakers George Méliès, D. W. Griffith and Alice Guy-Blaché. His silent films between 1925 and 1929 were in the crime and suspense genres, but also included melodramas and comedies. Whilst visual storytelling was pertinent during the silent era, even after the arrival of sound, Hitchcock still relied on visuals in cinema; he referred to this emphasis on visual storytelling as &quot;pure cinema&quot;. In Britain, he honed his craft so that by the time he moved to Hollywood, the director had perfected his style and camera techniques. Hitchcock later said that his British work was the &quot;sensation of cinema&quot;, whereas the American phase was when his &quot;ideas were fertilised&quot;. Scholar Robin Wood writes that the director&#x27;s first two films, &quot;The Pleasure Garden&quot; and &quot;The Mountain Eagle&quot;, were influenced by German Expressionism. Afterward, he discovered Soviet cinema, and Sergei Eisenstein&#x27;s and Vsevolod Pudovkin&#x27;s theories of montage. 1926&#x27;s &quot;The Lodger&quot; was inspired by both German and Soviet aesthetics, styles which solidified the rest of his career. Although Hitchcock&#x27;s work in the 1920s found some success, several British reviewers criticised Hitchcock&#x27;s films for being unoriginal and conceited. Raymond Durgnat opined that Hitchcock&#x27;s films were carefully and intelligently constructed, but thought they can be shallow and rarely present a &quot;coherent worldview&quot;.

Earning the title &quot;Master of Suspense&quot;, the director experimented with ways to generate tension in his work. He said, &quot;My suspense work comes out of creating nightmares for the audience. And I &quot;play&quot; with an audience. I make them gasp and surprise them and shock them. When you have a nightmare, it&#x27;s awfully vivid if you&#x27;re dreaming that you&#x27;re being led to the electric chair. Then you&#x27;re as happy as can be when you wake up because you&#x27;re relieved.&quot; During filming of &quot;North by Northwest&quot;, Hitchcock explained his reasons for recreating the set of Mount Rushmore: &quot;The audience responds in proportion to how realistic you make it. One of the dramatic reasons for this type of photography is to get it looking so natural that the audience gets involved and believes, for the time being, what&#x27;s going on up there on the screen.&quot; In a 1963 interview with Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci, Hitchcock was asked how in spite of appearing to be a pleasant, innocuous man, he seemed to enjoy making films involving suspense and terrifying crime. He responded:

Hitchcock&#x27;s films, from the silent to the sound era, contained a number of recurring themes that he is famous for. His films explored audience as a voyeur, notably in &quot;Rear Window&quot;, &quot;Marnie&quot; and &quot;Psycho&quot;. He understood that human beings enjoy voyeuristic activities and made the audience participate in it through the character&#x27;s actions. Of his fifty-three films, eleven revolved around stories of mistaken identity, where an innocent protagonist is accused of a crime and is pursued by police. In most cases, it is an ordinary, everyday person who finds themselves in a dangerous situation. Hitchcock told Truffaut: &quot;That&#x27;s because the theme of the innocent man being accused, I feel, provides the audience with a greater sense of danger. It&#x27;s easier for them to identify with him than with a guilty man on the run.&quot; One of his constant themes was the struggle of a personality torn between &quot;order and chaos&quot;; known as the notion of &quot;double&quot;, which is a comparison or contrast between two characters or objects: the double representing a dark or evil side.

According to Robin Wood, Hitchcock retained a feeling of ambivalence towards homosexuality, despite working with gay actors throughout his career. Donald Spoto suggests that Hitchcock&#x27;s sexually repressive childhood may have contributed to his exploration of deviancy. During the 1950s, the Motion Picture Production Code prohibited direct references to homosexuality but the director was known for his subtle references, and pushing the boundaries of the censors. Moreover, &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot; has a double incest theme through the storyline, expressed implicitly through images. Author Jane Sloan argues that Hitchcock was drawn to both conventional and unconventional sexual expression in his work, and the theme of marriage was usually presented in a &quot;bleak and skeptical&quot; manner. It was also not until after his mother&#x27;s death in 1942, that Hitchcock portrayed motherly figures as &quot;notorious monster-mothers&quot;. The espionage backdrop, and murders committed by characters with psychopathic tendencies were common themes too. In Hitchcock&#x27;s depiction of villains and murderers, they were usually charming and friendly, forcing viewers to identify with them. The director&#x27;s strict childhood and Jesuit education may have led to his distrust of authority figures such as policemen and politicians; a theme which he has explored. Also, he used the &quot;MacGuffin&quot;—the use of an object, person or event to keep the plot moving along even if it was non-essential to the story.

Hitchcock appears briefly in most of his own films. For example, he is seen struggling to get a double bass onto a train (&quot;Strangers on a Train&quot;), walking dogs out of a pet shop (&quot;The Birds&quot;), fixing a neighbour&#x27;s clock (&quot;Rear Window&quot;), as a shadow (&quot;Family Plot&quot;), sitting at a table in a photograph (&quot;Dial M for Murder&quot;), and riding a bus (&quot;North by Northwest&quot;,&quot; To Catch a Thief&quot;).

===Representation of women===
Hitchcock&#x27;s portrayal of women has been the subject of much scholarly debate. Bidisha wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2010: &quot;There&#x27;s the vamp, the tramp, the snitch, the witch, the slink, the double-crosser and, best of all, the demon mommy. Don&#x27;t worry, they all get punished in the end.&quot; In a widely cited essay in 1975, Laura Mulvey introduced the idea of the male gaze; the view of the spectator in Hitchcock&#x27;s films, she argued, is that of the heterosexual male protagonist. &quot;The female characters in his films reflected the same qualities over and over again&quot;, Roger Ebert wrote in 1996: &quot;They were blonde. They were icy and remote. They were imprisoned in costumes that subtly combined fashion with fetishism. They mesmerised the men, who often had physical or psychological handicaps. Sooner or later, every Hitchcock woman was humiliated.&quot;

Hitchcock&#x27;s films often feature characters struggling in their relationships with their mothers, such as Norman Bates in &quot;Psycho&quot;. In &quot;North by Northwest&quot;, Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is an innocent man ridiculed by his mother for insisting that shadowy, murderous men are after him. In &quot;The Birds&quot;, the Rod Taylor character, an innocent man, finds his world under attack by vicious birds, and struggles to free himself from a clinging mother (Jessica Tandy). The killer in &quot;Frenzy&quot; has a loathing of women but idolises his mother. The villain Bruno in &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; hates his father, but has an incredibly close relationship with his mother (played by Marion Lorne). Sebastian (Claude Rains) in &quot;Notorious&quot; has a clearly conflicting relationship with his mother, who is (rightly) suspicious of his new bride, Alicia Huberman (Ingrid Bergman).

===Relationship with actors===
Hitchcock became known for having remarked that &quot;actors should be treated like cattle&quot;. During the filming of &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith&quot; (1941), Carole Lombard brought three cows onto the set wearing the name tags of Lombard, Robert Montgomery, and Gene Raymond, the stars of the film, to surprise him. In an episode of &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot;, originally broadcast on 8 June 1972, Dick Cavett stated as fact that Hitchcock had once called actors cattle. Hitchcock responded by saying that, at one time, he had been accused of calling actors cattle. &quot;I said that I would never say such an unfeeling, rude thing about actors at all. What I probably said, was that all actors should be treated like cattle...In a nice way of course.&quot; He then described Carole Lombard&#x27;s joke, with a smile.

Hitchcock believed that actors should concentrate on their performances and leave work on script and character to the directors and screenwriters. He told Bryan Forbes in 1967: &quot;I remember discussing with a method actor how he was taught and so forth. He said, &#x27;We&#x27;re taught using improvisation. We are given an idea and then we are turned loose to develop in any way we want to.&#x27; I said, &#x27;That&#x27;s not acting. That&#x27;s writing.&#x27;&quot;

Recalling their experiences on &quot;Lifeboat&quot; for Charles Chandler, author of &quot;It&#x27;s Only a Movie: Alfred Hitchcock A Personal Biography,&quot; Walter Slezak said that Hitchcock &quot;knew more about how to help an actor than any director I ever worked with&quot;, and Hume Cronyn dismissed the idea that Hitchcock was not concerned with his actors as &quot;utterly fallacious&quot;, describing at length the process of rehearsing and filming &quot;Lifeboat&quot;.

Critics observed that, despite his reputation as a man who disliked actors, actors who worked with him often gave brilliant performances. He used the same actors in many of his films; Cary Grant and James Stewart both worked with Hitchcock four times, and Ingrid Bergman and Grace Kelly three. James Mason said that Hitchcock regarded actors as &quot;animated props&quot;. For Hitchcock, the actors were part of the film&#x27;s setting. He told François Truffaut: &quot;The chief requisite for an actor is the ability to do nothing well, which is by no means as easy as it sounds. He should be willing to be used and wholly integrated into the picture by the director and the camera. He must allow the camera to determine the proper emphasis and the most effective dramatic highlights.&quot;

===Writing, storyboards and production===
Hitchcock planned his scripts in detail with his writers. In &quot;Writing with Hitchcock&quot; (2001), Steven DeRosa noted that Hitchcock supervised them through every draft, asking that they tell the story visually. Hitchcock told Roger Ebert in 1969:

Hitchcock&#x27;s films were extensively storyboarded to the finest detail. He was reported to have never even bothered looking through the viewfinder, since he did not need to, although in publicity photos he was shown doing so. He also used this as an excuse to never have to change his films from his initial vision. If a studio asked him to change a film, he would claim that it was already shot in a single way, and that there were no alternative takes to consider.
This view of Hitchcock as a director who relied more on pre-production than on the actual production itself has been challenged by Bill Krohn, the American correspondent of French film magazine &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot;, in his book &quot;Hitchcock at Work&quot;. After investigating script revisions, notes to other production personnel written by or to Hitchcock, and other production material, Krohn observed that Hitchcock&#x27;s work often deviated from how the screenplay was written or how the film was originally envisioned. He noted that the myth of storyboards in relation to Hitchcock, often regurgitated by generations of commentators on his films, was to a great degree perpetuated by Hitchcock himself or the publicity arm of the studios. For example, the celebrated crop-spraying sequence of &quot;North by Northwest&quot; was not storyboarded at all. After the scene was filmed, the publicity department asked Hitchcock to make storyboards to promote the film, and Hitchcock in turn hired an artist to match the scenes in detail.

Even when storyboards were made, scenes that were shot differed from them significantly. Krohn&#x27;s analysis of the production of Hitchcock classics like &quot;Notorious&quot; reveals that Hitchcock was flexible enough to change a film&#x27;s conception during its production. Another example Krohn notes is the American remake of &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much,&quot; whose shooting schedule commenced without a finished script and moreover went over schedule, something that, as Krohn notes, was not an uncommon occurrence on many of Hitchcock&#x27;s films, including &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; and &quot;Topaz&quot;. While Hitchcock did do a great deal of preparation for all his films, he was fully cognisant that the actual film-making process often deviated from the best-laid plans and was flexible to adapt to the changes and needs of production as his films were not free from the normal hassles faced and common routines used during many other film productions.
Krohn&#x27;s work also sheds light on Hitchcock&#x27;s practice of generally shooting in chronological order, which he notes sent many films over budget and over schedule and, more importantly, differed from the standard operating procedure of Hollywood in the Studio System Era. Equally important is Hitchcock&#x27;s tendency to shoot alternative takes of scenes. This differed from coverage in that the films were not necessarily shot from varying angles so as to give the editor options to shape the film how they chose (often under the producer&#x27;s aegis). Rather they represented Hitchcock&#x27;s tendency to give himself options in the editing room, where he would provide advice to his editors after viewing a rough cut of the work.

According to Krohn, this and a great deal of other information revealed through his research of Hitchcock&#x27;s personal papers, script revisions and the like refute the notion of Hitchcock as a director who was always in control of his films, whose vision of his films did not change during production, which Krohn notes has remained the central long-standing myth of Alfred Hitchcock. Both his fastidiousness and attention to detail also found their way into each film poster for his films. Hitchcock preferred to work with the best talent of his day—film poster designers such as Bill Gold and Saul Bass—who would produce posters that accurately represented his films.

===Awards and honours===
Hitchcock was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame on 8 February 1960 with two stars: one for television and a second for motion pictures. In 1978, John Russell Taylor described him as &quot;the most universally recognizable person in the world&quot; and &quot;a straightforward middle-class Englishman who just happened to be an artistic genius&quot;. In 2002, &quot;MovieMaker&quot; named him the most influential director of all time, and a 2007 &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; critics&#x27; poll ranked him Britain&#x27;s greatest director. David Gritten, the newspaper&#x27;s film critic, wrote: &quot;Unquestionably the greatest filmmaker to emerge from these islands, Hitchcock did more than any director to shape modern cinema, which would be utterly different without him. His flair was for narrative, cruelly withholding crucial information (from his characters and from us) and engaging the emotions of the audience like no one else.&quot; In 1992, the &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; Critics&#x27; Poll ranked Hitchcock at No. 4 in its list of &quot;Top 10 Directors&quot; of all time. In 2002, Hitchcock was ranked second in the critics&#x27; top ten poll and fifth in the directors&#x27; top ten poll in the list of &quot;The Greatest Directors of All Time&quot; compiled by &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot;. Hitchcock was voted the &quot;Greatest Director of 20th Century&quot; in a poll conducted by Japanese film magazine &quot;kinema Junpo&quot;. In 1996, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked Hitchcock at No. 1 in its &quot;50 Greatest Directors&quot; list. Hitchcock was ranked at No. 2 on &quot;Empire&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Top 40 Greatest Directors of All-Time&quot; list in 2005. In 2007, &quot;Total Film&quot; ranked Hitchcock at No. 1 on its &quot;100 Greatest Film Directors Ever&quot; list.
He won two Golden Globes, eight Laurel Awards, and five lifetime achievement awards, including the first BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award in 1971, and, in 1979, an AFI Life Achievement Award. He was nominated five times for an Academy Award for Best Director. &quot;Rebecca&quot;, nominated for eleven Oscars, won the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1940; another Hitchcock film, &quot;Foreign Correspondent&quot;, was also nominated that year. By 2021, nine of his films had been selected for preservation by the US National Film Registry: &quot;Rebecca&quot; (1940; inducted 2018), &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot; (1943; inducted 1991), &quot;Notorious&quot; (1946; inducted 2006), &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; (1951; inducted 2021), &quot;Rear Window&quot; (1954; inducted 1997), &quot;Vertigo&quot; (1958; inducted 1989), &quot;North by Northwest&quot; (1959; inducted 1995), &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960; inducted 1992) and &quot;The Birds&quot; (1963; inducted 2016).

In 2001, a series of 17 mosaics of Hitchcock&#x27;s life and work, which are located in Leytonstone tube station in the London Underground, was commissioned by the London Borough of Waltham Forest. In 2012, Hitchcock was selected by artist Sir Peter Blake, author of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; album cover, to appear in a new version of the cover, along with other British cultural figures, and he was featured that year in a BBC Radio 4 series, &quot;The New Elizabethans&quot;, as someone &quot;whose actions during the reign of Elizabeth II have had a significant impact on lives in these islands and given the age its character&quot;. In June 2013 nine restored versions of Hitchcock&#x27;s early silent films, including &quot;The Pleasure Garden&quot; (1925), were shown at the Brooklyn Academy of Music&#x27;s Harvey Theatre; known as &quot;The Hitchcock 9&quot;, the travelling tribute was organised by the British Film Institute.

===Archives===
The Alfred Hitchcock Collection is housed at the Academy Film Archive in Hollywood, California. It includes home movies, 16mm film shot on the set of &quot;Blackmail&quot; (1929) and &quot;Frenzy&quot; (1972), and the earliest known colour footage of Hitchcock. The Academy Film Archive has preserved many of his home movies. In 1984, Pat Hitchcock donated her father&#x27;s papers to the academy&#x27;s Margaret Herrick Library. The David O. Selznick and the Ernest Lehman collections housed at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center in Austin, Texas, contain material related to Hitchcock&#x27;s work on the production of &quot;The Paradine Case&quot;, &quot;Rebecca&quot;, &quot;Spellbound&quot;, &quot;North by Northwest&quot; and &quot;Family Plot.&quot;

<text>Anacondas or water boas are a group of large boas of the genus Eunectes. They are a semiaquatic group of snakes found in tropical South America. Three to five extant and one extinct species are currently recognized, including one of the largest snakes in the world, &quot;E. murinus&quot;, the green anaconda.

==Description==
Although the name applies to a group of snakes, it is often used to refer only to one species, in particular, the common or green anaconda (&quot;Eunectes murinus&quot;), which is the largest snake in the world by weight, and the second longest after the reticulated python.

==Origin==
The recent fossil record of &quot;Eunectes&quot; is relatively sparse compared to other vertebrates and other genera of snakes. The fossil record of this group is effected by an artifact called the Pull of the Recent. Fossils of recent ancestors are not known, so the living species &#x27;pull&#x27; the historical range of the genus to the present.

==Etymology==

The name &quot;Eunectes&quot; is derived from .

The South American names &quot;anacauchoa&quot; and &quot;anacaona&quot; were suggested in an account by Peter Martyr d&#x27;Anghiera. The idea of a South American origin was questioned by Henry Walter Bates who, in his travels in South America, failed to find any similar name in use. The word anaconda is derived from the name of a snake from Ceylon (Sri Lanka) that John Ray described in Latin in his &#x27; (1693) as &#x27;. 

Ray used a catalogue of snakes from the Leyden museum supplied by Dr. Tancred Robinson. The description of its habit was based on Andreas Cleyer, who in 1684 described a gigantic snake that crushed large animals by coiling around their bodies and crushing their bones. Henry Yule in his 1886 work &quot;Hobson-Jobson&quot;, notes that the word became more popular due to a piece of fiction published in 1768 in the Scots Magazine by a certain R. Edwin. Edwin described a &#x27;tiger&#x27; being crushed to death by an anaconda, when there were never any tigers in Sri Lanka. 

Yule and Frank Wall noted that the snake was a python and suggested a Tamil origin &#x27; meaning elephant killer. A Sinhalese origin was also suggested by Donald Ferguson who pointed out that the word &#x27; (&#x27; lightning/large and &#x27; stem/trunk) was used in Sri Lanka for the small whip snake (&quot;Ahaetulla pulverulenta&quot;) and somehow got misapplied to the python before myths were created.

The name commonly used for the anaconda in Brazil is &quot;sucuri&quot;, &quot;sucuriju&quot; or &quot;sucuriuba&quot;.
==Distribution and habitat==
Found in tropical South America from Ecuador, Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela south to Argentina.

==Feeding==
All five species are aquatic snakes that prey on other aquatic animals, including fish, river fowl, and caiman. Videos exist of anacondas preying on domestic animals such as goats and sometimes even young jaguars that venture too close to the water.

==Relationship with humans==
While encounters between people and anacondas may be dangerous, they do not regularly hunt humans. Nevertheless, threat from anacondas is a familiar trope in comics, movies, and adventure stories (often published in pulp magazines or adventure magazines) set in the Amazon jungle. Local communities and some European explorers have given accounts of giant anacondas, legendary snakes of much greater proportion than any confirmed specimen.

Although charismatic, there is little known on the biology of wild anacondas. Most of our knowledge comes from the work of Dr. Jesús A. Rivas and his team working in the Venezuelan Llanos.

==Species==
Rivas &quot;et al&quot;. revised the taxonomy of &quot;Eunectes&quot;, describing a new species of green anaconda (&quot;Eunectes akayima&quot;) and merging &quot;E. deschauenseei&quot; and &quot;E. beniensis&quot; with &quot;E. notaeus&quot;, which resulted in the recognition of only three species of anaconda. The result of their phylogenetic analysis is represented below:

In a response paper, Dubois &quot;et al&quot;. questioned the results of the mtDNA analysis above and the validity of &quot;Eunectes akayima&quot;. The name of the new species was considered a &quot;nomen nudum&quot;.

==Mating system==
The mating seasons in &quot;Eunectes&quot; varies both between species and within species depending on locality, although the trend appears to be the dry season. The green anaconda &quot;(E. murinus)&quot; is the most well-studied species of &quot;Eunectes&quot; in terms of their mating system, followed by the yellow anaconda &quot;(E. notaeus)&quot;; unfortunately &quot;E. deschauenseei&quot; and &quot;E. beniensis&quot; are much less common, making the specific details of their mating systems less well understood.

===Sexual dimorphism===
Sexual size dimorphism in &quot;Eunectes&quot; is the opposite of most other vertebrates. Females are larger than males in most snakes, and green anacondas &quot;(E. murinus)&quot; have one of the most extreme size differences, where females average roughly and males average only around . This size difference has several benefits for both sexes. Large size in females leads to higher fecundity and larger offspring; as a result male mate choice favours larger females. Large size is also favoured in males because larger males tend to be more successful at reproducing, both because of their size advantage in endurance rivalry and their advantage in sperm competition because larger males are able to produce more sperm. One reason that males are so much smaller in &quot;Eunectes&quot; is that large males can be confused for females, which interferes with their ability to mate when smaller males mistakenly coil them in breeding balls; as a result, there is an optimum size for males where they are large enough to successfully compete, but not large enough to risk other males trying to mate with them.

===Breeding balls===
During the mating season female anacondas release pheromones to attract males for breeding, which can result in polyandrous breeding balls; these breeding balls have been observed in &quot;E. murinus&quot;, &quot;E. notaeus&quot;, and &quot;E. deschauenseei&quot;, and likely also occur in &quot;E. beniensis&quot;. In the green anaconda &quot;(E. murinus)&quot;, up to 13 males have been observed in a breeding ball, which have been recorded to last two weeks on average. In anaconda breeding balls, several males coil around one female and attempt to position themselves as close to her cloaca as possible where they use their pelvic spurs to &quot;tickle&quot; and encourage her to allow penetration. Since there are often many males present and only one male can mate with the female at a time, the success of a male often depends on his persistence and endurance, because physical combat is not a part of the &quot;Eunectes&quot; mating ritual, apart from firmly pushing against other males in an attempt to secure the best position on the female.

===Sexual cannibalism===

Cannibalism is quite easy in anacondas since females are so much larger than males, but sexual cannibalism has only been confirmed in &quot;E. murinus&quot;. Females gain the direct benefit of a post-copulatory high-protein meal when they consume their mates, along with the indirect benefit of additional resources to use for the formation of offspring; cannibalism in general (outside of the breeding season) has been confirmed in all but &quot;E. deschauenseei&quot;, although it is likely that it occurs in all &quot;Eunectes&quot; species.

===Asexual reproduction===
Although sexual reproduction is by far the most common in &quot;Eunectes&quot;, &quot;E. murinus&quot; has been observed to undergo facultative parthenogenesis. In both cases, the females had lived in isolation from other anacondas for over eight years, and DNA analysis showed that the few fully formed offspring were genetically identical to the mothers; although this is not commonly observed, it is likely possible in all species of &quot;Eunectes&quot; and several other species of Boidae.

==Indigenous mythology==

According to the founding myth of the Huni Kuin, a man named Yube fell in love with an anaconda woman and was turned into an anaconda as well. He began to live with her in the deep world of waters. In this world, Yube discovered a hallucinogenic drink with healing powers and access to knowledge. One day, without telling his anaconda wife, Yube decided to return to the land of men and resume his old human form. The myth also explains the origin of cipó or ayahuasca — a hallucinogenic drink taken ritualistically by the Huni Kuin.

<doc id="824" wikidata="Q37845" url="?curid=824" title="Altaic languages">
<text>The Altaic () languages are a group of languages comprising the Turkic, Mongolic and Tungusic language families, with some linguists including the Koreanic and Japonic families. These languages share agglutinative morphology, head-final word order and some vocabulary. The once-popular theory attributing these similarities to a common ancestry has long been rejected by most comparative linguists in favor of language contact, although it continues to be supported by a small but stable scholarly minority. Like the Uralic language family, which is named after the Ural Mountains, the group is named after the Altai mountain range in the center of Asia. The core grouping of Turkic, Mongolic and Tungusic is sometimes called &quot;Micro-Altaic&quot;, with the expanded group including Koreanic and Japonic labelled as &quot;Macro-Altaic&quot; or &quot;Transeurasian&quot;.

The Altaic family was first proposed in the 18th century. It was widely accepted until the 1960s and is still listed in many encyclopedias and handbooks, and references to Altaic as a language family continue to percolate to modern sources through these older sources. Since the 1950s, most comparative linguists have rejected the proposal, after supposed cognates were found not to be valid, hypothesized sound shifts were not found, and Turkic and Mongolic languages were found to have been converging rather than diverging over the centuries. The relationship between the Altaic languages is now generally accepted to be the result of a sprachbund rather than common ancestry, with the languages showing influence from prolonged contact. 

Altaic has maintained a limited degree of scholarly support, in contrast to some other early macrofamily proposals. Continued research on Altaic is still being undertaken by a core group of academic linguists, but their research has not found wider support. In particular it has support from the Institute of Linguistics of the Russian Academy of Sciences and remains influential as a substratum of Turanism, where a hypothetical common linguistic ancestor has been used in part as a basis for a multiethnic nationalist movement.

==Earliest attestations==
The earliest attested expressions in Proto-Turkic are recorded in various Chinese sources. Anna Dybo identifies in Shizi (330 BCE) and the Book of Han (111 CE) several dozen Proto-Turkic exotisms in Chinese Han transcriptions. Lanhai Wei and Hui Li reconstruct the name of the Xiōngnú ruling house as
PT *Alayundluğ /alajuntˈluγ/ &#x27;piebald horse clan.&#x27;

The earliest known texts in a Turkic language are the Orkhon inscriptions, 720–735 AD. They were deciphered in 1893 by the Danish linguist Vilhelm Thomsen in a scholarly race with his rival, the German–Russian linguist Wilhelm Radloff. However, Radloff was the first to publish the inscriptions.

The first Tungusic language to be attested is Jurchen, the language of the ancestors of the Manchus. A writing system for it was devised in 1119 AD and an inscription using this system is known from 1185 (see List of Jurchen inscriptions).

The earliest Mongolic language of which we have written evidence is known as Middle Mongol. It is first attested by an inscription dated to 1224 or 1225 AD, the Stele of Yisüngge, and by the &quot;Secret History of the Mongols&quot;, written in 1228 (see Mongolic languages). The earliest Para-Mongolic text is the Memorial for Yelü Yanning, written in the Khitan large script and dated to 986 AD. However, the Inscription of Hüis Tolgoi, discovered in 1975 and analysed as being in an early form of Mongolic, has been dated to 604–620 AD. The Bugut inscription dates back to 584 AD.

Japanese is first attested in the form of names contained in a few short inscriptions in Classical Chinese from the 5th century AD, such as found on the Inariyama Sword. The first substantial text in Japanese, however, is the &quot;Kojiki&quot;, which dates from 712 AD. It is followed by the &quot;Nihon shoki&quot;, completed in 720, and then by the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot;, which dates from 771–785, but includes material that is from about 400 years earlier.

The most important text for the study of early Korean is the Hyangga, a collection of 25 poems, of which some go back to the Three Kingdoms period (57 BC–668 AD), but are preserved in an orthography that only goes back to the 9th century AD. Korean is copiously attested from the mid-15th century on in the phonetically precise Hangul system of writing.

==History of the Altaic family concept==
===Origins===
The earliest known reference to a unified language group of Turkic, Mongolic and Tungusic languages is from the 1692 work of Nicolaes Witsen which may be based on a 1661 work of Abu al-Ghazi Bahadur, &quot;Genealogy of the Turkmens&quot;.

A proposed grouping of the Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic languages was published in 1730 by Philip Johan von Strahlenberg, a Swedish officer who traveled in the eastern Russian Empire while a prisoner of war after the Great Northern War. However, he may not have intended to imply a closer relationship among those languages. Later proposals to include the Korean and Japanese languages into a &quot;Macro-Altaic&quot; family have always been controversial. The original proposal was sometimes called &quot;Micro-Altaic&quot; by retronymy. Most proponents of Altaic continue to support the inclusion of Korean, but fewer do for Japanese. Some proposals also included Ainuic but this is not widely accepted even among Altaicists themselves. A common ancestral Proto-Altaic language for the &quot;Macro&quot; family has been tentatively reconstructed by Sergei Starostin and others.

Micro-Altaic includes about 66 living languages, to which Macro-Altaic would add Korean, Jeju, Japanese, and the Ryukyuan languages, for a total of about 74 (depending on what is considered a language and what is considered a dialect). These numbers do not include earlier states of languages, such as Middle Mongol, Old Korean, or Old Japanese.

===Uralo-Altaic hypothesis===

In 1844, the Finnish philologist Matthias Castrén proposed a broader grouping which later came to be called the Ural–Altaic family, which included Turkic, Mongolian, and Manchu-Tungus (=Tungusic) as an &quot;Altaic&quot; branch, and also the Finno-Ugric and Samoyedic languages as the &quot;Uralic&quot; branch (though Castrén himself used the terms &quot;Tataric&quot; and &quot;Chudic&quot;). The name &quot;Altaic&quot; referred to the Altai Mountains in East-Central Asia, which are approximately the center of the geographic range of the three main families. The name &quot;Uralic&quot; referred to the Ural Mountains.

While the Ural-Altaic family hypothesis can still be found in some encyclopedias, atlases, and similar general references, since the 1960s it has been heavily criticized. Even linguists who accept the basic Altaic family, such as Sergei Starostin, completely discard the inclusion of the &quot;Uralic&quot; branch.

The term continues to be used for the central Eurasian typological, grammatical and lexical convergence zone. Indeed, &quot;Ural-Altaic&quot; may be preferable to &quot;Altaic&quot; in this sense. For example, Juha Janhunen states that &quot;speaking of &#x27;Altaic&#x27; instead of &#x27;Ural-Altaic&#x27; is a misconception, for there are no areal or typological features that are specific to &#x27;Altaic&#x27; without Uralic.&quot;

===Korean and Japanese languages===
In 1857, the Austrian scholar Anton Boller suggested adding Japanese to the Ural–Altaic family.

In the 1920s, G.J. Ramstedt and E.D. Polivanov advocated the inclusion of Korean. Decades later, in his 1952 book, Ramstedt rejected the Ural–Altaic hypothesis but again included Korean in Altaic, an inclusion followed by most leading Altaicists (supporters of the theory) to date. His book contained the first comprehensive attempt to identify regular correspondences among the sound systems within the Altaic language families.

In 1960, Nicholas Poppe published what was in effect a heavily revised version of Ramstedt&#x27;s volume on phonology that has since set the standard in Altaic studies. Poppe considered the issue of the relationship of Korean to Turkic-Mongolic-Tungusic not settled. In his view, there were three possibilities: (1) Korean did not belong with the other three genealogically, but had been influenced by an Altaic substratum; (2) Korean was related to the other three at the same level they were related to each other; (3) Korean had split off from the other three before they underwent a series of characteristic changes.

Roy Andrew Miller&#x27;s 1971 book &quot;Japanese and the Other Altaic Languages&quot; convinced most Altaicists that Japanese also belonged to Altaic. Since then, the &quot;Macro-Altaic&quot; has been generally assumed to include Turkic, Mongolic, Tungusic, Korean, and Japanese.

In 1990, Unger, emphasizing the need to establish language relationships rigorously &quot;from the bottom up,&quot; advocated comparing Tungusic with the common ancestor of Korean and Japanese before seeking connections with Turkic or Mongolic.

However, many linguists dispute the alleged affinities of Korean and Japanese to the other three groups. Some authors instead tried to connect Japanese to the Austronesian languages.

In 2017, Martine Robbeets proposed that Japanese (and possibly Korean) originated as a hybrid language. She proposed that the ancestral home of the Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic languages was somewhere in northwestern Manchuria. A group of those proto-Altaic (&quot;Transeurasian&quot;) speakers would have migrated south into the modern Liaoning province, where they would have been mostly assimilated by an agricultural community with an Austronesian-like language. The fusion of the two languages would have resulted in proto-Japanese and proto-Korean.

In a typological study that does not directly evaluate the validity of the Altaic hypothesis, Yurayong and Szeto (2020) discuss for Koreanic and Japonic the stages of convergence to the Altaic typological model and subsequent divergence from that model, which resulted in the present typological similarity between Koreanic and Japonic. They state that both are &quot;still so different from the Core Altaic languages that we can even speak of an independent Japanese-Korean type of grammar. Given also that there is neither a strong proof of common Proto-Altaic lexical items nor solid regular sound correspondences but, rather, only lexical and structural borrowings between languages of the Altaic typology, our results indirectly speak in favour of a “Paleo-Asiatic” origin of the Japonic and Koreanic languages.&quot;

===The Ainu language===
In 1962, John C. Street proposed an alternative classification, with Turkic-Mongolic-Tungusic in one grouping and Korean-Japanese-Ainu in another, joined in what he designated as the &quot;North Asiatic&quot; family. The inclusion of Ainu was adopted also by James Patrie in 1982.

The Turkic-Mongolic-Tungusic and Korean-Japanese-Ainu groupings were also posited in 2000–2002 by Joseph Greenberg. However, he treated them as independent members of a larger family, which he termed Eurasiatic.

The inclusion of Ainu is not widely accepted by Altaicists. In fact, no convincing genealogical relationship between Ainu and any other language family has been demonstrated, and it is generally regarded as a language isolate.

===Early criticism and rejection===
Starting in the late 1950s, some linguists became increasingly critical of even the minimal Altaic family hypothesis, disputing the alleged evidence of genetic connection between Turkic, Mongolic and Tungusic languages.

Among the earlier critics were Gerard Clauson (1956), Gerhard Doerfer (1963), and Alexander Shcherbak. They claimed that the words and features shared by Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic languages were for the most part borrowings and that the rest could be attributed to chance resemblances. In 1988, Doerfer again rejected all the genetic claims over these major groups.

===Modern controversy===
A major continuing supporter of the Altaic hypothesis has been Sergei Starostin, who published a comparative lexical analysis of the Altaic languages in 1991. He concluded that the analysis supported the Altaic grouping, although it was &quot;older than most other language families in Eurasia, such as Indo-European or Finno-Ugric, and this is the reason why the modern Altaic languages preserve few common elements&quot;.

In 1991 and again in 1996, Roy Miller defended the Altaic hypothesis and claimed that the criticisms of Clauson and Doerfer apply exclusively to the lexical correspondences, whereas the most pressing evidence for the theory is the similarities in verbal morphology.

In 2003, Claus Schönig published a critical overview of the history of the Altaic hypothesis up to that time, siding with the earlier criticisms of Clauson, Doerfer, and Shcherbak.

In 2003, Starostin, Anna Dybo and Oleg Mudrak published the &quot;Etymological Dictionary of the Altaic Languages&quot;, which expanded the 1991 lexical lists and added other phonological and grammatical arguments.

Starostin&#x27;s book was criticized by Stefan Georg in 2004 and 2005, and by Alexander Vovin in 2005.

Other defenses of the theory, in response to the criticisms of Georg and Vovin, were published by Starostin in 2005, Blažek in 2006, Robbeets in 2007, and Dybo and G. Starostin in 2008.

In 2010, Lars Johanson echoed Miller&#x27;s 1996 rebuttal to the critics, and called for a muting of the polemic.

===&quot;Transeurasian&quot; renaming===
In Robbeets and Johanson (2010), there was a proposal to replace the name &quot;Altaic&quot; with the name &quot;Transeurasian&quot;. While &quot;Altaic&quot; has sometimes included Japonic, Koreanic, and other languages or families, but only on the consideration of particular authors, &quot;Transeurasian&quot; was specifically intended to always include Turkic, Mongolic, Tungusic, Japonic, and Koreanic. Robbeets and Johanson gave as their reasoning for the new term: 1) to avoid confusion between the different uses of Altaic as to which group of languages is included, 2) to reduce the counterproductive polarization between &quot;Pro-Altaists&quot; and &quot;Anti-Altaists&quot;; 3) to broaden the applicability of the term because the suffix &quot;-ic&quot; implies affinity while &quot;-an&quot; leaves room for an areal hypothesis; and 4) to eliminate the reference to the Altai mountains as a potential homeland.

In Robbeets and Savelyev, ed. (2020) there was a concerted effort to distinguish &quot;Altaic&quot; as a subgroup of &quot;Transeurasian&quot; consisting only of Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic, while retaining &quot;Transeurasian&quot; as &quot;Altaic&quot; plus Japonic and Koreanic.

==Arguments==
===For the Altaic grouping===
====Phonological and grammatical features====
The original arguments for grouping the &quot;micro-Altaic&quot; languages within a Uralo-Altaic family were based on such shared features as vowel harmony and agglutination.

According to Roy Miller, the most pressing evidence for the theory is the similarities in verbal morphology.

The &quot;Etymological Dictionary&quot; by Starostin and others (2003) proposes a set of sound change laws that would explain the evolution from Proto-Altaic to the descendant languages. For example, although most of today&#x27;s Altaic languages have vowel harmony, Proto-Altaic as reconstructed by them lacked it; instead, various vowel assimilations between the first and second syllables of words occurred in Turkic, Mongolic, Tungusic, Korean, and Japonic. They also included a number of grammatical correspondences between the languages.

====Shared lexicon====
Starostin claimed in 1991 that the members of the proposed Altaic group shared about 15–20% of apparent cognates within a 110-word Swadesh-Yakhontov list; in particular, Turkic–Mongolic 20%, Turkic–Tungusic 18%, Turkic–Korean 17%, Mongolic–Tungusic 22%, Mongolic–Korean 16%, and Tungusic–Korean 21%. The 2003 &quot;Etymological Dictionary&quot; includes a list of 2,800 proposed cognate sets, as well as a few important changes to the reconstruction of Proto-Altaic. The authors tried hard to distinguish loans between Turkic and Mongolic and between Mongolic and Tungusic from cognates; and suggest words that occur in Turkic and Tungusic but not in Mongolic. All other combinations between the five branches also occur in the book. It lists 144 items of shared basic vocabulary, including words for such items as &#x27;eye&#x27;, &#x27;ear&#x27;, &#x27;neck&#x27;, &#x27;bone&#x27;, &#x27;blood&#x27;, &#x27;water&#x27;, &#x27;stone&#x27;, &#x27;sun&#x27;, and &#x27;two&#x27;.

Robbeets and Bouckaert (2018) use Bayesian phylolinguistic methods to argue for the coherence of the &quot;narrow&quot; Altaic languages (Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic) together with Japonic and Koreanic, which they refer to as the &quot;Transeurasian&quot; languages. Their results include the following phylogenetic tree:

Martine Robbeets et al. (2021) argues that early Transeurasian speakers were originally agriculturalists in Northeastern Asia, only becoming pastoralists later on.

The analysis conducted by Kassian et al. (2021) on a 110-item word list, specifically developed for each of the languages — Proto-Turkic, Proto-Mongolic, Proto-Tungusic, Middle Korean and Proto-Japonic — indicated partial support for the Altaic macrofamily, with Korean seemingly excluded. While acknowledging that prehistoric contacts are a plausible alternative explanation for the positive results, they deem such a scenario less likely for the lexical matches between Turkic and Japonic languages, which are better explained by genealogical relationship because of the substantial geographical distances involved.

===Against the grouping===
====Weakness of lexical and typological data====
According to G. Clauson (1956), G. Doerfer (1963), and A. Shcherbak (1963), many of the typological features of the supposed Altaic languages, particularly agglutinative strongly suffixing morphology and subject–object–verb (SOV) word order, often occur together in languages.

Those critics also argued that the words and features shared by Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic languages were for the most part borrowings and that the rest could be attributed to chance resemblances. They noted that there was little vocabulary shared by Turkic and Tungusic languages, though more shared with Mongolic languages. They reasoned that, if all three families had a common ancestor, we should expect losses to happen at random, and not only at the geographical margins of the family; and that the observed pattern is consistent with borrowing.

According to C. Schönig (2003), after accounting for areal effects, the shared lexicon that could have a common genetic origin was reduced to a small number of monosyllabic lexical roots, including the personal pronouns and a few other deictic and auxiliary items, whose sharing could be explained in other ways; not the kind of sharing expected in cases of genetic relationship.

====The Sprachbund hypothesis====

Instead of a common genetic origin, Clauson, Doerfer, and Shcherbak proposed (in 1956–1966) that Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic languages form a &quot;Sprachbund&quot;: a set of languages with similarities due to convergence through intensive borrowing and long contact, rather than common origin.

Asya Pereltsvaig further observed in 2011 that, in general, genetically related languages and families tend to diverge over time: the earlier forms are more similar than modern forms. However, she claims that an analysis of the earliest written records of Mongolic and Turkic languages shows the opposite, suggesting that they do not share a common traceable ancestor, but rather have become more similar through language contact and areal effects.

==Hypothesis about the original homeland==

The prehistory of the peoples speaking the &quot;Altaic&quot; languages is largely unknown. Whereas for certain other language families, such as the speakers of Indo-European, Uralic, and Austronesian, it is possible to frame substantial hypotheses, in the case of the proposed Altaic family much remains to be done.
Some scholars have hypothesised a possible Uralic and Altaic homeland in the Central Asian steppes.

Chaubey and van Driem propose that the dispersal of ancient Altaic language communities is reflected by the early Holocene dissemination of haplogroup C2 (M217): &quot;If the paternal lineage C2 (M217) is correlated with Altaic linguistic affinity, as appears to be the case for Turkic, Mongolic and Tungusic, then Japanese is no Father Tongue, and neither is Korean. This Y-chromosomal haplogroup accounts for 11% of Korean paternal lineages, and the frequency of the lineage is even more reduced in Japan. Yet this molecular marker may still be a tracer for the introduction of Altaic language to the archipelago, where the paternal lineage has persisted, albeit in a frequency of just 6%.&quot;

Juha Janhunen hypothesized that the ancestral languages of Turkic, Mongolic, Tungusic, Korean, and Japanese were spoken in a relatively small area comprising present-day North Korea, Southern Manchuria, and Southeastern Mongolia. However Janhunen is sceptical about an affiliation of Japanese to Altaic, while András Róna-Tas remarked that a relationship between Altaic and Japanese, if it ever existed, must be more remote than the relationship of any two of the Indo-European languages. Ramsey stated that &quot;the genetic relationship between Korean and Japanese, if it in fact exists, is probably more complex and distant than we can imagine on the basis of our present state of knowledge&quot;.

Supporters of the Altaic hypothesis formerly set the date of the Proto-Altaic language at around 4000 BC, but today at around 5000 BC or 6000 BC. This would make Altaic a language family older than Indo-European (around 3000 to 4000 BC according to mainstream hypotheses) but considerably younger than Afroasiatic (c. 10,000 BC or 11,000 to 16,000 BC according to different sources).

<text>Austrian German (), Austrian Standard German (ASG), Standard Austrian German (), Austrian High German (), or simply just Austrian (), is the variety of Standard German written and spoken in Austria and South Tyrol. It has the highest sociolinguistic prestige locally, as it is the variation used in the media and for other formal situations. In less formal situations, Austrians use Bavarian and Alemannic dialects, which are traditionally spoken but rarely written in Austria. It has been standardized with the publishing of the &quot;Österreichisches Wörterbuch&quot; in 1951.

==History==
Austrian German has its beginning in the mid-18th century, when Empress Maria Theresa and her son Joseph II introduced compulsory schooling in 1774, and several reforms of administration in their multilingual Habsburg Empire. At the time, the written standard was &quot;Oberdeutsche Schreibsprache&quot; (Upper German written language), which was highly influenced by the Bavarian and Alemannic dialects of Austria. Another option was to create a new standard based on the Southern German dialects, as proposed by the linguist Johann Siegmund Popowitsch. Instead they decided for pragmatic reasons to adopt the already-standardized chancellery language of Saxony (&quot;Sächsische Kanzleisprache&quot; or &quot;Meißner Kanzleideutsch&quot;), which was based on the administrative language of the non-Austrian area of Meißen and Dresden.
Austria High German (&quot;Hochdeutsch in Österreich&quot;, not to be confused with the Bavarian Austria German dialects) has the same geographic origin as the Swiss High German (&quot;Schweizer Hochdeutsch&quot;, not to be confused with the Alemannic Swiss German dialects).

The process of introducing the new written standard was led by Joseph von Sonnenfels.

Since 1951, the standardized form of Austrian German for official governmental use and in schools has been defined by the (&quot;Austrian Dictionary&quot;), published originally at the behest of the Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Arts and Culture (in the 1950s the &quot;Unterrichtsministerium&quot;, under minister Felix Hurdes) with Verlag Jugend &amp; Volk, then by the Österreichischer Bundesverlag.

==Standard Austrian German==
The German language is a polycentric language and Austrian German is one of its standardized forms. The official Austrian dictionary, , prescribes spelling rules that define the official language.

Austrian delegates participated in the international working group that drafted the German spelling reform of 1996 and several conferences leading up to the reform were hosted in Vienna at the invitation of the Austrian federal government. Austria adopted it as a signatory, along with Germany, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein, of an international memorandum of understanding () signed in Vienna in 1996.

The eszett or &quot;sharp s&quot; (ß) is used in Austria, as in Germany but not in Switzerland.


Distinctions in vocabulary persist, for example, in culinary terms, for which communication with Germans is frequently difficult, and administrative and legal language because of Austria&#x27;s exclusion from the development of a German nation-state in the late 19th century and its manifold particular traditions. A comprehensive collection of Austrian-German legal, administrative and economic terms is offered in &quot;Markhardt, Heidemarie: Wörterbuch der österreichischen Rechts-, Wirtschafts- und Verwaltungsterminologie&quot; (Peter Lang, 2006).

Because of German&#x27;s pluricentric nature, German dialects in Austria should not be confused with the variety of Standard Austrian German spoken by most Austrians, which is distinct from that of Germany or Switzerland. In the field of German dialectology, the notion of Standard Austrian German has been both debated and defended by German linguists since the 1970s. A One Standard German Axiom, effectively preventing the development of newer standards of German, has recently been offered as a characteristic of the field but has not been taken up.

===Former spoken standard===
Until 1918, the spoken standard in Austria was the , a sociolect spoken by the imperial Habsburg family and the nobility of Austria-Hungary. The sociolect, a variety of Standard German, is influenced by Viennese German and other Austro-Bavarian dialects spoken in eastern Austria but is slightly nasalized.

===Special written forms===
For many years, Austria had a special form of the language for official government documents that is known as , or &quot;Austrian chancellery language&quot;. It is a very traditional form of the language, probably derived from medieval deeds and documents, and has a very complex structure and vocabulary generally reserved for such documents. For most speakers (even native speakers), this form of the language is generally difficult to understand, as it contains many highly specialised terms for diplomatic, internal, official, and military matters. There are no regional variations because the special written form has been used mainly by a government that has now for centuries been based in Vienna.

 is now used less and less because of various administrative reforms that reduced the number of traditional civil servants (). As a result, Standard Austrian German is replacing it in government and administrative texts.

===European Union===
When Austria became a member of the European Union, 23 food-related terms were listed in its accession agreement as having the same legal status as the equivalent terms used in Germany, 
for example, the words for &quot;potato&quot;, &quot;tomato&quot;, and &quot;Brussels sprouts&quot;. (Examples in &quot;Vocabulary&quot;)
Austrian German is the only variety of a pluricentric language recognized under international law or EU primary law.

===Grammar===

====Verbs====
In Austria, as in the German-speaking parts of Switzerland and in southern Germany, verbs that express a state tend to use as the auxiliary verb in the perfect, as well as verbs of movement. Verbs which fall into this category include (to sit), (to lie) and, in parts of Styria and Carinthia, (to sleep). Therefore, the perfect of these verbs would be , and , respectively.

In Germany, the words (to stand) and (to confess) are identical in the present perfect: . The Austrian variant avoids that potential ambiguity ( from , &quot;to stand&quot;; and from , &quot;to confess&quot;: ).

In addition, the preterite (simple past) is very rarely used in Austria, especially in the spoken language, with the exception of some modal verbs (, ).

===Vocabulary===
There are many official terms that differ in Austrian German from their usage in most parts of Germany. Words used in Austria are (January) rather than , (seldom, February) along with , (this year) along with , (stairs) along with , (chimney) instead of , many administrative, legal and political terms, and many food terms, including the following:


There are, however, some false friends between the two regional varieties:
* (wardrobe) along with or instead of (and, similarly, along with , fridge), as opposed to (box) instead of . in Germany means both &quot;box&quot; and &quot;chest&quot;.
* (chair) instead of . means &quot;&quot; in Germany and means &quot;stool (faeces)&quot; in both varieties.

==Dialects==

===Classification===
*Dialects of the Austro-Bavarian group, which also comprises dialects from Bavaria
**Central Austro-Bavarian (along the main rivers Isar and Danube, spoken in the northern parts of the State of Salzburg, Upper Austria, Lower Austria, and northern Burgenland)
***Viennese German
**Southern Austro-Bavarian (in Tyrol, South Tyrol, Carinthia, Styria, and the southern parts of Salzburg and Burgenland)
*Vorarlbergerisch, spoken in Vorarlberg, is a High Alemannic dialect.

===Regional accents===
In addition to the standard variety, in everyday life most Austrians speak one of a number of Upper German dialects.

While strong forms of the various dialects are not fully mutually intelligible to northern Germans, communication is much easier in Bavaria, especially rural areas, where the Bavarian dialect still predominates as the mother tongue. The Central Austro-Bavarian dialects are more intelligible to speakers of Standard German than the Southern Austro-Bavarian dialects of Tyrol.

Viennese, the Austro-Bavarian dialect of Vienna, is seen for many in Germany as quintessentially Austrian. The people of Graz, the capital of Styria, speak yet another dialect which is not very Styrian and more easily understood by people from other parts of Austria than other Styrian dialects, for example from western Styria.

Simple words in the various dialects are very similar, but pronunciation is distinct for each and, after listening to a few spoken words, it may be possible for an Austrian to realise which dialect is being spoken. However, in regard to the dialects of the deeper valleys of the Tyrol, other Tyroleans are often unable to understand them. Speakers from the different provinces of Austria can easily be distinguished from each other by their particular accents (probably more so than Bavarians), those of Carinthia, Styria, Vienna, Upper Austria, and the Tyrol being very characteristic. Speakers from those regions, even those speaking Standard German, can usually be easily identified by their accent, even by an untrained listener.

Several of the dialects have been influenced by contact with non-Germanic linguistic groups, such as the dialect of Carinthia, where, in the past, many speakers were bilingual (and, in the southeastern portions of the state, many still are even today) with Slovene, and the dialect of Vienna, which has been influenced by immigration during the Austro-Hungarian period, particularly from what is today the Czech Republic. The German dialects of South Tyrol have been influenced by local Romance languages, particularly noticeable with the many loanwords from Italian and Ladin.

The geographic borderlines between the different accents (isoglosses) coincide strongly with the borders of the states and also with the border with Bavaria, with Bavarians having a markedly different rhythm of speech in spite of the linguistic similarities.

<text>In mathematics, the axiom of choice, abbreviated AC or AoC, is an axiom of set theory equivalent to the statement that &quot;a Cartesian product of a collection of non-empty sets is non-empty&quot;. Informally put, the axiom of choice says that given any collection of sets, each containing at least one element, it is possible to construct a new set by choosing one element from each set, even if the collection is infinite. Formally, it states that for every indexed family formula_1 of nonempty sets, there exists an indexed set formula_2 such that formula_3 for every formula_4. The axiom of choice was formulated in 1904 by Ernst Zermelo in order to formalize his proof of the well-ordering theorem.
The axiom of choice is equivalent to the statement that every partition has a transversal.

In many cases, a set created by choosing elements can be made without invoking the axiom of choice, particularly if the number of sets from which to choose the elements is finite, or if a canonical rule on how to choose the elements is available — some distinguishing property that happens to hold for exactly one element in each set. An illustrative example is sets picked from the natural numbers. From such sets, one may always select the smallest number, e.g. given the sets , the set containing each smallest element is {4, 10, 1}. In this case, &quot;select the smallest number&quot; is a choice function. Even if infinitely many sets are collected from the natural numbers, it will always be possible to choose the smallest element from each set to produce a set. That is, the choice function provides the set of chosen elements. But no definite choice function is known for the collection of all non-empty subsets of the real numbers. In that case, the axiom of choice must be invoked.

Bertrand Russell coined an analogy: for any (even infinite) collection of pairs of shoes, one can pick out the left shoe from each pair to obtain an appropriate collection (i.e. set) of shoes; this makes it possible to define a choice function directly. For an &quot;infinite&quot; collection of pairs of socks (assumed to have no distinguishing features such as being a left sock rather than a right sock), there is no obvious way to make a function that forms a set out of selecting one sock from each pair without invoking the axiom of choice.

Although originally controversial, the axiom of choice is now used without reservation by most mathematicians, and is included in the standard form of axiomatic set theory, Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice (ZFC). One motivation for this is that a number of generally accepted mathematical results, such as Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem, require the axiom of choice for their proofs. Contemporary set theorists also study axioms that are not compatible with the axiom of choice, such as the axiom of determinacy. The axiom of choice is avoided in some varieties of constructive mathematics, although there are varieties of constructive mathematics in which the axiom of choice is embraced.

==Statement==
A choice function (also called selector or selection) is a function formula_5, defined on a collection formula_6 of nonempty sets, such that for every set formula_7 in formula_6, formula_9 is an element of formula_7. With this concept, the axiom can be stated:
Formally, this may be expressed as follows:

:formula_11

Thus, the negation of the axiom may be expressed as the existence of a collection of nonempty sets which has no choice function. Formally, this may be derived making use of the logical equivalence of

:formula_12

Each choice function on a collection formula_6 of nonempty sets is an element of the Cartesian product of the sets in formula_6. This is not the most general situation of a Cartesian product of a family of sets, where a given set can occur more than once as a factor; however, one can focus on elements of such a product that select the same element every time a given set appears as factor, and such elements correspond to an element of the Cartesian product of all &quot;distinct&quot; sets in the family. The axiom of choice asserts the existence of such elements; it is therefore equivalent to:

:Given any family of nonempty sets, their Cartesian product is a nonempty set.

===Nomenclature===

In this article and other discussions of the Axiom of Choice the following abbreviations are common:
*AC – the Axiom of Choice. More rarely, AoC is used.
*ZF – Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory omitting the Axiom of Choice.
*ZFC – Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, extended to include the Axiom of Choice.

===Variants===

There are many other equivalent statements of the axiom of choice. These are equivalent in the sense that, in the presence of other basic axioms of set theory, they imply the axiom of choice and are implied by it.

One variation avoids the use of choice functions by, in effect, replacing each choice function with its range:

:Given any set formula_6, if the empty set is not an element of formula_6 and the elements of formula_6 are pairwise disjoint, then there exists a set formula_18 such that its intersection with any of the elements of formula_6 contains exactly one element.

This can be formalized in first-order logic as:

formula_20

Note that formula_21 is logically equivalent to formula_22.&lt;br&gt;
In English, this first-order sentence reads:

:Given any set formula_6,
:formula_6 contains the empty set as an element or
:the elements of formula_6 are not pairwise disjoint or
:there exists a set formula_6 such that its intersection with any of the elements of formula_6 contains exactly one element.

This guarantees for any partition of a set formula_6 the existence of a subset formula_18 of formula_6 containing exactly one element from each part of the partition.

Another equivalent axiom only considers collections formula_6 that are essentially powersets of other sets:
:For any set formula_7, the power set of formula_7 (with the empty set removed) has a choice function.
Authors who use this formulation often speak of the &quot;choice function on formula_7&quot;, but this is a slightly different notion of choice function. Its domain is the power set of formula_7 (with the empty set removed), and so makes sense for any set formula_7, whereas with the definition used elsewhere in this article, the domain of a choice function on a &quot;collection of sets&quot; is that collection, and so only makes sense for sets of sets. With this alternate notion of choice function, the axiom of choice can be compactly stated as

:Every set has a choice function.

which is equivalent to

:For any set formula_7 there is a function formula_38 such that for any non-empty subset formula_39 of formula_7, formula_41 lies in formula_39.

The negation of the axiom can thus be expressed as:

:There is a set formula_7 such that for all functions formula_5 (on the set of non-empty subsets of formula_7), there is a subset formula_39 such that formula_41 does not lie in formula_39.

===Restriction to finite sets===

The usual statement of the axiom of choice does not specify whether the collection of nonempty sets is finite or infinite, and thus implies that every finite collection of nonempty sets has a choice function. However, that particular case is a theorem of the Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice (ZF); it is easily proved by the principle of finite induction. In the even simpler case of a collection of &quot;one&quot; set, a choice function just corresponds to an element, so this instance of the axiom of choice says that every nonempty set has an element; this holds trivially. The axiom of choice can be seen as asserting the generalization of this property, already evident for finite collections, to arbitrary collections.

==Usage==
Until the late 19th century, the axiom of choice was often used implicitly, although it had not yet been formally stated. For example, after having established that the set &quot;X&quot; contains only non-empty sets, a mathematician might have said &quot;let &quot;F&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) be one of the members of &quot;s&quot; for all &quot;s&quot; in &quot;X&quot;&quot; to define a function &quot;F&quot;. In general, it is impossible to prove that &quot;F&quot; exists without the axiom of choice, but this seems to have gone unnoticed until Zermelo.

==Examples==
The nature of the individual nonempty sets in the collection may make it possible to avoid the axiom of choice even for certain infinite collections. For example, suppose that each member of the collection &quot;X&quot; is a nonempty subset of the natural numbers. Every such subset has a smallest element, so to specify our choice function we can simply say that it maps each set to the least element of that set. This gives us a definite choice of an element from each set, and makes it unnecessary to add the axiom of choice to our axioms of set theory.

The difficulty appears when there is no natural choice of elements from each set. If we cannot make explicit choices, how do we know that our selection forms a legitimate set (as defined by the other ZF axioms of set theory)? For example, suppose that &quot;X&quot; is the set of all non-empty subsets of the real numbers. First we might try to proceed as if &quot;X&quot; were finite. If we try to choose an element from each set, then, because &quot;X&quot; is infinite, our choice procedure will never come to an end, and consequently we shall never be able to produce a choice function for all of &quot;X&quot;. Next we might try specifying the least element from each set. But some subsets of the real numbers do not have least elements. For example, the open interval (0,1) does not have a least element: if &quot;x&quot; is in (0,1), then so is &quot;x&quot;/2, and &quot;x&quot;/2 is always strictly smaller than &quot;x&quot;. So this attempt also fails.

Additionally, consider for instance the unit circle &quot;S&quot;, and the action on &quot;S&quot; by a group &quot;G&quot; consisting of all rational rotations, that is, rotations by angles which are rational multiples of &quot;π&quot;. Here &quot;G&quot; is countable while &quot;S&quot; is uncountable. Hence &quot;S&quot; breaks up into uncountably many orbits under &quot;G&quot;. Using the axiom of choice, we could pick a single point from each orbit, obtaining an uncountable subset &quot;X&quot; of &quot;S&quot; with the property that all of its translates by &quot;G&quot; are disjoint from &quot;X&quot;. The set of those translates partitions the circle into a countable collection of pairwise disjoint sets, which are all pairwise congruent. Since &quot;X&quot; is not measurable for any rotation-invariant countably additive finite measure on &quot;S&quot;, finding an algorithm to form a set from selecting a point in each orbit requires that one add the axiom of choice to our axioms of set theory. See non-measurable set for more details.

In classical arithmetic, the natural numbers are well-ordered: for every nonempty subset of the natural numbers, there is a unique least element under the natural ordering. In this way, one may specify a set from any given subset. One might say, &quot;Even though the usual ordering of the real numbers does not work, it may be possible to find a different ordering of the real numbers which is a well-ordering. Then our choice function can choose the least element of every set under our unusual ordering.&quot; The problem then becomes that of constructing a well-ordering, which turns out to require the axiom of choice for its existence; every set can be well-ordered if and only if the axiom of choice holds.

==Criticism and acceptance==
A proof requiring the axiom of choice may establish the existence of an object without explicitly defining the object in the language of set theory. For example, while the axiom of choice implies that there is a well-ordering of the real numbers, there are models of set theory with the axiom of choice in which no individual well-ordering of the reals is definable. Similarly, although a subset of the real numbers that is not Lebesgue measurable can be proved to exist using the axiom of choice, it is consistent that no such set is definable.

The axiom of choice asserts the existence of these intangibles (objects that are proved to exist, but which cannot be explicitly constructed), which may conflict with some philosophical principles. Because there is no canonical well-ordering of all sets, a construction that relies on a well-ordering may not produce a canonical result, even if a canonical result is desired (as is often the case in category theory). This has been used as an argument against the use of the axiom of choice.

Another argument against the axiom of choice is that it implies the existence of objects that may seem counterintuitive. One example is the Banach–Tarski paradox, which says that it is possible to decompose the 3-dimensional solid unit ball into finitely many pieces and, using only rotations and translations, reassemble the pieces into two solid balls each with the same volume as the original. The pieces in this decomposition, constructed using the axiom of choice, are non-measurable sets.

Moreover, paradoxical consequences of the axiom of choice for the no-signaling principle in physics have recently been pointed out.

Despite these seemingly paradoxical results, most mathematicians accept the axiom of choice as a valid principle for proving new results in mathematics. But the debate is interesting enough that it is considered notable when a theorem in ZFC (ZF plus AC) is logically equivalent (with just the ZF axioms) to the axiom of choice, and mathematicians look for results that require the axiom of choice to be false, though this type of deduction is less common than the type that requires the axiom of choice to be true.

Theorems of ZF hold true in any model of that theory, regardless of the truth or falsity of the axiom of choice in that particular model. The implications of choice below, including weaker versions of the axiom itself, are listed because they are not theorems of ZF. The Banach–Tarski paradox, for example, is neither provable nor disprovable from ZF alone: it is impossible to construct the required decomposition of the unit ball in ZF, but also impossible to prove there is no such decomposition. Such statements can be rephrased as conditional statements—for example, &quot;If AC holds, then the decomposition in the Banach–Tarski paradox exists.&quot; Such conditional statements are provable in ZF when the original statements are provable from ZF and the axiom of choice.

==In constructive mathematics==

As discussed above, in the classical theory of ZFC, the axiom of choice enables nonconstructive proofs in which the existence of a type of object is proved without an explicit instance being constructed. In fact, in set theory and topos theory, Diaconescu&#x27;s theorem shows that the axiom of choice implies the law of excluded middle. The principle is thus not available in constructive set theory, where non-classical logic is employed.

The situation is different when the principle is formulated in Martin-Löf type theory. There and higher-order Heyting arithmetic, the appropriate statement of the axiom of choice is (depending on approach) included as an axiom or provable as a theorem. A cause for this difference is that the axiom of choice in type theory does not have the extensionality properties that the axiom of choice in constructive set theory does. The type theoretical context is discussed further below.

Different choice principles have been thoroughly studied in the constructive contexts and the principles&#x27; status varies between different school and varieties of the constructive mathematics.
Some results in constructive set theory use the axiom of countable choice or the axiom of dependent choice, which do not imply the law of the excluded middle. Errett Bishop, who is notable for developing a framework for constructive analysis, argued that an axiom of choice was constructively acceptable, saying

Although the axiom of countable choice in particular is commonly used in constructive mathematics, its use has also been questioned.

==Independence==

It has been known since as early as 1922 that the axiom of choice may fail in a variant of ZF with urelements, through the technique of permutation models introduced by Abraham Fraenkel and developed further by Andrzej Mostowski. The basic technique can be illustrated as follows: Let &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; and &quot;y&quot;&quot;n&quot; be distinct urelements for , and build a model where each set is symmetric under the interchange &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; ↔ &quot;y&quot;&quot;n&quot; for all but a finite number of &quot;n&quot;. Then the set can be in the model but sets such as cannot, and thus &quot;X&quot; cannot have a choice function.

In 1938, Kurt Gödel showed that the &quot;negation&quot; of the axiom of choice is not a theorem of ZF by constructing an inner model (the constructible universe) that satisfies ZFC, thus showing that ZFC is consistent if ZF itself is consistent. In 1963, Paul Cohen employed the technique of forcing, developed for this purpose, to show that, assuming ZF is consistent, the axiom of choice itself is not a theorem of ZF. He did this by constructing a much more complex model that satisfies ZF¬C (ZF with the negation of AC added as axiom) and thus showing that ZF¬C is consistent. Cohen&#x27;s model is a symmetric model, which is similar to permutation models, but uses &quot;generic&quot; subsets of the natural numbers (justified by forcing) in place of urelements.

Together these results establish that the axiom of choice is logically independent of ZF. The assumption that ZF is consistent is harmless because adding another axiom to an already inconsistent system cannot make the situation worse. Because of independence, the decision whether to use the axiom of choice (or its negation) in a proof cannot be made by appeal to other axioms of set theory. It must be made on other grounds.

One argument in favor of using the axiom of choice is that it is convenient because it allows one to prove some simplifying propositions that otherwise could not be proved. Many theorems provable using choice are of an elegant general character: the cardinalities of any two sets are comparable, every nontrivial ring with unity has a maximal ideal, every vector space has a basis, every connected graph has a spanning tree, and every product of compact spaces is compact, among many others. Frequently, the axiom of choice allows generalizing a theorem to &quot;larger&quot; objects. For example, it is provable without the axiom of choice that every vector space of finite dimension has a basis, but the generalization to all vector spaces requires the axiom of choice. Likewise, a finite product of compact spaces can be proven to be compact without the axiom of choice, but the generalization to infinite products (Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem) requires the axiom of choice.

The proof of the independence result also shows that a wide class of mathematical statements, including all statements that can be phrased in the language of Peano arithmetic, are provable in ZF if and only if they are provable in ZFC. Statements in this class include the statement that P = NP, the Riemann hypothesis, and many other unsolved mathematical problems. When attempting to solve problems in this class, it makes no difference whether ZF or ZFC is employed if the only question is the existence of a proof. It is possible, however, that there is a shorter proof of a theorem from ZFC than from ZF.

The axiom of choice is not the only significant statement that is independent of ZF. For example, the generalized continuum hypothesis (GCH) is not only independent of ZF, but also independent of ZFC. However, ZF plus GCH implies AC, making GCH a strictly stronger claim than AC, even though they are both independent of ZF.

==Stronger axioms==
The axiom of constructibility and the generalized continuum hypothesis each imply the axiom of choice and so are strictly stronger than it. In class theories such as Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory and Morse–Kelley set theory, there is an axiom called the axiom of global choice that is stronger than the axiom of choice for sets because it also applies to proper classes. The axiom of global choice follows from the axiom of limitation of size. Tarski&#x27;s axiom, which is used in Tarski–Grothendieck set theory and states (in the vernacular) that every set belongs to Grothendieck universe, is stronger than the axiom of choice.

==Equivalents==
There are important statements that, assuming the axioms of ZF but neither AC nor ¬AC, are equivalent to the axiom of choice. The most important among them are Zorn&#x27;s lemma and the well-ordering theorem. In fact, Zermelo initially introduced the axiom of choice in order to formalize his proof of the well-ordering theorem.

**Given two non-empty sets, one has a surjection to the other.
**Every surjective function has a right inverse.

**König&#x27;s theorem: Colloquially, the sum of a sequence of cardinals is strictly less than the product of a sequence of larger cardinals. (The reason for the term &quot;colloquially&quot; is that the sum or product of a &quot;sequence&quot; of cardinals cannot itself be defined without some aspect of the axiom of choice.)

**Zorn&#x27;s lemma: Every non-empty partially ordered set in which every chain (&quot;i.e.&quot;, totally ordered subset) has an upper bound contains at least one maximal element.

The special case where &quot;S&quot; is the set of all first-order sentences in a given signature is weaker, equivalent to the Boolean prime ideal theorem; see the section &quot;Weaker forms&quot; below.

*Graph theory
**Every connected graph has a spanning tree. Equivalently, every nonempty graph has a spanning forest.

===Category theory===
Several results in category theory invoke the axiom of choice for their proof. These results might be weaker than, equivalent to, or stronger than the axiom of choice, depending on the strength of the technical foundations. For example, if one defines categories in terms of sets, that is, as sets of objects and morphisms (usually called a small category), then there is no category of all sets, and so it is difficult for a category-theoretic formulation to apply to all sets. On the other hand, other foundational descriptions of category theory are considerably stronger, and an identical category-theoretic statement of choice may be stronger than the standard formulation, à la class theory, mentioned above.

Examples of category-theoretic statements which require choice include:
*Every small category has a skeleton.
*If two small categories are weakly equivalent, then they are equivalent.
*Every continuous functor on a small-complete category which satisfies the appropriate solution set condition has a left-adjoint (the Freyd adjoint functor theorem).

==Weaker forms==
There are several weaker statements that are not equivalent to the axiom of choice but are closely related. One example is the axiom of dependent choice (DC). A still weaker example is the axiom of countable choice (ACω or CC), which states that a choice function exists for any countable set of nonempty sets. These axioms are sufficient for many proofs in elementary mathematical analysis, and are consistent with some principles, such as the Lebesgue measurability of all sets of reals, that are disprovable from the full axiom of choice.

Given an ordinal parameter α ≥ ω+2 — for every set &quot;S&quot; with rank less than α, &quot;S&quot; is well-orderable. Given an ordinal parameter α ≥ 1 — for every set &quot;S&quot; with Hartogs number less than ωα, &quot;S&quot; is well-orderable. As the ordinal parameter is increased, these approximate the full axiom of choice more and more closely.

Other choice axioms weaker than axiom of choice include the Boolean prime ideal theorem and the axiom of uniformization. The former is equivalent in ZF to Tarski&#x27;s 1930 ultrafilter lemma: every filter is a subset of some ultrafilter.

===Results requiring AC (or weaker forms) but weaker than it===
One of the most interesting aspects of the axiom of choice is the large number of places in mathematics where it shows up. Here are some statements that require the axiom of choice in the sense that they are not provable from ZF but are provable from ZFC (ZF plus AC). Equivalently, these statements are true in all models of ZFC but false in some models of ZF.

*Set theory
**The ultrafilter lemma (with ZF) can be used to prove the Axiom of choice for finite sets: Given formula_49 and a collection formula_50 of non-empty sets, their product formula_51 is not empty.
**The union of any countable family of countable sets is countable (this requires countable choice but not the full axiom of choice).
**If the set &quot;A&quot; is infinite, then there exists an injection from the natural numbers N to &quot;A&quot; (see Dedekind infinite).
**Eight definitions of a finite set are equivalent.
**Every infinite game formula_52 in which formula_53 is a Borel subset of Baire space is determined.
* Every infinite cardinal &quot;κ&quot; satisfies 2×&quot;κ&quot; = &quot;κ&quot;.
*Measure theory
**The Vitali theorem on the existence of non-measurable sets, which states that there exists a subset of the real numbers that is not Lebesgue measurable.
**There exist Lebesgue-measurable subsets of the real numbers that are not Borel sets. That is, the Borel σ-algebra on the real numbers (which is generated by all real intervals) is strictly included the Lebesgue-measure σ-algebra on the real numbers.
**The Hausdorff paradox.
**The Banach–Tarski paradox.
*Algebra
**Every field has an algebraic closure.
**Every field extension has a transcendence basis.
**Every infinite-dimensional vector space contains an infinite linearly independent subset (this requires dependent choice, but not the full axiom of choice).
**Stone&#x27;s representation theorem for Boolean algebras needs the Boolean prime ideal theorem.
**The Nielsen–Schreier theorem, that every subgroup of a free group is free.
**The additive groups of R and C are isomorphic.

**The Banach–Alaoglu theorem about compactness of sets of functionals.
**The Baire category theorem about complete metric spaces, and its consequences, such as the open mapping theorem and the closed graph theorem.
**On every infinite-dimensional topological vector space there is a discontinuous linear map.
*General topology
**A uniform space is compact if and only if it is complete and totally bounded.
**Every Tychonoff space has a Stone–Čech compactification.
*Mathematical logic
**Gödel&#x27;s completeness theorem for first-order logic: every consistent set of first-order sentences has a completion. That is, every consistent set of first-order sentences can be extended to a maximal consistent set.
**The compactness theorem: If formula_54 is a set of first-order (or alternatively, zero-order) sentences such that every finite subset of formula_54 has a model, then formula_54 has a model.

===Possibly equivalent implications of AC===
There are several historically important set-theoretic statements implied by AC whose equivalence to AC is open. Zermelo cited the partition principle, which was formulated before AC itself, as a justification for believing AC. In 1906, Russell declared PP to be equivalent, but whether the partition principle implies AC is the oldest open problem in set theory, and the equivalences of the other statements are similarly hard old open problems. In every &quot;known&quot; model of ZF where choice fails, these statements fail too, but it is unknown whether they can hold without choice.

*Set theory
**Partition principle: if there is a surjection from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot;, there is an injection from &quot;B&quot; to &quot;A&quot;. Equivalently, every partition &quot;P&quot; of a set &quot;S&quot; is less than or equal to &quot;S&quot; in size.
**Converse Schröder–Bernstein theorem: if two sets have surjections to each other, they are equinumerous.
**Weak partition principle: if there is an injection and a surjection from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot;, then &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are equinumerous. Equivalently, a partition of a set &quot;S&quot; cannot be strictly larger than &quot;S&quot;. If WPP holds, this already implies the existence of a non-measurable set. Each of the previous three statements is implied by the preceding one, but it is unknown if any of these implications can be reversed.
**There is no infinite decreasing sequence of cardinals. The equivalence was conjectured by Schoenflies in 1905.
*Abstract algebra
**Hahn embedding theorem: Every ordered abelian group &quot;G&quot; order-embeds as a subgroup of the additive group formula_57 endowed with a lexicographical order, where Ω is the set of Archimedean equivalence classes of &quot;G&quot;. This equivalence was conjectured by Hahn in 1907.

==Stronger forms of the negation of AC==
If we abbreviate by BP the claim that every set of real numbers has the property of Baire, then BP is stronger than ¬AC, which asserts the nonexistence of any choice function on perhaps only a single set of nonempty sets. Strengthened negations may be compatible with weakened forms of AC. For example, ZF + DC + BP is consistent, if ZF is.

It is also consistent with ZF + DC that every set of reals is Lebesgue measurable, but this consistency result, due to Robert M. Solovay, cannot be proved in ZFC itself, but requires a mild large cardinal assumption (the existence of an inaccessible cardinal). The much stronger axiom of determinacy, or AD, implies that every set of reals is Lebesgue measurable, has the property of Baire, and has the perfect set property (all three of these results are refuted by AC itself). ZF + DC + AD is consistent provided that a sufficiently strong large cardinal axiom is consistent (the existence of infinitely many Woodin cardinals).

Quine&#x27;s system of axiomatic set theory, New Foundations (NF), takes its name from the title (&quot;New Foundations for Mathematical Logic&quot;) of the 1937 article that introduced it. In the NF axiomatic system, the axiom of choice can be disproved.

==Statements implying the negation of AC==
There are models of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory in which the axiom of choice is false. We shall abbreviate &quot;Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory plus the negation of the axiom of choice&quot; by ZF¬C. For certain models of ZF¬C, it is possible to validate the negation of some standard ZFC theorems. As any model of ZF¬C is also a model of ZF, it is the case that for each of the following statements, there exists a model of ZF in which that statement is true.

*The negation of the weak partition principle: There is a set that can be partitioned into strictly more equivalence classes than the original set has elements, and a function whose domain is strictly smaller than its range. In fact, this is the case in all &quot;known&quot; models.
*There is a function &quot;f&quot; from the real numbers to the real numbers such that &quot;f&quot; is not continuous at &quot;a&quot;, but &quot;f&quot; is sequentially continuous at &quot;a&quot;, i.e., for any sequence {&quot;xn&quot;} converging to &quot;a&quot;, lim&quot;n&quot; f(&quot;xn&quot;)=f(a).
*There is an infinite set of real numbers without a countably infinite subset.
*The real numbers are a countable union of countable sets. This does not imply that the real numbers are countable: As pointed out above, to show that a countable union of countable sets is itself countable requires the Axiom of countable choice.
*There is a field with no algebraic closure.
*In all models of ZF¬C there is a vector space with no basis.
*There is a vector space with two bases of different cardinalities.
*There is a free complete Boolean algebra on countably many generators.
*There is a set that cannot be linearly ordered.
*There exists a model of ZF¬C in which every set in R&quot;n&quot; is measurable. Thus it is possible to exclude counterintuitive results like the Banach–Tarski paradox which are provable in ZFC. Furthermore, this is possible whilst assuming the Axiom of dependent choice, which is weaker than AC but sufficient to develop most of real analysis.
*In all models of ZF¬C, the generalized continuum hypothesis does not hold.

For proofs, see .

Additionally, by imposing definability conditions on sets (in the sense of descriptive set theory) one can often prove restricted versions of the axiom of choice from axioms incompatible with general choice. This appears, for example, in the Moschovakis coding lemma.

== Axiom of choice in type theory ==

In type theory, a different kind of statement is known as the axiom of choice. This form begins with two types, σ and τ, and a relation &quot;R&quot; between objects of type σ and objects of type τ. The axiom of choice states that if for each &quot;x&quot; of type σ there exists a &quot;y&quot; of type τ such that &quot;R&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;), then there is a function &quot;f&quot; from objects of type σ to objects of type τ such that &quot;R&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)) holds for all &quot;x&quot; of type σ:
:formula_58
Unlike in set theory, the axiom of choice in type theory is typically stated as an axiom scheme, in which &quot;R&quot; varies over all formulas or over all formulas of a particular logical form.

<text>Attila ( or ; ), frequently called Attila the Hun, was the ruler of the Huns from 434 until his death in early 453. He was also the leader of an empire consisting of Huns, Ostrogoths, Alans, and Gepids, among others, in Central and Eastern Europe.

As nephews to Rugila, Attila and his elder brother Bleda succeeded him to the throne in 435, ruling jointly until the death of Bleda in 445. During his reign, Attila was one of the most feared enemies of the Western and Eastern Roman Empires. He crossed the Danube twice and plundered the Balkans but was unable to take Constantinople. In 441, he led an invasion of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire, the success of which emboldened him to invade the West. He also attempted to conquer Roman Gaul (modern France), crossing the Rhine in 451 and marching as far as Aurelianum (Orléans), before being stopped in the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains.

He subsequently invaded Italy, devastating the northern provinces, but was unable to take Rome. He planned for further campaigns against the Romans but died in 453. After Attila&#x27;s death, his close adviser, Ardaric of the Gepids, led a Germanic revolt against Hunnic rule, after which the Hunnic Empire quickly collapsed. Attila lived on as a character in Germanic heroic legend.

== Etymology ==
Many scholars have argued that the name Attila derives from East Germanic origin; &quot;Attila&quot; is formed from the Gothic or Gepidic noun &quot;atta&quot;, &quot;father&quot;, by means of the diminutive suffix &quot;-ila&quot;, meaning &quot;little father&quot;, compare Wulfila from &quot;wulfs&quot; &quot;wolf&quot; and &quot;-ila&quot;, i.e. &quot;little wolf&quot;. The Gothic etymology was first proposed by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm in the early 19th century. Maenchen-Helfen notes that this derivation of the name &quot;offers neither phonetic nor semantic difficulties&quot;, and Gerhard Doerfer notes that the name is simply correct Gothic. Alexander Savelyev and Choongwon Jeong (2020) similarly state that Attila&#x27;s name &quot;must have been Gothic in origin.&quot; The name has sometimes been interpreted as a Germanization of a name of Hunnic origin.

Other scholars have argued for a Turkic origin of the name. Omeljan Pritsak considered &quot;Ἀττίλα&quot; (Attíla) a composite title-name which derived from Turkic *&quot;es&quot; (great, old), and *&quot;til&quot; (sea, ocean), and the suffix /a/. The stressed back syllabic &quot;til&quot; assimilated the front member &quot;es&quot;, so it became *&quot;as&quot;. It is a nominative, in form of &quot;attíl-&quot; (&lt; *&quot;etsíl&quot; &lt; *&quot;es tíl&quot;) with the meaning &quot;the oceanic, universal ruler&quot;. J. J. Mikkola connected it with Turkic &quot;āt&quot; (name, fame). As another Turkic possibility, H. Althof (1902) considered it was related to Turkish &quot;atli&quot; (horseman, cavalier), or Turkish &quot;at&quot; (horse) and &quot;dil&quot; (tongue). Maenchen-Helfen argues that Pritsak&#x27;s derivation is &quot;ingenious but for many reasons unacceptable&quot;, while dismissing Mikkola&#x27;s as &quot;too farfetched to be taken seriously&quot;. M. Snædal similarly notes that none of these proposals has achieved wide acceptance.

Criticizing the proposals of finding Turkic or other etymologies for Attila, Doerfer notes that King George VI of the United Kingdom had a name of Greek origin, and Süleyman the Magnificent had a name of Arabic origin, yet that does not make them Greek or Arab: it is therefore plausible that Attila would have a name not of Hunnic origin. Historian Hyun Jin Kim, however, has argued that the Turkic etymology is &quot;more probable&quot;.

M. Snædal, in a paper that rejects the Germanic derivation but notes the problems with the existing proposed Turkic etymologies, argues that Attila&#x27;s name could have originated from Turkic-Mongolian &quot;at&quot;, &quot;adyy/agta&quot; (gelding, warhorse) and Turkish &quot;atlı&quot; (horseman, cavalier), meaning &quot;possessor of geldings, provider of warhorses&quot;.

== Historiography and sources ==

The historiography of Attila is faced with a major challenge, in that the only complete sources are written in Greek and Latin by the enemies of the Huns. Attila&#x27;s contemporaries left many testimonials of his life, but only fragments of these remain. Priscus was a Byzantine diplomat and historian who wrote in Greek, and he was both a witness to and an actor in the story of Attila, as a member of the embassy of Theodosius II at the Hunnic court in 449. He was obviously biased by his political position, but his writing is a major source for information on the life of Attila, and he is the only person known to have recorded a physical description of him. He wrote a history of the late Roman Empire in eight books covering the period from 430 to 476.

Only fragments of Priscus&#x27; work remain. It was cited extensively by 6th-century historians Procopius and Jordanes, especially in Jordanes&#x27; &quot;The Origin and Deeds of the Goths&quot;, which contains numerous references to Priscus&#x27;s history, and it is also an important source of information about the Hunnic empire and its neighbors. He describes the legacy of Attila and the Hunnic people for a century after Attila&#x27;s death. Marcellinus Comes, a chancellor of Justinian during the same era, also describes the relations between the Huns and the Eastern Roman Empire.

Numerous ecclesiastical writings contain useful but scattered information, sometimes difficult to authenticate or distorted by years of hand-copying between the 6th and 17th centuries. The Hungarian writers of the 12th century wished to portray the Huns in a positive light as their glorious ancestors, and so repressed certain historical elements and added their own legends.

The literature and knowledge of the Huns themselves was transmitted orally, by means of epics and chanted poems that were handed down from generation to generation. Indirectly, fragments of this oral history have reached us via the literature of the Scandinavians and Germans, neighbors of the Huns who wrote between the 9th and 13th centuries. Attila is a major character in many Medieval epics, such as the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;, as well as various Eddas and sagas.

Archaeological investigation has uncovered some details about the lifestyle, art, and warfare of the Huns. There are a few traces of battles and sieges, but the tomb of Attila and the location of his capital have not yet been found.

== Appearance and character ==
There is no surviving first-hand account of Attila&#x27;s appearance, but there is a possible second-hand source provided by Jordanes, who cites a description given by Priscus.

Some scholars have suggested that these features are typically East Asian, because in combination they fit the physical type of people from Eastern Asia, so Attila&#x27;s ancestors may have come from there. Other historians have suggested that the same features may have been typical of some Scythian people.

== Early life and background ==
The Huns were a group of Eurasian nomads, appearing from east of the Volga, who migrated further into Western Europe c. 370 and built up an enormous empire there. Their main military techniques were mounted archery and javelin throwing. They were in the process of developing settlements before their arrival in Western Europe, yet the Huns were a society of pastoral warriors whose primary form of nourishment was meat and milk, products of their herds.

The origin and language of the Huns has been the subject of debate for centuries. According to some theories, their leaders at least may have spoken a Turkic language, perhaps closest to the modern Chuvash language. According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of European Peoples&quot;, &quot;the Huns, especially those who migrated to the west, may have been a combination of central Asian Turkic, Mongolic, and Ugric stocks&quot;.

Attila&#x27;s father Mundzuk was the brother of kings Octar and Ruga, who reigned jointly over the Hunnic empire in the early fifth century. This form of diarchy was recurrent with the Huns, but historians are unsure whether it was institutionalized, merely customary, or an occasional occurrence. His family was from a noble lineage, but it is uncertain whether they constituted a royal dynasty. Attila&#x27;s birthdate is debated; journalist Éric Deschodt and writer Herman Schreiber have proposed a date of 395. However, historian Iaroslav Lebedynsky and archaeologist Katalin Escher prefer an estimate between the 390s and the first decade of the fifth century. Several historians have proposed 406 as the date.

Attila grew up in a rapidly changing world. His people were nomads who had only recently arrived in Europe. They crossed the Volga river during the 370s and annexed the territory of the Alans, then attacked the Gothic kingdom between the Carpathian Mountains and the Danube. They were a very mobile people, whose mounted archers had acquired a reputation for invincibility, and the Germanic tribes seemed unable to withstand them. Vast populations fleeing the Huns moved from Germania into the Roman Empire in the west and south, and along the banks of the Rhine and Danube. In 376, the Goths crossed the Danube, initially submitting to the Romans but soon rebelling against Emperor Valens, whom they killed in the Battle of Adrianople in 378. Large numbers of Vandals, Alans, Suebi, and Burgundians crossed the Rhine and invaded Roman Gaul on December 31, 406, to escape the Huns. The Roman Empire had been split in half since 395 and was ruled by two distinct governments, one based in Ravenna in the West, and the other in Constantinople in the East. The Roman Emperors, both East and West, were generally from the Theodosian family in Attila&#x27;s lifetime (despite several power struggles).

The Huns dominated a vast territory with nebulous borders determined by the will of a constellation of ethnically varied peoples. Some were assimilated to Hunnic nationality, whereas many retained their own identities and rulers but acknowledged the suzerainty of the king of the Huns. The Huns were also the indirect source of many of the Romans&#x27; problems, driving various Germanic tribes into Roman territory, yet relations between the two empires were cordial: the Romans used the Huns as mercenaries against the Germans and even in their civil wars. Thus, the usurper Joannes was able to recruit thousands of Huns for his army against Valentinian III in 424. It was Aëtius, later Patrician of the West, who managed this operation. They exchanged ambassadors and hostages, the alliance lasting from 401 to 450 and permitting the Romans numerous military victories. The Huns considered the Romans to be paying them tribute, whereas the Romans preferred to view this as payment for services rendered. The Huns had become a great power by the time that Attila came of age during the reign of his uncle Ruga, to the point that Nestorius, the Patriarch of Constantinople, deplored the situation with these words: &quot;They have become both masters and slaves of the Romans&quot;.

== Campaigns against the Eastern Roman Empire ==

The death of Rugila (also known as Rua or Ruga) in 434 left the sons of his brother Mundzuk, Attila and Bleda, in control of the united Hun tribes. At the time of the two brothers&#x27; accession, the Hun tribes were bargaining with Eastern Roman Emperor Theodosius II&#x27;s envoys for the return of several who had taken refuge within the Eastern Roman Empire, possibly Hunnic nobles who disagreed with the brothers&#x27; assumption of leadership.

The following year, Attila and Bleda met with the imperial legation at Margus (Požarevac), all seated on horseback in the Hunnic manner, and negotiated an advantageous treaty. The Romans agreed to return the fugitives, to double their previous tribute of 350 Roman pounds (c. 115 kg) of gold, to open their markets to Hunnish traders, and to pay a ransom of eight &quot;solidi&quot; for each Roman taken prisoner by the Huns. The Huns, satisfied with the treaty, decamped from the Roman Empire and returned to their home in the Great Hungarian Plain, perhaps to consolidate and strengthen their empire. Theodosius used this opportunity to strengthen the walls of Constantinople, building the city&#x27;s first sea wall, and to build up his border defenses along the Danube.

The Huns remained out of Roman sight for the next few years while they invaded the Sassanid Empire. They were defeated in Armenia by the Sassanids, abandoned their invasion, and turned their attentions back to Europe. In 440, they reappeared in force on the borders of the Roman Empire, attacking the merchants at the market on the north bank of the Danube that had been established by the treaty of 435.

Crossing the Danube, they laid waste to the cities of Illyricum and forts on the river, including (according to Priscus) Viminacium, a city of Moesia. Their advance began at Margus, where they demanded that the Romans turn over a bishop who had retained property that Attila regarded as his. While the Romans discussed the bishop&#x27;s fate, he slipped away secretly to the Huns and betrayed the city to them.

While the Huns attacked city-states along the Danube, the Vandals (led by Geiseric) captured the Western Roman province of Africa and its capital of Carthage. Africa was the richest province of the Western Empire and a main source of food for Rome. The Sassanid Shah Yazdegerd II invaded Armenia in 441.

The Romans stripped the Balkan area of forces, sending them to Sicily in order to mount an expedition against the Vandals in Africa. This left Attila and Bleda a clear path through Illyricum into the Balkans, which they invaded in 441. The Hunnish army sacked Margus and Viminacium, and then took Singidunum (Belgrade) and Sirmium. During 442, Theodosius recalled his troops from Sicily and ordered a large issue of new coins to finance operations against the Huns. He believed that he could defeat the Huns and refused the Hunnish kings&#x27; demands.

Attila responded with a campaign in 443. For the first time (as far as the Romans knew) his forces were equipped with battering rams and rolling siege towers, with which they successfully assaulted the military centers of Ratiara and Naissus (Niš) and massacred the inhabitants. Priscus said &quot;When we arrived at Naissus we found the city deserted, as though it had been sacked; only a few sick persons lay in the churches. We halted at a short distance from the river, in an open space, for all the ground adjacent to the bank was full of the bones of men slain in war.&quot;

Advancing along the Nišava River, the Huns next took Serdica (Sofia), Philippopolis (Plovdiv), and Arcadiopolis (Lüleburgaz). They encountered and destroyed a Roman army outside Constantinople but were stopped by the double walls of the Eastern capital. They defeated a second army near Callipolis (Gelibolu).

Theodosius, unable to make effective armed resistance, admitted defeat, sending the &quot;Magister militum per Orientem&quot; Anatolius to negotiate peace terms. The terms were harsher than the previous treaty: the Emperor agreed to hand over 6,000 Roman pounds (c. 2000 kg) of gold as punishment for having disobeyed the terms of the treaty during the invasion; the yearly tribute was tripled, rising to 2,100 Roman pounds (c. 700 kg) in gold; and the ransom for each Roman prisoner rose to 12 &quot;solidi&quot;.

Their demands were met for a time, and the Hun kings withdrew into the interior of their empire. Bleda died following the Huns&#x27; withdrawal from Byzantium (probably around 445). Attila then took the throne for himself, becoming the sole ruler of the Huns.

== Solitary kingship ==
In 447, Attila again rode south into the Eastern Roman Empire through Moesia. The Roman army, under Gothic &quot;magister militum&quot; Arnegisclus, met him in the Battle of the Utus and was defeated, though not without inflicting heavy losses. The Huns were left unopposed and rampaged through the Balkans as far as Thermopylae.

Constantinople itself was saved by the Isaurian troops of &quot;magister militum per Orientem&quot; Zeno and protected by the intervention of prefect Constantinus, who organized the reconstruction of the walls that had been previously damaged by earthquakes and, in some places, to construct a new line of fortification in front of the old. Callinicus, in his &quot;Life of Saint Hypatius&quot;, wrote:

== In the west ==

In 450, Attila proclaimed his intent to attack the Visigoth kingdom of Toulouse by making an alliance with Emperor Valentinian III. He had previously been on good terms with the Western Roman Empire and its influential general Flavius Aëtius. Aëtius had spent a brief exile among the Huns in 433, and the troops that Attila provided against the Goths and Bagaudae had helped earn him the largely honorary title of &quot;magister militum&quot; in the west. The gifts and diplomatic efforts of Geiseric, who opposed and feared the Visigoths, may also have influenced Attila&#x27;s plans.

However, Valentinian&#x27;s sister was Honoria, who had sent the Hunnish king a plea for help—and her engagement ring—in order to escape her forced betrothal to a Roman senator in the spring of 450. Honoria may not have intended a proposal of marriage, but Attila chose to interpret her message as such. He accepted, asking for half of the western Empire as dowry.

When Valentinian discovered the plan, only the influence of his mother Galla Placidia convinced him to exile Honoria, rather than killing her. He also wrote to Attila, strenuously denying the legitimacy of the supposed marriage proposal. Attila sent an emissary to Ravenna to proclaim that Honoria was innocent, that the proposal had been legitimate, and that he would come to claim what was rightfully his.

Attila interfered in a succession struggle after the death of a Frankish ruler. Attila supported the elder son, while Aëtius supported the younger. (The location and identity of these kings is not known and subject to conjecture.) Attila gathered his vassals—Gepids, Ostrogoths, Rugians, Scirians, Heruls, Thuringians, Alans, Burgundians, among others—and began his march west. In 451, he arrived in Belgica with an army exaggerated by Jordanes to half a million strong.

On April 7, he captured Metz. He also captured Strasbourg. Other cities attacked can be determined by the hagiographic &quot;vitae&quot; written to commemorate their bishops: Nicasius was slaughtered before the altar of his church in Rheims; Servatus is alleged to have saved Tongeren with his prayers, as Saint Genevieve is said to have saved Paris. Lupus, bishop of Troyes, is also credited with saving his city by meeting Attila in person.

Aëtius moved to oppose Attila, gathering troops from among the Franks, the Burgundians, and the Celts. A mission by Avitus and Attila&#x27;s continued westward advance convinced the Visigoth king Theodoric I (Theodorid) to ally with the Romans. The combined armies reached Orléans ahead of Attila, thus checking and turning back the Hunnish advance. Aëtius gave chase and caught the Huns at a place usually assumed to be near Catalaunum (modern Châlons-en-Champagne). Attila decided to fight the Romans on plains where he could use his cavalry.

The two armies clashed in the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains, the outcome of which is commonly considered to be a strategic victory for the Visigothic-Roman alliance. Theodoric was killed in the fighting, and Aëtius failed to press his advantage, according to Edward Gibbon and Edward Creasy, because he feared the consequences of an overwhelming Visigothic triumph as much as he did a defeat. From Aëtius&#x27; point of view, the best outcome was what occurred: Theodoric died, Attila was in retreat and disarray, and the Romans had the benefit of appearing victorious.

== Invasion of Italy and death ==
Attila returned in 452 to renew his marriage claim with Honoria, invading and ravaging Italy along the way. Communities became established in what would later become Venice as a result of these attacks when the residents fled to small islands in the Venetian Lagoon. His army sacked numerous cities and razed Aquileia so completely that it was afterwards hard to recognize its original site. Aëtius lacked the strength to offer battle, but managed to harass and slow Attila&#x27;s advance with only a shadow force. Attila finally halted at the River Po. By this point, disease and starvation may have taken hold in Attila&#x27;s camp, thus hindering his war efforts and potentially contributing to the cessation of invasion.

Emperor Valentinian III sent three envoys, the high civilian officers Gennadius Avienus and Trigetius, as well as Pope Leo I, who met Attila at Mincio in the vicinity of Mantua and obtained from him the promise that he would withdraw from Italy and negotiate peace with the Emperor. Prosper of Aquitaine gives a short description of the historic meeting, but gives all the credit to Leo for the successful negotiation. Priscus reports that superstitious fear of the fate of Alaric gave him pause—as Alaric died shortly after sacking Rome in 410.

Italy had suffered from a terrible famine in 451 and her crops were faring little better in 452. Attila&#x27;s devastating invasion of the plains of northern Italy this year did not improve the harvest. To advance on Rome would have required supplies which were not available in Italy, and taking the city would not have improved Attila&#x27;s supply situation. Therefore, it was more profitable for Attila to conclude peace and retreat to his homeland.

Furthermore, an East Roman force had crossed the Danube under the command of another officer also named Aetius—who had participated in the Council of Chalcedon the previous year—and proceeded to defeat the Huns who had been left behind by Attila to safeguard their home territories. Attila, hence, faced heavy human and natural pressures to retire &quot;from Italy without ever setting foot south of the Po&quot;. As Hydatius writes in his &quot;Chronica Minora&quot;:
===Death===

In the Eastern Roman Empire, Emperor Marcian succeeded Theodosius II, and stopped paying tribute to the Huns. Attila withdrew from Italy to his palace across the Danube, while making plans to strike at Constantinople once more to reclaim tribute.

However, he died in the early months of 453.

The conventional account from Priscus says that Attila was at a feast celebrating his latest marriage, this time to the beautiful young Ildico (the name suggests Gothic or Ostrogoth origins). In the midst of the revels, however, he suffered severe bleeding and died. He may have had a nosebleed and choked to death in a stupor. Or he may have succumbed to internal bleeding, possibly due to ruptured esophageal varices. Esophageal varices are dilated veins that form in the lower part of the esophagus, often caused by years of excessive alcohol consumption; they are fragile and can easily rupture, leading to death by hemorrhage.

Another account of his death was first recorded 80 years after the events by Roman chronicler Marcellinus Comes. It reports that &quot;Attila, King of the Huns and ravager of the provinces of Europe, was pierced by the hand and blade of his wife&quot;. One modern analyst suggests that he was assassinated, but most reject these accounts as no more than hearsay, preferring instead the account given by Attila&#x27;s contemporary Priscus, recounted in the 6th century by Jordanes:

=== Descendants===
Attila&#x27;s sons Ellac, Dengizich and Ernak, &quot;in their rash eagerness to rule they all alike destroyed his empire&quot;. They &quot;were clamoring that the nations should be divided among them equally and that warlike kings with their peoples should be apportioned to them by lot like a family estate&quot;. Against the treatment as &quot;slaves of the basest condition&quot; a Germanic alliance led by the Gepid ruler Ardaric (who was noted for great loyalty to Attila) revolted and fought with the Huns in Pannonia in the Battle of Nedao 454 AD. Attila&#x27;s eldest son Ellac was killed in that battle. Attila&#x27;s sons &quot;regarding the Goths as deserters from their rule, came against them as though they were seeking fugitive slaves&quot;, attacked Ostrogothic co-ruler Valamir (who also fought alongside Ardaric and Attila at the Catalaunian Plains), but were repelled, and some group of Huns moved to Scythia (probably those of Ernak). His brother Dengizich attempted a renewed invasion across the Danube in 468 AD, but was defeated at the Battle of Bassianae by the Ostrogoths. Dengizich was killed by Roman-Gothic general Anagast the following year, after which the Hunnic dominion ended.

Many of Attila&#x27;s close relatives are known by name, and some even by deeds, but valid genealogical sources are rare, and there seems to be no verifiable way to trace Attila&#x27;s descendants beyond a few generations. This has not stopped many genealogists from attempting to reconstruct a valid line of descent to various medieval rulers. One of the most credible claims has been that of the &quot;Nominalia of the Bulgarian khans&quot; for mythological Avitohol and Irnik from the Dulo clan of the Bulgars. The Hungarian Árpád dynasty also claimed to be a direct descendant of Attila. Medieval Hungarian chronicles from the Hungarian royal court like &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot;, &quot;Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum&quot;, &quot;Chronicon Pictum&quot;, &quot;Buda Chronicle&quot;, &quot;Chronica Hungarorum&quot; claimed that the Árpád dynasty and the Aba clan are the descendants of Attila.

== Later folklore and iconography ==

The name has many variants in several languages: Atli and Atle in Old Norse; Etzel in Middle High German (Nibelungenlied); Ætla in Old English; Attila, Atilla, and Etele in Hungarian (Attila is the most popular); Attila, Atilla, Atilay, or Atila in Turkish; and Adil and Edil in Kazakh or Adil (&quot;same/similar&quot;) or Edil (&quot;to use&quot;) in Mongolian.

=== Attila and Hun tradition in the medieval Hungarian Royal Court ===

The basic premise of the Hungarian medieval chronicle tradition that the Huns, i.e. the Hungarians coming out twice from Scythia, the guiding principle of the chronicles was the Hun-Hungarian continuity. The Hungarian state founder royal dynasty, the Árpád dynasty claimed to be a direct descendant of the great Hun leader Attila. Medieval Hungarian chronicles claimed that Grand Prince Árpád of Hungary was the descendant of Attila.

Árpád, Grand Prince of the Hungarians says in the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot;:

King Matthias of Hungary (1458–1490) was happy to be described as &quot;the second Attila&quot;. The &quot;Chronica Hungarorum&quot; by Johannes Thuróczy set the goal of glorifying Attila, which was undeservedly neglected, moreover, he introduced the famous &quot;Scourge of God&quot; characterization to the later Hungarian writers, because the earlier chronicles remained hidden for a long time. Thuróczy worked hard to endear Attila, the Hun king with an effort far surpassing his predecessor chroniclers. He made Attila a model for his victorious ruler, King Matthias of Hungary who had Attila&#x27;s abilities, with this he almost brought &quot;the hammer of the world&quot; to life.

=== Legends about Attila and the sword of Mars ===
Jordanes embellished the report of Priscus, reporting that Attila had possessed the &quot;Holy War Sword of the Scythians&quot;, which was given to him by Mars and made him a &quot;prince of the entire world&quot;.

Lampert of Hersfeld&#x27;s contemporary chronicles report that shortly before the year 1071, the Sword of Attila had been presented to Otto of Nordheim by the exiled queen of Hungary, Anastasia of Kiev. This sword, a cavalry sabre now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, appears to be the work of Hungarian goldsmiths of the ninth or tenth century.

=== Legends about Attila and his meeting with Pope Leo I ===

An anonymous chronicler of the medieval period represented the meeting of Pope Leo and Atilla as attended also by Saint Peter and Saint Paul, &quot;a miraculous tale calculated to meet the taste of the time&quot; This apotheosis was later portrayed artistically by the Renaissance artist Raphael and sculptor Algardi, whom eighteenth-century historian Edward Gibbon praised for establishing &quot;one of the noblest legends of ecclesiastical tradition&quot;.

According to a version of this narrative related in the &quot;Chronicon Pictum&quot;, a mediaeval Hungarian chronicle, the Pope promised Attila that if he left Rome in peace, one of his successors would receive a holy crown (which has been understood as referring to the Holy Crown of Hungary).

=== Attila in Germanic heroic legend ===
Some histories and chronicles describe Attila as a great and noble king, and he plays major roles in three Norse texts: &quot;Atlakviða&quot;, &quot;Volsunga saga&quot;, and &quot;Atlamál&quot;. The &quot;Polish Chronicle&quot; represents Attila&#x27;s name as &quot;Aquila&quot;.

Frutolf of Michelsberg and Otto of Freising pointed out that some songs as &quot;vulgar fables&quot; and made Theoderic the Great, Attila and Ermanaric contemporaries, when any reader of Jordanes knew that this was not the case. This refers to the so-called historical poems about Dietrich von Bern (Theoderic), in which Etzel (German for Attila) is Dietrich&#x27;s refuge in exile from his wicked uncle Ermenrich (Ermanaric). Etzel is most prominent in the poems &quot;Dietrichs Flucht&quot; and the &quot;Rabenschlacht&quot;. Etzel also appears as Kriemhild&#x27;s second noble husband in the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;, in which Kriemhild causes the destruction of both the Hunnish kingdom and that of her Burgundian relatives.

=== Early modern and modern reception ===

In 1812, Ludwig van Beethoven conceived the idea of writing an opera about Attila and approached August von Kotzebue to write the libretto. It was, however, never written. In 1846, Giuseppe Verdi wrote the opera, loosely based on episodes in Attila&#x27;s invasion of Italy.

In World War I, Allied propaganda referred to Germans as the &quot;Huns&quot;, based on a 1900 speech by Emperor Wilhelm II praising Attila the Hun&#x27;s military prowess, according to Jawaharlal Nehru&#x27;s &quot;Glimpses of World History&quot;. &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; commented on 6 November 1948, that the Sword of Attila was hanging menacingly over Austria.

American writer Cecelia Holland wrote &quot;The Death of Attila&quot; (1973), a historical novel in which Attila appears as a powerful background figure whose life and death deeply affect the protagonists, a young Hunnic warrior and a Germanic one.

In modern Hungary and in Turkey, &quot;Attila&quot; and its Turkish variation &quot;Atilla&quot; are commonly used as a male first name. In Hungary, several public places are named after Attila; for instance, in Budapest there are 10 Attila Streets, one of which is an important street behind the Buda Castle. When the Turkish Armed Forces invaded Cyprus in 1974, the operations were named after Attila (&quot;The Attila Plan&quot;).

The 1954 Universal International film &quot;Sign of the Pagan&quot; starred Jack Palance as Attila.

<doc id="842" wikidata="Q34575" url="?curid=842" title="Aegean Sea">
<text>The Aegean Sea is an elongated embayment of the Mediterranean Sea between Europe and Asia. It is located between the Balkans and Anatolia, and covers an area of some . In the north, the Aegean is connected to the Marmara Sea, which in turn connects to the Black Sea, by the straits of the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus, respectively. The Aegean Islands are located within the sea and some bound it on its southern periphery, including Crete and Rhodes. The sea reaches a maximum depth of 2,639 m (8,658 ft) to the west of Karpathos. The Thracian Sea and the Sea of Crete are main subdivisions of the Aegean Sea.

The Aegean Islands can be divided into several island groups, including the Dodecanese, the Cyclades, the Sporades, the Saronic islands and the North Aegean Islands, as well as Crete and its surrounding islands. The Dodecanese, located to the southeast, includes the islands of Rhodes, Kos, and Patmos; the islands of Delos and Naxos are within the Cyclades to the south of the sea. Lesbos is part of the North Aegean Islands. Euboea, the second-largest island in Greece, is located in the Aegean, despite being administered as part of Central Greece. Nine out of twelve of the Administrative regions of Greece border the sea, along with the Turkish provinces of Edirne, Çanakkale, Balıkesir, İzmir, Aydın and Muğla to the east of the sea. Various Turkish islands in the sea are Imbros, Tenedos, Cunda Island, and the Foça Islands.

The Aegean Sea has been historically important, especially regarding the civilization of Ancient Greece, which inhabited the area around the coast of the Aegean and the Aegean islands. The Aegean islands facilitated contact between the people of the area and between Europe and Asia. Along with the Greeks, Thracians lived along the northern coasts. The Romans conquered the area under the Roman Empire, and later the Byzantine Empire held it against advances by the First Bulgarian Empire. The Fourth Crusade weakened Byzantine control of the area, and it was eventually conquered by the Ottoman Empire, with the exception of Crete, which was a Venetian colony until 1669. The Greek War of Independence allowed a Greek state on the coast of the Aegean from 1829 onwards. The Ottoman Empire held a presence over the sea for over 500 years until it was replaced by modern Turkey.

The rocks making up the floor of the Aegean are mainly limestone, though often greatly altered by volcanic activity that has convulsed the region in relatively recent geologic times. Of particular interest are the richly colored sediments in the region of the islands of Santorini and Milos, in the south Aegean. Notable cities on the Aegean coastline include Athens, Thessaloniki, Volos, Kavala, and Heraklion in Greece, and İzmir and Bodrum in Turkey.

Several issues concerning sovereignty within the Aegean Sea are disputed between Greece and Turkey. The Aegean dispute has had a large effect on Greece-Turkey relations since the 1970s. Issues include the delimitation of territorial waters, national airspace, exclusive economic zones, and flight information regions.

==Name and etymology==
The name &quot;Aegaeus&quot;, used by Late Latin authors, referred to Aegeus, who was said to have jumped into that sea to drown himself (rather than throw himself from the Athenian acropolis, as told by some Greek authors). He was the father of Theseus, the mythical king and founder-hero of Athens. Aegeus had told Theseus to put up white sails when returning if he was successful in killing the Minotaur. When Theseus returned, he forgot these instructions, and Aegeus thought his son had died, so he drowned himself in the sea.

The sea was known in Latin as &quot;Mare Aegaeum&quot; while under the control of the Roman Empire. The Venetians, who ruled many Greek islands in the High and Late Middle Ages, popularized the name &quot;Archipelago&quot; (, meaning &quot;main sea&quot; or &quot;chief sea&quot;), a name that held on in many European countries until the early modern period. In South Slavic languages, the Aegean is called &quot;White Sea&quot; (; ; ). The Turkish name for the sea is &quot;Ege Denizi&quot;, which is derived from the Greek name, and &quot;Adalar Denizi&quot; meaning &quot;Sea of Islands&quot;.

==Geography==
The Aegean Sea is an elongated embayment of the Mediterranean Sea and covers about in area, measuring about longitudinally and latitudinal. The sea&#x27;s maximum depth is , located at a point west of Karpathos. The Aegean Islands are found within its waters, with the following islands delimiting the sea on the south, generally from west to east: Kythera, Antikythera, Crete, Kasos, Karpathos and Rhodes. The Anatolian peninsula marks the eastern boundary of the sea, while the Greek mainland marks the west. Several seas are contained within the Aegean Sea; the Thracian Sea is a section of the Aegean located to the north, the Icarian Sea to the east, the Myrtoan Sea to the west, while the Sea of Crete is the southern section.

The Greek regions that border the sea, in alphabetical order, are Attica, Central Greece, Central Macedonia, Crete, Eastern Macedonia and Thrace, North Aegean, Peloponnese, South Aegean, and Thessaly. The traditional Greek region of Macedonia also borders the sea, to the north.

The Aegean Islands, which almost all belong to Greece, can be divided into seven groups:
# Northeastern Aegean Islands, which lie in the Thracian Sea 
# East Aegean Islands (&quot;Euboea&quot;) 
# Northern Sporades
# Cyclades
# Saronic Islands (or &quot;Argo-Saronic Islands&quot;)
# Dodecanese (or &quot;Southern Sporades&quot;)
# Crete

Many of the Aegean islands or island chains, are geographical extensions of the mountains on the mainland. One chain extends across the sea to Chios, another extends across Euboea to Samos, and a third extends across the Peloponnese and Crete to Rhodes, dividing the Aegean from the Mediterranean.

The bays and gulfs of the Aegean beginning at the South and moving clockwise include on Crete, the Mirabello, Almyros, Souda and Chania bays or gulfs, on the mainland the Myrtoan Sea to the west with the Argolic Gulf, the Saronic Gulf northwestward, the Petalies Gulf which connects with the South Euboic Sea, the Pagasetic Gulf which connects with the North Euboic Sea, the Thermian Gulf northwestward, the Chalkidiki Peninsula including the Cassandra and the Singitic Gulfs, northward the Strymonian Gulf and the Gulf of Kavala and the rest are in Turkey; Saros Gulf, Edremit Gulf, Dikili Gulf, Gulf of Çandarlı, Gulf of İzmir, Gulf of Kuşadası, Gulf of Gökova, Güllük Gulf.

The Aegean Sea is connected to the Sea of Marmara by the Dardanelles, also known from Classical Antiquity as the Hellespont. The Dardanelles are located to the northeast of the sea. It ultimately connects with the Black Sea through the Bosporus strait, upon which lies the city of Istanbul. The Dardanelles and the Bosporus are known as the Turkish Straits.

===Extent===
According to the International Hydrographic Organization, the limits of the Aegean Sea as follows:

* On the south: A line running from Cape Aspro (28°16′E) in Asia Minor, to Cum Burnù (Capo della Sabbia) the Northeast extreme of the Island of Rhodes, through the island to Cape Prasonisi, the Southwest point thereof, on to Vrontos Point (35°33′N) in Skarpanto [Karpathos], through this island to Castello Point, the South extreme thereof, across to Cape Plaka (East extremity of Crete), through Crete to Agria Grabusa, the Northwest extreme thereof, thence to Cape Apolytares in Antikythera Island, through the island to Psira Rock (off the Northwest point) and across to Cape Trakhili in Kythira Island, through Kythira to the Northwest point (Cape Karavugia) and thence to Cape Santa Maria () in the Morea.
* In the Dardanelles: A line joining Kum Kale (26°11′E) and Cape Helles.

===Hydrography===
Aegean surface water circulates in a counterclockwise gyre, with hypersaline Mediterranean water moving northward along the west coast of Turkey, before being displaced by less dense Black Sea outflow. The dense Mediterranean water sinks below the Black Sea inflow to a depth of , then flows through the Dardanelles Strait and into the Sea of Marmara at velocities of . The Black Sea outflow moves westward along the northern Aegean Sea, then flows southwards along the east coast of Greece.

The physical oceanography of the Aegean Sea is controlled mainly by the regional climate, the fresh water discharge from major rivers draining southeastern Europe, and the seasonal variations in the Black Sea surface water outflow through the Dardanelles Strait.

Analysis of the Aegean during 1991 and 1992 revealed three distinct water masses:

* Aegean Sea Surface Water – thick veneer, with summer temperatures of 21–26 °C and winter temperatures ranging from in the north to in the south.
* Aegean Sea Intermediate Water – Aegean Sea Intermediate Water extends from to with temperatures ranging from .
* Aegean Sea Bottom Water – occurring at depths below with a very uniform temperature () and salinity (3.91–3.92%).

===Climate===

The climate of the Aegean Sea largely reflects the climate of Greece and Western Turkey, which is to say, predominantly Mediterranean. According to the Köppen climate classification, most of the Aegean is classified as Hot-summer Mediterranean (&quot;Csa&quot;), with hotter and drier summers along with milder and wetter winters. However, high temperatures during summers are generally not quite as high as those in arid or semiarid climates due to the presence of a large body of water. This is most predominant in the west and east coasts of the Aegean, and within the Aegean islands. In the north of the Aegean Sea, the climate is instead classified as Cold semi-arid &quot;(BSk)&quot;, which feature cooler summers than Hot-summer Mediterranean climates. The Etesian winds are a dominant weather influence in the Aegean Basin.

The below table lists climate conditions of some major Aegean cities:
===Population===
Numerous Greek and Turkish settlements are located along their mainland coast, as well as on towns on the Aegean islands. The largest cities are Athens and Thessaloniki in Greece and İzmir in Turkey. The most populated of the Aegean islands is Crete, followed by Euboea and Rhodes. 



==Biogeography and ecology==
===Protected areas===
Greece has established several marine protected areas along its coasts. According to the Network of Managers of Marine Protected Areas in the Mediterranean (MedPAN), four Greek MPAs are participating in the Network. These include Alonnisos Marine Park, while the Missolonghi–Aitoliko Lagoons and the island of Zakynthos are not on the Aegean.

==History==
===Ancient history===

The current coastline dates back to about 4000 BC. Before that time, at the peak of the last ice age (about 18,000 years ago) sea levels everywhere were lower, and there were large well-watered coastal plains instead of much of the northern Aegean. When they were first occupied, the present-day islands including Milos with its important obsidian production were probably still connected to the mainland. The present coastal arrangement appeared around 9,000 years ago, with post-ice age sea levels continuing to rise for another 3,000 years after that.

The subsequent Bronze Age civilizations of Greece and the Aegean Sea have given rise to the general term &quot;Aegean civilization&quot;. In ancient times, the sea was the birthplace of two ancient civilizations – the Minoans of Crete and the Mycenaeans of the Peloponnese.

The Minoan civilization was a Bronze Age civilization on the island of Crete and other Aegean islands, flourishing from around 3000 to 1450 BC before a period of decline, finally ending at around 1100 BC. It represented the first advanced civilization in Europe, leaving behind massive building complexes, tools, stunning artwork, writing systems, and a massive network of trade. The Minoan period saw extensive trade between Crete, Aegean, and Mediterranean settlements, particularly the Near East. The most notable Minoan palace is that of Knossos, followed by that of Phaistos. The Mycenaean Greeks arose on the mainland, becoming the first advanced civilization in mainland Greece, which lasted from approximately 1600 to 1100 BC. It is believed that the site of Mycenae, which sits close to the Aegean coast, was the center of Mycenaean civilization. The Mycenaeans introduced several innovations in the fields of engineering, architecture and military infrastructure, while trade over vast areas of the Mediterranean, including the Aegean, was essential for the Mycenaean economy. Their syllabic script, the Linear B, offers the first written records of the Greek language and their religion already included several deities that can also be found in the Olympic Pantheon. Mycenaean Greece was dominated by a warrior elite society and consisted of a network of palace-centered states that developed rigid hierarchical, political, social and economic systems. At the head of this society was the king, known as &quot;wanax&quot;.

The civilization of Mycenaean Greeks perished with the collapse of Bronze Age culture in the eastern Mediterranean, to be followed by the so-called Greek Dark Ages. It is undetermined what cause the collapse of the Mycenaeans. During the Greek Dark Ages, writing in the Linear B script ceased, vital trade links were lost, and towns and villages were abandoned.

===Ancient Greece===

The Archaic period followed the Greek Dark Ages in the 8th century BC. Greece became divided into small self-governing communities, and adopted the Phoenician alphabet, modifying it to create the Greek alphabet. By the 6th century BC several cities had emerged as dominant in Greek affairs: Athens, Sparta, Corinth, and Thebes, of which Athens, Sparta, and Corinth were closest to the Aegean Sea. Each of them had brought the surrounding rural areas and smaller towns under their control, and Athens and Corinth had become major maritime and mercantile powers as well. In the 8th and 7th centuries BC many Greeks migrated to form colonies in Magna Graecia (Southern Italy and Sicily), Asia Minor and further afield. The Aegean Sea was the setting for one of the most pivotal naval engagements in history, when, on 20 September 480 B.C., the Athenian fleet gained a decisive victory over the Persian fleet of the Xerxes II of Persia at the Battle of Salamis. Thus ending any further attempt of western expansion by the Achaemenid Empire.

The Aegean Sea would later come to be under the control, albeit briefly, of the Kingdom of Macedonia. Philip II and his son Alexander the Great led a series of conquests that led not only to the unification of the Greek mainland and the control of the Aegean Sea under his rule, but also the destruction of the Achaemenid Empire. After Alexander the Great&#x27;s death, his empire was divided among his generals. Cassander became king of the Hellenistic kingdom of Macedon, which held territory along the western coast of the Aegean, roughly corresponding to modern-day Greece. The Kingdom of Lysimachus had control over the sea&#x27;s eastern coast. Greece had entered the Hellenistic period.

===Roman rule===
The Macedonian Wars were a series of conflicts fought by the Roman Republic and its Greek allies in the eastern Mediterranean against several different major Greek kingdoms. They resulted in Roman control or influence over the eastern Mediterranean basin, including the Aegean, in addition to their hegemony in the western Mediterranean after the Punic Wars. During Roman rule, the land around the Aegean Sea fell under the provinces of Achaea, Macedonia, Thracia, Asia and Creta et Cyrenaica (island of Crete)

===Medieval period===

The fall of the Western Roman Empire allowed its successor state, the Byzantine Empire, to continue Roman control over the Aegean Sea. However, their territory would later be threatened by the early Muslim conquests initiated by Muhammad in the 7th century. Although the Rashidun Caliphate did not manage to obtain land along the coast of the Aegean Sea, its conquest of the Eastern Anatolian peninsula as well as Egypt, the Levant, and North Africa left the Byzantine Empire weakened. The Umayyad Caliphate expanded the territorial gains of the Rashidun Caliphate, conquering much of North Africa, and threatened the Byzantine Empire&#x27;s control of Western Anatolia, where it meets the Aegean Sea.

During the 820s, Crete was conquered by a group of Berbers Andalusians exiles led by Abu Hafs Umar al-Iqritishi, and it became an independent Islamic state. The Byzantine Empire launched a campaign that took most of the island back in 842 and 843 under Theoktistos, but the re-conquest was not completed and was soon reversed. Later attempts by the Byzantine Empire to recover the island were without success. For the approximately 135 years of its existence, the emirate of Crete was one of the major foes of Byzantium. Crete commanded the sea lanes of the Eastern Mediterranean and functioned as a forward base and haven for Muslim corsair fleets that ravaged the Byzantine-controlled shores of the Aegean Sea. Crete returned to Byzantine rule under Nikephoros II Phokas, who launched a huge campaign against the Emirate of Crete in 960 to 961.

Meanwhile, the Bulgarian Empire threatened Byzantine control of Northern Greece and the Aegean coast to the south. Under Presian and his successor Boris I, the Bulgarian Empire managed to obtain a small portion of the northern Aegean coast. Simeon I of Bulgaria led Bulgaria to its greatest territorial expansion, and managed to conqueror much of the northern and western coasts of the Aegean. The Byzantines later regained control. The Second Bulgarian Empire achieved similar success along, again, the northern and western coasts, under Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria.
The Seljuk Turks, under the Seljuk Empire, invaded the Byzantine Empire in 1068, from which they annexed almost all the territories of Anatolia, including the east coast of the Aegean Sea, during the reign of Alp Arslan, the second Sultan of the Seljuk Empire. After the death of his successor, Malik Shah I, the empire was divided, and Malik Shah was succeeded in Anatolia by Kilij Arslan I, who founded the Sultanate of Rum. The Byzantines yet again recaptured the eastern coast of the Aegean.

After Constantinople was occupied by Western European and Venetian forces during the Fourth Crusade, the area around the Aegean Sea was fragmented into multiple entities, including the Latin Empire, the Kingdom of Thessalonica, the Empire of Nicaea, the Principality of Achaea, and the Duchy of Athens. The Venetians created the maritime state of the Duchy of the Archipelago, which included all the Cyclades except Mykonos and Tinos. The Empire of Nicaea, a Byzantine rump state, managed to affect the Recapture of Constantinople from the Latins in 1261 and defeat Epirus. Byzantine successes were not to last; the Ottomans would conquer the area around the Aegean coast, but before their expansion the Byzantine Empire had already been weakened from internal conflict. By the late 14th century, the Byzantine Empire had lost all control of the coast of the Aegean Sea and could exercise power around their capital, Constantinople. The Ottoman Empire then gained control of all the Aegean coast with the exception of Crete, which was a Venetian colony until 1669.

===Modern Period===

The Greek War of Independence allowed a Greek state on the coast of the Aegean from 1829 onward. The Ottoman Empire held a presence over the sea for over 500 years until its dissolution following World War I, when it was replaced by modern Turkey. During the war, Greece gained control over the area around the northern coast of the Aegean. By the 1930s, Greece and Turkey had about resumed their present-day borders.

In the Italo-Turkish War of 1912, Italy captured the Dodecanese islands, and had occupied them since, reneging on the 1919 Venizelos–Tittoni agreement to cede them to Greece. The Greco-Italian War took place from October 1940 to April 1941 as part of the Balkans Campaign of World War II. The Italian war aim was to establish a Greek puppet state, which would permit the Italian annexation of the Sporades and Cyclades islands in the Aegean Sea, to be administered as a part of the Italian Aegean Islands. The German invasion resulted in the Axis occupation of Greece. The German troops evacuated Athens on 12 October 1944, and by the end of the month, they had withdrawn from mainland Greece. Greece was then liberated by Allied troops.

==Economy and politics==
Many of the islands in the Aegean have safe harbours and bays. In ancient times, navigation through the sea was easier than travelling across the rough terrain of the Greek mainland, and to some extent, the coastal areas of Anatolia. Many of the islands are volcanic, and marble and iron are mined on other islands. The larger islands have some fertile valleys and plains.

Of the main islands in the Aegean Sea, two belong to Turkey – Bozcaada (Tenedos) and Gökçeada (Imbros); the rest belong to Greece. Between the two countries, there are political disputes over several aspects of political control over the Aegean space, including the size of territorial waters, air control and the delimitation of economic rights to the continental shelf. These issues are known as the Aegean dispute.

===Transport===
Multiple ports are located along the Greek and Turkish coasts of the Aegean Sea. The port of Piraeus in Athens is the chief port in Greece, the largest passenger port in Europe and the third largest in the world, servicing about 20 million passengers annually. With a throughput of 1.4 million TEUs, Piraeus is placed among the top ten ports in container traffic in Europe and the top container port in the Eastern Mediterranean. Piraeus is also the commercial hub of Greek shipping. Piraeus bi-annually acts as the focus for a major shipping convention, known as Posidonia, which attracts maritime industry professionals from all over the world. Piraeus is currently Greece&#x27;s third-busiest port in terms of tons of goods transported, behind Agioi Theodoroi and Thessaloniki. The central port serves ferry routes to almost every island in the eastern portion of Greece, the island of Crete, the Cyclades, the Dodecanese, and much of the northern and the eastern Aegean Sea, while the western part of the port is used for cargo services.

As of 2007, the Port of Thessaloniki was the second-largest container port in Greece after the port of Piraeus, making it one of the busiest ports in Greece. In 2007, the Port of Thessaloniki handled 14,373,245 tonnes of cargo and 222,824 TEU&#x27;s. Paloukia, on the island of Salamis, is a major passenger port.

Fish are Greece&#x27;s second-largest agricultural export, and Greece has Europe&#x27;s largest fishing fleet. Fish captured include sardines, mackerel, grouper, grey mullets, sea bass, and seabream. There is a considerable difference between fish catches between the pelagic and demersal zones; with respect to pelagic fisheries, the catches from the northern, central and southern Aegean area groupings are dominated, respectively, by anchovy, horse mackerels, and boops. For demersal fisheries, the catches from the northern and southern Aegean area groupings are dominated by grey mullets and pickerel (&quot;Spicara smaris&quot;) respectively.

The industry has been impacted by the Great Recession. Overfishing and habitat destruction is also a concern, threatening grouper, and seabream populations, resulting in perhaps a 50% decline of fish catch. To address these concerns, Greek fishermen have been offered a compensation by the government. Although some species are defined as protected or threatened under EU legislation, several illegal species such as the molluscs &quot;Pinna nobilis&quot;, &quot;Charonia tritonis&quot; and &quot;Lithophaga lithophaga&quot;, can be bought in restaurants and fish markets around Greece.

===Tourism===

The Aegean islands within the Aegean Sea are significant tourist destinations. Tourism to the Aegean islands contributes a significant portion of tourism in Greece, especially since the second half of the 20th century. A total of five UNESCO World Heritage sites are located the Aegean Islands; these include the Monastery of Saint John the Theologian and the Cave of the Apocalypse on Patmos, the Pythagoreion and Heraion of Samos in Samos, the Nea Moni of Chios, the island of Delos, and the Medieval City of Rhodes.

Greece is one of the most visited countries in Europe and the world with over 33 million visitors in 2018, and the tourism industry around a quarter of Greece&#x27;s Gross Domestic Product. The islands of Santorini, Crete, Lesbos, Delos, and Mykonos are common tourist destinations. An estimated 2 million tourists visit Santorini annually. However, concerns relating to overtourism have arisen in recent years, such as issues of inadequate infrastructure and overcrowding. Alongside Greece, Turkey has also been successful in developing resort areas and attracting large number of tourists, contributing to tourism in Turkey. The phrase &quot;Blue Cruise&quot; refers to recreational voyages along the Turkish Riviera, including across the Aegean. The ancient city of Troy, a World Heritage Site, is on the Turkish coast of the Aegean.

Greece and Turkey both take part in the Blue Flag beach certification programme of the Foundation for Environmental Education. The certification is awarded for beaches and marinas meeting strict quality standards including environmental protection, water quality, safety and services criteria. As of 2015, the Blue Flag has been awarded to 395 beaches and 9 marinas in Greece. Southern Aegean beaches on the Turkish coast include Muğla, with 102 beaches awarded with the blue flag, along with İzmir and Aydın, who have 49 and 30 beaches awarded respectively.

<text>A Clockwork Orange is a dystopian satirical black comedy novel by English writer Anthony Burgess, published in March 17, 1962. It is set in a near-future society that has a youth subculture of extreme violence. The teenage protagonist, Alex, narrates his violent exploits and his experiences with state authorities intent on reforming him. The book is partially written in a Russian-influenced argot called &quot;Nadsat&quot;, which takes its name from the Russian suffix that is equivalent to &#x27;-teen&#x27; in English. According to Burgess, the novel was a &quot;&quot; written in just three weeks.

In 2005, &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; was included on &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923, and it was named by Modern Library and its readers as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. The original manuscript of the book has been kept at McMaster University&#x27;s William Ready Division of Archives and Research Collections in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada since the institution purchased the documents in 1971.
It is considered one of the most influential dystopian books.

In 2022, the novel was included on the &quot;Big Jubilee Read&quot; list of 70 books by Commonwealth authors selected to celebrate the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II.

==Plot summary==
===Part 1: Alex&#x27;s world===
Alex is a 15-year-old gang leader living in a near-future dystopian city. His friends (&quot;droogs&quot; in the novel&#x27;s Anglo-Russian slang, &quot;Nadsat&quot;) and fellow gang members are Dim, a slow-witted bruiser, who is the gang&#x27;s muscle; Georgie, an ambitious second-in-command; and Pete, who mostly plays along as the droogs indulge their taste for &quot;ultra-violence&quot; (random, violent mayhem). Characterised as a sociopath and hardened juvenile delinquent, Alex is also intelligent, quick-witted, and enjoys classical music; he is particularly fond of Beethoven, whom he calls &quot;Lovely Ludwig Van&quot;. 

The droogs sit in their favourite hangout, the Korova Milk Bar, drinking &quot;milk-plus&quot; (milk laced with the customer&#x27;s drug of choice) to prepare for a night of ultra-violence. They assault a scholar walking home from the public library; rob a shop, leaving the owner and his wife bloodied and unconscious; beat up a beggar; then scuffle with a rival gang. Joyriding through the countryside in a stolen car, they break into an isolated cottage and terrorise the young couple living there, beating the husband and gang-raping his wife. The husband is a writer working on a manuscript entitled &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, and Alex contemptuously reads out a paragraph that states the novel&#x27;s main theme before shredding the manuscript. At the Korova, Alex strikes Dim for his crude response to a woman&#x27;s singing of an operatic passage, and strains within the gang become apparent. At home in his parents&#x27; flat, Alex plays classical music at top volume, which he describes as giving him orgasmic bliss before falling asleep.

Alex feigns illness to his parents to stay out of school the next day. Following an unexpected visit from P. R. Deltoid, his &quot;post-corrective adviser&quot;, Alex visits a record store, where he meets two pre-teen girls. He invites them back to the flat, where he drugs and rapes them. That night after a nap, Alex finds his droogs in a mutinous mood, waiting downstairs in the torn-up and graffitied lobby. Georgie challenges Alex for leadership of the gang, demanding that they focus on higher-value targets in their robberies. Alex quells the rebellion by slashing Dim&#x27;s hand and fighting with Georgie, then soothes the gang by agreeing to Georgie&#x27;s plan to rob the home of a wealthy elderly woman. Alex breaks in and knocks the woman unconscious, but when he hears sirens and opens the door to flee, Dim strikes him as revenge for the earlier fight. The gang abandons Alex on the front step to be arrested by the police; while in custody, he learns that the woman has died from her injuries.

===Part 2: The Ludovico Technique===

Alex is convicted of murder and sentenced to 14 years in prison. His parents visit one day to inform him that Georgie has been killed in a botched robbery. Two years into his term, he has obtained a job in one of the prison chapels, playing music on the stereo to accompany the Sunday Christian services. After his fellow cellmates blame him for beating a troublesome cellmate to death, he is chosen to undergo an experimental behaviour modification treatment called the Ludovico Technique in exchange for having the remainder of his sentence commuted. The technique is a form of aversion therapy in which Alex is injected with nausea-inducing drugs while watching graphically violent films, eventually conditioning him to become severely ill at the mere thought of violence. As an unintended consequence, the soundtrack to one of the films, Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony, renders Alex unable to enjoy his beloved classical music as before.

The technique&#x27;s effectiveness is demonstrated to a group of VIPs, who watch as Alex collapses before a man who slaps him and abases himself before a scantily clad young woman. Although the prison chaplain accuses the state of stripping Alex of free will, the government officials on the scene are pleased with the results, and Alex is released from prison.

===Part 3: After prison===
Alex returns to his parents&#x27; flat, only to find that they are letting his room to a lodger. Now homeless, he wanders the streets and enters a public library, hoping to learn of a painless method for committing suicide. The old scholar whom Alex had assaulted in Part 1 finds him and beats him with the help of several friends. Two policemen come to Alex&#x27;s rescue, but they turn out to be Dim and Billyboy, a former rival gang leader. They take Alex outside town, brutalise him, and abandon him there. Alex collapses at the door of an isolated cottage, realising too late that it is the one he and his droogs invaded in Part 1.

The writer, F. Alexander, still lives here, but his wife has since died of what he believes to be injuries she sustained in the rape. He does not recognise Alex but gives him shelter and questions him about the conditioning he has undergone. Alexander and his colleagues, all highly critical of the government, plan to use Alex as a symbol of state brutality and thus prevent the incumbent government from being re-elected. Alex inadvertently reveals that he was the ringleader of the home invasion; he is removed from the cottage and locked in an upper-storey bedroom as a relentless barrage of classical music plays over speakers. He attempts suicide by leaping from the window.

Alex wakes up in a hospital, where he is courted by government officials, anxious to counter the bad publicity created by his suicide attempt. He is informed that F. Alexander has been &quot;put away&quot; for Alex&#x27;s protection and his own. Alex is offered a well-paying job if he agrees to side with the government once discharged. A round of tests reveals that his old violent impulses have returned, indicating that the hospital doctors have undone the effects of his conditioning. As photographers snap pictures, Alex daydreams of orgiastic violence and reflects, &quot;I was cured all right.&quot;

In the final chapter, Alex—now 18 years old and working for the nation&#x27;s musical recording archives—finds himself halfheartedly preparing for another night of crime with a new gang (Len, Rick, and Bully). After a chance encounter with Pete, who has reformed and married, Alex finds himself taking less and less pleasure in acts of senseless violence. He begins contemplating giving up crime himself to become a productive member of society and start a family of his own while reflecting on the notion that his children could end up being just as destructive as he has been, if not more so.

==Omission of the final chapter in the US==
The book has three parts, each with seven chapters. Burgess has stated that the total of 21 chapters was an intentional nod to the age of 21 being recognised as a milestone in human maturation. The 21st chapter was omitted from the editions published in the United States prior to 1986. In the introduction to the updated American text (these newer editions include the missing 21st chapter), Burgess explains that when he first brought the book to an American publisher, he was told that US audiences would never go for the final chapter, in which Alex sees the error of his ways, decides he has lost his taste for violence and resolves to turn his life around.

At the American publisher&#x27;s insistence, Burgess allowed its editors to cut the redeeming final chapter from the US version, so that the tale would end on a darker note, with Alex becoming his old, ultraviolent self again – an ending which the publisher insisted would be &quot;more realistic&quot; and appealing to a US audience. The film adaptation, directed by Stanley Kubrick, is based on the American edition of the book, and is considered to be &quot;badly flawed&quot; by Burgess. Kubrick called Chapter 21 &quot;an extra chapter&quot; and claimed that he had not read the original version until he had virtually finished the screenplay and that he had never given serious consideration to using it. In Kubrick&#x27;s opinion – as in the opinion of other readers, including the original American editor – the final chapter was unconvincing and inconsistent with the book. Kubrick&#x27;s stance was unusual when compared to the standard Hollywood practice of producing films with the familiar tropes of resolving moral messages and good triumphing over evil before the film&#x27;s end.

==Characters==
* Alex: The novel&#x27;s protagonist and leader among his droogs. He often refers to himself as &quot;Your Humble Narrator&quot;. Having coaxed two ten-year-old girls into his bedroom, Alex refers to himself as &quot;Alexander the Large&quot; while raping them; this was later the basis for Alex&#x27;s claimed surname &quot;DeLarge&quot; in the 1971 film.
* George, Georgie or Georgie Boy: Effectively Alex&#x27;s greedy second-in-command. Georgie attempts to undermine Alex&#x27;s status as leader of the gang and take over their gang as the new leader. He is later killed during a botched robbery while Alex is in prison.
* Pete: The only one who does not take particular sides when the droogs fight among themselves. He later meets and marries a girl named Georgina, renouncing his violent ways and even losing his former (Nadsat) speech patterns. A chance encounter with Pete in the final chapter influences Alex to realise that he has grown bored with violence and recognise that human energy is better expended on creation than destruction.
* Dim: An idiotic and thoroughly gormless member of the gang, persistently condescended to by Alex, but respected to some extent by his droogs for his formidable fighting abilities, his weapon of choice being a length of bike chain. He later becomes a police officer, exacting his revenge on Alex for the abuse he once suffered under his command.
* P. R. Deltoid: A criminal rehabilitation social worker assigned the task of keeping Alex on the straight and narrow. He seemingly has no clue about dealing with young people, and is devoid of empathy or understanding for his troublesome charge. Indeed, when Alex is arrested for murdering an old woman and then ferociously beaten by several police officers, Deltoid simply spits on him.
* Prison Chaplain: The character who first questions whether it is moral to turn a violent person into a behavioural automaton who can make no choice in such matters. This is the only character who is truly concerned about Alex&#x27;s welfare; he is not taken seriously by Alex, though. He is nicknamed by Alex &quot;prison charlie&quot; or &quot;chaplin&quot;, a pun on Charlie Chaplin.
* Billyboy: A rival of Alex&#x27;s. Early on in the story, Alex and his droogs battle Billyboy and his droogs, which ends abruptly when the police arrive. Later, after Alex is released from prison, Billyboy (along with Dim, who like Billyboy has become a police officer) rescues Alex from a mob, then subsequently beats him in a location out of town.
* Prison Governor: The man who decides to let Alex &quot;choose&quot; to be the first reformed by the Ludovico technique.
* The Minister of the Interior: The government high-official who determined that the Ludovico&#x27;s technique will be used to cut recidivism. He is referred to as &quot;the Minister of Interior or Inferior&quot; by Alex.
* Dr Branom: A scientist, co-developer of the Ludovico technique. He appears friendly and almost paternal towards Alex at first, before forcing him into the theatre and what Alex calls the &quot;chair of torture&quot;.
* Dr Brodsky: Branom&#x27;s colleague and co-developer of the Ludovico technique. He seems much more passive than Branom and says considerably less.
* F. Alexander: An author who was in the process of typing his magnum opus &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; when Alex and his droogs broke into his house, beat him, tore up his work and then brutally gang-raped his wife, which caused her subsequent death. He is left deeply scarred by these events and when he encounters Alex two years later, he uses him as a guinea pig in a sadistic experiment intended to prove the Ludovico technique unsound. The government imprisons him afterwards. He is given the name Frank Alexander in the film.
* Cat Woman: An indirectly named woman who blocks Alex&#x27;s gang&#x27;s entrance scheme, and threatens to shoot Alex and set her cats on him if he does not leave. After Alex breaks into her house, she fights with him, ordering her cats to join the melee, but reprimands Alex for fighting them off. She sustains a fatal blow to the head during the scuffle. She is given the name Miss Weathers in the film.

==Analysis==
===Background===
&quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; was written in Hove, then a senescent English seaside town. Burgess had arrived back in Britain after his stint abroad to see that much had changed. A youth culture had developed, based around coffee bars, pop music and teenage gangs. England was gripped by fears over juvenile delinquency. Burgess stated that the novel&#x27;s inspiration was his first wife Lynne&#x27;s beating by a gang of drunk American servicemen stationed in England during World War II. She subsequently miscarried. In its investigation of free will, the book&#x27;s target is ostensibly the concept of behaviourism, pioneered by such figures as B. F. Skinner. Burgess later stated that he wrote the book in three weeks.

===Title===
Burgess has offered several clarifications about the meaning and origin of its title:
* He had overheard the phrase &quot;as queer as a clockwork orange&quot; in a London pub in 1945 and assumed it was a Cockney expression. In &quot;Clockwork Marmalade&quot;, an essay published in the &quot;Listener&quot; in 1972, he said that he had heard the phrase several times since that occasion. He also explained the title in response to a question from William Everson on the television programme &quot;Camera Three&quot; in 1972, &quot;Well, the title has a very different meaning but only to a particular generation of London Cockneys. It&#x27;s a phrase which I heard many years ago and so fell in love with, I wanted to use it, the title of the book. But the phrase itself I did not make up. The phrase &quot;as queer as a clockwork orange&quot; is good old East London slang and it didn&#x27;t seem to me necessary to explain it. Now, obviously, I have to give it an extra meaning. I&#x27;ve implied an extra dimension. I&#x27;ve implied the junction of the organic, the lively, the sweet – in other words, life, the orange – and the mechanical, the cold, the disciplined. I&#x27;ve brought them together in this kind of oxymoron, this sour-sweet word.&quot; No other record of the expression being used before 1962 has ever appeared, with Kingsley Amis going so far as to note in his &quot;Memoirs&quot; (1991) that no trace of it appears in Eric Partridge&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of Historical Slang&quot;. However, saying &quot;as queer as ...&quot; followed by an improbable object: &quot;... a clockwork orange&quot;, or &quot;... a four-speed walking stick&quot; or &quot;... a left-handed corkscrew&quot; etc. predates Burgess&#x27;s novel. An early example, &quot;as queer as Dick&#x27;s hatband&quot;, appeared in 1796, and was alluded to in 1757.
* His second explanation was that it was a pun on the Malay word &quot;orang&quot;, meaning &quot;man&quot;. The novella contains no other Malay words or links.
* In a prefatory note to &quot;A Clockwork Orange: A Play with Music&quot;, he wrote that the title was a metaphor for &quot;an organic entity, full of juice and sweetness and agreeable odour, being turned into a mechanism&quot;.
* In his essay &quot;Clockwork Oranges&quot;, Burgess asserts that &quot;this title would be appropriate for a story about the application of Pavlovian or mechanical laws to an organism which, like a fruit, was capable of colour and sweetness&quot;.
* While addressing the reader in a letter before some editions of the book, the author says that when a man ceases to have free will, they are no longer a man. &quot;Just a clockwork orange&quot;, a shiny, appealing object, but &quot;just a toy to be wound-up by either God or the Devil, or (what is increasingly replacing both) the State.&quot;

This title alludes to the protagonist&#x27;s negative emotional responses to feelings of evil which prevent the exercise of his free will subsequent to the administration of the Ludovico Technique. To induce this conditioning, Alex is forced to watch scenes of violence on a screen that are systematically paired with negative physical stimulation. The negative physical stimulation takes the form of nausea and &quot;feelings of terror&quot;, which are caused by an emetic medicine administered just before the presentation of the films.

In its original drafts, Burgess used the working title &#x27;The Ludovico Technique,&#x27; as he himself described in the foreword in the April 1995 publication. Along with removing the 21st chapter as insisted by his publisher in the original 1962 edition, he would also change the finished product&#x27;s name to its current title.

===Use of slang===

The book, narrated by Alex, contains many words in a slang argot which Burgess invented for the book, called Nadsat. It is a mix of modified Slavic words, Cockney rhyming slang and derived Russian (like &quot;baboochka&quot;). For instance, these terms have the following meanings in Nadsat: &quot;droog&quot; (друг) = friend; &quot;moloko&quot; (молоко) = milk; &quot;gulliver&quot; (голова) = head; &quot;malchick&quot; (мальчик) or &quot;malchickiwick&quot; = boy; &quot;soomka&quot; (сумка) = sack or bag; &quot;Bog&quot; (Бог) = God; &quot;horrorshow&quot; (хорошо) = good; &quot;prestoopnick&quot; (преступник) = criminal; &quot;rooker&quot; (рука) = hand; &quot;cal&quot; (кал) = crap; &quot;veck&quot; (человек) = man or guy; &quot;litso&quot; (лицо) = face; &quot;malenky&quot; (маленький) = little; and so on. Some words Burgess invented himself or just adapted from existing languages. Compare Polari.

One of Alex&#x27;s doctors explains the language to a colleague as &quot;odd bits of old rhyming slang; a bit of gypsy talk, too. But most of the roots are Slav propaganda. Subliminal penetration.&quot; Some words are not derived from anything, but merely easy to guess, e.g. &quot;in-out, in-out&quot; or &quot;the old in-out&quot; means sexual intercourse. &quot;Cutter&quot;, however, means &quot;money&quot;, because &quot;cutter&quot; rhymes with &quot;bread-and-butter&quot;; this is rhyming slang, which is intended to be impenetrable to outsiders (especially eavesdropping policemen). Additionally, slang like &quot;appypolly loggy&quot; (&quot;apology&quot;) seems to derive from school boy slang. This reflects Alex&#x27;s age of 15.

In the first edition of the book, no key was provided, and the reader was left to interpret the meaning from the context. In his appendix to the restored edition, Burgess explained that the slang would keep the book from seeming dated, and served to muffle &quot;the raw response of pornography&quot; from the acts of violence.

The term &quot;ultraviolence&quot;, referring to excessive or unjustified violence, was coined by Burgess in the book, which includes the phrase &quot;do the ultra-violent&quot;. The term&#x27;s association with aesthetic violence has led to its use in the media.

===Banning and censorship history in the US===
The first major incident of censorship of &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; took place in 1973, when a bookseller was arrested for selling the novel (although the charges were later dropped). In 1976, &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; was removed from an Aurora, Colorado high school because of &quot;objectionable language&quot;. A year later in 1977 it was removed from high school classrooms in Westport, Massachusetts over similar concerns with &quot;objectionable&quot; language. In 1982, it was removed from two Anniston, Alabama libraries, later to be reinstated on a restricted basis. However, each of these instances came after the release of Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s popular 1971 film adaptation of &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, itself the subject of much controversy after exposing a much larger part of the populace to the themes of the novel. In 2024 the book was banned in Texas by the Katy Independent School District on the basis that the novel is &quot;adopting, supporting, or promoting gender fluidity&quot; despite also pronouncing a bullying policy that protects infringements on the rights of the student.

==Reception==
===Initial response===
&quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; review was positive, and described the book as &quot;entertaining ... even profound&quot;. Kingsley Amis in &quot;The Observer&quot; acclaimed the novel as &quot;cheerful horror&quot;, writing &quot;Mr Burgess has written a fine farrago of outrageousness, one which incidentally suggests a view of juvenile violence I can&#x27;t remember having met before&quot;. Malcolm Bradbury wrote &quot;All of Mr Burgess&#x27;s powers as a comic writer, which are considerable, have gone into the rich language of his inverted Utopia. If you can stomach the horrors, you&#x27;ll enjoy the manner&quot;. Roald Dahl called it &quot;a terrifying and marvellous book&quot;. Many reviewers praised the inventiveness of the language, but expressed unease at the violent subject matter. &quot;The Spectator&quot; praised Burgess&#x27;s &quot;extraordinary technical feat&quot; but was uncomfortable with &quot;a certain arbitrariness about the plot which is slightly irritating&quot;. &quot;New Statesman&quot; acclaimed Burgess for addressing &quot;acutely and savagely the tendencies of our time&quot; but called the book &quot;a great strain to read&quot;. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; review was negative, and described the book as &quot;a very ordinary, brutal and psychologically shallow story&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; also reviewed the book negatively, describing it as &quot;a somewhat clumsy experiment with science fiction [with] clumsy cliches about juvenile delinquency&quot;. The violence was criticised as &quot;unconvincing in detail&quot;.

===Writer&#x27;s appraisal===
Burgess dismissed &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; as &quot;too didactic to be artistic&quot;. He said that the violent content of the novel &quot;nauseated&quot; him.

In 1985, Burgess published &quot;Flame into Being: The Life and Work of D. H. Lawrence&quot; and while discussing &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; in his biography, Burgess compared the notoriety of D. H. Lawrence&#x27;s novel with &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;: &quot;We all suffer from the popular desire to make the known notorious. The book I am best known for, or only known for, is a novel I am prepared to repudiate: written a quarter of a century ago, a &quot;jeu d&#x27;esprit&quot; knocked off for money in three weeks, it became known as the raw material for a film which seemed to glorify sex and violence. The film made it easy for readers of the book to misunderstand what it was about, and the misunderstanding will pursue me until I die. I should not have written the book because of this danger of misinterpretation, and the same may be said of Lawrence and &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot;.&quot;

==Adaptations==

A 1965 film by Andy Warhol entitled &quot;Vinyl&quot; was an adaptation of Burgess&#x27;s novel.

The best known adaptation of the novella is the 1971 film &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; by Stanley Kubrick, with Malcolm McDowell as Alex. In 1987, Burgess published a stage play titled &quot;A Clockwork Orange: A Play with Music&quot;. The play includes songs, written by Burgess, which are inspired by Beethoven and Nadsat slang.

A manga anthology by Osamu Tezuka entitled &quot;Tokeijikake no Ringo&quot; (Clockwork Apple) was released in 1983.

In 1988, a German adaptation of &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; at the intimate theatre of Bad Godesberg featured a musical score by the German punk rock band Die Toten Hosen which, combined with orchestral clips of Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony and &quot;other dirty melodies&quot; (so stated by the subtitle), was released on the album &quot;Ein kleines bisschen Horrorschau&quot;. The track &quot;Hier kommt Alex&quot; became one of the band&#x27;s signature songs.
In February 1990, another musical version was produced at the Barbican Theatre in London by the Royal Shakespeare Company. Titled &quot;A Clockwork Orange: 2004&quot;, it received mostly negative reviews, with John Peter of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; of London calling it &quot;only an intellectual &quot;Rocky Horror Show&quot;&quot;, and John Gross of &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; calling it &quot;a clockwork lemon&quot;. Even Burgess himself, who wrote the script based on his novel, was disappointed. According to &quot;The Evening Standard&quot;, he called the score, written by Bono and The Edge of the rock group U2, &quot;neo-wallpaper&quot;. Burgess had originally worked alongside the director of the production, Ron Daniels, and envisioned a musical score that was entirely classical. Unhappy with the decision to abandon that score, he heavily criticised the band&#x27;s experimental mix of hip-hop, liturgical, and gothic music. Lise Hand of &quot;The Irish Independent&quot; reported The Edge as saying that Burgess&#x27;s original conception was &quot;a score written by a novelist rather than a songwriter&quot;. Calling it &quot;meaningless glitz&quot;, Jane Edwardes of &quot;20/20&quot; magazine said that watching this production was &quot;like being invited to an expensive French Restaurant – and being served with a Big Mac.&quot;

In 1994, Chicago&#x27;s Steppenwolf Theater put on a production of &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; directed by Terry Kinney. The American premiere of novelist Anthony Burgess&#x27;s own adaptation of his &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; starred K. Todd Freeman as Alex. In 2001, UNI Theatre (Mississauga, Ontario) presented the Canadian premiere of the play under the direction of Terry Costa.

In 2002, Godlight Theatre Company presented the New York Premiere adaptation of &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; at Manhattan Theatre Source. The production went on to play at the SoHo Playhouse (2002), Ensemble Studio Theatre (2004), 59E59 Theaters (2005) and the Edinburgh Festival Fringe (2005). While at Edinburgh, the production received rave reviews from the press while playing to sold-out audiences. The production was directed by Godlight&#x27;s artistic director, Joe Tantalo.

In 2003, Los Angeles director Brad Mays and the ARK Theatre Company staged a multi-media adaptation of &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, which was named &quot;Pick of the Week&quot; by the &quot;LA Weekly&quot; and nominated for three of the 2004 LA Weekly Theater Awards: Direction, Revival Production (of a 20th-century work), and Leading Female Performance. Vanessa Claire Smith won Best Actress for her gender-bending portrayal of Alex, the music-loving teenage sociopath. This production utilised three separate video streams outputted to seven onstage video monitors – six 19-inch and one 40-inch. In order to preserve the first-person narrative of the book, a pre-recorded video stream of Alex, &quot;your humble narrator&quot;, was projected onto the 40-inch monitor, thereby freeing the onstage character during passages which would have been awkward or impossible to sustain in the breaking of the fourth wall.

An adaptation of the work, based on the original novel, the film and Burgess&#x27;s own stage version, was performed by the SiLo Theatre in Auckland, New Zealand in early 2007.

In 2021, the International Anthony Burgess Foundation premiered a webpage cataloging various productions of &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; from around the world.

<text>Amsterdam ( , ; ; ) is the capital and most populated city of the Netherlands. It has a population of 933,680 in June 2024 within the city proper, 1,457,018 in the urban area and 2,480,394 in the metropolitan area. Located in the Dutch province of North Holland, Amsterdam is colloquially referred to as the &quot;Venice of the North&quot;, for its large number of canals, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Amsterdam was founded at the mouth of the Amstel River, which was dammed to control flooding. Originally a small fishing village in the 12th century, Amsterdam became a major world port during the Dutch Golden Age of the 17th century, when the Netherlands was an economic powerhouse. Amsterdam was the leading centre for finance and trade, as well as a hub of secular art production. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the city expanded and new neighborhoods and suburbs were built. The city has a long tradition of openness, liberalism, and tolerance. Cycling is key to the city&#x27;s modern character, and there are numerous biking paths and lanes spread throughout.

Amsterdam&#x27;s main attractions include its historic canals; the , the state museum with Dutch Golden Age art; the Van Gogh Museum; the Dam Square, where the Royal Palace of Amsterdam and former city hall are located; the Amsterdam Museum; Stedelijk Museum, with modern art; the concert hall; the Anne Frank House; the , the ; Hortus Botanicus, NEMO, the red-light district and cannabis coffee shops. The city is known for its nightlife and festival activity, with several nightclubs among the world&#x27;s most famous. Its artistic heritage, canals, and narrow canal houses with gabled façades, well-preserved legacies of the city&#x27;s 17th-century Golden Age, have attracted millions of visitors annually.

The Amsterdam Stock Exchange, founded in 1602, is considered the oldest &quot;modern&quot; securities market stock exchange in the world. As the commercial capital of the Netherlands and one of the top financial centres in Europe, Amsterdam is considered an alpha-world city. The city is the cultural capital of the Netherlands. Many large Dutch institutions have their headquarters in the city. Many of the world&#x27;s largest companies are based here or have established their European headquarters in the city, such as technology companies Uber, Netflix, and Tesla. In 2022, Amsterdam was ranked the ninth-best city to live in by the Economist Intelligence Unit and 12th on quality of living for environment and infrastructure by Mercer. The city was ranked 4th place globally as a top tech hub in 2019. The Port of Amsterdam is the fifth largest in Europe. The KLM hub and Amsterdam&#x27;s main airport, Schiphol, is the busiest airport in the Netherlands, third in Europe, and 11th in the world. The Dutch capital is one of the most multicultural cities in the world, with about 180 nationalities represented. Immigration and ethnic segregation in Amsterdam is a current issue.

Amsterdam&#x27;s notable residents throughout its history include painters Rembrandt and Vincent van Gogh, 17th-century philosophers Baruch Spinoza, John Locke, René Descartes, and the Holocaust victim and diarist Anne Frank.

==History==

===Prehistory===
Due to its geographical location in what used to be wet peatland, the founding of Amsterdam is later than other urban centres in the Low Countries. However, around the area of what later became Amsterdam, farmers settled as early as three millennia ago. They lived along the prehistoric IJ river and upstream of its tributary Amstel. The prehistoric IJ was a shallow and quiet stream in peatland behind beach ridges. This secluded area was able to grow into an important local settlement centre, especially in the late Bronze Age, the Iron Age and the Roman Age. Neolithic and Roman artefacts have also been found in the prehistoric Amstel bedding under Amsterdam&#x27;s Damrak and Rokin, such as shards of Bell Beaker culture pottery (2200–2000 BC) and a granite grinding stone (2700–2750 BC), but the location of these artefacts around the river banks of the Amstel probably points to the presence of a modest semi-permanent or seasonal settlement. Until water issues were controlled, a permanent settlement would not have been possible, since the river mouth and the banks of the Amstel in this period in time were too wet for permanent habitation.

===Founding===
The origins of Amsterdam are linked to the development of a dam on the Amstel River called &quot;Amestelle&quot;, meaning &#x27;watery area&#x27;, from &quot;&quot; &#x27;river&#x27; + &quot;&quot; &#x27;site at a shoreline&#x27;, &#x27;river bank&#x27;. In this area, land reclamation started as early as the late 10th century. Amestelle was located along a side arm of the IJ. This sidearm took its name from the eponymous land: Amstel. Amestelle was inhabited by farmers, who lived more inland and more upstream, where the land was not as wet as at the banks of the downstream river mouth. These farmers were starting the reclamation around upstream Ouderkerk aan de Amstel, and later at the other side of the river at Amstelveen. The Van Amstel family, known in documents by this name since 1019, held the stewardship in this northwestern nook of the ecclesiastical district of the bishop of Utrecht. The family later served also under the count of Holland.

A major turning point in the development of the Amstel River mouth was the All Saint&#x27;s Flood of 1170. In an extremely short time, the shallow river IJ turned into a wide estuary, which from then on offered the Amstel an open connection to the Zuiderzee, IJssel, and waterways further afield. This made the water flow of the Amstel more active, so excess water could be drained better. With drier banks, the downstream Amstel mouth became attractive for permanent habitation. Moreover, the river had grown from an insignificant peat stream into a junction of international waterways. A settlement was built here immediately after the landscape change of 1170. Right from the start of its foundation, it focused on traffic, production, and trade; not on farming, as opposed to how communities had lived further upstream for the past 200 years and northward for thousands of years. The construction of a dam at the mouth of the Amstel, eponymously named Dam, is historically estimated to have occurred between 1264 and 1275. The settlement first appeared in a document from 1275, concerning a road toll granted by the count of Holland Floris V to the residents &quot;apud Amestelledamme&quot; &#x27;at the dam in the Amstel&#x27; or &#x27;at the dam of Amstelland&#x27;. This allowed the inhabitants of the village to travel freely through the County of Holland, paying no tolls at bridges, locks and dams. This was a move in a years-long struggle for power in the area between the count of Holland and the Amstel family who governed the area on behalf of the bishop of Utrecht. By 1327, the name had developed into &quot;Aemsterdam&quot;.

===Middle Ages===
The bishop of Utrecht granted Amsterdam zone rights in either 1300 or 1306. The in 1345 rendered the city an important place of pilgrimage. During the heyday of the &quot;Stille Omgang&quot;, which became the expression of the pilgrimage after the Protestant Reformation, up to 90,000 pilgrims came to Amsterdam.

From the 14th century on, Amsterdam flourished, largely from trade with the Hanseatic League. From the 15th century on the city established an independent trade route with the Baltic Sea in grain and timber, cutting out the Hanseatic League as middlemen. The city became the staple market of Europe for bulk cargo. This was made possible due to innovations in the herring fishery, from which Amsterdam reaped great wealth. Herring had demand in markets all around Europe. Inventions of on-board gibbing and the haringbuis in 1415, made longer voyages feasible and hence enabled Dutch fishermen to follow the herring shoals far from the coasts, giving them a monopoly in the industry.

The herring industry relied on international trade cooperation and large initial investments in ships. This required many highly skilled and unskilled workers to cooperate, as well as the import of the necessary raw materials to turn an unfinished product into a marketable one. This required merchants to then sell it throughout the continent and bookkeepers and accountants to divide the profit. In short, the herring industry was setting up the foundations for what would later become the transcontinental trade system and the Dutch Golden Age, with Amsterdam at its centre, hence the saying &quot;Amsterdam is built on Herringbones&quot;.

===Conflict with Spain===

The Low Countries were part of the Hapsburg inheritance and came under the Spanish monarchy in the early sixteenth century. The Dutch rebelled against Philip II of Spain, who led a defense of Catholicism during the Protestant Reformation. The main reasons for the uprising were the imposition of new taxes, the tenth penny, and the religious persecution of Protestants by the newly introduced Inquisition. The revolt escalated into the Eighty Years&#x27; War, which ultimately led to Dutch independence. Strongly pushed by Dutch Revolt leader William the Silent, the Dutch Republic became known for its relative religious tolerance. Jews from the Iberian Peninsula, Protestant Huguenots from France, prosperous merchants, and printers from Flanders, and economic and religious refugees from the Spanish-controlled parts of the Low Countries found safety in Amsterdam. The influx of Flemish printers and the city&#x27;s intellectual tolerance made Amsterdam a centre for the European free press.

=== Centre of the Dutch Golden Age ===
During the 17th century, Amsterdam experienced what is considered its &quot;Golden Age&quot;, during which it became the wealthiest city in the Western world. Ships sailed from Amsterdam to the Baltic Sea, the Caribbean, North America, and Africa, as well as present-day Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka, and Brazil, forming the basis of a worldwide trading network. Amsterdam&#x27;s merchants had the largest share in both the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and the Dutch West India Company. These companies acquired overseas possessions that later became Dutch colonies.

Amsterdam was Europe&#x27;s most important hub for the shipment of goods and was the leading financial centre of the Western world. In 1602, the Amsterdam office of the Dutch East India Company became the world&#x27;s first stock exchange by trading in its own shares. The Bank of Amsterdam started operations in 1609, acting as a full-service bank for Dutch merchant bankers and as a reserve bank.

From the 17th century onwards, Amsterdam also became involved in the Atlantic slave trade. The city was a major destination port for Dutch slave ships participating in the triangular trade, which lasted until the United Netherlands abolished the Netherlands&#x27; involvement in the trade in 1814 at the request of the British government. Amsterdam was also a member of the Society of Suriname, an organisation founded to oversee the management of the Dutch colony of Surinam, which was economically dependent on slave plantations. On 1 July 2021, the mayor of Amsterdam, Femke Halsema, apologised for the city&#x27;s involvement in the slave trade.

=== Decline and modernization ===
Amsterdam&#x27;s prosperity declined during the 18th and early 19th centuries. The wars of the Dutch Republic with England (latterly, Great Britain) and France took their toll on the city. During the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars, Amsterdam&#x27;s significance reached its lowest point, with Holland being absorbed into the French Empire. However, the later establishment of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1815 marked a turning point.
The end of the 19th century is sometimes called Amsterdam&#x27;s second Golden Age. New museums, a railway station, and the were built; At the same time, the Industrial Revolution reached the city. The Amsterdam–Rhine Canal was dug to give Amsterdam a direct connection to the Rhine, and the North Sea Canal was dug to give the port a shorter connection to the North Sea. Both projects dramatically improved commerce with the rest of Europe and the world. In 1906, Joseph Conrad gave a brief description of Amsterdam as seen from the seaside, in &quot;The Mirror of the Sea&quot;.

===20th century – present===

Shortly before the First World War, the city started to expand again, and new suburbs were built. Even though the Netherlands remained neutral in this war, Amsterdam suffered a food shortage, and heating fuel became scarce. The shortages sparked riots in which several people were killed. These riots are known as the &quot;Aardappeloproer&quot; (Potato Rebellion). People started looting stores and warehouses to get supplies, mainly food.
On 1 January 1921, after a flood in 1916, the depleted municipalities of Durgerdam, Holysloot, Zunderdorp and Schellingwoude, all lying north of Amsterdam, were, at their own request, annexed to the city. Between the wars, the city continued to expand, most notably to the west of the Jordaan district in the Frederik Hendrikbuurt and surrounding neighbourhoods.

Nazi Germany invaded the Netherlands on 10 May 1940 and took control of the country. Some Amsterdam citizens sheltered Jews, thereby exposing themselves and their families to a high risk of being imprisoned or sent to concentration camps. More than 100,000 Dutch Jews were deported to Nazi concentration camps, of whom some 60,000 lived in Amsterdam. In response, the Dutch Communist Party organized the February strike attended by 300,000 people to protest against the raids. The most famous deportee was the young Jewish girl Anne Frank, who died in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. At the end of the Second World War, communication with the rest of the country broke down, and food and fuel became scarce. Many citizens traveled to the countryside to forage. Dogs, cats, raw sugar beets, and tulip bulbs—cooked to a pulp—were consumed to stay alive. Many trees in Amsterdam were cut down for fuel, and wood was taken from the houses, apartments and other buildings of deported Jews. The city was finally liberated by Canadian forces on 5 May 1945, shortly before the end of the war in Europe.
Many new suburbs, such as Osdorp, Slotervaart, Slotermeer and Geuzenveld, were built in the years after the Second World War. These suburbs contained many public parks and wide-open spaces, and the new buildings provided improved housing conditions with larger and brighter rooms, gardens, and balconies. Because of the war and other events of the 20th century, almost the entire city centre had fallen into disrepair. As society was changing, politicians and other influential figures made plans to redesign large parts of it. There was an increasing demand for office buildings, and also for new roads, as the automobile became available to most people. A metro started operating in 1977 between the new suburb of Bijlmermeer in the city&#x27;s Zuidoost (southeast) exclave and the centre of Amsterdam. Further plans were to build a new highway above the metro to connect Amsterdam Centraal and the city centre with other parts of the city.

The required large-scale demolitions began in Amsterdam&#x27;s former Jewish neighborhood. Smaller streets, such as the Jodenbreestraat and Weesperstraat, were widened and almost all houses and buildings were demolished. At the peak of the demolition, the &quot;Nieuwmarktrellen&quot; (Nieuwmarkt riots) broke out; the rioters expressed their fury about the demolition caused by the restructuring of the city.

As a result, the demolition was stopped and the highway into the city&#x27;s centre was never fully built; only the metro was completed. Only a few streets remained widened. The new city hall was built on the almost completely demolished Waterlooplein. Meanwhile, large private organizations, such as &quot;Stadsherstel Amsterdam&quot;, were founded to restore the entire city centre. Although the success of this struggle is visible today, efforts for further restoration are still ongoing. The entire city centre has reattained its former splendour and, as a whole, is now a protected area. Many of its buildings have become monuments, and in July 2010 the Grachtengordel (the three concentric canals: Herengracht, Keizersgracht, and Prinsengracht) was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.
In the 21st century, the Amsterdam city centre has attracted large numbers of tourists: between 2012 and 2015, the annual number of visitors rose from 10 to 17 million. Real estate prices have surged, and local shops are making way for tourist-oriented ones, making the centre unaffordable for the city&#x27;s inhabitants. These developments have evoked comparisons with Venice, a city thought to be overwhelmed by the tourist influx.

Construction of a new metro line connecting the part of the city north of the IJ to its southern part was started in 2003. The project was controversial because its cost had exceeded its budget by a factor of three by 2008, because of fears of damage to buildings in the centre, and because construction had to be halted and restarted multiple times. The new metro line was completed in 2018.

Since 2014, renewed focus has been given to urban regeneration and renewal, especially in areas directly bordering the city centre, such as Frederik Hendrikbuurt. This urban renewal and expansion of the traditional centre of the city—with the construction of artificial islands of the new eastern IJburg neighbourhood—is part of the Structural Vision Amsterdam 2040 initiative.

==Geography==

Amsterdam is located in the Western Netherlands, in the province of North Holland, the capital of which is not Amsterdam, but rather Haarlem. The river Amstel ends in the city centre and connects to a large number of canals that eventually terminate in the IJ. Amsterdam&#x27;s elevation is about below sea level. The surrounding land is flat as it is formed of large polders. An artificial forest, Amsterdamse Bos, is in the southwest. Amsterdam is connected to the North Sea through the long North Sea Canal.

Amsterdam is intensely urbanised, as is the Amsterdam metropolitan area surrounding the city. Comprising of land, the city proper has 4,457 inhabitants per km2 and 2,275 houses per km2. Parks and nature reserves make up 12% of Amsterdam&#x27;s land area.

===Water===
Amsterdam has more than of canals, most of which are navigable by boat. The city&#x27;s three main canals are the Prinsengracht, the Herengracht, and the Keizersgracht.

In the Middle Ages, Amsterdam was surrounded by a moat, called the Singel, which now forms the innermost ring in the city, and gives the city centre a horseshoe shape. The city is also served by a seaport. It has been compared with Venice, due to its division into about 90 islands, which are linked by more than 1,200 bridges.

=== Climate ===

Amsterdam has an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;) strongly influenced by its proximity to the North Sea to the west, with prevailing westerly winds.

Amsterdam, as well as most of the North Holland province, lies in USDA Hardiness zone 8b. Frosts mainly occur during spells of easterly or northeasterly winds from the inner European continent. Even then, because Amsterdam is surrounded on three sides by large bodies of water, as well as having a significant heat-island effect, nights rarely fall below , while it could easily be in Hilversum, southeast.

Summers are moderately warm with several hot and humid days with occasional rain every month. The average daily high in August is , and or higher is only measured on average on 2.5 days, placing Amsterdam in AHS Heat Zone 2. The record extremes range from to . 
Days with more than of precipitation are common, on average 133 days per year.

Amsterdam&#x27;s average annual precipitation is . A large part of this precipitation falls as light rain or brief showers. Cloudy and damp days are common during the cooler months of October through March.

==Demographics==
===Historical population===

In 1300, Amsterdam&#x27;s population was around 1,000 people. While many towns in Holland experienced population decline during the 15th and 16th centuries, Amsterdam&#x27;s population grew, mainly due to the rise of the profitable Baltic maritime trade especially in grain after the Burgundian victory in the Dutch–Hanseatic War in 1441. The population of Amsterdam was only modest compared to the towns and cities of Flanders and Brabant, which comprised the most urbanized area of the Low Countries.
This changed when, during the Dutch Revolt, many people from the Southern Netherlands fled to the North, especially after Antwerp fell to Spanish forces in 1585. Jews from Spain, Portugal, and Eastern Europe similarly settled in Amsterdam, as did Germans and Scandinavians. In thirty years, Amsterdam&#x27;s population more than doubled between 1585 and 1610. By 1600, its population was around 50,000. During the 1660s, Amsterdam&#x27;s population reached 200,000. The city&#x27;s growth levelled off and the population stabilized around 240,000 for most of the 18th century.

In 1750, Amsterdam was the fourth largest city in Western Europe, behind London (676,000), Paris (560,000) and Naples (324,000). This was all the more remarkable as Amsterdam was neither the capital city nor the seat of government of the Dutch Republic, which itself was a much smaller state than Great Britain, France or the Ottoman Empire. In contrast to those other metropolises, Amsterdam was also surrounded by large towns such as Leiden (about 67,000), Rotterdam (45,000), Haarlem (38,000), and Utrecht (30,000).

The city&#x27;s population declined in the early 19th century, dipping under 200,000 in 1820. By the second half of the 19th century, industrialization spurred renewed growth. Amsterdam&#x27;s population hit an all-time high of 872,000 in 1959, before declining in the following decades due to government-sponsored suburbanisation to so-called &quot;groeikernen&quot; (growth centres) such as Purmerend and Almere. Between 1970 and 1980, Amsterdam experienced a sharp population decline, peaking at a net loss of 25,000 people in 1973. By 1985 the city had only 675,570 residents. This was soon followed by reurbanization and gentrification, leading to renewed population growth in the 2010s. Also in the 2010s, much of Amsterdam&#x27;s population growth was due to immigration to the city.

===Diversity and immigration===

In the 16th and 17th centuries, non-Dutch immigrants to Amsterdam were mostly Protestant Huguenots and Flemings, Sephardic Jews, and Westphalians. Huguenots came after the Edict of Fontainebleau in 1685, while the Flemish Protestants came during the Eighty Years&#x27; War against Catholic Spain. The Westphalians came to Amsterdam mostly for economic reasons; their influx continued through the 18th and 19th centuries. Before the Second World War, 10% of the city population was Jewish. Just twenty percent of them survived the Holocaust.

Amsterdam experienced an influx of religions and cultures after the Second World War. With 180 different nationalities, Amsterdam is home to one of the widest varieties of nationalities of any city in the world. The proportion of the population of immigrant origin in the city proper is about 50% and 88% of the population are Dutch citizens.

The first mass immigration in the 20th century was by people from Indonesia, who came to Amsterdam after the independence of the Dutch East Indies in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1960s guest workers from Turkey, Morocco, Italy, and Spain immigrated to Amsterdam. After the independence of Suriname in 1975, a large wave of Surinamese settled in Amsterdam, mostly in the Bijlmer area. Other immigrants, including refugees asylum seekers and undocumented immigrants, came from Europe, the Americas, Asia, and Africa. In the 1970s and 1980s, many &#x27;old&#x27; Amsterdammers moved to &#x27;new&#x27; cities like Almere and Purmerend, prompted by the third Land-use planning bill of the Dutch Government. This bill promoted suburbanization and arranged for new developments in so-called &quot;groeikernen&quot;, literally &quot;cores of growth&quot;. Young professionals and artists moved into neighborhoods De Pijp and the Jordaan abandoned by these Amsterdammers. The non-Western immigrants settled mostly in the social housing projects in Amsterdam-West and the Bijlmer. 

In 2006, people of non-Western origin made up approximately one-fifth of the population of Amsterdam, and more than 30% of the city&#x27;s children. A slight majority of the residents of Amsterdam have at least one parent who was born outside the country. However, a much larger majority has at least one parent who was born inside the country (intercultural marriages are common in the city). Only a third of inhabitants under 15 are &quot;autochthons (&quot;person with two parents of Dutch origin). In 2023, &quot;autochthons&quot; were a minority in 40% of Amsterdam&#x27;s neighborhoods. Segregation along ethnic lines is visible, with people of non-Western origin, considered a separate group by Statistics Netherlands, concentrating in specific neighborhoods especially in Nieuw-West, Zeeburg, Bijlmer and in certain areas of Amsterdam-Noord.

In 2000, Christians formed the largest religious group in the city (28% of the population). The next largest religion was Islam (8%), most of whose followers were Sunni. In 2015, Christians formed the largest religious group in the city (28% of the population). The next largest religion was Islam (7.1%), most of whose followers were Sunni. Amsterdam has been one of the municipalities in the Netherlands that provided immigrants with extensive and free Dutch-language courses, which have benefited many immigrants.
===Religion===

In 1578, the largely Catholic city of Amsterdam joined the revolt against Spanish rule, late in comparison to other major northern Dutch cities. Catholic priests were driven out of the city. Following the Dutch takeover, all churches were converted to Protestant worship. Calvinism was declared the main religion. It was forbidden to openly profess Roman Catholicism and the Catholic hierarchy was prohibited until the mid-19th century. This led to the establishment of clandestine churches, covert religious buildings hidden in pre-existing buildings. Catholics, some Jews, and dissenting Protestants worshipped in such buildings. A large influx of foreigners of many religions came to 17th-century Amsterdam, in particular Sefardic Jews from Spain and Portugal, Huguenots from France, Lutherans, Mennonites, as well as Protestants from across the Netherlands. This led to the establishment of many non-Dutch-speaking churches. In 1603, the Jewish received permission to practice their religion in the city. In 1639, the first synagogue was consecrated. The Jews came to call the town &quot;Jerusalem of the West&quot;.

As they became established in the city, other Christian denominations used converted Catholic chapels to conduct their own services. The oldest English-language church congregation in the world outside the United Kingdom is found at the Begijnhof. Regular services there are still offered in English under the auspices of the Church of Scotland. Being Calvinists, the Huguenots soon integrated into the Dutch Reformed Church, though often retaining their own congregations. Some, commonly referred to by the moniker &#x27;Walloon&#x27;, are recognizable today as they offer occasional services in French.

In the second half of the 17th century, Amsterdam experienced an influx of Ashkenazim, Jews from Central and Eastern Europe. Jews often fled the pogroms in those areas. The first Ashkenazis who arrived in Amsterdam were refugees from the Khmelnytsky uprising occurring in Ukraine and the Thirty Years&#x27; War, which devastated much of Central Europe. They not only founded their own synagogues but had a strong influence on the &#x27;Amsterdam dialect&#x27; adding a large Yiddish local vocabulary. Despite an absence of an official Jewish ghetto, most Jews preferred to live in the eastern part, which used to be the centre of medieval Amsterdam. The main street of this Jewish neighbourhood was Jodenbreestraat. The neighbourhood comprised the Waterlooplein and the Nieuwmarkt. Buildings in this neighbourhood fell into disrepair after the Second World War a large section of the neighbourhood was demolished during the construction of the metro system. This led to riots, and as a result, the original plans for large-scale reconstruction were abandoned by the government. The neighbourhood was rebuilt with smaller-scale residence buildings based on its original layout.
Catholic churches in Amsterdam have been constructed since the restoration of the episcopal hierarchy in 1853. One of the principal architects behind the city&#x27;s Catholic churches, Cuypers, was also responsible for the Amsterdam Centraal station and the .

In 1924, the Catholic Church hosted the International Eucharistic Congress in Amsterdam; numerous Catholic prelates visited the city, where festivities were held in churches and stadiums. Catholic processions on the public streets, however, were still forbidden under law at the time. Only in the 20th century was Amsterdam&#x27;s relation to Catholicism normalised, but despite its far larger population size, the episcopal see of the city was placed in the provincial town of Haarlem.

Historically, Amsterdam has been predominantly Christian. In 1900 Christians formed the largest religious group in the city (70% of the population), Dutch Reformed Church formed 45% of the city population, and the Catholic Church formed 25% of the city population. In recent times, religious demographics in Amsterdam have been changed by immigration from former colonies. Hinduism has been introduced from the Hindu diaspora from Suriname and several distinct branches of Islam have been brought from various parts of the world. Islam is now the largest non-Christian religion in Amsterdam. The large community of Ghanaian immigrants has established African churches, often in parking garages in the Bijlmer area.

==Cityscape and architecture==

Amsterdam fans out south from the Amsterdam Centraal station and Damrak, the main street off the station. The oldest area of the town is known as De Wallen (English: &quot;The Quays&quot;). It lies to the east of Damrak and contains the city&#x27;s famous red-light district. To the south of De Wallen is the old Jewish quarter of Waterlooplein.

The medieval and colonial age canals of Amsterdam, known as &quot;grachten&quot;, embraces the heart of the city where homes have interesting gables. Beyond the Grachtengordel are the former working-class areas of Jordaan and de Pijp. The Museumplein with the city&#x27;s major museums, the Vondelpark, a 19th-century park named after the Dutch writer Joost van den Vondel, as well as the Plantage neighbourhood, with the zoo, are also located outside the Grachtengordel.

Several parts of the city and the surrounding urban area are polders. This can be recognised by the suffix &quot;-meer&quot; which means &quot;lake&quot;, as in Aalsmeer, Bijlmermeer, Haarlemmermeer and Watergraafsmeer.

===Canals===
The Amsterdam canal system is the result of conscious city planning. In the early 17th century, when immigration was at a peak, a comprehensive plan was developed that was based on four concentric half-circles of canals with their ends emerging at the IJ bay. Known as the Grachtengordel, three of the canals were mostly for residential development: the Herengracht (where &quot;Heren&quot; refers to &quot;Heren Regeerders van de stad Amsterdam&quot;, ruling lords of Amsterdam, while &quot;gracht&quot; means canal, so that the name can be roughly translated as &quot;Canal of the Lords&quot;), Keizersgracht (Emperor&#x27;s Canal) and Prinsengracht (Prince&#x27;s Canal). The fourth and outermost canal is the Singelgracht, which is often not mentioned on maps because it is a collective name for all canals in the outer ring. The Singelgracht should not be confused with the oldest and innermost canal, the Singel.

The canals served for defense, water management and transport. The defenses took the form of a moat and earthen dikes, with gates at transit points, but otherwise no masonry superstructures. The original plans have been lost, so historians, such as Ed Taverne, need to speculate on the original intentions: it is thought that the considerations of the layout were purely practical and defensive rather than ornamental.

Construction started in 1613 and proceeded from west to east, across the breadth of the layout, like a gigantic windshield wiper as the historian Geert Mak calls it – and not from the centre outwards, as a popular myth has it. The canal construction in the southern sector was completed by 1656. Subsequently, the construction of residential buildings proceeded slowly. The eastern part of the concentric canal plan, covering the area between the Amstel River and the IJ Bay, has never been implemented. In the following centuries, the land was used for parks, senior citizens&#x27; homes, theatres, other public facilities, and waterways without much planning. Over the years, several canals have been filled in, becoming streets or squares, such as the Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal and the Spui.

===Expansion===
After the development of Amsterdam&#x27;s canals in the 17th century, the city did not grow beyond its borders for two centuries. During the 19th century, Samuel Sarphati devised a plan based on the grandeur of Paris and London at that time. The plan envisaged the construction of new houses, public buildings, and streets just outside the Grachtengordel. The main aim of the plan, however, was to improve public health. Although the plan did not expand the city, it did produce some of the largest public buildings to date, like the &quot;Paleis voor Volksvlijt&quot;.

Following Sarphati, civil engineers Jacobus van Niftrik and Jan Kalff designed an entire ring of 19th-century neighbourhoods surrounding the city&#x27;s centre, with the city preserving the ownership of all land outside the 17th-century limit, thus firmly controlling development. Most of these neighbourhoods became home to the working class.

In response to overcrowding, two plans were designed at the beginning of the 20th century which were very different from anything Amsterdam had ever seen before: &quot;Plan Zuid&quot; (designed by the architect Berlage) and &quot;West&quot;. These plans involved the development of new neighbourhoods consisting of housing blocks for all social classes.

After the Second World War, large new neighbourhoods were built in the western, southeastern, and northern parts of the city. These new neighbourhoods were built to relieve the city&#x27;s shortage of living space and give people affordable houses with modern conveniences. The neighbourhoods consisted mainly of large housing blocks located among green spaces, connected to wide roads, making the neighbourhoods easily accessible by motor car. The western suburbs which were built in that period are collectively called the Westelijke Tuinsteden. The area to the southeast of the city built during the same period is known as the Bijlmer.

===Architecture===

Amsterdam has a rich architectural history. The oldest building in Amsterdam is the Oude Kerk (English: Old Church), at the heart of the Wallen, consecrated in 1306. The oldest wooden building is &quot;Het Houten Huys&quot; at the Begijnhof. It was constructed around 1425 and is one of only two existing wooden buildings. It is also one of the few examples of Gothic architecture in Amsterdam. The oldest stone building in the Netherlands, The Moriaan is built in &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch.

In the 16th century, wooden buildings were razed and replaced with brick ones. During this period, many buildings were constructed in the architectural style of the Renaissance. Buildings of this period are very recognisable with their stepped gable façades, which is the common Dutch Renaissance style. Amsterdam quickly developed its own Renaissance architecture. These buildings were built according to the principles of the architect Hendrick de Keyser. One of the most striking buildings designed by Hendrick de Keyser is the Westerkerk. In the 17th century baroque architecture became very popular, as it was elsewhere in Europe. This roughly coincided with Amsterdam&#x27;s Golden Age. The leading architects of this style in Amsterdam were Jacob van Campen, Philips Vingboons and Daniel Stalpaert.

Philip Vingboons designed splendid merchants&#x27; houses throughout the city. A famous building in baroque style in Amsterdam is the Royal Palace on Dam Square. Throughout the 18th century, Amsterdam was heavily influenced by French culture. This is reflected in the architecture of that period. Around 1815, architects broke with the baroque style and started building in different neo-styles. Most Gothic style buildings date from that era and are therefore said to be built in a neo-gothic style. At the end of the 19th century, the Jugendstil or Art Nouveau style became popular and many new buildings were constructed in this architectural style. Since Amsterdam expanded rapidly during this period, new buildings adjacent to the city centre were also built in this style. The houses in the vicinity of the Museum Square in Amsterdam Oud-Zuid are an example of Jugendstil. The last style that was popular in Amsterdam before the modern era was Art Deco. Amsterdam had its own version of the style, which was called the Amsterdamse School. Whole districts were built in this style, such as the &quot;Rivierenbuurt&quot;. A notable feature of the façades of buildings designed in Amsterdamse School is that they are highly decorated and ornate, with oddly shaped windows and doors.

The old city centre is the focal point of all the architectural styles before the end of the 19th century. Jugendstil and Georgian are mostly found outside the city centre in the neighbourhoods built in the early 20th century, although there are also some striking examples of these styles in the city centre. Most historic buildings in the city centre and nearby are houses, such as the famous merchants&#x27; houses lining the canals.

===Parks and recreational areas===

Amsterdam has many parks, open spaces, and squares throughout the city. The Vondelpark, the largest park in the city, is located in the Oud-Zuid neighbourhood and is named after the 17th-century Amsterdam author Joost van den Vondel. Yearly, the park has around 10 million visitors. In the park is an open-air theatre, a playground, and several horeca facilities. In the Zuid borough, is the Beatrixpark, named after Queen Beatrix. Between Amsterdam and Amstelveen is the Amsterdamse Bos (&quot;Amsterdam Forest&quot;), the largest recreational area in Amsterdam. Annually, almost 4.5 million people visit the park, which has a size of and is approximately three times the size of Central Park. The Amstelpark in the Zuid borough houses the Rieker windmill, which dates to 1636. Other parks include the Sarphatipark in the De Pijp neighbourhood, the Oosterpark in the Oost borough and the Westerpark in the Westerpark neighbourhood. The city has three beaches: Nemo Beach, Citybeach &quot;Het stenen hoofd&quot; (Silodam), and Blijburg, all located in the Centrum borough.

The city has many open squares (&quot;plein&quot; in Dutch). The namesake of the city as the site of the original dam, Dam Square, is the main city square and has the Royal Palace and National Monument. Museumplein hosts various museums, including the , Van Gogh Museum, and Stedelijk Museum. Other squares include Rembrandtplein, Muntplein, Nieuwmarkt, Leidseplein, Spui and Waterlooplein. Also, near Amsterdam is the Nekkeveld estate conservation project.

==Economy==
Amsterdam is the financial and business capital of the Netherlands.
According to the 2007 European Cities Monitor (ECM) – an annual location survey of Europe&#x27;s leading companies carried out by global real estate consultant Cushman &amp; Wakefield – Amsterdam is one of the top European cities in which to locate an international business, ranking fifth in the survey. with the survey determining London, Paris, Frankfurt and Barcelona as the four European cities surpassing Amsterdam in this regard.

A substantial number of large corporations and banks&#x27; headquarters are located in the Amsterdam area, including: AkzoNobel, Heineken International, ING Group, ABN AMRO, TomTom, Delta Lloyd Group, Booking.com and Philips. Although many small offices remain along the historic canals, centrally based companies have increasingly relocated outside Amsterdam&#x27;s city centre. Consequently, the Zuidas (English: South Axis) has become the new financial and legal hub of Amsterdam, with the country&#x27;s five largest law firms and several subsidiaries of large consulting firms, such as Boston Consulting Group and Accenture, as well as the World Trade Centre (Amsterdam) located in the Zuidas district. In addition to the Zuidas, there are three smaller financial districts in Amsterdam:

*around Amsterdam Sloterdijk railway station. Where one can find the offices of several newspapers, such as &quot;De Telegraaf.&quot; as well as those of Deloitte, the Gemeentelijk Vervoerbedrijf (municipal public transport company), and the Dutch tax offices (&quot;Belastingdienst&quot;);
*around the Johan Cruyff Arena in Amsterdam Zuidoost, with the headquarters of ING Group;
*around the Amstel railway station in the Amsterdam-Oost district to the east of the historical city. Amsterdam&#x27;s tallest building, the Rembrandt Tower, is located here. As are the headquarters of Philips, the Dutch multinational conglomerate. Amsterdam has been a leading city to reduce the use of raw materials and has created a plan to become a circular city by 2050.

The adjoining municipality of Amstelveen is the location of KPMG International&#x27;s global headquarters. Other non-Dutch companies have chosen to settle in communities surrounding Amsterdam since they allow freehold property ownership, whereas Amsterdam retains ground rent.

The Amsterdam Stock Exchange (AEX), now part of Euronext, is the world&#x27;s oldest stock exchange and, due to Brexit, has overtaken LSE as the largest bourse in Europe. It is near Dam Square in the city centre.

===Port of Amsterdam===
The Port of Amsterdam is the fourth-largest port in Europe, the 38th largest port in the world, and the second-largest port in the Netherlands by metric tons of cargo. In 2014, the Port of Amsterdam had a cargo throughput of 97,4 million tons of cargo, which was mostly bulk cargo. Amsterdam has the biggest cruise port in the Netherlands with more than 150 cruise ships every year. In 2019, the new lock in IJmuiden opened; since then, the port has been able to grow to 125 million tonnes in capacity.

===Tourism===

Amsterdam is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Europe, receiving more than 5.34 million international visitors annually; this is excluding the 16 million day-trippers visiting the city every year. The number of visitors has been growing steadily over the past decade. This can be attributed to an increasing number of European visitors. Two-thirds of the hotels are located in the city&#x27;s centre. Hotels with four or five stars contribute 42% of the total beds available and 41% of the overnight stays in Amsterdam. The room occupation rate was 85% in 2017, up from 78% in 2006. The majority of tourists (74%) originate from Europe. The largest group of non-European visitors come from the United States, accounting for 14% of the total. Certain years have a theme in Amsterdam to attract extra tourists. For example, the year 2006 was designated &quot;Rembrandt 400&quot;, to celebrate the 400th birthday of Rembrandt van Rijn. Some hotels offer special arrangements or activities during these years. The average number of guests per year staying at the four campsites around the city ranges from 12,000 to 65,000.

In 2023, the city began running a campaign to dissuade British men between the ages of 18 and 35 from coming to the city as tourists. The ad shows young men being handcuffed by police and is part of a new campaign to clean up the city&#x27;s reputation. On 25 May 2023, in a bid to crackdown on wild tourist behaviour, the city banned weed smoking in public areas in and around the red light district.

====De Wallen (red-light district)====

De Wallen, also known as Walletjes or Rosse Buurt, is a designated area for legalised prostitution and is Amsterdam&#x27;s largest and best-known red-light district. This neighbourhood has become a famous attraction for tourists. It consists of a network of canals, streets, and alleys containing several hundred small, one-room apartments rented by sex workers who offer their services from behind a window or glass door, typically illuminated with red lights. In recent years, the city government has been closing and repurposing the famous red-light district windows to clean up the area and reduce the amount of party and sex tourism.

===Retail===
Shops in Amsterdam range from large high-end department stores such as founded in 1870 to small specialty shops. Amsterdam&#x27;s high-end shops are found in the streets P.C. Hooftstraat and &quot;Cornelis Schuytstraat&quot;, which are located in the vicinity of the Vondelpark. One of Amsterdam&#x27;s busiest high streets is the narrow, medieval Kalverstraat in the heart of the city. Other shopping areas include the &quot;Negen Straatjes&quot; and Haarlemmerdijk and Haarlemmerstraat. &quot;Negen Straatjes&quot; are nine narrow streets within the &quot;Grachtengordel&quot;, the concentric canal system of Amsterdam. The Negen Straatjes differ from other shopping districts with the presence of a large diversity of privately owned shops. The Haarlemmerstraat and Haarlemmerdijk were voted the best shopping street in the Netherlands in 2011. These streets have as the &quot;Negen Straatjes&quot; a large diversity of privately owned shops. However, as the &quot;Negen Straatjes&quot; is dominated by fashion stores, the Haarlemmerstraat and Haarlemmerdijk offer a wide variety of stores, just to name some specialties: candy and other food-related stores, lingerie, sneakers, wedding clothing, interior shops, books, Italian deli&#x27;s, racing and mountain bikes, skatewear, etc.

The city also features a large number of open-air markets such as the Albert Cuyp Market, Westerstraat-markt, Ten Katemarkt, and Dappermarkt. Some of these markets are held daily, like the Albert Cuypmarkt and the Dappermarkt. Others, like the Westerstraatmarkt, are held every week.

===Fashion===

Several fashion brands and designers are based in Amsterdam. Fashion designers include Iris van Herpen, Mart Visser, Viktor &amp; Rolf, Marlies Dekkers and Frans Molenaar. Fashion models like Yfke Sturm, Doutzen Kroes and Kim Noorda started their careers in Amsterdam. Amsterdam has its garment centre in the World Fashion Center. Fashion photographers Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin were born in Amsterdam.

==Culture==


During the later part of the 16th century, Amsterdam&#x27;s Rederijkerskamer (Chamber of rhetoric) organised contests between different Chambers in the reading of poetry and drama. In 1637, Schouwburg, the first theatre in Amsterdam was built, opening on 3 January 1638. The first ballet performances in the Netherlands were given in Schouwburg in 1642 with the &quot;Ballet of the Five Senses&quot;. In the 18th century, French theatre became popular. While Amsterdam was under the influence of German music in the 19th century there were few national opera productions; the Hollandse Opera of Amsterdam was built in 1888 for the specific purpose of promoting Dutch opera. In the 19th century, popular culture was centred on the Nes area in Amsterdam (mainly vaudeville and music-hall). An improved metronome was invented in 1812 by Dietrich Nikolaus Winkel. The (1885) and Stedelijk Museum (1895) were built and opened. In 1888, the Concertgebouworkest orchestra was established. With the 20th century came cinema, radio and television. Though most studios are located in Hilversum and Aalsmeer, Amsterdam&#x27;s influence on programming is very strong. Many people who work in the television industry live in Amsterdam. Also, the headquarters of the Dutch SBS Broadcasting Group is located in Amsterdam.

===Museums===
The most important museums of Amsterdam are located on the Museumplein (Museum Square), located at the southwestern side of the Rijksmuseum. It was created in the last quarter of the 19th century on the grounds of the former World&#x27;s fair. The northeastern part of the square is bordered by the large Rijksmuseum. In front of the Rijksmuseum on the square itself is a long, rectangular pond. This is transformed into an ice rink in winter. The northwestern part of the square is bordered by the Van Gogh Museum, House of Bols Cocktail &amp; Genever Experience and Coster Diamonds. The southwestern border of the Museum Square is the Van Baerlestraat, which is a major thoroughfare in this part of Amsterdam. The Concertgebouw is located across this street from the square. To the southeast of the square are several large houses, one of which contains the American consulate. A parking garage can be found underneath the square, as well as a supermarket. The Museumplein is covered almost entirely with a lawn, except for the northeastern part of the square which is covered with gravel. The current appearance of the square was realised in 1999 when the square was remodelled. The square itself is the most prominent site in Amsterdam for festivals and outdoor concerts, especially in the summer. Plans were made in 2008 to remodel the square again because many inhabitants of Amsterdam are not happy with its current appearance.
The possesses the largest and most important collection of classical Dutch art.
It opened in 1885. Its collection consists of nearly one million objects. The artist most associated with Amsterdam is Rembrandt, whose work, and the work of his pupils, is displayed in the Rijksmuseum. Rembrandt&#x27;s masterpiece &quot;The Night Watch&quot; is one of the top pieces of art in the museum. It also houses paintings from artists like Bartholomeus van der Helst, Johannes Vermeer, Frans Hals, Ferdinand Bol, Albert Cuyp, Jacob van Ruisdael and Paulus Potter. Aside from paintings, the collection consists of a large variety of decorative art. This ranges from Delftware to giant doll-houses from the 17th century. The architect of the gothic revival building was P.J.H. Cuypers. The museum underwent a 10-year, 375 million euro renovation starting in 2003. The full collection was reopened to the public on 13 April 2013 and the Rijksmuseum has remained the most visited museum in Amsterdam with 2.2 million visitors in 2016 and 2.16 million in 2017.

Van Gogh lived in Amsterdam for a short while and there is a museum dedicated to his work. The museum is housed in one of the few modern buildings in this area of Amsterdam. The building was designed by Gerrit Rietveld. This building is where the permanent collection is displayed. A new building was added to the museum in 1999. This building, known as the performance wing, was designed by Japanese architect Kisho Kurokawa. Its purpose is to house temporary exhibitions of the museum. Some of Van Gogh&#x27;s most famous paintings, like &quot;The Potato Eaters&quot; and &quot;Sunflowers&quot;, are in the collection. The Van Gogh museum is the second most visited museum in Amsterdam, not far behind the Rijksmuseum in terms of the number of visits, being approximately 2.1 million in 2016, for example.

Next to the Van Gogh Museum stands the Stedelijk Museum. This is Amsterdam&#x27;s most important museum of modern art. The museum is as old as the square it borders and was opened in 1895. The permanent collection consists of works of art from artists like Piet Mondrian, Karel Appel, and Kazimir Malevich. After renovations lasting several years, the museum opened in September 2012 with a new composite extension that has been called &#x27;The Bathtub&#x27; due to its resemblance to one.

Amsterdam contains many other museums throughout the city. They range from small museums such as the Verzetsmuseum (Resistance Museum), the Anne Frank House, and the Rembrandt House Museum, to the very large, like the Tropenmuseum (Museum of the Tropics), Amsterdam Museum (formerly known as Amsterdam Historical Museum), H&#x27;ART Museum and the Joods Historisch Museum (Jewish Historical Museum). The modern-styled Nemo is dedicated to child-friendly science exhibitions.

===Music===
Amsterdam&#x27;s musical culture includes a large collection of songs that treat the city nostalgically and lovingly. The 1949 song &quot;Aan de Amsterdamse grachten&quot; (&quot;On the canals of Amsterdam&quot;) was performed and recorded by many artists, including John Kraaijkamp Sr.; the best-known version is probably that by Wim Sonneveld (1962). In the 1950s Johnny Jordaan rose to fame with &quot;Geef mij maar Amsterdam&quot; (&quot;I prefer Amsterdam&quot;), which praises the city above all others (explicitly Paris); Jordaan sang especially about his own neighbourhood, the Jordaan (&quot;Bij ons in de Jordaan&quot;). Colleagues and contemporaries of Johnny include Tante Leen and Manke Nelis. Another notable Amsterdam song is &quot;Amsterdam&quot; by Jacques Brel (1964). A 2011 poll by Amsterdam newspaper &quot;Het Parool&quot; that Trio Bier&#x27;s &quot;Oude Wolf&quot; was voted &quot;Amsterdams lijflied&quot;. Notable Amsterdam bands from the modern era include the Osdorp Posse and The Ex.

AFAS Live (formerly known as the Heineken Music Hall) is a concert hall located near the Johan Cruyff Arena (known as the Amsterdam Arena until 2018). Its main purpose is to serve as a podium for pop concerts for big audiences. Many famous international artists have performed there. Two other notable venues, Paradiso and the are located near the Leidseplein. Both focus on broad programming, ranging from indie rock to hip hop, R&amp;B, and other popular genres. Other subcultural music venues are OCCII, OT301, De Nieuwe Anita, Winston Kingdom, and Zaal 100. Jazz has a strong following in Amsterdam, with the Bimhuis being the premier venue. In 2012, Ziggo Dome was opened, also near Amsterdam Arena, a state-of-the-art indoor music arena.

AFAS Live is also host to many electronic dance music festivals, alongside many other venues. Armin van Buuren and Tiesto, some of the world&#x27;s leading Trance DJs hail from the Netherlands and frequently perform in Amsterdam. Each year in October, the city hosts the Amsterdam Dance Event (ADE) which is one of the leading electronic music conferences and one of the biggest club festivals for electronic music in the world, attracting over 350,000 visitors each year. Another popular dance festival is 5daysoff, which takes place in the venues Paradiso and . In the summertime, there are several big outdoor dance parties in or nearby Amsterdam, such as Awakenings, Dance Valley, Mystery Land, Loveland, A Day at the Park, Welcome to the Future, and Valtifest.
Amsterdam has a world-class symphony orchestra, the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. Their home is the , which is across the Van Baerlestraat from the Museum Square. It is considered by critics to be a concert hall with some of the best acoustics in the world. The building contains three halls, Grote Zaal, Kleine Zaal, and Spiegelzaal. Some nine hundred concerts and other events per year take place in the Concertgebouw, for a public of over 700,000, making it one of the most-visited concert halls in the world. The opera house of Amsterdam is located adjacent to the city hall. Therefore, the two buildings combined are often called the Stopera, (a word originally coined by protesters against its very construction: &quot;Stop the Opera[-house]&quot;). This huge modern complex, opened in 1986, lies in the former Jewish neighbourhood at &quot;Waterlooplein&quot; next to the river Amstel. The &quot;Stopera&quot; is the home base of Dutch National Opera, Dutch National Ballet and the Holland Symfonia. Muziekgebouw aan &#x27;t IJ is a concert hall, which is located in the IJ near the central station. Its concerts perform mostly modern classical music. Located adjacent to it, is the &quot;Bimhuis&quot;, a concert hall for improvised and Jazz music.

===Performing arts===
Amsterdam has three main theatre buildings.

The Stadsschouwburg at the Leidseplein is the home base of Toneelgroep Amsterdam. The current building dates from 1894. Most plays are performed in the Grote Zaal (Great Hall). The normal program of events encompasses all sorts of theatrical forms. In 2009, the new hall of the Stadsschouwburg Amsterdam, Toneelgroep Amsterdam, and Melkweg opened, and the renovation of the front end of the theatre was ready.

The Dutch National Opera and Ballet (formerly known as &quot;Het Muziektheater&quot;), dating from 1986, is the principal opera house and home to Dutch National Opera and Dutch National Ballet. Royal Theatre Carré was built as a permanent circus theatre in 1887 and is currently mainly used for musicals, cabaret performances, and pop concerts.

The recently re-opened DeLaMar Theater houses more commercial plays and musicals. A new theatre has also moved into the Amsterdam scene in 2014, joining other established venues: Theater Amsterdam is located in the west part of Amsterdam, on the Danzigerkade. It is housed in a modern building with a panoramic view over the harbour. The theatre is the first-ever purpose-built venue to showcase a single play entitled ANNE, the play based on Anne Frank&#x27;s life.

On the east side of town, there is a small theatre in a converted bathhouse, the Badhuistheater. The theatre often has English programming.

The Netherlands has a tradition of cabaret or &quot;kleinkunst&quot;, which combines music, storytelling, commentary, theatre, and comedy. Cabaret dates back to the 1930s and artists like Wim Kan, Wim Sonneveld, and Toon Hermans were pioneers of this form of art in the Netherlands. In Amsterdam are the Kleinkunstacademie (English: Cabaret Academy) and Nederlied Kleinkunstkoor (English: Cabaret Choir). Contemporary popular artists are Youp van &#x27;t Hek, Freek de Jonge, Herman Finkers, Hans Teeuwen, Theo Maassen, Herman van Veen, Najib Amhali, Raoul Heertje, Jörgen Raymann, Brigitte Kaandorp and Comedytrain. The English-spoken comedy scene was established with the founding of Boom Chicago in 1993. They have their own theatre at Leidseplein.

=== Nightlife ===
Amsterdam is famous for its vibrant and diverse nightlife. Amsterdam has many &quot;cafés&quot; (bars). They range from large and modern to small and cosy. The typical &quot;Bruine Kroeg&quot; (brown &quot;café&quot;) breathes a more old-fashioned atmosphere with dimmed lights, candles, and somewhat older clientele. These brown cafés mostly offer a wide range of local and international artisanal beers. Most &quot;cafés&quot; have terraces in summertime. A common sight on the Leidseplein during summer is a square full of terraces packed with people drinking beer or wine. Many restaurants can be found in Amsterdam as well. Since Amsterdam is a multicultural city, a lot of different ethnic restaurants can be found. Restaurants range from being rather luxurious and expensive to being ordinary and affordable. Amsterdam also possesses many discothèques. The two main nightlife areas for tourists are the Leidseplein and the Rembrandtplein. The Paradiso, and Sugar Factory are cultural centres, which turn into discothèques on some nights.

===Festivals===
In 2008, there were 140 festivals and events in Amsterdam. During the same year, Amsterdam was designated as the World Book Capital for one year by UNESCO.

Famous festivals and events in Amsterdam include: &quot;Koningsdag&quot; (which was named &quot;Koninginnedag&quot; until the crowning of King Willem-Alexander in 2013) (King&#x27;s Day – Queen&#x27;s Day); the Holland Festival for the performing arts; the yearly Prinsengrachtconcert (classical concerto on the Prinsen canal) in August; the &#x27;Stille Omgang&#x27; (a silent Roman Catholic evening procession held every March); Amsterdam Gay Pride; The Cannabis Cup; and the Uitmarkt. On Koningsdag—which is held each year on 27 April—hundreds of thousands of people travel to Amsterdam to celebrate with the city&#x27;s residents. The entire city becomes overcrowded with people buying products from the &quot;free market&quot;, or visiting one of the many music concerts.
The yearly Holland Festival attracts international artists and visitors from all over Europe. Amsterdam Gay Pride is a yearly local LGBT parade of boats in Amsterdam&#x27;s canals, held on the first Saturday in August. The annual Uitmarkt is a three-day cultural event at the start of the cultural season in late August. It offers previews of many different artists, such as musicians and poets, who perform on podia.

==Sports==

Amsterdam is home of the &quot;Eredivisie&quot; football club AFC Ajax. The stadium Johan Cruyff Arena is the home of Ajax. It is located in the south-east of the city next to the new Amsterdam Bijlmer ArenA railway station. Before moving to their current location in 1996, Ajax played their regular matches in the now demolished De Meer Stadion in the eastern part of the city or in the Olympic Stadium.
In 1928, Amsterdam hosted the Summer Olympics. The Olympic Stadium built for the occasion has been completely restored and is now used for cultural and sporting events, such as the Amsterdam Marathon. In 1920, Amsterdam assisted in hosting some of the sailing events for the Summer Olympics held in neighbouring Antwerp, Belgium by hosting events at Buiten IJ. They had also made a bid to host the 1952 and 1992 Summer Olympics but lost to Helsinki and Barcelona.

The city holds the Dam to Dam Run, a race from Amsterdam to Zaandam, as well as the Amsterdam Marathon. The ice hockey team Amstel Tijgers plays in the Jaap Eden ice rink. The team competes in the Dutch Ice Hockey Premier League. Speed skating championships have been held on the 400-meter lane of this ice rink.

Amsterdam holds two American football franchises: the Amsterdam Crusaders and the Amsterdam Panthers. The Amsterdam Pirates baseball team competes in the Dutch Major League. There are three field hockey teams: Amsterdam, Pinoké, and Hurley, who play their matches around the Wagener Stadium in the nearby city of Amstelveen. The basketball team MyGuide Amsterdam competes in the Dutch premier division and play their games in the Sporthallen Zuid.

There is one rugby club in Amsterdam, which also hosts sports training classes such as RTC (Rugby Talenten Centrum or Rugby Talent Centre) and the National Rugby Stadium.

Since 1999, the city of Amsterdam honours the best sportsmen and women at the Amsterdam Sports Awards. Boxer Raymond Joval and field hockey midfielder Carole Thate were the first to receive the awards, in 1999.

Amsterdam hosted the World Gymnaestrada in 1991 and will do so again in 2023.

==Politics==
The city of Amsterdam is a municipality under the Dutch Municipalities Act. It is governed by a directly elected municipal council, a municipal executive, and a mayor. Since 1981, the municipality of Amsterdam has gradually been divided into semi-autonomous boroughs, called &quot;stadsdelen&quot; or &#x27;districts&#x27;. Over time, a total of 15 boroughs were created. In May 2010, under a major reform, the number of Amsterdam boroughs was reduced to eight: Amsterdam-Centrum covering the city centre including the canal belt, Amsterdam-Noord consisting of the neighbourhoods north of the IJ lake, Amsterdam-Oost in the east, Amsterdam-Zuid in the south, Amsterdam-West in the west, Amsterdam Nieuw-West in the far west, Amsterdam Zuidoost in the southeast, and Westpoort covering the Port of Amsterdam area.

===City government===

As with all Dutch municipalities, Amsterdam is governed by a directly elected municipal council, a municipal executive and a government appointed mayor (&quot;burgemeester&quot;). The mayor is a member of the municipal executive board but also has individual responsibilities in maintaining public order. On 27 June 2018, Femke Halsema (former member of House of Representatives for GroenLinks from 1998 to 2011) was appointed as the first woman to be Mayor of Amsterdam by the King&#x27;s Commissioner of North Holland for a six-year term after being nominated by the Amsterdam municipal council and began serving a six-year term on 12 July 2018. She replaces Eberhard van der Laan (Labour Party) who was the Mayor of Amsterdam from 2010 until his death in October 2017. After the 2014 municipal council elections, a governing majority of D66, VVD and SP was formed – the first coalition without the Labour Party since World War II. Next to the Mayor, the municipal executive consists of eight &quot;wethouders&quot; (&#x27;alderpersons&#x27;) appointed by the municipal council: four D66 alderpersons, two VVD alderpersons and two SP alderpersons.

On 18 September 2017, it was announced by Eberhard van der Laan in an open letter to Amsterdam citizens that Kajsa Ollongren would take up his office as acting Mayor of Amsterdam with immediate effect due to ill health. Ollongren was succeeded as acting Mayor by Eric van der Burg on 26 October 2017 and by Jozias van Aartsen on 4 December 2017.
Unlike most other Dutch municipalities, Amsterdam is subdivided into seven boroughs, called &quot;stadsdelen&quot; or &#x27;districts&#x27;, and the urban area of Weesp. This system was gradually implemented in the 1980s to improve local governance. The boroughs are responsible for many activities that had previously been run by the central city. In 2010, the number of Amsterdam boroughs reached fifteen. Fourteen of those had their own district council (&quot;deelraad&quot;), elected by a popular vote. The fifteenth, Westpoort, covers the harbour of Amsterdam and has very few residents. Therefore, it was governed by the central municipal council.

Under the borough system, municipal decisions are made at the borough level, except for those affairs on the whole city such as major infrastructure projects, which are the jurisdiction of the central municipal authorities. In 2010, the borough system was restructured, in which many smaller boroughs merged into larger boroughs. In 2014, under a reform of the Dutch Municipalities Act, the Amsterdam boroughs lost much of their autonomous status, as their district councils were abolished.

The municipal council of Amsterdam voted to maintain the borough system by replacing the district councils with smaller, but still directly elected district committees (&quot;bestuurscommissies&quot;). Under a municipal ordinance, the new district committees were granted responsibilities through the delegation of regulatory and executive powers by the central municipal council.
===Metropolitan area===

&quot;Amsterdam&quot; is usually understood to refer to the municipality of Amsterdam. Colloquially, some areas within the municipality, such as the town of Durgerdam, may not be considered part of Amsterdam.

Statistics Netherlands uses three other definitions of Amsterdam: metropolitan agglomeration Amsterdam (&quot;Grootstedelijke Agglomeratie Amsterdam&quot;, not to be confused with &quot;Grootstedelijk Gebied Amsterdam&quot;, a synonym of &quot;Groot Amsterdam&quot;), Greater Amsterdam (&quot;Groot Amsterdam&quot;, a COROP region) and the urban region Amsterdam (&quot;Stadsgewest Amsterdam&quot;). The Amsterdam Department for Research and Statistics uses a fourth conurbation, namely the &quot;Stadsregio Amsterdam&quot; (&#x27;City Region of Amsterdam&#x27;). The city region is similar to Greater Amsterdam but includes the municipalities of Zaanstad and Wormerland.

The smallest of these areas is the municipality of Amsterdam with a population of about 870,000 in 2021. The larger conurbation had a population of over one million. It includes the municipalities of Zaanstad, Wormerland, Oostzaan, Diemen, and Amstelveen only, as well as the municipality of Amsterdam. Greater Amsterdam includes 15 municipalities and had a population of 1,400,000 in 2021. Though much larger in area, the population of this area is only slightly larger, because the definition excludes the relatively populous municipality of Zaanstad. The largest area by population, the Amsterdam Metropolitan Area (Dutch: Metropoolregio Amsterdam), has a population of 2,33 million. It includes for instance Zaanstad, Wormerland, Muiden, Abcoude, Haarlem, Almere and Lelystad but excludes Graft-De Rijp. Amsterdam is part of the conglomerate metropolitan area Randstad, with a total population of 6,659,300 inhabitants.

Of these various metropolitan area configurations, only the &quot;Stadsregio Amsterdam&quot; (City Region of Amsterdam) has a formal governmental status. Its responsibilities include regional spatial planning and metropolitan public transport concessions.

===National capital===
Under the Dutch Constitution, Amsterdam is the capital of the Netherlands. Since the 1983 constitutional revision, the constitution mentions &quot;Amsterdam&quot; and &quot;capital&quot; in chapter 2, article 32: The king&#x27;s confirmation by oath and his coronation take place in &quot;the capital Amsterdam&quot; (&quot;de hoofdstad Amsterdam&quot;). Previous versions of the constitution only mentioned &quot;the city of Amsterdam&quot; (&quot;de stad Amsterdam&quot;). For a royal investiture, therefore, the States General of the Netherlands (the Dutch Parliament) meets for a ceremonial joint session in Amsterdam. The ceremony traditionally takes place at the Nieuwe Kerk on Dam Square, immediately after the former monarch has signed the act of abdication at the nearby Royal Palace of Amsterdam. Normally, however, the Parliament sits in The Hague, the city which has historically been the seat of the Dutch government, the Dutch monarchy, and the Dutch supreme court. Foreign embassies are also located in The Hague.

===Symbols===

The coat of arms of Amsterdam is composed of several historical elements. First and centre are three St Andrew&#x27;s crosses, aligned in a vertical band on the city&#x27;s shield (although Amsterdam&#x27;s patron saint was Saint Nicholas). These St Andrew&#x27;s crosses can also be found on the city shields of neighbours Amstelveen and Ouder-Amstel. This part of the coat of arms is the basis of the flag of Amsterdam, flown by the city government, but also as civil ensign for ships registered in Amsterdam. Second is the Imperial Crown of Austria. In 1489, out of gratitude for services and loans, Maximilian I awarded Amsterdam the right to adorn its coat of arms with the king&#x27;s crown. Then, in 1508, this was replaced with Maximilian&#x27;s imperial crown when he was crowned Holy Roman Emperor. In the early years of the 17th century, Maximilian&#x27;s crown in Amsterdam&#x27;s coat of arms was again replaced, this time with the crown of Emperor Rudolph II, a crown that became the Imperial Crown of Austria. The lions date from the late 16th century, when the city and province became part of the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands. Last came the city&#x27;s official motto: &quot;Heldhaftig, Vastberaden, Barmhartig&quot; (&quot;Heroic, Determined, Merciful&quot;), bestowed on the city in 1947 by Queen Wilhelmina, in recognition of the city&#x27;s bravery during the Second World War.

==Transport==
===Metro, tram and bus===

Currently, there are sixteen tram routes and five metro routes. All are operated by the municipal public transport operator Gemeentelijk Vervoerbedrijf (GVB), which also runs the city bus network.

Four fare-free GVB ferries carry pedestrians and cyclists across the IJ lake to the borough of Amsterdam-Noord, and two fare-charging ferries run east and west along the harbour. There are also privately operated water taxis, a water bus, a boat-sharing operation, electric rental boats, and canal cruises, that transport people along Amsterdam&#x27;s waterways.

Regional buses, and some suburban buses, are operated by Connexxion and EBS. International coach services are provided by Eurolines from Amsterdam Amstel railway station, IDBUS from Amsterdam Sloterdijk railway station, and Megabus from the Zuiderzeeweg in the east of the city.

To facilitate easier transport to the centre of Amsterdam, the city has various P+R Locations where people can park their car at an affordable price and transfer to one of the numerous public transport lines.

===Car===
Amsterdam was intended in 1932 to be the hub, a kind of Kilometre Zero, of the highway system of the Netherlands, with freeways numbered One to Eight planned to originate from the city. The outbreak of the Second World War and shifting priorities led to the current situation, where only roads A1, A2, and A4 originate from Amsterdam according to the original plan. The A3 to Rotterdam was cancelled in 1970 to conserve the Groene Hart. Road A8, leading north to Zaandam and the A10 Ringroad were opened between 1968 and 1974. Besides the A1, A2, A4 and A8, several freeways, such as the A7 and A6, carry traffic mainly bound for Amsterdam.

The A10 ringroad surrounding the city connects Amsterdam with the Dutch national network of freeways. Interchanges on the A10 allow cars to enter the city by transferring to one of the 18 &quot;city roads&quot;, numbered S101 through to S118. These city roads are regional roads without grade separation, and sometimes without a central reservation. Most are accessible by cyclists. The S100 &quot;Centrumring&quot; is a smaller ring road circumnavigating the city&#x27;s centre.

In the city centre, driving a car is discouraged. Parking fees are expensive, and many streets are closed to cars or are one-way. The local government sponsors carsharing and carpooling initiatives such as &quot;Autodelen&quot; and &quot;Meerijden.nu&quot;. The local government has also started removing parking spaces in the city in 2019, with the goal of removing 10,000 spaces (roughly 1,500 per year) by 2025.

===National rail===

Amsterdam is served by ten stations of the Nederlandse Spoorwegen (Dutch Railways). Five are intercity stops: Sloterdijk, Zuid, Amstel, Bijlmer ArenA and Amsterdam Centraal. The stations for local services are: Lelylaan, RAI, Holendrecht, Muiderpoort and Science Park. Amsterdam Centraal is also an international railway station. From the station, there are regular services to destinations such as Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Russia, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Among these trains are international trains of the Nederlandse Spoorwegen and Deutsche Bahn to Berlin, Eurostar services to Antwerp, Brussels, Paris and London and ICE services to Cologne and Frankfurt.

===Airport===

Amsterdam Airport Schiphol is less than 20 minutes by train from Amsterdam Centraal station and is served by domestic and international intercity trains, such as Eurostar and EuroCity. Schiphol is the largest airport in the Netherlands, the third-largest in Europe, and the 14th-largest in the world in terms of passengers. It handles over 68 million passengers per year and is the home base of four airlines, KLM, Transavia, Martinair and Arkefly. , Schiphol was the fifth busiest airport in the world measured by international passenger numbers. This airport is 4 meters below sea level. Although Schiphol is internationally known as Amsterdam Schiphol Airport it lies in the neighbouring municipality of Haarlemmermeer, southwest of the city.

===Cycling===


Amsterdam is one of the most bicycle-friendly large cities in the world and is a centre of bicycle culture with good facilities for cyclists such as bike paths and bike racks, and several guarded bike storage garages (&quot;fietsenstalling&quot;) which can be used.

According to the most recent figures published by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), in 2015 the 442,693 households (850,000 residents) in Amsterdam together owned 847,000 bicycles – 1.91 bicycles per household. Theft is widespreadin 2011, about 83,000 bicycles were stolen in Amsterdam. Bicycles are used by all socio-economic groups because of their convenience, Amsterdam&#x27;s small size, the of bike paths, the flat terrain, and the inconvenience of driving an automobile.

==Education==

Amsterdam has two universities: the University of Amsterdam (&quot;Universiteit van Amsterdam&quot;, UvA), and the &quot;Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam&quot; (VU). Other institutions for higher education include an art school – Gerrit Rietveld Academie, a university of applied sciences – the Hogeschool van Amsterdam, and the Amsterdamse Hogeschool voor de Kunsten. Amsterdam&#x27;s International Institute of Social History is one of the world&#x27;s largest documentary and research institutions concerning social history, and especially the history of the labour movement. Amsterdam&#x27;s Hortus Botanicus, founded in the early 17th century, is one of the oldest botanical gardens in the world, with many old and rare specimens, among them the coffee plant that served as the parent for the entire coffee culture in Central and South America.

There are over 200 primary schools in Amsterdam. Some of these primary schools base their teachings on particular pedagogic theories like the various Montessori schools. The biggest Montessori high school in Amsterdam is the Montessori Lyceum Amsterdam. Many schools, however, are based on religion. This used to be primarily Roman Catholicism and various Protestant denominations, but with the influx of Muslim immigrants, there has been a rise in the number of Islamic schools. Jewish schools can be found in the southern suburbs of Amsterdam.
Amsterdam is noted for having five independent grammar schools (Dutch: gymnasia), the Vossius Gymnasium, Barlaeus Gymnasium, St. Ignatius Gymnasium, Het 4e Gymnasium and the Cygnus Gymnasium where a classical curriculum including Latin and classical Greek is taught. Though believed until recently by many to be an anachronistic and elitist concept that would soon die out, the gymnasia have recently experienced a revival, leading to the formation of a fourth and fifth grammar school in which the three aforementioned schools participate. Most secondary schools in Amsterdam offer a variety of different levels of education in the same school. The city also has various colleges ranging from art and design to politics and economics which are mostly also available for students coming from other countries.

Schools for foreign nationals in Amsterdam include the Amsterdam International Community School, British School of Amsterdam, Albert Einstein International School Amsterdam, Lycée Vincent van Gogh La Haye-Amsterdam primary campus (French school), International School of Amsterdam, and the Japanese School of Amsterdam.

==Notable people==
==Media==
Amsterdam is a prominent centre for national and international media. Some locally based newspapers include &quot;Het Parool&quot;, a national daily paper; &quot;De Telegraaf&quot;, the largest Dutch daily newspaper; the daily newspapers &quot;Trouw&quot;, &quot;de Volkskrant&quot; and &quot;NRC&quot;; &quot;De Groene Amsterdammer&quot;, a weekly newspaper; the free newspapers &quot;Metro&quot; and &quot;The Holland Times&quot; (printed in English).

Amsterdam is home to the second-largest Dutch commercial TV group SBS Broadcasting Group, consisting of TV stations SBS 6, Net 5, and Veronica. However, Amsterdam is not considered &#x27;the media city of the Netherlands&#x27;. The town of Hilversum, south-east of Amsterdam, has been crowned with this unofficial title. Hilversum is the principal centre for radio and television broadcasting in the Netherlands. Radio Netherlands, heard worldwide via shortwave radio since the 1920s, is also based there. Hilversum is home to an extensive complex of audio and television studios belonging to the national broadcast production company NOS, as well as to the studios and offices of all the Dutch public broadcasting organisations and many commercial TV production companies.

In 2012, the music video for &quot;Live My Life&quot; by Far East Movement was filmed in various parts of Amsterdam.

Several movies have been filmed in Amsterdam, including the James Bond film &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;, &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Twelve&quot;, &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot;, &quot;Kidnapping Mr. Heineken&quot;, &quot;Layer Cake&quot; and &quot;The Hitman&#x27;s Bodyguard&quot;. Amsterdam is also featured in John Green&#x27;s book &quot;The Fault in Our Stars&quot;, which was made into a film that also partly takes place in Amsterdam.

==Housing==

From the late 1960s onwards many buildings in Amsterdam have been squatted both for housing and for use as social centres. A number of these squats have legalised and become well known, such as OCCII, OT301, Paradiso and Vrankrijk.

<text>The Museum of Work (&quot;Arbetets museum&quot;) is a museum located in Norrköping, Sweden. The museum is located in the &quot;Strykjärn&quot; (Clothes iron), a former weaving mill in the old industrial area on the Motala ström river in the city centre of Norrköping. The former textile factory Holmens Bruk (sv) operated in the building from 1917 to 1962.

The museum documents work and everyday life by collecting personal stories about people&#x27;s professional lives from both the past and the present. The museum&#x27;s archive contain material from memory collections and documentation projects.

Since 2009, the museum also houses the EWK – Center for Political Illustration Art, which is based on work of the satirist Ewert Karlsson (1918–2004). For decades he was frequently published in the Swedish tabloid, &quot;Aftonbladet&quot;.

== Overview ==
The museum is a national central museum with the task of preserving and telling about work and everyday life. It has, among other things, exhibitions on the terms and conditions of the work and the history of the industrial society. The museum is also known to highlight gender perspective in their exhibitions.

The work museum documents work and everyday life by collecting personal stories, including people&#x27;s professional life from both the past and present. In the museum&#x27;s archive, there is a rich material of memory collections and documentation projects – over 2600 interviews, stories and photodocumentations have been collected since the museum opened.

The museum is also a support for the country&#x27;s approximately 1,500 working life museums that are old workplaces preserved to convey their history.

== Exhibitions ==
The Museum of Work shows exhibitions going on over several years, but also shorter exhibitions – including several photo exhibitions on themes that can be linked to work and everyday life.

=== The history of Alva ===
The history of Alva Karlsson is the only exhibition in the museum that is permanent. The exhibition connects to the museum&#x27;s building and its history as part of the textile industry in Norrköping. Alva worked as a rollers between the years 1927 – 1962.

=== Industriland ===
One of the museum long-term exhibitions is Industriland – when Sweden became modern, the exhibition was in 2007–2013 and consisted of an ongoing bond with various objects that were somehow significant both for working life and everyday during the period 1930–1980. The exhibition also consisted of presentations of the working life museums in Sweden and a number of rooms with themes such as: leisure, world, living and consumption.

=== Framtidsland (Future country) ===
In 2014, the exhibition was inaugurated that takes by where Industriland ends: Future country. It is an exhibition that investigates what a sustainable society is will be part of the museum&#x27;s exhibitions until 2019. The exhibition consists of materials that are designed based on conversations between young people and researchers around Sweden. The exhibition addresses themes such as work, environment and everyday life. A tour version of the exhibition is given in the locations Falun, Kristianstad and Örebro.

== EWK – The Center for Political Illustration Art ==
Since 2009, the Museum also houses EWK – center for political illustration art. The museum preserves, develops and conveys the political illustrator Ewert Karlsson&#x27;s production. The museum also holds theme exhibitions with national and international political illustrators with the aim of highlighting and strengthening the political art.

<text>Audi AG () is a German automotive manufacturer of luxury vehicles headquartered in Ingolstadt, Bavaria, Germany. A subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group, Audi produces vehicles in nine production facilities worldwide.

The origins of the company are complex, dating back to the early 20th century and the initial enterprises (Horch and the &quot;Audiwerke&quot;) founded by engineer August Horch. Two other manufacturers (DKW and Wanderer) also contributed to the foundation of Auto Union in 1932. The modern Audi era began in the 1960s, when Auto Union was acquired by Volkswagen from Daimler-Benz. After relaunching the Audi brand with the 1965 introduction of the Audi F103 series, Volkswagen merged Auto Union with NSU Motorenwerke in 1969, thus creating the present-day form of the company.

The company name is based on the Latin translation of the surname of the founder, August Horch. , meaning &#x27;listen&#x27;, becomes in Latin. The four rings of the Audi logo each represent one of four car companies that banded together to create Audi&#x27;s predecessor company, Auto Union. Audi&#x27;s slogan is , which is translated as &#x27;Progress through Technology&#x27;. Audi, along with German brands BMW and Mercedes-Benz, is among the best-selling luxury automobile brands in the world.
==History==

===Birth of the company and its name===
Automobile company Wanderer was originally established in 1885, later becoming a branch of Audi AG. Another company, NSU, which also later merged into Audi, was founded during this time, and later supplied the chassis for Gottlieb Daimler&#x27;s four-wheeler.

On 14 November 1899, August Horch (1868–1951) established the company A. Horch &amp; Cie. in the Ehrenfeld district of Cologne. In 1902, he moved with his company to Reichenbach im Vogtland. On 10 May 1904, he founded the August Horch &amp; Cie. Motorwagenwerke AG, a joint-stock company in Zwickau (State of Saxony).

After troubles with Horch chief financial officer, August Horch left Motorwagenwerke and founded in Zwickau on 16 July 1909, his second company, the August Horch Automobilwerke GmbH. His former partners sued him for trademark infringement. The German Reichsgericht (Supreme Court) in Leipzig, eventually determined that the Horch brand belonged to his former company.
Since August Horch was prohibited from using &quot;horch&quot; as a trade name in his new car business, he called a meeting with close business friends, Paul and Franz Fikentscher from Zwickau. At the apartment of Franz Fikentscher, they discussed how to come up with a new name for the company. During this meeting, Franz&#x27;s son was quietly studying Latin in a corner of the room. Several times he looked like he was on the verge of saying something but would just swallow his words and continue working, until he finally blurted out, &quot;Father – &quot;audiatur et altera pars&quot;... wouldn&#x27;t it be a good idea to call it &quot;audi&quot; instead of &quot;horch&quot;?&quot;. &quot;Horch&quot; in German means &#x27;hark&#x27; or &#x27;hear&#x27;, which is &quot;audi&quot; in the singular imperative form of &quot;audire&quot;—&#x27;to listen&#x27;—in Latin. The idea was enthusiastically accepted by everyone attending the meeting. On 25 April 1910 the Audi Automobilwerke GmbH Zwickau (from 1915 on Audiwerke AG Zwickau) was entered in the company&#x27;s register of Zwickau registration court.

The first Audi automobile, the Audi Type A 10/ Sport-Phaeton, was produced in the same year, followed by the successor Type B 10/28PS in the same year.

Audi started with a 2,612 cc straight-four engine model Type A, followed by a 3,564 cc model, as well as 4,680 cc and 5,720 cc models. These cars were successful even in sporting events. The first six-cylinder model Type M, 4,655 cc appeared in 1924.

August Horch left the &quot;Audiwerke&quot; in 1920 for a high position at the ministry of transport, but he was still involved with Audi as a member of the board of trustees. In September 1921, Audi became the first German car manufacturer to present a production car, the Audi Type K, with left-handed drive. Left-hand drive spread and established dominance during the 1920s because it provided a better view of oncoming traffic, making overtaking safer when driving on the right.

===The merger of the four companies under the logo of four rings===
In August 1928, Jørgen Rasmussen, the owner of Dampf-Kraft-Wagen (DKW), acquired the majority of shares in Audiwerke AG. In the same year, Rasmussen bought the remains of the U.S. automobile manufacturer Rickenbacker, including the manufacturing equipment for 8-cylinder engines. These engines were used in &quot;Audi Zwickau&quot; and &quot;Audi Dresden&quot; models that were launched in 1929. At the same time, 6-cylinder and 4-cylinder (the &quot;four&quot; with a Peugeot engine) models were manufactured. Audi cars of that era were luxurious cars equipped with special bodywork.

In 1932, Audi merged with Horch, DKW, and Wanderer, to form Auto Union AG, Chemnitz. It was during this period that the company offered the Audi Front that became the first European car to combine a six-cylinder engine with front-wheel drive. It used a power train shared with the Wanderer, but turned 180 degrees, so that the drive shaft faced the front.

Before World War II, Auto Union used the four interlinked rings that make up the Audi badge today, representing these four brands. However, this badge was used only on Auto Union racing cars in that period while the member companies used their own names and emblems. The technological development became more and more concentrated and some Audi models were propelled by Horch- or Wanderer-built engines.

Reflecting the economic pressures of the time, Auto Union concentrated increasingly on smaller cars through the 1930s, so that by 1938 the company&#x27;s DKW brand accounted for 17.9% of the German car market, while Audi held only 0.1%. After the final few Audis were delivered in 1939 the &quot;Audi&quot; name disappeared completely from the new car market for more than two decades.

===World War II===
Richard Bruhn, a Nazi party member, was Auto Union&#x27;s chairman of the board from 1932 to 1945 and then again after the war when the company was reestablished. In 2014 Audi became the last major German car company, after Volkswagen, BMW and Daimler, to commission a study of their wartime activities. The investigation found that the company worked with the SS to build seven labor camps where more than 3,700 prisoners were put to work for Auto Union. In addition, 16,500 more people were forced to work at the company&#x27;s factories in Zwickau and Chemnitz, and another 18,000 at an underground plant in Bavaria where 4,500 people died.

Some of the company&#x27;s factories were bombed by the Allies.

===Post-World War II===

With no prospect of continuing production in Soviet-controlled East Germany, Auto Union executives began the process of relocating what was left of the company to West Germany. A site was chosen in Ingolstadt, Bavaria, to start a spare parts operation in late 1945, which would eventually serve as the headquarters of the reformed Auto Union in 1949.

On 17 August 1948, Auto Union AG of Chemnitz was deleted from the commercial register. These actions had the effect of liquidating Germany&#x27;s Auto Union AG. The remains of the Audi plant of Zwickau became the VEB (for &quot;People Owned Enterprise&quot;) or AWZ (in English: Automobile Works Zwickau).

The former Audi factory in Zwickau restarted assembly of the pre-war models in 1949. These DKW models were renamed to IFA F8 and IFA F9 and were similar to the West German versions. West and East German models were equipped with the traditional and renowned DKW two-stroke engines. The Zwickau plant later manufactured the infamous Trabant until 1991, after it was acquired by the Volkswagen Group following the reunification of Germany, and has since been substantially rebuilt. In 2021, production of the Audi Q4 e-tron began at the plant, marking the return of Audis being manufactured at Zwickau after over 80 years.

===New Auto Union unit===
A new West German headquartered Auto Union was launched in Ingolstadt with loans from the Bavarian state government and Marshall Plan aid. The reformed company was launched 3 September 1949 and continued DKW&#x27;s tradition of producing front-wheel drive vehicles with two-stroke engines. This included production of a small but sturdy 125 cc motorcycle and a DKW delivery van, the DKW F89 L at Ingolstadt. The Ingolstadt site was large, consisting of an extensive complex of formerly military buildings which was suitable for administration as well as vehicle warehousing and distribution, but at this stage there was at Ingolstadt no dedicated plant suitable for mass production of automobiles: for manufacturing the company&#x27;s first post-war mass-market passenger car plant capacity in Düsseldorf was rented from Rheinmetall-Borsig. It was only ten years later, after the company had attracted an investor, when funds became available for construction of major car plant at the Ingolstadt head office site.

In 1958, in response to pressure from Friedrich Flick, then the company&#x27;s largest single shareholder, Daimler-Benz took an 87% holding in the Auto Union company, and this was increased to a 100% holding in 1959. However, small two-stroke cars were not the focus of Daimler-Benz&#x27;s interests, and while the early 1960s saw major investment in new Mercedes models and in a state of the art factory for Auto Union&#x27;s, the company&#x27;s aging model range at this time did not benefit from the economic boom of the early 1960s to the same extent as competitor manufacturers such as Volkswagen and Opel. The decision to dispose of the Auto Union business was based on its lack of profitability. Ironically, by the time they sold the business, it also included a large new factory and near production-ready modern four-stroke engine, which would enable the Auto Union business, under a new owner, to embark on a period of profitable growth, now producing not Auto Unions or DKWs, but using the &quot;Audi&quot; name, resurrected in 1965 after a 25-year gap.

In 1964, Volkswagen acquired a 50% holding in the business, which included the new factory in Ingolstadt, the DKW and Audi brands along with the rights to the new engine design which had been funded by Daimler-Benz, who in return retained the dormant Horch trademark and the Düsseldorf factory which became a Mercedes-Benz van assembly plant. Eighteen months later, Volkswagen bought complete control of Ingolstadt, and by 1966 were using the spare capacity of the Ingolstadt plant to assemble an additional 60,000 Volkswagen Beetles per year. Two-stroke engines became less popular during the 1960s as customers were more attracted to the smoother four-stroke engines. In September 1965, the DKW F102 was fitted with a four-stroke engine and a facelift for the car&#x27;s front and rear. Volkswagen dumped the DKW brand because of its associations with two-stroke technology, and having classified the model internally as the F103, sold it simply as the &quot;Audi&quot;. Later developments of the model were named after their horsepower ratings and sold as the Audi 60, 75, 80, and Super 90, selling until 1972. Initially, Volkswagen was hostile to the idea of Auto Union as a standalone entity producing its own models having acquired the company merely to boost its own production capacity through the Ingolstadt assembly plant—to the point where Volkswagen executives ordered that the Auto Union name and flags bearing the four rings were removed from the factory buildings. Then VW chief Heinz Nordhoff explicitly forbade Auto Union from any further product development. Fearing that Volkswagen had no long-term ambition for the Audi brand, Auto Union engineers under the leadership of Ludwig Kraus developed the first Audi 100 in secret, without Nordhoff&#x27;s knowledge. When presented with a finished prototype, Nordhoff was so impressed he authorised the car for production, which when launched in 1968, went on to be a huge success. With this, the resurrection of the Audi brand was now complete, this being followed by the first generation Audi 80 in 1972, which would in turn provide a template for VW&#x27;s new front-wheel-drive water-cooled range which debuted from the mid-1970s onward.
In 1969, Auto Union merged with NSU, based in Neckarsulm, near Stuttgart. In the 1950s, NSU had been the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of motorcycles, but had moved on to produce small cars like the NSU Prinz, the TT and TTS versions of which are still popular as vintage race cars. NSU then focused on new rotary engines based on the ideas of Felix Wankel. In 1967, the new NSU Ro 80 was a car well ahead of its time in technical details such as aerodynamics, light weight, and safety. However, teething problems with the rotary engines put an end to the independence of NSU. The Neckarsulm plant is now used to produce the larger Audi models A6 and A8. The Neckarsulm factory is also home of the &quot;quattro GmbH&quot; (from November 2016 &quot;Audi Sport GmbH&quot;), a subsidiary responsible for development and production of Audi high-performance models: the R8 and the RS model range.

===Modern era===

The new merged company was incorporated on 1 January 1969 and was known as Audi NSU Auto Union AG, with its headquarters at NSU&#x27;s Neckarsulm plant, and saw the emergence of Audi as a separate brand for the first time since the pre-war era. Volkswagen introduced the Audi brand to the United States for the 1970 model year. That same year, the mid-sized car that NSU had been working on, the K70, originally intended to slot between the rear-engined Prinz models and the futuristic NSU Ro 80, was instead launched as a Volkswagen.

After the launch of the Audi 100 of 1968, the Audi 80/Fox (which formed the basis for the 1973 Volkswagen Passat) followed in 1972 and the Audi 50 (later rebadged as the Volkswagen Polo) in 1974. The Audi 50 was a seminal design because it was the first incarnation of the Golf/Polo concept, one that led to a hugely successful world car. Ultimately, the Audi 80 and 100 (progenitors of the A4 and A6, respectively) became the company&#x27;s biggest sellers, whilst little investment was made in the fading NSU range; the Prinz models were dropped in 1973 whilst the fatally flawed NSU Ro80 went out of production in 1977, spelling the effective end of the NSU brand. Production of the Audi 100 had been steadily moved from Ingolstadt to Neckarsulm as the 1970s had progressed, and by the appearance of the second generation C2 version in 1976, all production was now at the former NSU plant. Neckarsulm from that point onward would produce Audi&#x27;s higher-end models.

The Audi image at this time was a conservative one, and so, a proposal from chassis engineer Jörg Bensinger was accepted to develop the four-wheel drive technology in Volkswagen&#x27;s Iltis military vehicle for an Audi performance car and rally racing car. The performance car, introduced in 1980, was named the &quot;Audi Quattro&quot;, a turbocharged coupé which was also the first German large-scale production vehicle to feature permanent all-wheel drive through a centre differential. Commonly referred to as the &quot;Ur-Quattro&quot; (the &quot;Ur-&quot; prefix is a German augmentative used, in this case, to mean &#x27;original&#x27; and is also applied to the first generation of Audi&#x27;s S4 and S6 Sport Saloons, as in &quot;UrS4&quot; and &quot;UrS6&quot;), few of these vehicles were produced (all hand-built by a single team), but the model was a great success in rallying. Prominent wins proved the viability of all-wheel-drive racecars, and the Audi name became associated with advances in automotive technology.

In 1985, with the Auto Union and NSU brands effectively dead, the company&#x27;s official name was now shortened to simply Audi AG. At the same time the company&#x27;s headquarters moved back to Ingolstadt and two new wholly owned subsidiaries; &quot;Auto Union GmbH&quot; and &quot;NSU GmbH&quot;, were formed to own and manage the historical trademarks and intellectual property of the original constituent companies (the exception being Horch, which had been retained by Daimler-Benz after the VW takeover), and to operate Audi&#x27;s heritage operations.
In 1986, as the Passat-based Audi 80 was beginning to develop a kind of &quot;grandfather&#x27;s car&quot; image, the &quot;type 89&quot; was introduced. This completely new development sold extremely well. However, its modern and dynamic exterior belied the low performance of its base engine, and its base package was quite spartan (even the passenger-side mirror was an option). In 1987, Audi put forward a new and very elegant Audi 90, which had a much superior set of standard features. In the early 1990s, sales began to slump for the Audi 80 series, and some basic construction problems started to surface.

Through the early 1990s, Audi began to shift its target market upscale to compete against German automakers Mercedes-Benz and BMW. This began with the release of the Audi V8 in 1990. It was essentially a new engine fitted to the Audi 100/200, but with noticeable bodywork differences. Most obvious was the new grille that was now incorporated in the bonnet.

By 1991, Audi had the four-cylinder Audi 80, the 5-cylinder Audi 90 and Audi 100, the turbocharged Audi 200 and the Audi V8. There was also a coupé version of the 80/90 with both four- and five-cylinder engines.

Although the five-cylinder engine was a successful and robust powerplant, it was still a little too different for the target market. With the introduction of an all-new Audi 100 in 1992, Audi introduced a 2.8L V6 engine. This engine was also fitted to a face-lifted Audi 80 (all 80 and 90 models were now badged 80 except for the USA), giving this model a choice of four-, five-, and six-cylinder engines, in saloon, coupé and convertible body styles.

The five-cylinder was soon dropped as a major engine choice; however, a turbocharged version remained. The engine, initially fitted to the 200 quattro 20V of 1991, was a derivative of the engine fitted to the Sport Quattro. It was fitted to the Audi Coupé, named the S2, and also to the Audi 100 body, and named the S4. These two models were the beginning of the mass-produced S series of performance cars.

===Audi 5000 unintended acceleration allegations===
Sales in the United States fell after a series of recalls from 1982 to 1987 of Audi 5000 models associated with reported incidents of sudden unintended acceleration linked to six deaths and 700 accidents. At the time, NHTSA was investigating 50 car models from 20 manufacturers for sudden surges of power.

A &quot;60 Minutes&quot; report aired 23 November 1986, featuring interviews with six people who had sued Audi after reporting unintended acceleration, showing an Audi 5000 ostensibly suffering a problem when the brake pedal was pushed. Subsequent investigation revealed that &quot;60 Minutes&quot; had engineered the failure—fitting a canister of compressed air on the passenger-side floor, linked via a hose to a hole drilled into the transmission.

Audi contended, prior to findings by outside investigators, that the problems were caused by driver error, specifically pedal misapplication. Subsequently, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) concluded that the majority of unintended acceleration cases, including all the ones that prompted the &quot;60 Minutes&quot; report, were caused by driver error such as confusion of pedals. CBS did not acknowledge the test results of involved government agencies, but did acknowledge the similar results of another study.

In a review study published in 2012, NHTSA summarized its past findings about the Audi unintended acceleration problems: &quot;Once an unintended acceleration had begun, in the Audi 5000, due to a failure in the idle-stabilizer system (producing an initial acceleration of 0.3g), pedal misapplication resulting from panic, confusion, or unfamiliarity with the Audi 5000 contributed to the severity of the incident.&quot;

This summary is consistent with the conclusions of NHTSA&#x27;s most technical analysis at the time: &quot;Audi idle-stabilization systems were prone to defects which resulted in excessive idle speeds and brief unanticipated accelerations of up to 0.3g [which is similar in magnitude to an emergency stop in a subway car]. These accelerations could not be the sole cause of [(long-duration) sudden acceleration incidents (SAI)], but might have triggered some SAIs by startling the driver. The defective idle-stabilization system performed a type of electronic throttle control. Significantly: multiple &quot;intermittent malfunctions of the electronic control unit were observed and recorded ... and [were also observed and] reported by Transport Canada.&quot;

With a series of recall campaigns, Audi made several modifications; the first adjusted the distance between the brake and accelerator pedal on automatic-transmission models. Later repairs, of 250,000 cars dating back to 1978, added a device requiring the driver to press the brake pedal before shifting out of park. A legacy of the Audi 5000 and other reported cases of sudden unintended acceleration are intricate gear stick patterns and brake interlock mechanisms to prevent inadvertent shifting into forward or reverse. It is unclear how the defects in the idle-stabilization system were addressed.

Audi&#x27;s U.S. sales, which had reached 74,061 in 1985, dropped to 12,283 in 1991 and remained level for three years,—with resale values falling dramatically. Audi subsequently offered increased warranty protection and renamed the affected models—with the &quot;5000&quot; becoming the &quot;100&quot; and &quot;200&quot; in 1989—and reached the same sales levels again only by model year 2000.

A 2010 &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; article—outlining possible parallels between Audi&#x27;s experience and 2009–2010 Toyota vehicle recalls—noted a class-action lawsuit filed in 1987 by about 7,500 Audi 5000-model owners remains unsettled and remains contested in Chicago&#x27;s Cook County after appeals at the Illinois state and U.S. federal levels.

===Model introductions===
In the mid-to-late 1990s, Audi introduced new technologies including the use of aluminium construction. Produced from 1999 to 2005, the Audi A2 was a futuristic super mini, born from the Al2 concept, with many features that helped regain consumer confidence, like the aluminium space frame, which was a first in production car design. In the A2 Audi further expanded their TDI technology through the use of frugal three-cylinder engines. The A2 was extremely aerodynamic and was designed around a wind tunnel. The Audi A2 was criticised for its high price and was never really a sales success but it planted Audi as a cutting-edge manufacturer. The model, a Mercedes-Benz A-Class competitor, sold relatively well in Europe. However, the A2 was discontinued in 2005 and Audi decided not to develop an immediate replacement.

The next major model change came in 1995 when the Audi A4 replaced the Audi 80. The new nomenclature scheme was applied to the Audi 100 to become the Audi A6 (with a minor facelift). This also meant the S4 became the S6 and a new S4 was introduced in the A4 body. The S2 was discontinued. The Audi Cabriolet continued on (based on the Audi 80 platform) until 1999, gaining the engine upgrades along the way. A new A3 hatchback model (sharing the Volkswagen Golf Mk4&#x27;s platform) was introduced to the range in 1996, and the radical Audi TT coupé and roadster were debuted in 1998 based on the same underpinnings.

The petrol engines available throughout the range were now a 1.4 L, 1.6 L and 1.8 L four-cylinder, 1.8 L four-cylinder turbo, 2.6 L and 2.8 L V6, 2.2 L turbo-charged five-cylinder and the 4.2 L V8 engine. The V6s were replaced by new 2.4 L and 2.8 L 30V V6s in 1998, with marked improvement in power, torque and smoothness. Further engines were added along the way, including a 3.7 L V8 and 6.0 L W12 engine for the A8.

===Audi AG today===
Audi&#x27;s sales grew strongly in the 2000s, with deliveries to customers increasing from 653,000 in 2000 to 1,003,000 in 2008. The largest sales increases came from Eastern Europe (+19.3%), Africa (+17.2%) and the Middle East (+58.5%). China in particular has become a key market, representing 108,000 out of 705,000 cars delivered in the first three quarters of 2009. One factor for its popularity in China is that Audis have become the car of choice for purchase by the Chinese government for officials, and purchases by the government are responsible for 20% of its sales in China. As of late 2009, Audi&#x27;s operating profit of €1.17 billion ($1.85 billion) made it the biggest contributor to parent Volkswagen Group&#x27;s nine-month operating profit of €1.5 billion, while the other marques in Group such as Bentley and SEAT had suffered considerable losses. May 2011 saw record sales for Audi of America with the new Audi A7 and Audi A3 TDI Clean Diesel. In May 2012, Audi reported a 10% increase in its sales—from 408 units to 480 in the last year alone.

Audi manufactures vehicles in seven plants around the world, some of which are shared with other VW Group marques although many sub-assemblies such as engines and transmissions are manufactured within other Volkswagen Group plants.

Audi&#x27;s two principal assembly plants in Germany are:
* Ingolstadt, the former Auto Union site originally opened in 1945 and substantially rebuilt by Daimler-Benz in 1962, and acquired by Volkswagen in 1964 (Q2, A3, A4, A5)
* Neckarsulm, the former NSU plant, acquired by Volkswagen in 1969: (A4, A5 (cabrio), A6, A7, A8, R8, and all RS variants) - a satellite plant at nearby Böllinger Höfe produces the e-tron GT

Outside of Germany, Audi produces vehicles at:
* Aurangabad, India, since 2006
* Bratislava, Slovakia, shared with Volkswagen, SEAT, Škoda and Porsche (Q7 and Q8)
* Brussels, Belgium, acquired from Volkswagen in 2007 (e-tron)
* Changchun, China, since 1995
* Győr, Hungary (TT, A3, Q3)
* Jakarta, Indonesia, since 2011
* Martorell, Spain, shared with SEAT and Volkswagen (A1, Q3)
* San José Chiapa, Mexico (2nd gen Q5)

In September 2012, Audi announced the construction of its first North American manufacturing plant in Puebla, Mexico. This plant became operative in 2016 and produces the second generation Q5.

From 2002 up to 2003, Audi headed the Audi Brand Group, a subdivision of the Volkswagen Group&#x27;s Automotive Division consisting of Audi, Lamborghini and SEAT, which was focused on sporty values, with the marques&#x27; product vehicles and performance being under the higher responsibility of the Audi brand.

In January 2014, Audi, along with the Wireless Power Consortium, operated a booth which demonstrated a phone compartment using the Qi open interface standard at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES). In May, most of the Audi dealers in the UK falsely claimed that the Audi A7, A8, and R8 were Euro NCAP safety tested, all achieving five out of five stars. In fact none were tested.

In 2015, Audi admitted that at least 2.1 million Audi cars had been involved in the Volkswagen emissions testing scandal in which software installed in the cars manipulated emissions data to fool regulators and allow the cars to pollute at higher than government-mandated levels. The A1, A3, A4, A5, A6, TT, Q3 and Q5 models were implicated in the scandal. Audi promised to quickly find a technical solution and upgrade the cars so they can function within emissions regulations. Ulrich Hackenberg, the head of research and development at Audi, was suspended in relation to the scandal. Despite widespread media coverage about the scandal through the month of September, Audi reported that U.S. sales for the month had increased by 16.2%. Audi&#x27;s parent company Volkswagen announced on 18 June 2018 that Audi chief executive Rupert Stadler had been arrested.

In November 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency implicated the 3-liter diesel engine versions of the 2016 Audi A6 Quattro, A7 Quattro, A8, A8L and the Q5 as further models that had emissions regulation defeat-device software installed. Thus, these models emitted nitrogen oxide at up to nine times the legal limit when the car detected that it was not hooked up to emissions testing equipment.

In November 2016, Audi expressed an intention to establish an assembly factory in Pakistan, with the company&#x27;s local partner acquiring land for a plant in Korangi Creek Industrial Park in Karachi. Approval of the plan would lead to an investment of $30 million in the new plant. Audi planned to cut 9,500 jobs in Germany starting from 2020 till 2025 to fund electric vehicles and digital working.

In February 2020, Volkswagen AG announced that it plans to take over all Audi shares it does not own (totalling 0.36%) via a squeeze-out according to German stock corporation law, thus making Audi a fully owned subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group. This change took effect from 16 November 2020, when Audi became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group.

In January 2021, Audi announced that it is planning to sell 1 million vehicles in China in 2023, comparing to 726,000 vehicles in 2020.

==Technology==

=== Audi AI ===
Audi AI is a driver assist feature offered by Audi. The company&#x27;s stated intent is to offer fully autonomous driving at a future time, acknowledging that legal, regulatory and technical hurdles must be overcome to achieve this goal. On 4 June 2017, Audi stated that its new A8 will be fully self-driving for speeds up to 60 km/h using its Audi AI. Contrary to other cars, the driver will not have to do safety checks such as touching the steering wheel every 15 seconds to use this feature. The Audi A8 will therefore be the first production car to reach level 3 autonomous driving, meaning that the driver can safely turn their attention away from driving tasks, e.g. the driver can text or watch a movie. Audi will also be the first manufacturer to use a 3D Lidar system in addition to cameras and ultrasonic sensors for their AI.

===Bodyshells===
Audi produces 100% galvanised cars to prevent corrosion, and was the first mass-market vehicle to do so, following introduction of the process by Porsche, c. 1975. Along with other precautionary measures, the full-body zinc coating has proved to be very effective in preventing rust. The body&#x27;s resulting durability even surpassed Audi&#x27;s own expectations, causing the manufacturer to extend its original 10-year warranty against corrosion perforation to currently 12 years (except for aluminium bodies which do not rust).

===Space Frame===
Audi introduced a new series of vehicles in the mid-1990s and continues to pursue new technology and high performance. An all-aluminium car was brought forward by Audi, and in 1994 the Audi A8 was launched, which introduced aluminium space frame technology (called &quot;Audi Space Frame&quot; or ASF) which saves weight and improves torsion rigidity compared to a conventional steel frame. Prior to that effort, Audi used examples of the Type 44 chassis fabricated out of aluminium as test-beds for the technique. The disadvantage of the aluminium frame is that it is very expensive to repair and requires a specialized aluminium bodyshop. The weight reduction is somewhat offset by the quattro four-wheel drive system which is standard in most markets. Nonetheless, the A8 is usually the lightest all-wheel drive car in the full-size luxury segment, also having best-in-class fuel economy. The Audi A2, Audi TT and Audi R8 also use Audi Space Frame designs.

===Drivetrains===

====Layout====
For most of its lineup (excluding the A3, A1, and TT models), Audi has not adopted the transverse engine layout which is typically found in economy cars (such as Peugeot and Citroën), since that would limit the type and power of engines that can be installed. To be able to mount powerful engines (such as a V8 engine in the Audi S4 and Audi RS4, as well as the W12 engine in the Audi A8L W12), Audi has usually engineered its more expensive cars with a longitudinally front-mounted engine, in an &quot;overhung&quot; position, over the front wheels in front of the axle line—this layout dates back to the DKW and Auto Union saloons from the 1950s. But while this allows for the easy adoption of all-wheel drive, it goes against the ideal 50:50 weight distribution.

In all its post Volkswagen era models, Audi has firmly refused to adopt the traditional rear-wheel drive layout favored by its two archrivals Mercedes-Benz and BMW, favoring either front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. The majority of Audi&#x27;s lineup in the United States features all-wheel drive standard on most of its expensive vehicles (only the entry-level trims of the A4 and A6 are available with front-wheel drive), in contrast to Mercedes-Benz and BMW whose lineup treats all-wheel drive as an option. BMW did not offer all-wheel drive on its V8-powered cars (as opposed to crossover SUVs) until the 2010 BMW 7 Series and 2011 BMW 5 Series, while the Audi A8 has had all-wheel drive available/standard since the 1990s. Regarding high-performance variants, Audi S and RS models have always had all-wheel drive, unlike their direct rivals from BMW M and Mercedes-AMG whose cars are rear-wheel drive only (although their performance crossover SUVs are all-wheel drive).

Audi has recently applied the &quot;quattro&quot; badge to models such as the A3 and TT which do not use the Torsen-based system as in prior years with a mechanical center differential, but with the Haldex Traction electro-mechanical clutch AWD system.

====Engines====

Prior to the introduction of the Audi 80 and Audi 50 in 1972 and 1974, respectively, Audi had led the development of the &quot;EA111&quot; and &quot;EA827&quot; inline-four engine families. These new power units underpinned the water-cooled revival of parent company Volkswagen (in the Polo, Golf, Passat and Scirocco), whilst the many derivatives and descendants of these two basic engine designs have appeared in every generation of VW Group vehicles right up to the present day.

In the 1980s, Audi, along with Volvo, was the champion of the inline-five cylinder, 2.1/2.2 L engine as a longer-lasting alternative to more traditional six-cylinder engines. This engine was used not only in production cars but also in their race cars. The 2.1 L inline five-cylinder engine was used as a base for the rally cars in the 1980s, providing well over after modification. Before 1990, there were engines produced with a displacement between 2.0 L and 2.3 L. This range of engine capacity allowed for both fuel economy and power.

For the ultra-luxury version of its Audi A8 fullsize luxury flagship sedan, the Audi A8L W12, Audi uses the Volkswagen Group W12 engine instead of the conventional V12 engine favored by rivals Mercedes-Benz and BMW. The W12 engine configuration (also known as a &quot;WR12&quot;) is created by forming two imaginary narrow-angle 15° VR6 engines at an angle of 72°, and the narrow angle of each set of cylinders allows just two overhead camshafts to drive each pair of banks, so just four are needed in total. The advantage of the W12 engine is its compact packaging, allowing Audi to build a 12-cylinder sedan with all-wheel drive, whereas a conventional V12 engine could have only a rear-wheel drive configuration as it would have no space in the engine bay for a differential and other components required to power the front wheels. In fact, the 6.0 L W12 in the Audi A8L W12 is smaller in overall dimensions than the 4.2 L V8 that powers the Audi A8 4.2 variants. The 2011 Audi A8 debuted a revised 6.3-litre version of the W12 (WR12) engine with .

====Fuel Stratified Injection====
New models of the A3, A4, A6 and A8 have been introduced, with the ageing 1.8-litre engine now having been replaced by new Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) engines. Nearly every petroleum burning model in the range now incorporates this fuel-saving technology.

====Direct-Shift Gearbox====
In 2003, Volkswagen introduced the Direct-Shift Gearbox (DSG), a type of dual-clutch transmission. It is a type of automatic transmission, drivable like a conventional torque converter automatic transmission. Based on the gearbox found in the Group B S1, the system includes dual electro-hydraulically controlled clutches instead of a torque converter. This is implemented in some VW Golfs, Audi A3, Audi A4 and TT models where DSG is called S-Tronic.

===LED daytime running lights===
Beginning in 2005, Audi has implemented white LED technology as daytime running lights (DRL) in their products. The distinctive shape of the DRLs has become a trademark of sorts. LEDs were first introduced on the Audi A8 W12, the world&#x27;s first production car to have LED DRLs, and have since spread throughout the entire model range. The LEDs are present on some Audi billboards.

Since 2010, Audi has also offered the LED technology in low- and high-beam headlights.

===Multi Media Interface===

Starting with the 2003 Audi A8, Audi has used a centralised control interface for its on-board infotainment systems, called Multi Media Interface (MMI). It is essentially a rotating control knob and &#x27;segment&#x27; buttons—designed to control all in-car entertainment devices (radio, CD changer, iPod, TV tuner), satellite navigation, heating and ventilation, and other car controls with a screen.

The availability of MMI has gradually filtered down the Audi lineup, and following its introduction on the third generation A3 in 2011, MMI is now available across the entire range. It has been generally well received, as it requires less menu-surfing with its segment buttons around a central knob, along with &#x27;main function&#x27; direct access buttons—with shortcuts to the radio or phone functions. The colour screen is mounted on the upright dashboard, and on the A4 (new), A5, A6, A8, and Q7, the controls are mounted horizontally.

=== Synthetic fuels ===

Audi has assisted with technology to produce synthetic diesel from water and carbon dioxide. Audi calls the synthetic diesel E-diesel. It is also working on synthetic gasoline (which it calls E-gasoline).

=== Logistics ===
Audi uses scanning gloves for parts registration during assembly, and automatic robots to transfer cars from factory to rail cars.

==Models==
===Current model range===
The following tables list Audi production vehicles that are sold as of 2025:



===S and RS models===


===Electric vehicles===

Audi is planning an alliance with the Japanese electronics giant Sanyo to develop a pilot hybrid electric project for the Volkswagen Group. The alliance could result in Sanyo batteries and other electronic components being used in future models of the Volkswagen Group. Concept electric vehicles unveiled to date include the Audi A1 Sportback Concept, Audi A4 TDI Concept E, and the fully electric Audi e-tron Concept Supercar.

=== Self-driving cars ===
In December 2018, Audi announced to invest 14 billion Euro ($15.9 billion) in e-mobility, self-driving cars.

==Production figures==
* Data from 1998 to 2010. Figures for different body types/versions of models have been merged to create overall figures for each model.

==Motorsport==
Audi has competed in various forms of motorsports. Audi&#x27;s tradition in motorsport began with their former company Auto Union in the 1930s. In the 1990s, Audi found success in the Touring and Super Touring categories of motor racing after success in circuit racing in North America.

===Rallying===
In 1980, Audi released the Quattro, a four-wheel drive (4WD) turbocharged car that went on to win rallies and races worldwide. It is considered one of the most significant rally cars of all time, because it was one of the first to take advantage of the then-recently changed rules which allowed the use of four-wheel drive in competition racing. Many critics doubted the viability of four-wheel drive racers, thinking them to be too heavy and complex, yet the Quattro was to become a successful car. It led its first rally before going off the road, however, the rally world had been served notice 4WD was the future. The Quattro went on to achieve much success in the World Rally Championship. It won the 1983 (Hannu Mikkola) and the 1984 (Stig Blomqvist) drivers&#x27; titles, and brought Audi the manufacturers&#x27; title in 1982 and 1984.
In 1984, Audi launched the short-wheelbase Sport Quattro which dominated rally races in Monte Carlo and Sweden, with Audi taking all podium places, but succumbed to problems further into WRC contention. In 1985, after another season mired in mediocre finishes, Walter Röhrl finished the season in his Sport Quattro S1, and helped place Audi second in the manufacturers&#x27; points. Audi also received rally honours in the Hong Kong to Beijing rally in that same year. Michèle Mouton, the only female driver to win a round of the World Rally Championship and a driver for Audi, took the Sport Quattro S1, now simply called the &quot;S1&quot;, and raced in the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb. The climb race pits a driver and car to drive to the summit of the Pikes Peak mountain in Colorado, and in 1985, Michèle Mouton set a new record of 11:25.39, and being the first woman to set a Pikes Peak record. In 1986, Audi formally left international rallying following an accident in Portugal involving driver Joaquim Santos in his Ford RS200. Santos swerved to avoid hitting spectators in the road, and left the track into the crowd of spectators on the side, killing three and injuring 30. Bobby Unser used an Audi in that same year to claim a new record for the Pikes Peak Hill Climb at 11:09.22.

In 1987, Walter Röhrl claimed the title for Audi setting a new Pikes Peak International Hill Climb record of 10:47.85 in his Audi S1, which he had retired from the WRC two years earlier. The Audi S1 employed Audi&#x27;s time-tested inline-five-cylinder turbocharged engine, with the final version generating . The engine was mated to a six-speed gearbox and ran on Audi&#x27;s famous four-wheel drive system. All of Audi&#x27;s top drivers drove this car; Hannu Mikkola, Stig Blomqvist, Walter Röhrl and Michèle Mouton. This Audi S1 started the range of Audi &#x27;S&#x27; cars, which now represents an increased level of sports-performance equipment within the mainstream Audi model range.

===In the United States===
As Audi moved away from rallying and into circuit racing, they chose to move first into America with the Trans-Am in 1988.

In 1989, Audi moved to International Motor Sports Association (IMSA) GTO with the Audi 90, however as they avoided the two major endurance events (Daytona and Sebring) despite winning on a regular basis, they would lose out on the title.

===Touring cars===
In 1990, having completed their objective to market cars in North America, Audi returned to Europe, turning first to the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft (DTM) series with the Audi V8, and then in 1993, being unwilling to build cars for the new formula, they turned their attention to the fast-growing Super Touring series, which are a series of national championships. Audi first entered in the French Supertourisme and Italian Superturismo. In the following year, Audi would switch to the German Super Tourenwagen Cup (known as STW), and then to British Touring Car Championship (BTCC) the year after that.

The Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA), having difficulty regulating the quattro four-wheel drive system, and the impact it had on the competitors, would eventually ban all four-wheel drive cars from competing in the series in 1998, but by then, Audi switched all their works efforts to sports car racing.

By 2000, Audi would still compete in the US with their RS4 for the SCCA Speed World GT Challenge, through dealer/team Champion Racing competing against Corvettes, Vipers, and smaller BMWs (where it is one of the few series to permit 4WD cars). In 2003, Champion Racing entered an RS6. Once again, the quattro four-wheel drive was superior, and Champion Audi won the championship. They returned in 2004 to defend their title, but a newcomer, Cadillac with the new Omega Chassis CTS-V, gave them a run for their money. After four victories in a row, the Audis were sanctioned with several negative changes that deeply affected the car&#x27;s performance. Namely, added ballast weights, and Champion Audi deciding to go with different tyres, and reducing the boost pressure of the turbocharger.

In 2004, after years of competing with the TT-R in the revitalised DTM series, with privateer team Abt Racing/Christian Abt taking the 2002 title with Laurent Aïello, Audi returned as a full factory effort to touring car racing by entering two factory-supported Joest Racing A4 DTM cars.

===24 Hours of Le Mans===


Audi began racing prototype sportscars in 1999, debuting at the Le Mans 24 hour. Two car concepts were developed and raced in their first season - the Audi R8R (open-cockpit &#x27;roadster&#x27; prototype) and the Audi R8C (closed-cockpit &#x27;coupé&#x27; GT-prototype). The R8R scored a credible podium on its racing debut at Le Mans and was the concept which Audi continued to develop into the 2000 season due to favourable rules for open-cockpit prototypes.

However, most of the competitors (such as BMW, Toyota, Mercedes and Nissan) retired at the end of 1999.
The factory-supported Joest Racing team won at Le Mans three times in a row with the Audi R8 (2000–2002), as well as winning every race in the American Le Mans Series in its first year. Audi also sold the car to customer teams such as Champion Racing.

In 2003, two Bentley Speed 8s, with engines designed by Audi, and driven by Joest drivers &quot;loaned&quot; to the fellow Volkswagen Group company, competed in the GTP class, and finished the race in the top two positions, while the Champion Racing R8 finished third overall, and first in the LMP900 class. Audi returned to the winner&#x27;s podium at the 2004 race, with the top three finishers all driving R8s: Audi Sport Japan Team Goh finished first, Audi Sport UK Veloqx second, and Champion Racing third.

At the 2005 24 Hours of Le Mans, Champion Racing entered two R8s, along with an R8 from the Audi PlayStation Team Oreca. The R8s (which were built to old LMP900 regulations) received a narrower air inlet restrictor, reducing power, and an additional of weight compared to the newer LMP1 chassis. On average, the R8s were about 2–3 seconds off pace compared to the Pescarolo–Judd. But with a team of excellent drivers and experience, both Champion R8s were able to take first and third, while the Oreca team took fourth. The Champion team was also the first American team to win Le Mans since the Gulf Ford GTs in 1967. This also ends the long era of the R8; however, its replacement for 2006, called the Audi R10 TDI, was unveiled on 13 December 2005.

The R10 TDI employed many new and innovative features, the most notable being the twin-turbocharged direct injection diesel engine. It was first raced in the 2006 12 Hours of Sebring as a race-test in preparation for the 2006 24 Hours of Le Mans, which it later went on to win. Audi had a win in the first diesel sports car at 12 Hours of Sebring (the car was developed with a Diesel engine due to ACO regulations that favor diesel engines). As well as winning the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 2006, the R10 TDI beat the Peugeot 908 HDi FAP in , and in , (however Peugeot won the 24h in 2009) with a podium clean-sweep (all four 908 entries retired) while breaking a distance record (set by the Porsche 917K of Martini Racing in ), in with the R15 TDI Plus.

Audi&#x27;s sports car racing success would continue with the Audi R18&#x27;s victory at the 2011 24 Hours of Le Mans. Audi Sport Team Joest&#x27;s Benoît Tréluyer earned Audi their first pole position in five years while the team&#x27;s sister car locked out the front row. Early accidents eliminated two of Audi&#x27;s three entries, but the sole remaining Audi R18 TDI of Tréluyer, Marcel Fässler, and André Lotterer held off the trio of Peugeot 908s to claim victory by a margin of 13.8 seconds.

Audi entered a factory racing team run by Joest Racing into the American Le Mans Series under the Audi Sport North America name in 2000. This was a successful operation with the team winning on its debut in the series at the 2000 12 Hours of Sebring. Factory-backed Audi R8s were the dominant car in ALMS taking 25 victories between 2000 and the end of the 2002 season. In 2003, Audi sold customer cars to Champion Racing as well as continuing to race the factory Audi Sport North America team. Champion Racing won many races as a private team running Audi R8s and eventually replaced Team Joest as the Audi Sport North America between 2006 and 2008. Since 2009 Audi has not taken part in full American Le Mans Series Championships, but has competed in the series opening races at Sebring, using the 12-hour race as a test for Le Mans, and also as part of the 2012 FIA World Endurance Championship season calendar.

===European Le Mans Series===
Audi participated in the 2003 1000km of Le Mans which was a one-off sports car race in preparation for the 2004 European Le Mans Series. The factory team Audi Sport UK won races and the championship in the 2004 season but Audi was unable to match their sweeping success of Audi Sport North America in the American Le Mans Series, partly due to the arrival of a factory competitor in LMP1, Peugeot. The French manufacturer&#x27;s 908 HDi FAP became the car to beat in the series from 2008 onwards with 20 LMP wins. However, Audi were able to secure the championship in 2008 even though Peugeot scored more race victories in the season.

===World Endurance Championship===
====2012====
In 2012, the FIA sanctioned a World Endurance Championship which would be organised by the ACO as a continuation of the ILMC. Audi competed won the first WEC race at Sebring and followed this up with a further three successive wins, including the 2012 24 Hours of Le Mans. Audi scored a final 5th victory in the 2012 WEC in Bahrain and were able to win the inaugural WEC Manufacturers&#x27; Championship.

====2013====
As defending champions, Audi once again entered the Audi R18 e-tron quattro chassis into the 2013 WEC and the team won the first five consecutive races, including the 2013 24 Hours of Le Mans. The victory at Round 5, Circuit of the Americas, was of particular significance as it marked the 100th win for Audi in Le Mans prototypes. Audi secured their second consecutive WEC Manufacturers&#x27; Championship at Round 6 after taking second place and half points in the red-flagged Fuji race.

====2014====
For the 2014 season, Audi entered a redesigned and upgraded R18 e-tron quattro which featured a 2 MJ energy recovery system. As defending champions, Audi would once again face a challenge in LMP1 from Toyota, and additionally from Porsche who returned to endurance racing after a 16-year absence. The season-opening 6hrs of Silverstone was a disaster for Audi who saw both cars retire from the race, marking the first time that an Audi car has failed to score a podium in a World Endurance Championship race. The team won two races and finished second in the manufacturers&#x27; championship.

====2015====
Audi won the first two races of the season, but thereafter failed to win again, finishing second in the manufacturers&#x27; championship.

===Formula E===

Audi provided factory support to Abt Sportsline in the FIA Formula E Championship, The team competed under the title of Audi Sport Abt Formula E Team in the inaugural 2014-15 Formula E season. On 13 February 2014 the team announced its driver line up as Daniel Abt and World Endurance Championship driver Lucas di Grassi.

Audi had left Formula E after the 2020-21 Formula E season. Audi continued to provide their powertrain to Envision Racing for the 2021-22 Formula E season. Through the seven seasons in Formula E, Audi secured 14 victories, one Drivers&#x27; Champion with Lucas di Grassi and one Teams&#x27; Champion.

===Formula One===

Audi has been linked to Formula One in recent years but has always resisted due to the company&#x27;s opinion that it is not relevant to road cars, but hybrid power unit technology has been adopted into the sport, swaying the company&#x27;s view and encouraging research into the program by former Ferrari team principal Stefano Domenicali.

Audi announced in August 2022 that it would enter the Championship as an engine manufacturer in . In October, Audi confirmed its partnership with Sauber Motorsport for the year 2026, acquiring a stake in the company for the German brand to enter the competition by renaming the team and supplying engines.

On 26 April 2024, Sauber announced they had signed Nico Hülkenberg for onwards on a multi-year contract, confirming him as their first driver in Formula One. Six months later, they confirmed that his teammate would be rookie Gabriel Bortoleto, the two replacing outgoing drivers Valtteri Bottas and Zhou Guanyu.

==Marketing==

===Branding===


The Audi emblem is four overlapping rings that represent the four marques of Auto Union. The Audi emblem symbolises the amalgamation of Audi with DKW, Horch and Wanderer: the first ring from the left represents Audi, the second represents DKW, third is Horch, and the fourth and last ring Wanderer. The design is popularly believed to have been the idea of Klaus von Oertzen, the director of sales at Wanderer—when Berlin was chosen as the host city for the 1936 Summer Olympics and that a form of the Olympic logo symbolized the newly established Auto Union&#x27;s desire to succeed. Somewhat ironically, the International Olympic Committee later sued Audi in the International Trademark Court in 1995, where they lost.

The original &quot;Audi&quot; script, with the distinctive slanted tails on the &quot;A&quot; and &quot;d&quot; was created for the historic Audi company in 1920 by the famous graphic designer Lucian Bernhard, and was resurrected when Volkswagen revived the brand in 1965. Following the demise of NSU in 1977, less prominence was given to the four rings, in preference to the &quot;Audi&quot; script encased within a black (later red) ellipse, and was commonly displayed next to the Volkswagen roundel when the two brands shared a dealer network under the V.A.G banner. The ellipse (known as the Audi Oval) was phased out after 1994, when Audi formed its own independent dealer network, and prominence was given back to the four rings—at the same time Audi Sans (a derivative of Univers) was adopted as the font for all marketing materials, corporate communications and was also used in the vehicles themselves.

As part of Audi&#x27;s centennial celebration in 2009, the company updated the logo, changing the font to left-aligned Audi Type, and altering the shading for the overlapping rings. The revised logo was designed by Rayan Abdullah.

Audi developed a Corporate Sound concept, with Audi Sound Studio designed for producing the Corporate Sound. The Corporate Sound project began with sound agency Klangerfinder GmbH &amp; Co KG and s12 GmbH. Audio samples were created in Klangerfinder&#x27;s sound studio in Stuttgart, becoming part of Audi Sound Studio collection. Other Audi Sound Studio components include The Brand Music Pool, The Brand Voice. Audi also developed Sound Branding Toolkit including certain instruments, sound themes, rhythm and car sounds which all are supposed to reflect the AUDI sound character.

Audi started using a beating heart sound trademark beginning in 1996. An updated heartbeat sound logo, developed by agencies KLANGERFINDER GmbH &amp; Co KG of Stuttgart and S12 GmbH of Munich, was first used in 2010 in an Audi A8 commercial with the slogan &quot;The Art of Progress&quot;.

====Slogans====
Audi&#x27;s corporate tagline is , meaning &#x27;Progress through Technology&#x27;. The German-language tagline is used in many European countries, including the United Kingdom (but not in Italy, where is used), and in other markets, such as Latin America, Oceania, Africa and parts of Asia including Japan. Originally, the American tagline was &quot;Innovation through technology&quot;, but in Canada &quot;Vorsprung durch Technik&quot; was used. Since 2007, Audi has used the slogan &quot;Truth in Engineering&quot; in the U.S. However, since the Audi emissions testing scandal came to light in September 2015, this slogan was lambasted for being discordant with reality. In fact, just hours after disgraced Volkswagen CEO Martin Winterkorn admitted to cheating on emissions data, an advertisement during the 2015 Primetime Emmy Awards promoted Audi&#x27;s latest advances in low emissions technology with Kermit the Frog stating, &quot;It&#x27;s not that easy being green.&quot;

&quot;Vorsprung durch Technik&quot; was first used in English-language advertising after Sir John Hegarty of the Bartle Bogle Hegarty advertising agency visited the Audi factory in 1982. In the original British television commercials, the phrase was voiced by Geoffrey Palmer. After its repeated use in advertising campaigns, the phrase found its way into popular culture, including the British comedy &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;, the U2 song &quot;Zooropa&quot; and the &quot;Blur&quot; song &quot;Parklife&quot;. Similar-sounding phrases have also been used, including as the punchline for a joke in the movie &quot;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&quot; and in the British TV series &quot;Peep Show&quot;.

====Typography====
Audi Sans (based on Univers Extended) was originally created in 1997 by Ole Schäfer for MetaDesign. MetaDesign was later commissioned for a new corporate typeface called Audi Type, designed by Paul van der Laan and Pieter van Rosmalen of Bold Monday. The font began to appear in Audi&#x27;s 2009 products and marketing materials.

===Sponsorships===

Audi is a strong partner of different kinds of sports. In football, long partnerships exist between Audi and domestic clubs including Bayern Munich, Hamburger SV, 1. FC Nürnberg, Hertha BSC, and Borussia Mönchengladbach and international clubs including Chelsea, Real Madrid, FC Barcelona, A.C. Milan, AFC Ajax and Perspolis. Audi also sponsors winter sports: The Audi FIS Alpine Ski World Cup is named after the company. Additionally, Audi supports the German Ski Association (DSV) as well as the alpine skiing national teams of Switzerland, Sweden, Finland, France, Liechtenstein, Italy, Austria and the U.S. For almost two decades, Audi fosters golf sport: for example with the Audi quattro Cup and the HypoVereinsbank Ladies German Open presented by Audi. In sailing, Audi is engaged in the Medcup regatta and supports the team Luna Rossa during the Louis Vuitton Pacific Series and also is the primary sponsor of the Melges 20 sailboat. Further, Audi sponsors the regional teams ERC Ingolstadt (hockey) and FC Ingolstadt 04 (soccer). In 2009, the year of Audi&#x27;s 100th anniversary, the company organized the Audi Cup for the first time. Audi also sponsor the New York Yankees as well. In October 2010 they agreed to a three sponsorship year-deal with Everton. Audi also sponsors the England Polo Team and holds the Audi Polo Awards.

====Marvel Cinematic Universe====
Since the start of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Audi signed a deal to sponsor, promote and provide vehicles for several films. So far these have been, &quot;Iron Man&quot;, &quot;Iron Man 2&quot;, &quot;Iron Man 3&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot;, &quot;Spider-Man: Homecoming&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man: Far From Home&quot;. The R8 supercar became the personal vehicle for Tony Stark (played by Robert Downey Jr.) for six of these films. The e-tron vehicles were promoted in &quot;Endgame&quot; and &quot;Far From Home&quot;. Several commercials were co-produced by Marvel and Audi to promote several new concepts and some of the latest vehicles such as the A8, SQ7 and the e-Tron fleet.

===Multitronic campaign===
In 2001, Audi promoted the new multitronic continuously variable transmission with television commercials throughout Europe, featuring an impersonator of musician and actor Elvis Presley. A prototypical dashboard figure—later named &quot;Wackel-Elvis&quot; (&quot;Wobble Elvis&quot; or &quot;Wobbly Elvis&quot;)—appeared in the commercials to demonstrate the smooth ride in an Audi equipped with the multitronic transmission. The dashboard figure was originally intended for use in the commercials only, but after they aired the demand for Wackel-Elvis fans grew among fans and the figure was mass-produced in China and marketed by Audi in their factory outlet store.

===Audi TDI===
As part of Audi&#x27;s attempt to promote its Diesel technology in 2009, the company began Audi Mileage Marathon. The driving tour featured a fleet of 23 Audi TDI vehicles from 4 models (Audi Q7 3.0 TDI, Audi Q5 3.0 TDI, Audi A4 3.0 TDI, Audi A3 Sportback 2.0 TDI with S tronic transmission) travelling across the American continent from New York to Los Angeles, passing major cities like Chicago, Dallas and Las Vegas during the 13 daily stages, as well as natural wonders including the Rocky Mountains, Death Valley and the Grand Canyon.

===Audi e-tron===
The next phase of technology Audi is developing is the e-tron electric drive powertrain system. They have shown several concept cars , each with different levels of size and performance. The original e-tron concept shown at the 2009 Frankfurt motor show is based on the platform of the R8 and has been scheduled for limited production. Power is provided by electric motors at all four wheels. The second concept was shown at the 2010 Detroit Motor Show. Power is provided by two electric motors at the rear axle. This concept is also considered to be the direction for a future mid-engined gas-powered 2-seat performance coupe. The Audi A1 e-tron concept, based on the Audi A1 production model, is a hybrid vehicle with a range extending Wankel rotary engine to provide power after the initial charge of the battery is depleted. It is the only concept of the three to have range-extending capability. The car is powered through the front wheels, always using electric power.

It is all set to be displayed at the Auto Expo 2012 in New Delhi, India, from 5 January. It is powered by a 1.4 litre engine, and can cover a distance up to 54 km on a single charge. The e-tron was also shown in the 2013 blockbuster film Iron Man 3 and was driven by Tony Stark (Iron Man).

=== Lawsuit on the use of the letter Q ===
In early 2005, Nissan North America Inc. filed a lawsuit against Audi over the use of the letter &quot;Q&quot; as a model name.

Audi is using the &quot;Q&quot; for the designation of their quattro four-wheel drive system, used in production cars for over twenty-five years (Audi&#x27;s Quattro trademark is actually an umbrella term for several types of four-wheel-drive systems developed by Torsen, Haldex Traction AB, and Borg-Warner, the latter being used in the Q7). Nissan&#x27;s Infiniti marque first used Q for their 1989 Infiniti Q45 flagship, but later expanded to its entire lineup, with Q for passenger cars (the Q30, Q40, Q50, and Q60) and QX for SUVs (the QX30, QX50, QX60, and QX70).

A settlement between Audi AG and Nissan was reached in late 2006. The agreement stipulates that Audi will only use the Q-prefix for three models, the Q3, Q5 and the Q7. Audi has since released other Q series cars as well, such as the Q2, Q6, and Q8.

===In video games===
Audi has supported the European version of PlayStation Home, the PlayStation 3&#x27;s online community-based service, by releasing a dedicated Home space. Audi is the first carmaker to develop such a space for Home. On 17 December 2009, Audi released two spaces; the Audi Home Terminal and the Audi Vertical Run. The Audi Home Terminal features an Audi TV channel delivering video content, an Internet Browser feature, and a view of a city. The Audi Vertical Run is where users can access the mini-game Vertical Run, a futuristic mini-game featuring Audi&#x27;s e-tron concept. Players collect energy and race for the highest possible speeds and the fastest players earn a place in the Audi apartments located in a large tower in the centre of the Audi Space. In both the Home Terminal and Vertical Run spaces, there are teleports where users can teleport back and forth between the two spaces. Audi had stated that additional content would be added in 2010. On 31 March 2015 Sony shutdown the PlayStation Home service rendering all content for it inaccessible.

<text>An aircraft (: aircraft) is a vehicle that is able to fly by gaining support from the air. It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or the dynamic lift of an airfoil, or, in a few cases, direct downward thrust from its engines. Common examples of aircraft include airplanes, rotorcraft, helicopters, airships (including blimps), gliders, paramotors, and hot air balloons. Part 1 (Definitions and Abbreviations) of Subchapter A of Chapter I of Title 14 of the U. S. Code of Federal Regulations states that aircraft &quot;means a device that is used or intended to be used for flight in the air.&quot;

The human activity that surrounds aircraft is called &quot;aviation&quot;. The science of aviation, including designing and building aircraft, is called &quot;aeronautics.&quot; Crewed aircraft are flown by an onboard pilot, whereas unmanned aerial vehicles may be remotely controlled or self-controlled by onboard computers. Aircraft may be classified by different criteria, such as lift type, aircraft propulsion (if any), usage and others.

== History ==

Flying model craft and stories of manned flight go back many centuries; however, the first manned ascent — and safe descent — in modern times took place by larger hot-air balloons developed in the 18th century. Each of the two World Wars led to great technical advances. Consequently, the history of aircraft can be divided into five eras:
* Pioneers of flight, from the earliest experiments to 1914
* First World War, 1914 to 1918
* Aviation in the interwar period, 1918 to 1939
* Second World War, 1939 to 1945
* Postwar era, also called the Jet Age, 1945 to the present day

== Methods of lift ==
=== Lighter-than-air ===

Lighter-than-air aircraft or &quot;aerostats&quot; use buoyancy to float in the air in much the same way that ships float on the water. They are characterized by one or more large cells or canopies, filled with a lifting gas such as helium, hydrogen or hot air, which is less dense than the surrounding air. When the weight of the lifting gas is added to the weight of the aircraft itself, it is same or less than the mass of the air that the craft displaces.

Small hot-air balloons, called sky lanterns, were first invented in ancient China prior to the 3rd century BC and used primarily in cultural celebrations, and were only the second type of aircraft to fly, the first being kites, which were also first invented in ancient China over two thousand years ago (see Han Dynasty).

A balloon was originally any aerostat, while the term airship was used for large, powered aircraft designs — usually fixed-wing. In 1919, Frederick Handley Page was reported as referring to &quot;ships of the air,&quot; with smaller passenger types as &quot;Air yachts.&quot; In the 1930s, large intercontinental flying boats were also sometimes referred to as &quot;ships of the air&quot; or &quot;flying-ships&quot;. — though none had yet been built. The advent of powered balloons, called dirigible balloons, and later of rigid hulls allowing a great increase in size, began to change the way these words were used. Huge powered aerostats, characterized by a rigid outer framework and separate aerodynamic skin surrounding the gas bags, were produced, the Zeppelins being the largest and most famous. There were still no fixed-wing aircraft or non-rigid balloons large enough to be called airships, so &quot;airship&quot; came to be synonymous with these aircraft. Then several accidents, such as the Hindenburg disaster in 1937, led to the demise of these airships. Nowadays a &quot;balloon&quot; is an unpowered aerostat and an &quot;airship&quot; is a powered one.

A powered, steerable aerostat is called a &quot;dirigible&quot;. Sometimes this term is applied only to non-rigid balloons, and sometimes &quot;dirigible balloon&quot; is regarded as the definition of an airship (which may then be rigid or non-rigid). Non-rigid dirigibles are characterized by a moderately aerodynamic gasbag with stabilizing fins at the back. These soon became known as &quot;blimps&quot;. During World War II, this shape was widely adopted for tethered balloons; in windy weather, this both reduces the strain on the tether and stabilizes the balloon. The nickname &quot;blimp&quot; was adopted along with the shape. In modern times, any small dirigible or airship is called a blimp, though a blimp may be unpowered as well as powered.

=== Heavier-than-air ===

Heavier-than-air aircraft or &quot;aerodynes&quot; are denser than air and thus must find some way to obtain enough lift that can overcome the aircraft&#x27;s weight. There are two ways to produce dynamic upthrust — aerodynamic lift by having air flowing past an aerofoil (such dynamic interaction of aerofoils with air is the origin of the term &quot;aerodyne&quot;), or powered lift in the form of reactional lift from downward engine thrust.

Aerodynamic lift involving wings is the most common, and can be achieved via two methods. Fixed-wing aircraft (airplanes and gliders) achieve airflow past the wings by having the entire aircraft moving forward through the air, while rotorcraft (helicopters and autogyros) do so by having mobile, elongated wings spinning rapidly around a mast in an assembly known as the rotor. As aerofoils, there must be air flowing over the wing to create pressure difference between above and below, thus generating upward lift over the entire wetted area of the wing. A &quot;flexible wing&quot; is a wing made of fabric or thin sheet material, often stretched over a rigid frame, similar to the flight membranes on many flying and gliding animals. A &quot;kite&quot; is tethered to the ground and relies on the speed of the wind over its wings, which may be flexible or rigid, fixed, or rotary.

With powered lift, the aircraft directs its engine thrust vertically downward. V/STOL aircraft, such as the Harrier jump jet and Lockheed Martin F-35B take off and land vertically using powered lift and transfer to aerodynamic lift in steady flight.

A pure rocket is not usually regarded as an aerodyne because its flight does not depend on interaction with the air at all (and thus can even fly in the vacuum of outer space); however, many aerodynamic lift vehicles have been powered or assisted by rocket motors. Rocket-powered missiles that obtain aerodynamic lift at very high speed due to airflow over their bodies are a marginal case.

==== Fixed-wing ====
The forerunner of the fixed-wing aircraft is the kite. Whereas a fixed-wing aircraft relies on its forward speed to create airflow over the wings, a kite is tethered to the ground and relies on the wind blowing over its wings to provide lift. Kites were the first kind of aircraft to fly and were invented in China around 500 BC. Much aerodynamic research was done with kites before test aircraft, wind tunnels, and computer modelling programs became available.

The first heavier-than-air craft capable of controlled free-flight were gliders. A glider designed by George Cayley carried out the first true manned, controlled flight in 1853. The first powered and controllable fixed-wing aircraft (the airplane or aeroplane) was invented by Wilbur and Orville Wright.

Besides the method of propulsion (if any), fixed-wing aircraft are in general characterized by their wing configuration. The most important wing characteristics are:
* Number of wings – Monoplane, biplane, triplane, or multiplane.
* Wing support – Braced or cantilever, rigid or flexible.
* Wing planform – including aspect ratio, angle of sweep, and any variations along the span (including the important class of delta wings).
* Location of the horizontal stabilizer, if any.
* Dihedral angle – positive, zero, or negative (anhedral).

A variable geometry aircraft can change its wing configuration during flight.

A flying wing has no fuselage, though it may have small blisters or pods. The opposite of this is a lifting body, which has no wings, though it may have small stabilizing and control surfaces.

Wing-in-ground-effect vehicles are generally not considered aircraft. They &quot;fly&quot; efficiently close to the surface of the ground or water, like conventional aircraft during takeoff. An example is the Russian ekranoplan nicknamed the &quot;Caspian Sea Monster&quot;. Man-powered aircraft also rely on ground effect to remain airborne with minimal pilot power, but this is only because they are so underpowered—in fact, the airframe is capable of flying higher.

==== Rotorcraft ====
Rotorcraft, or rotary-wing aircraft, use a spinning rotor with aerofoil cross-section blades (a &quot;rotary wing&quot;) to provide lift. Types include helicopters, autogyros, and various hybrids such as gyrodynes and compound rotorcraft.

&quot;Helicopters&quot; have a rotor turned by an engine-driven shaft. The rotor pushes air downward to create lift. By tilting the rotor forward, the downward flow is tilted backward, producing thrust for forward flight. Some helicopters have more than one rotor and a few have rotors turned by gas jets at the tips. Some have a tail rotor to counteract the rotation of the main rotor, and to aid directional control.

&quot;Autogyros&quot; have unpowered rotors, with a separate power plant to provide thrust. The rotor is tilted backward. As the autogyro moves forward, air blows upward across the rotor, making it spin. This spinning increases the speed of airflow over the rotor, to provide lift. Rotor kites are unpowered autogyros, which are towed to give them forward speed or tethered to a static anchor in high-wind for kited flight.

&quot;Compound rotorcraft&quot; have wings that provide some or all of the lift in forward flight. They are nowadays classified as &quot;powered lift&quot; types and not as rotorcraft. &quot;Tiltrotor&quot; aircraft (such as the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey), tiltwing, tail-sitter, and coleopter aircraft have their rotors/propellers horizontal for vertical flight and vertical for forward flight.

==== Other methods of lift ====
* A &quot;lifting body&quot; is an aircraft body shaped to produce lift. If there are any wings, they are too small to provide significant lift and are used only for stability and control. Lifting bodies are not efficient: they suffer from high drag, and must also travel at high speed to generate enough lift to fly. Many of the research prototypes, such as the Martin Marietta X-24, which led up to the Space Shuttle, were lifting bodies, though the Space Shuttle is not, and some supersonic missiles obtain lift from the airflow over a tubular body.
* &quot;Powered lift&quot; types rely on engine-derived lift for vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL). Most types transition to fixed-wing lift for horizontal flight. Classes of powered lift types include VTOL jet aircraft (such as the Harrier jump jet) and tiltrotors, such as the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey, among others. A few experimental designs rely entirely on engine thrust to provide lift throughout the whole flight, including personal fan-lift hover platforms and jetpacks. VTOL research designs include the Rolls-Royce Thrust Measuring Rig.
* Some rotor wings employ horizontal-axis wings, in which airflow across a spinning rotor generates lift. The &quot;Flettner airplane&quot; uses a rotating cylinder, obtaining lift from the Magnus effect. The FanWing uses a cross-flow fan, while the mechanically more complex &quot;cyclogyro&quot; comprises multiple wings which rotate together around a central axis.
* The &quot;ornithopter&quot; obtains thrust by flapping its wings.

== Size and speed extremes ==
=== Size ===

The smallest aircraft are toys/recreational items, and nano aircraft.

The largest aircraft by dimensions and volume (as of 2016) is the long British Airlander 10, a hybrid blimp, with helicopter and fixed-wing features, and reportedly capable of speeds up to , and an airborne endurance of two weeks with a payload of up to .

The largest aircraft by weight and largest regular fixed-wing aircraft ever built, , was the Antonov An-225 &quot;Mriya&quot;. That Soviet-built (Ukrainian SSR) six-engine transport of the 1980s was long, with an wingspan. It holds the world payload record, after transporting of goods, and has flown loads commercially. With a maximum loaded weight of , it was also the heaviest aircraft built to date. It could cruise at . The aircraft was destroyed during the Russo-Ukrainian War.

The largest military airplanes are the Ukrainian Antonov An-124 &quot;Ruslan&quot; (world&#x27;s second-largest airplane, also used as a civilian transport), and American Lockheed C-5 Galaxy transport, weighing, loaded, over . The 8-engine, piston/propeller Hughes H-4 &quot;Hercules&quot; &quot;Spruce Goose&quot; — an American World War II wooden flying boat transport with a greater wingspan (94m/260 ft) than any current aircraft and a tail height equal to the tallest (Airbus A380-800 at 24.1m/78 ft) — flew only one short hop in the late 1940s and never flew out of ground effect.

The largest civilian airplanes, apart from the above-noted An-225 and An-124, are the Airbus Beluga cargo transport derivative of the Airbus A300 jet airliner, the Boeing Dreamlifter cargo transport derivative of the Boeing 747 jet airliner/transport (the 747-200B was, at its creation in the 1960s, the heaviest aircraft ever built, with a maximum weight of over ), and the double-decker Airbus A380 &quot;super-jumbo&quot; jet airliner (the world&#x27;s largest passenger airliner).

=== Speeds ===

The fastest fixed-wing aircraft and fastest glider, is the Space Shuttle, which re-entered the atmosphere at nearly Mach 25 or 

The fastest recorded powered aircraft flight and fastest recorded aircraft flight of an air-breathing powered aircraft was of the NASA X-43A &quot;Pegasus&quot;, a scramjet-powered, hypersonic, lifting body experimental research aircraft, at Mach 9.68 or on 16 November 2004.

Prior to the X-43A, the fastest recorded powered airplane flight, and still the record for the fastest manned powered airplane, was the North American X-15, rocket-powered airplane at Mach 6.7 or 7,274 km/h (4,520 mph) on 3 October 1967.

The fastest manned, air-breathing powered airplane is the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird, a U.S. reconnaissance jet fixed-wing aircraft, having reached on 28 July 1976.

== Propulsion ==
=== Unpowered aircraft ===
Gliders are heavier-than-air aircraft that do not employ propulsion once airborne. Take-off may be by launching forward and downward from a high location, or by pulling into the air on a tow-line, either by a ground-based winch or vehicle, or by a powered &quot;tug&quot; aircraft. For a glider to maintain its forward air speed and lift, it must descend in relation to the air (but not necessarily in relation to the ground). Many gliders can &quot;soar&quot;, &quot;i.e.&quot;, gain height from updrafts such as thermal currents. The first practical, controllable example was designed and built by the British scientist and pioneer George Cayley, whom many recognise as the first aeronautical engineer. Common examples of gliders are sailplanes, hang gliders and paragliders.

Balloons drift with the wind, though normally the pilot can control the altitude, either by heating the air or by releasing ballast, giving some directional control (since the wind direction changes with altitude). A wing-shaped hybrid balloon can glide directionally when rising or falling; but a spherically shaped balloon does not have such directional control.

Kites are aircraft that are tethered to the ground or other object (fixed or mobile) that maintains tension in the tether or kite line; they rely on virtual or real wind blowing over and under them to generate lift and drag. Kytoons are balloon-kite hybrids that are shaped and tethered to obtain kiting deflections, and can be lighter-than-air, neutrally buoyant, or heavier-than-air.

=== Powered aircraft ===

Powered aircraft have one or more onboard sources of mechanical power, typically aircraft engines although rubber and manpower have also been used. Most aircraft engines are either lightweight reciprocating engines or gas turbines. Engine fuel is stored in tanks, usually in the wings but larger aircraft also have additional fuel tanks in the fuselage.

==== Propeller aircraft ====

Propeller aircraft use one or more propellers (airscrews) to create thrust in a forward direction. The propeller is usually mounted in front of the power source in &quot;tractor configuration&quot; but can be mounted behind in &quot;pusher configuration&quot;. Variations of propeller layout include &quot;contra-rotating propellers&quot; and &quot;ducted fans&quot;.

Many kinds of power plant have been used to drive propellers. Early airships used man power or steam engines. The more practical internal combustion piston engine was used for virtually all fixed-wing aircraft until World War II and is still used in many smaller aircraft. Some types use turbine engines to drive a propeller in the form of a turboprop or propfan. Human-powered flight has been achieved, but has not become a practical means of transport. Unmanned aircraft and models have also used power sources such as electric motors and rubber bands.

==== Jet aircraft ====

Jet aircraft use airbreathing jet engines, which take in air, burn fuel with it in a combustion chamber, and accelerate the exhaust rearwards to provide thrust.

Different jet engine configurations include the turbojet and turbofan, sometimes with the addition of an afterburner. Those with no rotating turbomachinery include the pulsejet and ramjet. These mechanically simple engines produce no thrust when stationary, so the aircraft must be launched to flying speed using a catapult, like the V-1 flying bomb, or a rocket, for example. Other engine types include the motorjet and the dual-cycle Pratt &amp; Whitney J58.

Compared to engines using propellers, jet engines can provide much higher thrust, higher speeds and, above about , greater efficiency. They are also much more fuel-efficient than rockets. As a consequence nearly all large, high-speed or high-altitude aircraft use jet engines.

==== Rotorcraft ====

Some rotorcraft, such as helicopters, have a powered rotary wing or &quot;rotor&quot;, where the rotor disc can be angled slightly forward so that a proportion of its lift is directed forwards. The rotor may, like a propeller, be powered by a variety of methods such as a piston engine or turbine. Experiments have also used jet nozzles at the rotor blade tips.

==== Other types of powered aircraft ====
* &quot;Rocket-powered aircraft&quot; have occasionally been experimented with, and the Messerschmitt Me 163 &quot;Komet&quot; fighter even saw action in the Second World War. Since then, they have been restricted to research aircraft, such as the North American X-15, which traveled up into space where air-breathing engines cannot work (rockets carry their own oxidant). Rockets have more often been used as a supplement to the main power plant, typically for the rocket-assisted take off of heavily loaded aircraft, but also to provide high-speed dash capability in some hybrid designs such as the Saunders-Roe SR.53.
* The &quot;ornithopter&quot; obtains thrust by flapping its wings.

== Design and construction ==
Aircraft are designed according to many factors such as customer and manufacturer demand, safety protocols and physical and economic constraints. For many types of aircraft the design process is regulated by national airworthiness authorities.

The key parts of an aircraft are generally divided into three categories:
* The &quot;structure&quot; (&quot;airframe&quot;) comprises the main load-bearing elements and associated equipment, as well as flight controls.
* The &quot;propulsion system&quot; (&quot;powerplant&quot;) (if it is powered) comprises the power source and associated equipment, as described above.
* The &quot;avionics&quot; comprise the electrical and electronic control, navigation and communication systems.

=== Structure ===
The approach to structural design varies widely between different types of aircraft. Some, such as paragliders, comprise only flexible materials that act in tension and rely on aerodynamic pressure to hold their shape. A balloon similarly relies on internal gas pressure, but may have a rigid basket or gondola slung below it to carry its payload. Early aircraft, including airships, often employed flexible doped aircraft fabric covering to give a reasonably smooth aeroshell stretched over a rigid frame. Later aircraft employed semi-monocoque techniques, where the skin of the aircraft is stiff enough to share much of the flight loads. In a true monocoque design there is no internal structure left.

The key structural parts of an aircraft depend on what type it is.

==== Aerostats ====

Lighter-than-air types are characterised by one or more gasbags, typically with a supporting structure of flexible cables or a rigid framework called its hull. Other elements such as engines or a gondola may also be attached to the supporting structure.

==== Aerodynes ====

Heavier-than-air types are characterised by one or more wings and a central fuselage. The fuselage typically also carries a tail or empennage for stability and control, and an undercarriage for takeoff and landing. Engines may be located on the fuselage or wings. On a fixed-wing aircraft the wings are rigidly attached to the fuselage, while on a rotorcraft the wings are attached to a rotating vertical shaft. Smaller designs sometimes use flexible materials for part or all of the structure, held in place either by a rigid frame or by air pressure. The fixed parts of the structure comprise the airframe.

=== Power ===

The source of motive power for an aircraft is normally called the &quot;powerplant,&quot; and includes engine or motor, propeller or rotor, (if any), jet nozzles and thrust reversers (if any), and accessories essential to the functioning of the engine or motor (e.g.: starter, ignition system, intake system, exhaust system, fuel system, lubrication system, engine cooling system, and engine controls).

Powered aircraft are typically powered by internal combustion engines (piston or turbine) burning fossil fuels—typically gasoline (avgas) or jet fuel. A very few are powered by rocket power, ramjet propulsion, or by electric motors, or by internal combustion engines of other types, or using other fuels. A very few have been powered, for short flights, by human muscle energy (e.g.: Gossamer Condor).

=== Avionics ===

The avionics comprise any &quot;electronic&quot; aircraft flight control systems and related equipment, including electronic cockpit instrumentation, navigation, radar, monitoring, and communications systems.

== Flight characteristics ==
=== Flight envelope ===

The flight envelope of an aircraft refers to its approved design capabilities in terms of airspeed, load factor and altitude. The term can also refer to other assessments of aircraft performance such as maneuverability. When an aircraft is abused, for instance by diving it at too-high a speed, it is said to be flown &quot;outside the envelope&quot;, something considered foolhardy since it has been taken beyond the design limits which have been established by the manufacturer. Going beyond the envelope may have a known outcome such as flutter or entry to a non-recoverable spin (possible reasons for the boundary).

=== Range ===
The range is the distance an aircraft can fly between takeoff and landing, as limited by the time it can remain airborne.

For a powered aircraft the time limit is determined by the fuel load and rate of consumption.

For an unpowered aircraft, the maximum flight time is limited by factors such as weather conditions and pilot endurance. Many aircraft types are restricted to daylight hours, while balloons are limited by their supply of lifting gas. The range can be seen as the average ground speed multiplied by the maximum time in the air.

The Airbus A350-900ULR is among the longest range airliners.

=== Flight dynamics ===
Flight dynamics is the science of air vehicle orientation and control in three dimensions. The three critical flight dynamics parameters are the angles of rotation around three axes which pass through the vehicle&#x27;s center of gravity, known as &quot;pitch&quot;, &quot;roll,&quot; and &quot;yaw&quot;.
* Roll is a rotation about the longitudinal axis (equivalent to the rolling or heeling of a ship) giving an up-down movement of the wing tips measured by the roll or bank angle.
* Pitch is a rotation about the sideways horizontal axis giving an up-down movement of the aircraft nose measured by the angle of attack.
* Yaw is a rotation about the vertical axis giving a side-to-side movement of the nose known as sideslip.

Flight dynamics is concerned with the stability and control of an aircraft&#x27;s rotation about each of these axes.

==== Stability ====

An aircraft that is unstable tends to diverge from its intended flight path and so is difficult to fly. A very stable aircraft tends to stay on its flight path and is difficult to maneuver. Therefore, it is important for any design to achieve the desired degree of stability. Since the widespread use of digital computers, it is increasingly common for designs to be inherently unstable and rely on computerised control systems to provide artificial stability.

A fixed wing is typically unstable in pitch, roll, and yaw. Pitch and yaw stabilities of conventional fixed wing designs require horizontal and vertical stabilisers, which act similarly to the feathers on an arrow. These stabilizing surfaces allow equilibrium of aerodynamic forces and to stabilise the flight dynamics of pitch and yaw. They are usually mounted on the tail section (empennage), although in the canard layout, the main aft wing replaces the canard foreplane as pitch stabilizer. Tandem wing and tailless aircraft rely on the same general rule to achieve stability, the aft surface being the stabilising one.

A rotary wing is typically unstable in yaw, requiring a vertical stabiliser.

A balloon is typically very stable in pitch and roll due to the way the payload is slung underneath the center of lift.

==== Control ====
Flight control surfaces enable the pilot to control an aircraft&#x27;s flight attitude and are usually part of the wing or mounted on, or integral with, the associated stabilizing surface. Their development was a critical advance in the history of aircraft, which had until that point been uncontrollable in flight.

Aerospace engineers develop control systems for a vehicle&#x27;s orientation (attitude) about its center of mass. The control systems include actuators, which exert forces in various directions, and generate rotational forces or moments about the aerodynamic center of the aircraft, and thus rotate the aircraft in pitch, roll, or yaw. For example, a pitching moment is a vertical force applied at a distance forward or aft from the aerodynamic center of the aircraft, causing the aircraft to pitch up or down. Control systems are also sometimes used to increase or decrease drag, for example to slow the aircraft to a safe speed for landing.

The two main aerodynamic forces acting on any aircraft are lift supporting it in the air and drag opposing its motion. Control surfaces or other techniques may also be used to affect these forces directly, without inducing any rotation.

== Environmental impact ==

Aircraft permit long distance, high speed travel and may be a more fuel efficient mode of transportation in some circumstances. Aircraft have environmental and climate impacts beyond fuel efficiency considerations, however. They are also relatively noisy compared to other forms of travel and high altitude aircraft generate contrails, which experimental evidence suggests may alter weather patterns.

== Uses for aircraft ==
Aircraft are produced in several different types optimized for various uses; military aircraft, which includes not just combat types but many types of supporting aircraft, and civil aircraft, which include all non-military types, experimental and model.

=== Military ===
A military aircraft is any aircraft that is operated by a legal or insurrectionary armed service of any type. Military aircraft can be either combat or non-combat:

* Combat aircraft are aircraft designed to destroy enemy equipment using its own armament. Combat aircraft divide broadly into fighters and bombers, with several in-between types, such as fighter-bombers and attack aircraft, including attack helicopters.
* Non-combat aircraft are not designed for combat as their primary function, but may carry weapons for self-defense. Non-combat roles include search and rescue, reconnaissance, observation, transport, training, and aerial refueling. These aircraft are often variants of civil aircraft.

Most military aircraft are powered heavier-than-air types. Other types, such as gliders and balloons, have also been used as military aircraft; for example, balloons were used for observation during the American Civil War and World War I, and military gliders were used during World War II to land troops.

=== Civil ===
Civil aircraft divide into &quot;commercial&quot; and &quot;general&quot; types, however there are some overlaps.

Commercial aircraft include types designed for scheduled and charter airline flights, carrying passengers, mail and other cargo. The larger passenger-carrying types are the airliners, the largest of which are wide-body aircraft. Some of the smaller types are also used in general aviation, and some of the larger types are used as VIP aircraft.

General aviation is a catch-all covering other kinds of private (where the pilot is not paid for time or expenses) and commercial use, and involving a wide range of aircraft types such as business jets (bizjets), trainers, homebuilt, gliders, warbirds and hot air balloons to name a few. The vast majority of aircraft today are general aviation types.

=== Experimental ===

An experimental aircraft is one that has not been fully proven in flight, or that carries a Special Airworthiness Certificate, called an Experimental Certificate in United States parlance. This often implies that the aircraft is testing new aerospace technologies, though the term also refers to amateur-built and kit-built aircraft, many of which are based on proven designs.
=== Model ===

A model aircraft is a small unmanned type made to fly for fun, for static display, for aerodynamic research or for other purposes. A scale model is a replica of some larger design.

<text>Alfred Bernhard Nobel ( ; ; 21 October 1833 – 10 December 1896) was a Swedish chemist, inventor, engineer and businessman. He is known for inventing dynamite as well as having bequeathed his fortune to establish the Nobel Prizes. He also made several other important contributions to science, holding 355 patents during his life.

Born into the prominent Nobel family in Stockholm, Nobel displayed an early aptitude for science and learning, particularly in chemistry and languages; he became fluent in six languages and filed his first patent at the age of 24. He embarked on many business ventures with his family, most notably owning the company Bofors, which was an iron and steel producer that he had developed into a major manufacturer of cannons and other armaments. Nobel&#x27;s most famous invention, dynamite, was an explosive using nitroglycerin that was patented in 1867. He further invented gelignite in 1875 and ballistite in 1887.

Upon his death, Nobel donated his fortune to a foundation to fund the Nobel Prizes, which annually recognize those who &quot;conferred the greatest benefit to humankind&quot;. The synthetic element nobelium was named after him, and his name and legacy also survive in companies such as Dynamit Nobel and AkzoNobel, which descend from mergers with companies he founded. Nobel was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which, pursuant to his will, would be responsible for choosing the Nobel laureates in physics and in chemistry.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===

Alfred Nobel was born in Stockholm, Sweden on 21 October 1833. He was the third son of Immanuel Nobel (1801–1872), an inventor and engineer, and Andriette Nobel (née Ahlsell 1805–1889). The couple married in 1827 and had eight children. The family was impoverished and only Alfred and his three brothers survived beyond childhood. Through his father, Alfred Nobel was a descendant of the Swedish scientist Olaus Rudbeck (1630–1702). Nobel&#x27;s father was an alumnus of Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm and was an engineer and inventor who built bridges and buildings and experimented with different ways of blasting rocks. He encouraged and taught Nobel from a young age.
Following various business failures caused by the loss of some barges of building material, Immanuel Nobel was forced into bankruptcy, Nobel&#x27;s father moved to Saint Petersburg, Russia, and grew successful there as a manufacturer of machine tools and explosives. He invented the veneer lathe, which made possible the production of modern plywood, and started work on the naval mine. In 1842, the family joined him in the city. Now prosperous, his parents were able to send Nobel to private tutors, and the boy excelled in his studies, particularly in chemistry and languages, achieving fluency in English, French, German, and Russian. For 18 months, from 1841 to 1842, Nobel attended the Jacobs Apologistic School in Stockholm, his only schooling; he never attended university.

Nobel gained proficiency in Swedish, French, Russian, English, German, and Italian. He also developed sufficient literary skill to write poetry in English. His &quot;Nemesis&quot; is a prose tragedy in four acts about the Italian noblewoman Beatrice Cenci. It was printed while he was dying, but the entire stock was destroyed immediately after his death except for three copies, being regarded as scandalous and blasphemous. It was published in Sweden in 2003 and has been translated into Slovenian, French, Italian, and Spanish.

===Scientific career===

As a young man, Nobel studied with chemist Nikolai Zinin; then, in 1850, went to Paris to further the work. There he met Ascanio Sobrero, who had synthesized nitroglycerin three years before. Sobrero strongly opposed the use of nitroglycerin because it was unpredictable, exploding when subjected to variable heat or pressure. But Nobel became interested in finding a way to control and use nitroglycerin as a commercially usable explosive; it had much more power than gunpowder. In 1851 at age 18, he went to the United States for one year to study, working for a short period under Swedish-American inventor John Ericsson, who designed the American Civil War ironclad, USS &quot;Monitor&quot;. Nobel filed his first patent, an English patent for a gas meter, in 1857, while his first Swedish patent, which he received in 1863, was on &quot;ways to prepare gunpowder&quot;. The family factory produced armaments for the Crimean War (1853–1856), but had difficulty switching back to regular domestic production when the fighting ended and they filed for bankruptcy. In 1859, Nobel&#x27;s father left his factory in the care of the second son, Ludvig Nobel (1831–1888), who greatly improved the business. Nobel and his parents returned to Sweden from Russia and Nobel devoted himself to the study of explosives, and especially to the safe manufacture and use of nitroglycerin. Nobel invented a detonator in 1863, and in 1865 designed the blasting cap. 

On 3 September 1864, a shed used for preparation of nitroglycerin exploded at the factory in Heleneborg, Stockholm, Sweden, killing five people, including Nobel&#x27;s younger brother Emil. He was then deprived of his license to produce explosives. Fazed by the accident, Nobel founded the company Nitroglycerin AB in Vinterviken so that he could continue to work in a more isolated area. Nobel invented dynamite in 1867, a substance easier and safer to handle than the more unstable nitroglycerin. Dynamite was patented in the US and the UK and was used extensively in mining and the building of transport networks internationally. In 1875, Nobel invented gelignite, more stable and powerful than dynamite, and in 1887, patented ballistite, a predecessor of cordite.

Nobel was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1884, the same institution that would later select laureates for two of the Nobel prizes, and he received an honorary doctorate from Uppsala University in 1893. Nobel&#x27;s brothers Ludvig and Robert founded the oil company Branobel and became hugely rich in their own right. Nobel invested in these and amassed great wealth through the development of these new oil regions. It operated mainly in Baku, Azerbaijan, but also in Cheleken, Turkmenistan. During his life, Nobel was issued 355 patents internationally, and by his death, his business had established more than 90 armaments factories, despite his apparently pacifist character.

===Inventions===

Nobel found that when nitroglycerin was incorporated in an absorbent inert substance like &quot;kieselguhr&quot; (diatomaceous earth) it became safer and more convenient to handle, and this mixture he patented in 1867 as &quot;dynamite&quot;. Nobel demonstrated his explosive for the first time that year, at a quarry in Redhill, Surrey, England. In order to help reestablish his name and improve the image of his business from the earlier controversies associated with dangerous explosives, Nobel had also considered naming the highly powerful substance &quot;Nobel&#x27;s Safety Powder&quot;, which is the text used in his patent, but settled with Dynamite instead, referring to the Greek word for &quot;power&quot; ().

Nobel later combined nitroglycerin with various nitrocellulose compounds, similar to collodion, but settled on a more efficient recipe combining another nitrate explosive, and obtained a transparent, jelly-like substance, which was a more powerful explosive than dynamite. Gelignite, or blasting gelatin, as it was named, was patented in 1876; and was followed by a host of similar combinations, modified by the addition of potassium nitrate and various other substances. Gelignite was more stable, powerful, transportable and conveniently formed to fit into bored holes, like those used in drilling and mining, than the previously used compounds. It was adopted as the standard technology for mining in the &quot;Age of Engineering&quot;, bringing Nobel a great amount of financial success, though at a cost to his health. An offshoot of this research resulted in Nobel&#x27;s invention of ballistite, the precursor of many modern smokeless powder explosives and still used as a rocket propellant.

===Nobel Prize===

There is a well known story about the origin of the Nobel Prize, although historians have been unable to verify it and some dismiss the story as a myth. In 1888, the death of his brother Ludvig supposedly caused several newspapers to publish obituaries of Alfred in error. One French newspaper condemned him for his invention of military explosives—in many versions of the story, dynamite is quoted, although this was mainly used for civilian applications—and this is said to have brought about his decision to leave a better legacy after his death. The obituary stated, &quot;&quot; (&quot;The merchant of death is dead&quot;), and went on to say, &quot;Dr. Alfred Nobel, who became rich by finding ways to kill more people faster than ever before, died yesterday.&quot; Nobel read the obituary and was appalled at the idea that he would be remembered in this way. His decision to posthumously donate the majority of his wealth to found the Nobel Prize has been credited to him wanting to leave behind a better legacy. However, it has been questioned whether or not the obituary in question actually existed.

On 27 November 1895, at the Swedish-Norwegian Club in Paris, Nobel signed his last will and testament and set aside the bulk of his estate to establish the Nobel Prizes, to be awarded annually without distinction of nationality. After taxes and bequests to individuals, Nobel&#x27;s will allocated 94% of his total assets, 31,225,000 Swedish kronor, to establish the five Nobel Prizes. By 2022, the foundation had approximately 6 billion Swedish Kronor of invested capital.

The first three of these prizes are awarded for eminence in physical science, in chemistry and in medical science or physiology; the fourth is for literary work &quot;in an ideal direction&quot; and the fifth prize is to be given to the person or society that renders the greatest service to the cause of international , in the suppression or reduction of standing armies, or in the establishment or furtherance of peace congresses.

The formulation for the literary prize being given for a work &quot;in an ideal direction&quot; (&#x27; in Swedish), is cryptic and has caused much confusion. For many years, the Swedish Academy interpreted &quot;ideal&quot; as &quot;idealistic&quot; (&#x27;) and used it as a reason not to give the prize to important but less romantic authors, such as Henrik Ibsen and Leo Tolstoy. This interpretation has since been revised, and the prize has been awarded to, for example, Dario Fo and José Saramago, who do not belong to the camp of literary idealism.

There was room for interpretation by the bodies he had named for deciding on the physical sciences and chemistry prizes, given that he had not consulted them before making the will. In his one-page testament, he stipulated that the money go to discoveries or inventions in the physical sciences and to discoveries or improvements in chemistry. He had opened the door to technological awards, but had not left instructions on how to deal with the distinction between science and technology. Since the deciding bodies he had chosen were more concerned with the former, the prizes went to scientists more often than engineers, technicians or other inventors.

Sweden&#x27;s central bank Sveriges Riksbank celebrated its 300th anniversary in 1968 by donating a large sum of money to the Nobel Foundation to be used to set up a sixth prize in the field of economics in honor of Alfred Nobel. In 2001, Alfred Nobel&#x27;s great-great-nephew, Peter Nobel (born 1931), asked the Bank of Sweden to differentiate its award to economists given &quot;in Alfred Nobel&#x27;s memory&quot; from the five other awards. This request added to the controversy over whether the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel is actually a legitimate &quot;Nobel Prize&quot;.

===Health issues and death===

In his letters to his mistress, Hess, Nobel described constant pain, debilitating migraines, and &quot;paralyzing&quot; fatigue, leading some to believe that he suffered from fibromyalgia. However, his concerns at the time were dismissed as hypochondria, leading to further depression.

By 1895, Nobel had developed angina pectoris.

On 27 November 1895, he finalized his will and testament, leaving most of his wealth in trust, unbeknownst to his family, to fund the Nobel Prize awards.

On 10 December 1896, he suffered a stroke/intracerebral hemorrhage and was first partially paralyzed and then died, aged 63. He is buried in Norra begravningsplatsen in Stockholm.

Based on his experimentation with explosives, his strenuous work habit, and the decline in his health at the end of the 1870s, some hypothesize that nitroglycerine poisoning was a contributing factor to his death.

==Personal life==
=== Religion ===
Nobel was Lutheran and, during his years living in Paris, he regularly attended the Church of Sweden Abroad led by pastor Nathan Söderblom who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1930. He was an agnostic in youth and became an atheist later in life, though he still donated generously to the Church.

===Romantic relationships and personality===
Nobel remained a solitary character, given to periods of depression. He never married, although his biographers note that he had at least three loves. His first love was in Russia with a girl named Alexandra who rejected his marriage proposal.

In 1876, Austro-Bohemian Countess Bertha von Suttner became his secretary, but she left him after a brief stay to marry her previous lover Baron Arthur Gundaccar von Suttner. Her contact with Nobel was brief, yet she corresponded with him until his death in 1896, and probably influenced his decision to include the Nobel Peace Prize in his will. She was awarded the 1905 Nobel Peace prize &quot;for her sincere peace activities&quot;.

Nobel&#x27;s longest-lasting romance was an 18-year relationship with Sofija Hess from Celje whom he met in 1876 in Baden bei Wien, where she worked as an employee in a flower shop that catered to wealthy clientele. The extent of their relationship was revealed by a collection of 221 letters sent by Nobel to Hess over 15 years. At the time that they met, Nobel was 43 years old while Hess was 26. Their relationship, which was not merely platonic, ended when she became pregnant from another man, although Nobel continued to support her financially until Hess married her child&#x27;s father to avoid being ostracized as a whore. Hess was a Jewish Christian and the letters include remarks by Nobel characterized as antisemitism. Nobel also displayed characteristics of chauvinism in the letters writing to Hess: &quot;You neither work, nor write, nor read, nor think&quot; and guilted her, writing &quot;I have for years now sacrificed out of purely noble motives my time, my duties, my intellectual life, my reputation&quot;.

===Residences===

Nobel traveled for much of his business life, maintaining companies in Europe and America. From 1865 to 1873, Nobel lived in Krümmel (now in the municipality of Geesthacht, near Hamburg). From 1873 to 1891, he lived in a house in the Avenue Malakoff in Paris.

In 1891, after being accused of high treason against France for selling Ballistite to Italy, he moved from Paris to Sanremo, Italy, acquiring Villa Nobel, overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, where he died in 1896.

In 1894, when he acquired Bofors-Gullspång, the Björkborn Manor was included, where he stayed during the summers. It is now a museum.

==Monument to Alfred Nobel==
The &quot;Monument to Alfred Nobel&quot; (, ) is in Saint Petersburg along the Bolshaya Nevka River on Petrogradskaya Embankment, the street where Nobel&#x27;s family lived until 1859. It was dedicated in 1991 to mark the 90th anniversary of the first Nobel Prize presentation. Diplomat Thomas Bertelman and Professor Arkady Melua were initiators of the creation of the monument in 1989 and they provided funds for the establishment of the monument. The abstract metal sculpture was designed by local artists Sergey Alipov and Pavel Shevchenko, and appears to be an explosion or branches of a tree.

==Criticism==
Criticism of Nobel focuses on his leading role in weapons manufacturing and sales. Some people question his motives in creating his prizes, suggesting they are intended to improve his reputation.

===Antisemitism===
Nobel has also been criticized for displays of antisemitism. In his letters to Hess, he wrote &quot;In my experience, [Jews] never do anything out of good will. They act merely out of selfishness or a desire to show off ... among selfish and inconsiderate people they are the most selfish and inconsiderate... all others exist to be fleeced.&quot;
