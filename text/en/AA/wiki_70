<text>Robert James Lee Hawke (9 December 1929 – 16 May 2019) was an Australian politician and trade unionist who served as the 23rd prime minister of Australia from 1983 to 1991. He held office as the leader of the Australian Labor Party (ALP), having previously served as the president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions from 1969 to 1980 and president of the Labor Party national executive from 1973 to 1978.

Hawke was born in Border Town, South Australia. He attended the University of Western Australia and went on to study at University College, Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar. In 1956, Hawke joined the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) as a research officer. Having risen to become responsible for national wage case arbitration, he was elected as president of the ACTU in 1969, where he achieved a high public profile. In 1973, he was appointed as president of the Labor Party.

In 1980, Hawke stood down from his roles as ACTU and Labor Party president to announce his intention to enter parliamentary politics, and was subsequently elected to the Australian House of Representatives as a member of parliament (MP) for the division of Wills at the 1980 federal election. Three years later, he was elected unopposed to replace Bill Hayden as leader of the Australian Labor Party, and within five weeks led Labor to a landslide victory at the 1983 election, and was sworn in as prime minister. He led Labor to victory a further three times, with successful outcomes in 1984, 1987 and 1990 elections, making him the most electorally successful prime minister in the history of the Labor Party.

The Hawke government implemented a significant number of reforms, including major economic reforms, the establishment of Landcare, the introduction of the universal healthcare scheme Medicare, brokering the Prices and Incomes Accord, creating APEC, floating the Australian dollar, deregulating the financial sector, introducing the Family Assistance Scheme, enacting the Sex Discrimination Act to prevent discrimination in the workplace, declaring &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot; as the country&#x27;s national anthem, initiating superannuation pension schemes for all workers, negotiating a ban on mining in Antarctica and overseeing passage of the Australia Act that removed all remaining jurisdiction by the United Kingdom from Australia.

In June 1991, Hawke faced a leadership challenge by the Treasurer, Paul Keating, but Hawke managed to retain power; however, Keating mounted a second challenge six months later, and won narrowly, replacing Hawke as prime minister. Hawke subsequently retired from parliament, pursuing both a business career and a number of charitable causes, until his death in 2019, aged 89. Hawke remains his party&#x27;s longest-serving Prime Minister, and Australia&#x27;s third-longest-serving prime minister behind Robert Menzies and John Howard. He is also the only prime minister to be born in South Australia and the only one raised and educated in Western Australia. Hawke holds the highest-ever approval rating for an Australian prime minister, reaching 75% approval in 1984. Hawke is frequently ranked within the upper tier of Australian prime ministers by historians.

==Early life and family==

Bob Hawke was born on 9 December 1929 in Border Town, South Australia, the second child of Arthur &quot;Clem&quot; Hawke (1898–1989), a Congregationalist minister, and his wife Edith Emily (Lee) (1897–1979) (known as Ellie), a schoolteacher. His uncle, Bert, was the Labor premier of Western Australia between 1953 and 1959.

Hawke&#x27;s brother Neil, who was seven years his senior, died at the age of seventeen after contracting meningitis, for which there was no cure at the time. Ellie Hawke subsequently developed an almost messianic belief in her son&#x27;s destiny, and this contributed to Hawke&#x27;s supreme self-confidence throughout his career. At the age of fifteen, he presciently boasted to friends that he would one day become the prime minister of Australia.

At the age of seventeen, Hawke had a serious crash while riding his Panther motorcycle that left him in a critical condition for several days. This near-death experience acted as his catalyst, driving him to make the most of his talents and not let his abilities go to waste. He joined the Labor Party in 1947 at the age of eighteen.

==Education and early career==

Hawke was educated at West Leederville State School, Perth Modern School and the University of Western Australia, graduating in 1952 with Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws degrees. He was also president of the university&#x27;s guild during the same year. The following year, Hawke won a Rhodes Scholarship to attend University College, Oxford, where he began a Bachelor of Arts course in philosophy, politics and economics (PPE). He soon found he was covering much the same ground as he had in his education at the University of Western Australia, and transferred to a Bachelor of Letters course. He wrote his thesis on wage-fixing in Australia and successfully presented it in January 1956.

In 1956, Hawke accepted a scholarship to undertake doctoral studies in the area of arbitration law in the law department at the Australian National University in Canberra. Soon after his arrival at ANU, he became the students&#x27; representative on the University Council. A year later, he was recommended to the President of the ACTU to become a research officer, replacing Harold Souter who had become ACTU Secretary. The recommendation was made by Hawke&#x27;s mentor at ANU, H. P. Brown, who for a number of years had assisted the ACTU in national wage cases. Hawke decided to abandon his doctoral studies and accept the offer, moving to Melbourne with his wife Hazel.

===World record beer skol (scull)===
Hawke is well known for a &quot;world record&quot; allegedly achieved at Oxford University for a beer skol (scull) of a yard of ale in 11 seconds. The record is widely regarded as having been important to his career and ocker chic image. A 2023 article in the &quot;Journal of Australian Studies&quot; by C. J. Coventry concluded that Hawke&#x27;s achievement was &quot;possibly fabricated&quot; and &quot;cultural propaganda&quot; designed to make Hawke appealing to unionised workers and nationalistic middle-class voters. The article contends that &quot;its location and time remain uncertain; there are no known witnesses; the field of competition was exclusive and with no scientific accountability; the record was first published in a beer pamphlet; and Hawke&#x27;s recollections were unreliable.&quot;

==Australian Council of Trade Unions==

Not long after Hawke began work at the ACTU, he became responsible for the presentation of its annual case for higher wages to the national wages tribunal, the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. He was first appointed as an ACTU advocate in 1959. The 1958 case, under previous advocate R.L. Eggleston, had yielded only a five-shilling increase. The 1959 case found for a fifteen-shilling increase, and was regarded as a personal triumph for Hawke. He went on to attain such success and prominence in his role as an ACTU advocate that, in 1969, he was encouraged to run for the position of ACTU President, despite the fact that he had never held elected office in a trade union.

He was elected ACTU President in 1969 on a modernising platform by the narrow margin of 399 to 350, with the support of the left of the union movement, including some associated with the Communist Party of Australia. He later credited Ray Gietzelt, General Secretary of the FMWU, as the single most significant union figure in helping him achieve this outcome. Questioned after his election on his political stance, Hawke stated that &quot;socialist is not a word I would use to describe myself&quot;, saying instead his approach to politics was pragmatic. His commitment to the cause of Jewish Refuseniks purportedly led to a planned assassination attempt on Hawke by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and its Australian operative Munif Mohammed Abou Rish.
In 1971, Hawke along with other members of the ACTU requested that South Africa send a non-racially biased team for the rugby union tour, with the intention of unions agreeing not to serve the team in Australia. Prior to arrival, the Western Australian branch of the Transport Workers&#x27; Union, and the Barmaids&#x27; and Barmens&#x27; Union, announced that they would serve the team, which allowed the Springboks to land in Perth. The tour commenced on 26 June and riots occurred as anti-apartheid protesters disrupted games. Hawke and his family started to receive malicious mail and phone calls from people who thought that sport and politics should not mix. Hawke remained committed to the ban on apartheid teams and later that year, the South African cricket team was successfully denied and no apartheid team was to ever come to Australia again. It was this ongoing dedication to racial equality in South Africa that would later earn Hawke the respect and friendship of Nelson Mandela.

In industrial matters, Hawke continued to demonstrate a preference for, and considerable skill at, negotiation, and was generally liked and respected by employers as well as the unions he advocated for. As early as 1972, speculation began that he would seek to enter the Parliament of Australia and eventually run to become the Leader of the Australian Labor Party. But while his professional career continued successfully, his heavy drinking and womanising placed considerable strains on his family life.

In June 1973, Hawke was elected as the Federal President of the Labor Party. Two years later, when the Whitlam government was controversially dismissed by the Governor-General, Hawke showed an initial keenness to enter Parliament at the ensuing election. Harry Jenkins, the MP for Scullin, came under pressure to step down to allow Hawke to stand in his place, but he strongly resisted this push. Hawke eventually decided not to attempt to enter Parliament at that time, a decision he soon regretted. After Labor was defeated at the election, Whitlam initially offered the leadership to Hawke, although it was not within Whitlam&#x27;s power to decide who would succeed him. Despite not taking on the offer, Hawke remained influential, playing a key role in averting national strike action.

During the 1977 federal election, he emerged as a strident opponent of accepting Vietnamese boat people as refugees into Australia, stating that they should be subject to normal immigration requirements and should otherwise be deported. He further stated only refugees selected off-shore should be accepted.

Hawke resigned as President of the Labor Party in August 1978. Neil Batt was elected in his place. The strain of this period took its toll on Hawke and in 1979 he suffered a physical collapse. This shock led Hawke to publicly announce his alcoholism in a television interview, and that he would make a concerted—and ultimately successful—effort to overcome it. He was helped through this period by the relationship that he had established with writer Blanche d&#x27;Alpuget, who, in 1982, published a biography of Hawke. His popularity with the public was, if anything, enhanced by this period of rehabilitation, and opinion polling suggested that he was a more popular public figure than either Labor Leader Bill Hayden or Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser.

===Informer for the United States===
During the period of 1973 to 1979, Hawke acted as an informant for the United States government. According to Coventry, Hawke as concurrent leader of the ACTU and ALP informed the US of details surrounding labour disputes, especially those relating to American companies and individuals, such as union disputes with Ford Motor Company and the black ban of Frank Sinatra. The major industrial action taken against Sinatra came about because Sinatra had made sexist comments against female journalists. The dispute was the subject of the 2003 film &quot;The Night We Called It a Day&quot;.

Hawke was described by US diplomats as &quot;a bulwark against anti-American sentiment and resurgent communism during the economic turmoil of the 1970s&quot;, and often disputed with the Whitlam government over issues of foreign policy and industrial relations. US diplomats played a major role in shaping Hawke&#x27;s consensus politics and economics. Although Hawke was the most prolific Australian informer for the United States in the 1970s, there were other prominent people at that time who secretly gave information. Biographer Troy Bramston rejects the view that Hawke&#x27;s prolonged, discreet involvement with known members of the Central Intelligence Agency within the US Embassy amounted to Hawke being a CIA &quot;spy&quot;.

==Member of Parliament==
Hawke&#x27;s first attempt to enter Parliament came during the 1963 federal election. He stood in the seat of Corio in Geelong and managed to achieve a 3.1% swing against the national trend, although he fell short of ousting longtime Liberal incumbent Hubert Opperman. Hawke rejected several opportunities to enter Parliament throughout the 1970s, something he later wrote that he &quot;regretted&quot;. He eventually stood for election to the House of Representatives at the 1980 election for the safe Melbourne seat of Wills, winning it comfortably. Immediately upon his election to Parliament, Hawke was appointed to the Shadow Cabinet by Labor Leader Bill Hayden as Shadow Minister for Industrial Relations.

Hayden, after having led the Labor Party to narrowly lose the 1980 election, was increasingly subject to criticism from Labor MPs over his leadership style. To quell speculation over his position, Hayden called a leadership spill on 16 July 1982, believing that if he won he would be guaranteed to lead Labor through to the next election. Hawke decided to challenge Hayden in the spill, but Hayden defeated him by five votes; the margin of victory, however, was too slim to dispel doubts that he could lead the Labor Party to victory at an election. Despite his defeat, Hawke began to agitate more seriously behind the scenes for a change in leadership, with opinion polls continuing to show that Hawke was a far more popular public figure than both Hayden and Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. Hayden was further weakened after Labor&#x27;s unexpectedly poor performance at a by-election in December 1982 for the Victorian seat of Flinders, following the resignation of the sitting member, former deputy Liberal leader Phillip Lynch. Labor needed a swing of 5.5% to win the seat and had been predicted by the media to win, but could only achieve 3%.

Labor Party power-brokers, such as Graham Richardson and Barrie Unsworth, now openly switched their allegiance from Hayden to Hawke. More significantly, Hayden&#x27;s staunch friend and political ally, Labor&#x27;s Senate Leader John Button, had become convinced that Hawke&#x27;s chances of victory at an election were greater than Hayden&#x27;s. Initially, Hayden believed that he could remain in his job, but Button&#x27;s defection proved to be the final straw in convincing Hayden that he would have to resign as Labor Leader. Less than two months after the Flinders by-election result, Hayden announced his resignation as Leader of the Labor Party on 3 February 1983. Hawke was subsequently elected as Leader unopposed on 8 February, and became Leader of the Opposition in the process. Having learned that morning about the possible leadership change, on the same that Hawke assumed the leadership of the Labor Party, Malcolm Fraser called a snap election for 5 March 1983, unsuccessfully attempting to prevent Labor from making the leadership change. However, he was unable to have the Governor-General confirm the election before Labor announced the change.

At the 1983 election, Hawke led Labor to a landslide victory, achieving a 24-seat swing and ending seven years of Liberal Party rule.

With the election called at the same time that Hawke became Labor leader this meant that Hawke never sat in Parliament as Leader of the Opposition having spent the entirety of his short Opposition leadership in the election campaign which he won.

==Prime Minister of Australia (1983–1991)==
===Leadership style===

After Labor&#x27;s landslide victory, Hawke was sworn in as the Prime Minister by the Governor-General Ninian Stephen on 11 March 1983. The style of the Hawke government was deliberately distinct from the Whitlam government, the Labor government that preceded it. Rather than immediately initiating multiple extensive reform programs as Whitlam had, Hawke announced that Malcolm Fraser&#x27;s pre-election concealment of the budget deficit meant that many of Labor&#x27;s election commitments would have to be deferred. As part of his internal reforms package, Hawke divided the government into two tiers, with only the most senior ministers sitting in the Cabinet of Australia. The Labor caucus was still given the authority to determine who would make up the Ministry, but this move gave Hawke unprecedented powers to empower individual ministers.

After Australia won the America&#x27;s Cup in 1983 Hawke said &quot;any boss who sacks anyone for not turning up today is a bum&quot;, effectively declaring an impromptu national public holiday.

In particular, the political partnership that developed between Hawke and his Treasurer, Paul Keating, proved to be essential to Labor&#x27;s success in government, with multiple Labor figures in years since citing the partnership as the party&#x27;s greatest ever. The two men proved a study in contrasts: Hawke was a Rhodes Scholar; Keating left high school early. Hawke&#x27;s enthusiasms were cigars, betting and most forms of sport; Keating preferred classical architecture, Mahler symphonies and collecting British Regency and French Empire antiques. Despite not knowing one another before Hawke assumed the leadership in 1983, the two formed a personal as well as political relationship which enabled the Government to pursue a significant number of reforms, although there were occasional points of tension between the two.

The Labor Caucus under Hawke also developed a more formalised system of parliamentary factions, which significantly altered the dynamics of caucus operations. Unlike many of his predecessor leaders, Hawke&#x27;s authority within the Labor Party was absolute. This enabled him to persuade MPs to support a substantial set of policy changes which had not been considered achievable by Labor governments in the past. Individual accounts from ministers indicate that while Hawke was not often the driving force behind individual reforms, outside of broader economic changes, he took on the role of providing political guidance on what was electorally feasible and how best to sell it to the public, tasks at which he proved highly successful. Hawke took on a very public role as Prime Minister, campaigning frequently even outside of election periods, and for much of his time in office proved to be incredibly popular with the Australian electorate; to this date he still holds the highest ever AC Nielsen approval rating of 75%.

===Economic policy===

The Hawke government oversaw significant economic reforms, and is often cited by economic historians as being a &quot;turning point&quot; from a protectionist, agricultural model to a more globalised and services-oriented economy. According to the journalist Paul Kelly, &quot;the most influential economic decisions of the 1980s were the floating of the Australian dollar and the deregulation of the financial system&quot;. Although the Fraser government had played a part in the process of financial deregulation by commissioning the 1981 Campbell Report, opposition from Fraser himself had stalled this process. Shortly after its election in 1983, the Hawke government took the opportunity to implement a comprehensive program of economic reform, in the process &quot;transform(ing) economics and politics in Australia&quot;.

Hawke and Keating together led the process for overseeing the economic changes by launching a &quot;National Economic Summit&quot; one month after their election in 1983, which brought together business and industrial leaders together with politicians and trade union leaders; the three-day summit led to a unanimous adoption of a national economic strategy, generating sufficient political capital for widespread reform to follow. Among other reforms, the Hawke government floated the Australian dollar, repealed rules that prohibited foreign-owned banks to operate in Australia, dismantled the protectionist tariff system, privatised several state sector industries, ended the subsidisation of loss-making industries, and sold off part of the state-owned Commonwealth Bank.

The taxation system was also significantly reformed, with income tax rates reduced and the introduction of a fringe benefits tax and a capital gains tax; the latter two reforms were strongly opposed by the Liberal Party at the time, but were never reversed by them when they eventually returned to office in 1996. Partially offsetting these imposts upon the business community—the &quot;main loser&quot; from the 1985 Tax Summit according to Paul Kelly—was the introduction of full dividend imputation, a reform insisted upon by Keating. Funding for schools was also considerably increased as part of this package, while financial assistance was provided for students to enable them to stay at school longer; the number of Australian children completing school rose from 3 in 10 at the beginning of the Hawke government to 7 in 10 by its conclusion in 1991. Considerable progress was also made in directing assistance &quot;to the most disadvantaged recipients over the whole range of welfare benefits.&quot;

===Social and environmental policy===
Although criticisms were leveled against the Hawke government that it did not achieve all it said it would do on social policy, it nevertheless enacted a series of reforms which remain in place to the present day. From 1983 to 1989, the Government oversaw the permanent establishment of universal health care in Australia with the creation of Medicare, doubled the number of subsidised childcare places, began the introduction of occupational superannuation, oversaw a significant increase in school retention rates, created subsidised homecare services, oversaw the elimination of poverty traps in the welfare system, increased the real value of the old-age pension, reintroduced the six-monthly indexation of single-person unemployment benefits, and established a wide-ranging programme for paid family support, known as the Family Income Supplement. During the 1980s, the proportion of total government outlays allocated to families, the sick, single parents, widows, the handicapped, and veterans was significantly higher than under the previous Fraser and Whitlam governments.

In 1984, the Hawke government enacted the landmark Sex Discrimination Act 1984, which eliminated discrimination on the grounds of sex within the workplace. In 1989, Hawke oversaw the gradual re-introduction of some tuition fees for university study, setting up the Higher Education Contributions Scheme (HECS). Under the original HECS, a $1,800 fee was charged to all university students, and the Commonwealth paid the balance. A student could defer payment of this HECS amount and repay the debt through the tax system, when the student&#x27;s income exceeds a threshold level. As part of the reforms, Colleges of Advanced Education entered the university sector by various means. by doing so, university places were able to be expanded. Further notable policy decisions taken during the Government&#x27;s time in office included the public health campaign regarding HIV/AIDS, and Indigenous land rights reform, with an investigation of the idea of a treaty between Aborigines and the Government being launched, although the latter would be overtaken by events, notably the Mabo court decision.

The Hawke government also drew attention for a series of notable environmental decisions, particularly in its second and third terms. In 1983, Hawke personally vetoed the construction of the Franklin Dam in Tasmania, responding to a groundswell of protest around the issue. Hawke also secured the nomination of the Wet Tropics of Queensland as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987, preventing the forests there from being logged. Hawke would later appoint Graham Richardson as Environment Minister, tasking him with winning the second-preference support from environmental parties, something which Richardson later claimed was the major factor in the government&#x27;s narrow re-election at the 1990 election. In the Government&#x27;s fourth term, Hawke personally led the Australian delegation to secure changes to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, ultimately winning a guarantee that drilling for minerals within Antarctica would be totally prohibited until 2048 at the earliest. Hawke later claimed that the Antarctic drilling ban was his &quot;proudest achievement&quot;.

===Industrial relations policy===

As a former ACTU President, Hawke was well-placed to engage in reform of the industrial relations system in Australia, taking a lead on this policy area as in few others. Working closely with ministerial colleagues and the ACTU Secretary, Bill Kelty, Hawke negotiated with trade unions to establish the Prices and Incomes Accord in 1983, an agreement whereby unions agreed to restrict their demands for wage increases, and in turn the Government guaranteed to both minimise inflation and promote an increased social wage, including by establishing new social programmes such as Medicare.

Inflation had been a significant issue for the previous decade prior to the election of the Hawke government, regularly running into double-digits. The process of the Accord, by which the Government and trade unions would arbitrate and agree upon wage increases in many sectors, led to a decrease in both inflation and unemployment through to 1990. Criticisms of the Accord would come from both the right and the left of politics. Left-wing critics claimed that it kept real wages stagnant, and that the Accord was a policy of class collaboration and corporatism. By contrast, right-wing critics claimed that the Accord reduced the flexibility of the wages system. Supporters of the Accord, however, pointed to the improvements in the social security system that occurred, including the introduction of rental assistance for social security recipients, the creation of labour market schemes such as NewStart, and the introduction of the Family Income Supplement. In 1986, the Hawke government passed a bill to de-register the Builders Labourers Federation federally due to the union not following the Accord agreements.

Despite a percentage fall in real money wages from 1983 to 1991, the social wage of Australian workers was argued by the Government to have improved drastically as a result of these reforms, and the ensuing decline in inflation. The Accord was revisited six further times during the Hawke government, each time in response to new economic developments. The seventh and final revisiting would ultimately lead to the establishment of the enterprise bargaining system, although this would be finalised shortly after Hawke left office in 1991.

===Foreign policy===
Arguably the most significant foreign policy achievement of the Government took place in 1989, after Hawke proposed a south-east Asian region-wide forum for leaders and economic ministers to discuss issues of common concern. After winning the support of key countries in the region, this led to the creation of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). The first APEC meeting duly took place in Canberra in November 1989; the economic ministers of Australia, Brunei, Canada, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and the United States all attended. APEC would subsequently grow to become one of the most pre-eminent high-level international forums in the world, particularly after the later inclusions of China and Russia, and the Keating government&#x27;s later establishment of the APEC Leaders&#x27; Forum.

Elsewhere in Asia, the Hawke government played a significant role in the build-up to the United Nations peace process for Cambodia, culminating in the Transitional Authority; Hawke&#x27;s Foreign Minister Gareth Evans was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in negotiations. Hawke also took a major public stand after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre; despite having spent years trying to get closer relations with China, Hawke gave a tearful address on national television describing the massacre in graphic detail, and unilaterally offered asylum to over 42,000 Chinese students who were living in Australia at the time, many of whom had publicly supported the Tiananmen protesters. Hawke did so without even consulting his Cabinet, stating later that he felt he simply had to act.

The Hawke government pursued a close relationship with the United States, assisted by Hawke&#x27;s close friendship with US Secretary of State George Shultz; this led to a degree of controversy when the Government supported the US&#x27;s plans to test ballistic missiles off the coast of Tasmania in 1985, as well as seeking to overturn Australia&#x27;s long-standing ban on uranium exports. Although the US ultimately withdrew the plans to test the missiles, the furore led to a fall in Hawke&#x27;s approval ratings. Shortly after the 1990 election, Hawke would lead Australia into its first overseas military campaign since the Vietnam War, forming a close alliance with US President George H. W. Bush to join the coalition in the Gulf War. The Royal Australian Navy contributed several destroyers and frigates to the war effort, which successfully concluded in February 1991, with the expulsion of Iraqi forces from Kuwait. The success of the campaign, and the lack of any Australian casualties, led to a brief increase in the popularity of the Government.

Through his role on the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, Hawke played a leading role in ensuring the Commonwealth initiated an international boycott on foreign investment into South Africa, building on work undertaken by his predecessor Malcolm Fraser, and in the process clashing publicly with Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Margaret Thatcher, who initially favoured a more cautious approach. The resulting boycott, led by the Commonwealth, was widely credited with helping bring about the collapse of apartheid, and resulted in a high-profile visit by Nelson Mandela in October 1990, months after the latter&#x27;s release from a 27-year stint in prison. During the visit, Mandela publicly thanked the Hawke government for the role it played in the boycott.

===Election wins and leadership challenges===
Hawke benefited greatly from the disarray into which the Liberal Party fell after the resignation of Fraser following the 1983 election. The Liberals were torn between supporters of the more conservative John Howard and the more liberal Andrew Peacock, with the pair frequently contesting the leadership. Hawke and Keating were also able to use the concealment of the size of the budget deficit by Fraser before the 1983 election to great effect, damaging the Liberal Party&#x27;s economic credibility as a result.

However, Hawke&#x27;s time as Prime Minister also saw friction develop between himself and the grassroots of the Labor Party, many of whom were unhappy at what they viewed as Hawke&#x27;s iconoclasm and willingness to cooperate with business interests. Hawke regularly and publicly expressed his willingness to cull Labor&#x27;s &quot;sacred cows&quot;. The Labor Left faction, as well as prominent Labor backbencher Barry Jones, offered repeated criticisms of a number of government decisions. Hawke was also subject to challenges from some former colleagues in the trade union movement over his &quot;confrontationalist style&quot; in siding with the airline companies in the 1989 Australian pilots&#x27; strike.

Nevertheless, Hawke was able to comfortably maintain a lead as preferred prime minister in the vast majority of opinion polls carried out throughout his time in office. He recorded the highest popularity rating ever measured by an Australian opinion poll, reaching 75% approval in 1984. After leading Labor to a comfortable victory in the snap 1984 election, called to bring the mandate of the House of Representatives back in line with the Senate, Hawke was able to secure an unprecedented third consecutive term for Labor with a landslide victory in the double dissolution election of 1987. Hawke was subsequently able to lead the nation in the bicentennial celebrations of 1988, culminating with him welcoming Queen Elizabeth II to open the newly constructed Parliament House.

The late-1980s recession, and the accompanying high interest rates, saw the Government fall in opinion polls, with many doubting that Hawke could win a fourth election. Keating, who had long understood that he would eventually succeed Hawke as prime minister, began to plan a leadership change; at the end of 1988, Keating put pressure on Hawke to retire in the new year. Hawke rejected this suggestion but reached a secret agreement with Keating, the so-called &quot;Kirribilli Agreement&quot;, stating that he would step down in Keating&#x27;s favour at some point after the 1990 election. Hawke subsequently won that election, in the process leading Labor to a record fourth consecutive electoral victory, albeit by a slim margin. Hawke appointed Keating as deputy prime minister to replace the retiring Lionel Bowen.

By the end of 1990, frustrated by the lack of any indication from Hawke as to when he might retire, Keating made a provocative speech to the Federal Parliamentary Press Gallery. Hawke considered the speech disloyal, and told Keating he would renege on the Kirribilli Agreement as a result. After attempting to force a resolution privately, Keating finally resigned from the Government in June 1991 to challenge Hawke for the leadership. His resignation came soon after Hawke vetoed in Cabinet a proposal backed by Keating and other ministers for mining to take place at Coronation Hill in Kakadu National Park. Hawke won the leadership spill, and in a press conference after the result, Keating declared that he had fired his &quot;one shot&quot; on the leadership. Hawke appointed John Kerin to replace Keating as Treasurer.

Despite his victory in the June spill, Hawke quickly began to be regarded by many of his colleagues as a &quot;wounded&quot; leader; he had now lost his long-term political partner, his ratings in opinion polls were beginning to fall significantly, and after nearly nine years as Prime Minister, there was speculation that it would soon be time for a new leader. Hawke&#x27;s leadership was ultimately irrevocably damaged at the end of 1991; after Liberal Leader John Hewson released &#x27;Fightback!&#x27;, a detailed proposal for sweeping economic change, including the introduction of a goods and services tax, Hawke was forced to sack Kerin as Treasurer after the latter made a public gaffe attempting to attack the policy. Keating duly challenged for the leadership a second time on 19 December, arguing that he would better placed to defeat Hewson; this time, Keating succeeded, narrowly defeating Hawke by 56 votes to 51.

In a speech to the House of Representatives following the vote, Hawke declared that his nine years as prime minister had left Australia a better and wealthier country, and he was given a standing ovation by those present. He subsequently tendered his resignation to the Governor-General and pledged support to his successor. Hawke briefly returned to the backbench, before resigning from Parliament on 20 February 1992, sparking a by-election which was won by the independent candidate Phil Cleary from among a record field of 22 candidates. Keating would go on to lead Labor to a fifth victory at the 1993 election, although he was defeated by the Liberal Party at the 1996 election.

Hawke wrote that he had very few regrets over his time in office, although stated he wished he had been able to advance the cause of Indigenous land rights further. His bitterness towards Keating over the leadership challenges surfaced in his earlier memoirs, although by the 2000s Hawke stated he and Keating had buried their differences, and that they regularly dined together and considered each other friends. The publication of the book &quot;Hawke: The Prime Minister&quot;, by Hawke&#x27;s second wife, Blanche d&#x27;Alpuget, in 2010, reignited conflict between the two, with Keating accusing Hawke and d&#x27;Alpuget of spreading falsehoods about his role in the Hawke government. Despite this, the two campaigned together for Labor several times, including at the 2019 election, where they released their first joint article for nearly three decades; Craig Emerson, who worked for both men, said they had reconciled in later years after Hawke grew ill.

==Retirement and later life==

After leaving Parliament, Hawke entered the business world, taking on a number of directorships and consultancy positions which enabled him to achieve considerable financial success. He avoided public involvement with the Labor Party during Keating&#x27;s tenure as prime minister, not wanting to be seen as attempting to overshadow his successor. After Keating&#x27;s defeat and the election of the Howard government at the 1996 election, he returned to public campaigning with Labor and regularly appearing at election launches. Despite his personal affection for Queen Elizabeth II, boasting that he had been her &quot;favourite Prime Minister&quot;, Hawke was an enthusiastic republican and joined the campaign for a Yes vote in the 1999 republic referendum.

In 2002, Hawke was named to South Australia&#x27;s Economic Development Board during the Rann government. In the lead up to the 2007 election, Hawke made a considerable personal effort to support Kevin Rudd, making speeches at a large number of campaign office openings across Australia, and appearing in multiple campaign advertisements. As well as campaigning against WorkChoices, Hawke also attacked John Howard&#x27;s record as Treasurer, stating &quot;it was the judgement of every economist and international financial institution that it was the restructuring reforms undertaken by my government, with the full cooperation of the trade union movement, which created the strength of the Australian economy today&quot;. In February 2008, after Rudd&#x27;s victory, Hawke joined former Prime Ministers Gough Whitlam, Malcolm Fraser and Paul Keating in Parliament House to witness the long anticipated apology to the Stolen Generations.

In 2009, Hawke helped establish the Centre for Muslim and Non-Muslim Understanding at the University of South Australia. Interfaith dialogue was an important issue for Hawke, who told &quot;The Adelaide Review&quot; that he was &quot;convinced that one of the great potential dangers confronting the world is the lack of understanding in regard to the Muslim world. Fanatics have misrepresented what Islam is. They give a false impression of the essential nature of Islam.&quot;

In 2016, after taking part in Andrew Denton&#x27;s Better Off Dead podcast, Hawke added his voice to calls for voluntary euthanasia to be legalised. Hawke labelled as &#x27;absurd&#x27; the lack of political will to fix the problem. He revealed that he had such an arrangement with his wife Blanche should such a devastating medical situation occur. He also publicly advocated for nuclear power and the importation of international spent nuclear fuel to Australia for storage and disposal, stating that this could lead to considerable economic benefits for Australia.

In late December 2018, Hawke revealed that he was in &quot;terrible health&quot;. While predicting a Labor win in the upcoming 2019 federal election, Hawke said he &quot;may not witness the party&#x27;s success&quot;. In May 2019, the month of the election, he issued a joint statement with Paul Keating endorsing Labor&#x27;s economic plan and condemning the Liberal Party for &quot;completely [giving] up the economic reform agenda&quot;. They stated that &quot;Shorten&#x27;s Labor is the only party of government focused on the need to modernise the economy to deal with the major challenge of our time: human induced climate change&quot;. It was the first joint press statement released by the two since 1991.

In March 2022, Troy Bramston, a journalist for &quot;The Australian&quot; and a political historian, wrote an unauthorised biography of Hawke titled &quot;Bob Hawke: Demons and Destiny&quot;. Hawke gave Bramston full access to his previously unavailable personal papers and granted a series of interviews for the book. Bramston was the last person to interview Hawke before his death. The book, drawing on extensive Australian and international archives, and interviews with more than 100 people, is regarded as &quot;definitive&quot; and was shortlisted for the Australian Political Book of the Year Award.

On 16 May 2019, two days before the election, Hawke died at his home in Northbridge at the age of 89, following a short illness. His family held a private cremation on 27 May at Macquarie Park Cemetery and Crematorium where he was subsequently interred. A state memorial was held at the Sydney Opera House on 14 June; speakers included Craig Emerson as master of ceremonies and Kim Beazley reading the eulogy, as well as Paul Keating, Julia Gillard, Bill Kelty, Ross Garnaut, and incumbent Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese.

==Personal life==

Hawke married Hazel Masterson in 1956 at Perth Trinity Church. They had three children: Susan (born 1957), Stephen (born 1959) and Roslyn (born 1961). Their fourth child, Robert Jr, died in early infancy in 1963. Hawke was named Victorian Father of the Year in 1971, an honour which his wife disputed due to his heavy drinking and womanising. The couple divorced in 1994, after he left her for the writer Blanche d&#x27;Alpuget, and the two lived together in Northbridge, a suburb on the North Shore of Sydney. The divorce estranged Hawke from some of his family for a period, although they had reconciled by the 2010s.

Throughout his early life, Hawke was a heavy drinker, having set a world record for drinking during his years as a student. Hawke eventually suffered from alcohol poisoning following the death of his and Hazel&#x27;s infant son in 1963. He publicly announced in 1980 that he would abstain from alcohol to seek election to Parliament, in a move which garnered significant public attention and support. Hawke began to drink again following his retirement from politics, although to a more manageable extent; on several occasions, in his later years, videos of Hawke downing beer at cricket matches would frequently go viral.

On the subject of religion, Hawke wrote, while attending the 1952 World Christian Youth Conference in India, that &quot;there were all these poverty stricken kids at the gate of this palatial place where we were feeding our face and I just (was) struck by this enormous sense of irrelevance of religion to the needs of people&quot;. He subsequently abandoned his Christian beliefs. By the time he entered politics he was a self-described agnostic. Hawke told Andrew Denton in 2008 that his father&#x27;s Christian faith had continued to influence his outlook, saying &quot;My father said if you believe in the fatherhood of God you must necessarily believe in the brotherhood of man, it follows necessarily, and even though I left the church and was not religious, that truth remained with me.&quot;

Hawke was a supporter of National Rugby League club the Canberra Raiders.

== Legacy ==

A biographical television film, &quot;Hawke&quot;, premiered on the Ten Network in Australia on 18 July 2010, with Richard Roxburgh playing the title character. Rachael Blake and Felix Williamson portrayed Hazel Hawke and Paul Keating, respectively. Roxburgh reprised his role as Hawke in the 2020 episode &quot;Terra Nullius&quot; of the Netflix series &quot;The Crown&quot;.

The Bob Hawke Gallery in Bordertown, which contains memorabilia from his life, was opened by Hawke in 2002. Hawke House, the house in Bordertown where Hawke spent his early childhood, was purchased by the Australian Government in 2021 and opened as an accommodation and function space in May 2024. A bronze bust of Hawke is located at the town&#x27;s civic centre.

In December 2020, the Western Australian Government announced that it had purchased Hawke&#x27;s childhood home in West Leederville and would maintain it as a state asset. The property will also be assessed for entry onto the State Register of Heritage Places.

The Australian Government pledged $5 million in July 2019 to establish a new annual scholarship—the Bob Hawke John Monash Scholarship—through the General Sir John Monash Foundation. Bob Hawke College, a high school in Subiaco, Western Australia named after Hawke, was opened in February 2020.

In March 2020, the Australian Electoral Commission announced that it would create a new Australian electoral division in the House of Representatives named in honour of Hawke. The Division of Hawke was first contested at the 2022 federal election, and is located in the state of Victoria, near the seat of Wills, which Hawke represented from 1980 to 1992.

<text>Baldr (Old Norse also Balder, Baldur) is a god in Germanic mythology. In Norse mythology, he is a son of the god Odin and the goddess Frigg, and has numerous brothers, such as Thor and Váli. In wider Germanic mythology, the god was known in Old English as &#x27;, and in Old High German as &#x27;, all ultimately stemming from the Proto-Germanic theonym (&#x27;hero&#x27; or &#x27;prince&#x27;).

During the 12th century, Danish accounts by Saxo Grammaticus and other Danish Latin chroniclers recorded a euhemerized account of his story. Compiled in Iceland during the 13th century, but based on older Old Norse poetry, the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; and the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; contain numerous references to the death of Baldr as both a great tragedy to the Æsir and a harbinger of Ragnarök.

According to &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, a book of Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s Prose Edda, Baldr&#x27;s wife is Nanna and their son is Forseti. Baldr had the greatest ship ever built, &quot;Hringhorni&quot;, and there is no place more beautiful than his hall, Breidablik.

==Name==
The Old Norse theonym &quot;Baldr&quot; (&#x27;brave, defiant&#x27;; also &#x27;lord, prince&#x27;) and its various Germanic cognates – including Old English &quot;Bældæg&quot; and Old High German &quot;Balder&quot; (or &quot;Palter&quot;) – probably stems from Proto-Germanic &quot;*Balðraz&quot; (&#x27;Hero, Prince&#x27;; cf. Old Norse &quot;mann-baldr&quot; &#x27;great man&#x27;, Old English &quot;bealdor&quot; &#x27;prince, hero&#x27;), itself a derivative of &quot;*balþaz&quot;, meaning &#x27;brave&#x27; (cf. Old Norse &quot;ballr&quot; &#x27;hard, stubborn&#x27;, Gothic &quot;balþa*&quot; &#x27;bold, frank&#x27;, Old English &quot;beald&quot; &#x27;bold, brave, confident&#x27;, Old Saxon &quot;bald&quot; &#x27;valiant, bold&#x27;, Old High German &quot;bald&quot; &#x27;brave, courageous&#x27;).

This etymology was originally proposed by Jacob Grimm (1835), who also speculated on a comparison with the Lithuanian &quot;báltas&quot; (&#x27;white&#x27;, also the name of a light-god) based on the semantic development from &#x27;white&#x27; to &#x27;shining&#x27; then &#x27;strong&#x27;. According to linguist Vladimir Orel, this could be linguistically tenable. Philologist Rudolf Simek also argues that the Old English &quot;Bældæg&quot; should be interpreted as meaning &#x27;shining day&#x27;, from a Proto-Germanic root *&quot;bēl&quot;- (cf. Old English &quot;bæl&quot;, Old Norse &quot;bál&quot; &#x27;fire&#x27;) attached to &quot;dæg&quot; (&#x27;day&#x27;).

Old Norse also shows the usage of the word as an honorific in a few cases, as in &quot;baldur î brynju&quot; (Sæm. 272b) and &quot;herbaldr&quot; (Sæm. 218b), in general epithets of heroes. In continental Saxon and Anglo-Saxon tradition, the son of Woden is called not &quot;Bealdor&quot; but &quot;Baldag&quot; (Saxon) and &quot;Bældæg, Beldeg&quot; (Anglo-Saxon), which shows association with &quot;day&quot;, possibly with Day personified as a deity. This, as Grimm points out, would agree with the meaning &quot;shining one, white one, a god&quot; derived from the meaning of Baltic &quot;baltas&quot;, further adducing Slavic &quot;Belobog&quot; and German &quot;Berhta&quot;.

==Attestations==

===Merseburg Incantation===
One of the two Merseburg Incantations names &quot;Balder&quot; (in the genitive singular &quot;Balderes&quot;), but also mentions a figure named &quot;Phol&quot;, considered to be a byname for Baldr (as in Scandinavian &quot;Falr&quot;, &quot;Fjalarr&quot;; (in Saxo) &quot;Balderus&quot; : &quot;Fjallerus&quot;). The incantation relates of &quot;Phol ende Wotan&quot; riding to the woods, where the foot of Baldr&#x27;s foal is sprained. Sinthgunt (the sister of the sun), Frigg and Odin sing to the foot in order for it to heal. The identification with Balder is not conclusive. Modern scholarship suggests that the god Freyr might be meant.

===&quot;Poetic Edda&quot;===

Unlike the Prose Edda, in the Poetic Edda the tale of Baldr&#x27;s death is referred to rather than recounted at length. Baldr is mentioned in &quot;Völuspá&quot;, in &quot;Lokasenna&quot;, and is the subject of the Eddic poem &quot;Baldr&#x27;s Dreams&quot;.

Among the visions which the Völva sees and describes in Völuspá is Baldr&#x27;s death. In stanza 32, the Völva says she saw the fate of Baldr &quot;the bleeding god&quot;:

In the next two stanzas, the Völva refers to Baldr&#x27;s killing, describes the birth of Váli for the slaying of Höðr and the weeping of Frigg:
In stanza 62 of Völuspá, looking far into the future, the Völva says that Höðr and Baldr will come back, with the union, according to Bellows, being a symbol of the new age of peace:

Baldr is mentioned in two stanzas of Lokasenna, a poem which describes a flyting between the gods and the god Loki. In the first of the two stanzas, Frigg, Baldr&#x27;s mother, tells Loki that if she had a son like Baldr, Loki would be killed:

In the next stanza, Loki responds to Frigg, and says that he is the reason Baldr &quot;will never ride home again&quot;:

The Eddic poem &quot;Baldr&#x27;s Dreams&quot; opens with the gods holding a council discussing why Baldr had had bad dreams:
Odin then rides to Hel to a Völva&#x27;s grave and awakens her using magic. The Völva asks Odin, who she does not recognize, who he is, and Odin answers that he is Vegtam (&quot;Wanderer&quot;). Odin asks the Völva for whom are the benches covered in rings and the floor covered in gold. The Völva tells him that in their location mead is brewed for Baldr, and that she spoke unwillingly, so she will speak no more:

Odin asks the Völva to not be silent and asks her who will kill Baldr. The Völva replies and says that Höðr will kill Baldr, and again says that she spoke unwillingly, and that she will speak no more:

Odin again asks the Völva to not be silent and asks her who will avenge Baldr&#x27;s death. The Völva replies that Váli will, when he will be one night old. Once again, she says that she will speak no more:

Odin again asks the Völva to not be silent and says that he seeks to know who the women that will then weep be. The Völva realizes that Vegtam is Odin in disguise. Odin says that the Völva is not a Völva, and that she is the mother of three giants. The Völva tells Odin to ride back home proud, because she will speak to no more men until Loki escapes his bounds.

===&quot;Prose Edda&quot;===
In &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, Baldr is described as follows:

Apart from this description, Baldr is known primarily for the story of his death, which is seen as the first in a chain of events that will ultimately lead to the destruction of the gods at Ragnarök.

Baldr had a dream of his own death and his mother, Frigg, had the same dream. Since dreams were usually prophetic, this depressed him, and so Frigg made every object on earth vow never to hurt Baldr. All objects made this vow, save for the mistletoe—a detail which has traditionally been explained with the idea that it was too unimportant and nonthreatening to bother asking it to make the vow, but which Merrill Kaplan has instead argued echoes the fact that young people were not eligible to swear legal oaths, which could make them a threat later in life.
When Loki, the mischief-maker, heard of this, he made a magical spear from this plant (in some later versions, an arrow). He hurried to the place where the gods were indulging in their new pastime of hurling objects at Baldr, which would bounce off without harming him. Loki gave the spear to Baldr&#x27;s brother, the blind god Höðr, who then inadvertently killed his brother with it (other versions suggest that Loki guided the arrow himself). For this act, Odin and the &quot;ásynja&quot; Rindr gave birth to Váli, who grew to adulthood within a day and slew Höðr.

Baldr was ceremonially burnt upon his ship Hringhorni, the largest of all ships. On the pyre he was given the magical ring Draupnir. At first the gods were not able to push the ship out onto sea, and so they sent for Hyrrokin, a giantess, who came riding on a wolf and gave the ship such a push that fire flashed from the rollers and all the earth shook.

As he was carried to the ship, Odin whispered something in his ear. The import of this speech was held to be unknowable, and the question of what was said was thus used as an unanswerable riddle by Odin in other sources, namely against the giant Vafthrudnir in the Eddic poem &quot;Vafthrudnismal&quot; and in the riddles of Gestumblindi in &quot;Hervarar saga&quot;.

Upon seeing the corpse being carried to the ship, Nanna, his wife, died of grief. She was then placed on the funeral fire (perhaps a toned-down instance of Sati, also attested in the Arab traveller Ibn Fadlan&#x27;s account of a funeral among the Rus&#x27;), after which it was set on fire. Baldr&#x27;s horse with all its trappings was also laid on the pyre.

As the pyre was set on fire, Thor blessed it with his hammer Mjǫllnir. As he did a small dwarf named Litr came running before his feet. Thor then kicked him into the pyre.

Upon Frigg&#x27;s entreaties, delivered through the messenger Hermod, Hel promised to release Baldr from the underworld if all objects alive and dead would weep for him. All did, except a giantess, Þökk (often presumed to be the god Loki in disguise), who refused to mourn the slain god. Thus Baldr had to remain in the underworld, not to emerge until after Ragnarök, when he and his brother Höðr would be reconciled and rule the new earth together with Thor&#x27;s sons.

Besides these descriptions of Baldr, the Prose Edda also explicitly links him to the Anglo-Saxon &quot;Beldeg&quot; in its prologue.

===&quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;===

Writing during the end of the 12th century, the Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus tells the story of Baldr (recorded as &quot;Balderus&quot;) in a form that professes to be historical. According to him, Balderus and Høtherus were rival suitors for the hand of Nanna, daughter of Gewar, King of Norway. Balderus was a demigod and common steel could not wound his sacred body. The two rivals encountered each other in a terrific battle. Though Odin and Thor and the other gods fought for Balderus, he was defeated and fled away, and Høtherus married the princess.

Nevertheless, Balderus took heart of grace and again met Høtherus in a stricken field. But he fared even worse than before. Høtherus dealt him a deadly wound with a magic sword, named Mistletoe, which he had received from Mimir, the satyr of the woods; after lingering three days in pain Balderus died of his injury and was buried with royal honours in a barrow.

===Utrecht Inscription===
A Latin votive inscription from Utrecht, from the 3rd or 4th century C.E., has been theorized as containing the dative form &quot;Baldruo&quot;, pointing to a Latin nominative singular *&quot;Baldruus&quot;, which some have identified with the Norse/Germanic god, although both the reading and this interpretation have been questioned.

=== &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; ===
In the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle Baldr is named as the ancestor of the monarchy of Kent, Bernicia, Deira, and Wessex through his supposed son Brond.

===Toponyms===
There are a few old place names in Scandinavia that contain the name &quot;Baldr&quot;. The most certain and notable one is the (former) parish name Balleshol in Hedmark county, Norway: &quot;a Balldrshole&quot; 1356 (where the last element is &quot;hóll&quot; m &quot;mound; small hill&quot;). Others may be (in Norse forms) &quot;Baldrsberg&quot; in Vestfold county, &quot;Baldrsheimr&quot; in Hordaland county &quot;Baldrsnes&quot; in Sør-Trøndelag county—and (very uncertain) the Balsfjorden fjord and Balsfjord Municipality in Troms county.

In Copenhagen, there is also a Baldersgade, or &quot;Balder&#x27;s Street&quot;. A street in downtown Reykjavík is called Baldursgata (Baldur&#x27;s Street).

In Sweden there is a Baldersgatan (Balder&#x27;s Street) in Stockholm. There is also Baldersnäs (Balder&#x27;s isthmus), Baldersvik (Balder&#x27;s bay), Balders udde (Balder&#x27;s headland) and Baldersberg (Balder&#x27;s mountain) at various places.

<text>&lt;noinclude&gt;

Breiðablik (sometimes anglicised as Breithablik or Breidablik) is the home of Baldr in Nordic mythology.

==Meaning==
The word has been variously translated as &#x27;broad sheen&#x27;, &#x27;Broad gleam&#x27;, &#x27;Broad-gleaming&#x27; or &#x27;the far-shining one&#x27;, 

==Attestations==
===Grímismál===
The Eddic poem Grímnismál describes Breiðablik as the fair home of Baldr:
===Gylfaginning===
In Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s Gylfaginning, Breiðablik is described in a list of places in heaven, identified by some scholars as Asgard:
Later in the work, when Snorri describes Baldr, he gives another description, citing &quot;Grímnismál&quot;, though he does not name the poem:

==Interpretation and discussion==
The name of Breiðablik has been noted to link with Baldr&#x27;s attributes of light and beauty.

Similarities have been drawn between the description of Breiðablik in Grímnismál and Heorot in Beowulf, which are both free of &#x27;baleful runes&#x27; ( and respectively). In Beowulf, the lack of refers to the absence of crimes being committed, and therefore both halls have been proposed to be sanctuaries.

==In popular culture==
* Breidablik is a sacred weapon in &quot;Fire Emblem Heroes&quot; that the Summoner uses to summon Heroes coming from different &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; games.
* In the PlayStation game &quot;Xenogears&quot;, Bledavik is the name of the capital city of the desert kingdom of Aveh on the Ignas continent.

<text>Bilskirnir (Old Norse &quot;lightning-crack&quot;) is the hall of the god Thor in Norse mythology. Here he lives with his wife Sif and their children. According to &quot;Grímnismál&quot;, the hall is the greatest of buildings and contains 540 rooms, located in Asgard, as are all the dwellings of the gods, in the kingdom of Þrúðheimr (or Þrúðvangar according to &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; and &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;).

==Modern influence==
*The hall inspired the name of an Asgard starship commanded by Supreme Commander Thor, in the television series Stargate SG-1 named Beliskner.

<text>In Norse mythology, Brísingamen (or Brísinga men) is the torc or necklace of the goddess Freyja, of which little else is known for certain.

==Etymology==
The name is an Old Norse compound &quot;brísinga-men&quot; whose second element is &quot;men&quot; &quot;(ornamental) neck-ring (of precious metal), torc&quot;.

The etymology of the first element is uncertain. It has been derived from Old Norse &quot;brísingr&quot;, a poetic term for &quot;fire&quot; or &quot;amber&quot; mentioned in the anonymous versified word-lists (&quot;þulur&quot;) appended to many manuscripts of the Prose Edda, making Brísingamen &quot;gleaming torc&quot;, &quot;sunny torc&quot;, or the like. However, &quot;Brísingr&quot; can also be an ethnonym, in which case &quot;Brísinga men&quot; is &quot;torc of the Brísings&quot;; the Old English parallel in &quot;Beowulf&quot; supports this derivation, though who the Brísings (Old Norse &quot;Brísingar&quot;) may have been remains unknown.

==Attestations==

===&quot;Beowulf&quot;===
Brísingamen is referred to in the Anglo-Saxon epic &quot;Beowulf&quot; as &quot;Brosinga mene&quot;. The brief mention in &quot;Beowulf&quot; is as follows (trans. by Howell Chickering, 1977):

The &quot;Beowulf&quot; poet is clearly referring to the legends about Theoderic the Great. The &quot;Þiðrekssaga&quot; tells that the warrior Heime (&quot;Háma&quot; in Old English) takes sides against Ermanaric (&quot;Eormanric&quot;), king of the Goths, and has to flee his kingdom after robbing him; later in life, Hama enters a monastery and gives them all his stolen treasure. However, this saga makes no mention of the great necklace.

===&quot;Poetic Edda&quot;===
In the poem &quot;Þrymskviða&quot; of the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, Þrymr, the king of the jǫtnar, steals Thor&#x27;s hammer, Mjölnir. Freyja lends Loki her falcon cloak to search for it; but upon returning, Loki tells Freyja that Þrymr has hidden the hammer and demanded to marry her in return. Freyja is so wrathful that all the Æsir’s halls beneath her are shaken and the necklace Brísingamen breaks off from her neck. Later Thor borrows Brísingamen when he dresses up as Freyja to go to the wedding at Jǫtunheimr.

===&quot;Prose Edda&quot;===
&quot;Húsdrápa&quot;, a skaldic poem partially preserved in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, relates the story of the theft of Brísingamen by Loki. One day when Freyja wakes up and finds Brísingamen missing, she enlists the help of Heimdallr to help her search for it. Eventually they find the thief, who turns out to be Loki who has transformed himself into a seal. Heimdallr turns into a seal as well and fights Loki (trans. Byock 2005):

After a lengthy battle at Singasteinn, Heimdallr wins and returns Brísingamen to Freyja.

Snorri Sturluson quoted this old poem in &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, saying that because of this legend Heimdallr is called &quot;Seeker of Freyja&#x27;s Necklace&quot; (&quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, section 8) and Loki is called &quot;Thief of Brísingamen&quot; (&quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, section 16). A similar story appears in the later &quot;Sörla þáttr&quot;, where Heimdallr does not appear.

===&quot;Sörla þáttr&quot;===
Sörla þáttr is a short story in the later and extended version of the &quot;Saga of Olaf Tryggvason&quot; in the manuscript of the &quot;Flateyjarbók&quot;, which was written and compiled by two Christian priests, Jon Thordson and Magnus Thorhalson, in the late 14th century. In the end of the story, the arrival of Christianity dissolves the old curse that traditionally was to endure until Ragnarök.

The battle of Högni and Heðinn is recorded in several medieval sources, including the skaldic poem &quot;Ragnarsdrápa&quot;, &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; (section 49), and &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;: king Högni&#x27;s daughter, Hildr, is kidnapped by king Heðinn. When Högni comes to fight Heðinn on an island, Hildr comes to offer her father a necklace on behalf of Heðinn for peace; but the two kings still battle, and Hildr resurrects the fallen to make them fight until Ragnarök. None of these earlier sources mentions Freyja or king Olaf Tryggvason, the historical figure who Christianized Norway and Iceland in the 10th Century.

==Archaeological record==

A Völva was buried with considerable splendour in Hagebyhöga in Östergötland, Sweden. In addition to being buried with her wand, she had received great riches which included horses, a wagon and an Arabian bronze pitcher. There was also a silver pendant, which represents a woman with a broad necklace around her neck. This kind of necklace was only worn by the most prominent women during the Iron Age and some have interpreted it as Freyja&#x27;s necklace Brísingamen. The pendant may represent Freyja herself.

==Modern influence==
Alan Garner wrote a children&#x27;s fantasy novel called &quot;The Weirdstone of Brisingamen&quot;, published in 1960, about an enchanted teardrop bracelet.

Diana Paxson&#x27;s novel &quot;Brisingamen&quot; features Freyja and her necklace.

Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab has a perfumed oil scent named Brisingamen.

Freyja&#x27;s necklace Brisingamen features prominently in Betsy Tobin&#x27;s novel &quot;Iceland&quot;, where the necklace is seen to have significant protective powers.

The Brisingamen feature as a major item in Joel Rosenberg&#x27;s Keepers of the Hidden Ways series of books. In it, there are seven jewels that were created for the necklace by the Dwarfs and given to the Norse goddess. She in turn eventually split them up into the seven separate jewels and hid them throughout the realm, as together they hold the power to shape the universe by its holder. The book&#x27;s plot is about discovering one of them and deciding what to do with the power they allow while avoiding Loki and other Norse characters.

In Christopher Paolini&#x27;s &quot;The Inheritance Cycle&quot;, the word &quot;brisingr&quot; means fire. This is probably a distillation of the word &quot;brisinga&quot;.

Ursula Le Guin&#x27;s short story &quot;Semley&#x27;s Necklace&quot;, the first part of her novel &quot;Rocannon&#x27;s World&quot;, is a retelling of the Brisingamen story on an alien planet.

Brisingamen is represented as a card in the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; Trading Card Game, &quot;Nordic Relic Brisingamen&quot;.

Brisingamen was part of MMORPG &quot;Ragnarok Online&quot; lore, which is ranked as &quot;God item&quot;. The game is heavily based from Norse mythology.

In the &quot;Firefly Online&quot; game, one of the planets of the Himinbjörg system (which features planets named after figures from Germanic mythology) is named Brisingamen. It is third from the star, and has moons named Freya, Beowulf, and Alberich.

The Brisingamen is an item that can be found and equipped in the video game, &quot;&quot;.

In the French comics &quot;Freaks&#x27; Squeele&quot;, the character of Valkyrie accesses her costume change ability by touching a decorative torc necklace affixed to her forehead, named Brizingamen.

<doc id="4064" wikidata="Q848092" url="?curid=4064" title="Borsuk–Ulam theorem">
<text>In mathematics, the Borsuk–Ulam theorem states that every continuous function from an &quot;n&quot;-sphere into Euclidean &quot;n&quot;-space maps some pair of antipodal points to the same point. Here, two points on a sphere are called antipodal if they are in exactly opposite directions from the sphere&#x27;s center.

Formally: if formula_1 is continuous then there exists an formula_2 such that: formula_3.

The case formula_4 can be illustrated by saying that there always exist a pair of opposite points on the Earth&#x27;s equator with the same temperature. The same is true for any circle. This assumes the temperature varies continuously in space, which is, however, not always the case.

The case formula_5 is often illustrated by saying that at any moment, there is always a pair of antipodal points on the Earth&#x27;s surface with equal temperatures and equal barometric pressures, assuming that both parameters vary continuously in space. 

The Borsuk–Ulam theorem has several equivalent statements in terms of odd functions. Recall that formula_6 is the &quot;n&quot;-sphere and formula_7 is the &quot;n&quot;-ball:
* If formula_8 is a continuous odd function, then there exists an formula_2 such that: formula_10.
* If formula_11 is a continuous function which is odd on formula_12 (the boundary of formula_7), then there exists an formula_14 such that: formula_10.

==History==

According to , the first historical mention of the statement of the Borsuk–Ulam theorem appears in . The first proof was given by , where the formulation of the problem was attributed to Stanisław Ulam. Since then, many alternative proofs have been found by various authors, as collected by .

==Equivalent statements==
The following statements are equivalent to the Borsuk–Ulam theorem.

=== With odd functions ===
A function formula_16 is called &quot;odd&quot; (aka &quot;antipodal&quot; or &quot;antipode-preserving&quot;) if for every formula_17: formula_18.

The Borsuk–Ulam theorem is equivalent to the following statement: A continuous odd function from an &quot;n&quot;-sphere into Euclidean &quot;n&quot;-space has a zero. PROOF: 
* If the theorem is correct, then it is specifically correct for odd functions, and for an odd function, formula_19 iff formula_10. Hence every odd continuous function has a zero.
* For every continuous function formula_21, the following function is continuous and odd: formula_22. If every odd continuous function has a zero, then formula_16 has a zero, and therefore, formula_24. Hence the theorem is correct.

=== With retractions ===
Define a &quot;retraction&quot; as a function formula_25 The Borsuk–Ulam theorem is equivalent to the following claim: there is no continuous odd retraction.

Proof: If the theorem is correct, then every continuous odd function from formula_6 must include 0 in its range. However, formula_27 so there cannot be a continuous odd function whose range is formula_12.

Conversely, if it is incorrect, then there is a continuous odd function formula_29 with no zeroes. Then we can construct another odd function formula_30 by:

:formula_31

since formula_16 has no zeroes, formula_33 is well-defined and continuous. Thus we have a continuous odd retraction.

== Proofs ==

===1-dimensional case===
The 1-dimensional case can easily be proved using the intermediate value theorem (IVT).

Let formula_16 be the odd real-valued continuous function on a circle defined by formula_22. Pick an arbitrary formula_17. If formula_10 then we are done. Otherwise, without loss of generality, formula_38 But formula_39 Hence, by the IVT, there is a point formula_40 at which formula_41.

===General case===
====Algebraic topological proof====
Assume that formula_30 is an odd continuous function with formula_43 (the case formula_44 is treated above, the case formula_45 can be handled using basic covering theory). By passing to orbits under the antipodal action, we then get an induced continuous function formula_46 between real projective spaces, which induces an isomorphism on fundamental groups. By the Hurewicz theorem, the induced ring homomorphism on cohomology with formula_47 coefficients [where formula_47 denotes the field with two elements], 

:formula_49

sends formula_50 to formula_51. But then we get that formula_52 is sent to formula_53, a contradiction.

One can also show the stronger statement that any odd map formula_54 has odd degree and then deduce the theorem from this result.

====Combinatorial proof====
The Borsuk–Ulam theorem can be proved from Tucker&#x27;s lemma.

Let formula_8 be a continuous odd function. Because &quot;g&quot; is continuous on a compact domain, it is uniformly continuous. Therefore, for every formula_56, there is a formula_57 such that, for every two points of formula_58 which are within formula_59 of each other, their images under &quot;g&quot; are within formula_60 of each other.

Define a triangulation of formula_58 with edges of length at most formula_59. Label each vertex formula_63 of the triangulation with a label formula_64 in the following way:

* The absolute value of the label is the &quot;index&quot; of the coordinate with the highest absolute value of &quot;g&quot;: formula_65.
* The sign of the label is the sign of &quot;g&quot;, so that: formula_66.

Because &quot;g&quot; is odd, the labeling is also odd: formula_67. Hence, by Tucker&#x27;s lemma, there are two adjacent vertices formula_68 with opposite labels. Assume w.l.o.g. that the labels are formula_69. By the definition of &quot;l&quot;, this means that in both formula_70 and formula_71, coordinate #1 is the largest coordinate: in formula_70 this coordinate is positive while in formula_71 it is negative. By the construction of the triangulation, the distance between formula_70 and formula_71 is at most formula_60, so in particular formula_77 (since formula_78 and formula_79 have opposite signs) and so formula_80. But since the largest coordinate of formula_70 is coordinate #1, this means that formula_82 for each formula_83. So formula_84, where formula_85 is some constant depending on formula_86 and the norm formula_87 which you have chosen.

The above is true for every formula_56; since formula_58 is compact there must hence be a point &quot;u&quot; in which formula_90.

== Corollaries==

* No subset of formula_91 is homeomorphic to formula_6
* The ham sandwich theorem: For any compact sets &quot;A&quot;1, ..., &quot;An&quot; in formula_91 we can always find a hyperplane dividing each of them into two subsets of equal measure.

== Equivalent results ==
Above we showed how to prove the Borsuk–Ulam theorem from Tucker&#x27;s lemma. The converse is also true: it is possible to prove Tucker&#x27;s lemma from the Borsuk–Ulam theorem. Therefore, these two theorems are equivalent.
== Generalizations ==
* In the original theorem, the domain of the function &quot;f&quot; is the unit &quot;n&quot;-sphere (the boundary of the unit &quot;n&quot;-ball). In general, it is true also when the domain of &quot;f&quot; is the boundary of any open bounded symmetric subset of formula_91 containing the origin (Here, symmetric means that if &quot;x&quot; is in the subset then -&quot;x&quot; is also in the subset).
* More generally, if formula_95 is a compact &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Riemannian manifold, and formula_96 is continuous, there exists a pair of points &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in formula_95 such that formula_98 and &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are joined by a geodesic of length formula_59, for any prescribed formula_57.
* Consider the function &quot;A&quot; which maps a point to its antipodal point: formula_101 Note that formula_102 The original theorem claims that there is a point &quot;x&quot; in which formula_103 In general, this is true also for every function &quot;A&quot; for which formula_102 However, in general this is not true for other functions &quot;A&quot;.

<text>Bragi (Old Norse) is the skaldic god of poetry in Norse mythology.

==Etymology==
The theonym Bragi probably stems from the masculine noun &quot;bragr&quot;, which can be translated in Old Norse as &#x27;poetry&#x27; (cf. Icelandic &quot;bragur&quot; &#x27;poem, melody, wise&#x27;) or as &#x27;the first, noblest&#x27; (cf. poetic Old Norse &quot;bragnar&quot; &#x27;chiefs, men&#x27;, &quot;bragningr&quot; &#x27;king&#x27;). It is unclear whether the theonym semantically derives from the first meaning or the second.

A connection has been also suggested with the Old Norse &quot;bragarfull&quot;, the cup drunk in solemn occasions with the taking of vows. The word is usually taken to semantically derive from the second meaning of &quot;bragr&quot; (&#x27;first one, noblest&#x27;). A relation with the Old English term &quot;brego&quot; (&#x27;lord, prince&#x27;) remains uncertain.

&quot;Bragi&quot; regularly appears as a personal name in Old Norse and Old Swedish sources, which according to linguist Jan de Vries might indicate the secondary character of the god&#x27;s name.

==Attestations==


Snorri Sturluson writes in the &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; after describing Odin, Thor, and Baldr:
In &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; Snorri writes:
That Bragi is Odin&#x27;s son is clearly mentioned only here and in some versions of a list of the sons of Odin (see Sons of Odin). But &quot;wish-son&quot; in stanza 16 of the &quot;Lokasenna&quot; could mean &quot;Odin&#x27;s son&quot; and is translated by Hollander as &quot;Odin&#x27;s kin&quot;. Bragi&#x27;s mother is possibly Frigg.

In that poem Bragi at first forbids Loki to enter the hall but is overruled by Odin. Loki then gives a greeting to all gods and goddesses who are in the hall save to Bragi. Bragi generously offers his sword, horse, and an arm ring as peace gift but Loki only responds by accusing Bragi of cowardice, of being the most afraid to fight of any of the Æsir and Elves within the hall. Bragi responds that if they were outside the hall, he would have Loki&#x27;s head, but Loki only repeats the accusation. When Bragi&#x27;s wife Iðunn attempts to calm Bragi, Loki accuses her of embracing her brother&#x27;s slayer, a reference to matters that have not survived. It may be that Bragi had slain Iðunn&#x27;s brother.

A passage in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem &quot;Sigrdrífumál&quot; describes runes being graven on the sun, on the ear of one of the sun-horses and on the hoofs of the other, on Sleipnir&#x27;s teeth, on bear&#x27;s paw, on eagle&#x27;s beak, on wolf&#x27;s claw, and on several other things including on Bragi&#x27;s tongue. Then the runes are shaved off and the shavings are mixed with mead and sent abroad so that Æsir have some, Elves have some, Vanir have some, and Men have some, these being speech runes and birth runes, ale runes, and magic runes. The meaning of this is obscure.

The first part of Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; is a dialogue between Ægir and Bragi about the nature of poetry, particularly skaldic poetry. Bragi tells the origin of the mead of poetry from the blood of Kvasir and how Odin obtained this mead. He then goes on to discuss various poetic metaphors known as &quot;kennings&quot;.

Snorri Sturluson clearly distinguishes the god Bragi from the mortal skald Bragi Boddason, whom he often mentions separately. The appearance of Bragi in the &quot;Lokasenna&quot; indicates that if these two Bragis were originally the same, they have become separated for that author also, or that chronology has become very muddled and Bragi Boddason has been relocated to mythological time. Compare the appearance of the Welsh Taliesin in the second branch of the Mabinogi. Legendary chronology sometimes does become muddled. Whether Bragi the god originally arose as a deified version of Bragi Boddason was much debated in the 19th century, especially by the scholars Eugen Mogk and Sophus Bugge. The debate remains undecided.

In the poem &quot;Eiríksmál&quot; Odin, in Valhalla, hears the coming of the dead Norwegian king Eric Bloodaxe and his host, and bids the heroes Sigmund and Sinfjötli rise to greet him. Bragi is then mentioned, questioning how Odin knows that it is Eric and why Odin has let such a king die. In the poem &quot;Hákonarmál&quot;, Hákon the Good is taken to Valhalla by the valkyrie Göndul and Odin sends Hermóðr and Bragi to greet him. In these poems Bragi could be either a god or a dead hero in Valhalla. Attempting to decide is further confused because &quot;Hermóðr&quot; also seems to be sometimes the name of a god and sometimes the name of a hero. That Bragi was also the first to speak to Loki in the &quot;Lokasenna&quot; as Loki attempted to enter the hall might be a parallel. It might have been useful and customary that a man of great eloquence and versed in poetry should greet those entering a hall. He is also depicted in tenth-century court poetry of helping to prepare Valhalla for new arrivals and welcoming the kings who have been slain in battle to the hall of Odin.

==Skalds named Bragi==

===Bragi Boddason===

In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; Snorri Sturluson quotes many stanzas attributed to Bragi Boddason the old (&quot;Bragi Boddason inn gamli&quot;), a Norwegian court poet who served several Swedish kings, Ragnar Lodbrok, Östen Beli and Björn at Hauge who reigned in the first half of the 9th century. This Bragi was reckoned as the first skaldic poet, and was certainly the earliest skaldic poet then remembered by name whose verse survived in memory.

Snorri especially quotes passages from Bragi&#x27;s &quot;Ragnarsdrápa&quot;, a poem supposedly composed in honor of the famous legendary Viking Ragnar Lodbrok (&#x27;Hairy-breeches&#x27;) describing the images on a decorated shield which Ragnar had given to Bragi. The images included Thor&#x27;s fishing for Jörmungandr, Gefjun&#x27;s ploughing of Zealand from the soil of Sweden, the attack of Hamdir and Sorli against King Jörmunrekk, and the never-ending battle between Hedin and Högni.

===Bragi son of Hálfdan the Old===
Bragi son of Hálfdan the Old is mentioned only in the &quot;Skjáldskaparmál&quot;. This Bragi is the sixth of the second of two groups of nine sons fathered by King Hálfdan the Old on Alvig the Wise, daughter of King Eymund of Hólmgard. This second group of sons are all eponymous ancestors of legendary families of the north. Snorri says:

Bragi, from whom the Bragnings are sprung (that is the race of Hálfdan the Generous).

Of the Bragnings as a race and of Hálfdan the Generous nothing else is known. However, &quot;Bragning&quot; is often, like some others of these dynastic names, used in poetry as a general word for &#x27;king&#x27; or &#x27;ruler&#x27;.

===Bragi Högnason===
In the eddic poem &quot;Helgakviða Hundingsbana II&quot;, Bragi Högnason, his brother Dag, and his sister Sigrún were children of Högne, the king of East Götaland. The poem relates how Sigmund&#x27;s son Helgi Hundingsbane agreed to take Sigrún daughter of Högni as his wife against her unwilling betrothal to Hodbrodd son of Granmar the king of Södermanland. In the subsequent battle of Frekastein (probably one of the 300 hill forts of Södermanland, as &quot;stein&quot; meant &quot;hill fort&quot;) against Högni and Granmar, all the chieftains on Granmar&#x27;s side are slain, including Bragi, except for Bragi&#x27;s brother Dag.

==In popular culture==
In the 2002 Ensemble Studios game &quot;Age of Mythology&quot;, Bragi is one of nine minor gods Norse players can worship.

<doc id="4068" wikidata="Q1290" url="?curid=4068" title="Blaise Pascal">
<text>Blaise Pascal (19June 162319August 1662) was a French mathematician, physicist, inventor, philosopher, and Catholic writer.

Pascal was a child prodigy who was educated by his father, a tax collector in Rouen. His earliest mathematical work was on projective geometry; he wrote a significant treatise on the subject of conic sections at the age of 16. He later corresponded with Pierre de Fermat on probability theory, strongly influencing the development of modern economics and social science. In 1642, he started some pioneering work on calculating machines (called Pascal&#x27;s calculators and later Pascalines), establishing him as one of the first two inventors of the mechanical calculator.

Like his contemporary René Descartes, Pascal was also a pioneer in the natural and applied sciences. Pascal wrote in defense of the scientific method and produced several controversial results. He made important contributions to the study of fluids, and clarified the concepts of pressure and vacuum by generalising the work of Evangelista Torricelli. Following Torricelli and Galileo Galilei, in 1647 he rebutted the likes of Aristotle and Descartes who insisted that nature abhors a vacuum.

He is also credited as the inventor of modern public transportation, having established the carrosses à cinq sols, the first modern public transport service, shortly before his death in 1662.

In 1646, he and his sister Jacqueline identified with the religious movement within Catholicism known by its detractors as Jansenism. Following a religious experience in late 1654, he began writing influential works on philosophy and theology. His two most famous works date from this period: the and the &quot;Pensées&quot;, the former set in the conflict between Jansenists and Jesuits. The latter contains Pascal&#x27;s wager, known in the original as the &quot;Discourse on the Machine&quot;, a fideistic probabilistic argument for why one should believe in God. In that year, he also wrote an important treatise on the arithmetical triangle. Between 1658 and 1659, he wrote on the cycloid and its use in calculating the volume of solids. Following several years of illness, Pascal died in Paris at the age of 39.

==Early life and education==
Pascal was born in Clermont-Ferrand, which is in France&#x27;s Auvergne region, by the Massif Central. He lost his mother, Antoinette Begon, at the age of three. His father, Étienne Pascal, also an amateur mathematician, was a local judge and member of the &quot;Noblesse de Robe&quot;. Pascal had two sisters, the younger Jacqueline and the elder Gilberte.

=== Move to Paris ===
In 1631, five years after the death of his wife, Étienne Pascal moved with his children to Paris. The newly arrived family soon hired Louise Delfault, a maid who eventually became a key member of the family. Étienne, who never remarried, decided that he alone would educate his children.

The young Pascal showed an extraordinary intellectual ability, with an amazing aptitude for mathematics and science. Etienne had tried to keep his son from learning mathematics; but by the age of 12, Pascal had rediscovered, on his own, using charcoal on a tile floor, Euclid’s first thirty-two geometric propositions, and was thus given a copy of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;.

==== &quot;Essay on Conics&quot; ====
Particularly of interest to Pascal was a work of Desargues on conic sections. Following Desargues&#x27; thinking, the 16-year-old Pascal produced, as a means of proof, a short treatise on what was called the &quot;Mystic Hexagram&quot;, &quot;Essai pour les coniques&quot; (&quot;Essay on Conics&quot;) and sent it — his first serious work of mathematics — to Père Mersenne in Paris; it is known still today as Pascal&#x27;s theorem. It states that if a hexagon is inscribed in a circle (or conic) then the three intersection points of opposite sides lie on a line (called the Pascal line).

Pascal&#x27;s work was so precocious that René Descartes was convinced that Pascal&#x27;s father had written it. When assured by Mersenne that it was, indeed, the product of the son and not the father, Descartes dismissed it with a sniff: &quot;I do not find it strange that he has offered demonstrations about conics more appropriate than those of the ancients,&quot; adding, &quot;but other matters related to this subject can be proposed that would scarcely occur to a 16-year-old child.&quot;

===Leaving Paris===
In France at that time offices and positions could be—and were—bought and sold. In 1631, Étienne sold his position as second president of the &quot;Cour des Aides&quot; for 65,665 livres. The money was invested in a government bond which provided, if not a lavish, then certainly a comfortable income which allowed the Pascal family to move to, and enjoy, Paris, but in 1638 Cardinal Richelieu, desperate for money to carry on the Thirty Years&#x27; War, defaulted on the government&#x27;s bonds. Suddenly Étienne Pascal&#x27;s worth had dropped from nearly 66,000 livres to less than 7,300.

Like so many others, Étienne was eventually forced to flee Paris because of his opposition to the fiscal policies of Richelieu, leaving his three children in the care of his neighbour Madame Sainctot, a great beauty with an infamous past who kept one of the most glittering and intellectual salons in all France. It was only when Jacqueline performed well in a children&#x27;s play with Richelieu in attendance that Étienne was pardoned. In time, Étienne was back in good graces with the Cardinal and in 1639 had been appointed the king&#x27;s commissioner of taxes in the city of Rouen—a city whose tax records, thanks to uprisings, were in utter chaos.

===Pascaline===

In 1642, in an effort to ease his father&#x27;s endless, exhausting calculations, and recalculations, of taxes owed and paid (into which work the young Pascal had been recruited), Pascal, not yet 19, constructed a mechanical calculator capable of addition and subtraction, called &quot;Pascal&#x27;s calculator&quot; or the &quot;Pascaline&quot;. Of the eight Pascalines known to have survived, four are held by the Musée des Arts et Métiers in Paris and one more by the Zwinger museum in Dresden, Germany, exhibit two of his original mechanical calculators.

Although these machines are pioneering forerunners to a further 400 years of development of mechanical methods of calculation, and in a sense to the later field of computer engineering, the calculator failed to be a great commercial success. Partly because it was still quite cumbersome to use in practice, but probably primarily because it was extraordinarily expensive, the Pascaline became little more than a toy, and a status symbol, for the very rich both in France and elsewhere in Europe. Pascal continued to make improvements to his design through the next decade, and he refers to some 50 machines that were built to his design. He built 20 finished machines over the following 10 years.

==Mathematics==
===Probability===
In 1654, prompted by his friend the Chevalier de Méré, Pascal corresponded with Pierre de Fermat on the subject of gambling problems, and from that collaboration was born the mathematical theory of probability. The specific problem was that of two players who want to finish a game early and, given the current circumstances of the game, want to divide the stakes fairly, based on the chance each has of winning the game from that point. From this discussion, the notion of expected value was introduced. John Ross writes, &quot;Probability theory and the discoveries following it changed the way we regard uncertainty, risk, decision-making, and an individual&#x27;s and society&#x27;s ability to influence the course of future events.&quot; Pascal, in the &quot;Pensées&quot;, used a probabilistic argument, Pascal&#x27;s wager, to justify belief in God and a virtuous life. However, Pascal and Fermat, though doing important early work in probability theory, did not develop the field very far. Christiaan Huygens, learning of the subject from the correspondence of Pascal and Fermat, wrote the first book on the subject. Later figures who continued the development of the theory include Abraham de Moivre and Pierre-Simon Laplace. The work done by Fermat and Pascal into the calculus of probabilities laid important groundwork for Leibniz&#x27;s formulation of the calculus.

===&quot;Treatise on the Arithmetical Triangle&quot;===
Pascal&#x27;s &quot;Traité du triangle arithmétique&quot;, written in 1654 but published posthumously in 1665, described a convenient tabular presentation for binomial coefficients which he called the arithmetical triangle, but is now called Pascal&#x27;s triangle. The triangle can also be represented:

He defined the numbers in the triangle by recursion: Call the number in the (&quot;m&quot; + 1)th row and (&quot;n&quot; + 1)th column &quot;t&quot;&quot;mn&quot;. Then &quot;t&quot;&quot;mn&quot; = &quot;t&quot;&quot;m&quot;–1,&quot;n&quot; + &quot;t&quot;&quot;m&quot;,&quot;n&quot;–1, for &quot;m&quot; = 0, 1, 2, ... and &quot;n&quot; = 0, 1, 2, ... The boundary conditions are &quot;t&quot;&quot;m&quot;,−1 = 0, &quot;t&quot;−1,&quot;n&quot; = 0 for &quot;m&quot; = 1, 2, 3, ... and &quot;n&quot; = 1, 2, 3, ... The generator &quot;t&quot;00 = 1. Pascal concluded with the proof,
:formula_1

In the same treatise, Pascal gave an explicit statement of the principle of mathematical induction. In 1654, he proved &quot;Pascal&#x27;s identity&quot; relating the sums of the &quot;p&quot;-th powers of the first &quot;n&quot; positive integers for &quot;p&quot; = 0, 1, 2, ..., &quot;k&quot;.

That same year, Pascal had a religious experience, and mostly gave up work in mathematics.

===Cycloid===

In 1658, Pascal, while suffering from a toothache, began considering several problems concerning the cycloid. His toothache disappeared, and he took this as a heavenly sign to proceed with his research. Eight days later he had completed his essay and, to publicize the results, proposed a contest.

Pascal proposed three questions relating to the center of gravity, area and volume of the cycloid, with the winner or winners to receive prizes of 20 and 40 Spanish doubloons. Pascal, Gilles de Roberval and Pierre de Carcavi were the judges, and neither of the two submissions (by John Wallis and Antoine de Lalouvère) were judged to be adequate. While the contest was ongoing, Christopher Wren sent Pascal a proposal for a proof of the rectification of the cycloid; Roberval claimed promptly that he had known of the proof for years. Wallis published Wren&#x27;s proof (crediting Wren) in Wallis&#x27;s &quot;Tractus Duo&quot;, giving Wren priority for the first published proof.

==Physics==
Pascal contributed to several fields in physics, most notably the fields of fluid mechanics and pressure. In honour of his scientific contributions, the name &quot;Pascal&quot; has been given to the SI unit of pressure and Pascal&#x27;s law (an important principle of hydrostatics). He introduced a primitive form of roulette and the roulette wheel in his search for a perpetual motion machine.

===Fluid dynamics===
His work in the fields of hydrodynamics and hydrostatics centered on the principles of hydraulic fluids. His inventions include the hydraulic press (using hydraulic pressure to multiply force) and the syringe. He proved that hydrostatic pressure depends not on the weight of the fluid but on the elevation difference. He demonstrated this principle by attaching a thin tube to a barrel full of water and filling the tube with water up to the level of the third floor of a building. This caused the barrel to leak, in what became known as Pascal&#x27;s barrel experiment.

===Vacuum===
By 1647, Pascal had learned of Evangelista Torricelli&#x27;s experimentation with barometers. Having replicated an experiment that involved placing a tube filled with mercury upside down in a bowl of mercury, Pascal questioned what force kept some mercury in the tube and what filled the space above the mercury in the tube. At the time, most scientists including Descartes believed in a plenum, i. e. some invisible matter filled all of space, rather than a vacuum (&quot;Nature abhors a vacuum).&quot; This was based on the Aristotelian notion that everything in motion was a substance, moved by another substance. Furthermore, light passed through the glass tube, suggesting a substance such as aether rather than vacuum filled the space.

Following more experimentation in this vein, in 1647 Pascal produced &quot;Experiences nouvelles touchant le vide&quot; (&quot;New experiments with the vacuum&quot;), which detailed basic rules describing to what degree various liquids could be supported by air pressure. It also provided reasons why it was indeed a vacuum above the column of liquid in a barometer tube. This work was followed by &quot;Récit de la grande expérience de l&#x27;équilibre des liqueurs&quot; (&quot;Account of the great experiment on equilibrium in liquids&quot;) published in 1648.

=== First atmospheric pressure vs. altitude experiment ===
The Torricellian vacuum found that air pressure is equal to the weight of 30 inches of mercury. If air has a finite weight, Earth&#x27;s atmosphere must have a maximum height. Pascal reasoned that if true, air pressure on a high mountain must be less than at a lower altitude. He lived near the Puy de Dôme mountain, tall, but his health was poor so could not climb it. On 19 September 1648, after many months of Pascal&#x27;s friendly but insistent prodding, Florin Périer, husband of Pascal&#x27;s elder sister Gilberte, was finally able to carry out the fact-finding mission vital to Pascal&#x27;s theory. The account, written by Périer, reads:

Pascal replicated the experiment in Paris by carrying a barometer up to the top of the bell tower at the church of Saint-Jacques-de-la-Boucherie, a height of about 50 metres. The mercury dropped two lines. He found with both experiments that an ascent of 7 fathoms lowers the mercury by half a line. Note: Pascal used &quot;pouce&quot; and &quot;ligne&quot; for &quot;inch&quot; and &quot;line&quot;, and &quot;toise&quot; for &quot;fathom&quot;.

In a reply to Étienne Noël, who believed in the plenum, Pascal wrote, echoing contemporary notions of science and falsifiability: &quot;In order to show that a hypothesis is evident, it does not suffice that all the phenomena follow from it; instead, if it leads to something contrary to a single one of the phenomena, that suffices to establish its falsity.&quot;

Blaise Pascal Chairs are given to outstanding international scientists to conduct their research in the Ile de France region.

==Adult life: religion, literature, and philosophy==
=== Religious conversion ===

In the winter of 1646, Pascal&#x27;s 58-year-old father broke his hip when he slipped and fell on an icy street of Rouen; given the man&#x27;s age and the state of medicine in the 17th century, a broken hip could be a very serious condition, perhaps even fatal. Rouen was home to two of the finest doctors in France, Deslandes and de la Bouteillerie. The elder Pascal &quot;would not let anyone other than these men attend him...It was a good choice, for the old man survived and was able to walk again...&quot; However treatment and rehabilitation took three months, during which time La Bouteillerie and Deslandes had become regular visitors.

Both men were followers of Jean Guillebert, proponent of a splinter group from Catholic teaching known as Jansenism. This still fairly small sect was making surprising inroads into the French Catholic community at that time. It espoused rigorous Augustinism. Blaise spoke with the doctors frequently, and after their successful treatment of his father, borrowed from them works by Jansenist authors. In this period, Pascal experienced a sort of &quot;first conversion&quot; and began to write on theological subjects in the course of the following year.

Pascal fell away from this initial religious engagement and experienced a few years of what some biographers have called his &quot;worldly period&quot; (1648–54). His father died in 1651 and left his inheritance to Pascal and his sister Jacqueline, for whom Pascal acted as conservator. Jacqueline announced that she would soon become a postulant in the Jansenist convent of Port-Royal. Pascal was deeply affected and very sad, not because of her choice, but because of his chronic poor health; he needed her just as she had needed him.
By the end of October in 1651, a truce had been reached between brother and sister. In return for a healthy annual stipend, Jacqueline signed over her part of the inheritance to her brother. Gilberte had already been given her inheritance in the form of a dowry. In early January, Jacqueline left for Port-Royal. On that day, according to Gilberte concerning her brother, &quot;He retired very sadly to his rooms without seeing Jacqueline, who was waiting in the little parlor...&quot;
In early June 1653, after what must have seemed like endless badgering from Jacqueline,
Pascal formally signed over the whole of his sister&#x27;s inheritance to Port-Royal, which, to him, &quot;had begun to smell like a cult.&quot; With two-thirds of his father&#x27;s estate now gone, the 29-year-old Pascal was now consigned to genteel poverty.

For a while, Pascal pursued the life of a bachelor. During visits to his sister at Port-Royal in 1654, he displayed contempt for affairs of the world but was not drawn to God.

====&quot;Memorial&quot;====
On the 23 of November, 1654, between 10:30 and 12:30 at night, Pascal had an intense religious experience and immediately wrote a brief note to himself which began: &quot;Fire. God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, not of the philosophers and the scholars...&quot; and concluded by quoting Psalm 119:16: &quot;I will not forget thy word. Amen.&quot; He seems to have carefully sewn this document into his coat and always transferred it when he changed clothes; a servant discovered it only by chance after his death. This piece is now known as the &quot;Memorial&quot;. The story of a carriage accident as having led to the experience described in the &quot;Memorial&quot; is disputed by some scholars.
His belief and religious commitment revitalized, Pascal visited the older of two convents at Port-Royal for a two-week retreat in January 1655. For the next four years, he regularly travelled between Port-Royal and Paris. It was at this point immediately after his conversion when he began writing his first major literary work on religion, the &quot;Provincial Letters&quot;.

== Literature ==

In literature, Pascal is regarded as one of the most important authors of the French Classical Period and is read today as one of the greatest masters of French prose. His use of satire and wit influenced later polemicists.

=== The &quot;Provincial Letters&quot; ===

Beginning in 1656–57, Pascal published his memorable attack on casuistry, a popular ethical method used by Catholic thinkers in the early modern period (especially the Jesuits, and in particular Antonio Escobar). Pascal denounced casuistry as the mere use of complex reasoning to justify moral laxity and all sorts of sins. The 18-letter series was published between 1656 and 1657 under the pseudonym Louis de Montalte and incensed Louis XIV. The king ordered that the book be shredded and burnt in 1660. In 1661, in the midst of the formulary controversy, the Jansenist school at Port-Royal was condemned and closed down; those involved with the school had to sign a 1656 papal bull condemning the teachings of Jansen as heretical. The final letter from Pascal, in 1657, had defied Alexander VII himself. Even Pope Alexander, while publicly opposing them, nonetheless was persuaded by Pascal&#x27;s arguments.

Aside from their religious influence, the &quot;Provincial Letters&quot; were popular as a literary work. Pascal&#x27;s use of humor, mockery, and vicious satire in his arguments made the letters ripe for public consumption, and influenced the prose of later French writers like Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

It is in the &quot;Provincial Letters&quot; that Pascal made his oft-quoted apology for writing a long letter, as he had not had time to write a shorter one.
From Letter XVI, as translated by Thomas M&#x27;Crie:
&#x27;Reverend fathers, my letters were not wont either to be so prolix, or to follow so closely on
one another. Want of time must plead my excuse for both of these faults. The present letter is
a very long one, simply because I had no leisure to make it shorter.&#x27;

Charles Perrault wrote of the &quot;Letters&quot;: &quot;Everything is there—purity of language, nobility of thought, solidity in reasoning, finesse in raillery, and throughout an &quot;agrément&quot; not to be found anywhere else.&quot;

=== Philosophy ===
Pascal is arguably best known as a philosopher, considered by some the second greatest French mind behind René Descartes. He was a dualist following Descartes. However, he is also remembered for his opposition to both the rationalism of the likes of Descartes and simultaneous opposition to the main countervailing epistemology, empiricism, preferring fideism.

In terms of God, Descartes and Pascal disagreed. Pascal wrote that &quot;I cannot forgive Descartes. In all his philosophy he would have been quite willing to dispense with God, but he couldn&#x27;t avoid letting him put the world in motion; afterwards he didn&#x27;t need God anymore&quot;. He opposed the rationalism of people like Descartes as applied to the existence of a God, preferring faith as &quot;reason can decide nothing here&quot;. For Pascal the nature of God was such that such proofs cannot reveal God. Humans &quot;are in darkness and estranged from God&quot; because &quot;he has hidden Himself from their knowledge&quot;.

He cared above all about the philosophy of religion. Pascalian theology has grown out of his perspective that humans are, according to Wood, &quot;born into a duplicitous world that shapes us into duplicitous subjects and so we find it easy to reject God continually and deceive ourselves about our own sinfulness&quot;.

===Philosophy of mathematics===
Pascal&#x27;s major contribution to the philosophy of mathematics came with his &quot;De l&#x27;Esprit géométrique&quot; (&quot;Of the Geometrical Spirit&quot;), originally written as a preface to a geometry textbook for one of the famous Petites écoles de Port-Royal (&quot;Little Schools of Port-Royal&quot;). The work was unpublished until over a century after his death. Here, Pascal looked into the issue of discovering truths, arguing that the ideal of such a method would be to found all propositions on already established truths. At the same time, however, he claimed this was impossible because such established truths would require other truths to back them up—first principles, therefore, cannot be reached. Based on this, Pascal argued that the procedure used in geometry was as perfect as possible, with certain principles assumed and other propositions developed from them. Nevertheless, there was no way to know the assumed principles to be true.

Pascal also used &quot;De l&#x27;Esprit géométrique&quot; to develop a theory of definition. He distinguished between definitions which are conventional labels defined by the writer and definitions which are within the language and understood by everyone because they naturally designate their referent. The second type would be characteristic of the philosophy of essentialism. Pascal claimed that only definitions of the first type were important to science and mathematics, arguing that those fields should adopt the philosophy of formalism as formulated by Descartes.

In &quot;De l&#x27;Art de persuader&quot; (&quot;On the Art of Persuasion&quot;), Pascal looked deeper into geometry&#x27;s axiomatic method, specifically the question of how people come to be convinced of the axioms upon which later conclusions are based. Pascal agreed with Montaigne that achieving certainty in these axioms and conclusions through human methods is impossible. He asserted that these principles can be grasped only through intuition, and that this fact underscored the necessity for submission to God in searching out truths.

==Pensées==


Pascal&#x27;s most influential theological work, referred to posthumously as the &quot;Pensées&quot; (&quot;Thoughts&quot;) is widely considered to be a masterpiece, and a landmark in &quot;French prose&quot;. When commenting on one particular section (Thought #72), Sainte-Beuve praised it as the finest pages in the French language. Will Durant hailed the Pensées as &quot;the most eloquent book in French prose&quot;.

The &quot;Pensées&quot; was not completed before his death. It was to have been a sustained and coherent examination and defense of the Christian faith, with the original title &quot;Apologie de la religion Chrétienne&quot; (&quot;Defense of the Christian Religion&quot;). The first version of the numerous scraps of paper found after his death appeared in print as a book in 1669 titled &quot;Pensées de M. Pascal sur la religion, et sur quelques autres sujets&quot; (&quot;Thoughts of M. Pascal on religion, and on some other subjects&quot;) and soon thereafter became a classic.

One of the &quot;Apologie&quot;″s main strategies was to use the contradictory philosophies of Pyrrhonism and Stoicism, personalized by Montaigne on one hand, and Epictetus on the other, in order to bring the unbeliever to such despair and confusion that he would embrace God.

==Last works and death==
T. S. Eliot described him during this phase of his life as &quot;a man of the world among ascetics, and an ascetic among men of the world.&quot; Pascal&#x27;s ascetic lifestyle derived from a belief that it was natural and necessary for a person to suffer. In 1659, Pascal fell seriously ill. During his last years, he frequently tried to reject the ministrations of his doctors, saying, &quot;Don&#x27;t pity me, sickness is the natural state of Christians, because in it we are, as we should always be, in the suffering of evils, in the deprivation of all the goods and pleasures of the senses, free from all the passions that work throughout the course of life, without ambition, without avarice, in the continual expectation of death.&quot; Desiring to imitate Jesus’ poverty of spirit, in his spirit of zeal and charity, Pascal said if God allowed him to recover from his illness, he would be resolved to &quot;have no other employment or occupation for the rest of my life than the service of the poor.&quot;

Louis XIV suppressed the Jansenist movement at Port-Royal in 1661. In response, Pascal wrote one of his final works, &quot;Écrit sur la signature du formulaire&quot; (&quot;Writ on the Signing of the Form&quot;), exhorting the Jansenists not to give in. Later that year, his sister Jacqueline died, which convinced Pascal to cease his polemics on Jansenism.

=== Inventor of public transportation ===
Pascal&#x27;s last major achievement, returning to his mechanical genius, was inaugurating one of the first land-based public transport services, the carrosses à cinq sols, a network of horse-drawn multi-seat carriages that carried passengers on five fixed routes. Pascal also designated the operation principles which were later used to plan public transportation - the carriages had a fixed route, fixed price (five sols, hence the name), and left even if there were no passengers. The lines were not commercially successful, and the last one closed by 1675. Nonetheless, he has been described as the inventor of public transportation.

=== Illness and death ===
In 1662, Pascal&#x27;s illness became more violent, and his emotional condition had severely worsened since his sister&#x27;s death. Aware that his health was fading quickly, he sought a move to the hospital for incurable diseases, but his doctors declared that he was too unstable to be carried. In Paris on 18 August 1662, Pascal went into convulsions and received extreme unction. He died the next morning, his last words being &quot;May God never abandon me,&quot; and was buried in the cemetery of Saint-Étienne-du-Mont.

An autopsy performed after his death revealed grave problems with his stomach and other organs of his abdomen, along with damage to his brain. Despite the autopsy, the cause of his poor health was never precisely determined, though speculation focuses on tuberculosis, stomach cancer, or a combination of the two. The headaches which affected Pascal are generally attributed to his brain lesion.

==Legacy ==
One of the Universities of Clermont-Ferrand, FranceUniversité Blaise Pascalis named after him. Établissement scolaire français Blaise-Pascal in Lubumbashi, Democratic Republic of the Congo is named after Pascal.

The 1969 Eric Rohmer film &quot;My Night at Maud&#x27;s&quot; is based on the work of Pascal. Roberto Rossellini directed a filmed biopic, &quot;Blaise Pascal&quot;, which originally aired on Italian television in 1971. Pascal was a subject of the first edition of the 1984 BBC Two documentary, &quot;Sea of Faith&quot;, presented by Don Cupitt. The chameleon in the animated film &quot;Tangled&quot; is named for Pascal.

A programming language is named for Pascal. In 2014, Nvidia announced its new Pascal microarchitecture, which is named for Pascal. The first graphics cards featuring Pascal were released in 2016.

The 2017 game &quot;&quot; has multiple characters named after famous philosophers; one of these is a sentient pacifistic machine named Pascal, who serves as a major supporting character. Pascal creates a village for machines to live peacefully with the androids they are at war with and acts as a parental figure for other machines trying to adapt to their newly-found individuality.

The otter in the &quot;Animal Crossing&quot; series is named for Pascal.

The minor planet 4500 Pascal is named in his honor.

Pope Paul VI, in encyclical &quot;Populorum progressio,&quot; issued in 1967, quotes Pascal&#x27;s &quot;Pensées&quot;: 

In 2023, Pope Francis released an apostolic letter, &quot;Sublimitas et miseria hominis&quot;, dedicated to Blaise Pascal, in commemoration of the fourth centenary of his birth.

Pascal influenced both French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, who named his &quot;Pascalian Meditations&quot; (1997) after him, and French philosopher Louis Althusser.

<text>The Brittonic languages (also Brythonic or British Celtic; ; ; and ) form one of the two branches of the Insular Celtic languages; the other is Goidelic. It comprises the extant languages Breton, Cornish, and Welsh. The name &quot;Brythonic&quot; was derived by Welsh Celticist John Rhys from the Welsh word , meaning Ancient Britons as opposed to an Anglo-Saxon or Gael.

The Brittonic languages derive from the Common Brittonic language, spoken throughout Great Britain during the Iron Age and Roman period. In the 5th and 6th centuries emigrating Britons also took Brittonic speech to the continent, most significantly in Brittany and Britonia. During the next few centuries, in much of Britain the language was replaced by Old English and Scottish Gaelic, with the remaining Common Brittonic language splitting into regional dialects, eventually evolving into Welsh, Cornish, Breton, Cumbric, and probably Pictish. Welsh and Breton continue to be spoken as native languages, while a revival in Cornish has led to an increase in speakers of that language. Cumbric and Pictish are extinct, having been replaced by Goidelic and Anglic speech. The Isle of Man and Orkney may also have originally spoken a Brittonic language, but this was later supplanted by Goidelic on the Isle of Man and Norse on Orkney. There is also a community of Brittonic language speakers in (the Welsh settlement in Patagonia).

==Name==
The names &quot;Brittonic&quot; and &quot;Brythonic&quot; are scholarly conventions referring to the Celtic languages of Britain and to the ancestral language they originated from, designated Common Brittonic, in contrast to the Goidelic languages originating in Ireland. Both were created in the 19th century to avoid the ambiguity of earlier terms such as &quot;British&quot; and &quot;Cymric&quot;. &quot;Brythonic&quot; was coined in 1879 by the Celticist John Rhys from the Welsh word . &quot;Brittonic&quot;, derived from &quot;Briton&quot; and also earlier spelled &quot;Britonic&quot; and &quot;Britonnic&quot;, emerged later in the 19th century. &quot;Brittonic&quot; became more prominent through the 20th century, and was used in Kenneth H. Jackson&#x27;s highly influential 1953 work on the topic, &quot;Language and History in Early Britain&quot;. Jackson noted by that time that &quot;Brythonic&quot; had become a dated term: &quot;of late there has been an increasing tendency to use Brittonic instead.&quot; Today, &quot;Brittonic&quot; often replaces &quot;Brythonic&quot; in the literature. Rudolf Thurneysen used &quot;Britannic&quot; in his influential &quot;A Grammar of Old Irish&quot;, although this never became popular among subsequent scholars.

Comparable historical terms include the Medieval Latin and and the Welsh . Some writers use &quot;British&quot; for the language and its descendants, although, due to the risk of confusion, others avoid it or use it only in a restricted sense. Jackson, and later John T. Koch, use &quot;British&quot; only for the early phase of the Common Brittonic language.

Before Jackson&#x27;s work, &quot;Brittonic&quot; and &quot;Brythonic&quot; were often used for all the P-Celtic languages, including not just the varieties in Britain but those Continental Celtic languages that similarly experienced the evolution of the Proto-Celtic language element to . However, subsequent writers have tended to follow Jackson&#x27;s scheme, rendering this use obsolete.

The name &quot;Britain&quot; itself comes from , via Old French and Middle English , possibly influenced by Old English , probably also from Latin , ultimately an adaptation of the native word for the island, .

An early written reference to the British Isles may derive from the works of the Greek explorer Pytheas of Massalia; later Greek writers such as Diodorus of Sicily and Strabo who quote Pytheas&#x27; use of variants such as (), &quot;The Britannic [land, island]&quot;, and (), &quot;Britannic islands&quot;, with being a Celtic word that might mean &#x27;painted ones&#x27; or &#x27;tattooed folk&#x27;, referring to body decoration.

==Evidence==
Knowledge of the Brittonic languages comes from a variety of sources. The early language&#x27;s information is obtained from coins, inscriptions, and comments by classical writers as well as place names and personal names recorded by them. For later languages, there is information from medieval writers and modern native speakers, together with place names. The names recorded in the Roman period are given in Rivet and Smith.

==Characteristics==
The Brittonic branch is also referred to as &quot;P-Celtic&quot; because linguistic reconstruction of the Brittonic reflex of the Proto-Indo-European phoneme is &quot;p&quot; as opposed to Goidelic &quot;k&quot;. Such nomenclature usually implies acceptance of the P-Celtic and Q-Celtic hypothesis rather than the Insular Celtic hypothesis because the term includes certain Continental Celtic languages as well.
Other major characteristics include:
* The retention of the Proto-Celtic sequences and , which mostly result from the Proto-Indo-European syllabic nasals.
* Celtic (written &quot;u&quot; in Latin texts and &quot;ou&quot; in Greek) became &quot;gw-&quot; in initial position, &quot;-w-&quot; internally, whereas in Gaelic it is &quot;f-&quot; in initial position and disappears internally:

Nasal assimilation:
* Voiced stops were assimilated to a preceding nasal:

** Breton &#x27;hundred&#x27; vs. Irish ; Breton &#x27;[personification of] Death&#x27;, Irish &#x27;die&#x27;

==Classification==
The family tree of the Brittonic languages is as follows:
*Common Brittonic
**Western Brittonic
***Cumbric
***Welsh
**Southwestern Brittonic
***Cornish
***Breton
Brittonic languages in use today are Welsh, Cornish and Breton. Welsh and Breton have been spoken continuously since they formed. For all practical purposes Cornish died out during the 18th or 19th century, but a revival movement has more recently created small numbers of new speakers. Also notable are the extinct language Cumbric, and possibly the extinct Pictish. One view, advanced in the 1950s and based on apparently unintelligible ogham inscriptions, was that the Picts may have also used a non-Indo-European language. This view, while attracting broad popular appeal, has virtually no following in contemporary linguistic scholarship.

==History and origins==

The modern Brittonic languages are generally considered to all derive from a common ancestral language termed &quot;Brittonic&quot;, &quot;British&quot;, &quot;Common Brittonic&quot;, &quot;Old Brittonic&quot; or &quot;Proto-Brittonic&quot;, which is thought to have developed from Proto-Celtic or early Insular Celtic by the 6th century BC.

A major archaeogenetics study uncovered a migration into southern Britain in the middle to late Bronze Age, during the 500-year period 1,300–800 BC. The newcomers were genetically most similar to ancient individuals from Gaul. During 1,000–875 BC, their genetic markers swiftly spread through southern Britain, but not northern Britain. The authors describe this as a &quot;plausible vector for the spread of early Celtic languages into Britain&quot;. There was much less inward migration during the Iron Age, so it is likely that Celtic reached Britain before then. Barry Cunliffe suggests that a Goidelic branch of Celtic may already have been spoken in Britain, but that this middle Bronze Age migration would have introduced the Brittonic branch.

Brittonic languages were probably spoken before the Roman invasion throughout most of Great Britain, though the Isle of Man later had a Goidelic language, Manx. During the period of the Roman occupation of what is now England and Wales (AD 43 to ), Common Brittonic borrowed a large stock of Latin words, both for concepts unfamiliar in the pre-urban society of Celtic Britain such as urbanization and new tactics of warfare, as well as for rather more mundane words which displaced native terms (most notably, the word for &#x27;fish&#x27; in all the Brittonic languages derives from the Latin rather than the native – which may survive, however, in the Welsh name of the River Usk, ). Approximately 800 of these Latin loan-words have survived in the three modern Brittonic languages. Pictish may have resisted Latin influence to a greater extent than the other Brittonic languages.

It is probable that at the start of the Post-Roman period, Common Brittonic was differentiated into at least two major dialect groups – Southwestern and Western. (Additional dialects have also been posited, but have left little or no evidence, such as an Eastern Brittonic spoken in what is now the East of England.) Between the end of the Roman occupation and the mid-6th century, the two dialects began to diverge into recognizably separate varieties, the Western into Cumbric and Welsh, and the Southwestern into Cornish and its closely related sister language Breton, which was carried to continental Armorica. Jackson showed that a few of the dialect distinctions between West and Southwest Brittonic go back a long way. New divergencies began around AD 500 but other changes that were shared occurred in the 6th century. Other common changes occurred in the 7th century onward and are possibly due to inherent tendencies. Thus the concept of a Common Brittonic language ends by AD 600. Substantial numbers of Britons certainly remained in the expanding area controlled by Anglo-Saxons, but over the fifth and sixth centuries they mostly adopted the Old English language and culture.

=== Decline ===

The Brittonic languages spoken in what are now Scotland, the Isle of Man, and England began to be displaced in the 5th century through the settlement of Irish-speaking Gaels and Germanic peoples. Henry of Huntingdon wrote that Pictish was &quot;no longer spoken&quot;.

The displacement of the languages of Brittonic descent was probably complete in all of Britain except Cornwall, Wales, and the English counties bordering these areas such as Devon, by the 11th century. Western Herefordshire continued to speak Welsh until the late nineteenth century, and isolated pockets of Shropshire speak Welsh today.

=== Sound changes ===
The large array of Brittonic sound changes has been documented by Schrijver (1995), building upon Jackson (1953).

====Changes to long vowels and diphthongs====
Brittonic has undergone an extensive remodeling of Proto-Celtic diphthongs and long vowels. All original Proto-Celtic diphthongs turned into monophthongs, albeit a number of these re-diphthongized at later stages.

====Changes to short vowels====
The distribution of Proto-Celtic short vowels were reshuffled by various processes in Brittonic, such as the two i-affections, a-affection, raisings, and contact with lenited consonants like &quot;*g&quot; &gt; and &quot;*s&quot; &gt; &quot;*h&quot;.

The default outcomes of stressed short vowels in Brittonic are as follows:

=====Raisings of &quot;*e&quot; and &quot;*o&quot;=====
Welsh exhibits raisings of &quot;*e&quot; to &quot;*i&quot; &gt; &#x27; &gt; &#x27; and &quot;*o&quot; &gt; before a nasal followed by a stop.

It is difficult to determine whether the raising from &quot;*o&quot; to &quot;*u&quot; also affected Cornish and Breton, since both of those languages generally merge &quot;*o&quot; with &quot;*u&quot;.

The raising of &quot;*e&quot; to &quot;*i&quot; occurred in all three major Brittonic languages:
*Proto-Celtic &quot;*sentus&quot; &quot;path&quot; &gt; &quot;*hɪnt&quot; &gt; Middle Welsh &quot;hynt&quot;, Middle Cornish &quot;hyns&quot;, and Old Breton &quot;scoiu-hint&quot; &quot;side-passage&quot;.

Other raising environments identified by Schrijver include:
* When the vowel is preceded by &quot;*m&quot; and followed by &quot;*n&quot;.
* When the vowel is in a pretonic syllable, preceded by an alveolar consonant and followed by a nasal.
* When the vowel is followed by an &quot;*r&quot; which in turn is followed by either &quot;*n&quot; or a velar consonant.

This raising preceded a-affection, since a-affection reverses this raising whenever it applied.

All these raisings not only affected native vocabulary, but also affected Latin loanwords.

=====Interactions of vowels followed by &quot;*g&quot;=====
Multiple special interactions of vowels occurred when followed by &quot;*g&quot;. 
* &quot;*e&quot; in such environments can be raised to &quot;*ɪ&quot; or lowered to &quot;*a&quot; depending on the following sound.
* &quot;*ig&quot; &gt; &quot;*ɪɣ&quot; had a special Welsh development in which it would become &quot;e&quot; in any environment where internal i-affection would apply. This development affected not only &quot;*ig&quot; &gt; &quot;*ɪɣ&quot;, but also &quot;*eg&quot; &gt; &quot;*ɪɣ&quot;.
* The &quot;-a-&quot; in Welsh &quot;Cymraeg&quot; &quot;Welsh language&quot; and &quot;Cymraes&quot; &quot;Welshwoman&quot; (both from a base &quot;*kom-mrog-&quot;) has been explained from a special development of &quot;*-og-&quot; to &quot;*-ag-&quot; pre-apocope antepenultimate syllables.

=====Assimilation of &quot;*oRa&quot; to &quot;*aRa&quot;=====
Closely paralleling the common Celtic change of &quot;*eRa&quot; &gt; &quot;*aRa&quot; (Joseph&#x27;s rule) is the change of &quot;*oRa&quot; to &quot;*aRa&quot; in Brittonic, with &quot;R&quot; standing for any lone sonorant. Unlike Joseph&#x27;s rule, &quot;*oRa&quot; to &quot;*aRa&quot; did not occur in Goidelic. Schrijver demonstrates this rule with the following examples:
* Proto-Celtic &quot;*kolanV-&quot; &quot;corpse&quot;: Welsh &quot;celain&quot;, plural &quot;calanedd&quot; vs. Irish &quot;colainn&quot;
* Proto-Celtic &quot;*toranos&quot; &quot;thunder&quot;: &quot;taran&quot; in all three Brittonic languages vs. Irish &quot;torann&quot;

Assuming that Welsh &quot;manach&quot; (borrowed from Latin &quot;monachus&quot; &quot;monk&quot;) also underwent this assimilation, Schrijver concludes that this change must predate the raising of vowels in &quot;*mVn-&quot; sequences, which in turn predates a-affection (an early fifth-century process).

=====/je/ &gt; /ja/=====
In Brittonic, Celtic &quot;*ye&quot; generally became /ja/. Some examples cited by Schrijver include:
* Proto-Celtic &quot;*yegis&quot; &gt; Brittonic &quot;*jaɣ&quot; &gt; Welsh &quot;iâ&quot; &quot;ice&quot; vs. Old Irish &quot;aig&quot;, genitive &quot;ega&quot; (the &quot;a&quot; in the Irish word arose via an unrelated development involving &quot;*g&quot;)
* Proto-Celtic &quot;*yestu&quot; &quot;boiling&quot; &gt; Brittonic &quot;*jas&quot; &gt; Welsh &quot;ias&quot; vs. early Irish &quot;ess&quot; &quot;cataract&quot;
* Proto-Celtic &quot;*gyemos&quot; &quot;winter&quot; &gt; Brittonic &quot;&quot; &gt; Welsh &quot;gaeaf&quot; vs. Irish &quot;gaim, gem&quot; (&quot;-a-&quot; analogical)

=====&quot;*wo&quot;=====
The sequence &quot;*wo&quot; was quite volatile in Brittonic. It originally manifested as &quot;*wo&quot; in unlenited position and &quot;*wa&quot; in lenited position. Word-initially, this allomorphy was gone in medieval times, leveled out in various ways. Whichever of &quot;*o&quot; or &quot;*a&quot; to be generalized in the reflexes of a word in a given Brittonic language is completely unpredictable, and occasionally both &quot;o&quot; and &quot;a&quot; reflexes have been attested within the same language. Southwest Brittonic languages like Breton and Cornish usually generalize the same variant of &quot;*wo&quot; in a given word while Welsh tends to have its own distribution of variants.

The distribution of &quot;*wo/wa&quot; is also complicated by an Old Breton development where &quot;*wo&quot; that had not turned to &quot;*gwa&quot; would split into &quot;go(u)-&quot; (Old Breton &quot;gu-&quot;) in penultimate post-apocope syllables and &quot;go-&quot; in monosyllables.

=====Developments of &quot;*ub&quot;=====
The sequence &quot;*ub&quot; &gt; &quot;*uβ&quot; remained as such when followed by a consonant, for instance in Proto-Celtic &quot;*dubros&quot; &quot;water&quot; &gt; &quot;*duβr&quot; &gt; Welsh &quot;dwfr&quot;, &quot;dŵr&quot; and Breton &quot;dour&quot;.

However, if no consonant exists after a &quot;*ub&quot; sequence, the &quot;*u&quot; merges with whatever Proto-Celtic &quot;*ou&quot; and &quot;*oi&quot; became, the result of which is written in the Brittonic languages. The lenited &quot;*b&quot; &gt; &quot;*β&quot; is lost word-finally after this happens.
* &quot;*dubus&quot; &quot;black&quot; &gt; Welsh &quot;du&quot;, Cornish &quot;du&quot;, Breton &quot;du&quot;
* &quot;*lubV-&quot; &quot;herb&quot; &gt; Old Breton &quot;tutlub&quot;, &quot;tutlob&quot; &gt; Breton &quot;tule&quot;, &quot;tulo&quot;
* Latin &quot;cubitus&quot; &gt; Middle Welsh &quot;kufyt&quot;, modern Welsh &quot;cufydd&quot;

Schrijver dates this development between the 6th to 8th centuries, with subsequent loss of &quot;*β&quot; datable to the 9th century.

=====a-affection=====
In Brittonic, final a-affection was triggered by final-syllable &quot;*ā&quot; or &quot;*a&quot;, which was later apocopated. This process lowered &quot;*i&quot; and &quot;*u&quot; in the preceding syllable to &quot;*e&quot; and &quot;*o&quot;, respectively.

A-affection, by affecting feminine forms of adjectives and not their masculine counterparts, created root vowel alternations by gender such as &quot;*windos&quot;, feminine &quot;*windā&quot; &gt; &quot;*gwɪnn&quot;, feminine &quot;*gwenn&quot; &gt; Welsh &quot;gwyn&quot;, feminine &quot;gwen&quot;.

=====i-affection=====
There were two separate processes of i-affection in Brittonic: final i-affection and internal i-affection. Both processes caused the fronting of vowels.

====Simplified summary of consonantal outcomes====
The regular consonantal sound changes from Proto-Celtic to Welsh, Cornish, and Breton are summarised in the following table. Where the graphemes have a different value from the corresponding IPA symbols, the IPA equivalent is indicated between slashes. V represents a vowel; C represents a consonant.

==Remnants in England, Scotland and Ireland==

===Place names and river names===

The principal legacy left behind in those territories from which the Brittonic languages were displaced is that of toponyms (place names) and hydronyms (names of rivers and other bodies of water). There are many Brittonic place names in lowland Scotland and in the parts of England where it is agreed that substantial Brittonic speakers remained (Brittonic names, apart from those of the former Romano-British towns, are scarce over most of England). Names derived (sometimes indirectly) from Brittonic include London, Penicuik, Perth, Aberdeen, York, Dorchester, Dover, and Colchester. Brittonic elements found in England include and for &#x27;hill&#x27;, while some such as &quot;co[o]mb[e]&quot; (from ) for &#x27;small deep valley&#x27; and &quot;tor&quot; for &#x27;hill, rocky headland&#x27; are examples of Brittonic words that were borrowed into English. Others reflect the presence of Britons such as Dumbarton – from the Scottish Gaelic meaning &#x27;Fort of the Britons&#x27;, and Walton meaning (in Anglo-Saxon) a &#x27;settlement&#x27; where the &#x27;Britons&#x27; still lived.

The number of Celtic river names in England generally increases from east to west, a map showing these being given by Jackson. These include Avon, Chew, Frome, Axe, Brue and Exe, but also river names containing the elements &quot;der-/dar-/dur-&quot; and &quot;-went&quot; e.g. Derwent, Darwen, Deer, Adur, Dour, Darent, and Went. These names exhibit multiple different Celtic roots. One is * &#x27;water&#x27; (Breton , Cumbric , Welsh ), also found in the place-name Dover (attested in the Roman period as ); this is the source of rivers named Dour. Another is &#x27;oak&#x27; or &#x27;true&#x27; (Bret. , Cumb. , W. ), coupled with two agent suffixes, and ; this is the origin of Derwent, Darent, and Darwen (attested in the Roman period as ). The final root to be examined is . In Roman Britain, there were three tribal capitals named (modern Winchester, Caerwent, and Caistor St Edmunds), whose meaning was &#x27;place, town&#x27;.

===Brittonicisms in English===
Some, including J. R. R. Tolkien, have argued that Celtic has acted as a substrate to English for both the lexicon and syntax. It is generally accepted that Brittonic effects on English are lexically few, aside from toponyms, consisting of a small number of domestic and geographical words, which &quot;may&quot; include &quot;bin&quot;, &quot;brock&quot;, &quot;carr&quot;, &quot;comb&quot;, &quot;crag&quot; and &quot;tor&quot;. Another legacy may be the sheep-counting system &quot;yan tan tethera&quot; in the north, in the traditionally Celtic areas of England such as Cumbria. Several words of Cornish origin are still in use in English as mining-related terms, including costean, gunnies, and vug.

Those who argue against the theory of a more significant Brittonic influence than is widely accepted point out that many toponyms have no semantic continuation from the Brittonic language. A notable example is &quot;Avon&quot; which comes from the Celtic term for river or the Welsh term for river, , but was used by the English as a personal name. Likewise the River Ouse, Yorkshire, contains the Celtic word which merely means &#x27;water&#x27; and the name of the river Trent simply comes from the Welsh word for a &#x27;trespasser&#x27; (figuratively suggesting &#x27;overflowing river&#x27;).

Scholars supporting a Brittonic substrate in English argue that the use of periphrastic constructions (using auxiliary verbs such as &quot;do&quot; and &quot;be&quot; in the continuous/progressive) of the English verb, which is more widespread than in the other Germanic languages, is traceable to Brittonic influence. Others, however, find this unlikely since many of these forms are only attested in the later Middle English period; these scholars claim a native English development rather than Celtic influence. Ian G. Roberts postulates Northern Germanic influence, despite such constructions not existing in Norse. Literary Welsh has the simple present = &#x27;I love&#x27; and the present stative (al. continuous/progressive) = &#x27;I am loving&#x27;, where the Brittonic syntax is partly mirrored in English. (However, English &quot;I am loving&quot; comes from older &quot;I am a-loving&quot;, from still older &#x27;I am in the process of loving&#x27;). In the Germanic sister languages of English, there is only one form, for example in German, though in &quot;colloquial&quot; usage in some German dialects, a progressive aspect form has evolved which is formally similar to those found in Celtic languages, and somewhat less similar to the Modern English form, e.g. &#x27;I am working&#x27; is , literally: &#x27;I am on the working&#x27;. The same structure is also found in modern Dutch (), alongside other structures (e.g. , lit. &#x27;I sit to working&#x27;). These parallel developments suggest that the English progressive is not necessarily due to Celtic influence; moreover, the native English development of the structure can be traced over 1000 years and more of English literature.

Some researchers (Filppula, et al., 2001) argue that other elements of English syntax reflect Brittonic influences. For instance, in English tag questions, the form of the tag depends on the verb form in the main statement (&quot;aren&#x27;t I?&quot;, &quot;isn&#x27;t he?&quot;, &quot;won&#x27;t we?&quot;, etc.). The German and the French , by contrast, are fixed forms which can be used with almost any main statement. It has been claimed that the English system has been borrowed from Brittonic, since Welsh tag questions vary in almost exactly the same way.

===Brittonic effect on the Goidelic languages===
Far more notable, but less well known, are Brittonic influences on Scottish Gaelic, though Scottish and Irish Gaelic, with their wider range of preposition-based periphrastic constructions, suggest that such constructions descend from their common Celtic heritage. Scottish Gaelic contains several P-Celtic loanwords, but, as there is a far greater overlap in terms of Celtic vocabulary than with English, it is not always possible to disentangle P- and Q-Celtic words. However, some common words such as = Welsh , Cumbric are particularly evident.

The Brittonic influence on Scots Gaelic is often indicated by considering Irish language usage, which is not likely to have been influenced so much by Brittonic. In particular, the word (anglicised as &quot;strath&quot;) is a native Goidelic word, but its usage appears to have been modified by the Welsh cognate whose meaning is slightly different. The effect on Irish has been the loan from British of many Latin-derived words. This has been associated with the Christianisation of Ireland from Britain.

<text>Bronski Beat were a British synth-pop band formed in 1983 in London, England. The initial lineup, which recorded the majority of their hits, consisted of Scottish musicians Jimmy Somerville (vocals) and Steve Bronski (keyboards, percussion) and English musician Larry Steinbachek (keyboards, percussion). Simon Davolls contributed backing vocals to many songs. Throughout the band&#x27;s career, Bronski was the only member to appear in every lineup. 

Bronski Beat achieved success in the mid-1980s, particularly with the 1984 single &quot;Smalltown Boy&quot;, from their debut album, &quot;The Age of Consent&quot;. &quot;Smalltown Boy&quot; was their only US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 single. All members of the band were openly gay and their songs reflected this, often containing political commentary on gay issues. Somerville left Bronski Beat in 1985 and went on to have success as lead singer of the Communards and as a solo artist. He was replaced by vocalist John Foster, with whom the band continued to have hits in the UK and Europe through 1986. Foster left Bronski Beat after their second album, and the band were joined by Jonathan Hellyer before dissolving in 1995.

Steve Bronski revived the band in 2016, recording new material with 1990s member Ian Donaldson. Steinbachek died later that year; Bronski died in 2021. As of 2025, Somerville is the last surviving member of the band&#x27;s original lineup and one of six surviving members of the band. 

==History==

===1983–1985: early years and &quot;The Age of Consent&quot;===

Bronski Beat formed in 1983 when Jimmy Somerville, Steve Bronski (both from Glasgow) and Larry Steinbachek (from Southend, Essex) shared a three-bedroom flat at Lancaster House in Brixton, London. Steinbachek had heard Somerville singing during the making of &quot;Framed Youth: The Revenge of the Teenage Perverts&quot; and suggested they make some music. They first performed publicly at an arts festival, &quot;September in the Pink&quot;. The trio were unhappy with the inoffensive nature of contemporary gay performers and sought to be more outspoken and political.

Bronski Beat signed a recording contract with London Records in 1984 after doing only nine live gigs. The band&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Smalltown Boy&quot;, about a gay teenager leaving his family and fleeing his home town, was a hit, peaking at No 3 in the UK Singles Chart, and topping charts in Belgium and the Netherlands. The single was accompanied by a promotional video directed by Bernard Rose, showing Somerville trying to befriend an attractive diver at a swimming pool, then being attacked by the diver&#x27;s homophobic associates, being returned to his family by the police and having to leave home. (The police officer was played by Colin Bell, then the marketing manager of London Records.) &quot;Smalltown Boy&quot; reached 48 in the U.S. chart and peaked at 8 in Australia.

The follow-up single, &quot;Why?&quot;, adopted a hi-NRG sound and was more lyrically focused on anti-gay prejudice. It also achieved Top 10 status in the UK, reaching 6, and was another Top 10 hit for the band in Australia, Switzerland, Germany, France and the Netherlands.

At the end of 1984, the trio released an album titled &quot;The Age of Consent&quot;. The inner sleeve listed the varying ages of consent for consensual gay sex in different nations around the world. At the time, the age of consent for sexual acts between men in the UK was 21 compared with 16 for heterosexual acts, with several other countries having more liberal laws on gay sex. The album peaked at 4 in the UK Albums Chart, 36 in the U.S., and 12 in Australia.

Around the same time, the band headlined &quot;Pits and Perverts&quot;, a concert at the Electric Ballroom in London to raise funds for the Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners campaign. This event is featured in the film &quot;Pride&quot;.

The third single, released before Christmas 1984, was a revival of &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Necessarily So&quot;, the George and Ira Gershwin classic (from &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;). The song questions the accuracy of biblical tales. It also reached the UK Top 20.

In 1985, the trio joined up with Marc Almond to record a version of Donna Summer&#x27;s &quot;I Feel Love&quot;. The full version was actually a medley that also incorporated snippets of Summer&#x27;s &quot;Love to Love You Baby&quot; and John Leyton&#x27;s &quot;Johnny Remember Me&quot;. It was a big success, reaching 3 in the UK and equalling the chart achievement of &quot;Smalltown Boy&quot;. Although the original had been one of Marc Almond&#x27;s all-time favourite songs, he had never read the lyrics and thus incorrectly sang &quot;What’ll it be, what’ll it be, you and me&quot; instead of &quot;Falling free, falling free, falling free&quot; on the finished record.

The band and their producer Mike Thorne had gone back into the studio in early 1985 to record a new single, &quot;Run from Love&quot;, and PolyGram (London Records&#x27; parent company at that time) had pressed a number of promo singles and 12&quot; versions of the song and sent them to radio and record stores in the UK. However, the single was shelved as tensions in the band, both personal and political, resulted in Somerville leaving Bronski Beat in the summer of that year.

&quot;Run from Love&quot; was subsequently released in remix form on the Bronski Beat album &quot;Hundreds &amp; Thousands&quot;, a collection of mostly remixes (LP) and B-sides (as bonus tracks on the CD version) as well as the hit &quot;I Feel Love&quot;. Somerville went on to form the Communards with Richard Coles while the remaining members of Bronski Beat searched for a new vocalist.

===1985–1995: Somerville&#x27;s departure, John Foster and Jonathan Hellyer eras===
Bronski Beat recruited John Foster as Somerville&#x27;s replacement (Foster is credited as &quot;Jon Jon&quot;). A single, &quot;Hit That Perfect Beat&quot;, was released in November 1985, reaching 3 in the UK. It repeated this success on the Australian chart and was also featured in the film &quot;Letter to Brezhnev&quot;. A second single, &quot;C&#x27;mon C&#x27;mon&quot;, also charted in the UK Top 20 and an album, &quot;Truthdare Doubledare&quot;, released in May 1986, peaked at 18. The film &quot;Parting Glances&quot; (1986) included Bronski Beat songs &quot;Love and Money&quot;, &quot;Smalltown Boy&quot; and &quot;Why?&quot; During this period, the band teamed up with producer Mark Cunningham on the first-ever BBC Children In Need single, a cover of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Heroes&quot;, released in 1986 under the name of The County Line.

Foster left the band in 1987. Following Foster&#x27;s departure, Bronski Beat began work on their next album, &quot;Out and About&quot;. The tracks were recorded at Berry Street studios in London with engineer Brian Pugsley. Some of the song titles were &quot;The Final Spin&quot; and &quot;Peace and Love&quot;. The latter track featured Strawberry Switchblade vocalist Rose McDowall and appeared on several internet sites in 2006. One of the other songs from the project called &quot;European Boy&quot; was recorded in 1987 by disco group Splash. The lead singer of Splash was former Tight Fit singer Steve Grant. Steinbachek and Bronski toured extensively with the new material with positive reviews, however the project was abandoned as the group was dropped by London Records. Also in 1987, Bronski Beat and Somerville performed at a reunion concert for &quot;International AIDS Day&quot;, supported by New Order, at the Brixton Academy, London.

In 1989, Jonathan Hellyer became lead singer, and the band extensively toured the U.S. and Europe with back-up vocalist Annie Conway. They achieved one minor hit with the song &quot;Cha Cha Heels&quot;, a one-off collaboration sung by American actress and singer Eartha Kitt, which peaked at 32 in the UK. The song was originally written for movie and recording star Divine, who was unable to record the song before his death in 1988. 1990–91 saw Bronski Beat release three further singles on the Zomba record label, &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Run Away&quot;, &quot;One More Chance&quot; and &quot;What More Can I Say&quot;. The singles were produced by Mike Thorne.

Foster and Bronski Beat teamed up again in 1994, and released a techno &quot;Tell Me Why &#x27;94&quot; and an acoustic &quot;Smalltown Boy &#x27;94&quot; on the German record label, ZYX Music. The album &quot;Rainbow Nation&quot; was released the following year with Hellyer returning as lead vocalist, as Foster had dropped out of the project and Ian Donaldson was brought on board to do keyboards and programming. After a few years of touring, Bronski Beat then dissolved, with Steve Bronski going on to become a producer for other artists and Ian Donaldson becoming a successful DJ (Sordid Soundz). Larry Steinbachek became the musical director for Michael Laub&#x27;s theatre company, &#x27;Remote Control Productions&#x27;.

===2007–2016: Bronski solo activities and resurrection of Bronski Beat===

In 2007, Steve Bronski remixed the song &quot;Stranger to None&quot; by the UK alternative rock band, All Living Fear. Four different mixes were made, with one appearing on their retrospective album, &quot;Fifteen Years After&quot;. Bronski also remixed the track &quot;Flowers in the Morning&quot; by Northern Irish electronic band Electrobronze in 2007, changing the style of the song from classical to Hi-NRG disco.

In 2015, Steve Bronski teamed up as a one-off with Jessica James (aka Barbara Bush) and said that she reminded him of Divine, because of her look and Eartha Kitt-like sound. The one-off project was to cover the track he made in 1989.

In 2016, Steve Bronski again teamed up with Ian Donaldson, with the aim of bringing Bronski Beat back, enlisting a new singer, Stephen Granville. In 2017, the new Bronski Beat released a reworked version of &quot;Age of Consent&quot; entitled &quot;Age of Reason&quot;. &quot;Out &amp; About&quot;, the unreleased Bronski Beat album from 1987, was released digitally via Steve Bronski&#x27;s website. The album features the original tracks plus remixes by Bronski.

===2017–present: deaths of Steinbachek and Bronski===
On 12 January 2017, it was revealed that Steinbachek had died the previous month after a short battle with cancer, with his family and friends at his bedside. He was 56. Bronski died on 7 December 2021, at the age of 61, in a Central London flat fire.

<doc id="4077" wikidata="Q6583973" url="?curid=4077" title="Binary prefix">
<text>A binary prefix is a unit prefix that indicates a multiple of a unit of measurement by an integer power of two. The most commonly used binary prefixes are kibi (symbol Ki, meaning ), mebi (), and gibi (). They are most often used in information technology as multipliers of bit and byte, when expressing the capacity of storage devices or the size of computer files.

The binary prefixes &quot;kibi&quot;, &quot;mebi&quot;, etc. were defined in 1999 by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), in the IEC 60027-2 standard (Amendment 2). They were meant to replace the metric (SI) decimal power prefixes, such as &quot;kilo&quot; (), &quot;mega&quot; () and &quot;giga&quot; (), that were commonly used in the computer industry to indicate the nearest powers of two. For example, a memory module whose capacity was specified by the manufacturer as &quot;2 megabytes&quot; or &quot;2 MB&quot; would hold = , instead of = .

On the other hand, a hard disk whose capacity is specified by the manufacturer as &quot;10 gigabytes&quot; or &quot;10 GB&quot;, holds = bytes, or a little more than that, but less than = and a file whose size is listed as &quot;2.3 GB&quot; may have a size closer to ≈ or to = , depending on the program or operating system providing that measurement. This kind of ambiguity is often confusing to computer system users and has resulted in lawsuits. The IEC 60027-2 binary prefixes have been incorporated in the ISO/IEC 80000 standard and are supported by other standards bodies, including the BIPM, which defines the SI system, the US NIST, and the European Union.

Prior to the 1999 IEC standard, some industry organizations, such as the Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC), attempted to redefine the terms &quot;kilobyte&quot;, &quot;megabyte&quot;, and &quot;gigabyte&quot;, and the corresponding symbols &quot;KB&quot;, &quot;MB&quot;, and &quot;GB&quot; in the binary sense, for use in storage capacity measurements. However, other computer industry sectors (such as magnetic storage) continued using those same terms and symbols with the decimal meaning. Since then, the major standards organizations have expressly disapproved the use of SI prefixes to denote binary multiples, and recommended or mandated the use of the IEC prefixes for that purpose, but the use of SI prefixes in this sense has persisted in some fields.

== Definitions ==


In 2022, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) adopted the decimal prefixes &quot;ronna&quot; for 10009 and &quot;quetta&quot; for 100010. In 2025, the prefixes &quot;robi&quot; () and &quot;quebi&quot; () were adopted by the IEC.

== Comparison of binary and decimal prefixes ==
The relative difference between the values in the binary and decimal interpretations increases, when using the SI prefixes as the base, from 2.4% for kilo to nearly 27% for the quetta prefix.

== History ==
=== Early prefixes ===
The original metric system adopted by France in 1795 included two binary prefixes named &quot;double-&quot; (2×) and &quot;demi-&quot; (×). However, these were not retained when the SI prefixes were internationally adopted by the 11th CGPM conference in 1960.

=== Storage capacity ===
==== Main memory ====
Early computers used one of two addressing methods to access the system memory; binary (base 2) or decimal (base 10). For example, the IBM 701 (1952) used a binary methods and could address 2048 words of 36 bits each, while the IBM 702 (1953) used a decimal system, and could address ten thousand 7-bit words.

By the mid-1960s, binary addressing had become the standard architecture in most computer designs, and main memory sizes were most commonly powers of two. This is the most natural configuration for memory, as all combinations of states of their address lines map to a valid address, allowing easy aggregation into a larger block of memory with contiguous addresses.

While early documentation specified those memory sizes as exact numbers such as 4096, 8192, or units (usually words, bytes, or bits), computer professionals also started using the long-established metric system prefixes &quot;kilo&quot;, &quot;mega&quot;, &quot;giga&quot;, etc., defined to be powers of 10, to mean instead the nearest powers of two; namely, 210 = 1024, 220 = 10242, 230 = 10243, etc. The corresponding metric prefix symbols (&quot;k&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, etc.) were used with the same binary meanings. The symbol for 210 = 1024 could be written either in lower case (&quot;k&quot;) or in uppercase (&quot;K&quot;). The latter was often used intentionally to indicate the binary rather than decimal meaning. This convention, which could not be extended to higher powers, was widely used in the documentation of the IBM 360 (1964) and of the IBM System/370 (1972), of the CDC 7600, of the DEC PDP-11/70 (1975) and of the DEC VAX-11/780 (1977).

In other documents, however, the metric prefixes and their symbols were used to denote powers of 10, but usually with the understanding that the values given were approximate, often truncated down. Thus, for example, a 1967 document by Control Data Corporation (CDC) abbreviated &quot;216 = = words&quot; as &quot;65K words&quot; (rather than &quot;64K&quot; or &quot;66K&quot;), while the documentation of the HP 21MX real-time computer (1974) denoted = = as &quot;196K&quot; and 220 = as &quot;1M&quot;.

These three possible meanings of &quot;k&quot; and &quot;K&quot; (&quot;1024&quot;, &quot;1000&quot;, or &quot;approximately 1000&quot;) were used loosely around the same time, sometimes by the same company. The HP 3000 business computer (1973) could have &quot;64K&quot;, &quot;96K&quot;, or &quot;128K&quot; bytes of memory. The use of SI prefixes, and the use of &quot;K&quot; instead of &quot;k&quot; remained popular in computer-related publications well into the 21st century, although the ambiguity persisted. The correct meaning was often clear from the context; for instance, in a binary-addressed computer, the true memory size had to be either a power of 2, or a small integer multiple thereof. Thus a &quot;512 megabyte&quot; RAM module was generally understood to have = bytes, rather than .

==== Hard disks ====
In specifying disk drive capacities, manufacturers have always used conventional decimal SI prefixes representing powers of 10. Storage in a rotating disk drive is organized in platters and tracks whose sizes and counts are determined by mechanical engineering constraints so that the capacity of a disk drive has hardly ever been a simple multiple of a power of 2. For example, the first commercially sold disk drive, the IBM 350 (1956), had 50 physical disk platters containing a total of sectors of 100 characters each, for a total quoted capacity of 5 million characters.

Moreover, since the 1960s, many disk drives used IBM&#x27;s disk format, where each track was divided into blocks of user-specified size; and the block sizes were recorded on the disk, subtracting from the usable capacity. For example, the IBM 3336 disk pack was quoted to have a 200-megabyte capacity, achieved only with a single -byte block in each of its 808 × 19 tracks.

Decimal megabytes were used for disk capacity by the CDC in 1974. The Seagate ST-412, one of several types installed in the IBM PC/XT, had a capacity of when formatted as 306 × 4 tracks and 32 256-byte sectors per track, which was quoted as &quot;10 MB&quot;. Similarly, a &quot;300 GB&quot; hard drive can be expected to offer only slightly more than = , bytes, not (which would be about bytes or &quot;322 GB&quot;). The first terabyte (SI prefix, bytes) hard disk drive was introduced in 2007. Decimal prefixes were generally used by information processing publications when comparing hard disk capacities.

Some programs and operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows, still use &quot;MB&quot; and &quot;GB&quot; to denote binary prefixes even when displaying disk drive capacities and file sizes, as did Classic Mac OS. Thus, for example, the capacity of a &quot;10 MB&quot; (decimal &quot;M&quot;) disk drive could be reported as &quot;&quot;, and that of a &quot;300 GB&quot; drive as &quot;279.4 GB&quot;. Some operating systems, such as Mac OS X, Ubuntu, and Debian, have been updated to use &quot;MB&quot; and &quot;GB&quot; to denote decimal prefixes when displaying disk drive capacities and file sizes. Some manufacturers, such as Seagate Technology, have released recommendations stating that properly-written software and documentation should specify clearly whether prefixes such as &quot;K&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, or &quot;G&quot; mean binary or decimal multipliers.

==== Floppy disks ====
Floppy disks used a variety of formats, and their capacities was usually specified with SI-like prefixes &quot;K&quot; and &quot;M&quot; with either decimal or binary meaning. The capacity of the disks was often specified without accounting for the internal formatting overhead, leading to more irregularities.

The early 8-inch diskette formats could contain less than a megabyte with the capacities of those devices specified in kilobytes, kilobits or megabits.

The 5.25-inch diskette sold with the IBM PC AT could hold = bytes, and thus was marketed as &quot;1200 KB&quot; with the binary sense of &quot;KB&quot;. However, the capacity was also quoted &quot;1.2 MB&quot;, which was a hybrid decimal and binary notation, since the &quot;M&quot; meant 1000 × 1024. The precise value was (decimal) or (binary).

The 5.25-inch Apple Disk II had 256 bytes per sector, 13 sectors per track, 35 tracks per side, or a total capacity of bytes. It was later upgraded to 16 sectors per track, giving a total of = bytes, which was described as &quot;140KB&quot; using the binary sense of &quot;K&quot;.

The most recent version of the physical hardware, the &quot;3.5-inch diskette&quot; cartridge, had 720 512-byte blocks (single-sided). Since two blocks comprised 1024 bytes, the capacity was quoted &quot;360 KB&quot;, with the binary sense of &quot;K&quot;. On the other hand, the quoted capacity of &quot;1.44 MB&quot; of the High Density (&quot;HD&quot;) version was again a hybrid decimal and binary notation, since it meant 1440 pairs of 512-byte sectors, or = . Some operating systems displayed the capacity of those disks using the binary sense of &quot;MB&quot;, as &quot;1.4 MB&quot; (which would be ≈ ). User complaints forced both Apple and Microsoft to issue support bulletins explaining the discrepancy.

==== Optical disks ====
When specifying the capacities of optical compact discs, &quot;megabyte&quot; and &quot;MB&quot; usually meant 10242 bytes. Thus a &quot;700-MB&quot; (or &quot;80-minute&quot;) CD has a nominal capacity of about , which is approximately (decimal).

On the other hand, capacities of other optical disc storage media like DVD, Blu-ray Disc, HD DVD and magneto-optical (MO) have been generally specified in decimal gigabytes (&quot;GB&quot;), that is, 10003 bytes. In particular, a typical &quot;&quot; DVD has a nominal capacity of about , which is about .

==== Tape drives and media ====
Tape drive and media manufacturers have generally used SI decimal prefixes to specify the maximum capacity, although the actual capacity would depend on the block size used when recording.

==== Data and clock rates ====
Computer clock frequencies are always quoted using SI prefixes in their decimal sense. For example, the internal clock frequency of the original IBM PC was , that is .

Similarly, digital information transfer rates are quoted using decimal prefixe. The Parallel ATA &quot; disk interface can transfer bytes per second, and a &quot; modem transmits bits per second. Seagate specified the sustained transfer rate of some hard disk drive models with both decimal and IEC binary prefixes. 
The standard sampling rate of music compact disks, quoted as , is indeed samples per second. A &quot;&quot; Ethernet interface can receive or transmit up to 109 bits per second, or bytes per second within each packet. A &quot;56k&quot; modem can encode or decode up to bits per second.

Decimal SI prefixes are also generally used for processor-memory data transfer speeds. A PCI-X bus with clock and 64 bits wide can transfer 64-bit words per second, or = , which is usually quoted as . A PC3200 memory on a double data rate bus, transferring 8 bytes per cycle with a clock speed of has a bandwidth of = , which would be quoted as .

=== Ambiguous standards ===
The ambiguous usage of the prefixes &quot;kilo (&quot;K&quot; or &quot;k&quot;), &quot;mega&quot; (&quot;M&quot;), and &quot;giga&quot; (&quot;G&quot;), as meaning both powers of 1000 or (in computer contexts) of 1024, has been recorded in popular dictionaries, and even in some obsolete standards, such as ANSI/IEEE 1084-1986 and ANSI/IEEE 1212-1991, IEEE 610.10-1994, and IEEE 100-2000. Some of these standards specifically limited the binary meaning to multiples of &quot;byte&quot; (&quot;B&quot;) or &quot;bit&quot; (&quot;b&quot;).

=== Early binary prefix proposals ===
Before the IEC standard, several alternative proposals existed for unique binary prefixes, starting in the late 1960s. In 1996, Markus Kuhn proposed the extra prefix &quot;di&quot; and the symbol suffix or subscript &quot;2&quot; to mean &quot;binary&quot;; so that, for example, &quot;one dikilobyte&quot; would mean &quot;1024 bytes&quot;, denoted &quot;K2B&quot; or &quot;K2B&quot;.

In 1968, Donald Morrison proposed to use the Greek letter kappa (κ) to denote 1024, κ2 to denote 10242, and so on. (At the time, memory size was small, and only K was in widespread use.) In the same year, Wallace Givens responded with a suggestion to use bK as an abbreviation for 1024 and bK2 or bK2 for 10242, though he noted that neither the Greek letter nor lowercase letter b would be easy to reproduce on computer printers of the day. Bruce Alan Martin of Brookhaven National Laboratory proposed that, instead of prefixes, binary powers of two were indicated by the letter B followed by the exponent, similar to E in decimal scientific notation. Thus one would write 3B20 for . This convention is still used on some calculators to present binary floating point-numbers today.

In 1969, Donald Knuth, who uses decimal notation like 1 MB = 1000 kB, proposed that the powers of 1024 be designated as &quot;large kilobytes&quot; and &quot;large megabytes&quot;, with abbreviations KKB and MMB.

=== Consumer confusion ===
The ambiguous meanings of &quot;kilo&quot;, &quot;mega&quot;, &quot;giga&quot;, etc., has caused significant consumer confusion, especially in the personal computer era. A common source of confusion was the discrepancy between the capacities of hard drives specified by manufacturers, using those prefixes in the decimal sense, and the numbers reported by operating systems and other software, that used them in the binary sense, such as the Apple Macintosh in 1984. For example, a hard drive marketed as &quot;1 TB&quot; could be reported as having only &quot;931 GB&quot;. The confusion was compounded by fact that RAM manufacturers used the binary sense too.

=== Legal disputes ===
The different interpretations of disk size prefixes led to class action lawsuits against digital storage manufacturers. These cases involved both flash memory and hard disk drives.

==== Early cases ====
Early cases (2004–2007) were settled prior to any court ruling with the manufacturers admitting no wrongdoing but agreeing to clarify the storage capacity of their products on the consumer packaging. Accordingly, many flash memory and hard disk manufacturers have disclosures on their packaging and web sites clarifying the formatted capacity of the devices or defining MB as 1 million bytes and 1 GB as 1 billion bytes.

==== &quot;Willem Vroegh v. Eastman Kodak Company&quot; ====
On 20 February 2004, Willem Vroegh filed a lawsuit against Lexar Media, Dane–Elec Memory, Fuji Photo Film USA, Eastman Kodak Company, Kingston Technology Company, Inc., Memorex Products, Inc.; PNY Technologies Inc., SanDisk Corporation, Verbatim Corporation, and Viking Interworks alleging that their descriptions of the capacity of their flash memory cards were false and misleading.

Vroegh claimed that a 256 MB Flash Memory Device had only 244 MB of accessible memory. &quot;Plaintiffs allege that Defendants marketed the memory capacity of their products by assuming that one megabyte equals one million bytes and one gigabyte equals one billion bytes.&quot; The plaintiffs wanted the defendants to use the customary values of 10242 for megabyte and 10243 for gigabyte. The plaintiffs acknowledged that the IEC and IEEE standards define a MB as one million bytes but stated that the industry has largely ignored the IEC standards.

The parties agreed that manufacturers could continue to use the decimal definition so long as the definition was added to the packaging and web sites. The consumers could apply for &quot;a discount of ten percent off a future online purchase from Defendants&#x27; Online Stores Flash Memory Device&quot;.

==== &quot;Orin Safier v. Western Digital Corporation&quot; ====
On 7 July 2005, an action entitled &quot;Orin Safier v. Western Digital Corporation, et al.&quot; was filed in the Superior Court for the City and County of San Francisco, Case No. CGC-05-442812. The case was subsequently moved to the Northern District of California, Case No. 05-03353 BZ.

Although Western Digital maintained that their usage of units is consistent with &quot;the indisputably correct industry standard for measuring and describing storage capacity&quot;, and that they &quot;cannot be expected to reform the software industry&quot;, they agreed to settle in March 2006 with 14 June 2006 as the Final Approval hearing date.

Western Digital offered to compensate customers with a gratis download of backup and recovery software that they valued at US$30. They also paid in fees and expenses to San Francisco lawyers Adam Gutride and Seth Safier, who filed the suit. The settlement called for Western Digital to add a disclaimer to their later packaging and advertising.

Western Digital had this footnote in their settlement. &quot;Apparently, Plaintiff believes that he could sue an egg company for fraud for labeling a carton of 12 eggs a &#x27;dozen&#x27;, because some bakers would view a &#x27;dozen&#x27; as including 13 items.&quot;

==== &quot;Cho v. Seagate Technology (US) Holdings, Inc.&quot; ====
A lawsuit (&quot;Cho v. Seagate Technology (US) Holdings, Inc.&quot;, San Francisco Superior Court, Case No. CGC-06-453195) was filed against Seagate Technology, alleging that Seagate overrepresented the amount of usable storage by 7% on hard drives sold between 22 March 2001 and 26 September 2007. The case was settled without Seagate admitting wrongdoing, but agreeing to supply those purchasers with gratis backup software or a 5% refund on the cost of the drives.

==== &quot;Dinan et al. v. SanDisk LLC&quot; ====
On 22 January 2020, the district court of the Northern District of California ruled in favor of the defendant, SanDisk, upholding its use of &quot;GB&quot; to mean .

=== IEC 1999 Standard ===
In 1995, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry&#x27;s (IUPAC) Interdivisional Committee on Nomenclature and Symbols (IDCNS) proposed the prefixes &quot;kibi&quot; (short for &quot;kilobinary&quot;), &quot;mebi&quot; (&quot;megabinary&quot;), &quot;gibi&quot; (&quot;gigabinary&quot;) and &quot;tebi&quot; (&quot;terabinary&quot;), with respective symbols &quot;kb&quot;, &quot;Mb&quot;, &quot;Gb&quot; and &quot;Tb&quot;, for binary multipliers. The proposal suggested that the SI prefixes should be used only for powers of 10; so that a disk drive capacity of &quot;500 gigabytes&quot;, &quot;0.5 terabytes&quot;, &quot;500 GB&quot;, or &quot;0.5 TB&quot; should all mean , exactly or approximately, rather than (= ) or (= ).

The proposal was not accepted by IUPAC at the time, but was taken up in 1996 by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in collaboration with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). The prefixes &quot;kibi&quot;, &quot;mebi&quot;, &quot;gibi&quot; and &quot;tebi&quot; were retained, but with the symbols &quot;Ki&quot; (with capital &quot;K&quot;), &quot;Mi&quot;, &quot;Gi&quot; and &quot;Ti&quot; respectively.

In January 1999, the IEC published this proposal, with additional prefixes &quot;pebi&quot; (&quot;Pi&quot;) and &quot;exbi&quot; (&quot;Ei&quot;), as an international standard (IEC 60027-2 Amendment 2) The standard reaffirmed the BIPM&#x27;s position that the SI prefixes should always denote powers of 10. The third edition of the standard, published in 2005, added prefixes &quot;zebi&quot; and &quot;yobi&quot;, thus matching all then-defined SI prefixes with binary counterparts.

The harmonized ISO/IEC IEC 80000-13:2025 standard cancels and replaces subclauses 3.8 and 3.9 of IEC 60027-2:2005 (those defining prefixes for binary multiples). The only significant change is the addition of explicit definitions for some quantities. In 2009, the prefixes kibi-, mebi-, etc. were defined by ISO 80000-1 in their own right, independently of the kibibyte, mebibyte, and so on.

The BIPM standard JCGM 200:2012 &quot;International vocabulary of metrology – Basic and general concepts and associated terms (VIM), 3rd edition&quot; lists the IEC binary prefixes and states &quot;SI prefixes refer strictly to powers of 10, and should not be used for powers of 2. For example, 1 kilobit should not be used to represent bits (210 bits), which is 1 kibibit.&quot;

The IEC 60027-2 standard recommended operating systems and other software were updated to use binary or decimal prefixes consistently, but incorrect usage of SI prefixes for binary multiples is still common. At the time, the IEEE decided that their standards would use the prefixes &quot;kilo&quot;, etc. with their metric definitions, but allowed the binary definitions to be used in an interim period as long as such usage was explicitly pointed out on a case-by-case basis.

==== Other standards bodies and organizations ====
The IEC standard binary prefixes are supported by other standardization bodies and technical organizations.

The United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) supports the ISO/IEC standards for
&quot;Prefixes for binary multiples&quot; and has a web page documenting them, describing and justifying their use. NIST suggests that in English, the first syllable of the name of the binary-multiple prefix should be pronounced in the same way as the first syllable of the name of the corresponding SI prefix, and that the second syllable should be pronounced as &quot;bee&quot;. NIST has stated the SI prefixes &quot;refer strictly to powers of 10&quot; and that the binary definitions &quot;should not be used&quot; for them.

As of 2014, the microelectronics industry standards body JEDEC describes the IEC prefixes in its online dictionary, but acknowledges that the SI prefixes and the symbols &quot;K&quot;, &quot;M&quot; and &quot;G&quot; are still commonly used with the binary sense for memory sizes.

On 19 March 2005, the IEEE standard IEEE 1541-2002 (&quot;Prefixes for Binary Multiples&quot;) was elevated to a full-use standard by the IEEE Standards Association after a two-year trial period. , the IEEE Publications division does not require the use of IEC prefixes in its major magazines such as &quot;Spectrum&quot; or &quot;Computer&quot;. 

The International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM), which maintains the International System of Units (SI), expressly prohibits the use of SI prefixes to denote binary multiples, and recommends the use of the IEC prefixes as an alternative since units of information are not included in the SI.

The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) prohibits the use of SI prefixes with anything but a power-of-1000 meaning, but does not cite the IEC binary prefixes.

The European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC) adopted the IEC-recommended binary prefixes via the harmonization document HD 60027-2:2003-03. The European Union (EU) has required the use of the IEC binary prefixes since 2007.

=== Current practice ===


Some computer industry participants, such as Hewlett-Packard (HP), and IBM have adopted or recommended IEC binary prefixes as part of their general documentation policies.

As of 2023, the use of SI prefixes with the binary meanings is still prevalent for specifying the capacity of the main memory of computers, of RAM, ROM, EPROM, and EEPROM chips and memory modules, and of the cache of computer processors. For example, a &quot;512-megabyte&quot; or &quot;512 MB&quot; memory module holds 512 MiB; that is, 512 × 220 bytes, not 512 × 106 bytes.

JEDEC continues to include the customary binary definitions of &quot;kilo&quot;, &quot;mega&quot;, and &quot;giga&quot; in the document &quot;Terms, Definitions, and Letter Symbols&quot;, and, , still used those definitions in their memory standards.

On the other hand, the SI prefixes with powers of ten meanings are generally used for the capacity of external storage units, such as disk drives, solid state drives, and USB flash drives, except for some flash memory chips intended to be used as EEPROMs. However, some disk manufacturers have used the IEC prefixes to avoid confusion. The decimal meaning of SI prefixes is usually also intended in measurements of data transfer rates, and clock speeds.

Some operating systems and other software use either the IEC binary multiplier symbols (&quot;Ki&quot;, &quot;Mi&quot;, etc.) or the SI multiplier symbols (&quot;k&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, etc.) with decimal meaning. Some programs, such as the GNU ls command, let the user choose between binary or decimal multipliers. However, some continue to use the SI symbols with the binary meanings, even when reporting disk or file sizes. Some programs may also use &quot;K&quot; instead of &quot;k&quot;, with either meaning.

== Other uses ==
While the binary prefixes are predominantly used with units of data, bits and bytes, they may be used with other unit of measure. For example, in signal processing it may be convenient to use a binary prefix with the unit of frequency, hertz (Hz), to produce a unit such as the kibihertz (KiHz), which is equal to .

<text>The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum is a history museum and hall of fame in Cooperstown, New York, operated by a private foundation. It serves as the central collection and gathering space for the history of baseball in the United States displaying baseball-related artifacts and exhibits, honoring those who have excelled in playing, managing, and serving the sport. The Hall&#x27;s motto is &quot;Preserving History, Honoring Excellence, Connecting Generations&quot;. Cooperstown is often used as shorthand (or a metonym) for the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. The museum also established and manages the process for honorees into the Hall of Fame.

The Hall of Fame was established in 1939 by Stephen Carlton Clark, an heir to the Singer Sewing Machine fortune. Clark sought to bring tourists to the village hurt by the Great Depression, which reduced the local tourist trade, and Prohibition, which devastated the local hops industry. Clark constructed the Hall of Fame&#x27;s building, which was dedicated on June 12, 1939. (His granddaughter, Jane Forbes Clark, is the current chairman of the board of directors.) The mythology that future Civil War hero Abner Doubleday invented baseball in Cooperstown in the 1830s was instrumental in the placement and early marketing of the Hall.

An expanded library and research facility opened in 1994. Dale Petroskey became the organization&#x27;s president in 1999. In 2002, the Hall launched &quot;Baseball as America&quot;, a traveling exhibit that toured ten American museums over six years. The Hall of Fame has since also sponsored educational programming on the Internet to bring the Hall of Fame to schoolchildren who might not visit. The Hall and Museum completed a series of renovations in spring 2005. The Hall of Fame also presents an annual exhibit at FanFest at the Major League Baseball All-Star Game.

==Inductees==
Among baseball fans, &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; means not only the museum and facility in Cooperstown, New York, but the pantheon of players, managers, umpires, executives, and pioneers who have been inducted into the Hall. The first five men elected were Ty Cobb, Babe Ruth, Honus Wagner, Christy Mathewson and Walter Johnson, chosen in 1936; roughly 20 more were selected before the entire group was inducted at the Hall&#x27;s 1939 opening. , 351 people had been elected to the Hall of Fame, including 278 former professional players, 23 managers, 10 umpires, and 40 pioneers, executives, and organizers. 119 members of the Hall of Fame have been inducted posthumously, including four who died after their selection was announced. Of the 39 members primarily recognized for their contributions to Negro league baseball, 31 were inducted posthumously, including all 26 selected since the 1990s. The Hall of Fame includes one woman, baseball executive Effa Manley.

The newest members of the Hall of Fame as of January 21, 2025, are Dick Allen, Dave Parker, CC Sabathia, Ichiro Suzuki, and Billy Wagner.

In 2019, former Yankees closer Mariano Rivera became the first player to be elected unanimously on the writers&#x27; ballot. Derek Jeter, Marvin Miller, Ted Simmons, and Larry Walker were to be inducted in 2020, but their induction ceremony was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic until September 8, 2021. The ceremony was open to the public, as COVID restrictions had been lifted.

===Selection process===
Players are currently inducted into the Hall of Fame through election by either the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (or BBWAA), or the Veterans Committee, which now consists of four subcommittees, each of which considers and votes for candidates from a separate era of baseball. Five years after retirement, any player with 10 years of major league experience who passes a screening committee (which removes from consideration players of clearly lesser qualification) is eligible to be elected by BBWAA members with 10 years&#x27; membership or more who also have been actively covering MLB at any time in the 10 years preceding the election (the latter requirement was added for the 2016 election). From a final ballot typically including 25–40 candidates, each writer may vote for up to 10 players; until the late 1950s, voters were advised to cast votes for the maximum 10 candidates. Any player named on 75% or more of all ballots cast is elected. A player who is named on fewer than 5% of ballots is dropped from future elections. In some instances, the screening committee had restored their names to later ballots, but in the mid-1990s, dropped players were made permanently ineligible for Hall of Fame consideration, even by the Veterans Committee. A 2001 change in the election procedures restored the eligibility of these dropped players; while their names will not appear on future BBWAA ballots, they may be considered by the Veterans Committee. Players receiving 5% or more of the votes but fewer than 75% are reconsidered annually until a maximum of ten years of eligibility (lowered from fifteen years for the 2015 election).
Under special circumstances, certain players may be deemed eligible for induction even though they have not met all requirements. Addie Joss was elected in 1978, despite only playing nine seasons before he died of meningitis. Additionally, if an otherwise eligible player dies before his fifth year of retirement, then that player may be placed on the ballot at the first election at least six months after his death. Roberto Clemente set the precedent: the writers put him up for consideration after his death on New Year&#x27;s Eve, 1972, and he was inducted in 1973.

The five-year waiting period was established in 1954 after an evolutionary process. In 1936 all players were eligible, including active ones. From the 1937 election until the 1945 election, there was no waiting period, so any retired player was eligible, but writers were discouraged from voting for current major leaguers. Since there was no formal rule preventing a writer from casting a ballot for an active player, the scribes did not always comply with the informal guideline; Joe DiMaggio received a vote in 1945, for example. From the 1946 election until the 1954 election, an official one-year waiting period was in effect. (DiMaggio, for example, retired after the 1951 season and was first eligible in the 1953 election.) The modern rule establishing a wait of five years was passed in 1954, although those who had already been eligible under the old rule were grandfathered into the ballot, thus permitting Joe DiMaggio to be elected within four years of his retirement.
Contrary to popular belief, no formal exception was made for Lou Gehrig (other than to hold a special one-man election for him): there was no waiting period at that time, and Gehrig met all other qualifications, so he would have been eligible for the next regular election after he retired during the 1939 season. However, the BBWAA decided to hold a special election at the 1939 Winter Meetings in Cincinnati, specifically to elect Gehrig (most likely because it was known that he was terminally ill, making it uncertain that he would live long enough to see another election). Nobody else was on that ballot, and the numerical results have never been made public. Since no elections were held in 1940 or 1941, the special election permitted Gehrig to enter the Hall while still alive.

If a player fails to be elected by the BBWAA within 10 years of his eligibility for election, he may be selected by the Veterans Committee. Following changes to the election process for that body made in 2010 and 2016, the Veterans Committee is now responsible for electing all otherwise eligible candidates who are not eligible for the BBWAA ballot — both long-retired players and non-playing personnel (managers, umpires, and executives). From 2011 to 2016, each candidate could be considered once every three years; now, the frequency depends on the era in which an individual made his greatest contributions. A more complete discussion of the new process is available below.

From 2008 to 2010, following changes made by the Hall in July 2007, the main Veterans Committee, then made up of living Hall of Famers, voted only on players whose careers began in 1943 or later. These changes also established three separate committees to select other figures:
*One committee voted on managers and umpires for induction in every even-numbered year. This committee voted only twice—in 2007 for induction in 2008 and in 2009 for induction in 2010.
*One committee voted on executives and builders for induction in every even-numbered year. This committee conducted its only two votes in the same years as the managers/umpires committee.
*The pre–World War II players committee was intended to vote every five years on players whose careers began in 1942 or earlier. It conducted its only vote as part of the election process for induction in 2009.
Players of the Negro leagues have also been considered at various times, beginning in 1971. In 2005, the Hall completed a study on African American players between the late 19th century and the integration of the major leagues in 1947, and conducted a special election for such players in February 2006; seventeen figures from the Negro leagues were chosen in that election, in addition to the eighteen previously selected. Following the 2010 changes, Negro leagues figures were primarily considered for induction alongside other figures from the 1871–1946 era, called the &quot;Pre-Integration Era&quot; by the Hall; since 2016, Negro leagues figures are primarily considered alongside other figures from what the Hall calls the &quot;Early Baseball&quot; era (1871–1949).

Predictably, the selection process catalyzes endless debate among baseball fans over the merits of various candidates. Even players elected years ago remain the subjects of discussions as to whether they deserved election. For example, Bill James&#x27; 1994 book &quot;Whatever Happened to the Hall of Fame?&quot; goes into detail about who he believes does and does not belong in the Hall of Fame.

===Non-induction of banned players===

The selection rules for the Baseball Hall of Fame were modified to prevent the induction of anyone on Baseball&#x27;s &quot;permanently ineligible&quot; list. The most prominent former players to be affected are Pete Rose and &quot;Shoeless Joe&quot; Jackson—many others have been barred from participation in MLB, but none have Hall of Fame qualifications on the level of Jackson or Rose. Jackson and Rose were both banned from MLB for life for actions related to gambling on games involving their own teams.

Jackson was determined to have cooperated with those who conspired to intentionally lose the 1919 World Series, and for accepting payment for losing, although his actual level of culpability is fiercely debated. The ensuing Black Sox Scandal led directly to baseball&#x27;s Rule 21, prominently posted in every clubhouse locker room, which mandates permanent banishment from MLB for having a gambling interest of any sort on a game in which a player, manager or umpire is directly involved.

Rose voluntarily accepted a permanent spot on the ineligible list in return for MLB&#x27;s promise to make no official finding in relation to alleged betting on the Cincinnati Reds when he was their manager in the 1980s. No credible evidence has ever emerged to support allegations that Rose bet against his team and/or that his betting influenced his managerial decisions, nevertheless, the betting constituted a clear violation of the aforementioned Rule 21. After years of denial, Rose admitted that he bet on the Reds in his 2004 autobiography.

Baseball fans are deeply split on the issue of whether Rose and/or Jackson (now both deceased) should remain banned or have their punishments posthumously revoked. Writer Bill James, though he advocates Rose eventually making it into the Hall of Fame, compared the people who want to put Jackson in the Hall of Fame to &quot;those women who show up at murder trials wanting to marry the cute murderer&quot;.

===Changes to Veterans Committee process===

The actions and composition of the Veterans Committee have been at times controversial, with occasional selections of contemporaries and teammates of the committee members over seemingly more worthy candidates.

In 2001, the Veterans Committee was reformed to comprise the living Hall of Fame members and other honorees. The revamped Committee held three elections, in 2003 and 2007, for both players and non-players, and in 2005 for players only. No individual was elected in that time, sparking criticism among some observers who expressed doubt whether the new Veterans Committee would ever elect a player. The Committee members, most of whom were Hall members, were accused of being reluctant to elect new candidates in the hope of heightening the value of their own selection. After no one was selected for the third consecutive election in 2007, Hall of Famer Mike Schmidt noted, &quot;The same thing happens every year. The current members want to preserve the prestige as much as possible, and are unwilling to open the doors.&quot; In 2007, the committee and its selection processes were again reorganized; the main committee then included all living members of the Hall, and voted on a reduced number of candidates from among players whose careers began in 1943 or later. Separate committees, including sportswriters and broadcasters, would select umpires, managers and executives, as well as players from earlier eras.

In the first election to be held under the 2007 revisions, two managers and three executives were elected in December 2007 as part of the 2008 election process. The next Veterans Committee elections for players were held in December 2008 as part of the 2009 election process; the main committee did not select a player, while the panel for pre–World War II players elected Joe Gordon in its first and ultimately only vote. The main committee voted as part of the election process for inductions in odd-numbered years, while the pre-World War II panel would vote every five years, and the panel for umpires, managers, and executives voted as part of the election process for inductions in even-numbered years.

Further changes to the Veterans Committee process were announced by the Hall in July 2010, July 2016, and April 2022.

====Current structure====
Per the latest changes, announced on April 22, 2022, the multiple eras previously utilized were collapsed to three, to be voted on in an annual rotation (one per year):
* Contemporary Baseball Era (1980–present) players
* Contemporary Baseball Era (1980–present) non-players (managers, executives, and umpires)
* Classic Baseball Era (prior to 1980)
A one-year waiting period beyond potential BBWAA eligibility (which had been abolished in 2016) was reintroduced, thus restricting the committee to considering players retired for at least 16 seasons.

====Eligibility====
The eligibility criteria for Era Committee consideration differ between players, managers, and executives.
*Players: When a player is no longer eligible on the BBWAA ballot (either 15 years after retirement—five-year period and the 10 years after he first becomes eligible to appear on the BBWAA ballot or when the player is not eligible after earning less than five percent of the BBWAA ballot during a year), he will be considered by the respective committee.
**The Hall has not yet established a policy on when players who die while active or during the standard five-year waiting period for BBWAA eligibility will be eligible for committee consideration. As noted earlier, such players become eligible for the BBWAA ballot six months after their deaths.
*Managers and umpires who have served at least 10 seasons in that role are eligible five years after retirement, unless they are 65 or older, in which case the waiting period is six months.
*Executives are eligible five years after retirement, or upon reaching age 70. For those who meet the age cutoff, they are explicitly eligible for consideration regardless of their current position in an organization or their status as active or retired. Before the 2016 changes to the committee system, active executives 65 years or older were eligible for consideration.

===Players and managers with multiple teams===
While the text on a player&#x27;s or manager&#x27;s plaque lists all teams for which the inductee was a member in that specific role, inductees are usually depicted wearing the cap of a specific team, though in a few cases, like umpires, they wear caps without logos. (Executives are not depicted wearing caps.) Additionally, as of 2015, inductee biographies on the Hall&#x27;s website for all players and managers, and executives who were associated with specific teams, list a &quot;primary team&quot;, which does not necessarily match the cap logo. The Hall selects the logo &quot;based on where that player makes his most indelible mark.&quot;


Although the Hall always made the final decision on which logo was shown, until 2001 the Hall deferred to the wishes of players or managers whose careers were linked with multiple teams. Some examples of inductees associated with multiple teams are the following:
*Frank Robinson: Robinson chose to have the Baltimore Orioles cap displayed on his plaque, although he had played ten seasons with the Cincinnati Reds and six seasons with Baltimore. Robinson won four pennants and two World Series with the Orioles and one pennant with Cincinnati. His second World Series ring came in the 1970 World Series against the Reds. Robinson also won an MVP award while playing for each team.
*Catfish Hunter: Hunter chose not to have any logo on his cap when elected to the Hall of Fame in 1987. Hunter had success for both teams for which he played – the Kansas City/Oakland Athletics (his first ten seasons) and the New York Yankees (his final five seasons). Furthermore, both during and after his career he maintained good relations with both teams and their respective owners (Charles Finley and George Steinbrenner), and did not wish to slight either team by selecting the other.
*Nolan Ryan: Born and raised in Texas, Ryan entered the Hall in 1999 wearing a Texas Rangers cap on his plaque, although he spent only five seasons with the Rangers, while raised in the Houston area and having longer and more successful tenures with the Houston Astros (nine seasons, 1980–88 and his record-setting fifth career no-hitter) and California Angels (eight seasons, 1972–79 and the first four of his seven career no-hitters). Ryan&#x27;s only championship was as a member of the New York Mets in 1969. Ryan finished his career with the Rangers, reaching his 5,000th strikeout and 300th win, and throwing the last two of his no-hitters. He had personally chosen the Rangers due to these figures as well as because Texas encompasses the city of Houston, thereby representing both teams. Despite this, his biography on the Hall&#x27;s website lists his primary team as the Angels. Ryan later took ownership of the Rangers when they were sold to his Rangers Baseball Express group in 2010. He sold his Rangers interest in 2013. From 2014 to 2019, Nolan was in the Astros&#x27; front office as a special assistant. In 2020 Ryan discontinued his executive role with the Astros. The minor-league team in which he has an ownership interest, the Round Rock Express of Round Rock, Texas outside of Austin, will be the AAA franchise of the Texas Rangers.
*Reggie Jackson: Jackson chose to be depicted with a Yankees cap over an Athletics cap. As a member of the Kansas City/Oakland A&#x27;s, Jackson played ten seasons (1967–75, &#x27;87), winning three World Series (1972, 1973, 1974) and the 1973 AL MVP Award. During his five years in New York (1977–81), Jackson won two World Series (1977–78), with his crowning achievement occurring during Game Six of the 1977 World Series, when he hit three home runs on consecutive pitches and earned his nickname &quot;Mr. October&quot;.
*Carlton Fisk: Fisk went into the hall with a Boston Red Sox cap on his plaque in 2000 despite having played with the Chicago White Sox longer and posting more significant numbers with the White Sox. Fisk&#x27;s choice of the Red Sox was likely due to his being a New England native, as well as his famous &quot;Stay fair!&quot; walk-off home run in Game Six of the 1975 World Series for which he is most associated.
*Sparky Anderson: Also in 2000, Anderson entered the Hall with a Cincinnati Reds cap on his plaque despite managing almost twice as many seasons with the Detroit Tigers (17 in Detroit; nine in Cincinnati). He chose the Reds to honor that team&#x27;s former general manager Bob Howsam, who gave him his first major-league managing job. Anderson won two World Series with the Reds and one with the Tigers.
*Dave Winfield: Winfield had spent the most years in his career with the Yankees and had great success there, though he chose to go into the Hall as a member of the San Diego Padres due to his feud with Yankees owner George Steinbrenner.

In all of the above cases, the &quot;primary team&quot; is the team for which the inductee spent the largest portion of his career except for Ryan, whose primary team is listed as the Angels despite playing one fewer season for that team than for the Astros.

In 2001, the Hall of Fame decided to change the policy on cap logo selection, as a result of rumors that some teams were offering compensation, such as number retirement, money, or organizational jobs, in exchange for the cap designation. (For example, though Wade Boggs denied the claims, some media reports had said that his contract with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays required him to request depiction in the Hall of Fame as a Devil Ray.) The Hall decided that it would no longer defer to the inductee, though the player&#x27;s wishes would be considered, when deciding on the logo to appear on the plaque. Newly elected members affected by the change include the following:
*Gary Carter: Inducted in 2003, Carter was the first player to be affected by the new policy. Carter won his only championship with the 1986 New York Mets, and wanted his induction plaque to depict him wearing a Mets cap, though he had spent twelve years (1974–84, 1992) with the Montreal Expos and five (1985–89) with the Mets. The Hall of Fame decided that Carter&#x27;s impact on the Montreal franchise warranted depicting him with an Expos cap.
*Wade Boggs: Boggs&#x27;s only title was as a member of the 1996 New York Yankees, for whom he played from 1993 to 1997, but his best career numbers were posted during his 11 years (1982–92) with the Boston Red Sox. Boggs would eventually be depicted wearing a Boston cap for his 2005 induction.
*Andre Dawson: Dawson&#x27;s cap depicts him as a member of the Expos, his team for eleven years, despite his expressed preference to be shown as a member of the Chicago Cubs. While Dawson played only six years with the Cubs, five of his eight All-Star appearances were as a Cub, and his only MVP award came in his first year with the team in 1987.
*Tony La Russa: Manager La Russa chose not to have a logo after managing three teams over 33 years—the Chicago White Sox, Oakland Athletics, and St. Louis Cardinals. His greatest successes were with the A&#x27;s (three pennants and a World Series title in 10 years) and Cardinals (three pennants and two World Series in 16 years). Nonetheless, La Russa felt that his induction to the Hall was due to his tenures with all three teams, and stated that not including a logo meant that &quot;fans of all [three] clubs can celebrate this honor with me.&quot; La Russa&#x27;s biography on the Hall&#x27;s website lists his primary team as the Cardinals.
*Greg Maddux: Although Maddux had his greatest success while with the Atlanta Braves for 11 seasons, he had two stints with the Chicago Cubs for a total of 10 seasons, including the first seven of his MLB career. Maddux believed that both fanbases were equally important in his career, and so the cap on his plaque does not feature any logo. His biography on the Hall&#x27;s website lists his primary team as the Braves.
*Randy Johnson: Johnson played for six teams in a 22-year career, but spent the bulk of it with the Seattle Mariners (10 seasons) and Arizona Diamondbacks (8 seasons). While enjoying great success with both teams, he had more significant honors with the Diamondbacks. Four of Johnson&#x27;s five Cy Young Awards (consecutively from 1999 to 2002), his only title (in 2001), his pitching triple crown (2002), and his perfect game (2004) all came with Arizona. Accordingly, he and the Hall agreed his plaque should feature a Diamondbacks logo. His biography on the Hall&#x27;s website lists his primary team as the Mariners.
*Vladimir Guerrero: Guerrero played the majority of his career with the Montreal Expos, spending eight of his sixteen seasons with the team. However, he recorded the majority of his success during his time with the Angels, including five out of his nine All-Star selections, his MVP award, four out of his eight Silver Slugger awards, and all five of his playoff berths. Guerrero ultimately had an Angels logo on his plaque, becoming the only member of the team to have as such. His biography on the Hall&#x27;s website lists his primary team as the Expos.
*Mike Mussina, who played 10 seasons with the Baltimore Orioles and eight seasons with the New York Yankees, decided to go into the Hall without a logo on his plaque, saying &quot;I don&#x27;t feel like I can pick one team over the other because they were both great to me. I did a lot in Baltimore and they gave me the chance and then in New York we went to the playoffs seven of eight years, and both teams were involved. To go in with no logo was the only decision I felt good about&quot;. Mussina&#x27;s biography at the Hall lists his primary team as the Orioles.
*Roy Halladay was posthumously elected to the Hall on January 22, 2019, in his first year of eligibility, garnering 85.4 percent of the vote. Halladay was a six-time All-Star and won a Cy Young award with the Toronto Blue Jays from 1998 to 2009, and then was a two-time All-Star and won a Cy Young award with the Philadelphia Phillies over his final four seasons. He spent 12 of his 16 MLB seasons with the Blue Jays and earned 148 of his 203 victories with them, although his team never reached the playoffs. For the Phillies, he threw a perfect game and a postseason no-hitter, though his final two seasons were injury-plagued. Halladay was quoted as saying after he retired in 2013 that he&#x27;d like to enter the Hall of Fame as a Blue Jay, and he signed a ceremonial contract to retire with Toronto. However, he died in a plane crash on November 7, 2017. The Hall deferred to the wishes of his wife and sons who chose not to have a logo for his cap, which leaves Roberto Alomar as the sole Cooperstown inductee as a Blue Jay. Halladay&#x27;s biography on the Hall&#x27;s website lists his primary team as the Blue Jays.

==The museum==
Sam Crane (who had played a decade in 19th century baseball before becoming a manager and sportswriter) had first approached the idea of making a memorial to the great players of the past in what was believed to have been the birthplace of baseball: Cooperstown, New York, but the idea did not muster much momentum until after his death in 1925. In 1934, the idea for establishing a Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum was devised by several individuals, such as Ford C. Frick (president of the National League) and Alexander Cleland, a Scottish immigrant who decided to serve as the first executive secretary for the Museum for the next seven years that worked with the interests of the Village and Major League Baseball. Stephen Carlton Clark (a Cooperstown native) paid for the construction of the museum, which was planned to open in 1939 to mark the &quot;Centennial of Baseball&quot;, which included renovations to Doubleday Field. William Beattie served as the first curator of the museum.

According to the Hall of Fame, approximately 260,000 visitors enter the museum each year, and the running total has surpassed 17 million. These visitors see only a fraction of its 40,000 artifacts, 3 million library items (such as newspaper clippings and photos) and 140,000 baseball cards.

The Hall has seen a noticeable decrease in attendance since the mid-2010s. A 2013 story on ESPN.com about the village of Cooperstown and its relation to the game partially linked the reduced attendance with Cooperstown Dreams Park, a youth baseball complex about away in the town of Hartwick. The 22 fields at Dreams Park currently draw 17,000 players each summer for a week of intensive play; while the complex includes housing for the players, their parents and grandparents must stay elsewhere. According to the story,

Prior to Dreams Park, a room might be filled for a week by several sets of tourists. Now, that room will be taken by just one family for the week, and that family may only go into Cooperstown and the Hall of Fame once. While there are other contributing factors (the recession and high gas prices among them), the Hall&#x27;s attendance has tumbled since Dreams Park opened. The Hall drew 383,000 visitors in 1999. It drew 262,000 last year.

===Second floor===
*The Grandstand Theater features a 12-minute multimedia film. The 200-seat theater, complete with replica stadium seats, is decorated to resemble old Comiskey Park.
*The Game is the major feature of the second floor. It is where the most artifacts are displayed. The Game is set up in a timeline format, starting with baseball&#x27;s beginnings and culminating with the game we know today. There are several offshoots of this meandering timeline:
**Taking The Field (19th century baseball)
**Babe Ruth: His Life and Legend
**The Souls of the Game: Voices of Black Baseball (the Museum&#x27;s newest permanent exhibit documenting pre-Negro leagues history through the present day)
**Diamond Dreams (women in baseball)
**¡Viva Baseball! (a bilingual exhibit, in English and Spanish, that celebrates baseball in Latin America)

*Whole New Ballgame opened in 2015 and is located in the Janetschek Gallery. This exhibit completes the timeline of baseball through the last 45 years into the game we know today. It features environmental video walls and new interactive elements to go along with artifacts from the Museum&#x27;s collection.
*The Today&#x27;s Game exhibit holds objects donated to the Hall of Fame from the past year or two.

**An inductee database touch-screen computer with statistics for every inductee.
**Programs from every World Series.
*Sacred Ground is devoted entirely to ballparks and everything about them, especially the fan experience and the business of a ballpark. The centerpiece is a computer tour of three former ballparks: Boston&#x27;s South End Grounds, Chicago&#x27;s Comiskey Park, and Brooklyn&#x27;s Ebbets Field.
*The Your Team Today exhibit is built like a baseball clubhouse, with 30 glass-enclosed locker stalls, one for each Major League franchise. In each stall there is a jersey and other items from the designated big league team, along with a brief team history.

==Notable events==
===1982 unauthorized sales===
A controversy erupted in 1982, when it emerged that some historic items given to the Hall had been sold on the collectibles market. The items had been lent to the Baseball Commissioner&#x27;s office, gotten mixed up with other property owned by the Commissioner&#x27;s office and employees of the office, and moved to the garage of Joe Reichler, an assistant to Commissioner Bowie Kuhn, who sold the items to resolve his personal financial difficulties. Under pressure from the New York Attorney General, the Commissioner&#x27;s Office made reparations, but the negative publicity damaged the Hall of Fame&#x27;s reputation, and made it more difficult for it to solicit donations.

===2014 commemorative coins===
In 2012, Congress passed and President Barack Obama signed a law ordering the United States Mint to produce and sell commemorative, non-circulating coins to benefit the private, non-profit Hall. The bill, , was introduced in the United States House of Representatives by Rep. Richard Hanna, a Republican from New York, and passed the House on October 26, 2011. The coins, which depict baseball gloves and balls, are the first concave designs produced by the Mint. The mintage included 50,000 gold coins, 400,000 silver coins, and 750,000 clad (nickel-copper) coins. The Mint released them on March 27, 2014, and the gold and silver editions quickly sold out. The Hall receives money from surcharges included in the sale price: a total of $9.5 million if all the coins are sold.

<text>In computational complexity theory, a branch of computer science, bounded-error probabilistic polynomial time (BPP) is the class of decision problems solvable by a probabilistic Turing machine in polynomial time with an error probability bounded by 1/3 for all instances.
BPP is one of the largest &quot;practical&quot; classes of problems, meaning most problems of interest in BPP have efficient probabilistic algorithms that can be run quickly on real modern machines. BPP also contains [[P (complexity)|P]], the class of problems solvable in polynomial time with a deterministic machine, since a deterministic machine is a special case of a probabilistic machine.

Informally, a problem is in BPP if there is an algorithm for it that has the following properties:
*It is allowed to flip coins and make random decisions
*It is guaranteed to run in polynomial time
*On any given run of the algorithm, it has a probability of at most 1/3 of giving the wrong answer, whether the answer is YES or NO.

== Definition ==
A language &quot;L&quot; is in BPP if and only if there exists a probabilistic Turing machine &quot;M&quot;, such that
* &quot;M&quot; runs for polynomial time on all inputs
* For all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;L&quot;, &quot;M&quot; outputs 1 with probability greater than or equal to 2/3
* For all &quot;x&quot; not in &quot;L&quot;, &quot;M&quot; outputs 1 with probability less than or equal to 1/3
Unlike the complexity class ZPP, the machine &quot;M&quot; is required to run for polynomial time on all inputs, regardless of the outcome of the random coin flips.

Alternatively, BPP can be defined using only deterministic Turing machines. A language &quot;L&quot; is in BPP if and only if there exists a polynomial &quot;p&quot; and deterministic Turing machine &quot;M&quot;, such that
* &quot;M&quot; runs for polynomial time on all inputs
* For all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;L&quot;, the fraction of strings &quot;y&quot; of length &quot;p&quot;(|&quot;x&quot;|) which satisfy is greater than or equal to 2/3
* For all &quot;x&quot; not in &quot;L&quot;, the fraction of strings &quot;y&quot; of length &quot;p&quot;(|&quot;x&quot;|) which satisfy is less than or equal to 1/3
In this definition, the string &quot;y&quot; corresponds to the output of the random coin flips that the probabilistic Turing machine would have made. For some applications this definition is preferable since it does not mention probabilistic Turing machines.

In practice, an error probability of 1/3 might not be acceptable; however, the choice of 1/3 in the definition is arbitrary. Modifying the definition to use any constant between 0 and 1/2 (exclusive) in place of 1/3 would not change the resulting set BPP. For example, if one defined the class with the restriction that the algorithm can be wrong with probability at most 1/2100, this would result in the same class of problems. The error probability does not even have to be constant: the same class of problems is defined by allowing error as high as 1/2 − &quot;n&quot;−&quot;c&quot; on the one hand, or requiring error as small as 2−&quot;nc&quot; on the other hand, where &quot;c&quot; is any positive constant, and &quot;n&quot; is the length of input. This flexibility in the choice of error probability is based on the idea of running an error-prone algorithm many times, and using the majority result of the runs to obtain a more accurate algorithm. The chance that the majority of the runs are wrong drops off exponentially as a consequence of the Chernoff bound.

== Problems ==

All problems in P are obviously also in BPP. However, many problems have been known to be in BPP but not known to be in P. The number of such problems is decreasing, and it is conjectured that P = BPP.

For a long time, one of the most famous problems known to be in BPP but not known to be in P was the problem of determining whether a given number is prime. However, in the 2002 paper &quot;PRIMES is in P&quot;, Manindra Agrawal and his students Neeraj Kayal and Nitin Saxena found a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for this problem, thus showing that it is in P.

An important example of a problem in BPP (in fact in co-RP) still not known to be in P is polynomial identity testing, the problem of determining whether a polynomial is identically equal to the zero polynomial, when you have access to the value of the polynomial for any given input, but not to the coefficients. In other words, is there an assignment of values to the variables such that when a nonzero polynomial is evaluated on these values, the result is nonzero? It suffices to choose each variable&#x27;s value uniformly at random from a finite subset of at least &quot;d&quot; values to achieve bounded error probability, where &quot;d&quot; is the total degree of the polynomial.

== Related classes ==
If the access to randomness is removed from the definition of BPP, we get the complexity class P. In the definition of the class, if we replace the ordinary Turing machine with a quantum computer, we get the class BQP.

Adding postselection to BPP, or allowing computation paths to have different lengths, gives the class BPPpath. BPPpath is known to contain NP, and it is contained in its quantum counterpart PostBQP.

A Monte Carlo algorithm is a randomized algorithm which is likely to be correct. Problems in the class BPP have Monte Carlo algorithms with polynomial bounded running time. This is compared to a Las Vegas algorithm which is a randomized algorithm which either outputs the correct answer, or outputs &quot;fail&quot; with low probability. Las Vegas algorithms with polynomial bound running times are used to define the class ZPP. Alternatively, ZPP contains probabilistic algorithms that are always correct and have expected polynomial running time. This is weaker than saying it is a polynomial time algorithm, since it may run for super-polynomial time, but with very low probability.

== Complexity-theoretic properties ==

It is known that BPP is closed under complement; that is, BPP = co-BPP. BPP is low for itself, meaning that a BPP machine with the power to solve BPP problems instantly (a BPP oracle machine) is not any more powerful than the machine without this extra power. In symbols, BPPBPP = BPP.

The relationship between BPP and NP is unknown: it is not known whether BPP is a subset of NP, NP is a subset of BPP or neither. If NP is contained in BPP, which is considered unlikely since it would imply practical solutions for NP-complete problems, then NP = RP and PH ⊆ BPP.

It is known that RP is a subset of BPP, and BPP is a subset of PP. It is not known whether those two are strict subsets, since we don&#x27;t even know if P is a strict subset of PSPACE. BPP is contained in the second level of the polynomial hierarchy and therefore it is contained in PH. More precisely, the Sipser–Lautemann theorem states that formula_1. As a result, P = NP leads to P = BPP since PH collapses to P in this case. Thus either P = BPP or P ≠ NP or both.

Adleman&#x27;s theorem states that membership in any language in BPP can be determined by a family of polynomial-size Boolean circuits, which means BPP is contained in P/poly. Indeed, as a consequence of the proof of this fact, every BPP algorithm operating on inputs of bounded length can be derandomized into a deterministic algorithm using a fixed string of random bits. Finding this string may be expensive, however. Some weak separation results for Monte Carlo time classes were proven by , see also .

=== Closure properties ===
The class BPP is closed under complementation, union and intersection.

=== Relativization ===
Relative to oracles, we know that there exist oracles A and B, such that PA = BPPA and PB ≠ BPPB. Moreover, relative to a random oracle with probability 1, P = BPP and BPP is strictly contained in NP and co-NP.

There is even an oracle in which (and hence ), which can be iteratively constructed as follows. For a fixed ENP (relativized) complete problem, the oracle will give correct answers with high probability if queried with the problem instance followed by a random string of length &quot;kn&quot; (&quot;n&quot; is instance length; &quot;k&quot; is an appropriate small constant). Start with &quot;n&quot;=1. For every instance of the problem of length &quot;n&quot; fix oracle answers (see lemma below) to fix the instance output. Next, provide the instance outputs for queries consisting of the instance followed by &quot;kn&quot;-length string, and then treat output for queries of length ≤(&quot;k&quot;+1)&quot;n&quot; as fixed, and proceed with instances of length &quot;n&quot;+1.


The lemma ensures that (for a large enough &quot;k&quot;), it is possible to do the construction while leaving enough strings for the relativized answers. Also, we can ensure that for the relativized , linear time suffices, even for function problems (if given a function oracle and linear output size) and with exponentially small (with linear exponent) error probability. Also, this construction is effective in that given an arbitrary oracle A we can arrange the oracle B to have and . Also, for a oracle (and hence ), one would fix the answers in the relativized E computation to a special nonanswer, thus ensuring that no fake answers are given.

== Derandomization ==
The existence of certain strong pseudorandom number generators is conjectured by most experts of the field. Such generators could replace true random numbers in any polynomial-time randomized algorithm, producing indistinguishable results. The conjecture that these generators exist implies that randomness does not give additional computational power to polynomial time computation, that is, P = RP = BPP. More strongly, the assumption that P = BPP is in some sense equivalent to the existence of strong pseudorandom number generators.

László Babai, Lance Fortnow, Noam Nisan, and Avi Wigderson showed that unless EXPTIME collapses to MA, BPP is contained in 
:formula_2 
The class i.o.-SUBEXP, which stands for infinitely often SUBEXP, contains problems which have sub-exponential time algorithms for infinitely many input sizes. They also showed that P = BPP if the exponential-time hierarchy, which is defined in terms of the polynomial hierarchy and E as EPH, collapses to E; however, note that the exponential-time hierarchy is usually conjectured &quot;not&quot; to collapse.

Russell Impagliazzo and Avi Wigderson showed that if any problem in E, where 
:formula_3 
has circuit complexity 2Ω(&quot;n&quot;) then P = BPP.

<text>In computational complexity theory, bounded-error quantum polynomial time (BQP) is the class of decision problems solvable by a quantum computer in polynomial time, with an error probability of at most 1/3 for all instances. It is the quantum analogue to the complexity class [[BPP (complexity)|BPP]].

A decision problem is a member of BQP if there exists a quantum algorithm (an algorithm that runs on a quantum computer) that solves the decision problem with high probability and is guaranteed to run in polynomial time. A run of the algorithm will correctly solve the decision problem with a probability of at least 2/3.

==Definition==
BQP can be viewed as the languages associated with certain bounded-error uniform families of quantum circuits. A language &quot;L&quot; is in BQP if and only if there exists a polynomial-time uniform family of quantum circuits formula_1, such that
* For all formula_2, &quot;Qn&quot; takes &quot;n&quot; qubits as input and outputs 1 bit
* For all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;L&quot;, formula_3
* For all &quot;x&quot; not in &quot;L&quot;, formula_4

Alternatively, one can define BQP in terms of quantum Turing machines. A language &quot;L&quot; is in BQP if and only if there exists a polynomial quantum Turing machine that accepts &quot;L&quot; with an error probability of at most 1/3 for all instances.

Similarly to other &quot;bounded error&quot; probabilistic classes, the choice of 1/3 in the definition is arbitrary. We can run the algorithm a constant number of times and take a majority vote to achieve any desired probability of correctness less than 1, using the Chernoff bound. The complexity class is unchanged by allowing error as high as 1/2 − &quot;n&quot;−&quot;c&quot; on the one hand, or requiring error as small as 2−&quot;nc&quot; on the other hand, where &quot;c&quot; is any positive constant, and &quot;n&quot; is the length of input.

== Relationship to other complexity classes ==


BQP is defined for quantum computers; the corresponding complexity class for classical computers (or more formally for probabilistic Turing machines) is BPP. Just like P and BPP, BQP is low for itself, which means . Informally, this is true because polynomial time algorithms are closed under composition. If a polynomial time algorithm calls polynomial time algorithms as subroutines, the resulting algorithm is still polynomial time.

BQP contains P and BPP and is contained in AWPP, PP and PSPACE.
In fact, BQP is low for PP, meaning that a PP machine achieves no benefit from being able to solve BQP problems instantly, an indication of the possible difference in power between these similar classes. The known relationships with classic complexity classes are:
:formula_5

As the problem of has not yet been solved, the proof of inequality between BQP and classes mentioned above is supposed to be difficult. The relation between BQP and NP is not known. In May 2018, computer scientists Ran Raz of Princeton University and Avishay Tal of Stanford University published a paper which showed that, relative to an oracle, BQP was not contained in PH. It can be proven that there exists an oracle A such that formula_6. In an extremely informal sense, this can be thought of as giving PH and BQP an identical, but additional, capability and verifying that BQP with the oracle (BQPA) can do things PHA cannot. While an oracle separation has been proven, the fact that BQP is not contained in PH has not been proven. An oracle separation does not prove whether or not complexity classes are the same. The oracle separation gives intuition that BQP may not be contained in PH.

It has been suspected for many years that Fourier Sampling is a problem that exists within BQP, but not within the polynomial hierarchy. Recent conjectures have provided evidence that a similar problem, Fourier Checking, also exists in the class BQP without being contained in the polynomial hierarchy. This conjecture is especially notable because it suggests that problems existing in BQP could be classified as harder than NP-Complete problems. Paired with the fact that many practical BQP problems are suspected to exist outside of P (it is suspected and not verified because there is no proof that P ≠ NP), this illustrates the potential power of quantum computing in relation to classical computing.

Adding postselection to BQP results in the complexity class PostBQP which is equal to PP.

=== A complete problem for Promise-BQP ===

Promise-BQP is the class of promise problems that can be solved by a uniform family of quantum circuits (i.e., within BQP). Completeness proofs focus on this version of BQP. Similar to the notion of NP-completeness and other complete problems, we can define a complete problem as a problem that is in Promise-BQP and that every other problem in Promise-BQP reduces to it in polynomial time. 

==== APPROX-QCIRCUIT-PROB ====

The APPROX-QCIRCUIT-PROB problem is complete for efficient quantum computation, and the version presented below is complete for the Promise-BQP complexity class (and not for the total BQP complexity class, for which no complete problems are known). APPROX-QCIRCUIT-PROB&#x27;s completeness makes it useful for proofs showing the relationships between other complexity classes and BQP.

Given a description of a quantum circuit acting on qubits with gates, where is a polynomial in and each gate acts on one or two qubits, and two numbers formula_7, distinguish between the following two cases:
* measuring the first qubit of the state formula_8 yields formula_9 with probability formula_10
* measuring the first qubit of the state formula_8 yields formula_9 with probability formula_13

Here, there is a promise on the inputs as the problem does not specify the behavior if an instance is not covered by these two cases.

Claim. Any BQP problem reduces to APPROX-QCIRCUIT-PROB. 

Proof. 
Suppose we have an algorithm that solves APPROX-QCIRCUIT-PROB, i.e., given a quantum circuit acting on qubits, and two numbers formula_7, distinguishes between the above two cases. We can solve any problem in BQP with this oracle, by setting formula_15.

For any formula_16, there exists family of quantum circuits formula_1 such that for all formula_2, a state formula_19 of formula_20 qubits, if formula_21; else if formula_22. Fix an input formula_19 of qubits, and the corresponding quantum circuit formula_24. We can first construct a circuit formula_25 such that formula_26. This can be done easily by hardwiring formula_19 and apply a sequence of CNOT gates to flip the qubits. Then we can combine two circuits to get formula_28, and now formula_29. And finally, necessarily the results of formula_24 is obtained by measuring several qubits and apply some (classical) logic gates to them. We can always defer the measurement and reroute the circuits so that by measuring the first qubit of formula_29, we get the output. This will be our circuit , and we decide the membership of formula_32 by running formula_33 with formula_15. By definition of BQP, we will either fall into the first case (acceptance), or the second case (rejection), so formula_16 reduces to APPROX-QCIRCUIT-PROB.

=== BQP and EXP ===

We begin with an easier containment. To show that formula_36, it suffices to show that APPROX-QCIRCUIT-PROB is in EXP since APPROX-QCIRCUIT-PROB is BQP-complete.

Note that this algorithm also requires formula_37 space to store the vectors and the matrices. We will show in the following section that we can improve upon the space complexity.

=== BQP and PSPACE ===

Sum of histories is a technique introduced by physicist Richard Feynman for path integral formulation. APPROX-QCIRCUIT-PROB can be formulated in the sum of histories technique to show that formula_38.

Consider a quantum circuit , which consists of gates, formula_39, where each formula_40 comes from a universal gate set and acts on at most two qubits.
To understand what the sum of histories is, we visualize the evolution of a quantum state given a quantum circuit as a tree. The root is the input formula_41, and each node in the tree has formula_42 children, each representing a state in formula_43. The weight on a tree edge from a node in -th level representing a state formula_44 to a node in formula_45-th level representing a state formula_46 is formula_47, the amplitude of formula_46 after applying formula_49 on formula_44. The transition amplitude of a root-to-leaf path is the product of all the weights on the edges along the path. To get the probability of the final state being formula_51, we sum up the amplitudes of all root-to-leave paths that ends at a node representing formula_51.

More formally, for the quantum circuit , its sum over histories tree is a tree of depth , with one level for each gate formula_53 in addition to the root, and with branching factor formula_42.





Notice in the sum over histories algorithm to compute some amplitude formula_55, only one history is stored at any point in the computation. Hence, the sum over histories algorithm uses formula_56 space to compute formula_55 for any since formula_56 bits are needed to store the histories in addition to some workspace variables.

Therefore, in polynomial space, we may compute formula_59 over all with the first qubit being , which is the probability that the first qubit is measured to be 1 by the end of the circuit.

Notice that compared with the simulation given for the proof that formula_36, our algorithm here takes far less space but far more time instead. In fact it takes formula_61 time to calculate a single amplitude!

=== BQP and PP ===

A similar sum-over-histories argument can be used to show that formula_62. 

=== P and BQP ===

We know formula_63, since every classical circuit can be simulated by a quantum circuit. 

It is conjectured that BQP solves hard problems outside of P, specifically, problems in NP. The claim is indefinite because we don&#x27;t know if P=NP, so we don&#x27;t know if those problems are actually in P. Below are some evidence of the conjecture:

*Integer factorization (see Shor&#x27;s algorithm)
*Discrete logarithm
*Simulation of quantum systems (see universal quantum simulator)
*Approximating the Jones polynomial at certain roots of unity
*Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm

<doc id="4086" wikidata="Q244627" url="?curid=4086" title="Brainfuck">
<text>Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Swiss student Urban Müller. Designed to be extremely minimalistic, the language consists of only eight simple commands, a data pointer, and an instruction pointer.

Brainfuck is an example of a so-called Turing tarpit: it can be used to write any program, but it is not practical to do so because it provides so little abstraction that the programs get very long or complicated. While Brainfuck is fully Turing-complete, it is not intended for practical use but to challenge and amuse programmers. Brainfuck requires one to break down commands into small and simple instructions.

The language takes its name from the slang term &quot;brainfuck&quot;, which refers to things so complicated or unusual that they exceed the limits of one&#x27;s understanding, as it was not meant or made for designing actual software but to challenge the boundaries of computer programming.

Because the language&#x27;s name contains profanity, many substitutes are used, such as brainfsck, branflakes, brainoof, brainfrick, BrainF, and BF.

== History ==
Müller designed Brainfuck with the goal of implementing the smallest possible compiler, inspired by the 1024-byte compiler for the FALSE programming language. Müller&#x27;s original compiler was implemented in Motorola 68000 assembly on the Amiga and compiled to a binary with a size of 296 bytes. He uploaded the first Brainfuck compiler to Aminet in 1993. The program came with a &quot;Readme&quot; file, which briefly described the language, and challenged the reader &quot;Who can program anything useful with it? :)&quot;. Müller also included an interpreter and some examples. A second version of the compiler used only 240 bytes.

== Language design ==
The language consists of eight commands. A brainfuck program is a sequence of these commands, possibly interspersed with other characters (which are ignored). The commands are executed sequentially, with some exceptions: an instruction pointer begins at the first command, and each command it points to is executed, after which it normally moves forward to the next command. The program terminates when the instruction pointer moves past the last command.

The brainfuck language uses a simple machine model consisting of the program and instruction pointer, as well as a one-dimensional array of at least 30,000 byte cells initialized to zero; a movable data pointer (initialized to point to the leftmost byte of the array); and two streams of bytes for input and output (most often connected to a keyboard and a monitor respectively, and using the ASCII character encoding).

The eight language commands each consist of a single character:

codice_1 and codice_2 match as parentheses usually do: each codice_1 matches exactly one codice_2 and vice versa, the codice_1 comes first, and there can be no unmatched codice_1 or codice_2 between the two.

Brainfuck programs are usually difficult to comprehend. This is partly because any mildly complex task requires a long sequence of commands and partly because the program&#x27;s text gives no direct indications of the program&#x27;s state. These, as well as Brainfuck&#x27;s inefficiency and its limited input/output capabilities, are some of the reasons it is not used for serious programming. Nonetheless, like any Turing-complete language, Brainfuck is theoretically capable of computing any computable function or simulating any other computational model if given access to an unlimited amount of memory and time. A variety of Brainfuck programs have been written. Although Brainfuck programs, especially complicated ones, are difficult to write, it is quite trivial to write an interpreter for Brainfuck in a more typical language such as C due to its simplicity. Brainfuck interpreters written in the Brainfuck language itself also exist.

== Examples ==
=== Adding two values ===
As a first, simple example, the following code snippet will add the current cell&#x27;s value to the next cell: Each time the loop is executed, the current cell is decremented, the data pointer moves to the right, that next cell is incremented, and the data pointer moves left again. This sequence is repeated until the starting cell is 0.
[-&gt;+&lt;]
This can be incorporated into a simple addition program as follows:
++ Cell c0 = 2
&gt; +++++ Cell c1 = 5

[ Start your loops with your cell pointer on the loop counter (c1 in our case)
&lt; + Add 1 to c0
&gt; - Subtract 1 from c1
] End your loops with the cell pointer on the loop counter

At this point our program has added 5 to 2 leaving 7 in c0 and 0 in c1
but we cannot output this value to the terminal since it is not ASCII encoded

To display the ASCII character &quot;7&quot; we must add 48 to the value 7
We use a loop to compute 48 = 6 * 8

++++ ++++ c1 = 8 and this will be our loop counter again
&lt; +++ +++ Add 6 to c0
&gt; - Subtract 1 from c1
&lt; . Print out c0 which has the value 55 which translates to &quot;7&quot;!
=== Hello World! ===
The following program prints &quot;Hello World!&quot; and a newline to the screen:
[ This program prints &quot;Hello World!&quot; and a newline to the screen; its
 length is 106 active command characters. [It is not the shortest.]

 This loop is an &quot;initial comment loop&quot;, a simple way of adding a comment
 to a BF program such that you don&#x27;t have to worry about any command
 characters. Any &quot;.&quot;, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;+&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot; characters are simply
 ignored, the &quot;[&quot; and &quot;]&quot; characters just have to be balanced. This
 loop and the commands it contains are ignored because the current cell
 defaults to a value of 0; the 0 value causes this loop to be skipped.
++++++++ Set Cell #0 to 8
 &gt;++++ Add 4 to Cell #1; this will always set Cell #1 to 4
 [ as the cell will be cleared by the loop
 &gt;++ Add 2 to Cell #2
 &gt;+++ Add 3 to Cell #3
 &gt;+++ Add 3 to Cell #4
 &gt;+ Add 1 to Cell #5
 ««- Decrement the loop counter in Cell #1
 ] Loop until Cell #1 is zero; number of iterations is 4
 &gt;+ Add 1 to Cell #2
 &gt;+ Add 1 to Cell #3
 &gt;- Subtract 1 from Cell #4
 »+ Add 1 to Cell #6
 [&lt;] Move back to the first zero cell you find; this will
 be Cell #1 which was cleared by the previous loop
 &lt;- Decrement the loop Counter in Cell #0
] Loop until Cell #0 is zero; number of iterations is 8

The result of this is:
Cell no : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
Contents: 0 0 72 104 88 32 8
Pointer : ^

». Cell #2 has value 72 which is &#x27;H&#x27;
&gt;---. Subtract 3 from Cell #3 to get 101 which is &#x27;e&#x27;
+++++++..+++. Likewise for &#x27;llo&#x27; from Cell #3
». Cell #5 is 32 for the space
&lt;-. Subtract 1 from Cell #4 for 87 to give a &#x27;W&#x27;
&lt;. Cell #3 was set to &#x27;o&#x27; from the end of &#x27;Hello&#x27;
+++.------.--------. Cell #3 for &#x27;rl&#x27; and &#x27;d&#x27;
»+. Add 1 to Cell #5 gives us an exclamation point
&gt;++. And finally a newline from Cell #6
For readability, this code has been spread across many lines, and blanks and comments have been added. Brainfuck ignores all characters except the eight commands codice_8 so no special syntax for comments is needed (as long as the comments do not contain the command characters). The code could just as well have been written as:

=== ROT13 ===
This program enciphers its input with the ROT13 cipher. To do this, it must map characters A-M (ASCII 65–77) to N-Z (78–90), and vice versa. Also it must map a-m (97–109) to n-z (110–122) and vice versa. It must map all other characters to themselves; it reads characters one at a time and outputs their enciphered equivalents until it reads an EOF (here assumed to be represented as either -1 or &quot;no change&quot;), at which point the program terminates.
-,+[ Read first character and start outer character reading loop
 -[ Skip forward if character is 0
 »++++[&gt;++++++++&lt;-] Set up divisor (32) for division loop
 (MEMORY LAYOUT: dividend copy remainder divisor quotient zero zero)
 &lt;+&lt;-[ Set up dividend (x minus 1) and enter division loop
 &gt;+&gt;+&gt;-[»&gt;] Increase copy and remainder / reduce divisor / Normal case: skip forward
 &lt;&gt;+&lt;-]»+&gt;] Special case: move remainder back to divisor and increase quotient
 ««&lt;- Decrement dividend
 ] End division loop
 ]»&gt;[-]+ End skip loop; zero former divisor and reuse space for a flag
 &gt;--[-[&lt;-&gt;+++[-]&lt;[ Zero that flag unless quotient was 2 or 3; zero quotient; check flag
 ++++++++++++&lt;[ If flag then set up divisor (13) for second division loop
 (MEMORY LAYOUT: zero copy dividend divisor remainder quotient zero zero)
 &gt;-[&gt;+»] Reduce divisor; Normal case: increase remainder
 &gt;[+[&lt;+&gt;-]&gt;+»] Special case: increase remainder / move it back to divisor / increase quotient
 ««&lt;- Decrease dividend
 ] End division loop
 »[&lt;+&gt;-] Add remainder back to divisor to get a useful 13
 &gt;[ Skip forward if quotient was 0
 -[ Decrement quotient and skip forward if quotient was 1
 -«[-]» Zero quotient and divisor if quotient was 2
 ]«[«-»-]» Zero divisor and subtract 13 from copy if quotient was 1
 ]«[«+»-] Zero divisor and add 13 to copy if quotient was 0
 ] End outer skip loop (jump to here if ((character minus 1)/32) was not 2 or 3)
 &lt;[-] Clear remainder from first division if second division was skipped
 &lt;.[-] Output ROT13ed character from copy and clear it
 &lt;-,+ Read next character
] End character reading loop
=== Simulation of abiogenesis ===
In 2024, a Google research project used a slightly modified 7-command version of Brainfuck as the basis of an artificial digital environment. In this environment, they found that replicators arose naturally and competed with each other for domination of the environment.

<doc id="4091" wikidata="Q312366" url="?curid=4091" title="Bartolomeo Ammannati">
<text>Bartolomeo Ammannati (18 June 1511 – 13 April 1592) was an Italian architect and sculptor, born at Settignano, near Florence, Italy. He studied under Baccio Bandinelli and Jacopo Sansovino (assisting on the design of the Library of St. Mark&#x27;s, the Biblioteca Marciana, Venice) and closely imitated the style of Michelangelo.

He was more distinguished in architecture than in sculpture. He worked in Rome in collaboration with Vignola and Vasari), including designs for the Villa Giulia, but also for works at Lucca. He labored during 1558–1570, in the refurbishment and enlargement of Pitti Palace, creating the courtyard consisting of three wings with rusticated facades, and one lower portico leading to the amphitheatre in the Boboli Gardens. His design mirrored the appearance of the main external façade of Pitti. He was also named &quot;Consul&quot; of Accademia delle Arti del Disegno of Florence, which had been founded by the Duke Cosimo I in 1563.
In 1569, Ammannati was commissioned to build the Ponte Santa Trinita, a bridge over the Arno River. The three arches are elliptic, and though very light and elegant, has survived, when floods had damaged other Arno bridges at different times. Santa Trinita was destroyed in 1944, during World War II, and rebuilt in 1957.

Ammannati designed what is considered a prototypic Mannerist sculptural ensemble in the Fountain of Neptune (&quot;Fontana del Nettuno&quot;), prominently located in the Piazza della Signoria in the center of Florence. The assignment was originally given to the aged Bartolommeo Bandinelli; however when Bandinelli died, Ammannati&#x27;s design, bested the submissions of Benvenuto Cellini and Vincenzo Danti, to gain the commission. From 1563 and 1565, Ammannati and his assistants, among them Giambologna, sculpted the block of marble that had been chosen by Bandinelli. He took Grand Duke Cosimo I as model for Neptune&#x27;s face. The statue was meant to highlight Cosimo&#x27;s goal of establishing a Florentine Naval force. The ungainly sea god was placed at the corner of the Palazzo Vecchio within sight of Michelangelo&#x27;s David statue, and the then 87-year-old sculptor is said to have scoffed at Ammannati— saying that he had ruined a beautiful piece of marble— with the ditty: &quot;Ammannati, Ammanato, che bel marmo hai rovinato!&quot; Ammannati continued work on this fountain for a decade, adding around the perimeter a cornucopia of demigod figures: bronze reclining river gods, laughing satyrs and marble sea horses emerging from the water.

In 1550 Ammannati married Laura Battiferri, an elegant poet and an accomplished woman. Later in his life he had a religious crisis, influenced by Counter-Reformation piety, which resulted in condemning his own works depicting nudity, and he left all his possessions to the Jesuits.

He died in Florence in 1592.

<text>A bishop is an ordained member of the clergy who is entrusted with a position of authority and oversight in a religious institution. In Christianity, bishops are normally responsible for the governance and administration of dioceses. The role or office of the bishop is called episcopacy. Organizationally, several Christian denominations utilize ecclesiastical structures that call for the position of bishops, while other denominations have dispensed with this office, seeing it as a symbol of power. Bishops have also exercised political authority within their dioceses.

Traditionally, bishops claim apostolic succession, a direct historical lineage dating back to the original Twelve Apostles or Saint Paul. The bishops are by doctrine understood as those who possess the full priesthood given by Jesus Christ, and therefore may ordain other clergy, including other bishops. A person ordained as a deacon, priest (i.e. presbyter), and then bishop is understood to hold the fullness of the ministerial priesthood, given responsibility by Christ to govern, teach and sanctify the Body of Christ (the Church). Priests, deacons and lay ministers co-operate and assist their bishops in pastoral ministry. 

Some Pentecostal and other Protestant denominations have bishops who oversee congregations, though they do not necessarily claim apostolic succession.

== Etymology and terminology ==
The English word &quot;bishop&quot; derives, via Latin , Old English , and Middle English , from the Greek word , meaning &quot;overseer&quot; or &quot;supervisor&quot;. Greek was the language of the early Christian church, but the term did not originate in Christianity: it had been used in Greek for several centuries before the advent of Christianity.

The English words &quot;priest&quot; and &quot;presbyter&quot; both derive, via Latin, from the Greek word , meaning &quot;elder&quot; or &quot;senior&quot;, and not originally referring to priesthood.

In the early Christian era the two terms were not always clearly distinguished, but is used in the sense of the order or office of bishop, distinct from that of , in the writings attributed to Ignatius of Antioch in the second century.

== History in Christianity ==
The earliest organization of the Church in Jerusalem was, according to most scholars, similar to that of Jewish synagogues, but it had a council or college of ordained presbyters (). In Acts 11:30 and Acts 15:22, a collegiate system of government in Jerusalem is chaired by James the Just, according to tradition the first bishop of the city. In Acts 14:23, the Apostle Paul ordains presbyters in churches in Anatolia. The word &quot;presbyter&quot; was not yet distinguished from &quot;overseer&quot; (, later used exclusively to mean &quot;bishop&quot;), as in Acts 20:17, Titus 1:5–7 and 1 Peter 5:1. The earliest writings of the Apostolic Fathers, the Didache and the First Epistle of Clement, for example, show the church used two terms for local church offices—presbyters (seen by many as an interchangeable term with or overseer) and deacon.

In the First epistle to Timothy and Epistle to Titus in the New Testament a more clearly defined episcopate can be seen. Both letters state that Paul had left Timothy in Ephesus and Titus in Crete to oversee the local church. Paul commands Titus to ordain presbyters/bishops and to exercise general oversight.

Early sources are unclear but various groups of Christian communities may have had the bishop surrounded by a group or college functioning as leaders of the local churches. Eventually the head or &quot;monarchic&quot; bishop came to rule more clearly, and all local churches would eventually follow the example of the other churches and structure themselves after the model of the others with the one bishop in clearer charge, though the role of the body of presbyters remained important.

=== Apostolic Fathers ===
Around the end of the 1st century, the church&#x27;s organization became clearer in historical documents. In the works of the Apostolic Fathers, and Ignatius of Antioch in particular, the role of the episkopos, or bishop, became more important or, rather, already was very important and being clearly defined. While Ignatius of Antioch offers the earliest clear description of monarchial bishops (a single bishop over all house churches in a city) he is an advocate of monepiscopal structure rather than describing an accepted reality. To the bishops and house churches to which he writes, he offers strategies on how to pressure house churches who do not recognize the bishop into compliance. Other contemporary Christian writers do not describe monarchial bishops, either continuing to equate them with the presbyters or speaking of (bishops, plural) in a city.

Clement of Alexandria (end of the 2nd century) writes about the ordination of a certain Zachæus as bishop by the imposition of Simon Peter Bar-Jonah&#x27;s hands. The words bishop and ordination are used in their technical meaning by the same Clement of Alexandria. The bishops in the 2nd century are defined also as the only clergy to whom the ordination to priesthood (presbyterate) and diaconate is entrusted: &quot;a priest (presbyter) lays on hands, but does not ordain.&quot; ().

At the beginning of the 3rd century, Hippolytus of Rome describes another feature of the ministry of a bishop, which is that of the : the primate of sacrificial priesthood and the power to forgive sins.

== Christian bishops and civil government ==
The efficient organization of the Roman Empire became the template for the organisation of the church in the 4th century, particularly after Constantine&#x27;s Edict of Milan. As the church moved from the shadows of privacy into the public forum it acquired land for churches, burials and clergy. In 391, Theodosius I decreed that any land that had been confiscated from the church by Roman authorities be returned.

The most usual term for the geographic area of a bishop&#x27;s authority and ministry, the diocese, began as part of the structure of the Roman Empire under Diocletian. As Roman authority began to fail in the western portion of the empire, the church took over much of the civil administration. This can be clearly seen in the ministry of two popes: Pope Leo I in the 5th century, and Pope Gregory I in the 6th century. Both of these men were statesmen and public administrators in addition to their role as Christian pastors, teachers and leaders. In the Eastern churches, latifundia entailed to a bishop&#x27;s see were much less common, the state power did not collapse the way it did in the West, and thus the tendency of bishops acquiring civil power was much weaker than in the West. However, the role of Western bishops as civil authorities, often called prince bishops, continued throughout much of the Middle Ages.

=== Bishops holding political office ===

As well as being Archchancellors of the Holy Roman Empire after the 9th century, bishops generally served as chancellors to medieval monarchs, acting as head of the &quot;justiciary&quot; and chief chaplain. The Lord Chancellor of England was almost always a bishop up until the dismissal of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey by Henry VIII. Similarly, the position of Kanclerz in the Polish kingdom was always held by a bishop until the 16th century.

In modern times, the principality of Andorra is headed by Co-Princes of Andorra, one of whom is the Bishop of Urgell and the other, the sitting President of France, an arrangement that began with the Paréage of Andorra (1278), and was ratified in the 1993 constitution of Andorra.

The office of the Papacy is inherently held by the sitting Roman Catholic Bishop of Rome. Though not originally intended to hold temporal authority, since the Middle Ages the power of the Papacy gradually expanded deep into the secular realm and for centuries the sitting Bishop of Rome was the most powerful governmental office in Central Italy. In modern times, the Pope is also the sovereign Prince of Vatican City, an internationally recognized micro-state located entirely within the city of Rome.

In France, prior to the Revolution, representatives of the clergy — in practice, bishops and abbots of the largest monasteries — comprised the First Estate of the Estates-General. This role was abolished after separation of Church and State was implemented during the French Revolution.

In the 21st century, the more senior bishops of the Church of England continue to sit in the House of Lords of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, as representatives of the established church, and are known as Lords Spiritual. The Bishop of Sodor and Man, whose diocese lies outside the United Kingdom, is an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of the Legislative Council of the Isle of Man. In the past, the Bishop of Durham had extensive vice-regal powers within his northern diocese, which was a county palatine, the County Palatine of Durham, (previously, Liberty of Durham) of which he was &quot;ex officio&quot; the earl. In the 19th century, a gradual process of reform was enacted, with the majority of the bishop&#x27;s historic powers vested in The Crown by 1858.

Eastern Orthodox bishops, along with all other members of the clergy, are canonically forbidden to hold political office. Occasional exceptions to this rule are tolerated when the alternative is political chaos. In the Ottoman Empire, the Patriarch of Constantinople, for example, had de facto administrative, cultural and legal jurisdiction, as well as spiritual authority, over all Eastern Orthodox Christians of the empire, as part of the Ottoman millet system. An Orthodox bishop headed the Prince-Bishopric of Montenegro from 1516 to 1852, assisted by a secular &quot;guvernadur&quot;. More recently, Archbishop Makarios III of Cyprus, served as President of the Cyprus from 1960 to 1977, an extremely turbulent time period on the island.

In 2001, Peter Hollingworth, AC, OBE – then the Anglican Archbishop of Brisbane – was controversially appointed Governor-General of Australia. Although Hollingworth gave up his episcopal position to accept the appointment, it still attracted considerable opposition in a country which maintains a formal separation between Church and State.

=== Episcopacy during the English Civil War ===
During the period of the English Civil War, the role of bishops as wielders of political power and as upholders of the established church became a matter of heated political controversy. Presbyterianism was the polity of most Reformed Christianity in Europe, and had been favored by many in England since the English Reformation. Since in the primitive church the offices of &quot;presbyter&quot; and were not clearly distinguished, many Puritans held that this was the only form of government the church should have. The Anglican divine, Richard Hooker, objected to this claim in his famous work &quot;Of the Laws of Ecclesiastic Polity&quot; while, at the same time, defending Presbyterian ordination as valid (in particular Calvin&#x27;s ordination of Beza). This was the official stance of the English Church until the Commonwealth, during which time, the views of Presbyterians and Independents (Congregationalists) were more freely expressed and practiced.

=== Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Lutheran and Anglican churches ===


Bishops form the leadership in the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Churches, certain Lutheran churches, the Anglican Communion, the Independent Catholic churches, the Independent Anglican churches, and certain other, smaller, denominations.

The traditional role of a bishop is as pastor of a diocese (also called a bishopric, synod, eparchy or see), and so to serve as a &quot;diocesan bishop&quot;, or &quot;eparch&quot; as it is called in many Eastern Christian churches. Dioceses vary considerably in size, geographically and population-wise. Some dioceses around the Mediterranean Sea which were Christianised early are rather compact, whereas dioceses in areas of rapid modern growth in Christian commitment—as in some parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, South America and the Far East—are much larger and more populous.
As well as traditional diocesan bishops, many churches have a well-developed structure of church leadership that involves a number of layers of authority and responsibility.


















==== Duties ====

In Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodoxy, High Church Lutheranism, and Anglicanism, only a bishop can ordain other bishops, priests, and deacons.

In the Eastern liturgical tradition, a priest can celebrate the Divine Liturgy only with the blessing of a bishop. In Byzantine usage, an antimension signed by the bishop is kept on the altar partly as a reminder of whose altar it is and under whose omophorion the priest at a local parish is serving. In Syriac Church usage, a consecrated wooden block called a thabilitho is kept for the same reasons.

The bishop is the ordinary minister of the sacrament of confirmation in the Latin Church, and in the Old Catholic communion only a bishop may administer this sacrament. In the Lutheran and Anglican churches, the bishop normatively administers the rite of confirmation, although in those denominations that do not have an episcopal polity, confirmation is administered by the priest. However, in the Byzantine and other Eastern rites, whether Eastern or Oriental Orthodox or Eastern Catholic, chrismation is done immediately after baptism, and thus the priest is the one who confirms, using chrism blessed by a bishop.

==== Ordination of Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Lutheran and Anglican bishops ====

Bishops in all of these communions are ordained by other bishops through the laying on of hands. 
Ordination of a bishop, and thus continuation of apostolic succession, takes place through a ritual centred on the imposition of hands and prayer.

Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Anglican, Old Catholic and some Lutheran bishops claim to be part of the continuous sequence of ordained bishops since the days of the apostles referred to as apostolic succession.

In Scandinavia and the Baltic region, Lutheran churches participating in the Porvoo Communion (those of Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, and Lithuania), as well as many non-Porvoo membership Lutheran churches (including those of Kenya, Latvia, and Russia), as well as the confessional Communion of Nordic Lutheran Dioceses, believe that they ordain their bishops in the apostolic succession in lines stemming from the original apostles. &quot;The New Westminster Dictionary of Church History&quot; states that &quot;In Sweden the apostolic succession was preserved because the Catholic bishops were allowed to stay in office, but they had to approve changes in the ceremonies.&quot;

===== Peculiar to the Catholic Church =====
While traditional teaching maintains that any bishop with apostolic succession can validly perform the ordination of another bishop, some churches require two or three bishops participate, either to ensure sacramental validity or to conform with church law. Catholic doctrine holds that one bishop can validly ordain another (priest) as a bishop. Though a minimum of three bishops participating is desirable (there are usually several more) in order to demonstrate collegiality, canonically only one bishop is necessary. The practice of only one bishop ordaining was normal in countries where the church was persecuted under Communist rule.

The title of archbishop or metropolitan may be granted to a senior bishop, usually one who is in charge of a large ecclesiastical jurisdiction. He may, or may not, have provincial oversight of suffragan bishops and may possibly have auxiliary bishops assisting him.

Apart from the ordination, which is always done by other bishops, there are different methods as to the actual selection of a candidate for ordination as bishop. In the Catholic Church the Congregation for Bishops generally oversees the selection of new bishops with the approval of the pope. The papal nuncio usually solicits names from the bishops of a country, consults with priests and leading members of a laity, and then selects three to be forwarded to the Holy See. In Europe, some cathedral chapters have duties to elect bishops. The Eastern Catholic churches generally elect their own bishops. Most Eastern Orthodox churches allow varying amounts of formalised laity or lower clergy influence on the choice of bishops. This also applies in those Eastern churches which are in union with the pope, though it is required that he give assent.

The pope, in addition to being the Bishop of Rome and spiritual head of the Catholic Church, is also the Patriarch of the Latin Church. Each bishop within the Latin Church is answerable directly to the Pope and not any other bishop except to metropolitans in certain oversight instances. The pope previously used the title &quot;Patriarch of the West&quot;, but this title was dropped from use in 2006, a move which caused some concern within the Eastern Orthodox Communion as, to them, it implied wider papal jurisdiction.

===== Recognition of other churches&#x27; ordinations =====
The Catholic Church does recognise as valid (though illicit) ordinations done by breakaway Catholic, Old Catholic or Oriental bishops, and groups descended from them; it also regards as both valid and licit those ordinations done by bishops of the Eastern churches, so long as those receiving the ordination conform to other canonical requirements (for example, is an adult male) and an eastern orthodox rite of episcopal ordination, expressing the proper functions and sacramental status of a bishop, is used; this has given rise to the phenomenon of (for example, clergy of the Independent Catholic groups which claim apostolic succession, though this claim is rejected by both Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy). With respect to Lutheranism, &quot;the Catholic Church has never officially expressed its judgement on the validity of orders as they have been handed down by episcopal succession in these two national Lutheran churches&quot; (the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Sweden and the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland) though it does &quot;question how the ecclesiastical break in the 16th century has affected the apostolicity of the churches of the Reformation and thus the apostolicity of their ministry&quot;. 

Since Pope Leo XIII issued the bull in 1896, the Catholic Church has insisted that Anglican orders are invalid because of the Reformed changes in the Anglican ordination rites of the 16th century and divergence in understanding of the theology of priesthood, episcopacy and Eucharist. However, since the 1930s, Utrecht Old Catholic bishops (recognised by the Holy See as validly ordained) have sometimes taken part in the ordination of Anglican bishops. According to the writer Timothy Dufort, by 1969, all Church of England bishops had acquired Old Catholic lines of apostolic succession recognised by the Holy See. This development has been used to argue that the strain of apostolic succession has been re-introduced into Anglicanism, at least within the Church of England. However, other issues, such as the Anglican ordination of women, is at variance with Catholic understanding of Christian teaching, and have contributed to the reaffirmation of Catholic rejection of Anglican ordinations.

The Eastern Orthodox Churches do not accept the validity of any ordinations performed by the Independent Catholic groups, as Eastern Orthodoxy considers to be spurious any consecration outside the church as a whole. Eastern Orthodoxy considers apostolic succession to exist only within the Universal Church, and not through any authority held by individual bishops; thus, if a bishop ordains someone to serve outside the (Eastern Orthodox) Church, the ceremony is ineffectual, and no ordination has taken place regardless of the ritual used or the ordaining prelate&#x27;s position within the Eastern Orthodox Churches.

The position of the Catholic Church is slightly different. Whilst it does recognise the validity of the orders of certain groups which separated from communion with Holy See (for instance, the ordinations of the Old Catholics in communion with Utrecht, as well as the Polish National Catholic Church - which received its orders directly from Utrecht, and was until recently part of that communion), Catholicism does not recognise the orders of any group whose teaching is at variance with what they consider the core tenets of Christianity; this is the case even though the clergy of the Independent Catholic groups may use the proper ordination ritual. There are also other reasons why the Holy See does not recognise the validity of the orders of the Independent clergy:

* They hold that the continuing practice among many Independent clergy of one person receiving multiple ordinations in order to secure apostolic succession, betrays an incorrect and mechanistic theology of ordination.
* They hold that the practice within Independent groups of ordaining women (such as within certain member communities of the Anglican Communion) demonstrates an understanding of priesthood that they vindicate is totally unacceptable to the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches as they believe that the Universal Church does not possess such authority; thus, they uphold that any ceremonies performed by these women should be considered being sacramentally invalid.
* The theology of male clergy within the Independent movement is also suspect according to the Catholics, as they presumably approve of the ordination of females, and may have even undergone an (invalid) ordination ceremony conducted by a woman.

Whilst members of the Independent Catholic movement take seriously the issue of valid orders, it is highly significant that the relevant Vatican Congregations tend not to respond to petitions from Independent Catholic bishops and clergy who seek to be received into communion with the Holy See, hoping to continue in some sacramental role. In those instances where the pope does grant reconciliation, those deemed to be clerics within the Independent Old Catholic movement are invariably admitted as laity and not priests or bishops.

There is a mutual recognition of the validity of orders amongst Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Old Catholic, Oriental Orthodox and Assyrian Church of the East churches.

Some provinces of the Anglican Communion have begun ordaining women as bishops in recent decades – for example, England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Cuba. The first woman to be consecrated a bishop within Anglicanism was Barbara Harris, who was ordained in the United States in 1989. In 2006, Katharine Jefferts Schori, the Episcopal Bishop of Nevada, became the first woman to become the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church.

In the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada (ELCIC), the largest Lutheran Church bodies in the United States and Canada, respectively, and roughly based on the Nordic Lutheran national churches (similar to that of the Church of England), bishops are elected by Synod Assemblies, consisting of both lay members and clergy, for a term of six years, which can be renewed, depending upon the local synod&#x27;s &quot;constitution&quot; (which is mirrored on either the ELCA or ELCIC&#x27;s national constitution). Since the implementation of concordats between the ELCA and the Episcopal Church of the United States and the ELCIC and the Anglican Church of Canada, all bishops, including the presiding bishop (ELCA) or the national bishop (ELCIC), have been consecrated using the historic succession in line with bishops from the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Sweden, with at least one Anglican bishop serving as co-consecrator.

Since going into ecumenical communion with their respective Anglican body, bishops in the ELCA or the ELCIC not only approve the &quot;rostering&quot; of all ordained pastors, diaconal ministers, and associates in ministry, but they serve as the principal celebrant of all pastoral ordination and installation ceremonies, diaconal consecration ceremonies, as well as serving as the &quot;chief pastor&quot; of the local synod, upholding the teachings of Martin Luther as well as the documentations of the Ninety-Five Theses and the Augsburg Confession. Unlike their counterparts in the United Methodist Church, ELCA and ELCIC synod bishops do not appoint pastors to local congregations (pastors, like their counterparts in the Episcopal Church, are called by local congregations). The presiding bishop of the ELCA and the national bishop of the ELCIC, the national bishops of their respective bodies, are elected for a single 6-year term and may be elected to an additional term.

Although ELCA agreed with the Episcopal Church to limit ordination to the bishop &quot;ordinarily&quot;, ELCA pastor-&quot;ordinators&quot; are given permission to perform the rites in &quot;extraordinary&quot; circumstance. In practice, &quot;extraordinary&quot; circumstance have included disagreeing with Episcopalian views of the episcopate, and as a result, ELCA pastors ordained by other pastors are not permitted to be deployed to Episcopal Churches (they can, however, serve in Presbyterian Church USA, United Methodist Church, Reformed Church in America, and Moravian Church congregations, as the ELCA is in full communion with these denominations). The Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS) and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS), the second and third largest Lutheran bodies in the United States and the two largest Confessional Lutheran bodies in North America, do not follow an episcopal form of governance, settling instead on a form of quasi-congregationalism patterned off what they believe to be the practice of the early church. The second largest of the three predecessor bodies of the ELCA, the American Lutheran Church, was a congregationalist body, with national and synod presidents before they were re-titled as bishops (borrowing from the Lutheran churches in Germany) in the 1980s. With regard to ecclesial discipline and oversight, national and synod presidents typically function similarly to bishops in episcopal bodies.

=== Methodism ===
====African Methodist Episcopal Church====
In the African Methodist Episcopal Church, &quot;Bishops are the Chief Officers of the Connectional Organization. They are elected for life by a majority vote of the General Conference which meets every four years.&quot;

==== Christian Methodist Episcopal Church ====

In the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church in the United States, bishops are administrative superintendents of the church; they are elected by &quot;delegate&quot; votes for as many years deemed until the age of 74, then the bishop must retire. Among their duties, are responsibility for appointing clergy to serve local churches as pastor, for performing ordinations, and for safeguarding the doctrine and discipline of the church. The General Conference, a meeting every four years, has an equal number of clergy and lay delegates. In each Annual Conference, CME bishops serve for four-year terms. In 2010, Teresa E. Jefferson-Snorton was elected as a bishop, becoming the first woman to hold that position. As of 2024, she remains the only female bishop in CME.

==== United Methodist Church ====
In the United Methodist Church (the largest branch of Methodism in the world) bishops serve as administrative and pastoral superintendents of the church. They are elected for life from among the ordained elders (presbyters) by vote of the delegates in regional (called jurisdictional) conferences, and are consecrated by the other bishops present at the conference through the laying on of hands. In the United Methodist Church bishops remain members of the &quot;Order of Elders&quot; while being consecrated to the &quot;Office of the Episcopacy&quot;. Within the United Methodist Church only bishops are empowered to consecrate bishops and ordain clergy. Among their most critical duties is the ordination and appointment of clergy to serve local churches as pastor, presiding at sessions of the Annual, Jurisdictional, and General Conferences, providing pastoral ministry for the clergy under their charge, and safeguarding the doctrine and discipline of the church. Furthermore, individual bishops, or the Council of Bishops as a whole, often serve a prophetic role, making statements on important social issues and setting forth a vision for the denomination, though they have no legislative authority of their own. In all of these areas, bishops of the United Methodist Church function very much in the historic meaning of the term. According to the &quot;Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church&quot;, a bishop&#x27;s responsibilities are:

In each Annual Conference, United Methodist bishops serve for four-year terms, and may serve up to three terms before either retirement or appointment to a new Conference. United Methodist bishops may be male or female, with Marjorie Matthews being the first woman to be consecrated a bishop in 1980.

The collegial expression of episcopal leadership in the United Methodist Church is known as the Council of Bishops. The Council of Bishops speaks to the church and through the church into the world and gives leadership in the quest for Christian unity and interreligious relationships. The Conference of Methodist Bishops includes the United Methodist &quot;Council of Bishops&quot; plus bishops from affiliated autonomous Methodist or United Churches.

John Wesley consecrated Thomas Coke a &quot;General Superintendent&quot;, and directed that Francis Asbury also be consecrated for the United States of America in 1784, where the Methodist Episcopal Church first became a separate denomination apart from the Church of England. Coke soon returned to England, but Asbury was the primary builder of the new church. At first he did not call himself bishop, but eventually submitted to the usage by the denomination.

Notable bishops in United Methodist history include Coke, Asbury, Richard Whatcoat, Philip William Otterbein, Martin Boehm, Jacob Albright, John Seybert, Matthew Simpson, John S. Stamm, William Ragsdale Cannon, Marjorie Matthews, Leontine T. Kelly, William B. Oden, Ntambo Nkulu Ntanda, Joseph Sprague, William Henry Willimon, and Thomas Bickerton.

=== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ===
In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Bishop is the leader of a local congregation, called a ward. As with most LDS priesthood holders, the bishop is a part-time lay minister and earns a living through other employment. As such, it is his duty to preside, call local leaders, and judge the worthiness of members for certain activities. The bishop does not deliver sermons at every service (generally asking members to do so), but is expected to be a spiritual guide for his congregation. It is therefore believed that he has both the right and ability to receive divine inspiration (through the Holy Spirit) for the ward under his direction. Because it is a part-time position, all able members are expected to assist in the management of the ward by holding delegated lay positions (for example, women&#x27;s and youth leaders, teachers) referred to as callings. The bishop is especially responsible for leading the youth, in connection with the fact that a bishop is the president of the Aaronic priesthood in his ward (and is thus a form of Mormon Kohen). Although members are asked to confess serious sins to him, unlike the Catholic Church, he is not the instrument of divine forgiveness, but merely a guide through the repentance process (and a judge in case transgressions warrant excommunication or other official discipline). The bishop is also responsible for the physical welfare of the ward, and thus collects tithing and fast offerings and distributes financial assistance where needed.

A literal descendant of Aaron has &quot;legal right&quot; to act as a bishop after being found worthy and ordained by the First Presidency. In the absence of a literal descendant of Aaron, a high priest in the Melchizedek priesthood is called to be a bishop. Each bishop is selected from resident members of the ward by the stake presidency with approval of the First Presidency, and chooses two &quot;counselors&quot; to form a &quot;bishopric&quot;. An priesthood holder called as bishop must be ordained a high priest if he is not already one, unlike the similar function of branch president. In special circumstances (such as a ward consisting entirely of young university students), a bishop may be chosen from outside the ward. Traditionally, bishops are married, though this is not always the case. A bishop is typically released after about five years and a new bishop is called to the position. Although the former bishop is released from his duties, he continues to hold the Aaronic priesthood office of bishop. Church members frequently refer to a former bishop as &quot;Bishop&quot; as a sign of respect and affection.

Latter-day Saint bishops do not wear any special clothing or insignia the way clergy in many other churches do, but are expected to dress and groom themselves neatly and conservatively per their local culture, especially when performing official duties. Bishops (as well as other members of the priesthood) can trace their line of authority back to Joseph Smith, who, according to church doctrine, was ordained to lead the church in modern times by the ancient apostles Peter, James, and John, who were ordained to lead the Church by Jesus Christ.

At the global level, the presiding bishop oversees the temporal affairs (buildings, properties, commercial corporations, and so on) of the worldwide church, including the church&#x27;s massive global humanitarian aid and social welfare programs. The presiding bishop has two counselors; the three together form the presiding bishopric. As opposed to ward bishoprics, where the counselors do not hold the office of bishop, all three men in the presiding bishopric hold the office of bishop, and thus the counselors, as with the presiding bishop, are formally referred to as &quot;Bishop&quot;.

=== Irvingism ===
==== New Apostolic Church ====
The New Apostolic Church (NAC) knows three classes of ministries: Deacons, Priests and Apostles. The Apostles, who are all included in the apostolate with the Chief Apostle as head, are the highest ministries.

Of the several kinds of priest...ministries, the bishop is the highest. Nearly all bishops are set in line directly from the chief apostle. They support and help their superior apostle.

=== Pentecostalism ===
==== Church of God in Christ ====
In the Church of God in Christ (COGIC), the ecclesiastical structure is composed of large dioceses that are called &quot;jurisdictions&quot; within COGIC, each under the authority of a bishop, sometimes called &quot;state bishops&quot;. They can either be made up of large geographical regions of churches or churches that are grouped and organized together as their own separate jurisdictions because of similar affiliations, regardless of geographical location or dispersion. Each state in the U.S. has at least one jurisdiction while others may have several more, and each jurisdiction is usually composed of between 30 and 100 churches. Each jurisdiction is then broken down into several districts, which are smaller groups of churches (either grouped by geographical situation or by similar affiliations) which are each under the authority of District Superintendents who answer to the authority of their jurisdictional/state bishop. There are currently over 170 jurisdictions in the United States, and over 30 jurisdictions in other countries. The bishops of each jurisdiction, according to the COGIC Manual, are considered to be the modern day equivalent in the church of the early apostles and overseers of the New Testament church, and as the highest ranking clergymen in the COGIC, they are tasked with the responsibilities of being the head overseers of all religious, civil, and economic ministries and protocol for the church denomination. They also have the authority to appoint and ordain local pastors, elders, ministers, and reverends within the denomination. The bishops of the COGIC denomination are all collectively called &quot;The Board of Bishops&quot;. From the Board of Bishops, and the General Assembly of the COGIC, the body of the church composed of clergy and lay delegates that are responsible for making and enforcing the bylaws of the denomination, every four years, twelve bishops from the COGIC are elected as &quot;The General Board&quot; of the church, who work alongside the delegates of the General Assembly and Board of Bishops to provide administration over the denomination as the church&#x27;s head executive leaders. One of twelve bishops of the General Board is also elected the &quot;presiding bishop&quot; of the church, and two others are appointed by the presiding bishop himself, as his first and second assistant presiding bishops.

Bishops in the Church of God in Christ usually wear black clergy suits which consist of a black suit blazer, black pants, a purple or scarlet clergy shirt and a white clerical collar, which is usually referred to as &quot;Class B Civic attire&quot;. Bishops in COGIC also typically wear the Anglican Choir Dress style vestments of a long purple or scarlet chimere, cuffs, and tippet worn over a long white rochet, and a gold pectoral cross worn around the neck with the tippet. This is usually referred to as &quot;Class A Ceremonial attire&quot;. The bishops of COGIC alternate between Class A Ceremonial attire and Class B Civic attire depending on the protocol of the religious services and other events they have to attend.

==== Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee) ====
In the polity of the Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee), the international leader is the presiding bishop, and the members of the executive committee are executive bishops. Collectively, they supervise and appoint national and state leaders across the world. Leaders of individual states and regions are administrative bishops, who have jurisdiction over local churches in their respective states and are vested with appointment authority for local pastorates. All ministers are credentialed at one of three levels of licensure, the most senior of which is the rank of ordained bishop. To be eligible to serve in state, national, or international positions of authority, a minister must hold the rank of ordained bishop.

==== Pentecostal Church of God ====
In 2002, the general convention of the Pentecostal Church of God came to a consensus to change the title of their overseer from general superintendent to bishop. The change was brought on because internationally, the term &quot;bishop&quot; is more commonly related to religious leaders than the previous title.

The title &quot;bishop&quot; is used for both the general (international leader) and the district (state) leaders. The title is sometimes used in conjunction with the previous, thus becoming general (district) superintendent/bishop.

=== Seventh-day Adventists ===

According to the Seventh-day Adventist understanding of the doctrine of the church:

&quot;The &quot;elders&quot; (Greek, ) or &quot;bishops&quot; () were the most important officers of the church. The term elder means older one, implying dignity and respect. His position was similar to that of the one who had supervision of the synagogue. The term bishop means &quot;overseer&quot;. Paul used these terms interchangeably, equating elders with overseers or bishops (Acts 20:17,28; Titus 1:5, 7).

&quot;Those who held this position supervised the newly formed churches. Elder referred to the status or rank of the office, while bishop denoted the duty or responsibility of the office—&quot;overseer&quot;. Since the apostles also called themselves elders (1 Peter 5:1; 2 John 1; 3 John 1), it is apparent that there were both local elders and itinerant elders, or elders at large. But both kinds of elder functioned as shepherds of the congregations.&quot;

The above understanding is part of the basis of Adventist organizational structure. The world wide Seventh-day Adventist church is organized into local districts, conferences or missions, union conferences or union missions, divisions, and finally at the top is the general conference. At each level (with exception to the local districts), there is an elder who is elected president and a group of elders who serve on the executive committee with the elected president. Those who have been elected president would in effect be the &quot;bishop&quot; while never actually carrying the title or ordained as such because the term is usually associated with the episcopal style of church governance most often found in Catholic, Anglican, Methodist and some Pentecostal/Charismatic circles.

=== Others ===
Some Baptists also have begun taking on the title of &quot;bishop&quot;.
In some smaller Protestant denominations and independent churches, the term &quot;bishop&quot; is used in the same way as &quot;pastor&quot;, to refer to the leader of the local congregation, and may be male or female. This usage is especially common in African-American churches in the US.

In the Church of Scotland, which has a Presbyterian church structure, the word &quot;bishop&quot; refers to an ordained person, usually a normal parish minister, who has temporary oversight of a trainee minister. In the Presbyterian Church (USA), the term bishop is an expressive name for a Minister of Word and Sacrament who serves a congregation and exercises &quot;the oversight of the flock of Christ.&quot; The term is traceable to the 1789 Form of Government of the PC (USA) and the Presbyterian understanding of the pastoral office.

While not considered orthodox Christian, the Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica uses roles and titles derived from Christianity for its clerical hierarchy, including bishops who have much the same authority and responsibilities as in Catholicism.

The Salvation Army does not have bishops but has appointed leaders of geographical areas, known as Divisional Commanders. Larger geographical areas, called Territories, are led by a Territorial Commander, who is the highest-ranking officer in that Territory.

Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses do not use the title &#x27;Bishop&#x27; within their organizational structure, but appoint elders to be overseers (to fulfill the role of oversight) within their congregations.

The Batak Christian Protestant Church of Indonesia, the most prominent Protestant denomination in Indonesia, uses the term &quot;Ephorus&quot; instead of &quot;bishop&quot;.

In the Vietnamese syncretist religion of Caodaism, bishops () comprise the fifth of nine hierarchical levels, and are responsible for spiritual and temporal education as well as record-keeping and ceremonies in their parishes. At any one time there are seventy-two bishops. Their authority is described in Section I of the text (revealed through seances in December 1926). Caodai bishops wear robes and headgear of embroidered silk depicting the Divine Eye and the Eight Trigrams. (The color varies according to branch.) This is the full ceremonial dress; the simple version consists of a seven-layered turban.

== Dress and insignia in Christianity ==
Traditionally, a number of items are associated with the office of a bishop, most notably the mitre and the crosier. Other vestments and insignia vary between Eastern and Western Christianity.

In the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church, the choir dress of a bishop includes the purple cassock with amaranth trim, rochet, purple zucchetto (skull cap), purple biretta, and pectoral cross. The cappa magna may be worn, but only within the bishop&#x27;s own diocese and on especially solemn occasions. The mitre, zucchetto, and stole are generally worn by bishops when presiding over liturgical functions. For liturgical functions other than the Mass the bishop typically wears the cope. Within his own diocese and when celebrating solemnly elsewhere with the consent of the local ordinary, he also uses the crosier. When celebrating Mass, a bishop, like a priest, wears the chasuble. The Caeremoniale Episcoporum recommends, but does not impose, that in solemn celebrations a bishop should also wear a dalmatic, which can always be white, beneath the chasuble, especially when administering the sacrament of holy orders, blessing an abbot or abbess, and dedicating a church or an altar. The Caeremoniale Episcoporum no longer makes mention of episcopal gloves, episcopal sandals, liturgical stockings (also known as buskins), or the accoutrements that it once prescribed for the bishop&#x27;s horse. The coat of arms of a Latin Church Catholic bishop usually displays a galero with a cross and crosier behind the escutcheon; the specifics differ by location and ecclesiastical rank (see Ecclesiastical heraldry).

Anglican bishops generally make use of the mitre, crosier, ecclesiastical ring, purple cassock, purple zucchetto, and pectoral cross. However, the traditional choir dress of Anglican bishops retains its late mediaeval form, and looks quite different from that of their Catholic counterparts; it consists of a long rochet which is worn with a chimere.

In the Eastern Churches (Eastern Orthodox, Eastern Rite Catholic) a bishop will wear the mandyas, panagia (and perhaps an enkolpion), sakkos, omophorion and an Eastern-style mitre. Eastern bishops do not normally wear an episcopal ring; the faithful kiss (or, alternatively, touch their forehead to) the bishop&#x27;s hand. To seal official documents, he will usually use an inked stamp. An Eastern bishop&#x27;s coat of arms will normally display an Eastern-style mitre, cross, eastern style crosier and a red and white (or red and gold) mantle. The arms of Oriental Orthodox bishops will display the episcopal insignia (mitre or turban) specific to their own liturgical traditions. Variations occur based upon jurisdiction and national customs.

=== Cathedra ===
In Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Lutheran and Anglican cathedrals there is a special chair set aside for the exclusive use of the bishop. This is the bishop&#x27;s &quot;cathedra&quot; and is often called the throne. In some Christian denominations, for example, the Anglican Communion, parish churches may maintain a chair for the use of the bishop when he visits; this is to signify the parish&#x27;s union with the bishop.

==The term&#x27;s use in non-Christian religions==
=== Buddhism ===
The leader of the Buddhist Churches of America (BCA) is their bishop, The Japanese title for the bishop of the BCA is , although the English title is favored over the Japanese. When it comes to many other Buddhist terms, the BCA chose to keep them in their original language (terms such as and ), but with some words (including ), they changed/translated these terms into English words.

Between 1899 and 1944, the BCA held the name Buddhist Mission of North America. The leader of the Buddhist Mission of North America was called (superintendent/director) between 1899 and 1918. In 1918 the was promoted to bishop (). However, according to George J. Tanabe, the title &quot;bishop&quot; was in practice already used by Hawaiian Shin Buddhists (in Honpa Hongwanji Mission of Hawaii) even when the official title was &quot;kantoku&quot;.

Bishops are also present in other Japanese Buddhist organizations. Higashi Hongan-ji&#x27;s North American District, Honpa Honganji Mission of Hawaii, Jodo Shinshu Buddhist Temples of Canada, a Jodo Shu temple in Los Angeles, the Shingon temple Koyasan Buddhist Temple, Sōtō Mission in Hawai‘i (a Soto Zen Buddhist institution), and the Sōtō Zen Buddhist Community of South America () all have or have had leaders with the title bishop. As for the Sōtō Zen Buddhist Community of South America, the Japanese title is , but the leader is in practice referred to as &quot;bishop&quot;.

=== Tenrikyo ===
Tenrikyo is a Japanese New Religion with influences from both Shinto and Buddhism. The leader of the Tenrikyo North American Mission has the title of bishop.

<text>Bertrand Andrieu (24 November 1761 – 6 December 1822) was a French engraver of medals. He was born in Bordeaux. In France, he was considered as the restorer of the art, which had declined after the time of Louis XIV. During the last twenty years of his life, the French government commissioned him to undertake every major work of importance.

<text>Bordeaux (, ; ; Gascon ; ) is a city on the river Garonne in the Gironde department, southwestern France. A port city, it is the capital of the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region, as well as the prefecture of the Gironde department. Its inhabitants are called &quot;&quot;Bordelais&quot; (masculine) or &quot;&quot;Bordelaises&quot; (feminine). The term &quot;Bordelais&quot; may also refer to the city and its surrounding region.

The city of Bordeaux proper had a population of 259,809 in 2020 within its small municipal territory of , but together with its suburbs and exurbs the Bordeaux metropolitan area had a population of 1,376,375 that same year (Jan. 2020 census), the sixth-most populated in France after Paris, Lyon, Marseille, Lille, and Toulouse.

Bordeaux and 27 suburban municipalities form the Bordeaux Metropolis, an indirectly elected metropolitan authority now in charge of wider metropolitan issues. The Bordeaux Metropolis, with a population of 819,604 at the January 2020 census, is the fifth most populated metropolitan council in France after those of Paris, Marseille, Lyon and Lille.

Bordeaux is a world capital of wine: many châteaux and vineyards stand on the hillsides of the Gironde, and the city is home to the world&#x27;s main wine fair, Vinexpo. Bordeaux is also one of the centers of gastronomy and business tourism for the organization of international congresses. It is a central and strategic hub for the aeronautics, military and space sector, home to major companies such as Dassault Aviation, ArianeGroup, Safran and Thales. The link with aviation dates back to 1910, the year the first airplane flew over the city. A crossroads of knowledge through university research, it is home to one of the only two megajoule lasers in the world, as well as a university population of more than 130,000 students within the Bordeaux Metropolis.

Bordeaux is an international tourist destination for its architectural and cultural heritage with more than 362 historic monuments, making it, after Paris, the city with the most listed or registered monuments in France. The &quot;Pearl of Aquitaine&quot; has been voted European Destination of the year in a 2015 online poll. The metropolis has also received awards and rankings by international organizations such as in 1957, Bordeaux was awarded the Europe Prize for its efforts in transmitting the European ideal. In June 2007, the Port of the Moon in historic Bordeaux was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, for its outstanding architecture and urban ensemble and in recognition of Bordeaux&#x27;s international importance over the last 2000 years. Bordeaux is also ranked as a Sufficiency city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.

== History ==
=== 5th century BC to 11th century AD ===
Around 300 BC, the region was the settlement of a Celtic tribe, the Bituriges Vivisci, who named the town Burdigala, probably of Aquitanian origin.

In 107 BC, the Battle of Burdigala was fought by the Romans who were defending the Allobroges, a Gallic tribe allied to Rome, and the Tigurini led by Divico. The Romans were defeated and their commander, the consul Lucius Cassius Longinus, was killed in battle.

The city came under Roman rule around 60 BC, and it became an important commercial centre for tin and lead. During this period were built the amphitheatre and the monument &quot;Les Piliers de Tutelle&quot;.

In 276 AD, it was sacked by the Vandals. The Vandals attacked again in 409, followed by the Visigoths in 414, and the Franks in 498, and afterwards the city fell into a period of relative obscurity.


In the late 6th century AD the city re-emerged as the seat of a county and an archdiocese within the Merovingian kingdom of the Franks, but royal Frankish power was never strong. The city started to play a regional role as a major urban center on the fringes of the newly founded Frankish Duchy of Vasconia. Around 585 Gallactorius was made Count of Bordeaux and fought the Basques.

In 732, the city was plundered by the troops of Abd er Rahman who stormed the fortifications and overwhelmed the Aquitanian garrison. Duke Eudes mustered a force to engage the Umayyads, eventually engaging them in the Battle of the River Garonne somewhere near the river Dordogne. The battle had a high death toll, and although Eudes was defeated he had enough troops to engage in the Battle of Poitiers and so retain his grip on Aquitaine.

In 737, following his father Eudes&#x27;s death, the Aquitanian duke Hunald led a rebellion to which Charles responded by launching an expedition that captured Bordeaux. However, it was not retained for long, during the following year the Frankish commander clashed in battle with the Aquitanians but then left to take on hostile Burgundian authorities and magnates. In 745 Aquitaine faced another expedition where Charles&#x27;s sons Pepin and Carloman challenged Hunald&#x27;s power and defeated him. Hunald&#x27;s son Waifer replaced him and confirmed Bordeaux as the capital city (along with Bourges in the north).

During the last stage of the war against Aquitaine (760–768), it was one of Waifer&#x27;s last important strongholds to fall to the troops of King Pepin the Short. Charlemagne built the fortress of Fronsac (&quot;Frontiacus&quot;, &quot;Franciacus&quot;) near Bordeaux on a hill across the border with the Basques (&quot;Wascones&quot;), where Basque commanders came and pledged their loyalty (769).

In 778, Seguin (or Sihimin) was appointed count of Bordeaux, probably undermining the power of the Duke Lupo, and possibly leading to the Battle of Roncevaux Pass. In 814, Seguin was made Duke of Vasconia, but was deposed in 816 for failing to suppress a Basque rebellion. Under the Carolingians, sometimes the Counts of Bordeaux held the title concomitantly with that of Duke of Vasconia. They were to keep the Basques in check and defend the mouth of the Garonne from the Vikings when they appeared in c. 844. In Autumn 845, the Vikings were raiding Bordeaux and Saintes, count Seguin II marched on them but was captured and executed.

Although the port of Bordeaux was a buzzing trade center, the stability and success of the city was threatened by Viking and Norman incursions and political instability. The restoration of the Ramnulfid Dukes of Aquitaine under William IV and his successors (known as the House of Poitiers) brought continuity of government.

=== 12th century to 15th century, the English era ===
From the 12th to the 15th century, Bordeaux flourished once more following the marriage of Eléonore, Duchess of Aquitaine and the last of the House of Poitiers, to Henry II Plantagenêt, Count of Anjou and the grandson of Henry I of England, who succeeded to the English crown months after their wedding, bringing into being the vast Angevin Empire, which stretched from the Pyrenees to Ireland. After granting a tax-free trade status with England, Henry was adored by the locals as they could be even more profitable in the wine trade, their main source of income, and the city benefited from imports of cloth and wheat. The belfry (Grosse Cloche) and city cathedral St-André were built, the latter in 1227, incorporating the artisan quarter of Saint-Paul. Under the terms of the Treaty of Brétigny it became briefly the capital of an independent state (1362–1372) under Edward, the Black Prince, but after the Battle of Castillon (1453) it was annexed by France.

=== 15th century to 17th century ===
In 1462, Bordeaux created a local parliament.

Bordeaux adhered to the Fronde, being effectively annexed to the Kingdom of France only in 1653, when the army of Louis XIV entered the city.

=== 18th century, the golden era ===
The 18th century saw another golden age of Bordeaux. The Port of the Moon supplied the majority of Europe with coffee, cocoa, sugar, cotton and indigo, becoming France&#x27;s busiest port and the second busiest port in the world after London. Many downtown buildings (about 5,000), including those on the quays, are from this period.

Bordeaux was also a major trading centre for slaves. In total, the Bordeaux shipowners deported 150,000 Africans in some 500 expeditions.

=== French Revolution: political disruption and loss of the most profitable colony ===
At the beginning of the French Revolution (1789), many local revolutionaries were members of the Girondists. This Party represented the provincial bourgeoisie, favorable towards abolishing aristocracy privileges, but opposed to the Revolution&#x27;s social dimension. The Gironde valley&#x27;s economic value and significance was satiated by the city&#x27;s commercial power which was in dire contrast to the emerging widespread poverty affecting its inhabitants. Trade and commerce were the driving factors in the region&#x27;s economic prosperity, still this resulted in a significant number of locals struggling to survive on a daily basis due to lack of food and resources. This socioeconomic disparity served as fertile ground for discontent, sparking frequent episodes of mass unrest well before the tumultuous events of 1783. [1]

In 1793, the Montagnards led by Robespierre and Marat came to power. Fearing a bourgeois misappropriation of the Revolution, they executed a great number of Girondists. During the purge, the local Montagnard Section renamed the city of Bordeaux &quot;Commune-Franklin&quot; (Franklin-municipality) in homage to Benjamin Franklin.

At the same time, in 1791, a slave revolt broke out at Saint-Domingue (current Haiti), the most profitable of the French colonies. In the lively era of the 18th century, Bordeaux emerged as a center of economic activity, particularly known at first for its successful wine trade. The city&#x27;s placement along the Gironde River was very strategic, helping to facilitate the transportation of produce to markets both internationally and domestically, which led to an increase in exports and Bordeaux&#x27;s economic prosperity. There was a significant transformation to the economic landscape of Bordeaux in 1785, which was spurred by the attraction of large profits, traders and merchants in Bordeaux began to turn their attention to the slave trade. This was a very important moment in the city&#x27;s economic history seeing as it diversified its commercial expansion, at a serious moral cost. This introduced a new layer of difficulty to Bordeaux&#x27;s economic activities. Even though it brought along significant wealth to certain segments of society, it complicated the socio-economic inconsistencies within the region. The entry into the slave trade brought even more tension within Bordeaux society. The trade exacerbated the divide between an elite with growing wealth and those living in poverty. This economic divide laid out the foundation for the mass unrest that would break out in the French Revolution. [2]

Three years later, the Montagnard Convention abolished slavery. In 1802, Napoleon revoked the manumission law but lost the war against the army of former slaves. In 1804, Haiti became independent. The loss of this &quot;Pearl&quot; of the West Indies generated the collapse of Bordeaux&#x27;s port economy, which was dependent on the colonial trade and trade in slaves.

Towards the end of the Peninsular War of 1814, the Duke of Wellington sent William Beresford with two divisions and seized Bordeaux, encountering little resistance. Bordeaux was largely anti-Bonapartist and the majority supported the Bourbons. The British troops were treated as liberators. Distinguished historian of the French revolution Suzanne Desan explains that &quot;examining intricate local dynamics&quot; is essential to studying the Revolution by region. [3]

=== 19th century, rebirth of the economy ===
From the Bourbon Restoration, the economy of Bordeaux was rebuilt by traders and shipowners. They engaged to construct the first bridge of Bordeaux, and customs warehouses. The shipping traffic grew through the new African colonies.

Georges-Eugène Haussmann, a longtime prefect of Bordeaux, used Bordeaux&#x27;s 18th-century large-scale rebuilding as a model when he was asked by Emperor Napoleon III to transform the quasi-medieval Paris into a &quot;modern&quot; capital that would make France proud. Victor Hugo found the town so beautiful he said: &quot;Take Versailles, add Antwerp, and you have Bordeaux&quot;.

In 1870, at the beginning of the Franco-Prussian war against Prussia, the French government temporarily relocated to Bordeaux from Paris. That recurred during World War I and again very briefly during World War II, when it became clear that Paris would fall into German hands.

=== 20th century ===
During World War II, Bordeaux fell under German occupation.

In May and June 1940, Bordeaux was the site of the life-saving actions of the Portuguese consul-general, Aristides de Sousa Mendes, who illegally granted thousands of Portuguese visas, which were needed to pass the Spanish border, to refugees fleeing the German occupation.

From 1941 to 1943, the Italian Royal Navy established BETASOM, a submarine base at Bordeaux. Italian submarines participated in the Battle of the Atlantic from that base, which was also a major base for German U-boats as headquarters of 12th U-boat Flotilla. The massive, reinforced concrete U-boat pens have proved impractical to demolish and are now partly used as a cultural center for exhibitions.

=== 21st century, listed as World heritage ===
In 2007, 40% of the city surface area, located around the Port of the Moon, was listed as World Heritage Site. UNESCO inscribed Bordeaux as &quot;an inhabited historic city, an outstanding urban and architectural ensemble, created in the age of the Enlightenment, whose values continued up to the first half of the 20th century, with more protected buildings than any other French city except Paris&quot;.

== Geography ==

Bordeaux is located close to the European Atlantic coast, in the southwest of France and in the north of the Aquitaine region. It is around southwest of Paris. The city is built on a bend of the river Garonne, and is divided into two parts: the right bank to the east and left bank in the west. Historically the left bank is more developed because when flowing outside the bend, the water makes a furrow of the required depth to allow the passing of merchant ships, which used to offload on this side of the river. But, today, the right bank is developing, including new urban projects. In Bordeaux, the Garonne River is accessible to ocean liners through the Gironde estuary. The right bank of the Garonne is a low-lying, often marshy plain.

=== Climate ===
Bordeaux&#x27;s climate can be classified as oceanic (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;), bordering on a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;). However, the Trewartha climate classification system classifies the city as solely humid subtropical, due to a recent rise in temperatures related – to some degree or another – to climate change and the city&#x27;s urban heat island.

The city enjoys cool to mild, wet winters, due to its relatively southerly latitude, and the prevalence of mild, westerly winds from the Atlantic. Its summers are warm and somewhat drier, although wet enough to avoid a Mediterranean classification. Frosts occur annually, but snowfall is quite infrequent, occurring for no more than 3–4 days a year. The summer of 2003 set a record with an average temperature of , while February 1956 was the coldest month on record with an average temperature of −2.00 °C at Bordeaux Mérignac-Airport.

== Economy ==
Bordeaux is a major centre for business in France as it has the sixth largest metropolitan population in France. It serves as a major regional center for trade, administration, services and industry.

=== Wine ===

The vine was introduced to the Bordeaux region by the Romans, probably in the mid-first century, to provide wine for local consumption, and wine production has been continuous in the region since.

Bordeaux wine growing area has about of vineyards, 57 appellations, 10,000 wine-producing estates (châteaux) and 13,000 grape growers. With an annual production of approximately 960 million bottles, the Bordeaux area produces large quantities of everyday wine as well as some of the most expensive wines in the world. Included among the latter are the area&#x27;s five &quot;premier cru&quot; (First Growth) red wines (four from Médoc and one, Château Haut-Brion, from Graves), established by the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855:

Both red and white wines are made in the Bordeaux region. Red Bordeaux wine is called claret in the United Kingdom. Red wines are generally made from a blend of grapes, and may be made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit verdot, Malbec, and, less commonly in recent years, Carménère.

White Bordeaux is made from Sauvignon blanc, Sémillon, and Muscadelle. Sauternes is a sub-region of Graves known for its intensely sweet, white, dessert wines such as Château d&#x27;Yquem.

Because of a wine glut (wine lake) in the generic production, the price squeeze induced by an increasingly strong international competition, and vine pull schemes, the number of growers has recently dropped from 14,000 and the area under vine has also decreased significantly. In the meantime, the global demand for first growths and the most famous labels markedly increased and their prices skyrocketed.

The Cité du Vin, a museum as well as a place of exhibitions, shows, movie projections and academic seminars on the theme of wine opened its doors in June 2016.

=== Others ===
The Laser Mégajoule will be one of the most powerful lasers in the world, allowing fundamental research and the development of the laser and plasma technologies.

Some 15,000 people work for the aeronautic industry in Bordeaux. The city has some of the biggest companies including Dassault, EADS Sogerma, Snecma, Thales, SNPE, and others. The Dassault Falcon private jets are built there as well as the military aircraft Rafale and Mirage 2000, the Airbus A380 cockpit, the boosters of Ariane 5, and the M51 SLBM missile.

Tourism, especially wine tourism, is a major industry. Globelink.co.uk mentioned Bordeaux as the best tourist destination in Europe in 2015. Gourmet Touring is a tourism company operating in the Bordeaux wine region.

Access to the port from the Atlantic is via the Gironde estuary. Almost nine million tonnes of goods arrive and leave each year.

=== Major companies ===
This list includes indigenous Bordeaux-based companies and companies that have major presence in Bordeaux, but are not necessarily headquartered there.

== Population ==
In January 2020, there were 259,809 inhabitants in the city proper (commune) of Bordeaux. The commune (including Caudéran which was annexed by Bordeaux in 1965) had its largest population of 284,494 at the 1954 census. The majority of the population is French, but there are sizable groups of Italians, Spaniards (Up to 20% of the Bordeaux population claim some degree of Spanish heritage), Portuguese, Turks, Germans.

The built-up area has grown for more than a century beyond the municipal borders of Bordeaux due to the small size of the commune () and urban sprawl. By January 2020 there were 1,376,375 people living in the overall metropolitan area (&quot;aire d&#x27;attraction&quot;) of Bordeaux, only a fifth of whom lived in the city proper.
== Politics ==

=== Municipal administration ===

The Mayor of the city is the environmentalist Pierre Hurmic.

Bordeaux is the capital of five cantons and the Prefecture of the Gironde and Aquitaine.

The town is divided into three districts, the first three of Gironde. The headquarters of Urban Community of Bordeaux Mériadeck is located in the neighbourhood and the city is at the head of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry that bears his name.

The number of inhabitants of Bordeaux is greater than 250,000 and less than 299,999 so the number of municipal councilors is 65. They are divided according to the following composition:
=== Mayors of Bordeaux ===

Since the Liberation (1944), there have been six mayors of Bordeaux:

* RPR was renamed to UMP in 2002 which was later renamed to LR in 2015.

=== Elections ===

==== Presidential elections of 2007 ====
At the 2007 presidential election, the Bordelais gave 31.37% of their votes to Ségolène Royal of the Socialist Party against 30.84% to Nicolas Sarkozy, president of the UMP. Then came François Bayrou with 22.01%, followed by Jean-Marie Le Pen who recorded 5.42%. None of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. Nationally, Nicolas Sarkozy led with 31.18%, then Ségolène Royal with 25.87%, followed by François Bayrou with 18.57%. After these came Jean-Marie Le Pen with 10.44%, none of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. In the second round, the city of Bordeaux gave Ségolène Royal 52.44% against 47.56% for Nicolas Sarkozy, the latter being elected President of the Republic with 53.06% against 46.94% for Ségolène Royal. The abstention rates for Bordeaux were 14.52% in the first round and 15.90% in the second round.

==== Parliamentary elections of 2007 ====
In the parliamentary elections of 2007, the left won eight constituencies against only three for the right. After the partial 2008 elections, the eighth district of Gironde switched to the left, bringing the count to nine. In Bordeaux, the left was for the first time in its history the majority as it held two of three constituencies following the elections. In the first division of the Gironde, the outgoing UMP MP Chantal Bourragué was well ahead with 44.81% against 25.39% for the Socialist candidate Béatrice Desaigues. In the second round, it was Chantal Bourragué who was re-elected with 54.45% against 45.55% for his socialist opponent. In the second district of Gironde the UMP mayor and all new Minister of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and the Sea Alain Juppé confronted the General Counsel PS Michèle Delaunay. In the first round, Alain Juppé was well ahead with 43.73% against 31.36% for Michèle Delaunay. In the second round, it was finally Michèle Delaunay who won the election with 50.93% of the votes against 49.07% for Alain Juppé, the margin being only 670 votes. The defeat of the so-called constituency &quot;Mayor&quot; showed that Bordeaux was rocking increasingly left. Finally, in the third constituency of the Gironde, Noël Mamère was well ahead with 39.82% against 28.42% for the UMP candidate Elizabeth Vine. In the second round, Noël Mamère was re-elected with 62.82% against 37.18% for his right-wing rival.

==== Municipal elections of 2008 ====
In 2008 municipal elections saw the clash between mayor of Bordeaux, Alain Juppé and the President of the Regional Council of Aquitaine Socialist Alain Rousset. The PS had put up a Socialist heavyweight in the Gironde and had put great hopes in this election after the victory of Ségolène Royal and Michèle Delaunay in 2007. However, after a rather exciting campaign it was Alain Juppé who was widely elected in the first round with 56.62 percent, far ahead of Alain Rousset who garnered 34.14 percent of the vote. At present, of the eight cantons that has Bordeaux, five are held by the PS and three by the UMP, the left eating a little each time into the right&#x27;s numbers.

==== European elections of 2009 ====
In the European elections of 2009, Bordeaux voters largely voted for the UMP candidate Dominique Baudis, who won 31.54% against 15.00% for PS candidate Kader Arif. The candidate of Europe Ecology José Bové came second with 22.34%. None of the other candidates reached the 10% mark. The 2009 European elections were like the previous ones in eight constituencies. Bordeaux is located in the district &quot;Southwest&quot;, here are the results:

UMP candidate Dominique Baudis: 26.89%. His party gained four seats. PS candidate Kader Arif: 17.79%, gaining two seats in the European Parliament. Europe Ecology candidate Bove: 15.83%, obtaining two seats. MoDem candidate Robert Rochefort: 8.61%, winning a seat. Left Front candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon: 8.16%, gaining the last seat. At regional elections in 2010, the Socialist incumbent president Alain Rousset won the first round by totaling 35.19% in Bordeaux, but this score was lower than the plan for Gironde and Aquitaine. Xavier Darcos, Minister of Labour followed with 28.40% of the votes, scoring above the regional and departmental average. Then came Monique De Marco, Green candidate with 13.40%, followed by the member of Pyrenees-Atlantiques and candidate of the MoDem Jean Lassalle who registered a low 6.78% while qualifying to the second round on the whole Aquitaine, closely followed by Jacques Colombier, candidate of the National Front, who gained 6.48%. Finally the candidate of the Left Front Gérard Boulanger with 5.64%, no other candidate above the 5% mark. In the second round, Alain Rousset had a tidal wave win as national totals rose to 55.83%. If Xavier Darcos largely lost the election, he nevertheless achieved a score above the regional and departmental average obtaining 33.40%. Jean Lassalle, who qualified for the second round, passed the 10% mark by totaling 10.77%. The ballot was marked by abstention amounting to 55.51% in the first round and 53.59% in the second round.

== Education ==

=== University ===

During Antiquity, a first university had been created by the Romans in 286. The city was an important administrative centre and the new university had to train administrators. Only rhetoric and grammar were taught. Ausonius and Sulpicius Severus were two of the teachers.

In 1441, when Bordeaux was an English town, the Pope Eugene IV created a university by demand of the archbishop Pey Berland. In 1793, during the French Revolution, the National Convention abolished the university, and replace them with the École centrale in 1796. In Bordeaux, this one was located in the former buildings of the college of Guyenne. In 1808, the university reappeared with Napoleon. Bordeaux accommodates approximately 70,000 students on one of the largest campuses of Europe (235 ha).

Bordeaux is home to one of Europe&#x27;s biggest 18th-century architectural urban areas, making it a sought-after destination for tourists and cinema production crews. It stands out as one of the first French cities, after Nancy, to have entered an era of urbanism and metropolitan big scale projects, with the team Gabriel father and son, architects for King Louis XV, under the supervision of two intendants (Governors), first Nicolas-François Dupré de Saint-Maur then the Marquis de Tourny.

=== Slavery memorials ===
Slavery was part of a growing drive for the city. During the 18th and 19th centuries, Bordeaux was an important slave port, which saw some 500 slave expeditions that cause the deportation of 150,000 Africans by Bordeaux shipowners. Secondly, even though the &quot;Triangular trade&quot; represented only 5% of Bordeaux&#x27;s wealth, the city&#x27;s direct trade with the Caribbean, that accounted for the other 95%, concerns the colonial stuffs made by the slave (sugar, coffee, cocoa). And thirdly, in that same period, a major migratory movement by Aquitanians took place to the Caribbean colonies, with Saint-Domingue (now Haiti) being the most popular destination. 40% of the white population of the island came from Aquitaine. They prospered with plantations incomes, until the first slave revolts which concluded in 1848 in the final abolition of slavery in France.

A statue of Modeste Testas, an Ethiopian woman who was enslaved by the Bordeaux-based Testas brothers was unveiled in 2019. She was trafficked by them from West Africa, to Philadelphia (where one of the brothers coerced her to have two children by him) and was ultimately freed and lived in Haiti. The bronze sculpture was created by the Haitian artists Woodly Caymitte.

A number of traces and memorial sites are visible in the city. Moreover, in May 2009, the Museum of Aquitaine opened the spaces dedicated to &quot;Bordeaux in the 18th century, trans-Atlantic trading and slavery&quot;. This work, richly illustrated with original documents, contributes to disseminate the state of knowledge on this question, presenting above all the facts and their chronology.

The region of Bordeaux was also the land of several prominent abolitionists, as Montesquieu, Laffon de Ladébat and Elisée Reclus. Others were members of the Society of the Friends of the Blacks as the revolutionaries Boyer-Fonfrède, Gensonné, Guadet and Ducos.
=== Parks and gardens ===

=== Pont Jacques Chaban-Delmas ===

Europe&#x27;s longest-span vertical-lift bridge, the Pont Jacques Chaban-Delmas, was opened in 2013 in Bordeaux, spanning the River Garonne. The central lift span is , weighs 4,600 tons and can be lifted vertically up to to let tall ships pass underneath. The €160 million bridge was inaugurated by President François Hollande and Mayor Alain Juppé on 16 March 2013. The bridge was named after the late Jacques Chaban-Delmas, who was a former Prime Minister and Mayor of Bordeaux.

=== Shopping ===

Bordeaux has many shopping options. In the heart of Bordeaux is Rue Sainte-Catherine. This pedestrianised street has of shops, restaurants and cafés; it is also one of the longest shopping streets in Europe. Rue Sainte-Catherine starts at Place de la Victoire and ends at Place de la Comédie by the Grand Théâtre. The shops become progressively more upmarket as one moves towards Place de la Comédie and the nearby Cours de l&#x27;Intendance is where there are the more exclusive shops and boutiques.

== Culture ==
Bordeaux is the first city in France to have created, in the 1980s, an architecture exhibition and research centre, &quot;Arc en rêve&quot;. 

The city has a large number of cinemas, theatres, and is the home of the Opéra national de Bordeaux. There are many music venues of varying capacity. The city also offers several festivals throughout the year. 

The Bordeaux International Festival of Women in Cinema (Festival international du cinéma au féminin de Bordeaux) took place in Bordeaux from 2002 until 2005. The Festival international du film indépendant de Bordeaux (Fifib or FIFIB), or Bordeaux International Independent Film Festival, was established in 2012. 
== Transport ==
=== Road ===
Bordeaux is an important road and motorway junction. The city is connected to Paris by the A10 motorway, with Lyon by the A89, with Toulouse by the A62, and with Spain by the A63. There is a ring road called the &quot;Rocade&quot; which is often very busy. Another ring road is under consideration.

Bordeaux has five road bridges that cross the Garonne, the Pont de pierre built in the 1820s and three modern bridges built after 1960: the Pont Saint Jean, just south of the Pont de pierre (both located downtown), the Pont d&#x27;Aquitaine, a suspension bridge downstream from downtown, and the Pont François Mitterrand, located upstream of downtown. These two bridges are part of the ring-road around Bordeaux. A fifth bridge, the Pont Jacques-Chaban-Delmas, was constructed in 2009–2012 and opened to traffic in March 2013. Located halfway between the Pont de pierre and the Pont d&#x27;Aquitaine and serving downtown rather than highway traffic, it is a vertical-lift bridge with a height in closed position comparable to that of Pont de pierre, and to the Pont d&#x27;Aquitaine when open. All five road bridges, including the two highway bridges, are open to cyclists and pedestrians as well. Another bridge, the Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc, is to be built in 2018.

Lacking any steep hills, Bordeaux is relatively friendly to cyclists. Cycle paths (separate from the roadways) exist on the highway bridges, along the riverfront, on the university campuses, and incidentally elsewhere in the city. Cycle lanes and bus lanes that explicitly allow cyclists exist on many of the city&#x27;s boulevards. A paid bicycle-sharing system with automated stations was established in 2010.

=== Rail ===
The main railway station, Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean, near the center of the city, has 12 million passengers a year. It is served by the French national (SNCF) railway&#x27;s high speed train, the TGV, that gets to Paris in two hours, with connections to major European centers such as Lille, Brussels, Amsterdam, Cologne, Geneva and London. The TGV also serves Toulouse and Irun (Spain) from Bordeaux. A regular train service is provided to Nantes, Nice, Marseille and Lyon. The Gare Saint-Jean is the major hub for regional trains (TER) operated by the SNCF to Arcachon, Limoges, Agen, Périgueux, Langon, Pau, Le Médoc, Angoulême and Bayonne.

Historically the train line used to terminate at a station on the right bank of the river Garonne near the Pont de Pierre, and passengers crossed the bridge to get into the city. Subsequently, a double-track steel railway bridge was constructed in the 1850s, by Gustave Eiffel, to bring trains across the river direct into Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean. The old station was later converted and in 2010 comprised a cinema and restaurants.

The two-track Eiffel bridge with a speed limit of became a bottleneck and a new bridge was built, opening in 2009. The new bridge has four tracks and allows trains to pass at . During the planning there was much lobbying by the Eiffel family and other supporters to preserve the old bridge as a footbridge across the Garonne, with possibly a museum to document the history of the bridge and Gustave Eiffel&#x27;s contribution. The decision was taken to save the bridge, but by early 2010 no plans had been announced as to its future use. The bridge remains intact, but unused and without any means of access.

The LGV Sud Europe Atlantique became fully operational in July 2017, shortening the journey time from Bordeaux city to Paris to 2hrs 4mins.

=== Air ===
Bordeaux is served by Bordeaux–Mérignac Airport, located from the city centre in the suburban city of Mérignac.

=== Trams, buses and boats ===
Bordeaux has an important public transport system called Transports Bordeaux Métropole (TBM). This company is run by the Keolis group. The network consists of:
* Four tram lines (A, B, C and D)
* 75 bus routes, all connected to the tramway network (from 1 to 96)
* 13 night bus routes (from 1 to 16)
* An electric bus shuttle in the city centre
* A boat shuttle on the Garonne river

This network is operated from 5 am to 2 am.

There had been several plans for a subway network to be set up, but they stalled for both geological and financial reasons. Work on the Tramway de Bordeaux system was started in the autumn of 2000, and services started in December 2003 connecting Bordeaux with its suburban areas. The tram system uses Alstom APS a form of ground-level power supply technology developed by French company Alstom and designed to preserve the aesthetic environment by eliminating overhead cables in the historic city. Conventional overhead cables are used outside the city. The system was controversial for its considerable cost of installation, maintenance and also for the numerous initial technical problems that paralysed the network. Many streets and squares along the tramway route became pedestrian areas, with limited access for cars.

The Bordeaux Tramway system reached the Mérignac airport on April 29th 2023 with the opening of a 5-km extension of Line A.

=== Taxis ===
There are more than 400 taxicabs in Bordeaux.

=== Public transportation statistics ===
The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bordeaux, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 51 min. 12.% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 13 min, while 15.5% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is , while 8% travel for over in a single direction.

== Sport ==


The 41,458-capacity Nouveau Stade de Bordeaux is the largest stadium in Bordeaux. The stadium was opened in 2015 and replaced the Stade Chaban-Delmas, which was a venue for the FIFA World Cup in 1938 and 1998, as well as the 2007 Rugby World Cup. In the 1938 FIFA World Cup, it hosted a violent quarter-final known as the Battle of Bordeaux. The ground was formerly known as the &quot;Stade du Parc Lescure&quot; until 2001, when it was renamed in honour of the city&#x27;s long-time mayor, Jacques Chaban-Delmas.

There are two major sport teams in Bordeaux, Girondins de Bordeaux is the football team who, following administrative relegation, currently play in Championnat National 2, the fourth tier of French football. They are one of the most successful clubs in France, with six Division 1/Ligue 1 titles. Union Bordeaux Bègles is a rugby team in the Top 14 in the Ligue Nationale de Rugby. Skateboarding, rollerblading, and BMX biking are activities enjoyed by many young inhabitants of the city. Bordeaux is home to a quay which runs along the Garonne river. On the quay there is a skate-park divided into three sections. One section is for Vert tricks, one for street style tricks, and one for little action sports athletes with easier features and softer materials. The skate-park is very well maintained by the municipality.

Other sports clubs include top flight ice hockey team Boxers de Bordeaux and third-tier basketball team JSA Bordeaux Basket

Bordeaux is also the home to one of the strongest cricket teams in France and are champions of the South West League.

There is a wooden velodrome, Vélodrome du Lac, in Bordeaux which hosts international cycling competition in the form of UCI Track Cycling World Cup events.

The 2015 Trophee Eric Bompard was in Bordeaux. But the Free Skate was cancelled in all of the divisions due to the Paris and aftermath. The Short Program occurred hours before the bombing. French skaters Chafik Besseghier (68.36) in tenth place, Romain Ponsart (62.86) in 11th. Mae-Berenice-Meite (46.82) in 11th and Laurine Lecavelier (46.53) in 12th. Vanessa James/Morgan Cipres (65.75) in second.

Between 1951 and 1955, an annual Formula 1 motor race was held on a 2.5-kilometre circuit which looped around the Esplanade des Quinconces and along the waterfront, attracting drivers such as Juan Manuel Fangio, Stirling Moss, Jean Behra and Maurice Trintignant.

<doc id="4098" wikidata="Q1197521" url="?curid=4098" title="Puzzle Bobble">
<text>internationally known as Bust-A-Move, is a 1994 tile-matching puzzle arcade game developed and published by Taito. It is based on the 1986 arcade game &quot;Bubble Bobble&quot;, featuring characters and themes from that game. Its characteristically cute Japanese animation and music, along with its play mechanics and level designs, made it successful as an arcade title and spawned several sequels and ports to home gaming systems.

==Gameplay==

At the start of each round, the rectangular playing arena contains a prearranged pattern of colored &quot;bubbles&quot;. At the bottom of the screen, the player controls a device called a &quot;pointer&quot;, which aims and fires bubbles up the screen. The color of bubbles fired is randomly generated and chosen from the colors of bubbles still left on the screen.

The objective of the game is to clear all the bubbles from the arena without any bubble crossing the bottom line. Bubbles will fire automatically if the player remains idle. After clearing the arena, the next round begins with a new pattern of bubbles to clear. The arcade version of the game consists of 30 levels. The fired bubbles travel in straight lines (possibly bouncing off the sidewalls of the arena), stopping when they touch other bubbles or reach the top of the arena. If a bubble touches identically colored bubbles, forming a group of three or more, those bubbles—as well as any bubbles hanging from them—are removed from the field of play, and points are awarded. After every few shots, the &quot;ceiling&quot; of the playing arena drops downwards slightly, along with all the bubbles stuck to it. The number of shots between each drop of the ceiling is influenced by the number of bubble colors remaining. The closer the bubbles get to the bottom of the screen, the faster the music plays and if they cross the line at the bottom then the game is over.

==Release==
Two different versions of the original game were released. &quot;Puzzle Bobble&quot; was originally released in Japan only in June 1994 by Taito, running on Taito B System hardware (with the preliminary title &quot;Bubble Buster&quot;). Then, six months later in December, the international Neo Geo version of &quot;Puzzle Bobble&quot; was released. It was almost identical aside from being in stereo and having some different sound effects and translated text.

==Reception==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed the Neo Geo version of &quot;Puzzle Bobble&quot; on their February 15, 1995 issue as being the second most-popular arcade game at the time. It went on to become Japan&#x27;s second highest-grossing arcade printed circuit board (PCB) software of 1995, below &quot;Virtua Fighter 2&quot;. In North America, &quot;RePlay&quot; reported the Neo Geo version of &quot;Puzzle Bobble&quot; to be the fourth most-popular arcade game in February 1995.

Reviewing the Super NES version, Mike Weigand of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; called it &quot;a thoroughly enjoyable and incredibly addicting puzzle game&quot;. He considered the two player mode the highlight, but also said that the one player mode provides a solid challenge. &quot;GamePro&quot; gave it a generally negative review, saying it starts out fun but that ultimately lacks intricacy and longevity. They elaborated that in one player mode all the levels feel the same, and that two player matches are over too quickly to build up any excitement. They also criticized the lack of any 3D effects in the graphics. &quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the SNES version of the game and called it &quot;addictive as hell&quot;.

A reviewer for &quot;Next Generation&quot;, while questioning the continued viability of the action puzzle genre, admitted that the game is &quot;very simple and &quot;very&quot; addictive&quot;. He remarked that though the 3DO version makes no significant additions, none are called for by a game with such simple enjoyment. &quot;GamePro&quot;″s brief review of the 3DO version commented that the game&#x27;s controls are responsive, and they also praised visuals and music. &quot;Edge&quot; magazine ranked the game 73rd on their 100 Best Video Games in 2007. &quot;IGN&quot; rated the SNES version 54th in its Top 100 SNES Games.

==Legacy==
The simplicity of the concept has led to many clones, both commercial and otherwise. 1996&#x27;s &quot;Snood&quot; replaced the bubbles with small creatures and has been successful in its own right. &quot;Worms Blast&quot; was Team 17&#x27;s take on the concept. On September 24, 2000, British game publisher Empire Interactive released a similar game, &quot;Spin Jam&quot;, for the original PlayStation console. Mobile clones include &quot;Bubble Witch Saga&quot; and &quot;Bubble Shooter&quot;. &quot;Frozen Bubble&quot; is a free software clone. For &quot;Bubble Bobble&quot;″s 35th anniversary, Taito launched &quot;Puzzle Bobble VR: Vacation Odyssey&quot; on the Oculus Quest and Oculus Quest 2, later coming to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 as &quot;Puzzle Bobble 3D: Vacation Odyssey&quot; in 2021.&quot;

=== &quot;Puzzle Bobble Everybubble!&quot; ===
&quot;Puzzle Bobble Everybubble!&quot; was released on May 23, 2023, for Nintendo Switch. The game also comes with an extra mode called &quot;&quot;Puzzle Bobble&quot; vs. &quot;Space Invaders&quot;&quot;, where up to four players can work together to erase bubble-encased invaders before they reach the player while only being able to aim straight up.

<doc id="4099" wikidata="Q265868" url="?curid=4099" title="Bone">
<text>A bone is a rigid organ that constitutes part of the skeleton in most vertebrate animals. Bones protect the various other organs of the body, produce red and white blood cells, store minerals, provide structure and support for the body, and enable mobility. Bones come in a variety of shapes and sizes and have complex internal and external structures. They are lightweight yet strong and hard and serve multiple functions.

Bone tissue (osseous tissue), which is also called bone in the uncountable sense of that word, is hard tissue, a type of specialised connective tissue. It has a honeycomb-like matrix internally, which helps to give the bone rigidity. Bone tissue is made up of different types of bone cells. Osteoblasts and osteocytes are involved in the formation and mineralisation of bone; osteoclasts are involved in the resorption of bone tissue. Modified (flattened) osteoblasts become the lining cells that form a protective layer on the bone surface. The mineralised matrix of bone tissue has an organic component of mainly collagen called &quot;ossein&quot; and an inorganic component of bone mineral made up of various salts. Bone tissue is mineralized tissue of two types, cortical bone and cancellous bone. Other types of tissue found in bones include bone marrow, endosteum, periosteum, nerves, blood vessels and cartilage.

In the human body at birth, approximately 300 bones are present. Many of these fuse together during development, leaving a total of 206 separate bones in the adult, not counting numerous small sesamoid bones. The largest bone in the body is the femur or thigh-bone, and the smallest is the &quot;stapes&quot; in the middle ear.

The Ancient Greek word for bone is ὀστέον (&quot;osteon&quot;), hence the many terms that use it as a prefix—such as osteopathy. In anatomical terminology, including the &quot;Terminologia Anatomica&quot; international standard, the word for a bone is &quot;&quot; (for example, &quot;os breve&quot;, &quot;os longum&quot;, &quot;os sesamoideum&quot;).

== Structure ==

Bone is not uniformly solid, but consists of a flexible matrix (about 30%) and bound minerals (about 70%), which are intricately woven and continuously remodeled by a group of specialized bone cells. Their unique composition and design allows bones to be relatively hard and strong, while remaining lightweight.

Bone matrix is 90 to 95% composed of elastic collagen fibers, also known as ossein, and the remainder is ground substance. The elasticity of collagen improves fracture resistance. The matrix is hardened by the binding of inorganic mineral salt, calcium phosphate, in a chemical arrangement known as bone mineral, a form of calcium apatite. It is the mineralization that gives bones rigidity.

Bone is actively constructed and remodeled throughout life by specialized bone cells known as osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Within any single bone, the tissue is woven into two main patterns: cortical and cancellous bone, each with a distinct appearance and characteristics.

===Cortex===
The hard outer layer of bones is composed of cortical bone, which is also called compact bone as it is much denser than cancellous bone. It forms the hard exterior (cortex) of bones. The cortical bone gives bone its smooth, white, and solid appearance, and accounts for 80% of the total bone mass of an adult human skeleton. It facilitates bone&#x27;s main functions—to support the whole body, to protect organs, to provide levers for movement, and to store and release chemical elements, mainly calcium. It consists of multiple microscopic columns, each called an osteon or Haversian system. Each column is multiple layers of osteoblasts and osteocytes around a central canal called the osteonic canal. Volkmann&#x27;s canals at right angles connect the osteons together. The columns are metabolically active, and as bone is reabsorbed and created the nature and location of the cells within the osteon will change. Cortical bone is covered by a periosteum on its outer surface, and an endosteum on its inner surface. The endosteum is the boundary between the cortical bone and the cancellous bone. The primary anatomical and functional unit of cortical bone is the osteon.

=== Trabeculae ===

Cancellous bone or spongy bone, also known as trabecular bone, is the internal tissue of the skeletal bone and is an open cell porous network that follows the material properties of biofoams. Cancellous bone has a higher surface-area-to-volume ratio than cortical bone and it is less dense. This makes it weaker and more flexible. The greater surface area also makes it suitable for metabolic activities such as the exchange of calcium ions. Cancellous bone is typically found at the ends of long bones, near joints, and in the interior of vertebrae. Cancellous bone is highly vascular and often contains red bone marrow where hematopoiesis, the production of blood cells, occurs. The primary anatomical and functional unit of cancellous bone is the trabecula. The trabeculae are aligned towards the mechanical load distribution that a bone experiences within long bones such as the femur. As far as short bones are concerned, trabecular alignment has been studied in the vertebral pedicle. Thin formations of osteoblasts covered in endosteum create an irregular network of spaces, known as trabeculae. Within these spaces are bone marrow and hematopoietic stem cells that give rise to platelets, red blood cells and white blood cells. Trabecular marrow is composed of a network of rod- and plate-like elements that make the overall organ lighter and allow room for blood vessels and marrow. Trabecular bone accounts for the remaining 20% of total bone mass but has nearly ten times the surface area of compact bone.

The words &quot;cancellous&quot; and &quot;trabecular&quot; refer to the tiny lattice-shaped units (trabeculae) that form the tissue. It was first illustrated accurately in the engravings of Crisóstomo Martinez.

===Marrow===
Bone marrow, also known as myeloid tissue in red bone marrow, can be found in almost any bone that holds cancellous tissue. In newborns, all such bones are filled exclusively with red marrow or hematopoietic marrow, but as the child ages the hematopoietic fraction decreases in quantity and the fatty/ yellow fraction called marrow adipose tissue (MAT) increases in quantity. In adults, red marrow is mostly found in the bone marrow of the femur, the ribs, the vertebrae and pelvic bones.

===Vascular supply===
Bone receives about 10% of cardiac output. Blood enters the endosteum, flows through the marrow, and exits through small vessels in the cortex. In humans, blood oxygen tension in bone marrow is about 6.6%, compared to about 12% in arterial blood, and 5% in venous and capillary blood.

===Cells===
Bone is metabolically active tissue composed of several types of cells. These cells include osteoblasts, which are involved in the creation and mineralization of bone tissue, osteocytes, and osteoclasts, which are involved in the reabsorption of bone tissue. Osteoblasts and osteocytes are derived from osteoprogenitor cells, but osteoclasts are derived from the same cells that differentiate to form macrophages and monocytes. Within the marrow of the bone there are also hematopoietic stem cells. These cells give rise to other cells, including white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets.

====Osteoblast====
Osteoblasts are mononucleate bone-forming cells. They are located on the surface of osteon seams and make a protein mixture known as osteoid, which mineralizes to become bone. The osteoid seam is a narrow region of a newly formed organic matrix, not yet mineralized, located on the surface of a bone. Osteoid is primarily composed of Type I collagen. Osteoblasts also manufacture hormones, such as prostaglandins, to act on the bone itself. The osteoblast creates and repairs new bone by actually building around itself. First, the osteoblast puts up collagen fibers. These collagen fibers are used as a framework for the osteoblasts&#x27; work. The osteoblast then deposits calcium phosphate which is hardened by hydroxide and bicarbonate ions. The brand-new bone created by the osteoblast is called osteoid. Once the osteoblast is finished working it is actually trapped inside the bone once it hardens. When the osteoblast becomes trapped, it becomes known as an osteocyte. Other osteoblasts remain on the top of the new bone and are used to protect the underlying bone, these become known as bone lining cells.

====Osteocyte====
Osteocytes are cells of mesenchymal origin and originate from osteoblasts that have migrated into and become trapped and surrounded by a bone matrix that they themselves produced. The spaces the cell body of osteocytes occupy within the mineralized collagen type I matrix are known as lacunae, while the osteocyte cell processes occupy channels called canaliculi. The many processes of osteocytes reach out to meet osteoblasts, osteoclasts, bone lining cells, and other osteocytes probably for the purposes of communication. Osteocytes remain in contact with other osteocytes in the bone through gap junctions—coupled cell processes which pass through the canalicular channels.

====Osteoclast====
Osteoclasts are very large multinucleate cells that are responsible for the breakdown of bones by the process of bone resorption. New bone is then formed by the osteoblasts. Bone is constantly remodeled by the resorption of osteoclasts and created by osteoblasts. Osteoclasts are large cells with multiple nuclei located on bone surfaces in what are called &quot;Howship&#x27;s lacunae&quot; (or &quot;resorption pits&quot;). These lacunae are the result of surrounding bone tissue that has been reabsorbed. Because the osteoclasts are derived from a monocyte stem-cell lineage, they are equipped with phagocytic-like mechanisms similar to circulating macrophages. Osteoclasts mature and/or migrate to discrete bone surfaces. Upon arrival, active enzymes, such as tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, are secreted against the mineral substrate. The reabsorption of bone by osteoclasts also plays a role in calcium homeostasis.

===Composition===
Bones consist of living cells (osteoblasts and osteocytes) embedded in a mineralized organic matrix. The primary inorganic component of human bone is hydroxyapatite, the dominant bone mineral, having the nominal composition of Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2. The organic components of this matrix consist mainly of type I collagen—&quot;organic&quot; referring to materials produced as a result of the human body—and inorganic components, which alongside the dominant hydroxyapatite phase, include other compounds of calcium and phosphate including salts. Approximately 30% of the acellular component of bone consists of organic matter, while roughly 70% by mass is attributed to the inorganic phase. The collagen fibers give bone its tensile strength, and the interspersed crystals of hydroxyapatite give bone its compressive strength. These effects are synergistic. The exact composition of the matrix may be subject to change over time due to nutrition and biomineralization, with the ratio of calcium to phosphate varying between 1.3 and 2.0 (per weight), and trace minerals such as magnesium, sodium, potassium and carbonate also be found.
Type I collagen composes 90–95% of the organic matrix, with the remainder of the matrix being a homogenous liquid called ground substance consisting of proteoglycans such as hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate, as well as non-collagenous proteins such as osteocalcin, osteopontin or bone sialoprotein. Collagen consists of strands of repeating units, which give bone tensile strength, and are arranged in an overlapping fashion that prevents shear stress. The function of ground substance is not fully known. Two types of bone can be identified microscopically according to the arrangement of collagen: woven and lamellar.

* Woven bone (also known as &quot;fibrous bone&quot;), which is characterized by a haphazard organization of collagen fibers and is mechanically weak.
* Lamellar bone, which has a regular parallel alignment of collagen into sheets (&quot;lamellae&quot;) and is mechanically strong.

Woven bone is produced when osteoblasts produce osteoid rapidly, which occurs initially in all fetal bones, but is later replaced by more resilient lamellar bone. In adults, woven bone is created after fractures or in Paget&#x27;s disease. Woven bone is weaker, with a smaller number of randomly oriented collagen fibers, but forms quickly; it is for this appearance of the fibrous matrix that the bone is termed &quot;woven&quot;. It is soon replaced by lamellar bone, which is highly organized in concentric sheets with a much lower proportion of osteocytes to surrounding tissue. Lamellar bone, which makes its first appearance in humans in the fetus during the third trimester, is stronger and filled with many collagen fibers parallel to other fibers in the same layer (these parallel columns are called osteons). In cross-section, the fibers run in opposite directions in alternating layers, much like in plywood, assisting in the bone&#x27;s ability to resist torsion forces. After a fracture, woven bone forms initially and is gradually replaced by lamellar bone during a process known as &quot;bony substitution&quot;. Compared to woven bone, lamellar bone formation takes place more slowly. The orderly deposition of collagen fibers restricts the formation of osteoid to about 1 to 2 μm per day. Lamellar bone also requires a relatively flat surface to lay the collagen fibers in parallel or concentric layers.

====Deposition====
The extracellular matrix of bone is laid down by osteoblasts, which secrete both collagen and ground substance. These cells synthesise collagen alpha polypetpide chains and then secrete collagen molecules. The collagen molecules associate with their neighbors and crosslink via lysyl oxidase to form collagen fibrils. At this stage, they are not yet mineralized, and this zone of unmineralized collagen fibrils is called &quot;osteoid&quot;. Around and inside collagen fibrils calcium and phosphate eventually precipitate within days to weeks becoming then fully mineralized bone with an overall carbonate substituted hydroxyapatite inorganic phase.

In order to mineralise the bone, the osteoblasts secrete alkaline phosphatase, some of which is carried by vesicles. This cleaves the inhibitory pyrophosphate and simultaneously generates free phosphate ions for mineralization, acting as the foci for calcium and phosphate deposition. Vesicles may initiate some of the early mineralization events by rupturing and acting as a centre for crystals to grow on. Bone mineral may be formed from globular and plate structures, and via initially amorphous phases.

==Types==

Five types of bones are found in the human body: long, short, flat, irregular, and sesamoid.
* Long bones are characterized by a shaft, the diaphysis, that is much longer than its width; and by an epiphysis, a rounded head at each end of the shaft. They are made up mostly of compact bone, with lesser amounts of marrow, located within the medullary cavity, and areas of spongy, cancellous bone at the ends of the bones. Most bones of the limbs, including those of the fingers and toes, are long bones. The exceptions are the eight carpal bones of the wrist, the seven articulating tarsal bones of the ankle and the sesamoid bone of the kneecap. Long bones such as the clavicle, that have a differently shaped shaft or ends are also called &quot;modified long bones&quot;.
* Short bones are roughly cube-shaped, and have only a thin layer of compact bone surrounding a spongy interior. Short bones provide stability and support as well as some limited motion. The bones of the wrist and ankle are short bones.
* Flat bones are thin and generally curved, with two parallel layers of compact bone sandwiching a layer of spongy bone. Most of the bones of the skull are flat bones, as is the sternum.
* Sesamoid bones are bones embedded in tendons. Since they act to hold the tendon further away from the joint, the angle of the tendon is increased and thus the leverage of the muscle is increased. Examples of sesamoid bones are the patella and the pisiform.
* Irregular bones do not fit into the above categories. They consist of thin layers of compact bone surrounding a spongy interior. As implied by the name, their shapes are irregular and complicated. Often this irregular shape is due to their many centers of ossification or because they contain bony sinuses. The bones of the spine, pelvis, and some bones of the skull are irregular bones. Examples include the ethmoid and sphenoid bones.

==Terminology==

In the study of anatomy, anatomists use a number of anatomical terms to describe the appearance, shape and function of bones. Other anatomical terms are also used to describe the location of bones. Like other anatomical terms, many of these derive from Latin and Greek. Some anatomists still use Latin to refer to bones. The term &quot;osseous&quot;, and the prefix &quot;osteo-&quot;, referring to things related to bone, are still used commonly today.

Some examples of terms used to describe bones include the term &quot;foramen&quot; to describe a hole through which something passes, and a &quot;canal&quot; or &quot;meatus&quot; to describe a tunnel-like structure. A protrusion from a bone can be called a number of terms, including a &quot;condyle&quot;, &quot;crest&quot;, &quot;spine&quot;, &quot;eminence&quot;, &quot;tubercle&quot; or &quot;tuberosity&quot;, depending on the protrusion&#x27;s shape and location. In general, long bones are said to have a &quot;head&quot;, &quot;neck&quot;, and &quot;body&quot;.

When two bones join, they are said to &quot;articulate&quot;. If the two bones have a fibrous connection and are relatively immobile, then the joint is called a &quot;suture&quot;.

==Development==
The formation of bone is called ossification. During the fetal stage of development this occurs by two processes: intramembranous ossification and endochondral ossification. Intramembranous ossification involves the formation of bone from connective tissue whereas endochondral ossification involves the formation of bone from cartilage.

Intramembranous ossification mainly occurs during formation of the flat bones of the skull but also the mandible, maxilla, and clavicles; the bone is formed from connective tissue such as mesenchyme tissue rather than from cartilage. The process includes: the development of the ossification center, calcification, trabeculae formation and the development of the periosteum.

Endochondral ossification occurs in long bones and most other bones in the body; it involves the development of bone from cartilage. This process includes the development of a cartilage model, its growth and development, development of the primary and secondary ossification centers, and the formation of articular cartilage and the epiphyseal plates.

Endochondral ossification begins with points in the cartilage called &quot;primary ossification centers&quot;. They mostly appear during fetal development, though a few short bones begin their primary ossification after birth. They are responsible for the formation of the diaphyses of long bones, short bones and certain parts of irregular bones. Secondary ossification occurs after birth and forms the epiphyses of long bones and the extremities of irregular and flat bones. The diaphysis and both epiphyses of a long bone are separated by a growing zone of cartilage (the epiphyseal plate). At skeletal maturity (18 to 25 years of age), all of the cartilage is replaced by bone, fusing the diaphysis and both epiphyses together (epiphyseal closure). In the upper limbs, only the diaphyses of the long bones and scapula are ossified. The epiphyses, carpal bones, coracoid process, medial border of the scapula, and acromion are still cartilaginous.

The following steps are followed in the conversion of cartilage to bone:
# Zone of reserve cartilage. This region, farthest from the marrow cavity, consists of typical hyaline cartilage that as yet shows no sign of transforming into bone.
# Zone of cell proliferation. A little closer to the marrow cavity, chondrocytes multiply and arrange themselves into longitudinal columns of flattened lacunae.
# Zone of cell hypertrophy. Next, the chondrocytes cease to divide and begin to hypertrophy (enlarge), much like they do in the primary ossification center of the fetus. The walls of the matrix between lacunae become very thin.
# Zone of calcification. Minerals are deposited in the matrix between the columns of lacunae and calcify the cartilage. These are not the permanent mineral deposits of bone, but only a temporary support for the cartilage that would otherwise soon be weakened by the breakdown of the enlarged lacunae.
# Zone of bone deposition. Within each column, the walls between the lacunae break down and the chondrocytes die. This converts each column into a longitudinal channel, which is immediately invaded by blood vessels and marrow from the marrow cavity. Osteoblasts line up along the walls of these channels and begin depositing concentric lamellae of matrix, while osteoclasts dissolve the temporarily calcified cartilage.
Bone development in youth is extremely important in preventing future complications of the skeletal system. Regular exercise during childhood and adolescence can help improve bone architecture, making bones more resilient and less prone to fractures in adulthood. Physical activity, specifically resistance training, stimulates growth of bones by increasing both bone density and strength. Studies have shown a positive correlation between the adaptations of resistance training and bone density. While nutritional and pharmacological approaches may also improve bone health, the strength and balance adaptations from resistance training are a substantial added benefit. Weight-bearing exercise may assist in osteoblast (bone-forming cells) formation and help to increase bone mineral content. High-impact sports, which involve quick changes in direction, jumping, and running, are particularly effective with stimulating bone growth in the youth. Sports such as soccer, basketball, and tennis have shown to have positive effects on bone mineral density as well as bone mineral content in teenagers. Engaging in physical activity during childhood years, particularly in these high-impact osteogenic sports, can help to positively influence bone mineral density in adulthood. Children and adolescents who participate in regular physical activity will place the groundwork for bone health later in life, reducing the risk of bone-related conditions such as osteoporosis.

==Functions==

Bones have a variety of functions:

===Mechanical===

Bones serve a variety of mechanical functions. Together the bones in the body form the skeleton. They provide a frame to keep the body supported, and an attachment point for skeletal muscles, tendons, ligaments and joints, which function together to generate and transfer forces so that individual body parts or the whole body can be manipulated in three-dimensional space (the interaction between bone and muscle is studied in biomechanics).

Bones protect internal organs, such as the skull protecting the brain or the ribs protecting the heart and lungs. Because of the way that bone is formed, bone has a high compressive strength of about , poor tensile strength of 104–121 MPa, and a very low shear stress strength (51.6 MPa). This means that bone resists pushing (compressional) stress well, resist pulling (tensional) stress less well, but only poorly resists shear stress (such as due to torsional loads). While bone is essentially brittle, bone does have a significant degree of elasticity, contributed chiefly by collagen.

Mechanically, bones also have a special role in hearing. The ossicles are three small bones in the middle ear which are involved in sound transduction.

===Synthetic===
The cancellous part of bones contain bone marrow. Bone marrow produces blood cells in a process called hematopoiesis. Blood cells that are created in bone marrow include red blood cells, platelets and white blood cells. Progenitor cells such as the hematopoietic stem cell divide in a process called mitosis to produce precursor cells. These include precursors which eventually give rise to white blood cells, and erythroblasts which give rise to red blood cells. Unlike red and white blood cells, created by mitosis, platelets are shed from very large cells called megakaryocytes. This process of progressive differentiation occurs within the bone marrow. After the cells are matured, they enter the circulation. Every day, over 2.5 billion red blood cells and platelets, and 50–100 billion granulocytes are produced in this way.

As well as creating cells, bone marrow is also one of the major sites where defective or aged red blood cells are destroyed.

===Metabolic===
* Mineral storage – bones act as reserves of minerals important for the body, most notably calcium and phosphorus.

Determined by the species, age, and the type of bone, bone cells make up to 15 percent of the bone. Growth factor storage—mineralized bone matrix stores important growth factors such as insulin-like growth factors, transforming growth factor, bone morphogenetic proteins and others.
* Fat storage – marrow adipose tissue (MAT) acts as a storage reserve of fatty acids.
* Acid-base balance – bone buffers the blood against excessive pH changes by absorbing or releasing alkaline salts.
* Detoxification – bone tissues can also store heavy metals and other foreign elements, removing them from the blood and reducing their effects on other tissues. These can later be gradually released for excretion.
* Endocrine organ – bone controls phosphate metabolism by releasing fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), which acts on kidneys to reduce phosphate reabsorption. Bone cells also release a hormone called osteocalcin, which contributes to the regulation of blood sugar (glucose) and fat deposition. Osteocalcin increases both the insulin secretion and sensitivity, in addition to boosting the number of insulin-producing cells and reducing stores of fat.
* Calcium balance – the process of bone resorption by the osteoclasts releases stored calcium into the systemic circulation and is an important process in regulating calcium balance. As bone formation actively &quot;fixes&quot; circulating calcium in its mineral form, removing it from the bloodstream, resorption actively &quot;unfixes&quot; it thereby increasing circulating calcium levels. These processes occur in tandem at site-specific locations.

==== Calcium ====
Strong bones during our youth is essential for preventing osteoporosis and bone fragility as we age. The importance of insuring factors that could influence increases in BMD while lowering our risks for further bone degradation is necessary during our childhood as these factors lead to a supportive and healthy lifestyle/bone health. Up till the age of 30, the bone stores that we have will ultimately start to decrease as we surpass this age. Influencing factors that can help us have larger stores and higher amounts of BMD will allow us to see less harmful results as we reach older adulthood.

The issue of having fragile bones during our childhood leads to an increase in certain disorders and conditions such as juvenile osteoporosis, though it is less common to see, the necessity for a healthy routine especially when it comes to bone development is essential in our youth. Children that naturally have lower bone mineral density have a lower quality of life and therefore lead a life that is less fulfilling and uncomfortable. Factors such as increases in Calcium intake has been shown to increase BMD stores. Studies have shown that increasing calcium stores whether that be through supplementation or intake via foods and beverages such as leafy greens and milk have pushed the notion that prepuberty or even early pubertal children will see increases in BMD with the addition of increase Calcium intake.

Another research study goes on to show that long-term calcium intake has been proven to significantly contribute to overall BMD in children without certain conditions or disorders. This data shows that ensuring adequate calcium intake in children reinforces the structure and rate at which bones will begin to densify. Further detailing how structuring a strong nutritional plan with adequate amounts of Calcium sources can lead to strong bones but also can be a worth-while strategy into preventing further damage or degradation of bone stores as we age.

The connection between Calcium intake &amp; BMD and its effects on youth as a whole is a very world-wide issue and has been shown to affect different ethnicities in a variety of differing ways. In a recent study, there was a strong correlation between calcium intake and BMD across a variety of diverse populations of children and adolescence ultimately coming to the conclusion that fundamentally, achieving optimal bone health is necessary for providing our youth with the ability to undergo hormonal changes as well. They found in a study of over 10,000 children ages 8–19 that in females, African Americans, and the 12-15 adolescent groups that at 2.6-2.8g/kg of body weight, they began to see a decrease in BMD. They elaborate on this by determining that this is strongly influenced by a lower baseline in calcium intake throughout puberty. Genetic factors have also been shown to influence lower acceptance of calcium stores.

Ultimately, the window that youth have for accruing and building resilient bones is very minimal. Being able to consistently meet calcium needs while also engaging in weight-bearing exercise is essential for building a strong initial bone foundation at which to build upon. Being able to reach our daily value of 1300 mg for ages 9–18 is becoming more and more necessary and as we progress in health, the chance that osteoporosis and other factors such as bone fragility or potential for stunted growth can be greatly reduced through these resources, ultimately leading to a more fulfilling and healthier lifestyle.

==Remodeling==

Bone is constantly being created and replaced in a process known as remodeling. This ongoing turnover of bone is a process of resorption followed by replacement of bone with little change in shape. This is accomplished through osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Cells are stimulated by a variety of signals, and together referred to as a remodeling unit. Approximately 10% of the skeletal mass of an adult is remodelled each year. The purpose of remodeling is to regulate calcium homeostasis, repair microdamaged bones from everyday stress, and to shape the skeleton during growth. Repeated stress, such as weight-bearing exercise or bone healing, results in the bone thickening at the points of maximum stress (Wolff&#x27;s law). It has been hypothesized that this is a result of bone&#x27;s piezoelectric properties, which cause bone to generate small electrical potentials under stress.

The action of osteoblasts and osteoclasts are controlled by a number of chemical enzymes that either promote or inhibit the activity of the bone remodeling cells, controlling the rate at which bone is made, destroyed, or changed in shape. The cells also use paracrine signalling to control the activity of each other. For example, the rate at which osteoclasts resorb bone is inhibited by calcitonin and osteoprotegerin. Calcitonin is produced by parafollicular cells in the thyroid gland, and can bind to receptors on osteoclasts to directly inhibit osteoclast activity. Osteoprotegerin is secreted by osteoblasts and is able to bind RANK-L, inhibiting osteoclast stimulation.

Osteoblasts can also be stimulated to increase bone mass through increased secretion of osteoid and by inhibiting the ability of osteoclasts to break down osseous tissue. Increased secretion of osteoid is stimulated by the secretion of growth hormone by the pituitary, thyroid hormone and the sex hormones (estrogens and androgens). These hormones also promote increased secretion of osteoprotegerin. Osteoblasts can also be induced to secrete a number of cytokines that promote reabsorption of bone by stimulating osteoclast activity and differentiation from progenitor cells. Vitamin D, parathyroid hormone and stimulation from osteocytes induce osteoblasts to increase secretion of RANK-ligand and interleukin 6, which cytokines then stimulate increased reabsorption of bone by osteoclasts. These same compounds also increase secretion of macrophage colony-stimulating factor by osteoblasts, which promotes the differentiation of progenitor cells into osteoclasts, and decrease secretion of osteoprotegerin.

==Volume==
Bone volume is determined by the rates of bone formation and bone resorption. Certain growth factors may work to locally alter bone formation by increasing osteoblast activity. Numerous bone-derived growth factors have been isolated and classified via bone cultures. These factors include insulin-like growth factors I and II, transforming growth factor-beta, fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and bone morphogenetic proteins. Evidence suggests that bone cells produce growth factors for extracellular storage in the bone matrix. The release of these growth factors from the bone matrix could cause the proliferation of osteoblast precursors. Essentially, bone growth factors may act as potential determinants of local bone formation. Cancellous bone volume in postmenopausal osteoporosis may be determined by the relationship between the total bone forming surface and the percent of surface resorption.

==Clinical significance==

A number of diseases can affect bone, including arthritis, fractures, infections, osteoporosis and tumors. Conditions relating to bone can be managed by a variety of doctors, including rheumatologists for joints, and orthopedic surgeons, who may conduct surgery to fix broken bones. Other doctors, such as rehabilitation specialists may be involved in recovery, radiologists in interpreting the findings on imaging, and pathologists in investigating the cause of the disease, and family doctors may play a role in preventing complications of bone disease such as osteoporosis.

When a doctor sees a patient, a history and exam will be taken. Bones are then often imaged, called radiography. This might include ultrasound X-ray, CT scan, MRI scan and other imaging such as a Bone scan, which may be used to investigate cancer. Other tests such as a blood test for autoimmune markers may be taken, or a synovial fluid aspirate may be taken.

===Fractures===
In normal bone, fractures occur when there is significant force applied or repetitive trauma over a long time. Fractures can also occur when a bone is weakened, such as with osteoporosis, or when there is a structural problem, such as when the bone remodels excessively (such as Paget&#x27;s disease) or is the site of the growth of cancer. Common fractures include wrist fractures and hip fractures, associated with osteoporosis, vertebral fractures associated with high-energy trauma and cancer, and fractures of long-bones. Not all fractures are painful. When serious, depending on the fractures type and location, complications may include flail chest, compartment syndromes or fat embolism.
Compound fractures involve the bone&#x27;s penetration through the skin. Some complex fractures can be treated by the use of bone grafting procedures that replace missing bone portions.

Fractures and their underlying causes can be investigated by X-rays, CT scans and MRIs. Fractures are described by their location and shape, and several classification systems exist, depending on the location of the fracture. A common long bone fracture in children is a Salter–Harris fracture. When fractures are managed, pain relief is often given, and the fractured area is often immobilised. This is to promote bone healing. In addition, surgical measures such as internal fixation may be used. Because of the immobilisation, people with fractures are often advised to undergo rehabilitation.

===Tumors===
Tumor that can affect bone in several ways. Examples of benign bone tumors include osteoma, osteoid osteoma, osteochondroma, osteoblastoma, enchondroma, giant-cell tumor of bone, and aneurysmal bone cyst.

===Cancer===

Cancer can arise in bone tissue, and bones are also a common site for other cancers to spread (metastasise) to. Cancers that arise in bone are called &quot;primary&quot; cancers, although such cancers are rare. Metastases within bone are &quot;secondary&quot; cancers, with the most common being breast cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, thyroid cancer, and kidney cancer. Secondary cancers that affect bone can either destroy bone (called a &quot;lytic&quot; cancer) or create bone (a &quot;sclerotic&quot; cancer). Cancers of the bone marrow inside the bone can also affect bone tissue, examples including leukemia and multiple myeloma. Bone may also be affected by cancers in other parts of the body. Cancers in other parts of the body may release parathyroid hormone or parathyroid hormone-related peptide. This increases bone reabsorption, and can lead to bone fractures.

Bone tissue that is destroyed or altered as a result of cancers is distorted, weakened, and more prone to fracture. This may lead to compression of the spinal cord, destruction of the marrow resulting in bruising, bleeding and immunosuppression, and is one cause of bone pain. If the cancer is metastatic, then there might be other symptoms depending on the site of the original cancer. Some bone cancers can also be felt.

Cancers of the bone are managed according to their type, their stage, prognosis, and what symptoms they cause. Many primary cancers of bone are treated with radiotherapy. Cancers of bone marrow may be treated with chemotherapy, and other forms of targeted therapy such as immunotherapy may be used. Palliative care, which focuses on maximising a person&#x27;s quality of life, may play a role in management, particularly if the likelihood of survival within five years is poor.

===Diabetes===

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which the body attacks the insulin-producing pancreas cells causing the body to not make enough insulin. In contrast type 2 diabetes in which the body creates enough Insulin, but becomes resistant to it over time.

Children makeup approximately 85% of Type 1 Diabetes cases and in America there was an average 22% rise in cases over the first 24 months of the COVID-19 Pandemic. With the increase of developing some form of diabetes across all ranges continually growing the health impacts on bone development and bone health in these populations are still being researched. Most evidence suggests that diabetes, either Type 1 and Type 2, inhibits osteoblastic activity and causes both lower BMD and BMC in both adults and children. The weakening of these developmental aspects is thought to lead to an increased risk of developing many diseases such as osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, osteopenia and fractures. Development of any of these diseases is thought to be correlated with a decrease in ability to perform in athletic environments and activities of daily living.

Focusing on therapies that target molecules like osteocalcin or AGEs could provide new ways to improve bone health and help manage the complications of diabetes more effectively.

===Other painful conditions===
* Osteomyelitis is inflammation of the bone or bone marrow due to bacterial infection.
* Osteomalacia is a painful softening of adult bone caused by severe vitamin D deficiency.
* Osteogenesis imperfecta
* Osteochondritis dissecans
* Ankylosing spondylitis
* Skeletal fluorosis is a bone disease caused by an excessive accumulation of fluoride in the bones. In advanced cases, skeletal fluorosis damages bones and joints and is painful.

===Osteoporosis===
Osteoporosis is a disease of bone where there is reduced bone mineral density, increasing the likelihood of fractures. Osteoporosis is defined in women by the World Health Organization as a bone mineral density of 2.5 standard deviations below peak bone mass, relative to the age and sex-matched average. This density is measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), with the term &quot;established osteoporosis&quot; including the presence of a fragility fracture. Osteoporosis is most common in women after menopause, when it is called &quot;postmenopausal osteoporosis&quot;, but may develop in men and premenopausal women in the presence of particular hormonal disorders and other chronic diseases or as a result of smoking and medications, specifically glucocorticoids. Osteoporosis usually has no symptoms until a fracture occurs. For this reason, DEXA scans are often done in people with one or more risk factors, who have developed osteoporosis and are at risk of fracture.

One of the most important risk factors for osteoporosis is advanced age. Accumulation of oxidative DNA damage in osteoblastic and osteoclastic cells appears to be a key factor in age-related osteoporosis.

Osteoporosis treatment includes advice to stop smoking, decrease alcohol consumption, exercise regularly, and have a healthy diet. Calcium and trace mineral supplements may also be advised, as may Vitamin D. When medication is used, it may include bisphosphonates, Strontium ranelate, and hormone replacement therapy.

===Osteopathic medicine===

Osteopathic medicine is a school of medical thought that links the musculoskeletal system to overall health. , over 77,000 physicians in the United States are trained in osteopathic medical schools.

== Bone health ==

Bone health is vastly important all throughout life due to a number of reasons, some of those being, without strong healthy bones we are more at risk for different chronic diseases, and fractures as well as day-to-day function being more difficult with poor bone health. Developing strong bones as a child is one of the most important steps to having healthy bones all throughout life because this is when a strong foundation is built, which will make it much easier to maintain musculoskeletal health in later years. Adolescence offers a window to really develop bones in either a positive or negative way. It is estimated that diet and exercise during these years can impact peak bone mass as an adult nearly 20-40%. One study done on children with developmental coordination disorder found an increase in bone mass up to 4% and 5% in the cortical areas of the tibia alone from a 13-week training period, which is truly significant when considering how participants only participated in the multimodal workouts twice per week, and it would be reasonable to expect these increases to be greater if workouts were more frequent, especially in youth without developmental coordination disorder. Peak bone mass occurs between the second and third decade of most people&#x27;s lives, and with this being the case if we can really stockpile as much bone mass and increase our BMD and BMC by living healthy active lives, and having good diets that consume adequate calcium and vitamin D then we will truly have a leg up in our later lives as well as actively decreasing risks of certain chronic diseases such as osteoporosis.

== Osteology ==

The study of bones and teeth is referred to as osteology. It is frequently used in anthropology, archeology and forensic science for a variety of tasks. This can include determining the nutritional, health, age or injury status of the individual the bones were taken from. Preparing fleshed bones for these types of studies can involve the process of maceration.

Typically anthropologists and archeologists study bone tools made by &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; and &quot;Homo neanderthalensis&quot;. Bones can serve a number of uses such as projectile points or artistic pigments, and can also be made from external bones such as antlers.
==Other animals==

Bird skeletons are very lightweight. Their bones are smaller and thinner, to aid flight. Among mammals, bats come closest to birds in terms of bone density, suggesting that small dense bones are a flight adaptation. Many bird bones have little marrow due to them being hollow.

A bird&#x27;s beak is primarily made of bone as projections of the mandibles which are covered in keratin.

Some bones, primarily formed separately in subcutaneous tissues, include headgears (such as bony core of horns, antlers, ossicones), osteoderm, and os penis/os clitoris. A deer&#x27;s antlers are composed of bone which is an unusual example of bone being outside the skin of the animal once the velvet is shed.

The extinct predatory fish &quot;Dunkleosteus&quot; had sharp edges of hard exposed bone along its jaws.

The proportion of cortical bone that is 80% in the human skeleton may be much lower in other animals, especially in marine mammals and marine turtles, or in various Mesozoic marine reptiles, such as ichthyosaurs, among others. This proportion can vary quickly in evolution; it often increases in early stages of returns to an aquatic lifestyle, as seen in early whales and pinnipeds, among others. It subsequently decreases in pelagic taxa, which typically acquire spongy bone, but aquatic taxa that live in shallow water can retain very thick, pachyostotic, osteosclerotic, or pachyosteosclerotic bones, especially if they move slowly, like sea cows. In some cases, even marine taxa that had acquired spongy bone can revert to thicker, compact bones if they become adapted to live in shallow water, or in hypersaline (denser) water.

Many animals, particularly herbivores, practice osteophagy—the eating of bones. This is presumably carried out in order to replenish lacking phosphate.

Many bone diseases that affect humans also affect other vertebrates—an example of one disorder is skeletal fluorosis.
==Society and culture==

Bones from slaughtered animals have a number of uses. In prehistoric times, they have been used for making bone tools. They have further been used in bone carving, already important in prehistoric art, and also in modern time as crafting materials for buttons, beads, handles, bobbins, calculation aids, head nuts, dice, poker chips, pick-up sticks, arrows, scrimshaw, ornaments, etc.

Bone glue can be made by prolonged boiling of ground or cracked bones, followed by filtering and evaporation to thicken the resulting fluid. Historically once important, bone glue and other animal glues today have only a few specialized uses, such as in antiques restoration. Essentially the same process, with further refinement, thickening and drying, is used to make gelatin.

Broth is made by simmering several ingredients for a long time, traditionally including bones.

Bone char, a porous, black, granular material primarily used for filtration and also as a black pigment, is produced by charring mammal bones.

Oracle bone script was a writing system used in ancient China based on inscriptions in bones. Its name originates from oracle bones, which were mainly ox clavicle. The Ancient Chinese (mainly in the Shang dynasty), would write their questions on the oracle bone, and burn the bone, and where the bone cracked would be the answer for the questions.

To point the bone at someone is considered bad luck in some cultures, such as Australian aborigines, such as by the Kurdaitcha.

The wishbones of fowl have been used for divination, and are still customarily used in a tradition to determine which one of two people pulling on either prong of the bone may make a wish.

Various cultures throughout history have adopted the custom of shaping an infant&#x27;s head by the practice of artificial cranial deformation. A widely practised custom in China was that of foot binding to limit the normal growth of the foot.

<doc id="4100" wikidata="Q864816" url="?curid=4100" title="Bretwalda">
<text>Bretwalda (also brytenwalda and bretenanwealda, sometimes capitalised) is an Old English word. The first record comes from the late 9th-century &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;. It is given to some of the rulers of Anglo-Saxon kingdoms from the 5th century onwards who had achieved overlordship of some or all of the other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. It is unclear whether the word dates back to the 5th century and was used by the kings themselves or whether it is a later, 9th-century, invention. The term &quot;bretwalda&quot; also appears in a 10th-century charter of Æthelstan. The literal meaning of the word is disputed and may translate to either &#x27;wide-ruler&#x27; or &#x27;Britain-ruler&#x27;.

The rulers of Mercia were generally the most powerful of the Anglo-Saxon kings from the mid 7th century to the early 9th century but are not accorded the title of &quot;bretwalda&quot; by the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, which had an anti-Mercian bias. The &quot;Annals of Wales&quot; continued to recognise the kings of Northumbria as &quot;Kings of the Saxons&quot; until the death of Osred I of Northumbria in 716.

==Etymology==
The first syllable of the term &quot;bretwalda&quot; may be related to &quot;Briton&quot; or &quot;Britain&quot;. The second element is taken to mean &#x27;ruler&#x27; or &#x27;sovereign&#x27;. Thus, one interpretation might be &#x27;sovereign of Britain&#x27;. Otherwise, the word may be a compound containing the Old English adjective &quot;brytten&quot; (&#x27;broad&#x27;, from the verb &quot;breotan&quot; meaning &#x27;to break&#x27; or &#x27;to disperse&#x27;), an element also found in the terms &quot;bryten rice&quot; (&#x27;kingdom&#x27;), &quot;bryten-grund&quot; (&#x27;the wide expanse of the earth&#x27;) and &quot;bryten cyning&quot; (&#x27;king whose authority was widely extended&#x27;). Though the origin is ambiguous, the draughtsman of the charter issued by Æthelstan used the term in a way that can only mean &#x27;wide-ruler&#x27;.

The latter etymology was first suggested by John Mitchell Kemble who alluded that &quot;of six manuscripts in which this passage occurs, one only reads &quot;Bretwalda&quot;: of the remaining five, four have &quot;Bryten-walda&quot; or &quot;-wealda&quot;, and one &quot;Breten-anweald&quot;, which is precisely synonymous with Brytenwealda&quot;; that Æthelstan was called &quot;brytenwealda ealles ðyses ealondes&quot;, which Kemble translates as &#x27;ruler of all these islands&#x27;; and that &quot;bryten-&quot; is a common prefix to words meaning &#x27;wide or general dispersion&#x27; and that the similarity to the word &quot;bretwealh&quot; (&#x27;Briton&#x27;) is &quot;merely accidental&quot;.

==Contemporary use==
The first recorded use of the term &quot;Bretwalda&quot; comes from a West Saxon chronicle of the late 9th century that applied the term to Ecgberht, who ruled Wessex from 802 to 839. The chronicler also wrote down the names of seven kings that Bede listed in his &quot;Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum&quot; in 731. All subsequent manuscripts of the &quot;Chronicle&quot; use the term &quot;Brytenwalda&quot;, which may have represented the original term or derived from a common error.

There is no evidence that the term was a title that had any practical use, with implications of formal rights, powers and office, or even that it had any existence before the 9th-century. Bede wrote in Latin and never used the term and his list of kings holding &quot;imperium&quot; should be treated with caution, not least in that he overlooks kings such as Penda of Mercia, who clearly held some kind of dominance during his reign. Similarly, in his list of bretwaldas, the West Saxon chronicler ignored such Mercian kings as Offa.

The use of the term &quot;Bretwalda&quot; was the attempt by a West Saxon chronicler to make some claim of West Saxon kings to the whole of Great Britain. The concept of the overlordship of the whole of Britain was at least recognised in the period, whatever was meant by the term. Quite possibly it was a survival of a Roman concept of &quot;Britain&quot;: it is significant that, while the hyperbolic inscriptions on coins and titles in charters often included the title &quot;rex Britanniae&quot;, when England was unified the title used was &quot;rex Angulsaxonum&quot;, (&#x27;king of the Anglo-Saxons&#x27;.)

==Modern interpretation by historians==
For some time, the existence of the word &quot;bretwalda&quot; in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, which was based in part on the list given by Bede in his &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot;, led historians to think that there was perhaps a &quot;title&quot; held by Anglo-Saxon overlords. This was particularly attractive as it would lay the foundations for the establishment of an English monarchy. The 20th-century historian Frank Stenton said of the Anglo-Saxon chronicler that &quot;his inaccuracy is more than compensated by his preservation of the English title applied to these outstanding kings&quot;. He argued that the term &quot;bretwalda&quot; &quot;falls into line with the other evidence which points to the Germanic origin of the earliest English institutions&quot;.

Over the later 20th century, this assumption was increasingly challenged. Patrick Wormald interpreted it as &quot;less an objectively realized office than a subjectively perceived status&quot; and emphasised the partiality of its usage in favour of Southumbrian rulers. In 1991, Steven Fanning argued that &quot;it is unlikely that the term ever existed as a title or was in common usage in Anglo-Saxon England&quot;. The fact that Bede never mentioned a special title for the kings in his list implies that he was unaware of one. In 1995, Simon Keynes observed that &quot;if Bede&#x27;s concept of the Southumbrian overlord, and the chronicler&#x27;s concept of the &#x27;Bretwalda&#x27;, are to be regarded as artificial constructs, which have no validity outside the context of the literary works in which they appear, we are released from the assumptions about political development which they seem to involve... we might ask whether kings in the eighth and ninth centuries were quite so obsessed with the establishment of a pan-Southumbrian state&quot;.

Modern interpretations view the concept of &quot;bretwalda&quot; overlordship as complex and an important indicator of how a 9th-century chronicler interpreted history and attempted to insert the increasingly powerful Saxon kings into that history.

==Overlordship==
A complex array of dominance and subservience existed during the Anglo-Saxon period. A king who used charters to grant land in another kingdom indicated such a relationship. If the other kingdom were fairly large, as when the Mercians dominated the East Anglians, the relationship would have been more equal than in the case of the Mercian dominance of the Hwicce, which was a comparatively small kingdom. Mercia was arguably the most powerful Anglo-Saxon kingdom for much of the late 7th though 8th centuries, though Mercian kings are missing from the two main &quot;lists&quot;. For Bede, Mercia was a traditional enemy of his native Northumbria and he regarded powerful kings such as the pagan Penda as standing in the way of the Christian conversion of the Anglo-Saxons. Bede omits them from his list, even though it is evident that Penda held a considerable degree of power. Similarly powerful Mercia kings such as Offa are missed out of the West Saxon &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, which sought to demonstrate the legitimacy of their kings to rule over other Anglo-Saxon peoples.

<doc id="4101" wikidata="Q1144897" url="?curid=4101" title="Brouwer fixed-point theorem">
<text>Brouwer&#x27;s fixed-point theorem is a fixed-point theorem in topology, named after L. E. J. (Bertus) Brouwer. It states that for any continuous function formula_1 mapping a nonempty compact convex set to itself, there is a point formula_2 such that formula_3. The simplest forms of Brouwer&#x27;s theorem are for continuous functions formula_1 from a closed interval formula_5 in the real numbers to itself or from a closed disk formula_6 to itself. A more general form than the latter is for continuous functions from a nonempty convex compact subset formula_7 of Euclidean space to itself.

Among hundreds of fixed-point theorems, Brouwer&#x27;s is particularly well known, due in part to its use across numerous fields of mathematics. In its original field, this result is one of the key theorems characterizing the topology of Euclidean spaces, along with the Jordan curve theorem, the hairy ball theorem, the invariance of dimension and the Borsuk–Ulam theorem. This gives it a place among the fundamental theorems of topology. The theorem is also used for proving deep results about differential equations and is covered in most introductory courses on differential geometry. It appears in unlikely fields such as game theory. In economics, Brouwer&#x27;s fixed-point theorem and its extension, the Kakutani fixed-point theorem, play a central role in the proof of existence of general equilibrium in market economies as developed in the 1950s by economics Nobel prize winners Kenneth Arrow and Gérard Debreu.

The theorem was first studied in view of work on differential equations by the French mathematicians around Henri Poincaré and Charles Émile Picard. Proving results such as the Poincaré–Bendixson theorem requires the use of topological methods. This work at the end of the 19th century opened into several successive versions of the theorem. The case of differentiable mappings of the -dimensional closed ball was first proved in 1910 by Jacques Hadamard and the general case for continuous mappings by Brouwer in 1911.

==Statement==
The theorem has several formulations, depending on the context in which it is used and its degree of generalization. The simplest is sometimes given as follows:

:;In the plane: Every continuous function from a closed disk to itself has at least one fixed point.

This can be generalized to an arbitrary finite dimension:

:;In Euclidean space:Every continuous function from a closed ball of a Euclidean space into itself has a fixed point.

A slightly more general version is as follows:

:;Convex compact set:Every continuous function from a nonempty convex compact subset &quot;K&quot; of a Euclidean space to &quot;K&quot; itself has a fixed point.

An even more general form is better known under a different name:

:;Schauder fixed point theorem:Every continuous function from a nonempty convex compact subset &quot;K&quot; of a Banach space to &quot;K&quot; itself has a fixed point.

==Importance of the pre-conditions==
The theorem holds only for functions that are &quot;endomorphisms&quot; (functions that have the same set as the domain and codomain) and for nonempty sets that are &quot;compact&quot; (thus, in particular, bounded and closed) and &quot;convex&quot; (or homeomorphic to convex). The following examples show why the pre-conditions are important.

===The function &quot;f&quot; as an endomorphism===
Consider the function
:formula_8
with domain [-1,1]. The range of the function is [0,2]. Thus, f is not an endomorphism.

===Boundedness===
Consider the function
:formula_9
which is a continuous function from formula_10 to itself. As it shifts every point to the right, it cannot have a fixed point. The space formula_10 is convex and closed, but not bounded.

===Closedness===
Consider the function
:formula_12
which is a continuous function from the open interval (−1,1) to itself. Since x = 1 is not part of the interval, there is not a fixed point of f(x) = x. The space (−1,1) is convex and bounded, but not closed. On the other hand, the function &quot;f&quot; have a fixed point for the closed interval [−1,1], namely &quot;f&quot;(1) = 1.

(The domain of f is (-1,1) but the range is (0,1), which are not the same. Earlier, one of the conditions for functions satisfying the theorem is that the domain and range were the same, not that one be a subset of the other. Thus the reason for f failing is not closure.)

===Convexity===
Convexity is not strictly necessary for Brouwer&#x27;s fixed-point theorem. Because the properties involved (continuity, being a fixed point) are invariant under homeomorphisms, Brouwer&#x27;s fixed-point theorem is equivalent to forms in which the domain is required to be a closed unit ball formula_13. For the same reason it holds for every set that is homeomorphic to a closed ball (and therefore also closed, bounded, connected, without holes, etc.).

The following example shows that Brouwer&#x27;s fixed-point theorem does not work for domains with holes. Consider the function formula_14, which is a continuous function from the unit circle to itself. Since &quot;-x≠x&quot; holds for any point of the unit circle, &quot;f&quot; has no fixed point. The analogous example works for the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional sphere (or any symmetric domain that does not contain the origin). The unit circle is closed and bounded, but it has a hole (and so it is not convex) . The function &quot;f&quot; have a fixed point for the unit disc, since it takes the origin to itself.

A formal generalization of Brouwer&#x27;s fixed-point theorem for &quot;hole-free&quot; domains can be derived from the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem.

===Notes===
The continuous function in this theorem is not required to be bijective or surjective.

==Illustrations==
The theorem has several &quot;real world&quot; illustrations. Here are some examples.

# Take two sheets of graph paper of equal size with coordinate systems on them, lay one flat on the table and crumple up (without ripping or tearing) the other one and place it, in any fashion, on top of the first so that the crumpled paper does not reach outside the flat one. There will then be at least one point of the crumpled sheet that lies directly above its corresponding point (i.e. the point with the same coordinates) of the flat sheet. This is a consequence of the &quot;n&quot; = 2 case of Brouwer&#x27;s theorem applied to the continuous map that assigns to the coordinates of every point of the crumpled sheet the coordinates of the point of the flat sheet immediately beneath it.
# Take an ordinary map of a country, and suppose that that map is laid out on a table inside that country. There will always be a &quot;You are Here&quot; point on the map which represents that same point in the country.
# In three dimensions a consequence of the Brouwer fixed-point theorem is that, no matter how much you stir a delicious cocktail in a glass (or think about milk shake), when the liquid has come to rest, some point in the liquid will end up in exactly the same place in the glass as before you took any action, assuming that the final position of each point is a continuous function of its original position, that the liquid after stirring is contained within the space originally taken up by it, and that the glass (and stirred surface shape) maintain a convex volume. Ordering a cocktail shaken, not stirred defeats the convexity condition (&quot;shaking&quot; being defined as a dynamic series of non-convex inertial containment states in the vacant headspace under a lid). In that case, the theorem would not apply, and thus all points of the liquid disposition are potentially displaced from the original state. 

==Intuitive approach==

===Explanations attributed to Brouwer===
The theorem is supposed to have originated from Brouwer&#x27;s observation of a cup of gourmet coffee.
If one stirs to dissolve a lump of sugar, it appears there is always a point without motion.
He drew the conclusion that at any moment, there is a point on the surface that is not moving.
The fixed point is not necessarily the point that seems to be motionless, since the centre of the turbulence moves a little bit.
The result is not intuitive, since the original fixed point may become mobile when another fixed point appears.

Brouwer is said to have added: &quot;I can formulate this splendid result different, I take a horizontal sheet, and another identical one which I crumple, flatten and place on the other. Then a point of the crumpled sheet is in the same place as on the other sheet.&quot;
Brouwer &quot;flattens&quot; his sheet as with a flat iron, without removing the folds and wrinkles. Unlike the coffee cup example, the crumpled paper example also demonstrates that more than one fixed point may exist. This distinguishes Brouwer&#x27;s result from other fixed-point theorems, such as Stefan Banach&#x27;s, that guarantee uniqueness.

===One-dimensional case===

In one dimension, the result is intuitive and easy to prove. The continuous function &quot;f&quot; is defined on a closed interval [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] and takes values in the same interval. Saying that this function has a fixed point amounts to saying that its graph (dark green in the figure on the right) intersects that of the function defined on the same interval [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] which maps &quot;x&quot; to &quot;x&quot; (light green).

Intuitively, any continuous line from the left edge of the square to the right edge must necessarily intersect the green diagonal. To prove this, consider the function &quot;g&quot; which maps &quot;x&quot; to &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) − &quot;x&quot;. It is ≥ 0 on &quot;a&quot; and ≤ 0 on &quot;b&quot;. By the intermediate value theorem, &quot;g&quot; has a zero in [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;]; this zero is a fixed point.

Brouwer is said to have expressed this as follows: &quot;Instead of examining a surface, we will prove the theorem about a piece of string. Let us begin with the string in an unfolded state, then refold it. Let us flatten the refolded string. Again a point of the string has not changed its position with respect to its original position on the unfolded string.&quot;

==History==
The Brouwer fixed point theorem was one of the early achievements of algebraic topology, and is the basis of more general fixed point theorems which are important in functional analysis. The case &quot;n&quot; = 3 first was proved by Piers Bohl in 1904 (published in &quot;Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik&quot;). It was later proved by L. E. J. Brouwer in 1909. Jacques Hadamard proved the general case in 1910, and Brouwer found a different proof in the same year. Since these early proofs were all non-constructive indirect proofs, they ran contrary to Brouwer&#x27;s intuitionist ideals. Although the existence of a fixed point is not constructive in the sense of constructivism in mathematics, methods to approximate fixed points guaranteed by Brouwer&#x27;s theorem are now known.

===Before discovery===
At the end of the 19th century, the old problem of the stability of the solar system returned into the focus of the mathematical community.
Its solution required new methods. As noted by Henri Poincaré, who worked on the three-body problem, there is no hope to find an exact solution: &quot;Nothing is more proper to give us an idea of the hardness of the three-body problem, and generally of all problems of Dynamics where there is no uniform integral and the Bohlin series diverge.&quot;
He also noted that the search for an approximate solution is no more efficient: &quot;the more we seek to obtain precise approximations, the more the result will diverge towards an increasing imprecision&quot;.

He studied a question analogous to that of the surface movement in a cup of coffee. What can we say, in general, about the trajectories on a surface animated by a constant flow? Poincaré discovered that the answer can be found in what we now call the topological properties in the area containing the trajectory. If this area is compact, i.e. both closed and bounded, then the trajectory either becomes stationary, or it approaches a limit cycle. Poincaré went further; if the area is of the same kind as a disk, as is the case for the cup of coffee, there must necessarily be a fixed point. This fixed point is invariant under all functions which associate to each point of the original surface its position after a short time interval &quot;t&quot;. If the area is a circular band, or if it is not closed, then this is not necessarily the case.

To understand differential equations better, a new branch of mathematics was born. Poincaré called it &quot;analysis situs&quot;. The French Encyclopædia Universalis defines it as the branch which &quot;treats the properties of an object that are invariant if it is deformed in any continuous way, without tearing&quot;. In 1886, Poincaré proved a result that is equivalent to Brouwer&#x27;s fixed-point theorem, although the connection with the subject of this article was not yet apparent. A little later, he developed one of the fundamental tools for better understanding the analysis situs, now known as the fundamental group or sometimes the Poincaré group. This method can be used for a very compact proof of the theorem under discussion.

Poincaré&#x27;s method was analogous to that of Émile Picard, a contemporary mathematician who generalized the Cauchy–Lipschitz theorem. Picard&#x27;s approach is based on a result that would later be formalised by another fixed-point theorem, named after Banach. Instead of the topological properties of the domain, this theorem uses the fact that the function in question is a contraction.

===First proofs===
At the dawn of the 20th century, the interest in analysis situs did not stay unnoticed. However, the necessity of a theorem equivalent to the one discussed in this article was not yet evident. Piers Bohl, a Latvian mathematician, applied topological methods to the study of differential equations. In 1904 he proved the three-dimensional case of our theorem, but his publication was not noticed.

It was Brouwer, finally, who gave the theorem its first patent of nobility. His goals were different from those of Poincaré. This mathematician was inspired by the foundations of mathematics, especially mathematical logic and topology. His initial interest lay in an attempt to solve Hilbert&#x27;s fifth problem. In 1909, during a voyage to Paris, he met Henri Poincaré, Jacques Hadamard, and Émile Borel. The ensuing discussions convinced Brouwer of the importance of a better understanding of Euclidean spaces, and were the origin of a fruitful exchange of letters with Hadamard. For the next four years, he concentrated on the proof of certain great theorems on this question. In 1912 he proved the hairy ball theorem for the two-dimensional sphere, as well as the fact that every continuous map from the two-dimensional ball to itself has a fixed point. These two results in themselves were not really new. As Hadamard observed, Poincaré had shown a theorem equivalent to the hairy ball theorem. The revolutionary aspect of Brouwer&#x27;s approach was his systematic use of recently developed tools such as homotopy, the underlying concept of the Poincaré group. In the following year, Hadamard generalised the theorem under discussion to an arbitrary finite dimension, but he employed different methods. Hans Freudenthal comments on the respective roles as follows: &quot;Compared to Brouwer&#x27;s revolutionary methods, those of Hadamard were very traditional, but Hadamard&#x27;s participation in the birth of Brouwer&#x27;s ideas resembles that of a midwife more than that of a mere spectator.&quot;

Brouwer&#x27;s approach yielded its fruits, and in 1910 he also found a proof that was valid for any finite dimension, as well as other key theorems such as the invariance of dimension. In the context of this work, Brouwer also generalized the Jordan curve theorem to arbitrary dimension and established the properties connected with the degree of a continuous mapping. This branch of mathematics, originally envisioned by Poincaré and developed by Brouwer, changed its name. In the 1930s, analysis situs became algebraic topology.

===Reception===

The theorem proved its worth in more than one way. During the 20th century numerous fixed-point theorems were developed, and even a branch of mathematics called fixed-point theory.
Brouwer&#x27;s theorem is probably the most important. It is also among the foundational theorems on the topology of topological manifolds and is often used to prove other important results such as the Jordan curve theorem.

Besides the fixed-point theorems for more or less contracting functions, there are many that have emerged directly or indirectly from the result under discussion. A continuous map from a closed ball of Euclidean space to its boundary cannot be the identity on the boundary. Similarly, the Borsuk–Ulam theorem says that a continuous map from the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional sphere to Rn has a pair of antipodal points that are mapped to the same point. In the finite-dimensional case, the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem provided from 1926 a method for counting fixed points. In 1930, Brouwer&#x27;s fixed-point theorem was generalized to Banach spaces. This generalization is known as Schauder&#x27;s fixed-point theorem, a result generalized further by S. Kakutani to set-valued functions. One also meets the theorem and its variants outside topology. It can be used to prove the Hartman-Grobman theorem, which describes the qualitative behaviour of certain differential equations near certain equilibria. Similarly, Brouwer&#x27;s theorem is used for the proof of the Central Limit Theorem. The theorem can also be found in existence proofs for the solutions of certain partial differential equations.

Other areas are also touched. In game theory, John Nash used the theorem to prove that in the game of Hex there is a winning strategy for white. In economics, P. Bich explains that certain generalizations of the theorem show that its use is helpful for certain classical problems in game theory and generally for equilibria (Hotelling&#x27;s law), financial equilibria and incomplete markets.

Brouwer&#x27;s celebrity is not exclusively due to his topological work. The proofs of his great topological theorems are not constructive, and Brouwer&#x27;s dissatisfaction with this is partly what led him to articulate the idea of constructivity. He became the originator and zealous defender of a way of formalising mathematics that is known as intuitionism, which at the time made a stand against set theory. Brouwer disavowed his original proof of the fixed-point theorem. 

==Proof outlines==

===A proof using degree===
Brouwer&#x27;s original 1911 proof relied on the notion of the degree of a continuous mapping, stemming from ideas in differential topology. Several modern accounts of the proof can be found in the literature, notably .

Let formula_15 denote the closed unit ball in formula_16 centered at the origin. Suppose for simplicity that formula_17 is continuously differentiable. A regular value of formula_1 is a point formula_19 such that the Jacobian of formula_1 is non-singular at every point of the preimage of formula_21. In particular, by the inverse function theorem, every point of the preimage of formula_1 lies in formula_23 (the interior of formula_24). The degree of formula_1 at a regular value formula_19 is defined as the sum of the signs of the Jacobian determinant of formula_1 over the preimages of formula_21 under formula_1:

:formula_30

The degree is, roughly speaking, the number of &quot;sheets&quot; of the preimage &quot;f&quot; lying over a small open set around &quot;p&quot;, with sheets counted oppositely if they are oppositely oriented. This is thus a generalization of winding number to higher dimensions.

The degree satisfies the property of &quot;homotopy invariance&quot;: let formula_1 and formula_32 be two continuously differentiable functions, and formula_33 for formula_34. Suppose that the point formula_21 is a regular value of formula_36 for all &quot;t&quot;. Then formula_37.

If there is no fixed point of the boundary of formula_24, then the function 
:formula_39

is well-defined, and

formula_40

defines a homotopy from the identity function to it. The identity function has degree one at every point. In particular, the identity function has degree one at the origin, so formula_32 also has degree one at the origin. As a consequence, the preimage formula_42 is not empty. The elements of formula_42 are precisely the fixed points of the original function &quot;f&quot;.

This requires some work to make fully general. The definition of degree must be extended to singular values of &quot;f&quot;, and then to continuous functions. The more modern advent of homology theory simplifies the construction of the degree, and so has become a standard proof in the literature.
=== A proof using the hairy ball theorem ===
The hairy ball theorem states that on the unit sphere in an odd-dimensional Euclidean space, there is no nowhere-vanishing continuous tangent vector field on . (The tangency condition means that = 0 for every unit vector .) Sometimes the theorem is expressed by the statement that &quot;there is always a place on the globe with no wind&quot;. An elementary proof of the hairy ball theorem can be found in . 

In fact, suppose first that is &quot;continuously differentiable&quot;. By scaling, it can be assumed that is a continuously differentiable unit tangent vector on . It can be extended radially to a small spherical shell of . For sufficiently small, a routine computation shows that the mapping () = + is a contraction mapping on and that the volume of its image is a polynomial in . On the other hand, as a contraction mapping, must restrict to a homeomorphism of onto (1 + ) and onto (1 + ) . This gives a contradiction, because, if the dimension of the Euclidean space is odd, (1 + )/2 is not a polynomial. 

If is only a &quot;continuous&quot; unit tangent vector on , by the Weierstrass approximation theorem, it can be uniformly approximated by a polynomial map of into Euclidean space. The orthogonal projection on to the tangent space is given by () = () - () ⋅ . Thus is polynomial and nowhere vanishing on ; by construction /|||| is a smooth unit tangent vector field on , a contradiction. 

The continuous version of the hairy ball theorem can now be used to prove the Brouwer fixed point theorem. First suppose that is even. If there were a fixed-point-free continuous self-mapping of the closed unit ball of the -dimensional Euclidean space , set

:formula_44

Since has no fixed points, it follows that, for in the interior of , the vector () is non-zero; and for in , the scalar product ⋅ () = 1 – ⋅ () is strictly positive. From the original -dimensional space Euclidean space , construct a new auxiliary ()-dimensional space = x R, with coordinates = (, ). Set

:formula_45

By construction is a continuous vector field on the unit sphere of , satisfying the tangency condition ⋅ () = 0. Moreover, () is nowhere vanishing (because, if has norm 1, then ⋅ () is non-zero; while if has norm strictly less than 1, then and () are both non-zero). This contradiction proves the fixed point theorem when is even. For odd, one can apply the fixed point theorem to the closed unit ball in dimensions and the mapping (,) = ((),0).
The advantage of this proof is that it uses only elementary techniques; more general results like the Borsuk-Ulam theorem require tools from algebraic topology.

===A proof using homology or cohomology===
The proof uses the observation that the boundary of the &quot;n&quot;-disk &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot; is &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1, the (&quot;n&quot; − 1)-sphere.
Suppose, for contradiction, that a continuous function has &quot;no&quot; fixed point. This means that, for every point x in &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot;, the points &quot;x&quot; and &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) are distinct. Because they are distinct, for every point x in &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot;, we can construct a unique ray from &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) to &quot;x&quot; and follow the ray until it intersects the boundary &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 (see illustration). By calling this intersection point &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), we define a function &quot;F&quot; : &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot; → &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 sending each point in the disk to its corresponding intersection point on the boundary. As a special case, whenever &quot;x&quot; itself is on the boundary, then the intersection point &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) must be &quot;x&quot;.

Consequently, &quot;F&quot; is a special type of continuous function known as a retraction: every point of the codomain (in this case &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1) is a fixed point of &quot;F&quot;.

Intuitively it seems unlikely that there could be a retraction of &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot; onto &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1, and in the case &quot;n&quot; = 1, the impossibility is more basic, because &quot;S&quot;0 (i.e., the endpoints of the closed interval &quot;D&quot;1) is not even connected. The case &quot;n&quot; = 2 is less obvious, but can be proven by using basic arguments involving the fundamental groups of the respective spaces: the retraction would induce a surjective group homomorphism from the fundamental group of &quot;D&quot;2 to that of &quot;S&quot;1, but the latter group is isomorphic to Z while the first group is trivial, so this is impossible. The case &quot;n&quot; = 2 can also be proven by contradiction based on a theorem about non-vanishing vector fields.

For &quot;n&quot; &gt; 2, however, proving the impossibility of the retraction is more difficult. One way is to make use of homology groups: the homology &quot;H&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1(&quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot;) is trivial, while &quot;H&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1(&quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1) is infinite cyclic. This shows that the retraction is impossible, because again the retraction would induce an injective group homomorphism from the latter to the former group.

The impossibility of a retraction can also be shown using the de Rham cohomology of open subsets of Euclidean space &quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot;. For &quot;n&quot; ≥ 2, the de Rham cohomology of &quot;U&quot; = &quot;E&quot;&quot;n&quot; – (0) is one-dimensional in degree 0 and &quot;n&quot; – 1, and vanishes otherwise. If a retraction existed, then &quot;U&quot; would have to be contractible and its de Rham cohomology in degree &quot;n&quot; – 1 would have to vanish, a contradiction.

===A proof using Stokes&#x27; theorem===
As in the proof of Brouwer&#x27;s fixed-point theorem for continuous maps using homology, it is reduced to proving that there is no continuous retraction from the ball onto its boundary ∂. In that case it can be assumed that is smooth, since it can be approximated using the Weierstrass approximation theorem or by convolving with non-negative smooth bump functions of sufficiently small support and integral one (i.e. mollifying). If is a volume form on the boundary then by Stokes&#x27; theorem,
:formula_46
giving a contradiction.

More generally, this shows that there is no smooth retraction from any non-empty smooth oriented compact manifold onto its boundary. The proof using Stokes&#x27; theorem is closely related to the proof using homology, because the form generates the de Rham cohomology group (∂) which is isomorphic to the homology group (∂) by de Rham&#x27;s theorem.

===A combinatorial proof===
The BFPT can be proved using Sperner&#x27;s lemma. We now give an outline of the proof for the special case in which &quot;f&quot; is a function from the standard &quot;n&quot;-simplex, formula_47 to itself, where

:formula_48

For every point formula_49 also formula_50 Hence the sum of their coordinates is equal:

:formula_51

Hence, by the pigeonhole principle, for every formula_49 there must be an index formula_53 such that the formula_54th coordinate of formula_55 is greater than or equal to the formula_54th coordinate of its image under &quot;f&quot;:

:formula_57

Moreover, if formula_55 lies on a &quot;k&quot;-dimensional sub-face of formula_47 then by the same argument, the index formula_54 can be selected from among the coordinates which are not zero on this sub-face.

We now use this fact to construct a Sperner coloring. For every triangulation of formula_47 the color of every vertex formula_55 is an index formula_54 such that formula_64

By construction, this is a Sperner coloring. Hence, by Sperner&#x27;s lemma, there is an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional simplex whose vertices are colored with the entire set of available colors.

Because &quot;f&quot; is continuous, this simplex can be made arbitrarily small by choosing an arbitrarily fine triangulation. Hence, there must be a point formula_55 which satisfies the labeling condition in all coordinates: formula_66 for all formula_67

Because the sum of the coordinates of formula_55 and formula_69 must be equal, all these inequalities must actually be equalities. But this means that:

:formula_70

That is, formula_55 is a fixed point of formula_72

===A proof by Hirsch===
There is also a quick proof, by Morris Hirsch, based on the impossibility of a differentiable retraction. The indirect proof starts by noting that the map &quot;f&quot; can be approximated by a smooth map retaining the property of not fixing a point; this can be done by using the Weierstrass approximation theorem or by convolving with smooth bump functions. One then defines a retraction as above which must now be differentiable. Such a retraction must have a non-singular value, by Sard&#x27;s theorem, which is also non-singular for the restriction to the boundary (which is just the identity). Thus the inverse image would be a 1-manifold with boundary. The boundary would have to contain at least two end points, both of which would have to lie on the boundary of the original ball—which is impossible in a retraction.

R. Bruce Kellogg, Tien-Yien Li, and James A. Yorke turned Hirsch&#x27;s proof into a computable proof by observing that the retract is in fact defined everywhere except at the fixed points. For almost any point, &quot;q&quot;, on the boundary, (assuming it is not a fixed point) the one manifold with boundary mentioned above does exist and the only possibility is that it leads from &quot;q&quot; to a fixed point. It is an easy numerical task to follow such a path from &quot;q&quot; to the fixed point so the method is essentially computable. gave a conceptually similar path-following version of the homotopy proof which extends to a wide variety of related problems.

===A proof using oriented area===
A variation of the preceding proof does not employ the Sard&#x27;s theorem, and goes as follows. If formula_73 is a smooth retraction, one considers the smooth deformation formula_74 and the smooth function
:formula_75
Differentiating under the sign of integral it is not difficult to check that &quot;&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) = 0 for all &quot;t&quot;, so &quot;φ&quot; is a constant function, which is a contradiction because &quot;φ&quot;(0) is the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional volume of the ball, while &quot;φ&quot;(1) is zero. The geometric idea is that &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is the oriented area of &quot;g&quot;&quot;t&quot;(&quot;B&quot;) (that is, the Lebesgue measure of the image of the ball via &quot;g&quot;&quot;t&quot;, taking into account multiplicity and orientation), and should remain constant (as it is very clear in the one-dimensional case). On the other hand, as the parameter &quot;t&quot; passes from 0 to 1 the map &quot;g&quot;&quot;t&quot; transforms continuously from the identity map of the ball, to the retraction &quot;r&quot;, which is a contradiction since the oriented area of the identity coincides with the volume of the ball, while the oriented area of &quot;r&quot; is necessarily 0, as its image is the boundary of the ball, a set of null measure.

===A proof using the game Hex===
A quite different proof given by David Gale is based on the game of Hex. The basic theorem regarding Hex, first proven by John Nash, is that no game of Hex can end in a draw; the first player always has a winning strategy (although this theorem is nonconstructive, and explicit strategies have not been fully developed for board sizes of dimensions 10 x 10 or greater). This turns out to be equivalent to the Brouwer fixed-point theorem for dimension 2. By considering &quot;n&quot;-dimensional versions of Hex, one can prove in general that Brouwer&#x27;s theorem is equivalent to the determinacy theorem for Hex.

===A proof using the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem===
The Lefschetz fixed-point theorem says that if a continuous map &quot;f&quot; from a finite simplicial complex &quot;B&quot; to itself has only isolated fixed points, then the number of fixed points counted with multiplicities (which may be negative) is equal to the Lefschetz number
:formula_76
and in particular if the Lefschetz number is nonzero then &quot;f&quot; must have a fixed point. If &quot;B&quot; is a ball (or more generally is contractible) then the Lefschetz number is one because the only non-zero simplicial homology group is: formula_77 and &quot;f&quot; acts as the identity on this group, so &quot;f&quot; has a fixed point.

===A proof in a weak logical system===
In reverse mathematics, Brouwer&#x27;s theorem can be proved in the system WKL0, and conversely over the base system RCA0 Brouwer&#x27;s theorem for a square implies the weak Kőnig&#x27;s lemma, so this gives a precise description of the strength of Brouwer&#x27;s theorem.

==Generalizations==
The Brouwer fixed-point theorem forms the starting point of a number of more general fixed-point theorems.

The straightforward generalization to infinite dimensions, i.e. using the unit ball of an arbitrary Hilbert space instead of Euclidean space, is not true. The main problem here is that the unit balls of infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces are not compact. For example, in the Hilbert space ℓ2 of square-summable real (or complex) sequences, consider the map &quot;f&quot; : ℓ2 → ℓ2 which sends a sequence (&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;) from the closed unit ball of ℓ2 to the sequence (&quot;y&quot;&quot;n&quot;) defined by
:formula_78

It is not difficult to check that this map is continuous, has its image in the unit sphere of ℓ2, but does not have a fixed point.

The generalizations of the Brouwer fixed-point theorem to infinite dimensional spaces therefore all include a compactness assumption of some sort, and also often an assumption of convexity. See fixed-point theorems in infinite-dimensional spaces for a discussion of these theorems.

There is also finite-dimensional generalization to a larger class of spaces: If formula_79 is a product of finitely many chainable continua, then every continuous function formula_80 has a fixed point, where a chainable continuum is a (usually but in this case not necessarily metric) compact Hausdorff space of which every open cover has a finite open refinement formula_81, such that formula_82 if and only if formula_83. Examples of chainable continua include compact connected linearly ordered spaces and in particular closed intervals of real numbers.

The Kakutani fixed point theorem generalizes the Brouwer fixed-point theorem in a different direction: it stays in R&quot;n&quot;, but considers upper hemi-continuous set-valued functions (functions that assign to each point of the set a subset of the set). It also requires compactness and convexity of the set.

The Lefschetz fixed-point theorem applies to (almost) arbitrary compact topological spaces, and gives a condition in terms of singular homology that guarantees the existence of fixed points; this condition is trivially satisfied for any map in the case of &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot;.

<doc id="4106" wikidata="Q191700" url="?curid=4106" title="Benzoic acid">
<text>Benzoic acid () is a white (or colorless) solid organic compound with the formula , whose structure consists of a benzene ring () with a carboxyl () substituent. The benzoyl group is often abbreviated &quot;Bz&quot; (not to be confused with &quot;Bn,&quot; which is used for benzyl), thus benzoic acid is also denoted as BzOH, since the benzoyl group has the formula –. It is the simplest aromatic carboxylic acid. The name is derived from gum benzoin, which was for a long time its only source. 

Benzoic acid occurs naturally in many plants and serves as an intermediate in the biosynthesis of many secondary metabolites. Salts of benzoic acid are used as food preservatives. Benzoic acid is an important precursor for the industrial synthesis of many other organic substances. The salts and esters of benzoic acid are known as benzoates ().

== History ==
Benzoic acid was discovered in the sixteenth century. The dry distillation of gum benzoin was first described by Nostradamus (1556), and then by Alexius Pedemontanus (1560) and Blaise de Vigenère (1596).

Justus von Liebig and Friedrich Wöhler determined the composition of benzoic acid. These latter also investigated how hippuric acid is related to benzoic acid.

In 1875 Salkowski discovered the antifungal properties of benzoic acid, which explains the preservation of benzoate-containing cloudberry fruits.

== Production ==

=== Industrial preparations ===
Benzoic acid is produced commercially by partial oxidation of toluene with oxygen. The process is catalyzed by cobalt or manganese naphthenates. The process uses abundant materials, and proceeds in high yield.

The first industrial process involved the reaction of benzotrichloride (trichloromethyl benzene) with calcium hydroxide in water, using iron or iron salts as catalyst. The resulting calcium benzoate is converted to benzoic acid with hydrochloric acid. The product contains significant amounts of chlorinated benzoic acid derivatives. For this reason, benzoic acid for human consumption was obtained by dry distillation of gum benzoin. Food-grade benzoic acid is now produced synthetically.

=== Laboratory synthesis ===
Benzoic acid is cheap and readily available, so the laboratory synthesis of benzoic acid is mainly practiced for its pedagogical value. It is a common undergraduate preparation.

Benzoic acid can be purified by recrystallization from water because of its high solubility in hot water and poor solubility in cold water. The avoidance of organic solvents for the recrystallization makes this experiment particularly safe. This process usually gives a yield of around 65%.

==== By hydrolysis ====
Like other nitriles and amides, benzonitrile and benzamide can be hydrolyzed to benzoic acid or its conjugate base in acid or basic conditions.

==== From Grignard reagent====
Bromobenzene can be converted to benzoic acid by &quot;carboxylation&quot; of the intermediate phenylmagnesium bromide. This synthesis offers a convenient exercise for students to carry out a Grignard reaction, an important class of carbon–carbon bond forming reaction in organic chemistry.

==== Oxidation of benzyl compounds====
Benzyl alcohol and benzyl chloride and virtually all benzyl derivatives are readily oxidized to benzoic acid.

== Uses ==
Benzoic acid is mainly consumed in the production of phenol by oxidative decarboxylation at 300−400 °C:
The temperature required can be lowered to 200 °C by the addition of catalytic amounts of copper(II) salts. The phenol can be converted to cyclohexanol, which is a starting material for nylon synthesis.

===Precursor to plasticizers===
Benzoate plasticizers, such as the glycol-, diethyleneglycol-, and triethyleneglycol esters, are obtained by transesterification of methyl benzoate with the corresponding diol. These plasticizers, which are used similarly to those derived from terephthalic acid ester, represent alternatives to phthalates.

=== Precursor to sodium benzoate and related preservatives ===
Benzoic acid and its salts are used as food preservatives, represented by the E numbers E210, E211, E212, and E213. Benzoic acid inhibits the growth of mold, yeast and some bacteria. It is either added directly or created from reactions with its sodium, potassium, or calcium salt. The mechanism starts with the absorption of benzoic acid into the cell. If the intracellular pH changes to 5 or lower, the anaerobic fermentation of glucose through phosphofructokinase is decreased by 95%. The efficacy of benzoic acid and benzoate is thus dependent on the pH of the food. Benzoic acid, benzoates 
and their derivatives are used as preservatives for acidic foods and beverages such as citrus fruit juices (citric acid), sparkling drinks (carbon dioxide), soft drinks (phosphoric acid), pickles (vinegar) and other acidified foods.

Typical concentrations of benzoic acid as a preservative in food are between 0.05 and 0.1%. Foods in which benzoic acid may be used and maximum levels for its application are controlled by local food laws.

Concern has been expressed that benzoic acid and its salts may react with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) in some soft drinks, forming small quantities of carcinogenic benzene.
=== Medicinal ===
Benzoic acid is a constituent of Whitfield&#x27;s ointment which is used for the treatment of fungal skin diseases such as ringworm and athlete&#x27;s foot. As the principal component of gum benzoin, benzoic acid is also a major ingredient in both tincture of benzoin and Friar&#x27;s balsam. Such products have a long history of use as topical antiseptics and inhalant decongestants.

Benzoic acid was used as an expectorant, analgesic, and antiseptic in the early 20th century.

===Niche and laboratory uses===
In teaching laboratories, benzoic acid is a common standard for calibrating a bomb calorimeter.

== Biology and health effects ==
Benzoic acid occurs naturally as do its esters in many plant and animal species. Appreciable amounts are found in most berries (around 0.05%). Ripe fruits of several &quot;Vaccinium&quot; species (e.g., cranberry, &quot;V. vitis macrocarpon&quot;; bilberry, &quot;V. myrtillus&quot;) contain as much as 0.03–0.13% free benzoic acid. Benzoic acid is also formed in apples after infection with the fungus &quot;Nectria galligena&quot;. Among animals, benzoic acid has been identified primarily in omnivorous or phytophageous species, e.g., in viscera and muscles of the rock ptarmigan (&quot;Lagopus muta&quot;) as well as in gland secretions of male muskoxen (&quot;Ovibos moschatus&quot;) or Asian bull elephants (&quot;Elephas maximus&quot;). Gum benzoin contains up to 20% of benzoic acid and 40% benzoic acid esters.

In terms of its biosynthesis, benzoate is produced in plants from cinnamic acid. A pathway has been identified from phenol via 4-hydroxybenzoate.

== Reactions ==

Reactions of benzoic acid can occur at either the aromatic ring or at the carboxyl group.
===Aromatic ring===

Electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction will take place mainly in 3-position due to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic group; i.e. benzoic acid is &quot;meta&quot; directing.

=== Carboxyl group ===
Reactions typical for carboxylic acids apply also to benzoic acid.

* Benzoate esters are the product of the acid catalysed reaction with alcohols.
* Benzoic acid amides are usually prepared from benzoyl chloride.
* Dehydration to benzoic anhydride is induced with acetic anhydride or phosphorus pentoxide.
* Highly reactive acid derivatives such as acid halides are easily obtained by mixing with halogenation agents like phosphorus chlorides or thionyl chloride.
* Orthoesters can be obtained by the reaction of alcohols under acidic water free conditions with benzonitrile.
* Reduction to benzaldehyde and benzyl alcohol is possible using DIBAL-H, LiAlH4 or sodium borohydride.
* Decarboxylation to benzene may be effected by heating in quinoline in the presence of copper salts. Hunsdiecker decarboxylation can be achieved by heating the silver salt.


==Safety and mammalian metabolism==
It is excreted as hippuric acid. Benzoic acid is metabolized by butyrate-CoA ligase into an intermediate product, benzoyl-CoA, which is then metabolized by glycine &quot;N&quot;-acyltransferase into hippuric acid. Humans metabolize toluene which is also excreted as hippuric acid.

For humans, the World Health Organization&#x27;s International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS) suggests a provisional tolerable intake would be 5 mg/kg body weight per day. Cats have a significantly lower tolerance against benzoic acid and its salts than rats and mice. Lethal dose for cats can be as low as 300 mg/kg body weight. The oral for rats is 3040 mg/kg, for mice it is 1940–2263 mg/kg.

In Taipei, Taiwan, a city health survey in 2010 found that 30% of dried and pickled food products had benzoic acid.

<doc id="4107" wikidata="Q834200" url="?curid=4107" title="Boltzmann distribution">
<text>In statistical mechanics and mathematics, a Boltzmann distribution (also called Gibbs distribution) is a probability distribution or probability measure that gives the probability that a system will be in a certain state as a function of that state&#x27;s energy and the temperature of the system. The distribution is expressed in the form:

:formula_1

where is the probability of the system being in state , is the exponential function, is the energy of that state, and a constant of the distribution is the product of the Boltzmann constant and thermodynamic temperature . The symbol formula_2 denotes proportionality (see for the proportionality constant).

The term &quot;system&quot; here has a wide meaning; it can range from a collection of &#x27;sufficient number&#x27; of atoms or a single atom to a macroscopic system such as a natural gas storage tank. Therefore, the Boltzmann distribution can be used to solve a wide variety of problems. The distribution shows that states with lower energy will always have a higher probability of being occupied.

The &quot;ratio&quot; of probabilities of two states is known as the Boltzmann factor and characteristically only depends on the states&#x27; energy difference:

:formula_3

The Boltzmann distribution is named after Ludwig Boltzmann who first formulated it in 1868 during his studies of the statistical mechanics of gases in thermal equilibrium. Boltzmann&#x27;s statistical work is borne out in his paper “On the Relationship between the Second Fundamental Theorem of the Mechanical Theory of Heat and Probability Calculations Regarding the Conditions for Thermal Equilibrium&quot;
The distribution was later investigated extensively, in its modern generic form, by Josiah Willard Gibbs in 1902.

The Boltzmann distribution should not be confused with the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution or Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics. The Boltzmann distribution gives the probability that a system will be in a certain &quot;state&quot; as a function of that state&#x27;s energy, while the Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions give the probabilities of particle &quot;speeds&quot; or &quot;energies&quot; in ideal gases. The distribution of energies in a one-dimensional gas however, does follow the Boltzmann distribution.

==The distribution==

The Boltzmann distribution is a probability distribution that gives the probability of a certain state as a function of that state&#x27;s energy and temperature of the system to which the distribution is applied. It is given as
formula_4

where:
* is the exponential function,
* is the probability of state ,
* is the energy of state , 
* is the Boltzmann constant, 
* is the absolute temperature of the system,
* is the number of all states accessible to the system of interest, 
* (denoted by some authors by ) is the normalization denominator, which is the canonical partition functionformula_5 It results from the constraint that the probabilities of all accessible states must add up to 1.

Using Lagrange multipliers, one can prove that the Boltzmann distribution is the distribution that maximizes the entropy
formula_6

subject to the normalization constraint that formula_7 and the constraint that formula_8 equals a particular mean energy value, except for two special cases. (These special cases occur when the mean value is either the minimum or maximum of the energies . In these cases, the entropy maximizing distribution is a limit of Boltzmann distributions where approaches zero from above or below, respectively.)

The partition function can be calculated if we know the energies of the states accessible to the system of interest. For atoms the partition function values can be found in the NIST Atomic Spectra Database.

The distribution shows that states with lower energy will always have a higher probability of being occupied than the states with higher energy. It can also give us the quantitative relationship between the probabilities of the two states being occupied. The ratio of probabilities for states and is given as
formula_9

where:
* is the probability of state , 
* the probability of state , 
* is the energy of state ,
* is the energy of state .

The corresponding ratio of populations of energy levels must also take their degeneracies into account.

The Boltzmann distribution is often used to describe the distribution of particles, such as atoms or molecules, over bound states accessible to them. If we have a system consisting of many particles, the probability of a particle being in state is practically the probability that, if we pick a random particle from that system and check what state it is in, we will find it is in state . This probability is equal to the number of particles in state divided by the total number of particles in the system, that is the fraction of particles that occupy state .

:formula_10

where is the number of particles in state and is the total number of particles in the system. We may use the Boltzmann distribution to find this probability that is, as we have seen, equal to the fraction of particles that are in state i. So the equation that gives the fraction of particles in state as a function of the energy of that state is 
formula_11

This equation is of great importance to spectroscopy. In spectroscopy we observe a spectral line of atoms or molecules undergoing transitions from one state to another. In order for this to be possible, there must be some particles in the first state to undergo the transition. We may find that this condition is fulfilled by finding the fraction of particles in the first state. If it is negligible, the transition is very likely not observed at the temperature for which the calculation was done. In general, a larger fraction of molecules in the first state means a higher number of transitions to the second state. This gives a stronger spectral line. However, there are other factors that influence the intensity of a spectral line, such as whether it is caused by an allowed or a forbidden transition.

The softmax function commonly used in machine learning is related to the Boltzmann distribution:

== Generalized Boltzmann distribution ==
Distribution of the form
:formula_13
is called generalized Boltzmann distribution by some authors.

The Boltzmann distribution is a special case of the generalized Boltzmann distribution. The generalized Boltzmann distribution is used in statistical mechanics to describe canonical ensemble, grand canonical ensemble and isothermal–isobaric ensemble. The generalized Boltzmann distribution is usually derived from the principle of maximum entropy, but there are other derivations.

The generalized Boltzmann distribution has the following properties:
* It is the only distribution for which the entropy as defined by Gibbs entropy formula matches with the entropy as defined in classical thermodynamics.
* It is the only distribution that is mathematically consistent with the fundamental thermodynamic relation where state functions are described by ensemble average.

== In statistical mechanics ==
The Boltzmann distribution appears in statistical mechanics when considering closed systems of fixed composition that are in thermal equilibrium (equilibrium with respect to energy exchange). The most general case is the probability distribution for the canonical ensemble. Some special cases (derivable from the canonical ensemble) show the Boltzmann distribution in different aspects:

; Canonical ensemble (general case)
: The canonical ensemble gives the probabilities of the various possible states of a closed system of fixed volume, in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath. The canonical ensemble has a state probability distribution with the Boltzmann form.
; Statistical frequencies of subsystems&#x27; states (in a non-interacting collection)
: When the system of interest is a collection of many non-interacting copies of a smaller subsystem, it is sometimes useful to find the statistical frequency of a given subsystem state, among the collection. The canonical ensemble has the property of separability when applied to such a collection: as long as the non-interacting subsystems have fixed composition, then each subsystem&#x27;s state is independent of the others and is also characterized by a canonical ensemble. As a result, the expected statistical frequency distribution of subsystem states has the Boltzmann form.
; Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics of classical gases (systems of non-interacting particles)
: In particle systems, many particles share the same space and regularly change places with each other; the single-particle state space they occupy is a shared space. Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics give the expected number of particles found in a given single-particle state, in a classical gas of non-interacting particles at equilibrium. This expected number distribution has the Boltzmann form.

Although these cases have strong similarities, it is helpful to distinguish them as they generalize in different ways when the crucial assumptions are changed:
* When a system is in thermodynamic equilibrium with respect to both energy exchange &quot;and particle exchange&quot;, the requirement of fixed composition is relaxed and a grand canonical ensemble is obtained rather than canonical ensemble. On the other hand, if both composition and energy are fixed, then a microcanonical ensemble applies instead.
* If the subsystems within a collection &quot;do&quot; interact with each other, then the expected frequencies of subsystem states no longer follow a Boltzmann distribution, and even may not have an analytical solution. The canonical ensemble can however still be applied to the &quot;collective&quot; states of the entire system considered as a whole, provided the entire system is in thermal equilibrium.
* With &quot;quantum&quot; gases of non-interacting particles in equilibrium, the number of particles found in a given single-particle state does not follow Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics, and there is no simple closed form expression for quantum gases in the canonical ensemble. In the grand canonical ensemble the state-filling statistics of quantum gases are described by Fermi–Dirac statistics or Bose–Einstein statistics, depending on whether the particles are fermions or bosons, respectively.

== In mathematics ==

* In more general mathematical settings, the Boltzmann distribution is also known as the Gibbs measure.
* In statistics and machine learning, it is called a log-linear model.
* In deep learning, the Boltzmann distribution is used in the sampling distribution of stochastic neural networks such as the Boltzmann machine, restricted Boltzmann machine, energy-based models and deep Boltzmann machine. In deep learning, the Boltzmann machine is considered to be one of the unsupervised learning models. In the design of Boltzmann machine in deep learning, as the number of nodes are increased the difficulty of implementing in real time applications becomes critical, so a different type of architecture named Restricted Boltzmann machine is introduced.

== In economics ==

The Boltzmann distribution can be introduced to allocate permits in emissions trading. The new allocation method using the Boltzmann distribution can describe the most probable, natural, and unbiased distribution of emissions permits among multiple countries.

The Boltzmann distribution has the same form as the multinomial logit model. As a discrete choice model, this is very well known in economics since Daniel McFadden made the connection to random utility maximization.

<doc id="4109" wikidata="Q6517148" url="?curid=4109" title="Leg theory">
<text>Leg theory is a bowling tactic in the sport of cricket. The term &quot;leg theory&quot; is somewhat archaic, but the basic tactic remains a play in modern cricket.

Simply put, leg theory involves concentrating the bowling attack at or near the line of leg stump. This may or may not be accompanied by a concentration of fielders on the leg side. The line of attack aims to cramp the batsman, making him play the ball with the bat close to the body. This makes it difficult to hit the ball freely and score runs, especially on the off side. Since a leg theory attack means the batsman is more likely to hit the ball on the leg side, additional fielders on that side of the field can be effective in preventing runs and taking catches.

Stifling the batsman in this manner can lead to impatience and frustration, resulting in rash play by the batsman which in turn can lead to a quick dismissal. Concentrating attack on the leg stump is considered by many cricket fans and commentators to lead to boring play, as it stifles run scoring and encourages batsmen to play conservatively.

Leg theory can be a moderately successful tactic when used with both fast bowling and spin bowling, particularly leg spin to right-handed batsmen or off spin to left-handed batsmen. However, because it relies on lack of concentration or discipline by the batsman, it can be risky against patient and skilled players, especially batsmen who are strong on the leg side. The English opening bowlers Sydney Barnes and Frank Foster used leg theory with some success in Australia in 1911–12. In England, at around the same time, Fred Root was one of the main proponents of the same tactic.

==Fast leg theory==
In 1930, England captain Douglas Jardine, together with Nottinghamshire&#x27;s captain Arthur Carr and his bowlers Harold Larwood and Bill Voce, developed a variant of leg theory in which the bowlers bowled fast, short-pitched balls that would rise into the batsman&#x27;s body, together with a heavily stacked ring of close fielders on the leg side. The idea was that when the batsman defended against the ball, he would be likely to deflect the ball into the air for a catch.

Jardine called this modified form of the tactic &quot;fast leg theory&quot;. On the 1932–33 English tour of Australia, Larwood and Voce bowled fast leg theory at the Australian batsmen. It turned out to be extremely dangerous, and most Australian players sustained injuries from being hit by the ball. Wicket-keeper Bert Oldfield&#x27;s skull was fractured by a ball hitting his head (although the ball had first glanced off the bat and Larwood had an orthodox field), almost precipitating a riot by the Australian crowd.

The Australian press dubbed the tactic &quot;Bodyline&quot;, and claimed it was a deliberate attempt by the English team to intimidate and injure the Australian players. Reports of the controversy reaching England at the time described the bowling as &quot;fast leg theory&quot;, which sounded to many people to be a harmless and well-established tactic. This led to a serious misunderstanding amongst the English public and the Marylebone Cricket Club – the administrators of English cricket – of the dangers posed by Bodyline. The English press and cricket authorities declared the Australian protests to be a case of sore losing and &quot;squealing&quot;.

It was only with the return of the English team and the subsequent use of Bodyline against English players in England by the touring West Indian cricket team in 1933 that demonstrated to the country the dangers it posed. The MCC subsequently revised the Laws of Cricket to prevent the use of &quot;fast leg theory&quot; tactics in future, also limiting the traditional tactic.

<text>Bioleaching is the extraction or liberation of metals from their ores through the use of living organisms. Bioleaching is one of several applications within biohydrometallurgy and several methods are used to treat ores or concentrates containing copper, zinc, lead, arsenic, antimony, nickel, molybdenum, gold, silver, and cobalt.

Bioleaching falls into two broad categories. The first, is the use of microorganisms to oxidize refractory minerals to release valuable metals such and gold and silver. Most commonly the minerals that are the target of oxidization are pyrite and arsenopyrite.

The second category is leaching of sulphide minerals to release the associated metal, for example, leaching of pentlandite to release nickel, or the leaching of chalcocite, covellite or chalcopyrite to release copper.

== Process ==
Bioleaching can involve numerous ferrous iron and sulfur oxidizing bacteria, including &quot;Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans&quot; (formerly known as &quot;Thiobacillus ferrooxidans&quot;) and &quot;Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans &quot; (formerly known as &quot;Thiobacillus thiooxidans&quot;). As a general principle, in one proposed method of bacterial leaching known as Indirect Leaching, Fe3+ ions are used to oxidize the ore. This step is entirely independent of microbes. The role of the bacteria is further oxidation of the ore, but also the regeneration of the chemical oxidant Fe3+ from Fe2+. For example, bacteria catalyse the breakdown of the mineral pyrite (FeS2) by oxidising the sulfur and metal (in this case ferrous iron, (Fe2+)) using oxygen. This yields soluble products that can be further purified and refined to yield the desired metal.

Pyrite leaching (FeS2):
In the first step, disulfide is spontaneously oxidized to thiosulfate by ferric ion (Fe3+), which in turn is reduced to give ferrous ion (Fe2+):
:(1)   formula_1    spontaneous

The ferrous ion is then oxidized by bacteria using oxygen:
:(2)   formula_2    (iron oxidizers)

Thiosulfate is also oxidized by bacteria to give sulfate:
:(3)   formula_3    (sulfur oxidizers)

The ferric ion produced in reaction (2) oxidized more sulfide as in reaction (1), closing the cycle and given the net reaction:
:(4)  formula_4

The net products of the reaction are soluble ferrous sulfate and sulfuric acid.

The microbial oxidation process occurs at the cell membrane of the bacteria. The electrons pass into the cells and are used in biochemical processes to produce energy for the bacteria while reducing oxygen to water. The critical reaction is the oxidation of sulfide by ferric iron. The main role of the bacterial step is the regeneration of this reactant.

The process for copper is very similar, but the efficiency and kinetics depend on the copper mineralogy. The most efficient minerals are supergene minerals such as chalcocite, Cu2S and covellite, CuS. The main copper mineral chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) is not leached very efficiently, which is why the dominant copper-producing technology remains flotation, followed by smelting and refining. The leaching of CuFeS2 follows the two stages of being dissolved and then further oxidised, with Cu2+ ions being left in solution.

Chalcopyrite leaching:
:(1)   formula_5    spontaneous
:(2)   formula_6    (iron oxidizers)
:(3)   formula_7    (sulfur oxidizers)
net reaction:
:(4)  formula_8

In general, sulfides are first oxidized to elemental sulfur, whereas disulfides are oxidized to give thiosulfate, and the processes above can be applied to other sulfidic ores. Bioleaching of non-sulfidic ores such as pitchblende also uses ferric iron as an oxidant (e.g., UO2 + 2 Fe3+ ==&gt; UO22+ + 2 Fe2+). In this case, the sole purpose of the bacterial step is the regeneration of Fe3+. Sulfidic iron ores can be added to speed up the process and provide a source of iron. Bioleaching of non-sulfidic ores by layering of waste sulfides and elemental sulfur, colonized by &quot;Acidithiobacillus&quot; spp., has been accomplished, which provides a strategy for accelerated leaching of materials that do not contain sulfide minerals.

== Further processing ==
The dissolved copper (Cu2+) ions are removed from the solution by ligand exchange solvent extraction, which leaves other ions in the solution. The copper is removed by bonding to a ligand, which is a large molecule consisting of a number of smaller groups, each possessing a lone electron pair. The ligand-copper complex is extracted from the solution using an organic solvent such as kerosene:

:Cu2+(aq) + 2LH(organic) → CuL2(organic) + 2H+(aq)

The ligand donates electrons to the copper, producing a complex - a central metal atom (copper) bonded to the ligand. Because this complex has no charge, it is no longer attracted to polar water molecules and dissolves in the kerosene, which is then easily separated from the solution. Because the initial reaction is reversible, it is determined by pH. Adding concentrated acid reverses the equation, and the copper ions go back into an aqueous solution.

Then the copper is passed through an electro-winning process to increase its purity: An electric current is passed through the resulting solution of copper ions. Because copper ions have a 2+ charge, they are attracted to the negative cathodes and collect there.

The copper can also be concentrated and separated by displacing the copper with Fe from scrap iron:

:Cu2+(aq) + Fe(s) → Cu(s) + Fe2+(aq)

The electrons lost by the iron are taken up by the copper. Copper is the oxidising agent (it accepts electrons), and iron is the reducing agent (it loses electrons).

Traces of precious metals such as gold may be left in the original solution. Treating the mixture with sodium cyanide in the presence of free oxygen dissolves the gold. The gold is removed from the solution by adsorbing (taking it up on the surface) to charcoal.

==With fungi==
Several species of fungi can be used for bioleaching. Fungi can be grown on many different substrates, such as electronic scrap, catalytic converters, and fly ash from municipal waste incineration. Experiments have shown that two fungal strains (&quot;Aspergillus niger, Penicillium simplicissimum&quot;) were able to mobilize Cu and Sn by 65%, and Al, Ni, Pb, and Zn by more than 95%. &quot;Aspergillus niger&quot; can produce some organic acids such as citric acid. This form of leaching does not rely on microbial oxidation of metal but rather uses microbial metabolism as source of acids that directly dissolve the metal.

== Feasibility ==
===Economic feasibility===
Bioleaching is in general simpler and, therefore, cheaper to operate and maintain than traditional processes, since fewer specialists are needed to operate complex chemical plants. And low concentrations are not a problem for bacteria because they simply ignore the waste that surrounds the metals, attaining extraction yields of over 90% in some cases. These microorganisms actually gain energy by breaking down minerals into their constituent elements. The company simply collects the ions out of the solution after the bacteria have finished.

Bioleaching can be used to extract metals from low concentration ores such as gold that are too poor for other technologies. It can be used to partially replace the extensive crushing and grinding that translates to prohibitive cost and energy consumption in a conventional process. Because the lower cost of bacterial leaching outweighs the time it takes to extract the metal.

High concentration ores, such as copper, are more economical to smelt rather bioleach due to the slow speed of the bacterial leaching process compared to smelting. The slow speed of bioleaching introduces a significant delay in cash flow for new mines. Nonetheless, at the largest copper mine of the world, Escondida in Chile the process seems to be favorable.

Economically it is also very expensive and many companies once started can not keep up with the demand and end up in debt.

===In space===

In 2020 scientists showed, with an experiment with different gravity environments on the ISS, that microorganisms could be employed to mine useful elements from basaltic rocks via bioleaching in space.

== Environmental impact ==
The process is more environmentally friendly than traditional extraction methods. For the company this can translate into profit, since the necessary limiting of sulfur dioxide emissions during smelting is expensive. Less landscape damage occurs, since the bacteria involved grow naturally, and the mine and surrounding area can be left relatively untouched. As the bacteria breed in the conditions of the mine, they are easily cultivated and recycled.

Toxic chemicals are sometimes produced in the process. Sulfuric acid and H+ ions that have been formed can leak into the ground and surface water turning it acidic, causing environmental damage. Heavy ions such as iron, zinc, and arsenic leak during acid mine drainage. When the pH of this solution rises, as a result of dilution by fresh water, these ions precipitate, forming &quot;Yellow Boy&quot; pollution. For these reasons, a setup of bioleaching must be carefully planned, since the process can lead to a biosafety failure. Unlike other methods, once started, bioheap leaching cannot be quickly stopped, because leaching would still continue with rainwater and natural bacteria. Projects like Finnish Talvivaara proved to be environmentally and economically disastrous.

<doc id="4113" wikidata="Q852989" url="?curid=4113" title="Bouldering">
<text>Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls without the use of ropes or harnesses. While bouldering can be done without any equipment, most climbers use climbing shoes to help secure footholds, chalk to keep their hands dry and to provide a firmer grip, and bouldering mats to prevent injuries from falls. Unlike free solo climbing, which is also performed without ropes, bouldering problems (the sequence of moves that a climber performs to complete the climb) are usually less than tall. Traverses, which are a form of boulder problem, require the climber to climb horizontally from one end to another. Artificial climbing walls allow boulderers to climb indoors in areas without natural boulders. In addition, bouldering competitions take place in both indoor and outdoor settings.

The sport was originally a method of training for roped climbs and mountaineering, so climbers could practice specific moves at a safe distance from the ground. Additionally, the sport served to build stamina and increase finger strength. Throughout the 20th century, bouldering evolved into a separate discipline. Individual problems are assigned ratings based on difficulty. Although there have been various rating systems used throughout the history of bouldering, modern problems usually use either the V-scale or the Fontainebleau scale.

== Outdoor bouldering ==
The characteristics of boulder problems depend largely on the type of rock being climbed. For example, granite often features long cracks and slabs while sandstone rocks are known for their steep overhangs and frequent horizontal breaks. Limestone and volcanic rock are also used for bouldering.

There are many prominent bouldering areas throughout the United States, including Hueco Tanks in Texas, Mount Blue Sky in Colorado, The Appalachian Mountains in The Eastern United States, and The Buttermilks in Bishop, California. Squamish, British Columbia is one of the most popular bouldering areas in Canada. Europe is also home to a number of bouldering sites, such as Fontainebleau in France, Meschia in Italy, Albarracín in Spain, and various mountains throughout Switzerland.

== Indoor bouldering ==

Artificial climbing walls are used to simulate boulder problems in an indoor environment, usually at climbing gyms. These walls are constructed with wooden panels, polymer cement panels, concrete shells, or precast molds of actual rock walls. Holds, usually made of plastic, are then bolted onto the wall to create problems. Some problems use steep overhanging surfaces which force the climber to support much of their weight using their upper body strength.

Climbing gyms often feature multiple problems within the same section of wall. Historically, the most common method route-setters used to designate the intended problem was by placing colored tape next to each hold. For example, red tape would indicate one bouldering problem while green tape would be used to set a different problem in the same area. Indoor bouldering requires very little in terms of equipment: at minimum, climbing shoes; at maximum, a chalk bag, chalk, a brush, and climbing shoes.

== Grading ==

Bouldering problems are assigned numerical difficulty ratings by route-setters and climbers. The two most widely used rating systems are the V-scale and the Fontainebleau system.

The V-scale, which originated in the United States, is an open-ended rating system with higher numbers indicating a higher degree of difficulty. The V1 rating indicates that a problem can be completed by a novice climber in good physical condition after several attempts. The scale begins at V0, and as of 2024, the highest V rating that has been assigned to a bouldering problem is V17. Some climbing gyms also use a VB grade to indicate beginner problems.

The Fontainebleau scale follows a similar system, with each numerical grade divided into three ratings with the letters &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;c&quot;. For example, Fontainebleau 7A roughly corresponds with V6, while Fontainebleau 7C+ is equivalent to V10. In both systems, grades are further differentiated by appending &quot;+&quot; to indicate a small increase in difficulty. Despite this level of specificity, ratings of individual problems are often controversial, as ability level is not the only factor that affects how difficult a problem may be for a particular climber. Height, arm length, flexibility, and other body characteristics can also affect difficulty.

== Highball bouldering ==
Highball bouldering is &quot;a sub-discipline of bouldering in which climbers seek out tall, imposing lines to climb ropeless above crash pads.&quot; It may have begun in 1961 when John Gill, without top-rope rehearsal or bouldering pads (which did not exist), bouldered a steep face on a granite spire called &quot;The Thimble&quot;. In 2002 Jason Kehl completed the first highball at double-digit V-difficulty, called Evilution, a boulder in the Buttermilks of California, earning the grade of V12.

Important milestone ascents in this style include:

* &quot;Ambrosia&quot;, V11, a boulder in Bishop, California, climbed by Kevin Jorgeson in 2015.
*&quot;Too Big to Flail,&quot; V10, another line in Bishop, California, climbed by Alex Honnold in 2016.
*&quot;The Process&quot;, V16, a boulder in Bishop, California, first climbed by Daniel Woods in 2015.

== Competition bouldering ==

The International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) employs an indoor format (although competitions can also take place in an outdoor setting) that breaks the competition into three rounds: qualifications, semi-finals, and finals. The rounds feature different sets of four to six boulder problems, and each competitor has a fixed amount of time to attempt each problem. At the end of each round, competitors are ranked by the number of completed problems with ties settled by the total number of attempts taken to solve the problems.

Some competitions only permit climbers a fixed number of attempts at each problem with a timed rest period in between. In an open-format competition, all climbers compete simultaneously, and are given a fixed amount of time to complete as many problems as possible. More points are awarded for more difficult problems, while points are deducted for multiple attempts on the same problem.

In 2012, the IFSC submitted a proposal to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to include lead climbing in the 2020 Summer Olympics. The proposal was later revised to an &quot;overall&quot; competition, which would feature bouldering, lead climbing, and speed climbing. In 2016, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) officially approved climbing, along with four other sports, as an Olympic sport, based on their &quot;impact on gender equality, the youth appeal of the sports and the legacy value of adding them to the Tokyo Games&quot;.

== History ==
=== Modern bouldering ===
Modern recreational climbing began in the late 19th century in England, southeastern Germany, northern Italy, and France. Bouldering on the rocks of Fontainbleau outside of Paris began in the late 1800s, with the first guidebook written by Maurice Martin in 1945. Bouldering as training or a recreational past-time began also in the late 1800s in England and perhaps elsewhere. Oscar Eckenstein was an early proponent. 

In the late 1950s, John Gill, who is frequently called &quot;the father of modern bouldering&quot;, combined gymnastics with rock climbing, and felt that the best place to do that was on boulders or small outcrops. He developed a rating system that was closed-ended: B1 problems were as difficult as the most challenging roped routes of the time, B2 problems were more difficult, and B3 problems had been completed once. He also introduced chalk as a method of keeping the climber&#x27;s hands dry, promoted a dynamic climbing style, and emphasized the importance of strength training to complement skill. His 1969 article in the Journal of the American Alpine Club entitled &quot;The Art of Bouldering&quot; defines modern bouldering. As Gill improved in ability and influence, his ideas became the norm.

In the 1980s, two important training tools emerged. One important training tool was bouldering mats, also referred to as &quot;crash pads&quot;, which protected against injuries from falling and enabled boulderers to climb in areas that would have been too dangerous otherwise. The second important tool was indoor climbing walls, which helped spread the sport to areas without outdoor climbing and allowed serious climbers to train year-round. As the sport grew in popularity, new bouldering areas were developed throughout Europe and the United States, and more athletes began participating in bouldering competitions. The visibility of the sport greatly increased in the early 2000s, as YouTube videos and climbing blogs helped boulderers around the world to quickly learn techniques, find hard problems, and announce newly completed projects.

=== Notable ascents ===
Notable boulder climbs are chronicled by the climbing media to track progress in boulder climbing standards and levels of technical difficulty; in contrast, the hardest traditional climbing routes tend to be of lower technical difficulty due to the additional burden of having to place protection during the course of the climb, and due to the lack of any possibility of using natural protection on the most extreme climbs.

As of November 2022, the world&#x27;s hardest bouldering routes are &quot;Burden of Dreams&quot; by Nalle Hukkataival and &quot;Return of the Sleepwalker&quot; by Daniel Woods, both at proposed grades of . There are a number of routes with a confirmed climbing grade of , the first of which was &quot;Gioia&quot; by Christian Core in 2008 (and confirmed by Adam Ondra in 2011). As of December 2021, female climbers Josune Bereziartu, Ashima Shiraishi, and Kaddi Lehmann have repeated boulder problems at the boulder grade. On July 28, 2023, Katie Lamb became the first female climber to climb an -rated boulder by repeating &quot;Box Therapy&quot; at Rocky Mountain National Park. However, after Brooke Raboutou repeated the climb In October 2023, the boulder was ultimately downgraded to .

== Equipment ==
Unlike other climbing sports, bouldering can be performed safely and effectively with very little equipment, an aspect which makes the discipline highly appealing, but opinions differ. While bouldering pioneer John Sherman asserted that &quot;The only gear really needed to go bouldering is boulders,&quot; others suggest the use of climbing shoes and a chalkbag – a small pouch where ground-up chalk is kept – as the bare minimum, and more experienced boulderers typically bring multiple pairs of climbing shoes, chalk, brushes, crash pads, and a skincare kit.

Climbing shoes have the most direct impact on performance. Besides protecting the climber&#x27;s feet from rough surfaces, climbing shoes are designed to help the climber secure footholds. Climbing shoes typically fit much tighter than other athletic footwear and often curl the toes downwards to enable precise footwork. They are manufactured in a variety of different styles to perform in different situations. Stiffer shoes excel at securing small edges, whereas softer shoes provide greater sensitivity. The front of the shoe, called the &quot;toe box&quot;, can be asymmetric, which performs well on overhanging rocks, or symmetric, which is better suited for vertical problems and slabs.

To absorb sweat, most boulderers use gymnastics chalk on their hands, stored in a chalk bag, which can be tied around the waist (also called sport climbing chalk bags), allowing the climber to reapply chalk during the climb. There are also versions of floor chalk bags (also called bouldering chalk bags), which are usually bigger than sport climbing chalk bags and are meant to be kept on the floor while climbing; this is because boulders do not usually have so many movements as to require chalking up more than once. Different sizes of brushes are used to remove excess chalk and debris from boulders in between climbs; they are often attached to the end of a long straight object in order to reach higher holds. Crash pads, also referred to as bouldering mats, are foam cushions placed on the ground to protect climbers from injury after falling.

Boulder problems are generally shorter than from ground to top. This makes the sport significantly safer than free solo climbing, which is also performed without ropes, but with no upper limit on the height of the climb. However, minor injuries are common in bouldering, particularly sprained ankles and wrists. To prevent injuries, boulderers position crash pads near the boulder to provide a softer landing, as well as one or more spotters to help redirect the climber towards the pads. Upon landing, boulderers employ falling techniques similar to those used in gymnastics: spreading the impact across the entire body to avoid bone fractures and positioning limbs to allow joints to move freely throughout the impact.

== Techniques ==

Although every type of rock climbing requires a high level of strength and technique, bouldering is the most dynamic form of the sport, requiring the highest level of power and placing considerable strain on the body. Training routines that strengthen fingers and forearms are useful in preventing injuries such as tendonitis and ruptured ligaments. However, as with other forms of climbing, bouldering technique begins with proper footwork. Leg muscles are significantly stronger than arm muscles; thus, proficient boulderers use their arms to maintain balance and body positioning as much as possible, relying on their legs to push them up the rock. Boulderers also keep their arms straight with their shoulders engaged whenever feasible, allowing their bones to support their body weight rather than their muscles.

Bouldering movements are described as either &quot;static&quot; or &quot;dynamic&quot;. Static movements are those that are performed slowly, with the climber&#x27;s position controlled by maintaining contact on the boulder with the other three limbs. Dynamic movements use the climber&#x27;s momentum to reach holds that would be difficult or impossible to secure statically, with an increased risk of falling if the movement is not performed accurately.

== Environmental impact ==
Bouldering can damage vegetation that grows on rocks, such as moss and lichens. This can occur as a result of the climber intentionally cleaning the boulder, or unintentionally from repeated use of handholds and footholds. Vegetation on the ground surrounding the boulder can also be damaged from overuse, particularly by climbers laying down crash pads. Soil erosion can occur when boulderers trample vegetation while hiking off of established trails, or when they unearth small rocks near the boulder in an effort to make the landing zone safer in case of a fall. Other environmental concerns include littering, improperly disposed feces, and graffiti. These issues have caused some land managers to prohibit bouldering, as was the case in Tea Garden, a popular bouldering area in Rocklands, South Africa.

<doc id="4115" wikidata="Q1003183" url="?curid=4115" title="Boiling point">
<text>The boiling point of a substance is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of a liquid equals the pressure surrounding the liquid and the liquid changes into a vapor.

The boiling point of a liquid varies depending upon the surrounding environmental pressure. A liquid in a partial vacuum, i.e., under a lower pressure, has a lower boiling point than when that liquid is at atmospheric pressure. Because of this, water boils at 100°C (or with scientific precision: ) under standard pressure at sea level, but at at altitude. For a given pressure, different liquids will boil at different temperatures.

The normal boiling point (also called the atmospheric boiling point or the atmospheric pressure boiling point) of a liquid is the special case in which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the defined atmospheric pressure at sea level, one atmosphere. At that temperature, the vapor pressure of the liquid becomes sufficient to overcome atmospheric pressure and allow bubbles of vapor to form inside the bulk of the liquid. The standard boiling point has been defined by IUPAC since 1982 as the temperature at which boiling occurs under a pressure of one bar.

The heat of vaporization is the energy required to transform a given quantity (a mol, kg, pound, etc.) of a substance from a liquid into a gas at a given pressure (often atmospheric pressure).

Liquids may change to a vapor at temperatures below their boiling points through the process of evaporation. Evaporation is a surface phenomenon in which molecules located near the liquid&#x27;s edge, not contained by enough liquid pressure on that side, escape into the surroundings as vapor. On the other hand, boiling is a process in which molecules anywhere in the liquid escape, resulting in the formation of vapor bubbles within the liquid.

==Saturation temperature and pressure==
A &quot;saturated liquid&quot; contains as much thermal energy as it can without boiling (or conversely a &quot;saturated vapor&quot; contains as little thermal energy as it can without condensing).

Saturation temperature means &quot;boiling point&quot;. The saturation temperature is the temperature for a corresponding saturation pressure at which a liquid boils into its vapor phase. The liquid can be said to be saturated with thermal energy. Any addition of thermal energy results in a phase transition.

If the pressure in a system remains constant (isobaric), a vapor at saturation temperature will begin to condense into its liquid phase as thermal energy (heat) is removed. Similarly, a liquid at saturation temperature and pressure will boil into its vapor phase as additional thermal energy is applied.

The boiling point corresponds to the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the surrounding environmental pressure. Thus, the boiling point is dependent on the pressure. Boiling points may be published with respect to the NIST, USA standard pressure of 101.325 kPa (1 atm), or the IUPAC standard pressure of 100.000 kPa (1 bar). At higher elevations, where the atmospheric pressure is much lower, the boiling point is also lower. The boiling point increases with increased pressure up to the critical point, where the gas and liquid properties become identical. The boiling point cannot be increased beyond the critical point. Likewise, the boiling point decreases with decreasing pressure until the triple point is reached. The boiling point cannot be reduced below the triple point.

If the heat of vaporization and the vapor pressure of a liquid at a certain temperature are known, the boiling point can be calculated by using the Clausius–Clapeyron equation, thus:

:formula_1

where:
:formula_2 is the boiling point at the pressure of interest,
:formula_3 is the ideal gas constant,
:formula_4 is the vapor pressure of the liquid,
:formula_5 is some pressure where the corresponding formula_6 is known (usually data available at 1 atm or 100 kPa (1 bar)),
:formula_7 is the heat of vaporization of the liquid,
:formula_6 is the boiling temperature,
:formula_9 is the natural logarithm.

Saturation pressure is the pressure for a corresponding saturation temperature at which a liquid boils into its vapor phase. Saturation pressure and saturation temperature have a direct relationship: as saturation pressure is increased, so is saturation temperature.

If the temperature in a system remains constant (an &quot;isothermal&quot; system), vapor at saturation pressure and temperature will begin to condense into its liquid phase as the system pressure is increased. Similarly, a liquid at saturation pressure and temperature will tend to flash into its vapor phase as system pressure is decreased.

There are two conventions regarding the &quot;standard boiling point of water&quot;: The &quot;normal boiling point&quot; is commonly given as (actually following the thermodynamic definition of the Celsius scale based on the kelvin) at a pressure of 1 atm (101.325 kPa). The IUPAC-recommended &quot;standard boiling point of water&quot; at a standard pressure of 100 kPa (1 bar) is . For comparison, on top of Mount Everest, at elevation, the pressure is about and the boiling point of water is . The Celsius temperature scale was defined until 1954 by two points: 0 °C being defined by the water freezing point and 100 °C being defined by the water boiling point at standard atmospheric pressure.

== Relation between the normal boiling point and the vapor pressure of liquids ==

The higher the vapor pressure of a liquid at a given temperature, the lower the normal boiling point (i.e., the boiling point at atmospheric pressure) of the liquid.

The vapor pressure chart to the right has graphs of the vapor pressures versus temperatures for a variety of liquids. As can be seen in the chart, the liquids with the highest vapor pressures have the lowest normal boiling points.

For example, at any given temperature, methyl chloride has the highest vapor pressure of any of the liquids in the chart. It also has the lowest normal boiling point (−24.2 °C), which is where the vapor pressure curve of methyl chloride (the blue line) intersects the horizontal pressure line of one atmosphere (atm) of absolute vapor pressure.

The critical point of a liquid is the highest temperature (and pressure) it will actually boil at.

See also Vapour pressure of water.

== Boiling point of chemical elements ==

The element with the lowest boiling point is helium. Both the boiling points of rhenium and tungsten exceed 5000 K at standard pressure; because it is difficult to measure extreme temperatures precisely without bias, both have been cited in the literature as having the higher boiling point.

==Boiling point as a reference property of a pure compound==

As can be seen from the above plot of the logarithm of the vapor pressure vs. the temperature for any given pure chemical compound, its normal boiling point can serve as an indication of that compound&#x27;s overall volatility. A given pure compound has only one normal boiling point, if any, and a compound&#x27;s normal boiling point and melting point can serve as characteristic physical properties for that compound, listed in reference books. The higher a compound&#x27;s normal boiling point, the less volatile that compound is overall, and conversely, the lower a compound&#x27;s normal boiling point, the more volatile that compound is overall. Some compounds decompose at higher temperatures before reaching their normal boiling point, or sometimes even their melting point. For a stable compound, the boiling point ranges from its triple point to its critical point, depending on the external pressure. Beyond its triple point, a compound&#x27;s normal boiling point, if any, is higher than its melting point. Beyond the critical point, a compound&#x27;s liquid and vapor phases merge into one phase, which may be called a superheated gas. At any given temperature, if a compound&#x27;s normal boiling point is lower, then that compound will generally exist as a gas at atmospheric external pressure. If the compound&#x27;s normal boiling point is higher, then that compound can exist as a liquid or solid at that given temperature at atmospheric external pressure, and will so exist in equilibrium with its vapor (if volatile) if its vapors are contained. If a compound&#x27;s vapors are not contained, then some volatile compounds can eventually evaporate away in spite of their higher boiling points.
In general, compounds with ionic bonds have high normal boiling points, if they do not decompose before reaching such high temperatures. Many metals have high boiling points, but not all. Very generally—with other factors being equal—in compounds with covalently bonded molecules, as the size of the molecule (or molecular mass) increases, the normal boiling point increases. When the molecular size becomes that of a macromolecule, polymer, or otherwise very large, the compound often decomposes at high temperature before the boiling point is reached. Another factor that affects the normal boiling point of a compound is the polarity of its molecules. As the polarity of a compound&#x27;s molecules increases, its normal boiling point increases, other factors being equal. Closely related is the ability of a molecule to form hydrogen bonds (in the liquid state), which makes it harder for molecules to leave the liquid state and thus increases the normal boiling point of the compound. Simple carboxylic acids dimerize by forming hydrogen bonds between molecules. A minor factor affecting boiling points is the shape of a molecule. Making the shape of a molecule more compact tends to lower the normal boiling point slightly compared to an equivalent molecule with more surface area.


Most volatile compounds (anywhere near ambient temperatures) go through an intermediate liquid phase while warming up from a solid phase to eventually transform to a vapor phase. By comparison to boiling, a sublimation is a physical transformation in which a solid turns directly into vapor, which happens in a few select cases such as with carbon dioxide at atmospheric pressure. For such compounds, a sublimation point is a temperature at which a solid turning directly into vapor has a vapor pressure equal to the external pressure.

==Impurities and mixtures==
In the preceding section, boiling points of pure compounds were covered. Vapor pressures and boiling points of substances can be affected by the presence of dissolved impurities (solutes) or other miscible compounds, the degree of effect depending on the concentration of the impurities or other compounds. The presence of non-volatile impurities such as salts or compounds of a volatility far lower than the main component compound decreases its mole fraction and the solution&#x27;s volatility, and thus raises the normal boiling point in proportion to the concentration of the solutes. This effect is called boiling point elevation. As a common example, salt water boils at a higher temperature than pure water.

In other mixtures of miscible compounds (components), there may be two or more components of varying volatility, each having its own pure component boiling point at any given pressure. The presence of other volatile components in a mixture affects the vapor pressures and thus boiling points and dew points of all the components in the mixture. The dew point is a temperature at which a vapor condenses into a liquid. Furthermore, at any given temperature, the composition of the vapor is different from the composition of the liquid in most such cases. In order to illustrate these effects between the volatile components in a mixture, a boiling point diagram is commonly used. Distillation is a process of boiling and [usually] condensation which takes advantage of these differences in composition between liquid and vapor phases.

== Boiling point of water with elevation ==
Following is a table of the change in the boiling point of water with elevation, at intervals of 500 meters over the range of human habitation [the Dead Sea at to La Rinconada, Peru at ], then of 1,000 meters over the additional range of uninhabited surface elevation [up to Mount Everest at ], along with a similar range in Imperial.

<doc id="4116" wikidata="Q323" url="?curid=4116" title="Big Bang">
<text>The Big Bang is a physical theory that describes how the universe expanded from an initial state of high density and temperature. The concept of an expanding universe was scientifically originated by physicist Alexander Friedmann in 1922 with the mathematical derivation of the Friedmann equations. The earliest empirical observation of an expanding universe is known as Hubble&#x27;s law, published in work by physicist Edwin Hubble in 1929, which discerned that galaxies are moving away from Earth at a rate that accelerates proportionally with distance. Independent of Friedmann&#x27;s work, and independent of Hubble&#x27;s observations, physicist Georges Lemaître proposed that the universe emerged from a &quot;primeval atom&quot; in 1931, introducing the modern notion of the Big Bang.

Various cosmological models of the Big Bang explain the evolution of the observable universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale form. These models offer a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, and large-scale structure. The uniformity of the universe, known as the horizon and flatness problems, is explained through cosmic inflation: a phase of accelerated expansion during the earliest stages.

Extrapolating this cosmic expansion backward in time using the known laws of physics, the models describe an increasingly concentrated cosmos preceded by a singularity in which space and time lose meaning (typically named &quot;the Big Bang singularity&quot;). Physics lacks a widely accepted theory of quantum gravity that can model the earliest conditions of the Big Bang. In 1964, the CMB was discovered, which convinced many cosmologists that the competing steady-state model of cosmic evolution was falsified, since the Big Bang models predict a uniform background radiation caused by high temperatures and densities in the distant past. A wide range of empirical evidence strongly favors the Big Bang event, which is now essentially universally accepted. Detailed measurements of the expansion rate of the universe place the Big Bang singularity at an estimated  billion years ago, which is considered the age of the universe.

There remain aspects of the observed universe that are not yet adequately explained by the Big Bang models. As the universe expanded, it cooled sufficiently to allow the formation of subatomic particles, and later atoms. The unequal abundances of matter and antimatter that allowed this to occur is an unexplained effect known as baryon asymmetry. These primordial elements—mostly hydrogen, with some helium and lithium—later coalesced through gravity, forming early stars and galaxies. Astronomers observe the gravitational effects of an unknown dark matter surrounding galaxies. Most of the gravitational potential in the universe seems to be in this form, and the Big Bang models and various observations indicate that this excess gravitational potential is not created by baryonic matter, such as normal atoms. Measurements of the redshifts of supernovae indicate that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, an observation attributed to an unexplained phenomenon known as dark energy.

== Features of the models ==
The Big Bang models offer a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena, including the abundances of the light elements, the cosmic microwave background, large-scale structure, and Hubble&#x27;s law. The models depend on two major assumptions: the universality of physical laws and the cosmological principle. The universality of physical laws is one of the underlying principles of the theory of relativity. The cosmological principle states that on large scales the universe is homogeneous and isotropic—appearing the same in all directions regardless of location.

These ideas were initially taken as postulates, but later efforts were made to test each of them. For example, the first assumption has been tested by observations showing that the largest possible deviation of the fine-structure constant over much of the age of the universe is of order 10−5. Also, general relativity has passed stringent tests on the scale of the Solar System and binary stars.

The large-scale universe appears isotropic as viewed from Earth. If it is indeed isotropic, the cosmological principle can be derived from the simpler Copernican principle, which states that there is no preferred (or special) observer or vantage point. To this end, the cosmological principle has been confirmed to a level of 10−5 via observations of the temperature of the CMB. At the scale of the CMB horizon, the universe has been measured to be homogeneous with an upper bound on the order of 10% inhomogeneity, as of 1995.

===Horizons===

An important feature of the Big Bang spacetime is the presence of particle horizons. Since the universe has a finite age, and light travels at a finite speed, there may be events in the past whose light has not yet had time to reach earth. This places a limit or a &quot;past horizon&quot; on the most distant objects that can be observed. Conversely, because space is expanding, and more distant objects are receding ever more quickly, light emitted by us today may never &quot;catch up&quot; to very distant objects. This defines a &quot;future horizon&quot;, which limits the events in the future that we will be able to influence. The presence of either type of horizon depends on the details of the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) metric that describes the expansion of the universe.

Our understanding of the universe back to very early times suggests that there is a past horizon, though in practice our view is also limited by the opacity of the universe at early times. So our view cannot extend further backward in time, though the horizon recedes in space. If the expansion of the universe continues to accelerate, there is a future horizon as well.

===Thermalization===
Some processes in the early universe occurred too slowly, compared to the expansion rate of the universe, to reach approximate thermodynamic equilibrium. Others were fast enough to reach thermalization. The parameter usually used to find out whether a process in the very early universe has reached thermal equilibrium is the ratio between the rate of the process (usually rate of collisions between particles) and the Hubble parameter. The larger the ratio, the more time particles had to thermalize before they were too far away from each other.

== Timeline ==
According to the Big Bang models, the universe at the beginning was very hot and very compact, and since then it has been expanding and cooling.

=== Singularity ===

Extrapolation of the expansion of the universe backwards in time using general relativity yields a gravitational singularity with infinite density and temperature at a finite time in the past. However, classical gravitational theories are expected to be inadequate to describe physics under these conditions. Quantum gravity effects are expected to be dominant during the Planck epoch, when the temperature of the universe was close to the Planck scale (around 1032 K or 1028 eV).

Even below the Planck scale, undiscovered physics could greatly influence the expansion history of the universe. The Standard Model of particle physics is only tested up to temperatures of order 1017K (10 TeV) in particle colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider. Moreover, new physical phenomena decoupled from the Standard Model could have been important before the time of neutrino decoupling, when the temperature of the universe was only about 1010K (1 MeV).

=== Inflation and baryogenesis ===

The earliest phases of the Big Bang are subject to much speculation, given the lack of available data. In the most common models the universe was filled homogeneously and isotropically with a very high energy density and huge temperatures and pressures, and was very rapidly expanding and cooling. The period up to 10−43 seconds into the expansion, the Planck epoch, was a phase in which the four fundamental forces—the electromagnetic force, the strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, and the gravitational force, were unified as one. In this stage, the characteristic scale length of the universe was the Planck length, , and consequently had a temperature of approximately 1032 degrees Celsius. Even the very concept of a particle breaks down in these conditions. A proper understanding of this period awaits the development of a theory of quantum gravity. The Planck epoch was succeeded by the grand unification epoch beginning at 10−43 seconds, where gravitation separated from the other forces as the universe&#x27;s temperature fell.

At approximately 10−37 seconds into the expansion, a phase transition caused a cosmic inflation, during which the universe grew exponentially, unconstrained by the light speed invariance, and temperatures dropped by a factor of 100,000. This concept is motivated by the flatness problem, where the density of matter and energy is very close to the critical density needed to produce a flat universe. That is, the shape of the universe has no overall geometric curvature due to gravitational influence. Microscopic quantum fluctuations that occurred because of Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainty principle were &quot;frozen in&quot; by inflation, becoming amplified into the seeds that would later form the large-scale structure of the universe. At a time around 10−36 seconds, the electroweak epoch begins when the strong nuclear force separates from the other forces, with only the electromagnetic force and weak nuclear force remaining unified.

Inflation stopped locally at around 10−33 to 10−32 seconds, with the observable universe&#x27;s volume having increased by a factor of at least 1078. Reheating followed as the inflaton field decayed, until the universe obtained the temperatures required for the production of a quark–gluon plasma as well as all other elementary particles. Temperatures were so high that the random motions of particles were at relativistic speeds, and particle–antiparticle pairs of all kinds were being continuously created and destroyed in collisions. At some point, an unknown reaction called baryogenesis violated the conservation of baryon number, leading to a very small excess of quarks and leptons over antiquarks and antileptons—of the order of one part in 30 million. This resulted in the predominance of matter over antimatter in the present universe.

=== Cooling ===
The universe continued to decrease in density and fall in temperature, hence the typical energy of each particle was decreasing. Symmetry-breaking phase transitions put the fundamental forces of physics and the parameters of elementary particles into their present form, with the electromagnetic force and weak nuclear force separating at about 10−12 seconds.

After about 10−11 seconds, the picture becomes less speculative, since particle energies drop to values that can be attained in particle accelerators. At about 10−6 seconds, quarks and gluons combined to form baryons such as protons and neutrons. The small excess of quarks over antiquarks led to a small excess of baryons over antibaryons. The temperature was no longer high enough to create either new proton–antiproton or neutron–antineutron pairs. A mass annihilation immediately followed, leaving just one in 108 of the original matter particles and none of their antiparticles. A similar process happened at about 1 second for electrons and positrons. After these annihilations, the remaining protons, neutrons and electrons were no longer moving relativistically and the energy density of the universe was dominated by photons (with a minor contribution from neutrinos).

A few minutes into the expansion, when the temperature was about a billion kelvin and the density of matter in the universe was comparable to the current density of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, neutrons combined with protons to form the universe&#x27;s deuterium and helium nuclei in a process called Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). Most protons remained uncombined as hydrogen nuclei.

As the universe cooled, the rest energy density of matter came to gravitationally dominate over that of the photon and neutrino radiation at a time of about 50,000 years. At a time of about 380,000 years, the universe cooled enough that electrons and nuclei combined into neutral atoms (mostly hydrogen) in an event called recombination. This process made the previously opaque universe transparent, and the photons that last scattered during this epoch comprise the cosmic microwave background.

=== Structure formation ===
After the recombination epoch, the slightly denser regions of the uniformly distributed matter gravitationally attracted nearby matter and thus grew even denser, forming gas clouds, stars, galaxies, and the other astronomical structures observable today. The details of this process depend on the amount and type of matter in the universe. The four possible types of matter are known as cold dark matter (CDM), warm dark matter, hot dark matter, and baryonic matter. The best measurements available, from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), show that the data is well-fit by a Lambda-CDM model in which dark matter is assumed to be cold. This CDM is estimated to make up about 23% of the matter/energy of the universe, while baryonic matter makes up about 4.6%.

=== Cosmic acceleration ===

Independent lines of evidence from Type Ia supernovae and the CMB imply that the universe today is dominated by a mysterious form of energy known as dark energy, which appears to homogeneously permeate all of space. Observations suggest that 73% of the total energy density of the present day universe is in this form. When the universe was very young it was likely infused with dark energy, but with everything closer together, gravity predominated, braking the expansion. Eventually, after billions of years of expansion, the declining density of matter relative to the density of dark energy allowed the expansion of the universe to begin to accelerate.

Dark energy in its simplest formulation is modeled by a cosmological constant term in Einstein field equations of general relativity, but its composition and mechanism are unknown. More generally, the details of its equation of state and relationship with the Standard Model of particle physics continue to be investigated both through observation and theory.

All of this cosmic evolution after the inflationary epoch can be rigorously described and modeled by the lambda-CDM model of cosmology, which uses the independent frameworks of quantum mechanics and general relativity. There are no easily testable models that would describe the situation prior to approximately 10−15 seconds. Understanding this earliest of eras in the history of the universe is one of the greatest unsolved problems in physics.

==Concept history==

===Etymology===
English astronomer Fred Hoyle is credited with coining the term &quot;Big Bang&quot; during a talk for a March 1949 BBC Radio broadcast, saying: &quot;These theories were based on the hypothesis that all the matter in the universe was created in one big bang at a particular time in the remote past.&quot; However, it did not catch on until the 1970s.

It is popularly reported that Hoyle, who favored an alternative &quot;steady-state&quot; cosmological model, intended this to be pejorative, but Hoyle explicitly denied this and said it was just a striking image meant to highlight the difference between the two models. Helge Kragh writes that the evidence for the claim that it was meant as a pejorative is &quot;unconvincing&quot;, and mentions a number of indications that it was not a pejorative.

A primordial singularity is sometimes called &quot;the Big Bang&quot;, but the term can also refer to a more generic early hot, dense phase. The term itself has been argued to be a misnomer because it evokes an explosion. The argument is that whereas an explosion suggests expansion into a surrounding space, the Big Bang only describes the intrinsic expansion of the contents of the universe. Another issue pointed out by Santhosh Mathew is that bang implies sound, which is not an important feature of the model. However, an attempt to find a more suitable alternative was not successful. According to Timothy Ferris:
The term &#x27;big bang&#x27; was coined with derisive intent by Fred Hoyle, and its endurance testifies to Sir Fred&#x27;s creativity and wit. Indeed, the term survived an international competition in which three judges — the television science reporter Hugh Downs, the astronomer Carl Sagan, and myself — sifted through 13,099 entries from 41 countries and concluded that none was apt enough to replace it. No winner was declared, and like it or not, we are stuck with &#x27;big bang&#x27;.

===Before the name===

Early cosmological models developed from observations of the structure of the universe and from theoretical considerations. In 1912, Vesto Slipher measured the first Doppler shift of a &quot;spiral nebula&quot; (spiral nebula is the obsolete term for spiral galaxies), and soon discovered that almost all such nebulae were receding from Earth. He did not grasp the cosmological implications of this fact, and indeed at the time it was highly controversial whether or not these nebulae were &quot;island universes&quot; outside our Milky Way. Ten years later, Alexander Friedmann, a Russian cosmologist and mathematician, derived the Friedmann equations from the Einstein field equations, showing that the universe might be expanding in contrast to the static universe model advocated by Albert Einstein at that time.

In 1924, American astronomer Edwin Hubble&#x27;s measurement of the great distance to the nearest spiral nebulae showed that these systems were indeed other galaxies. Starting that same year, Hubble painstakingly developed a series of distance indicators, the forerunner of the cosmic distance ladder, using the Hooker telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory. This allowed him to estimate distances to galaxies whose redshifts had already been measured, mostly by Slipher. In 1929, Hubble discovered a correlation between distance and recessional velocity—now known as Hubble&#x27;s law.

Independently deriving Friedmann&#x27;s equations in 1927, Georges Lemaître, a Belgian physicist and Roman Catholic priest, proposed that the recession of the nebulae was due to the expansion of the universe. He inferred the relation that Hubble would later observe, given the cosmological principle. In 1931, Lemaître went further and suggested that the evident expansion of the universe, if projected back in time, meant that the further in the past the smaller the universe was, until at some finite time in the past all the mass of the universe was concentrated into a single point, a &quot;primeval atom&quot; where and when the fabric of time and space came into existence.

In the 1920s and 1930s, almost every major cosmologist preferred an eternal steady-state universe, and several complained that the beginning of time implied by an expanding universe imported religious concepts into physics; this objection was later repeated by supporters of the steady-state theory. This perception was enhanced by the fact that the originator of the expanding universe concept, Lemaître, was a Roman Catholic priest. Arthur Eddington agreed with Aristotle that the universe did not have a beginning in time, &quot;viz&quot;., that matter is eternal. A beginning in time was &quot;repugnant&quot; to him. Lemaître, however, disagreed:
During the 1930s, other ideas were proposed as non-standard cosmologies to explain Hubble&#x27;s observations, including the Milne model, the oscillatory universe (originally suggested by Friedmann, but advocated by Albert Einstein and Richard C. Tolman) and Fritz Zwicky&#x27;s tired light hypothesis.

After World War II, two distinct possibilities emerged. One was Fred Hoyle&#x27;s steady-state model, whereby new matter would be created as the universe seemed to expand. In this model the universe is roughly the same at any point in time. The other was Lemaître&#x27;s expanding universe theory, advocated and developed by George Gamow, who used it to develop a theory for the abundance of chemical elements in the universe. and whose associates, Ralph Alpher and Robert Herman, predicted the cosmic background radiation.

=== As a named model ===
Ironically, it was Hoyle who coined the phrase that came to be applied to Lemaître&#x27;s theory, referring to it as &quot;this &quot;big bang&quot; idea&quot; during a BBC Radio broadcast in March 1949. For a while, support was split between these two theories. Eventually, the observational evidence, most notably from radio source counts, began to favor Big Bang over steady state. The discovery and confirmation of the CMB in 1964 secured the Big Bang as the best theory of the origin and evolution of the universe.

In 1968 and 1970, Roger Penrose, Stephen Hawking, and George F. R. Ellis published papers where they showed that mathematical singularities were an inevitable initial condition of relativistic models of the Big Bang. Then, from the 1970s to the 1990s, cosmologists worked on characterizing the features of the Big Bang universe and resolving outstanding problems. In 1981, Alan Guth made a breakthrough in theoretical work on resolving certain outstanding theoretical problems in the Big Bang models with the introduction of an epoch of rapid expansion in the early universe he called &quot;inflation&quot;. Meanwhile, during these decades, two questions in observational cosmology that generated much discussion and disagreement were over the precise values of the Hubble Constant and the matter-density of the universe (before the discovery of dark energy, thought to be the key predictor for the eventual fate of the universe).

Significant progress in Big Bang cosmology has been made since the late 1990s as a result of advances in telescope technology as well as the analysis of data from satellites such as the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE), the Hubble Space Telescope and WMAP. Cosmologists now have fairly precise and accurate measurements of many of the parameters of the Big Bang model, and have made the unexpected discovery that the expansion of the universe appears to be accelerating.

==Observational evidence==

The earliest and most direct observational evidence of the validity of the theory are the expansion of the universe according to Hubble&#x27;s law (as indicated by the redshifts of galaxies), discovery and measurement of the cosmic microwave background and the relative abundances of light elements produced by Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). More recent evidence includes observations of galaxy formation and evolution, and the distribution of large-scale cosmic structures. These are sometimes called the &quot;four pillars&quot; of the Big Bang models.

Precise modern models of the Big Bang appeal to various exotic physical phenomena that have not been observed in terrestrial laboratory experiments or incorporated into the Standard Model of particle physics. Of these features, dark matter is currently the subject of most active laboratory investigations. Remaining issues include the cuspy halo problem and the dwarf galaxy problem of cold dark matter. Dark energy is also an area of intense interest for scientists, but it is not clear whether direct detection of dark energy will be possible. Inflation and baryogenesis remain more speculative features of current Big Bang models. Viable, quantitative explanations for such phenomena are still being sought. These are unsolved problems in physics.

===Hubble&#x27;s law and the expansion of the universe===

Observations of distant galaxies and quasars show that these objects are redshifted: the light emitted from them has been shifted to longer wavelengths. This can be seen by taking a frequency spectrum of an object and matching the spectroscopic pattern of emission or absorption lines corresponding to atoms of the chemical elements interacting with the light. These redshifts are uniformly isotropic, distributed evenly among the observed objects in all directions. If the redshift is interpreted as a Doppler shift, the recessional velocity of the object can be calculated. For some galaxies, it is possible to estimate distances via the cosmic distance ladder. When the recessional velocities are plotted against these distances, a linear relationship known as Hubble&#x27;s law is observed:
formula_1
where
* formula_2 is the recessional velocity of the galaxy or other distant object,
* formula_3 is the proper distance to the object, and
* formula_4 is Hubble&#x27;s constant, measured to be km/s/Mpc by the WMAP.

Hubble&#x27;s law implies that the universe is uniformly expanding everywhere. This cosmic expansion was predicted from general relativity by Friedmann in 1922 and Lemaître in 1927, well before Hubble made his 1929 analysis and observations, and it remains the cornerstone of the Big Bang model as developed by Friedmann, Lemaître, Robertson, and Walker.

The theory requires the relation formula_5 to hold at all times, where formula_3 is the proper distance, formula_2 is the recessional velocity, and formula_2, formula_9, and formula_3 vary as the universe expands (hence we write formula_4 to denote the present-day Hubble &quot;constant&quot;). For distances much smaller than the size of the observable universe, the Hubble redshift can be thought of as the Doppler shift corresponding to the recession velocity formula_2. For distances comparable to the size of the observable universe, the attribution of the cosmological redshift becomes more ambiguous, although its interpretation as a kinematic Doppler shift remains the most natural one.

An unexplained discrepancy with the determination of the Hubble constant is known as Hubble tension. Techniques based on observation of the CMB suggest a lower value of this constant compared to the quantity derived from measurements based on the cosmic distance ladder.

===Cosmic microwave background radiation===

In 1964, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson serendipitously discovered the cosmic background radiation, an omnidirectional signal in the microwave band. Their discovery provided substantial confirmation of the big-bang predictions by Alpher, Herman and Gamow around 1950. Through the 1970s, the radiation was found to be approximately consistent with a blackbody spectrum in all directions; this spectrum has been redshifted by the expansion of the universe, and today corresponds to approximately 2.725 K. This tipped the balance of evidence in favor of the Big Bang model, and Penzias and Wilson were awarded the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physics.

The &quot;surface of last scattering&quot; corresponding to emission of the CMB occurs shortly after &quot;recombination&quot;, the epoch when neutral hydrogen becomes stable. Prior to this, the universe comprised a hot dense photon-baryon plasma sea where photons were quickly scattered from free charged particles. Peaking at around , the mean free path for a photon becomes long enough to reach the present day and the universe becomes transparent.

In 1989, NASA launched COBE, which made two major advances: in 1990, high-precision spectrum measurements showed that the CMB frequency spectrum is an almost perfect blackbody with no deviations at a level of 1 part in 104, and measured a residual temperature of 2.726 K (more recent measurements have revised this figure down slightly to 2.7255 K); then in 1992, further COBE measurements discovered tiny fluctuations (anisotropies) in the CMB temperature across the sky, at a level of about one part in 105. John C. Mather and George Smoot were awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physics for their leadership in these results.

During the following decade, CMB anisotropies were further investigated by a large number of ground-based and balloon experiments. In 2000–2001, several experiments, most notably BOOMERanG, found the shape of the universe to be spatially almost flat by measuring the typical angular size (the size on the sky) of the anisotropies.

In early 2003, the first results of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe were released, yielding what were at the time the most accurate values for some of the cosmological parameters. The results disproved several specific cosmic inflation models, but are consistent with the inflation theory in general. The &quot;Planck&quot; space probe was launched in May 2009. Other ground and balloon-based cosmic microwave background experiments are ongoing.

===Abundance of primordial elements===
Using Big Bang models, it is possible to calculate the expected concentration of the isotopes helium-4 (4He), helium-3 (3He), deuterium (2H), and lithium-7 (7Li) in the universe as ratios to the amount of ordinary hydrogen. The relative abundances depend on a single parameter, the ratio of photons to baryons. This value can be calculated independently from the detailed structure of CMB fluctuations. The ratios predicted (by mass, not by abundance) are about 0.25 for 4He:H, about 10−3 for 2H:H, about 10−4 for 3He:H, and about 10−9 for 7Li:H.

The measured abundances all agree at least roughly with those predicted from a single value of the baryon-to-photon ratio. The agreement is excellent for deuterium, close but formally discrepant for 4He, and off by a factor of two for 7Li (this anomaly is known as the cosmological lithium problem); in the latter two cases, there are substantial systematic uncertainties. Nonetheless, the general consistency with abundances predicted by BBN is strong evidence for the Big Bang, as the theory is the only known explanation for the relative abundances of light elements, and it is virtually impossible to &quot;tune&quot; the Big Bang to produce much more or less than 20–30% helium. Indeed, there is no obvious reason outside of the Big Bang that, for example, the young universe before star formation, as determined by studying matter supposedly free of stellar nucleosynthesis products, should have more helium than deuterium or more deuterium than 3He, and in constant ratios, too.

===Galactic evolution and distribution===

Detailed observations of the morphology and distribution of galaxies and quasars are in agreement with the current Big Bang models. A combination of observations and theory suggest that the first quasars and galaxies formed within a billion years after the Big Bang, and since then, larger structures have been forming, such as galaxy clusters and superclusters.

Populations of stars have been aging and evolving, so that distant galaxies (which are observed as they were in the early universe) appear very different from nearby galaxies (observed in a more recent state). Moreover, galaxies that formed relatively recently appear markedly different from galaxies formed at similar distances but shortly after the Big Bang. These observations are strong arguments against the steady-state model. Observations of star formation, galaxy and quasar distributions and larger structures, agree well with Big Bang simulations of the formation of structure in the universe, and are helping to complete details of the theory.

=== Primordial gas clouds ===

In 2011, astronomers found what they believe to be pristine clouds of primordial gas by analyzing absorption lines in the spectra of distant quasars. Before this discovery, all other astronomical objects have been observed to contain heavy elements that are formed in stars. Despite being sensitive to carbon, oxygen, and silicon, these three elements were not detected in these two clouds. Since the clouds of gas have no detectable levels of heavy elements, they likely formed in the first few minutes after the Big Bang, during BBN.

===Other lines of evidence===
The age of the universe as estimated from the Hubble expansion and the CMB is now in agreement with other estimates using the ages of the oldest stars, both as measured by applying the theory of stellar evolution to globular clusters and through radiometric dating of individual Population II stars. It is also in agreement with age estimates based on measurements of the expansion using Type Ia supernovae and measurements of temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background. The agreement of independent measurements of this age supports the Lambda-CDM (ΛCDM) model, since the model is used to relate some of the measurements to an age estimate, and all estimates turn agree. Still, some observations of objects from the relatively early universe (in particular quasar APM 08279+5255) raise concern as to whether these objects had enough time to form so early in the ΛCDM model.

The prediction that the CMB temperature was higher in the past has been experimentally supported by observations of very low temperature absorption lines in gas clouds at high redshift. This prediction also implies that the amplitude of the Sunyaev–Zel&#x27;dovich effect in clusters of galaxies does not depend directly on redshift. Observations have found this to be roughly true, but this effect depends on cluster properties that do change with cosmic time, making precise measurements difficult.

===Future observations===
Future gravitational-wave observatories might be able to detect primordial gravitational waves, relics of the early universe, up to less than a second after the Big Bang.

==Problems and related issues in physics==

As with any theory, a number of mysteries and problems have arisen as a result of the development of the Big Bang models. Some of these mysteries and problems have been resolved while others are still outstanding. Proposed solutions to some of the problems in the Big Bang model have revealed new mysteries of their own. For example, the horizon problem, the magnetic monopole problem, and the flatness problem are most commonly resolved with inflation theory, but the details of the inflationary universe are still left unresolved and many, including some founders of the theory, say it has been disproven. What follows are a list of the mysterious aspects of the Big Bang concept still under intense investigation by cosmologists and astrophysicists.

===Baryon asymmetry===

It is not yet understood why the universe has more matter than antimatter. It is generally assumed that when the universe was young and very hot it was in statistical equilibrium and contained equal numbers of baryons and antibaryons. However, observations suggest that the universe, including its most distant parts, is made almost entirely of normal matter, rather than antimatter. A process called baryogenesis was hypothesized to account for the asymmetry. For baryogenesis to occur, the Sakharov conditions must be satisfied. These require that baryon number is not conserved, that C-symmetry and CP-symmetry are violated and that the universe depart from thermodynamic equilibrium. All these conditions occur in the Standard Model, but the effects are not strong enough to explain the present baryon asymmetry.

===Dark energy===

Measurements of the redshift–magnitude relation for type Ia supernovae indicate that the expansion of the universe has been accelerating since the universe was about half its present age. To explain this acceleration, general relativity requires that much of the energy in the universe consists of a component with large negative pressure, dubbed &quot;dark energy&quot;.

Dark energy, though speculative, solves numerous problems. Measurements of the cosmic microwave background indicate that the universe is very nearly spatially flat, and therefore according to general relativity the universe must have almost exactly the critical density of mass/energy. But the mass density of the universe can be measured from its gravitational clustering, and is found to have only about 30% of the critical density. Since theory suggests that dark energy does not cluster in the usual way it is the best explanation for the &quot;missing&quot; energy density. Dark energy also helps to explain two geometrical measures of the overall curvature of the universe, one using the frequency of gravitational lenses, and the other using the characteristic pattern of the large-scale structure--baryon acoustic oscillations--as a cosmic ruler.

Negative pressure is believed to be a property of vacuum energy, but the exact nature and existence of dark energy remains one of the great mysteries of the Big Bang. Results from the WMAP team in 2008 are in accordance with a universe that consists of 73% dark energy, 23% dark matter, 4.6% regular matter and less than 1% neutrinos. According to theory, the energy density in matter decreases with the expansion of the universe, but the dark energy density remains constant (or nearly so) as the universe expands. Therefore, matter made up a larger fraction of the total energy of the universe in the past than it does today, but its fractional contribution will fall in the far future as dark energy becomes even more dominant.

The dark energy component of the universe has been explained by theorists using a variety of competing theories including Einstein&#x27;s cosmological constant but also extending to more exotic forms of quintessence or other modified gravity schemes. A cosmological constant problem, sometimes called the &quot;most embarrassing problem in physics&quot;, results from the apparent discrepancy between the measured energy density of dark energy, and the one naively predicted from Planck units.

===Dark matter===
During the 1970s and the 1980s, various observations showed that there is not sufficient visible matter in the universe to account for the apparent strength of gravitational forces within and between galaxies. This led to the idea that up to 90% of the matter in the universe is dark matter that does not emit light or interact with normal baryonic matter. In addition, the assumption that the universe is mostly normal matter led to predictions that were strongly inconsistent with observations. In particular, the universe today is far more lumpy and contains far less deuterium than can be accounted for without dark matter. While dark matter has always been controversial, it is inferred by various observations: the anisotropies in the CMB, the galaxy rotation problem, galaxy cluster velocity dispersions, large-scale structure distributions, gravitational lensing studies, and X-ray measurements of galaxy clusters.

Indirect evidence for dark matter comes from its gravitational influence on other matter, as no dark matter particles have been observed in laboratories. Many particle physics candidates for dark matter have been proposed, and several projects to detect them directly are underway.

Additionally, there are outstanding problems associated with the currently favored cold dark matter model which include the dwarf galaxy problem and the cuspy halo problem. Alternative theories have been proposed that do not require a large amount of undetected matter, but instead modify the laws of gravity established by Newton and Einstein; yet no alternative theory has been as successful as the cold dark matter proposal in explaining all extant observations.

===Horizon problem===

The horizon problem results from the premise that information cannot travel faster than light. In a universe of finite age this sets a limit—the particle horizon—on the separation of any two regions of space that are in causal contact. The observed isotropy of the CMB is problematic in this regard: if the universe had been dominated by radiation or matter at all times up to the epoch of last scattering, the particle horizon at that time would correspond to about 2 degrees on the sky. There would then be no mechanism to cause wider regions to have the same temperature.

A resolution to this apparent inconsistency is offered by inflation theory in which a homogeneous and isotropic scalar energy field dominates the universe at some very early period (before baryogenesis). During inflation, the universe undergoes exponential expansion, and the particle horizon expands much more rapidly than previously assumed, so that regions presently on opposite sides of the observable universe are well inside each other&#x27;s particle horizon. The observed isotropy of the CMB then follows from the fact that this larger region was in causal contact before the beginning of inflation.

Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainty principle predicts that during the inflationary phase there would be quantum thermal fluctuations, which would be magnified to a cosmic scale. These fluctuations served as the seeds for all the current structures in the universe. Inflation predicts that the primordial fluctuations are nearly scale invariant and Gaussian, which has been confirmed by measurements of the CMB.

A related issue to the classic horizon problem arises because in most standard cosmological inflation models, inflation ceases well before electroweak symmetry breaking occurs, so inflation should not be able to prevent large-scale discontinuities in the electroweak vacuum since distant parts of the observable universe were causally separate when the electroweak epoch ended.

===Magnetic monopoles===
The magnetic monopole objection was raised in the late 1970s. Grand unified theories (GUTs) predicted topological defects in space that would manifest as magnetic monopoles. These objects would be produced efficiently in the hot early universe, resulting in a density much higher than is consistent with observations, given that no monopoles have been found. This problem is resolved by cosmic inflation, which removes all point defects from the observable universe, in the same way that it drives the geometry to flatness.

===Flatness problem===
The flatness problem (also known as the oldness problem) is an observational problem associated with a FLRW. The universe may have positive, negative, or zero spatial curvature depending on its total energy density. Curvature is negative if its density is less than the critical density; positive if greater; and zero at the critical density, in which case space is said to be &quot;flat&quot;. Observations indicate the universe is consistent with being flat.

The problem is that any small departure from the critical density grows with time, and yet the universe today remains very close to flat. Given that a natural timescale for departure from flatness might be the Planck time, 10−43 seconds, the fact that the universe has reached neither a heat death nor a Big Crunch after billions of years requires an explanation. For instance, even at the relatively late age of a few minutes (the time of nucleosynthesis), the density of the universe must have been within one part in 1014 of its critical value, or it would not exist as it does today.

== Misconceptions ==
One of the common misconceptions about the Big Bang model is that it fully explains the origin of the universe. However, the Big Bang model does not describe how energy, time, and space were caused, but rather it describes the emergence of the present universe from an ultra-dense and high-temperature initial state. It is misleading to visualize the Big Bang by comparing its size to everyday objects. When the size of the universe at Big Bang is described, it refers to the size of the observable universe, and not the entire universe.

Another common misconception is that the Big Bang must be understood as the expansion of space and not in terms of the contents of space exploding apart. In fact, either description can be accurate. The expansion of space (implied by the FLRW metric) is only a mathematical convention, corresponding to a choice of coordinates on spacetime. There is no generally covariant sense in which space expands.

The recession speeds associated with Hubble&#x27;s law are not velocities in a relativistic sense (for example, they are not related to the spatial components of 4-velocities). Therefore, it is not remarkable that according to Hubble&#x27;s law, galaxies farther than the Hubble distance recede faster than the speed of light. Such recession speeds do not correspond to faster-than-light travel.

Many popular accounts attribute the cosmological redshift to the expansion of space. This can be misleading because the expansion of space is only a coordinate choice. The most natural interpretation of the cosmological redshift is that it is a Doppler shift.

== Implications ==
Given current understanding, scientific extrapolations about the future of the universe are only possible for finite durations, albeit for much longer periods than the current age of the universe. Anything beyond that becomes increasingly speculative. Likewise, at present, a proper understanding of the origin of the universe can only be subject to conjecture.

=== Pre–Big Bang cosmology ===
The Big Bang explains the evolution of the universe from a starting density and temperature that is well beyond humanity&#x27;s capability to replicate, so extrapolations to the most extreme conditions and earliest times are necessarily more speculative. Lemaître called this initial state the &quot;&quot;primeval atom&quot; while Gamow called the material &quot;ylem&quot;&quot;. How the initial state of the universe originated is still an open question, but the Big Bang model does constrain some of its characteristics. For example, if specific laws of nature were to come to existence in a random way, inflation models show, some combinations of these are far more probable, partly explaining why our Universe is rather stable. Another possible explanation for the stability of the Universe could be a hypothetical multiverse, which assumes every possible universe to exist, and thinking species could only emerge in those stable enough. A flat universe implies a balance between gravitational potential energy and other energy forms, requiring no additional energy to be created.

The Big Bang theory is built upon the equations of classical general relativity, which are not expected to be valid at the origin of cosmic time, as the temperature of the universe approaches the Planck scale. Correcting this will require the development of a correct treatment of quantum gravity. Certain quantum gravity treatments, such as the Wheeler–DeWitt equation, imply that time itself could be an emergent property. As such, physics may conclude that time did not exist before the Big Bang.

While it is not known what could have preceded the hot dense state of the early universe or how and why it originated, or even whether such questions are sensible, speculation abounds on the subject of &quot;cosmogony&quot;.

Some speculative proposals in this regard, each of which entails untested hypotheses, are:
* The simplest models, in which the Big Bang was caused by quantum fluctuations. That scenario had very little chance of happening, but, according to the totalitarian principle, even the most improbable event will eventually happen. It took place instantly, in our perspective, due to the absence of perceived time before the Big Bang.
* Emergent Universe models, which feature a low-activity past-eternal era before the Big Bang, resembling ancient ideas of a cosmic egg and birth of the world out of primordial chaos.
* Models in which the whole of spacetime is finite, including the Hartle–Hawking no-boundary condition. For these cases, the Big Bang does represent the limit of time but without a singularity. In such a case, the universe is self-sufficient.
* Brane cosmology models, in which inflation is due to the movement of branes in string theory; the pre-Big Bang model; the ekpyrotic model, in which the Big Bang is the result of a collision between branes; and the cyclic model, a variant of the ekpyrotic model in which collisions occur periodically. In the latter model the Big Bang was preceded by a Big Crunch and the universe cycles from one process to the other.
* Eternal inflation, in which universal inflation ends locally here and there in a random fashion, each end-point leading to a &quot;bubble universe&quot;, expanding from its own big bang. This is sometimes referred to as pre-big bang inflation.

Proposals in the last two categories see the Big Bang as an event in either a much larger and older universe or in a multiverse.

=== Ultimate fate of the universe ===

Before observations of dark energy, cosmologists considered two scenarios for the future of the universe. If the mass density of the universe were greater than the critical density, then the universe would reach a maximum size and then begin to collapse. It would become denser and hotter again, ending with a state similar to that in which it started—a Big Crunch.

Alternatively, if the density in the universe were equal to or below the critical density, the expansion would slow down but never stop. Star formation would cease with the consumption of interstellar gas in each galaxy; stars would burn out, leaving white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Collisions between these would result in mass accumulating into larger and larger black holes. The average temperature of the universe would very gradually asymptotically approach absolute zero—a Big Freeze. Moreover, if protons are unstable, then baryonic matter would disappear, leaving only radiation and black holes. Eventually, black holes would evaporate by emitting Hawking radiation. The entropy of the universe would increase to the point where no organized form of energy could be extracted from it, a scenario known as heat death.

Modern observations of accelerating expansion imply that more and more of the currently visible universe will pass beyond our event horizon and out of contact with us. The eventual result is not known. The ΛCDM model of the universe contains dark energy in the form of a cosmological constant. This theory suggests that only gravitationally bound systems, such as galaxies, will remain together, and they too will be subject to heat death as the universe expands and cools. Other explanations of dark energy, called phantom energy theories, suggest that ultimately galaxy clusters, stars, planets, atoms, nuclei, and matter itself will be torn apart by the ever-increasing expansion in a so-called Big Rip.

===Religious and philosophical interpretations===
As a description of the origin of the universe, the Big Bang has significant bearing on religion and philosophy. As a result, it has become one of the liveliest areas in the discourse between science and religion. Some believe the Big Bang implies a creator, while others argue that Big Bang cosmology makes the notion of a creator superfluous.

<text>Bock () is a strong German beer, usually a dark lager.

==History==
The style now known as &quot;Bock&quot; was first brewed in the 14th century in the Hanseatic town of Einbeck in Lower Saxony.

The style was later adopted in Bavaria by Munich brewers in the 17th century. Due to their Bavarian accent, citizens of Munich pronounced &quot;Einbeck&quot; as &quot;ein Bock&quot; (&quot;a billy goat&quot;), and thus the beer became known as &quot;Bock&quot;. A goat often appears on bottle labels.

Bock is historically associated with special occasions, often religious festivals such as Christmas, Easter, or Lent (&quot;&quot;). Bock has a long history of being brewed and consumed by Bavarian monks as a source of nutrition during times of fasting.

==Styles==
Substyles of Bock include:

*Maibock (&quot;May Bock&quot;), a paler, more hopped version generally made for consumption at spring festivals. Due to its lighter colour, it is also referred to as Heller Bock; from German &quot;hell&quot; (bright, light in colour).
*Doppelbock (&quot;Double Bock&quot;), a stronger and maltier version
*Eisbock (&quot;Ice Bock&quot;), a much stronger version made by partially freezing the beer and removing the ice that forms
*Weizenbock (&quot;Wheat Bock&quot;), a wheat beer made from 40 to 60% wheat

Traditionally Bock is a sweet, relatively strong (6.3–7.6% by volume), lightly hopped lager registering between 20 and 30 International Bitterness Units (IBUs). The beer should be clear, with colour ranging from light copper to brown, and a bountiful, persistent off-white head. The aroma should be malty and toasty, possibly with hints of alcohol, but no detectable hops or fruitiness. The mouthfeel is smooth, with low to moderate carbonation and no astringency. The taste is rich and toasty, sometimes with a bit of caramel. The low-to-undetectable presence of hops provides just enough bitterness so that the sweetness is not cloying and the aftertaste is muted.

===Maibock===
The Maibock style – also known as Heller Bock or Lente Bock in the Netherlandsis a strong pale lager, lighter in colour and with more hop presence.

Colour can range from deep gold to light amber with a large, creamy, persistent white head, and moderate to moderately high carbonation, while alcohol content ranges from 6.3% to 8.1% by volume. The flavour is typically less malty than a traditional Bock, and may be drier, hoppier, and more bitter, but still with a relatively low hop flavour, with a mild spicy or peppery quality from the hops, increased carbonation and alcohol content.

===Doppelbock===
&quot;Doppelbock&quot; or &quot;Double Bock&quot; is a stronger version of traditional Bock that was first brewed in Munich by the Paulaner Friars, a Franciscan order founded by St. Francis of Paula.

Historically, Doppelbock was high in alcohol and sweetness. The story is told that it served as &quot;liquid bread&quot; for the Friars during times of fasting when solid food was not permitted. However, historian Mark Dredge, in his book &quot;A Brief History of Lager&quot;, says that this story is myth and that the monks produced Doppelbock to supplement their order&#x27;s vegetarian diet all year.

Today, Doppelbock is still strongranging from 7% to 12% or more by volume. It is clear, with colour ranging from dark gold, for the paler version, to dark brown with ruby highlights for a darker version. It has a large, creamy, persistent head (although head retention may be impaired by alcohol in the stronger versions). The aroma is intensely malty, with some toasty notes, and possibly some alcohol presence as well; darker versions may have a chocolate-like or fruity aroma. The flavour is very rich and malty, with noticeable alcoholic strength, and little or no detectable hops (16–26 IBUs).

Paler versions may have a drier finish. The monks who originally brewed Doppelbock named their beer &quot;Salvator&quot; (literally &quot;Savior&quot;, but actually a malapropism for &quot;Sankt Vater&quot;, &quot;St. Father&quot;, originally brewed for the feast of St. Francis of Paola on 2 April which often falls in Lent), which today is trademarked by Paulaner.

Brewers of modern Doppelbock often add &quot;&quot; to their beer&#x27;s name as a signpost of the style; there are 200 &quot;-ator&quot; Doppelbock names registered with the German patent office.

The following are representative examples of the style: Paulaner Salvator, Ayinger Celebrator, Weihenstephaner Korbinian, Andechser Doppelbock Dunkel, Spaten Optimator, Augustiner Brau Maximator, Tucher Bajuvator, Weltenburger Kloster Asam-Bock, Capital Autumnal Fire, EKU 28, Eggenberg Urbock 23º, Bell&#x27;s Consecrator, Moretti La Rossa, Samuel Adams Double Bock, Tröegs Tröegenator Double Bock, Wasatch Brewery Devastator, Great Lakes Doppelrock, Abita Andygator, Wolverine State Brewing Company Predator, Burly Brewing&#x27;s Burlynator, Monteith&#x27;s Doppel Bock, and Christian Moerlein Emancipator Doppelbock.

===Eisbock===
Eisbock is a traditional specialty beer of the Kulmbach district of Bavaria, made by partially freezing a Doppelbock and removing the water ice to concentrate the flavour and alcohol content, which ranges from 8.6% to 14.3% by volume.

It is clear, with a colour ranging from deep copper to dark brown in colour, often with ruby highlights. Although it can pour with a thin off-white head, head retention is frequently impaired by the higher alcohol content. The aroma is intense, with no hop presence, but frequently can contain fruity notes, especially of prunes, raisins, and plums. Mouthfeel is full and smooth, with significant alcohol, although this should not be hot or sharp. The flavour is rich and sweet, often with toasty notes, and sometimes hints of chocolate, always balanced by a significant alcohol presence.

The following are representative examples of the style: Colorado Team Brew &quot;Warning Sign&quot;, Kulmbacher Reichelbräu Eisbock, Eggenberg, Schneider Aventinus Eisbock, Urbock Dunkel Eisbock, Franconia Brewing Company Ice Bock 17%.

The strongest ice beer, Strength in Numbers, was a one-time collaboration in 2020 between Schorschbrau of Germany and BrewDog of Scotland, who had competed with each other in the early years of the 21st century to produce the world&#x27;s strongest beer. &quot;Strength in Numbers&quot; was created using traditional ice distillation, reaching a final strength of 57.8% ABV.

===Weizenbock===
Weizenbock is a style that replaces some of the barley in the grain bill with 40–60% wheat. It was first produced in Bavaria in 1907 by G. Schneider &amp; Sohn and was named &quot;Aventinus&quot; after 16th-century Bavarian historian Johannes Aventinus. The style combines darker Munich malts and top-fermenting wheat beer yeast, brewed at the strength of a Doppelbock.
