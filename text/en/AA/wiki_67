<text>Braille ( , ) is a tactile writing system used by people who are visually impaired. It can be read either on embossed paper or by using refreshable braille displays that connect to computers and smartphone devices. Braille can be written using a slate and stylus, a braille writer, an electronic braille notetaker or with the use of a computer connected to a braille embosser.
Braille is named after its creator, Louis Braille, a Frenchman who lost his sight as a result of a childhood accident. In 1824, at the age of fifteen, he developed the braille code based on the French alphabet as an improvement on night writing. He published his system, which subsequently included musical notation, in 1829. The second revision, published in 1837, was the first binary form of writing developed in the modern era.

Braille characters are formed using a combination of six raised dots arranged in a 3 × 2 matrix, called the braille cell. The number and arrangement of these dots distinguishes one character from another. Since the various braille alphabets originated as transcription codes for printed writing, the mappings (sets of character designations) vary from language to language, and even within one; in English braille there are three levels: &quot;uncontracted&quot;a letter-by-letter transcription used for basic literacy; &quot;contracted&quot;an addition of abbreviations and contractions used as a space-saving mechanism; and &quot;grade 3&quot; various non-standardized personal stenographies that are less commonly used.

In addition to braille text (letters, punctuation, contractions), it is also possible to create embossed illustrations and graphs, with the lines either solid or made of series of dots, arrows, and bullets that are larger than braille dots. A full braille cell includes six raised dots arranged in two columns, each column having three dots. The dot positions are identified by numbers from one to six. There are 64 possible combinations, including no dots at all for a word space. Dot configurations can be used to represent a letter, digit, punctuation mark, or even a word.

Early braille education is crucial to literacy, education and employment among the blind. Despite the evolution of new technologies, including screen reader software that reads information aloud, braille provides blind people with access to spelling, punctuation and other aspects of written language less accessible through audio alone.

While some have suggested that audio-based technologies will decrease the need for braille, technological advancements such as braille displays have continued to make braille more accessible and available. Braille users highlight that braille remains as essential as print is to the sighted.

== History ==
Braille was based on a tactile code, now known as night writing, developed by Charles Barbier. (The name &quot;night writing&quot; was later given to it when it was considered as a means for soldiers to communicate silently at night and without a light source, but Barbier&#x27;s writings do not use this term and suggest that it was originally designed as a simpler form of writing and for the visually impaired.) In Barbier&#x27;s system, sets of 12 embossed dots were used to encode 36 different sounds. Braille identified three major defects of the code: first, the symbols represented phonetic sounds and not letters of the alphabetthus the code was unable to render the orthography of the words. Second, the 12-dot symbols could not easily fit beneath the pad of the reading finger. This required the reading finger to move in order to perceive the whole symbol, which slowed the reading process. (This was because Barbier&#x27;s system was based only on the number of dots in each of two 6-dot columns, not the pattern of the dots.) Third, the code did not include symbols for numerals or punctuation. Braille&#x27;s solution was to use 6-dot cells and to assign a specific pattern to each letter of the alphabet. Braille also developed symbols for representing numerals and punctuation.

At first, braille was a one-to-one transliteration of the French alphabet, but soon various abbreviations (contractions) and even logograms were developed, creating a system much more like shorthand.

Today, there are braille codes for over 133 languages.

In English, some variations in the braille codes have traditionally existed among English-speaking countries. In 1991, work to standardize the braille codes used in the English-speaking world began. Unified English Braille (UEB) has been adopted in all seven member countries of the International Council on English Braille (ICEB) as well as Nigeria.

For blind readers, braille is an independent writing system, rather than a code of printed orthography.

=== Derivation ===
Braille is derived from the Latin alphabet, albeit indirectly. In Braille&#x27;s original system, the dot patterns were assigned to letters according to their position within the alphabetic order of the French alphabet of the time, with accented letters and &quot;w&quot; sorted at the end.

Unlike print, which consists of mostly arbitrary symbols, the braille alphabet follows a logical sequence. The first ten letters of the alphabet, &quot;a&quot;–&quot;j&quot;, use the upper four dot positions: (black dots in the table below). These stand for the ten digits &quot;1&quot;–&quot;9&quot; and &quot;0&quot; in an alphabetic numeral system similar to Greek numerals (as well as derivations of it, including Hebrew numerals, Cyrillic numerals, Abjad numerals, also Hebrew gematria and Greek isopsephy).

Though the dots are assigned in no obvious order, the cells with the fewest dots are assigned to the first three letters (and lowest digits), &quot;abc&quot; = &quot;123&quot; (), and to the three vowels in this part of the alphabet, &quot;aei&quot; (), whereas the even digits &quot;4&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;8&quot;, &quot;0&quot; () are right angles.

The next ten letters, &quot;k&quot;–&quot;t&quot;, are identical to &quot;a&quot;–&quot;j&quot; respectively, apart from the addition of a dot at position 3 (red dots in the bottom left corners of the cells in the table below): :

The next ten letters (the next &quot;&quot;) are the same again, but with dots also at both position 3 and position 6 (green dots in the bottom rows of the cells in the table above). Here &quot;w&quot; was left out as it was not part of the official French alphabet in Braille&#x27;s time; the French order of the decade was &quot;u v x y z ç é à è ù&quot; ().

The next ten letters, ending in &quot;w&quot;, are the same again, except that for this series position 6 (purple dot in the bottom right corner of the cell in the table above) is used without a dot at position 3. In French braille these are the letters &quot;â ê î ô û ë ï ü œ w&quot; (). &quot;W&quot; had been tacked onto the end of 39 letters of the French alphabet to accommodate English.

The &quot;a&quot;–&quot;j&quot; series shifted down by one dot space () is used for punctuation. Letters &quot;a&quot; and &quot;c&quot; , which only use dots in the top row, were shifted two places for the apostrophe and hyphen: . (These are also the decade diacritics, on the left in the table below, of the second and third decade.)

In addition, there are ten patterns that are based on the first two letters () with their dots shifted to the right; these were assigned to non-French letters (&quot;ì ä ò&quot; ), or serve non-letter functions: (superscript; in English the accent mark), (currency prefix), (capital, in English the decimal point), (number sign), (emphasis mark), (symbol prefix).

The first four decades are similar in that the numeric sequence is extended by adding the decade dots, whereas in the fifth decade it is extended by shifting it downward.

Originally there had been nine decades. The fifth through ninth used dashes as well as dots, but they proved to be impractical to distinguish by touch under normal conditions and were soon abandoned. From the beginning, these additional decades could be substituted with what we now know as the number sign () applied to the earlier decades, though that only caught on for the digits (the old 5th decade being replaced by applied to the 1st decade). The dash occupying the top row of the original sixth decade was simply omitted, producing the modern fifth decade. (See 1829 braille.)

=== Assignment ===
Historically, there have been three principles in assigning the values of a linear script (print) to Braille: Using Louis Braille&#x27;s original French letter values; reassigning the braille letters according to the sort order of the print alphabet being transcribed; and reassigning the letters to improve the efficiency of writing in braille.

Under international consensus, most braille alphabets follow the French sorting order for the 26 letters of the basic Latin alphabet, and there have been attempts at unifying the letters beyond these 26 (see international braille), though differences remain, for example, in German Braille. This unification avoids the chaos of each nation reordering the braille code to match the sorting order of its print alphabet, as happened in Algerian Braille, where braille codes were numerically reassigned to match the order of the Arabic alphabet and bear little relation to the values used in other countries (compare modern Arabic Braille, which uses the French sorting order), and as happened in an early American version of English Braille, where the letters &quot;w&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot; were reassigned to match English alphabetical order. A convention sometimes seen for letters beyond the basic 26 is to exploit the physical symmetry of braille patterns iconically, for example, by assigning a reversed &quot;n&quot; to &quot;ñ&quot; or an inverted &quot;s&quot; to &quot;sh&quot;. (See Hungarian Braille and Bharati Braille, which do this to some extent.)

A third principle was to assign braille codes according to frequency, with the simplest patterns (quickest ones to write with a stylus) assigned to the most frequent letters of the alphabet. Such frequency-based alphabets were used in Germany and the United States in the 19th century (see American Braille), but with the invention of the braille typewriter their advantage disappeared, and none are attested in modern use they had the disadvantage that the resulting small number of dots in a text interfered with following the alignment of the letters, and consequently made texts more difficult to read than Braille&#x27;s more arbitrary letter assignment. Finally, there are braille scripts that do not order the codes numerically at all, such as Japanese Braille and Korean Braille, which are based on more abstract principles of syllable composition.

Texts are sometimes written in a script of eight dots per cell rather than six, enabling them to encode a greater number of symbols. (See Gardner–Salinas braille codes.) Luxembourgish Braille has adopted eight-dot cells for general use; for example, accented letters take the unaccented versions plus dot 8.

== Form ==

Braille was the first writing system with binary encoding. The system as devised by Braille consists of two parts:
# Character encoding that mapped characters of the French alphabet to tuples of six bits (the dots).
# The physical representation of those six-bit characters with raised dots in a braille cell.

Within an individual cell, the dot positions are arranged in two columns of three positions. A raised dot can appear in any of the six positions, producing 64 (26) possible patterns, including one in which there are no raised dots. For reference purposes, a pattern is commonly described by listing the positions where dots are raised, the positions being universally numbered, from top to bottom, as 1 to 3 on the left and 4 to 6 on the right. For example, dot pattern 1-3-4 describes a cell with three dots raised, at the top and bottom in the left column and at the top of the right column: that is, the letter &quot;m&quot;. The lines of horizontal braille text are separated by a space, much like visible printed text, so that the dots of one line can be differentiated from the braille text above and below. Different assignments of braille codes (or code pages) are used to map the character sets of different printed scripts to the six-bit cells. Braille assignments have also been created for mathematical and musical notation. However, because the six-dot braille cell allows only 64 (26) patterns, including space, the characters of a braille script commonly have multiple values, depending on their context. That is, character mapping between print and braille is not one-to-one. For example, the character corresponds in print to both the letter &quot;d&quot; and the digit &quot;4&quot;.

In addition to simple encoding, many braille alphabets use contractions to reduce the size of braille texts and to increase reading speed. (See Contracted braille.)

== Writing braille ==
Braille may be produced by hand using a slate and stylus in which each dot is created from the back of the page, writing in mirror image, or it may be produced on a braille typewriter or Perkins Brailler, or an electronic Brailler or braille notetaker. Braille users with access to smartphones may also activate the on-screen braille input keyboard, to type braille symbols on to their device by placing their fingers on to the screen according to the dot configuration of the symbols they wish to form. These symbols are automatically translated into print on the screen. The different tools that exist for writing braille allow the braille user to select the method that is best for a given task. For example, the slate and stylus is a portable writing tool, much like the pen and paper for the sighted. Errors can be erased using a braille eraser or can be overwritten with all six dots (). &quot;Interpoint&quot; refers to braille printing that is offset, so that the paper can be embossed on both sides, with the dots on one side appearing between the divots that form the dots on the other.
Using a computer or other electronic device, Braille may be produced with a braille embosser (printer) or a refreshable braille display (screen).

=== Eight-dot braille ===
Braille has been extended to an 8-dot code, particularly for use with braille embossers and refreshable braille displays. In 8-dot braille the additional dots are added at the bottom of the cell, giving a matrix 4 dots high by 2 dots wide. The additional dots are given the numbers 7 (for the lower-left dot) and 8 (for the lower-right dot). Eight-dot braille has the advantages that the casing of each letter is coded in the cell and that every printable ASCII character can be encoded in a single cell. All 256 (28) possible combinations of 8 dots are encoded by the Unicode standard. Braille with six dots is frequently stored as Braille ASCII.

=== Letters ===
The first 25 braille letters, up through the first half of the 3rd decade, transcribe &quot;a–z&quot; (skipping &quot;w&quot;). In English Braille, the rest of that decade is rounded out with the ligatures &quot;and, for, of, the,&quot; and &quot;with&quot;. Omitting dot 3 from these forms the 4th decade, the ligatures &quot;ch, gh, sh, th, wh, ed, er, ou, ow&quot; and the letter &quot;w&quot;.
(See English Braille.)

=== Formatting ===
Various formatting marks affect the values of the letters that follow them. They have no direct equivalent in print. The most important in English Braille are:
That is, is read as capital &#x27;A&#x27;, and as the digit &#x27;1&#x27;.

=== Punctuation ===
Basic punctuation marks in English Braille include:

 is both the question mark and the opening quotation mark. Its reading depends on whether it occurs before a word or after.

 is used for both opening and closing parentheses. Its placement relative to spaces and other characters determines its interpretation.

Punctuation varies from language to language. For example, French Braille uses for its question mark and swaps the quotation marks and parentheses (to and ); it uses () for both the period and the decimal point, and the English decimal point () to mark capitalization.

=== Contractions ===
Braille contractions are words and affixes that are shortened so that they take up fewer cells. In English Braille, for example, the word &quot;afternoon&quot; is written with just three letters, , much like stenoscript. There are also several abbreviation marks that create what are effectively logograms. The most common of these is dot 5, which combines with the first letter of words. With the letter &quot;m&quot;, the resulting word is &quot;mother&quot;. There are also ligatures (&quot;contracted&quot; letters), which are single letters in braille but correspond to more than one letter in print. The letter &quot;and&quot;, for example, is used to write words with the sequence &quot;a-n-d&quot; in them, such as &quot;grand&quot;.

=== Page dimensions ===
Most braille embossers support between 34 and 40 cells per line, and 25 lines per page.

A manually operated Perkins braille typewriter supports a maximum of 42 cells per line (its margins are adjustable), and typical paper allows 25 lines per page.

A large interlining Stainsby has 36 cells per line and 18 lines per page.

An A4-sized Marburg braille frame, which allows interpoint braille (dots on both sides of the page, offset so they do not interfere with each other), has 30 cells per line and 27 lines per page.

=== Braille writing machine ===
A Braille writing machine is a typewriter with six keys that allows the user to write braille on a regular hard copy page.

The first Braille typewriter to gain general acceptance was invented by Frank Haven Hall (Superintendent of the Illinois School for the Blind), and was presented to the public in 1892.

The Stainsby Brailler, developed by Henry Stainsby in 1903, is a mechanical writer with a sliding carriage that moves over an aluminium plate as it embosses Braille characters. An improved version was introduced around 1933.

In 1951 David Abraham, a woodworking teacher at the Perkins School for the Blind, produced a more advanced Braille typewriter, the Perkins Brailler.

Braille printers or embossers were produced in the 1950s.
In 1960 Robert Mann, a teacher in MIT, wrote DOTSYS, a software that allowed automatic braille translation, and another group created an embossing device called &quot;M.I.T. Braillemboss&quot;. The Mitre Corporation team of Robert Gildea, Jonathan Millen, Reid Gerhart and Joseph Sullivan (now president of Duxbury Systems) developed DOTSYS III, the first braille translator written in a portable programming language. DOTSYS III was developed for the Atlanta Public Schools as a public domain program.

In 1991 Ernest Bate developed the Mountbatten Brailler, an electronic machine used to type braille on braille paper, giving it a number of additional features such as word processing, audio feedback and embossing. This version was improved in 2008 with a quiet writer that had an erase key.

In 2011 David S. Morgan produced the first SMART Brailler machine, with added text to speech function and allowed digital capture of data entered.

== Braille reading ==

Braille is traditionally read in hardcopy form, such as with paper books written in braille, documents produced in paper braille (such as restaurant menus), and braille labels or public signage. It can also be read on a refreshable braille display either as a stand-alone electronic device or connected to a computer or smartphone. Refreshable braille displays convert what is visually shown on a computer or smartphone screen into braille through a series of pins that rise and fall to form braille symbols. Currently more than 1% of all printed books have been translated into hardcopy braille.

The fastest braille readers apply a light touch and read braille with two hands, although reading braille with one hand is also possible. Although the finger can read only one braille character at a time, the brain chunks braille at a higher level, processing words a digraph, root or suffix at a time. The processing largely takes place in the visual cortex.

== Literacy ==
Children who are blind miss out on fundamental parts of early and advanced education if not provided with the necessary tools, such as access to educational materials in braille. Children who are blind or visually impaired can begin learning foundational braille skills from a very young age to become fluent braille readers as they get older. Sighted children are naturally exposed to written language on signs, on TV and in the books they see. Blind children require the same early exposure to literacy, through access to braille rich environments and opportunities to explore the world around them. Print-braille books, for example, present text in both print and braille and can be read by sighted parents to blind children (and vice versa), allowing blind children to develop an early love for reading even before formal reading instruction begins.

Adults who experience sight loss later in life or who did not have the opportunity to learn it when they were younger can also learn braille. In most cases, adults who learn braille were already literate in print before vision loss and so instruction focuses more on developing the tactile and motor skills needed to read braille.

While different countries publish statistics on how many readers in a given organization request braille, these numbers only provide a partial picture of braille literacy statistics. For example, this data does not survey the entire population of braille readers or always include readers who are no longer in the school system (adults) or readers who request electronic braille materials. Therefore, there are currently no reliable statistics on braille literacy rates, as described in a publication in the &quot;Journal of Visual Impairment and Blindness&quot;. Regardless of the precise percentage of braille readers, there is consensus that braille should be provided to all those who benefit from it.

Numerous factors influence access to braille literacy, including school budget constraints, technology advancements such as screen-reader software, access to qualified instruction, and different philosophical views over how blind children should be educated.

In the US, a key turning point for braille literacy was the passage of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, an act of Congress that moved thousands of children from specialized schools for the blind into mainstream public schools. Because only a small percentage of public schools could afford to train and hire braille-qualified teachers, braille literacy has declined since the law took effect. Braille literacy rates have improved slightly since the bill was passed, in part because of pressure from consumers and advocacy groups that has led 27 states to pass legislation mandating that children who are legally blind be given the opportunity to learn braille.

In 1998 there were 57,425 legally blind students registered in the United States, but only 10% (5,461) of them used braille as their primary reading medium.

Early Braille education is crucial to literacy for a blind or low-vision child. A study conducted in the state of Washington found that people who learned braille at an early age did just as well as, if not better than, their sighted peers in several areas, including vocabulary and comprehension. In the preliminary adult study, while evaluating the correlation between adult literacy skills and employment, it was found that 44% of the participants who had learned to read in braille were unemployed, compared to the 77% unemployment rate of those who had learned to read using print. Currently, among the estimated 85,000 blind adults in the United States, 90% of those who are braille-literate are employed. Among adults who do not know braille, only 33% are employed. Statistically, history has proven that braille reading proficiency provides an essential skill set that allows blind or low-vision children to compete with their sighted peers in a school environment and later in life as they enter the workforce.

Regardless of the specific percentage of braille readers, proponents point out the importance of increasing access to braille for all those who can benefit from it.

== Braille transcription ==
Although it is possible to transcribe print by simply substituting the equivalent braille character for its printed equivalent, in English such a character-by-character transcription (known as &quot;uncontracted braille&quot;) is typically used by beginners or those who only engage in short reading tasks (such as reading household labels).

Braille characters are much larger than their printed equivalents, and the standard page has room for only 25 lines of 43 characters. To reduce space and increase reading speed, most braille alphabets and orthographies use ligatures, abbreviations, and contractions. Virtually all English braille books in hardcopy (paper) format are transcribed in contracted braille: The Library of Congress&#x27;s &quot;Instruction Manual for Braille Transcribing&quot; runs to over 300 pages, and braille transcribers must pass certification tests.

Uncontracted braille was previously known as grade 1 braille, and contracted braille was previously known as grade 2 braille. Uncontracted braille is a direct transliteration of print words (one-to-one correspondence); hence, the word &quot;about&quot; would contain all the same letters in uncontracted braille as it does in inkprint. Contracted braille includes short forms to save space; hence, for example, the letters &quot;ab&quot; when standing alone represent the word &quot;about&quot; in English contracted braille. In English, some braille users only learn uncontracted braille, particularly if braille is being used for shorter reading tasks such as reading household labels. However, those who plan to use braille for educational and employment purposes and longer reading texts often go on to contracted braille.

The system of contractions in English Braille begins with a set of 23 words contracted to single characters. Thus the word &quot;but&quot; is contracted to the single letter &quot;b&quot;, &quot;can&quot; to &quot;c&quot;, &quot;do&quot; to &quot;d&quot;, and so on. Even this simple rule creates issues requiring special cases; for example, &quot;d&quot; is, specifically, an abbreviation of the verb &quot;do&quot;; the noun &quot;do&quot; representing the note of the musical scale is a different word and must be spelled out.

Portions of words may be contracted, and many rules govern this process. For example, the character with dots 2-3-5 (the letter &quot;f&quot; lowered in the Braille cell) stands for &quot;ff&quot; when used in the middle of a word. At the beginning of a word, this same character stands for the word &quot;to&quot;; the character is written in braille with no space following it. (This contraction was removed in the Unified English Braille Code.) At the end of a word, the same character represents an exclamation point.

Some contractions are more similar than their print equivalents. For example, the contraction , meaning &quot;letter&quot;, differs from , meaning &quot;little&quot;, only by one dot in the second letter: &quot;little&quot;, &quot;letter&quot;. This causes greater confusion between the braille spellings of these words and can hinder the learning process of contracted braille.

The contraction rules take into account the linguistic structure of the word; thus, contractions are generally not to be used when their use would alter the usual braille form of a base word to which a prefix or suffix has been added. Some portions of the transcription rules are not fully codified and rely on the judgment of the transcriber. Thus, when the contraction rules permit the same word in more than one way, preference is given to &quot;the contraction that more nearly approximates correct pronunciation&quot;.

&quot;Grade 3 braille&quot; is a variety of non-standardized systems that include many additional shorthand-like contractions. They are not used for publication, but by individuals for their personal convenience.

== Braille translation software ==
When people produce braille, this is called braille transcription. When computer software produces braille, this is called a braille translator. Braille translation software exists to handle almost all of the common languages of the world, and many technical areas, such as mathematics (mathematical notation), for example WIMATS, music (musical notation), and tactile graphics.

== Braille reading techniques ==
Since Braille is one of the few writing systems where tactile perception is used, as opposed to visual perception, a braille reader must develop new skills. One skill important for Braille readers is the ability to create smooth and even pressures when running one&#x27;s fingers along the words. There are many different styles and techniques used for the understanding and development of braille, even though a study by B. F. Holland suggests that there is no specific technique that is superior to any other.

Another study by Lowenfield &amp; Abel shows that braille can be read &quot;the fastest and best... by students who read using the index fingers of both hands&quot;. Another important reading skill emphasized in this study is to finish reading the end of a line with the right hand and to find the beginning of the next line with the left hand simultaneously.

== International uniformity ==


When Braille was first adapted to languages other than French, many schemes were adopted, including mapping the native alphabet to the alphabetical order of French – e.g. in English W, which was not in the French alphabet at the time, is mapped to braille X, X to Y, Y to Z, and Z to the first French-accented letter – or completely rearranging the alphabet such that common letters are represented by the simplest braille patterns. Consequently, mutual intelligibility was greatly hindered by this state of affairs. In 1878, the International Congress on Work for the Blind, held in Paris, proposed an international braille standard, where braille codes for different languages and scripts would be based, not on the order of a particular alphabet, but on phonetic correspondence and transliteration to Latin.

This unified braille has been applied to the languages of India and Africa, Arabic, Vietnamese, Hebrew, Russian, and Armenian, as well as nearly all Latin-script languages. In Greek, for example, γ (g) is written as Latin &quot;g&quot;, despite the fact that it has the alphabetic position of &quot;c&quot;; Hebrew ב (b), the second letter of the alphabet and cognate with the Latin letter &quot;b&quot;, is sometimes pronounced /b/ and sometimes /v/, and is written &quot;b&quot; or &quot;v&quot; accordingly; Russian ц (ts) is written as &quot;c&quot;, which is the usual letter for /ts/ in those Slavic languages that use the Latin alphabet; and Arabic ف (f) is written as &quot;f&quot;, despite being historically &quot;p&quot; and occurring in that part of the Arabic alphabet (between historic &quot;o&quot; and &quot;q&quot;).

== Other braille conventions ==

Other systems for assigning values to braille patterns are also followed beside the simple mapping of the alphabetical order onto the original French order. Some braille alphabets start with unified braille, and then diverge significantly based on the phonology of the target languages, while others diverge even further.

In the various Chinese systems, traditional braille values are used for initial consonants and the simple vowels. In both Mandarin and Cantonese Braille, however, characters have different readings depending on whether they are placed in syllable-initial (onset) or syllable-final (rime) position. For instance, the cell for Latin &quot;k&quot;, , represents Cantonese &quot;k&quot; (&quot;g&quot; in Yale and other modern romanizations) when initial, but &quot;aak&quot; when final, while Latin &quot;j&quot;, , represents Cantonese initial &quot;j&quot; but final &quot;oei&quot;.

Novel systems of braille mapping include Korean, which adopts separate syllable-initial and syllable-final forms for its consonants, explicitly grouping braille cells into syllabic groups in the same way as hangul. Japanese, meanwhile, combines independent vowel dot patterns and modifier consonant dot patterns into a single braille cell – an abugida representation of each Japanese mora.

== Uses ==

Braille is read by people who are blind, deafblind or who have low vision, and by both those born with a visual impairment and those who experience sight loss later in life. Braille may also be used by print impaired people, who although may be fully sighted, due to a physical disability are unable to read print. Even individuals with low vision will find that they benefit from braille, depending on level of vision or context (for example, when lighting or colour contrast is poor). Braille is used for both short and long reading tasks. Examples of short reading tasks include braille labels for identifying household items (or cards in a wallet), reading elevator buttons, accessing phone numbers, recipes, grocery lists and other personal notes. Examples of longer reading tasks include using braille to access educational materials, novels and magazines. People with access to a refreshable braille display can also use braille for reading email and ebooks, browsing the internet and accessing other electronic documents. It is also possible to adapt or purchase playing cards and board games in braille.

In India there are instances where the parliament acts have been published in braille, such as &quot;The Right to Information Act&quot;. Sylheti Braille is used in Northeast India.

In Canada, passenger safety information in braille and tactile seat row markers are required aboard planes, trains, large ferries, and interprovincial busses pursuant to the Canadian Transportation Agency&#x27;s regulations.

In the United States, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 requires various building signage to be in braille.

In the United Kingdom, it is required that medicines have the name of the medicine in Braille on the labeling.

=== Currency ===

The current series of Canadian banknotes has a tactile feature consisting of raised dots that indicate the denomination, allowing bills to be easily identified by blind or low vision people. It does not use standard braille numbers to identify the value. Instead, the number of full braille cells, which can be simply counted by both braille readers and non-braille readers alike, is an indicator of the value of the bill.

Mexican bank notes, Australian bank notes, Indian rupee notes, Israeli new shekel notes and Russian ruble notes also have special raised symbols to make them identifiable by persons who are blind or have low vision.

Euro coins were designed in cooperation with organisations representing blind people, and as a result they incorporate many features allowing them to be distinguished by touch alone. In addition, their visual appearance is designed to make them easy to tell apart for persons who cannot read the inscriptions on the coins. &quot;A good design for the blind and partially sighted is a good design for everybody&quot; was the principle behind the cooperation of the European Central Bank and the European Blind Union during the design phase of the first series Euro banknotes in the 1990s. As a result, the design of the first euro banknotes included several characteristics which aid both the blind and partially sighted to confidently use the notes.

Australia introduced the tactile feature onto their five-dollar banknote in 2016

In the United Kingdom, the front of the £10 polymer note (the side with raised print), has two clusters of raised dots in the top left hand corner, and the £20 note has three. This tactile feature helps blind and partially sighted people identify the value of the note.

In 2003 the US Mint introduced the commemorative Alabama State Quarter, which recognized State Daughter Helen Keller on the Obverse, including the name Helen Keller in both English script and Braille inscription. This appears to be the first known use of Braille on US Coin Currency, though not standard on all coins of this type.

== Unicode ==
The Braille set was added to the Unicode Standard in version 3.0 (1999).

Most braille embossers and refreshable braille displays do not use the Unicode code points, but instead reuse the 8-bit code points that are assigned to standard ASCII for braille ASCII. (Thus, for simple material, the same bitstream may be interpreted equally as visual letter forms for sighted readers or their exact semantic equivalent in tactile patterns for blind readers. However some codes have quite different tactile versus visual interpretations and most are not even defined in Braille ASCII.)

Some embossers have proprietary control codes for 8-dot braille or for full graphics mode, where dots may be placed anywhere on the page without leaving any space between braille cells so that continuous lines can be drawn in diagrams, but these are rarely used and are not standard.

The Unicode standard encodes 6-dot and 8-dot braille glyphs according to their binary appearance, rather than following their assigned numeric order. Dot 1 corresponds to the least significant bit of the low byte of the Unicode scalar value, and dot 8 to the high bit of that byte.

The Unicode block for braille is U+2800 ... U+28FF. The mapping of patterns to characters etc. is language dependent: even for English for example, see American Braille and English Braille.

== Observation ==
Every year on 4 January, World Braille Day is observed internationally to commemorate the birth of Louis Braille and to recognize his efforts. Although the event is not considered a public holiday, it has been recognized by the United Nations as an official day of celebration since 2019.

== Braille devices ==
There is a variety of contemporary electronic devices that serve the needs of blind people that operate in Braille, such as refreshable braille displays and Braille e-books that use different technologies for transmitting graphic information of different types (pictures, maps, graphs, texts, etc.).

<doc id="3936" wikidata="Q326724" url="?curid=3936" title="Bastille Day">
<text>Bastille Day is the common name given in English-speaking countries to the national day of France, which is celebrated on 14 July each year. It is referred to, both legally and commonly, as  () in French, though &quot;la fête nationale&quot; is also used in the press.

French National Day is the anniversary of the Storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789, a major event of the French Revolution, as well as the that celebrated the unity of the French people on 14 July 1790. Celebrations are held throughout France. One that has been reported as &quot;the oldest and largest military parade in Europe&quot; is held on 14 July on the Champs-Élysées in Paris in front of the President of France, along with other French officials and foreign guests.

==History==
In 1789, tensions rose in France between reformist and conservative factions as the country struggled to resolve an economic crisis. In May, the Estates General legislative assembly was revived, but members of the Third Estate broke ranks, declaring themselves to be the National Assembly of the country, and on 20 June, vowed to write a constitution for the kingdom. 

On 11 July, Jacques Necker, the finance minister of Louis XVI, who was sympathetic to the Third Estate, was dismissed by the King, provoking an angry reaction among Parisians. Crowds formed, fearful of an attack by the royal army or by foreign regiments of mercenaries in the King&#x27;s service and seeking to arm themselves. Early on 14 July, a crowd besieged the Hôtel des Invalides for firearms, muskets, and cannons stored in its cellars. That same day, another crowd stormed the Bastille, a fortress-prison in Paris that had historically held people jailed on the basis of &quot;lettres de cachet&quot; (literally &quot;signet letters&quot;), arbitrary royal indictments that could not be appealed and did not indicate the reason for the imprisonment, and was believed to hold a cache of ammunition and gunpowder. As it happened, at the time of the attack, the Bastille held only seven inmates, none of great political significance. 

The crowd was eventually reinforced by the mutinous Régiment des Gardes Françaises (&quot;Regiment of French Guards&quot;), whose usual role was to protect public buildings. They proved a fair match for the fort&#x27;s defenders, and Governor de Launay, the commander of the Bastille, capitulated and opened the gates to avoid a mutual massacre. According to the official documents, about 200 attackers and just one defender died before the capitulation. However, possibly because of a misunderstanding, fighting resumed. In this second round of fighting, de Launay and seven other defenders were killed, as was Jacques de Flesselles, the &quot;prévôt des marchands&quot; (&quot;provost of the merchants&quot;), the elected head of the city&#x27;s guilds, who under the French monarchy had the responsibilities of a present-day mayor.

Shortly after the storming of the Bastille, late in the evening of 4 August, after a very stormy session of the &quot;Assemblée constituante&quot;, feudalism was abolished. On 26 August, the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (&quot;Déclaration des Droits de l&#x27;Homme et du Citoyen&quot;) was proclaimed.

===&quot;Fête de la Fédération&quot;===
As early as 1789, the year of the storming of the Bastille, preliminary designs for a national festival were underway. These designs were intended to strengthen the country&#x27;s national identity through the celebration of the events of 14 July 1789. One of the first designs was proposed by Clément Gonchon, a French textile worker, who presented his design for a festival celebrating the anniversary of the storming of the Bastille to the French city administration and the public on 9 December 1789. There were other proposals and unofficial celebrations of 14 July 1789, but the official festival sponsored by the National Assembly was called the Fête de la Fédération.

The &quot;Fête de la Fédération&quot; on 14 July 1790 was a celebration of the unity of the French nation during the French Revolution. The aim of this celebration, one year after the Storming of the Bastille, was to symbolize peace. The event took place on the Champ de Mars, which was located far outside of Paris at the time. The work needed to transform the Champ de Mars into a suitable location for the celebration was not on schedule to be completed in time. On the day recalled as the Journée des brouettes (&quot;The Day of the Wheelbarrow&quot;), thousands of Parisian citizens gathered together to finish the construction needed for the celebration.

The day of the festival, the National Guard assembled and proceeded along the boulevard du Temple in the pouring rain, and were met by an estimated 260,000 Parisian citizens at the Champ de Mars. A mass was celebrated by Talleyrand, bishop of Autun. The popular General Lafayette, as captain of the National Guard of Paris and a confidant of the king, took his oath to the constitution, followed by King Louis XVI. After the end of the official celebration, the day ended in a huge four-day popular feast, and people celebrated with fireworks, as well as fine wine and running nude through the streets in order to display their freedom.

===Origin of the current celebration===

On 30 June 1878, a feast was officially arranged in Paris to honour the French Republic (the event was commemorated in a painting by Claude Monet). On 14 July 1879, there was another feast, with a semi-official aspect. The day&#x27;s events included a reception in the Chamber of Deputies, organised and presided over by Léon Gambetta (a military reviewer at Longchamp), and a Republican Feast in the Pré Catelan. All throughout France, &quot;Le Figaro&quot; wrote, &quot;people feasted much to honour the storming of the Bastille&quot;.

In 1880, the government of the Third Republic wanted to revive the 14 July festival. The campaign for the reinstatement of the festival was sponsored by the notable politician Léon Gambetta and scholar Henri Baudrillant. On 21 May 1880, Benjamin Raspail proposed a law, signed by sixty-four members of government, to have &quot;the Republic adopt 14 July as the day of an annual national festival&quot;. There were many disputes over which date to be remembered as the national holiday, including 4 August (the commemoration of the end of the feudal system), 5 May (when the Estates-General first assembled), 27 July (the fall of Robespierre), and 21 January (the date of Louis XVI&#x27;s execution). The government decided that the date of the holiday would be 14 July, but that was still somewhat problematic. The events of 14 July 1789 were illegal under the previous government, which contradicted the Third Republic&#x27;s need to establish legal legitimacy. French politicians also did not want the sole foundation of their national holiday to be rooted in a day of bloodshed and class-hatred as the day of storming the Bastille was. Instead, they based the establishment of the holiday as both the celebration of the Fête de la Fédération, a festival celebrating the anniversary of the Republic of France on 14 July 1789, and the storming of the Bastille. The Assembly voted in favor of the proposal on 21 May, and 8 June. The law was approved on 27 and 29 June. The celebration was made official on 6 July 1880.

In the debate leading up to the adoption of the holiday, Senator Henri Martin, who wrote the National Day law, addressed the chamber on 29 June 1880:

===Bastille Day military parade===
The Bastille Day military parade is the French military parade that has been held in the morning, every year in Paris, since 1880. While previously held elsewhere within or near the capital city, since 1918 it has been held on the Champs-Élysées, with the participation of the Allies as represented in the Versailles Peace Conference, and with the exception of the period of German occupation from 1940 to 1944 (when the ceremony took place in London under the command of General Charles de Gaulle); and 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic forced its cancellation. The parade passes down the Champs-Élysées from the Arc de Triomphe to the Place de la Concorde, where the President of the French Republic, his government and foreign ambassadors to France stand. This is a popular event in France, broadcast on French TV, and is the oldest and largest regular military parade in Europe.

Smaller military parades are held in French garrison towns, including Toulon and Belfort, with local troops.

==Bastille Day celebrations in other countries==
===Belgium===
Liège celebrates Bastille Day each year since the end of the First World War, as Liège was decorated by the Légion d&#x27;Honneur for its unexpected resistance during the Battle of Liège. The city also hosts a fireworks show outside of Congress Hall. Specifically in Liège, celebrations of Bastille Day have been known to be bigger than the celebrations of the Belgian National holiday. Around 35,000 people gather to celebrate Bastille Day. There is a traditional festival dance of the French consul that draws large crowds, and many unofficial events over the city celebrate the relationship between France and the city of Liège.

===New Zealand===
The Auckland suburb of Remuera hosts an annual French-themed Bastille Day street festival. Visitors enjoy mimes, dancers, music, as well as French foods and drinks. The budding relationship between the two countries, with the establishment of a Maori garden in France and exchange of their analyses of cave art, resulted in the creation of an official reception at the Residence of France. There is also an event in Wellington for the French community held at the Residence of France.

===South Africa===
Franschhoek&#x27;s weekend festival has been celebrated since 1993. (Franschhoek, or &#x27;French Corner,&#x27; is situated in the Western Cape.) As South Africa&#x27;s gourmet capital, French food, wine and other entertainment is provided throughout the festival. The French Consulate in South Africa also celebrates their national holiday with a party for the French community. Activities also include dressing up in different items of French clothing.

=== French Polynesia===
Following colonial rule, France annexed a large portion of what is now French Polynesia. Under French rule, Tahitians were permitted to participate in sport, singing, and dancing competitions one day a year: Bastille Day. The single day of celebration evolved into the major Heiva i Tahiti festival in Papeete Tahiti, where traditional events such as canoe races, tattooing, and fire walks are held. The singing and dancing competitions continue with music composed with traditional instruments such as the nasal flute and ukulele.

===United Kingdom===
Within the UK, London has a large French contingent, and celebrates Bastille Day at various locations across the city including Battersea Park, Camden Town and Kentish Town. Live entertainment is performed at Canary Wharf, with weeklong performances of French theatre at the Lion and Unicorn Theatre in Kentish Town.

It takes place at King Park in Newport at the monument memorializing the accomplishments of the General Comte de Rochambeau whose 6,000 to 7,000 French forces landed in Newport on 11 July 1780. Their assistance in the defeat of the English in the War of Independence is well documented and is proof of the special relationship between France and the United States. In Washington D.C., food, music, and auction events are sponsored by the Embassy of France. There is also a French Festival within the city, where families can meet period entertainment groups set during the time of the French Revolution.

In Dallas, Texas, the Bastille Day celebration, &quot;Bastille On Bishop&quot;, began in 2010 and is held annually in the Bishop Arts District of the North Oak Cliff neighborhood, southwest of downtown just across the Trinity River.

<doc id="3940" wikidata="Q815853" url="?curid=3940" title="Blowfish (cipher)">
<text>Blowfish is a symmetric-key block cipher, designed in 1993 by Bruce Schneier and included in many cipher suites and encryption products. Blowfish provides a good encryption rate in software, and no effective cryptanalysis of it has been found to date for smaller files. It is recommended Blowfish should not be used to encrypt files larger than 4GB in size, Twofish should be used instead. 

Blowfish has a 64-bit block size and therefore it could be vulnerable to Sweet32 birthday attacks.

Schneier designed Blowfish as a general-purpose algorithm, intended as an alternative to the aging DES and free of the problems and constraints associated with other algorithms. At the time Blowfish was released, many other designs were proprietary, encumbered by patents, or were commercial or government secrets. Schneier has stated that &quot;Blowfish is unpatented, and will remain so in all countries. The algorithm is hereby placed in the public domain, and can be freely used by anyone.&quot;

Notable features of the design include key-dependent S-boxes and a highly complex key schedule.

==The algorithm==
Blowfish has a 64-bit block size and a variable key length from 32 bits up to 448 bits. It is a 16-round Feistel cipher and uses large key-dependent S-boxes. In structure it resembles CAST-128, which uses fixed S-boxes.

The adjacent diagram shows Blowfish&#x27;s encryption routine. Each line represents 32 bits. There are five subkey-arrays: one 18-entry P-array (denoted as K in the diagram, to avoid confusion with the Plaintext) and four 256-entry S-boxes (S0, S1, S2 and S3).

Every round &quot;r&quot; consists of 4 actions: 
The F-function splits the 32-bit input into four 8-bit quarters and uses the quarters as input to the S-boxes. The S-boxes accept 8-bit input and produce 32-bit output. The outputs are added modulo 232 and XORed to produce the final 32-bit output (see image in the upper right corner).

After the 16th round, undo the last swap, and XOR L with K18 and R with K17 (output whitening).

Decryption is exactly the same as encryption, except that P1, P2, ..., P18 are used in the reverse order. This is not so obvious because xor is commutative and associative. A common misconception is to use inverse order of encryption as decryption algorithm (i.e. first XORing P17 and P18 to the ciphertext block, then using the P-entries in reverse order).

Blowfish&#x27;s key schedule starts by initializing the P-array and S-boxes with values derived from the hexadecimal digits of pi, which contain no obvious pattern (see nothing up my sleeve number). The secret key is then, byte by byte, cycling the key if necessary, XORed with all the P-entries in order. A 64-bit all-zero block is then encrypted with the algorithm as it stands. The resultant ciphertext replaces P1 and P2. The same ciphertext is then encrypted again with the new subkeys, and the new ciphertext replaces P3 and P4. This continues, replacing the entire P-array and all the S-box entries. In all, the Blowfish encryption algorithm will run 521 times to generate all the subkeys about 4 KB of data is processed.

Because the P-array is 576 bits long, and the key bytes are XORed through all these 576 bits during the initialization, many implementations support key sizes up to 576 bits. The reason for that is a discrepancy between the original Blowfish description, which uses 448-bit keys, and its reference implementation, which uses 576-bit keys. The test vectors for verifying third-party implementations were also produced with 576-bit keys. When asked which Blowfish version is the correct one, Bruce Schneier answered: &quot;The test vectors should be used to determine the one true Blowfish&quot;.

Another opinion is that the 448 bits limit is present to ensure that every bit of every subkey depends on every bit of the key, as the last four values of the P-array don&#x27;t affect every bit of the ciphertext. This point should be taken in consideration for implementations with a different number of rounds, as even though it increases security against an exhaustive attack, it weakens the security guaranteed by the algorithm. And given the slow initialization of the cipher with each change of key, it is granted a natural protection against brute-force attacks, which doesn&#x27;t really justify key sizes longer than 448 bits.

==Blowfish in pseudocode==
 P[18] // &quot;P-array of 18 elements&quot;
 S[4][256] // &quot;S-boxes: 4 arrays of 256 elements&quot;
 function f(x):
 // &quot;Calculates a function f on a 32-bit input x, using S-boxes and bit manipulation&quot;
 high_byte := (x shifted right by 24 bits)
 second_byte := (x shifted right by 16 bits) AND 0xff
 third_byte := (x shifted right by 8 bits) AND 0xff
 low_byte := x AND 0xff
 h := S[0][high_byte] + S[1][second_byte]
 return (h XOR S[2][third_byte]) + S[3][low_byte]
 procedure blowfish_encrypt(L, R):
 // &quot;Encrypts two 32-bit halves L and R using the P-array and function f over 16 rounds&quot;
 for round := 0 to 15:
 L := L XOR P[round]
 R := f(L) XOR R
 swap values of L and R
 swap values of L and R
 R := R XOR P[16]
 L := L XOR P[17]
 procedure blowfish_decrypt(L, R):
 // &quot;Decrypts two 32-bit halves L and R using the P-array and function f over 16 rounds in reverse&quot;
 for round := 17 down to 2:
 L := L XOR P[round]
 R := f(L) XOR R
 swap values of L and R
 swap values of L and R
 R := R XOR P[1]
 L := L XOR P[0]
 // &quot;Initializes the P-array and S-boxes using the provided key, followed by key expansion&quot;
 //&quot; Initialize P-array with the key values&quot;
 key_position := 0
 for i := 0 to 17:
 k := 0
 for j := 0 to 3:
 k := (k shifted left by 8 bits) OR key[key_position]
 key_position := (key_position + 1) mod key_length
 P[i] := P[i] XOR k
 //&quot; Blowfish key expansion (521 iterations)&quot;
 L := 0, R := 0
 for i := 0 to 17 by 2:
 blowfish_encrypt(L, R)
 P[i] := L
 P[i + 1] := R
 //&quot; Fill S-boxes by encrypting L and R&quot;
 for i := 0 to 3:
 for j := 0 to 255 by 2:
 blowfish_encrypt(L, R)
 S[i][j] := L
 S[i][j + 1] := R

== Blowfish in practice ==
Blowfish is a fast block cipher, except when changing keys. Each new key requires the pre-processing equivalent of encrypting about 4 kilobytes of text, which is very slow compared to other block ciphers. This prevents its use in certain applications, but is not a problem in others.

Blowfish must be initialized with a key. It is good practice to have this key hashed with a hash function before use.

In one application Blowfish&#x27;s slow key changing is actually a benefit: the password-hashing method (crypt $2, i.e. bcrypt) used in OpenBSD uses an algorithm derived from Blowfish that makes use of the slow key schedule; the idea is that the extra computational effort required gives protection against dictionary attacks. &quot;See&quot; key stretching.

Blowfish has a memory footprint of just over 4 kilobytes of RAM. This constraint is not a problem even for older desktop and laptop computers, though it does prevent use in the smallest embedded systems such as early smartcards.

Blowfish was one of the first secure block ciphers not subject to any patents and therefore freely available for anyone to use. This benefit has contributed to its popularity in cryptographic software.

bcrypt is a password hashing function which, combined with a variable number of iterations (work &quot;cost&quot;), exploits the expensive key setup phase of Blowfish to increase the workload and duration of hash calculations, further reducing threats from brute force attacks.

bcrypt is also the name of a cross-platform file encryption utility developed in 2002 that implements Blowfish.

==Weakness and successors==
Blowfish&#x27;s use of a 64-bit block size (as opposed to e.g. AES&#x27;s 128-bit block size) makes it vulnerable to birthday attacks, particularly in contexts like HTTPS. In 2016, the SWEET32 attack demonstrated how to leverage birthday attacks to perform plaintext recovery (i.e. decrypting ciphertext) against ciphers with a 64-bit block size. The GnuPG project recommends that Blowfish not be used to encrypt files larger than 4 GB due to its small block size.

A reduced-round variant of Blowfish is known to be susceptible to known-plaintext attacks on reflectively weak keys. Blowfish implementations use 16 rounds of encryption, and are not susceptible to this attack.

Bruce Schneier has recommended migrating to his Blowfish successor, Twofish.

Blowfish2 was released in 2005, developed by Alexander Pukall. It has exactly the same design but has twice as many S tables and uses 64-bit integers instead of 32-bit integers. It no longer works on 64-bit blocks but on 128-bit blocks like AES. Blowfish2 is used for example, in FreePascal.

<text>A bijection, bijective function, or one-to-one correspondence between two mathematical sets is a function such that each element of the second set (the codomain) is the image of exactly one element of the first set (the domain). Equivalently, a bijection is a relation between two sets such that each element of either set is paired with exactly one element of the other set.

A function is bijective if and only if it is invertible; that is, a function formula_1 is bijective if and only if there is a function formula_2 the &quot;inverse&quot; of , such that each of the two ways for composing the two functions produces an identity function: formula_3 for each formula_4 in formula_5 and formula_6 for each formula_7 in formula_8

For example, the &quot;multiplication by two&quot; defines a bijection from the integers to the even numbers, which has the &quot;division by two&quot; as its inverse function.

A function is bijective if and only if it is both injective (or &quot;one-to-one&quot;)—meaning that each element in the codomain is mapped from at most one element of the domain—and surjective (or &quot;onto&quot;)—meaning that each element of the codomain is mapped from at least one element of the domain. The term &quot;one-to-one correspondence&quot; must not be confused with &quot;one-to-one function&quot;, which means injective but not necessarily surjective.

The elementary operation of counting establishes a bijection from some finite set to the first natural numbers , up to the number of elements in the counted set. It results that two finite sets have the same number of elements if and only if there exists a bijection between them. More generally, two sets are said to have the same cardinal number if there exists a bijection between them.

A bijective function from a set to itself is also called a permutation, and the set of all permutations of a set forms its symmetric group.

Some bijections with further properties have received specific names, which include automorphisms, isomorphisms, homeomorphisms, diffeomorphisms, permutation groups, and most geometric transformations. Galois correspondences are bijections between sets of mathematical objects of apparently very different nature.

==Definition==
For a binary relation pairing elements of set &quot;X&quot; with elements of set &quot;Y&quot; to be a bijection, four properties must hold:
# each element of &quot;X&quot; must be paired with at least one element of &quot;Y&quot;,
# no element of &quot;X&quot; may be paired with more than one element of &quot;Y&quot;,
# each element of &quot;Y&quot; must be paired with at least one element of &quot;X&quot;, and
# no element of &quot;Y&quot; may be paired with more than one element of &quot;X&quot;.

Satisfying properties (1) and (2) means that a pairing is a function with domain &quot;X&quot;. It is more common to see properties (1) and (2) written as a single statement: Every element of &quot;X&quot; is paired with exactly one element of &quot;Y&quot;. Functions which satisfy property (3) are said to be &quot;onto &quot;Y&quot; &quot; and are called surjections (or &quot;surjective functions&quot;). Functions which satisfy property (4) are said to be &quot;one-to-one functions&quot; and are called injections (or &quot;injective functions&quot;). With this terminology, a bijection is a function which is both a surjection and an injection, or using other words, a bijection is a function which is both &quot;one-to-one&quot; and &quot;onto&quot;.

==Examples==

=== Batting line-up of a baseball or cricket team===
Consider the batting line-up of a baseball or cricket team (or any list of all the players of any sports team where every player holds a specific spot in a line-up). The set &quot;X&quot; will be the players on the team (of size nine in the case of baseball) and the set &quot;Y&quot; will be the positions in the batting order (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) The &quot;pairing&quot; is given by which player is in what position in this order. Property (1) is satisfied since each player is somewhere in the list. Property (2) is satisfied since no player bats in two (or more) positions in the order. Property (3) says that for each position in the order, there is some player batting in that position and property (4) states that two or more players are never batting in the same position in the list.

=== Seats and students of a classroom===
In a classroom there are a certain number of seats. A group of students enter the room and the instructor asks them to be seated. After a quick look around the room, the instructor declares that there is a bijection between the set of students and the set of seats, where each student is paired with the seat they are sitting in. What the instructor observed in order to reach this conclusion was that:
# Every student was in a seat (there was no one standing),
# No student was in more than one seat,
# Every seat had someone sitting there (there were no empty seats), and
# No seat had more than one student in it. 
The instructor was able to conclude that there were just as many seats as there were students, without having to count either set.

==More mathematical examples==

* For any set &quot;X&quot;, the identity function 1&quot;X&quot;: &quot;X&quot; → &quot;X&quot;, 1&quot;X&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot; is bijective.
* The function &quot;f&quot;: R → R, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = 2&quot;x&quot; + 1 is bijective, since for each &quot;y&quot; there is a unique &quot;x&quot; = (&quot;y&quot; − 1)/2 such that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;y&quot;. More generally, any linear function over the reals, &quot;f&quot;: R → R, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;ax&quot; + &quot;b&quot; (where &quot;a&quot; is non-zero) is a bijection. Each real number &quot;y&quot; is obtained from (or paired with) the real number &quot;x&quot; = (&quot;y&quot; − &quot;b&quot;)/&quot;a&quot;.
* The function &quot;f&quot;: R → (−π/2, π/2), given by &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = arctan(&quot;x&quot;) is bijective, since each real number &quot;x&quot; is paired with exactly one angle &quot;y&quot; in the interval (−π/2, π/2) so that tan(&quot;y&quot;) = &quot;x&quot; (that is, &quot;y&quot; = arctan(&quot;x&quot;)). If the codomain (−π/2, π/2) was made larger to include an integer multiple of π/2, then this function would no longer be onto (surjective), since there is no real number which could be paired with the multiple of π/2 by this arctan function.
* The exponential function, &quot;g&quot;: R → R, &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = e&quot;x&quot;, is not bijective: for instance, there is no &quot;x&quot; in R such that &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = −1, showing that &quot;g&quot; is not onto (surjective). However, if the codomain is restricted to the positive real numbers formula_9, then &quot;g&quot; would be bijective; its inverse (see below) is the natural logarithm function ln.
* The function &quot;h&quot;: R → R+, &quot;h&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot;2 is not bijective: for instance, &quot;h&quot;(−1) = &quot;h&quot;(1) = 1, showing that &quot;h&quot; is not one-to-one (injective). However, if the domain is restricted to formula_10, then &quot;h&quot; would be bijective; its inverse is the positive square root function.
*By Schröder–Bernstein theorem, given any two sets &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, and two injective functions &quot;f&quot;: &quot;X → Y&quot; and &quot;g&quot;: &quot;Y → X&quot;, there exists a bijective function &quot;h&quot;: &quot;X → Y&quot;.

==Inverses==
A bijection &quot;f&quot; with domain &quot;X&quot; (indicated by &quot;f&quot;: &quot;X → Y&quot; in functional notation) also defines a converse relation starting in &quot;Y&quot; and going to &quot;X&quot; (by turning the arrows around). The process of &quot;turning the arrows around&quot; for an arbitrary function does not, &quot;in general&quot;, yield a function, but properties (3) and (4) of a bijection say that this inverse relation is a function with domain &quot;Y&quot;. Moreover, properties (1) and (2) then say that this inverse &quot;function&quot; is a surjection and an injection, that is, the inverse function exists and is also a bijection. Functions that have inverse functions are said to be invertible. A function is invertible if and only if it is a bijection.

Stated in concise mathematical notation, a function &quot;f&quot;: &quot;X → Y&quot; is bijective if and only if it satisfies the condition
:for every &quot;y&quot; in &quot;Y&quot; there is a unique &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot; with &quot;y&quot; = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;).

Continuing with the baseball batting line-up example, the function that is being defined takes as input the name of one of the players and outputs the position of that player in the batting order. Since this function is a bijection, it has an inverse function which takes as input a position in the batting order and outputs the player who will be batting in that position.

==Composition==
The composition formula_11 of two bijections &quot;f&quot;: &quot;X → Y&quot; and &quot;g&quot;: &quot;Y → Z&quot; is a bijection, whose inverse is given by formula_11 is formula_13.

Conversely, if the composition formula_14 of two functions is bijective, it only follows that &quot;f&quot; is injective and &quot;g&quot; is surjective.

==Cardinality==
If &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are finite sets, then there exists a bijection between the two sets &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; if and only if &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; have the same number of elements. Indeed, in axiomatic set theory, this is taken as the definition of &quot;same number of elements&quot; (equinumerosity), and generalising this definition to infinite sets leads to the concept of cardinal number, a way to distinguish the various sizes of infinite sets.

== Properties ==
* A function &quot;f&quot;: R → R is bijective if and only if its graph meets every horizontal and vertical line exactly once.
* If &quot;X&quot; is a set, then the bijective functions from &quot;X&quot; to itself, together with the operation of functional composition (∘), form a group, the symmetric group of &quot;X&quot;, which is denoted variously by S(&quot;X&quot;), &quot;SX&quot;, or &quot;X&quot;! (&quot;X&quot; factorial).
* Bijections preserve cardinalities of sets: for a subset &quot;A&quot; of the domain with cardinality |&quot;A&quot;| and subset &quot;B&quot; of the codomain with cardinality |&quot;B&quot;|, one has the following equalities:
*:|&quot;f&quot;(&quot;A&quot;)| = |&quot;A&quot;| and |&quot;f&quot;−1(&quot;B&quot;)| = |&quot;B&quot;|.
*If &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are finite sets with the same cardinality, and &quot;f&quot;: &quot;X → Y&quot;, then the following are equivalent:
*# &quot;f&quot; is a bijection.
*# &quot;f&quot; is a surjection.
*# &quot;f&quot; is an injection.
*For a finite set &quot;S&quot;, there is a bijection between the set of possible total orderings of the elements and the set of bijections from &quot;S&quot; to &quot;S&quot;. That is to say, the number of permutations of elements of &quot;S&quot; is the same as the number of total orderings of that set—namely, &quot;n&quot;!.

==Category theory==
Bijections are precisely the isomorphisms in the category &quot;Set&quot; of sets and set functions. However, the bijections are not always the isomorphisms for more complex categories. For example, in the category &quot;Grp&quot; of groups, the morphisms must be homomorphisms since they must preserve the group structure, so the isomorphisms are &quot;group isomorphisms&quot; which are bijective homomorphisms.

==Generalization to partial functions==
The notion of one-to-one correspondence generalizes to partial functions, where they are called &quot;partial bijections&quot;, although partial bijections are only required to be injective. The reason for this relaxation is that a (proper) partial function is already undefined for a portion of its domain; thus there is no compelling reason to constrain its inverse to be a total function, i.e. defined everywhere on its domain. The set of all partial bijections on a given base set is called the symmetric inverse semigroup.

Another way of defining the same notion is to say that a partial bijection from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot; is any relation 
&quot;R&quot; (which turns out to be a partial function) with the property that &quot;R&quot; is the graph of a bijection &quot;f&quot;:&quot;A′&quot;→&quot;B′&quot;, where &quot;A′&quot; is a subset of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B′&quot; is a subset of &quot;B&quot;.

When the partial bijection is on the same set, it is sometimes called a &quot;one-to-one partial transformation&quot;. An example is the Möbius transformation simply defined on the complex plane, rather than its completion to the extended complex plane.

<text>In mathematics, a binary function (also called bivariate function, or function of two variables) is a function that takes two inputs.

Precisely stated, a function formula_1 is binary if there exists sets formula_2 such that
:formula_3
where formula_4 is the Cartesian product of formula_5 and formula_6

==Alternative definitions==
Set-theoretically, a binary function can be represented as a subset of the Cartesian product formula_7, where formula_8 belongs to the subset if and only if formula_9.
Conversely, a subset formula_10 defines a binary function if and only if for any formula_11 and formula_12, there exists a unique formula_13 such that formula_8 belongs to formula_10.
formula_16 is then defined to be this formula_17.

Alternatively, a binary function may be interpreted as simply a function from formula_4 to formula_19.
Even when thought of this way, however, one generally writes formula_16 instead of formula_21.
(That is, the same pair of parentheses is used to indicate both function application and the formation of an ordered pair.)

==Examples==
Division of whole numbers can be thought of as a function. If formula_22 is the set of integers, formula_23 is the set of natural numbers (except for zero), and formula_24 is the set of rational numbers, then division is a binary function formula_25.

In a vector space &quot;V&quot; over a field &quot;F&quot;, scalar multiplication is a binary function. A scalar &quot;a&quot; ∈ &quot;F&quot; is combined with a vector &quot;v&quot; ∈ &quot;V&quot; to produce a new vector &quot;av&quot; ∈ &quot;V&quot;.

Another example is that of inner products, or more generally functions of the form formula_26, where , are real-valued vectors of appropriate size and is a matrix. If is a positive definite matrix, this yields an inner product.

==Functions of two real variables==
Functions whose domain is a subset of formula_27 are often also called functions of two variables even if their domain does not form a rectangle and thus the cartesian product of two sets.

==Restrictions to ordinary functions==
In turn, one can also derive ordinary functions of one variable from a binary function.
Given any element formula_11, there is a function formula_29, or formula_30, from formula_31 to formula_19, given by formula_33.
Similarly, given any element formula_12, there is a function formula_35, or formula_36, from formula_5 to formula_19, given by formula_39. In computer science, this identification between a function from formula_4 to formula_19 and a function from formula_5 to formula_43, where formula_43 is the set of all functions from formula_31 to formula_19, is called &quot;currying&quot;.

==Generalisations==
The various concepts relating to functions can also be generalised to binary functions.
For example, the division example above is &quot;surjective&quot; (or &quot;onto&quot;) because every rational number may be expressed as a quotient of an integer and a natural number.
This example is &quot;injective&quot; in each input separately, because the functions &quot;f&quot; &quot;x&quot; and &quot;f&quot; &quot;y&quot; are always injective.
However, it&#x27;s not injective in both variables simultaneously, because (for example) &quot;f&quot; (2,4) = &quot;f&quot; (1,2).

One can also consider &quot;partial&quot; binary functions, which may be defined only for certain values of the inputs.
For example, the division example above may also be interpreted as a partial binary function from Z and N to Q, where N is the set of all natural numbers, including zero.
But this function is undefined when the second input is zero.

A binary operation is a binary function where the sets &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, and &quot;Z&quot; are all equal; binary operations are often used to define algebraic structures.

In linear algebra, a bilinear transformation is a binary function where the sets &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, and &quot;Z&quot; are all vector spaces and the derived functions &quot;f&quot; &quot;x&quot; and &quot;f&quot;&quot;y&quot; are all linear transformations.
A bilinear transformation, like any binary function, can be interpreted as a function from &quot;X&quot; × &quot;Y&quot; to &quot;Z&quot;, but this function in general won&#x27;t be linear.
However, the bilinear transformation can also be interpreted as a single linear transformation from the tensor product formula_47 to &quot;Z&quot;.

==Generalisations to ternary and other functions==

The concept of binary function generalises to &quot;ternary&quot; (or &quot;3-ary&quot;) &quot;function&quot;, &quot;quaternary&quot; (or &quot;4-ary&quot;) &quot;function&quot;, or more generally to &quot;n-ary function&quot; for any natural number &quot;n&quot;.
A &quot;0-ary function&quot; to &quot;Z&quot; is simply given by an element of &quot;Z&quot;.
One can also define an &quot;A-ary function&quot; where &quot;A&quot; is any set; there is one input for each element of &quot;A&quot;.

==Category theory==
In category theory, &quot;n&quot;-ary functions generalise to &quot;n&quot;-ary morphisms in a multicategory.
The interpretation of an &quot;n&quot;-ary morphism as an ordinary morphisms whose domain is some sort of product of the domains of the original &quot;n&quot;-ary morphism will work in a monoidal category.
The construction of the derived morphisms of one variable will work in a closed monoidal category.
The category of sets is closed monoidal, but so is the category of vector spaces, giving the notion of bilinear transformation above.

<doc id="3947" wikidata="Q660950" url="?curid=3947" title="Blue Velvet (film)">
<text>Blue Velvet is a 1986 American neo-noir mystery thriller film written and directed by David Lynch. Blending psychological horror with film noir, the film stars Kyle MacLachlan, Isabella Rossellini, Dennis Hopper, and Laura Dern, and is named after the 1951 song of the same name. The film follows a college student who returns to his suburban hometown and discovers a severed human ear in a field, which leads him to uncover a criminal conspiracy involving a troubled lounge singer.

The screenplay of &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; had been passed around multiple times in the late 1970s and early 1980s, with several major studios declining it due to its strong sexual and violent content. After the failure of his 1984 film &quot;Dune&quot;, Lynch made attempts at developing a more &quot;personal story&quot;, somewhat characteristic of the surrealist style displayed in his first film &quot;Eraserhead&quot; (1977). The independent studio De Laurentiis Entertainment Group, owned at the time by Italian film producer Dino De Laurentiis, agreed to finance and produce the film.

&quot;Blue Velvet&quot; initially received a divided critical response, with many stating that its explicit content served little artistic purpose. Nevertheless, the film earned Lynch his second nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director, and received the year&#x27;s Best Film and Best Director prizes from the National Society of Film Critics. It came to achieve cult status. As an example of a director casting against the norm, it was credited for revitalizing Hopper&#x27;s career and for providing Rossellini with a dramatic outlet beyond her previous work as a fashion model and a cosmetics spokeswoman. In the years since, the film has been re-evaluated, and it is now widely regarded as one of Lynch&#x27;s major works and one of the greatest films of the 1980s. Publications including &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; and &quot;BBC Magazine&quot; have ranked it among the greatest American films of all time. In 2008, it was chosen by the American Film Institute as one of the ten greatest American mystery films.

==Plot==

College student Jeffrey Beaumont returns to his suburban hometown of Lumberton, North Carolina, after his father, Tom, has a near-fatal attack from a medical condition. Walking home from the hospital, Jeffrey cuts through a vacant lot and discovers a severed human ear, which he takes to police detective John Williams. Williams&#x27;s daughter Sandy tells Jeffrey that the ear somehow relates to a lounge singer named Dorothy Vallens. Intrigued, Jeffrey enters her apartment by posing as an exterminator. While there, he steals a spare key while she is distracted by a man in a distinctive yellow sport coat, whom Jeffrey nicknames the &quot;Yellow Man&quot;.

Jeffrey and Sandy attend Dorothy&#x27;s nightclub act, in which she sings &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;, and leave early so Jeffrey can break into her apartment. Dorothy returns home and undresses; she finds Jeffrey hiding in a closet and forces him to strip at knifepoint, but he retreats to the closet when Frank Booth, a psychopathic gangster and drug lord, arrives and interrupts their encounter. Frank beats and rapes Dorothy while inhaling gas from a canister, alternating between fits of sobbing and violent rage. After Frank leaves, Jeffrey sneaks away and seeks comfort from Sandy.

Surmising that Frank has abducted Dorothy&#x27;s husband Don, and son Donnie, to force her into sexual slavery, Jeffrey suspects that Frank cut off Don&#x27;s ear to intimidate her into submission. While continuing to see Sandy, Jeffrey enters into a sadomasochistic relationship with Dorothy, in which she encourages him to hit her. Jeffrey sees Frank attending Dorothy&#x27;s show and later observes him selling drugs and meeting with the Yellow Man. Jeffrey then sees the Yellow Man meeting with a &quot;well-dressed man&quot;.

When Frank catches Jeffrey leaving Dorothy&#x27;s apartment, he abducts them and takes them to the lair of Ben, a criminal associate holding Don and Donnie hostage. Frank permits Dorothy to see her family and forces Jeffrey to watch Ben perform an impromptu lip-sync of Roy Orbison&#x27;s &quot;In Dreams&quot;, which moves Frank to tears. Afterwards, he and his gang take Jeffrey and Dorothy on a high-speed joyride to a sawmill yard, where he again attempts to sexually abuse Dorothy. When Jeffrey intervenes and punches him in the face, an enraged Frank and his gang pull him out of the car. Replaying the tape of &quot;In Dreams&quot;, Frank smears lipstick on his face and violently kisses Jeffrey. Frank then has Jeffrey restrained and beats him unconscious, while Dorothy pleads for Frank to stop. Jeffrey awakens the next morning, bruised and bloodied.

While visiting the police station, Jeffrey discovers that the Yellow Man is Detective Williams&#x27;s partner Tom Gordon, who has been murdering Frank&#x27;s rival drug dealers and stealing confiscated narcotics from the evidence room for Frank to sell. After Jeffrey and Sandy declare their love for each other at a party, they are pursued by a car which they assume belongs to Frank; as they arrive at Jeffrey&#x27;s home, Sandy realizes the driver is her ex-boyfriend, Mike. After Mike threatens to beat Jeffrey for stealing his girlfriend, Dorothy appears on Jeffrey&#x27;s porch naked, beaten, and confused. Mike backs down as Jeffrey and Sandy whisk Dorothy to Sandy&#x27;s house to summon medical attention.

When Dorothy calls Jeffrey &quot;my secret lover&quot;, a distraught Sandy slaps him for cheating on her. Jeffrey asks Sandy to tell her father everything, and Detective Williams then leads a police raid on Frank&#x27;s headquarters, killing Frank&#x27;s men. Jeffrey returns alone to Dorothy&#x27;s apartment, where he discovers Don dead and Gordon mortally wounded. As Jeffrey leaves the apartment, the &quot;Well-Dressed Man&quot; arrives, sees Jeffrey in the stairs, and chases him back inside. Jeffrey uses Gordon&#x27;s walkie-talkie to say he is in the bedroom before hiding in the closet. The &quot;Well-Dressed Man&quot; arrives at the apartment and Jeffrey observes he is actually Frank in disguise. Jeffrey kills Frank with Gordon&#x27;s gun when Frank opens the closet door. Moments later, Sandy and Detective Williams arrive.

Some time later, Jeffrey and Sandy have continued their relationship, Tom Beaumont has recovered, and Dorothy has been reunited with her son.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Origin===
The film&#x27;s story originated from three ideas that crystallized in the filmmaker&#x27;s mind over a period of time starting as early as 1973.

The first idea was only &quot;a feeling&quot; and the title, as Lynch told &quot;Cineaste&quot; in 1987.

The second idea was an image of a severed, human ear lying in a field. &quot;I don&#x27;t know why it had to be an ear. Except it needed to be an opening of a part of the body, a hole into something else ... The ear sits on the head and goes right into the mind so it felt perfect,&quot; Lynch remarked in a 1986 interview to &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

The third idea was Bobby Vinton&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; and &quot;the mood that came with that song a mood, a time, and things that were of that time.&quot;

The scene in which Dorothy appears naked outside was inspired by a real-life experience Lynch had during childhood when he and his brother saw a naked woman walking down a neighborhood street at night. The experience was so traumatic to the young Lynch that it made him cry, and he had never forgotten it.

After completing &quot;The Elephant Man&quot; (1980), Lynch met producer Richard Roth over coffee. Roth had read and enjoyed Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Ronnie Rocket&quot; script, but did not think it was something he wanted to produce. He asked Lynch if the filmmaker had any other scripts, but the director only had ideas. &quot;I told him I had always wanted to sneak into a girl&#x27;s room to watch her into the night and that, maybe, at one point or another, I would see something that would be the clue to a murder mystery. Roth loved the idea and asked me to write a treatment. I went home and thought of the ear in the field.&quot; Production was announced in August 1984. Lynch wrote two more drafts before he was satisfied with the script of the film. The problem with them, Lynch has said, was that &quot;there was maybe all the unpleasantness in the film but nothing else. A lot was not there. And so it went away for a while.&quot; Conditions at this point were ideal for Lynch&#x27;s film: he had made a deal with Dino De Laurentiis that gave him complete artistic freedom and final cut privileges, with the stipulation that the filmmaker take a cut in his salary and work with a budget of only $6 million. This deal meant that &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; was the smallest film on De Laurentiis&#x27;s slate. Consequently, Lynch would be left mostly unsupervised during production. &quot;After &quot;Dune&quot; I was down so far that anything was up! So it was just a euphoria. And when you work with that kind of feeling, you can take chances. You can experiment.&quot;

===Casting===
The cast of &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; included several then-relatively unknown actors.

Lynch met Isabella Rossellini at a restaurant, and offered her the role of Dorothy Vallens. Helen Mirren had been Lynch&#x27;s first choice for the role. Rossellini had gained some exposure before the film for her Lancôme ads in the early 1980s and for being the daughter of actress Ingrid Bergman and director Roberto Rossellini. After completion of the film, during test screenings, ICM Partners—the agency representing Rossellini—immediately dropped her as a client. Furthermore, the nuns at the school in Rome that Rossellini attended in her youth called to say they were praying for her.

Kyle MacLachlan had played the central role in Lynch&#x27;s critical and commercial failure &quot;Dune&quot; (1984), a science fiction epic based on the novel of the same name. MacLachlan later became a recurring collaborator with Lynch, who remarked: &quot;Kyle plays innocents who are interested in the mysteries of life. He&#x27;s the person you trust enough to go into a strange world with.&quot; Val Kilmer was offered a role in the film, but he turned it down as felt it was too &quot;graphic&quot; for him, a decision he later regretted. Dourif and Stockwell also rejoined Lynch from &quot;Dune&quot;.

Dennis Hopper was the best-known actor in the film, having directed and starred in &quot;Easy Rider&quot; (1969). Hopper—said to be Lynch&#x27;s third choice (Michael Ironside has stated that Frank was written with him in mind)—accepted the role, reportedly having exclaimed, &quot;I&#x27;ve got to play Frank! I am Frank!&quot; Harry Dean Stanton and Steven Berkoff both turned down the role of Frank because of the violent content in the film.

Laura Dern, then 18 years old, was cast as Sandy after several already-successful actresses turned the role down, one among those being Molly Ringwald.

===Shooting===
Principal photography of &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; began in August 1985 and completed in November. The film was shot at EUE/Screen Gems studio in Wilmington, North Carolina, which also provided the exterior scenes of Lumberton. The scene with a raped and battered Dorothy proved to be particularly challenging. Several townspeople arrived to watch the filming with picnic baskets and rugs, against the wishes of Rossellini and Lynch. However, they continued filming as normal, and when Lynch yelled cut, the townspeople left. As a result, police told Lynch they were no longer permitted to shoot in any public areas of Wilmington.

The Carolina Apartments in downtown Wilmington served as Dorothy&#x27;s apartment building, with the adjacent Kenan fountain featured prominently in many shots. The building is also the birth place and death place of noted artist Claude Howell. The apartment building stands today, and the Kenan fountain was refurbished in 2020 after sustaining heavy damage during Hurricane Florence.

===Editing===
Lynch&#x27;s original rough cut ran for approximately four hours. He was contractually obligated to deliver a two-hour movie by De Laurentiis and cut many small subplots and character scenes. He also made cuts at the request of the MPAA. For example, when Frank slaps Dorothy after the first rape scene, the audience was supposed to see Frank actually hitting her. Instead, the film cuts away to Jeffrey in the closet, wincing at what he has just seen. This cut was made to satisfy the MPAA&#x27;s concerns about violence, though Lynch thought that the change made the scene more disturbing.

In 2011, Lynch announced that footage from the deleted scenes, long thought lost, had been discovered. The material was subsequently included on the Blu-ray Disc release of the film. Among the deleted footage was Megan Mullally as Jeffrey&#x27;s college sweetheart Louise Wertham, whose entire role was cut from the theatrical release. The final cut of the film runs at just over two hours.

===Distribution===
Because the material was completely different from anything that would be considered mainstream at the time, De Laurentiis Entertainment Group&#x27;s marketing employees were unsure of how to promote the film, or even if it would be promoted at all; it wasn&#x27;t until the positive reception the film received at various film festivals that they began to promote it.

==Interpretations==

Despite &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;″s initial appearance as a mystery, the film operates on a number of thematic levels. The film owes a large debt to 1950s film noir, containing and exploring such conventions as the femme fatale (Dorothy Vallens), a seemingly unstoppable villain (Frank Booth) and the questionable moral outlook of the hero (Jeffrey Beaumont), as well as its unusual use of shadowy, sometimes dark cinematography. &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; establishes Lynch&#x27;s famous &quot;askew vision&quot; and introduces several common elements of his work, some of which would later become his trademarks, including distorted characters, a polarized world and debilitating damage to the skull or brain. Perhaps the most significant Lynchian trademark in the film is the unearthing of a dark underbelly in a seemingly idealized small town; Jeffrey even proclaims in the film that he is &quot;seeing something that was always hidden&quot;. Lynch&#x27;s characterization of films, symbols and motifs have become well known and his particular style, characterised largely in &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; for the first time, has been written about extensively using descriptions like &quot;dreamlike&quot;, &quot;ultraweird&quot;, &quot;dark&quot;, and &quot;oddball&quot;. Red curtains also appear in key scenes, specifically in Dorothy&#x27;s apartment and at the night club where she sings, which have since become a Lynch trademark. The film has been compared to Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960) because of its stark treatment of evil and mental illness. The premise of both films is curiosity, leading to an investigation that draws the lead characters into a hidden, voyeuristic underworld of crime.

The film&#x27;s thematic framework harks back to Edgar Allan Poe, Henry James and early gothic fiction, as well as films such as &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot; (1943) and &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot; (1955) and the entire notion of film noir. Lynch has called it a &quot;film about things that are hidden - within a small city and within people.&quot;

Feminist psychoanalytic film theorist Laura Mulvey argues that &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; establishes a metaphorical Oedipal family—&quot;the child&quot;, Jeffrey Beaumont and his &quot;parents&quot;, Frank Booth and Dorothy Vallens - both through deliberate references to film noir. Michael Atkinson claims that the resulting violence in the film can be read as symbolic of domestic violence within real families. He reads Jeffrey as an innocent youth who is both horrified by the violence inflicted by Frank and tempted by it as the means of possessing Dorothy for himself. Atkinson takes a Freudian approach to the film, considering it to be an expression of the traumatised innocence which characterises Lynch&#x27;s work. He states, &quot;Dorothy represents the sexual force of the mother [figure] because she is forbidden and because she becomes the object of the unhealthy, infantile impulses at work in Jeffrey&#x27;s subconscious.&quot;

===Symbolism===
Symbolism is used heavily in &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;. The most consistent symbolism in the film is an insect motif introduced at the end of the first scene, when the camera zooms in on a well-kept suburban lawn until it unearths a swarming underground nest of bugs. This is generally recognized as a metaphor for the seedy underworld that Jeffrey will soon discover under the surface of his own suburban paradise. The severed ear he finds is being overrun by black ants. The bug motif is recurrent throughout the film, most notably in the bug-like gas mask that Frank wears and Jeffrey&#x27;s exterminator disguise. One of Frank&#x27;s accomplices is also consistently identified through the yellow jacket he wears, possibly referencing the name of a type of wasp. Finally, a robin eating a bug on a fence becomes a topic of discussion in the last scene of the film.

The severed ear that Jeffrey discovers is also a key symbolic element, leading Jeffrey into danger. Indeed, just as Jeffrey&#x27;s troubles begin, the audience is treated to a nightmarish sequence in which the camera zooms into the canal of the severed, decomposing ear. After the danger has subsided at the end the ear canal closeup is repeated, zooming out on a healthy and clean ear. 

==Soundtrack==

The &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; soundtrack was supervised by Angelo Badalamenti (who makes a brief cameo appearance as the pianist at the Slow Club where Dorothy performs). The soundtrack makes heavy usage of vintage pop songs, such as Bobby Vinton&#x27;s &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; and Roy Orbison&#x27;s &quot;In Dreams&quot;, juxtaposed with an orchestral score. During filming, Lynch placed speakers on set and in streets and played Shostakovich to set the mood he wanted to convey. The score alludes to Shostakovich&#x27;s 15th Symphony, which Lynch had been listening to regularly while writing the screenplay. Lynch had originally opted to use &quot;Song to the Siren&quot; by This Mortal Coil during the scene in which Sandy and Jeffrey share a dance; however, he could not obtain the rights for the song at the time. He would go on to use this song in &quot;Lost Highway&quot; eleven years later.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; soundtrack on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Film Soundtracks&quot;, at the 100th position. Critic John Alexander wrote, &quot;the haunting soundtrack accompanies the title credits, then weaves through the narrative, accentuating the noir mood of the film.&quot; Lynch worked with music composer Angelo Badalamenti for the first time in this film and asked him to write a score that had to be &quot;like Shostakovich, be very Russian, but make it the most beautiful thing but make it dark and a little bit scary.&quot; Badalamenti&#x27;s success with &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; would lead him to contribute to all of Lynch&#x27;s future full-length films until &quot;Inland Empire&quot; as well as the cult television program &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;. Also included in the sound team was long-time Lynch collaborator Alan Splet, a sound editor and designer who had won an Academy Award for his work on &quot;The Black Stallion&quot; (1979) and been nominated for &quot;Never Cry Wolf&quot; (1983).

==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;Blue Velvet&quot; premiered in competition at the Montreal World Film Festival in August 1986, and at the Toronto Festival of Festivals on September 12, 1986, and a few days later in the United States. It debuted commercially in both countries on September 19, 1986, in 98 theatres across the United States. In its opening weekend, the film grossed a total of $789,409. It eventually expanded to another 15 theatres, and in the US and Canada grossed a total of $8,551,228. &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; was met with uproar during its audience reception, with lines formed around city blocks in New York City and Los Angeles. There were reports of mass walkouts and refund demands during its opening week. At a Chicago screening, a man fainted and had to have his pacemaker checked. Upon completion, he returned to the cinema to see the ending. At a Los Angeles cinema, two strangers became engaged in a heated disagreement, but decided to resolve the disagreement to return to the theatre.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Blue Velvet&quot; was released to a very polarized reception in the United States. The critics who did praise the film were often vociferous. &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Janet Maslin directed much praise toward the performances of Hopper and Rossellini: &quot;Mr. Hopper and Miss Rossellini are so far outside the bounds of ordinary acting here that their performances are best understood in terms of sheer lack of inhibition; both give themselves entirely over to the material, which seems to be exactly what&#x27;s called for.&quot; She called it &quot;an instant cult classic&quot;, concluding that &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; &quot;is as fascinating as it is freakish&quot; and &quot;confirms Mr. Lynch&#x27;s stature as an innovator, a superb technician, and someone best not encountered in a dark alley.&quot;

Sheila Benson of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the film &quot;the most brilliantly disturbing film ever to have its roots in small-town American life,&quot; describing it as &quot;shocking, visionary, rapturously controlled&quot;. Film critic Gene Siskel included &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; on his list of the best films of 1986, at the fifth spot. Peter Travers, film critic for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, named it the best film of the 1980s and referred to it as an &quot;American masterpiece&quot;. Upon its initial release, Woody Allen and Martin Scorsese called &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; the best film of the year.

On the other hand, Paul Attanasio of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said &quot;the film showcases a visual stylist utterly in command of his talents&quot; and that Angelo Badalamenti &quot;contributes an extraordinary score, slipping seamlessly from slinky jazz to violin figures to the romantic sweep of a classic Hollywood score,&quot; but stated that Lynch &quot;isn&#x27;t interested in communicating, he&#x27;s interested in parading his personality. The movie doesn&#x27;t progress or deepen, it just gets weirder, and to no good end.&quot; A general criticism from US critics was &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;″s approach to sexuality and violence. They asserted that this detracted from the film&#x27;s seriousness as a work of art, and some condemned the film as pornographic. One of its detractors, Roger Ebert, stated that the large amount of &quot;jokey small-town satire&quot; in the film made it impossible to take its themes seriously. Ebert praised Rossellini&#x27;s performance as &quot;convincing and courageous&quot; but criticized how she was depicted in the film, even accusing David Lynch of misogyny: &quot;degraded, slapped around, humiliated and undressed in front of the camera. And when you ask an actress to endure those experiences, you should keep your side of the bargain by putting her in an important film.&quot; While Ebert in later years came to consider Lynch a great filmmaker, his negative view of &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; remained unchanged after he revisited it in the 21st century.

The film is now widely considered a masterpiece and holds an approval score of 91% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 138 reviews, with an average rating of 8.2/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states: &quot;If audiences walk away from this subversive, surreal shocker not fully understanding the story, they might also walk away with a deeper perception of the potential of film storytelling.&quot; The film also has a score of 75 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 15 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Looking back in his &quot;Guardian/Observer&quot; review, critic Philip French wrote, &quot;The film is wearing well and has attained a classic status without becoming respectable or losing its sense of danger.&quot;

Mark Kermode walked out on the film and gave the film a poor review upon its release, but revised his view of the film over time. In 2016, he remarked, &quot;as a film critic, it taught me that when a film really gets under your skin and really provokes a visceral reaction, you have to be very careful about assessing it ... I didn&#x27;t walk out on &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; because it was a bad film. I walked out on it because it was a really good film. The point was at the time I wasn&#x27;t good enough for it.&quot;

===Accolades===
David Lynch was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director and the Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay for his work on the film. Dennis Hopper was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture for his performance, while Isabella Rossellini won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Female Lead for her performance. Lynch won Best Director and Hopper won Best Supporting Actor at the Los Angeles Film Critics Association awards in 1987. That same year, the film received four National Society of Film Critics awards: Best Film, Best Director (Lynch), Best Cinematography (Frederick Elmes), and Best Supporting Actor (Hopper).

==Home media==
&quot;Blue Velvet&quot; was released on VHS and LaserDisc by Karl-Lorimar Home Video in 1987 and re-issued by Warner Home Video in 1991. After that, it was released on DVD in 2000 and 2002 by MGM Home Entertainment. The film made its Blu-ray debut on November 8, 2011, with a special 25th-anniversary edition featuring never-before-seen deleted scenes. On May 28, 2019, the film was re-released on Blu-ray by the Criterion Collection, featuring a 4K digital restoration, the original stereo soundtrack and other special features, including a behind-the-scenes documentary titled &quot;Blue Velvet Revisited&quot;. Criterion later released the film as a 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray/Blu-Ray combo pack on June 25, 2024.

==Legacy==
Although it initially gained a relatively small theatrical audience in North America and was met with controversy over its artistic merit, &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; soon became the center of a &quot;national firestorm&quot; in 1986, and over time became regarded as an American classic. In the late 1980s, and early 1990s, after its release on videotape, the film became a widely recognized cult film, for its dark depiction of a suburban America. With its many VHS, LaserDisc and DVD releases, the film reached broader American audiences. It marked David Lynch&#x27;s entry into the Hollywood mainstream and Dennis Hopper&#x27;s comeback. Hopper&#x27;s performance as Frank Booth has itself left an imprint on popular culture, with countless tributes, cultural references and parodies. The film&#x27;s success also helped Hollywood address previously censored issues, as &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960) had. &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; has been frequently compared to that ground-breaking film. It has become one of the most significant, well-recognized films of its era, spawning countless imitations and parodies in media. The film&#x27;s dark, stylish and erotic production design has served as a benchmark for a number of films, parodies and even Lynch&#x27;s own later work, notably &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; (1990–91), and &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; (2001). Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine cited it as one of the most &quot;influential American films&quot;, as did Michael Atkinson, who dedicated a book to the film&#x27;s themes and motifs.

&quot;Blue Velvet&quot; now frequently appears in various critical assessments of all-time great films, also ranked as one of the greatest films of the 1980s, one of the best examples of American surrealism and one of the finest examples of David Lynch&#x27;s work. In a poll of 54 American critics ranking the &quot;most outstanding films of the decade&quot;, &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; was placed fourth, behind &quot;Raging Bull&quot; (1980), &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; (1982) and the German film &quot;Wings of Desire&quot; (1987). An &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; book special released in 1999 ranked &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; 37th of the greatest films of all time. The film was ranked by &quot;The Guardian&quot; in its list of the 100 Greatest Films. &quot;Film Four&quot; ranked it on their list of 100 Greatest Films. In a 2007 poll of the online film community held by &quot;Variety&quot;, &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; came in at the 95th-greatest film of all time. &quot;Total Film&quot; ranked &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; as one of the all-time best films in both a critics&#x27; list and a public poll, in 2006 and 2007, respectively. In December 2002, a UK film critics&#x27; poll in &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; ranked the film fifth on their list of the 10 Best Films of the Last 25 Years. In a special &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; issue, 100 new film classics were chosen from 1983 to 2008: &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; was ranked at fourth.

In addition to &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; various &quot;all-time greatest films&quot; rankings, the American Film Institute has awarded the film three honors in its lists: 96th on &quot;100 Years ... 100 Thrills&quot; in 2001, selecting cinema&#x27;s most thrilling moments and ranked Frank Booth 36th of the 50 greatest villains in &quot;100 Years ... 100 Heroes and Villains&quot; in 2003. In June 2008, the AFI revealed its &quot;ten Top Ten&quot;—the best ten films in ten &quot;classic&quot; American film genres—after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; was acknowledged as the eighth best film in the mystery genre. &quot;Premiere&quot; magazine listed Frank Booth, played by Dennis Hopper, as the 54th on its list of &#x27;The 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time&#x27;, calling him one of &quot;the most monstrously funny creations in cinema history&quot;. The film was ranked 84th on Bravo Television&#x27;s four-hour program &quot;100 Scariest Movie Moments&quot; (2004). It is frequently sampled musically and an array of bands and solo artists have taken their names and inspiration from the film. In August 2012, &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; unveiled their latest list of the 250 greatest films of all time, with &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; ranking at 69th.

&quot;Blue Velvet&quot; was also nominated for the following AFI lists:
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Heroes &amp; Villains
** Frank Booth – ranked 36th-greatest film villain
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs:
** &quot;In Dreams&quot; - nominated
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)

Inspired by the film, pop singer Lana Del Rey recorded a cover version of &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; in 2012. Used to endorse clothing line H&amp;M, a music video accompanied the track and aired as a television commercial. Set in post-war America, the video drew influence from Lynch and &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;. In the video, Del Rey plays the role of Dorothy Vallens, performing a private concert similar to the scene where Ben (Dean Stockwell) pantomimes &quot;In Dreams&quot; for Frank Booth. Del Rey&#x27;s version, however, has her lip-syncing &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; when a little person dressed as Frank Sinatra approaches and unplugs a hidden Victrola, revealing Del Rey as a fraud. When Lynch heard of the music video, he praised it, telling &quot;Artinfo&quot;: &quot;Lana Del Rey, she&#x27;s got some fantastic charisma and—this is a very interesting thing—it&#x27;s like she&#x27;s born out of another time. She&#x27;s got something that&#x27;s very appealing to people. And I didn&#x27;t know she was influenced by me!&quot;

<doc id="3948" wikidata="Q164307" url="?curid=3948" title="Binary operation">
<text>In mathematics, a binary operation or dyadic operation is a rule for combining two elements (called operands) to produce another element. More formally, a binary operation is an operation of arity two.

More specifically, a binary operation &quot;on a set&quot; is a binary function whose two domains and the codomain are the same set. Examples include the familiar arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Other examples are readily found in different areas of mathematics, such as vector addition, matrix multiplication, and conjugation in groups.

A binary function that involves several sets is sometimes also called a &quot;binary operation&quot;. For example, scalar multiplication of vector spaces takes a scalar and a vector to produce a vector, and scalar product takes two vectors to produce a scalar.

Binary operations are the keystone of most structures that are studied in algebra, in particular in semigroups, monoids, groups, rings, fields, and vector spaces.

==Terminology==
More precisely, a binary operation on a set formula_1 is a mapping of the elements of the Cartesian product formula_2 to formula_1:
:formula_4
The closure property of a binary operation expresses the existence of a result for the operation given any pair of operands.

If formula_5 is not a function but a partial function, then formula_5 is called a partial binary operation. For instance, division of real numbers is a partial binary operation, because one can not divide by zero: formula_7 is undefined for every real number formula_8. In both model theory and classical universal algebra, binary operations are required to be defined on all elements of formula_2. However, partial algebras generalize universal algebras to allow partial operations.

Sometimes, especially in computer science, the term binary operation is used for any binary function.

== Properties and examples ==
Typical examples of binary operations are the addition (formula_10) and multiplication (formula_11) of numbers and matrices as well as composition of functions on a single set.
For instance,
* On the set of real numbers formula_12, formula_13 is a binary operation since the sum of two real numbers is a real number.
* On the set of natural numbers formula_14, formula_13 is a binary operation since the sum of two natural numbers is a natural number. This is a different binary operation than the previous one since the sets are different.
* On the set formula_16 of formula_17 matrices with real entries, formula_18 is a binary operation since the sum of two such matrices is a formula_17 matrix.
* On the set formula_16 of formula_17 matrices with real entries, formula_22 is a binary operation since the product of two such matrices is a formula_17 matrix.
* For a given set formula_24, let formula_1 be the set of all functions formula_26. Define formula_27 by formula_28 for all formula_29, the composition of the two functions formula_30 and formula_31 in formula_1. Then formula_5 is a binary operation since the composition of the two functions is again a function on the set formula_24 (that is, a member of formula_1).

Many binary operations of interest in both algebra and formal logic are commutative, satisfying formula_36 for all elements formula_8 and formula_38 in formula_1, or associative, satisfying formula_40 for all formula_8, formula_38, and formula_43 in formula_1. Many also have identity elements and inverse elements.

The first three examples above are commutative and all of the above examples are associative.

On the set of real numbers formula_12, subtraction, that is, formula_46, is a binary operation which is not commutative since, in general, formula_47. It is also not associative, since, in general, formula_48; for instance, formula_49 but formula_50.

On the set of natural numbers formula_14, the binary operation exponentiation, formula_52, is not commutative since, formula_53 (cf. Equation xy = yx), and is also not associative since formula_54. For instance, with formula_55, formula_56, and formula_57, formula_58, but formula_59. By changing the set formula_14 to the set of integers formula_61, this binary operation becomes a partial binary operation since it is now undefined when formula_62 and formula_38 is any negative integer. For either set, this operation has a &quot;right identity&quot; (which is formula_64) since formula_65 for all formula_8 in the set, which is not an &quot;identity&quot; (two sided identity) since formula_67 in general.

Division (formula_68), a partial binary operation on the set of real or rational numbers, is not commutative or associative. Tetration (formula_69), as a binary operation on the natural numbers, is not commutative or associative and has no identity element.

==Notation==
Binary operations are often written using infix notation such as formula_70, formula_71, formula_72 or (by juxtaposition with no symbol) formula_73 rather than by functional notation of the form formula_74. Powers are usually also written without operator, but with the second argument as superscript.

Binary operations are sometimes written using prefix or (more frequently) postfix notation, both of which dispense with parentheses. They are also called, respectively, Polish notation formula_75 and reverse Polish notation formula_76.

== Binary operations as ternary relations ==

A binary operation formula_5 on a set formula_1 may be viewed as a ternary relation on formula_1, that is, the set of triples formula_80 in formula_81 for all formula_8 and formula_38 in formula_1.

== Other binary operations ==

For example, scalar multiplication in linear algebra. Here formula_85 is a field and formula_1 is a vector space over that field.

Also the dot product of two vectors maps formula_2 to formula_85, where formula_85 is a field and formula_1 is a vector space over formula_85. It depends on authors whether it is considered as a binary operation.

<doc id="3950" wikidata="Q8347" url="?curid=3950" title="Bagpipes">
<text>Bagpipes are a woodwind instrument using enclosed reeds fed from a constant reservoir of air in the form of a bag. The Great Highland bagpipes are well known, but people have played bagpipes for centuries throughout large parts of Europe, Northern Africa, Western Asia, around the Persian Gulf and northern parts of South Asia.

The term &quot;bagpipe&quot; is equally correct in the singular or the plural, though pipers usually refer to the bagpipes as &quot;the pipes&quot;, &quot;a set of pipes&quot; or &quot;a stand of pipes&quot;.

A set of bagpipes minimally consists of an air supply, a bag, a chanter, and usually at least one drone. Many bagpipes have more than one drone (and, sometimes, more than one chanter) in various combinations, held in place in stocks—sockets that fasten the various pipes to the bag.

=== Air supply ===
The most common method of supplying air to the bag is through blowing into a blowpipe or blowstick. In some pipes the player must cover the tip of the blowpipe with the tongue while inhaling, in order to prevent unwanted deflation of the bag, but most blowpipes have a non-return valve that eliminates this need. In recent times, there are many instruments that assist in creating a clean air flow to the pipes and assist the collection of condensation.

The use of a bellows to supply air is an innovation dating from the 16th or 17th century. In these pipes, sometimes called &quot;cauld wind pipes&quot;, air is not heated or moistened by the player&#x27;s breathing, so bellows-driven bagpipes can use more refined or delicate reeds. Such pipes include the Irish uilleann pipes; the border or Lowland pipes, Scottish smallpipes, Northumbrian smallpipes and pastoral pipes in Britain; the musette de cour, the musette bechonnet and the cabrette in France; and the , koziol bialy, and koziol czarny in Poland.

=== Bag ===
The bag is an airtight reservoir that holds air and regulates its flow via arm pressure, allowing the player to maintain continuous, even sound. The player keeps the bag inflated by blowing air into it through a blowpipe or by pumping air into it with a bellows. Materials used for bags vary widely, but the most common are the skins of local animals such as goats, dogs, sheep, and cows. More recently, bags made of synthetic materials including Gore-Tex have become much more common. Some synthetic bags have zips that allow the player to fit a more effective moisture trap to the inside of the bag. However, synthetic bags still carry a risk of colonisation by fungal spores, and the associated danger of lung infection if they are not kept clean, even if they otherwise require less cleaning than do bags made from natural substances.

Bags cut from larger materials are usually saddle-stitched with an extra strip folded over the seam and stitched (for skin bags) or glued (for synthetic bags) to reduce leaks. Holes are then cut to accommodate the stocks. In the case of bags made from largely intact animal skins, the stocks are typically tied into the points where the limbs and the head joined the body of the whole animal, a construction technique common in Central Europe. Different regions have different ways of treating the hide. The simplest methods involve just the use of salt, while more complex treatments involve milk, flour, and the removal of fur. The hide is normally turned inside out so that the fur is on the inside of the bag, as this helps to reduce the effect of moisture buildup within the bag.

=== Chanter ===
The chanter is the melody pipe, played with two hands. All bagpipes have at least one chanter; some pipes have two chanters, particularly those in North Africa, in the Balkans, and in Southwest Asia. A chanter can be bored internally so that the inside walls are parallel (or &quot;cylindrical&quot;) for its full length, or it can be bored in a conical shape. Popular woods include boxwood, cornel, plum or other fruit wood.

The chanter is usually open-ended, so there is no easy way for the player to stop the pipe from sounding. Thus most bagpipes share a constant legato sound with no rests in the music. Primarily because of this inability to stop playing, technical movements are made to break up notes and to create the illusion of articulation and accents. Because of their importance, these embellishments (or &quot;ornaments&quot;) are often highly technical systems specific to each bagpipe, and take many years of study to master. A few bagpipes (such as the musette de cour, the uilleann pipes, the Northumbrian smallpipes, the piva and the left chanter of the surdelina) have closed ends or stop the end on the player&#x27;s leg, so that when the player &quot;closes&quot; (covers all the holes), the chanter becomes silent.

A practice chanter is a chanter without bag or drones and has a much quieter reed, allowing a player to practice the instrument quietly and with no variables other than playing the chanter.

The term &quot;chanter&quot; is derived from the Latin &quot;cantare&quot;, or &quot;to sing&quot;, much like the modern French verb meaning &quot;to sing&quot;, &quot;&quot;.

A distinctive feature of the gaida&#x27;s chanter (which it shares with a number of other Eastern European bagpipes) is the &quot;flea-hole&quot; (also known as a &quot;mumbler&quot; or &quot;voicer&quot;, &quot;marmorka&quot;) which is covered by the index finger of the left hand. The flea-hole is smaller than the rest and usually consists of a small tube that is made out of metal or a chicken or duck feather. Uncovering the flea-hole raises any note played by a half step, and it is used in creating the musical ornamentation that gives Balkan music its unique character.

Some types of gaida can have a double bored chanter, such as the Serbian three-voiced gajde. It has eight fingerholes: the top four are covered by the thumb and the first three fingers of the left hand, then the four fingers of the right hand cover the remaining four holes.

==== Chanter reed ====
The note from the chanter is produced by a reed installed at its top. The reed may be a single (a reed with one vibrating tongue) or double reed (of two pieces that vibrate against each other). Double reeds are used with both conical- and parallel-bored chanters while single reeds are generally (although not exclusively) limited to parallel-bored chanters. In general, double-reed chanters are found in pipes of Western Europe while single-reed chanters appear in most other regions.

They are made from reed (&quot;arundo donax&quot; or Phragmites), bamboo, or elder. A more modern variant for the reed is a combination of a cotton phenolic (Hgw2082) material from which the body of the reed is made and a clarinet reed cut to size in order to fit the body. These type of reeds produce a louder sound and are not so sensitive to humidity and temperature changes.

=== Drone ===
Most bagpipes have at least one drone, a pipe that generally is not fingered but rather produces a constant harmonizing note throughout play (usually the tonic note of the chanter). Exceptions are generally those pipes that have a double-chanter instead. A drone is most commonly a cylindrically bored tube with a single reed, although drones with double reeds exist. The drone is generally designed in two or more parts with a sliding joint so that the pitch of the drone can be adjusted.

Depending on the type of pipes, the drones may lie over the shoulder, across the arm opposite the bag, or may run parallel to the chanter. Some drones have a tuning screw, which effectively alters the length of the drone by opening a hole, allowing the drone to be tuned to two or more distinct pitches. The tuning screw may also shut off the drone altogether. In most types of pipes with one drone, it is pitched two octaves below the tonic of the chanter. Additional drones often add the octave below and then a drone consonant with the fifth of the chanter.

== History ==

=== Possible ancient origins ===
The evidence for bagpipes prior to the 13th century AD is still uncertain, but several textual and visual clues have been suggested. The &quot;Oxford History of Music&quot; posits that a sculpture of bagpipes has been found on a Hittite slab at Euyuk in Anatolia, dated to 1000 BC. Another interpretation of this sculpture suggests that it instead depicts a pan flute played along with a friction drum.

Several authors identify the ancient Greek (ἀσκός &quot;askos&quot; – wine-skin, αὐλός &quot;aulos&quot; – reed pipe) with the bagpipe. In the 2nd century AD, Suetonius described the Roman emperor Nero as a player of the &quot;tibia utricularis&quot;. Dio Chrysostom wrote in the 1st century of a contemporary sovereign (possibly Nero) who could play a pipe (tibia, Roman reedpipes similar to Greek and Etruscan instruments) with his mouth as well as by tucking a bladder beneath his armpit. Vereno suggests that such instruments, rather than being seen as an independent class, were understood as variants on mouth-blown instruments that used a bag as an alternative blowing aid and that it was not until drones were added in the European Medieval era that bagpipes were seen as a distinct class.

=== Spread and development in Europe ===

In the early part of the second millennium, representation of bagpipes began to appear with frequency in Western European art and iconography. The Cantigas de Santa Maria, written in Galician-Portuguese and compiled in Castile in the mid-13th century, depicts several types of bagpipes. Several illustrations of bagpipes also appear in the &quot;Chronique dite de Baudoin d’Avesnes&quot;, a 13th-century manuscript of northern French origin. Although evidence of bagpipes in the British Isles prior to the 14th century is contested, they are explicitly mentioned in &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; (written around 1380):
Bagpipes were also frequent subjects for carvers of wooden choir stalls in the late 15th and early 16th century throughout Europe, sometimes with animal musicians.

Actual specimens of bagpipes from before the 18th century are extremely rare; however, a substantial number of paintings, carvings, engravings, and manuscript illuminations survive. These artefacts are clear evidence that bagpipes varied widely throughout Europe, and even within individual regions. Many examples of early folk bagpipes in continental Europe can be found in the paintings of Brueghel, Teniers, Jordaens, and Durer.

The earliest known artefact identified as a part of a bagpipe is a chanter found in 1985 at Rostock, Germany, that has been dated to the late 14th century or the first quarter of the 15th century.

The first clear reference to the use of the Scottish Highland bagpipes is from a French history that mentions their use at the Battle of Pinkie in 1547. George Buchanan (1506–82) claimed that bagpipes had replaced the trumpet on the battlefield. This period saw the creation of the &quot;ceòl mór&quot; (great music) of the bagpipe, which reflected its martial origins, with battle tunes, marches, gatherings, salutes and laments. The Highlands of the early 17th century saw the development of piping families including the MacCrimmonds, MacArthurs, MacGregors, and the Mackays of Gairloch.

The earliest Irish mention of the bagpipe is in 1206, approximately thirty years after the Anglo-Norman invasion; another mention attributes their use to Irish troops in Henry VIII&#x27;s siege of Boulogne. Illustrations in the 1581 book &quot;The Image of Irelande&quot; by John Derricke clearly depict a bagpiper. Derricke&#x27;s illustrations are considered to be reasonably faithful depictions of the attire and equipment of the English and Irish population of the 16th century.

The &quot;Battell&quot; sequence from &quot;My Ladye Nevells Booke&quot; (1591) by William Byrd, which probably alludes to the Irish wars of 1578, contains a piece entitled &quot;The bagpipe: &amp; the drone&quot;. In 1760, the first serious study of the Scottish Highland bagpipe and its music was attempted in Joseph MacDonald&#x27;s &quot;Compleat Theory&quot;. A manuscript from the 1730s by a William Dixon of Northumberland contains music that fits the border pipes, a nine-note bellows-blown bagpipe with a chanter similar to that of the modern Great Highland bagpipe. However, the music in Dixon&#x27;s manuscript varied greatly from modern Highland bagpipe tunes, consisting mostly of extended variation sets of common dance tunes. Some of the tunes in the Dixon manuscript correspond to those found in the early 19th century manuscript sources of Northumbrian smallpipe tunes, notably the rare book of 50 tunes, many with variations, by John Peacock.

As Western classical music developed, both in terms of musical sophistication and instrumental technology, bagpipes in many regions fell out of favour because of their limited range and function. This triggered a long, slow decline that continued, in most cases, into the 20th century.

Extensive and documented collections of traditional bagpipes may be found at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, the International Bagpipe Museum in Gijón, Spain, the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford, England and the Morpeth Chantry Bagpipe Museum in Northumberland, and the Musical Instrument Museum in Phoenix, Arizona.

=== Recent history ===
During the 19th and 20th centuries, as a result of the participation of Scottish regiments in British colonial expansion, the bagpipes became well known worldwide. This surge in the bagpipes&#x27; popularity was boosted by large numbers of British Armed Forces pipers which served in World War I and World War II. This coincided with a decline in the popularity of many traditional forms of bagpipe throughout Europe, which began to be displaced by instruments from the classical tradition and later by gramophone and radio.

As pipers were easily identifiable, combat losses were high, estimated at one thousand in World War I. A front line role was prohibited following high losses in the Second Battle of El Alamein in 1943, though a few later instances occurred.

In the United Kingdom and Commonwealth Nations such as Canada, New Zealand and Australia, the Great Highland bagpipe is commonly used in the military and is often played during formal ceremonies. Foreign militaries patterned after the British army have also adopted the Highland bagpipe, including those of Uganda, Sudan, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Jordan, and Oman. Many police and fire services in Scotland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and the United States have also adopted the tradition of fielding pipe bands.

In recent years, often driven by revivals of native folk music and dance, many types of bagpipes have enjoyed a resurgence in popularity and, in many cases, instruments that had fallen into obscurity have become extremely popular. In Brittany, the Great Highland bagpipe and concept of the pipe band were appropriated to create a Breton interpretation known as the bagad. The pipe-band idiom has also been adopted and applied to the Galician gaita as well. Bagpipes have often been used in various films depicting moments from Scottish and Irish history; the film &quot;Braveheart&quot; and the theatrical show &quot;Riverdance&quot; have served to make the uilleann pipes more commonly known.

Bagpipes are sometimes played at formal events at Commonwealth universities, particularly in Canada. Because of Scottish influences on the sport of curling, bagpipes are also the official instrument of the World Curling Federation and are commonly played during a ceremonial procession of teams before major curling championships.

Bagpipe making was once a craft that produced instruments in many distinctive, local and traditional styles. Today, the world&#x27;s largest producer of the instrument is Pakistan, where the industry was worth $6.8 million in 2010. In the late 20th century, various models of electronic bagpipes were invented. The first custom-built MIDI bagpipes were developed by the Asturian piper known as Hevia (José Ángel Hevia Velasco).

Astronaut Kjell N. Lindgren is thought to be the first person to play the bagpipes in outer space, having played &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; in tribute to late research scientist Victor Hurst aboard the International Space Station in November 2015.

Traditionally, one of the purposes of the bagpipe was to provide music for dancing. This has declined with the growth of dance bands, recordings, and the decline of traditional dance. In turn, this has led to many types of pipes developing a performance-led tradition, and indeed much modern music based on the dance music tradition played on bagpipes is suitable for use as dance music.

== Modern usage ==
=== Types of bagpipes ===
Numerous types of bagpipes today are widely spread across Europe, the Middle East and North Africa as well as through much of the former British Empire. The name bagpipe has almost become synonymous with its best-known form, the Great Highland bagpipe, overshadowing the great number and variety of traditional forms of bagpipe. Despite the decline of these other types of pipes over the last few centuries, in recent years many of these pipes have seen a resurgence or revival as musicians have sought them out; for example, the Irish piping tradition, which by the mid 20th century had declined to a handful of master players is today alive, well, and flourishing, a situation similar to that of the Asturian gaita, the Galician gaita, the Portuguese gaita transmontana, the Aragonese gaita de boto, Northumbrian smallpipes, the Breton biniou, the Balkan gaida, the Romanian cimpoi, the Black Sea tulum, the Scottish smallpipes and pastoral pipes, as well as other varieties. Bulgaria has the Kaba gaida, a large bagpipe of the Rhodope mountains with a hexagonal and rounded drone, often described as a deep-sounding gaida and the Dzhura gaida with a straight conical drone and of a higher pitch. The Macedonian gaida is structurally between a kaba and dzhura gaida and described as a medium pitched gaida.

In Southeastern Europe and Eastern Europe bagpipes known as gaida include: the , , (), () () or (), (&quot;&quot;), , also and .

In Tunisia, it is known by the name &quot;mezwed&quot;. It is used in the Tunisian pop music genre, also called mezwed, that is named after the instrument.

=== Usage in non-traditional music ===

Since the 1960s, bagpipes have also made appearances in other forms of music, including rock, metal, jazz, hip-hop, punk, and classical music, for example with Paul McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Mull of Kintyre&quot;, AC/DC&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll)&quot;, and Peter Maxwell Davies&#x27;s composition &quot;An Orkney Wedding, with Sunrise&quot;.

<text>Bedrock Records is an English record label for trance, progressive house and techno started by John Digweed. Its name comes from a long running and successful club night held in Hastings and also at Heaven nightclub, London – both also called Bedrock. Bedrock Records has released many singles from artists such as Astro &amp; Glyde, Brancaccio &amp; Aisher, Steve Lawler, Shmuel Flash, Steve Porter, Sahar Z, Guy J, Henry Saiz, Stelios Vassiloudis, Electric Rescue, The Japanese Popstars and Jerry Bonham. Bedrock is also the name that Digweed and Muir use as their production moniker.

Bedrock has had different imprints: Bedrock Breaks, B_Rock and Black (Bedrock). Currently it has Bedrock Digital and one called Lost &amp; Found belonging to Guy J.

The first Bedrock album compiled and mixed by John Digweed was released in 1999, containing several tracks signed to the Bedrock label. 

In 2018, Digweed marked the 20th anniversary of the label with the release of &quot;Bedrock XX&quot;.

<doc id="3954" wikidata="Q7094" url="?curid=3954" title="Biochemistry">
<text>Biochemistry, or biological chemistry, is the study of chemical processes within and relating to living organisms. A sub-discipline of both chemistry and biology, biochemistry may be divided into three fields: structural biology, enzymology, and metabolism. Over the last decades of the 20th century, biochemistry has become successful at explaining living processes through these three disciplines. Almost all areas of the life sciences are being uncovered and developed through biochemical methodology and research. Biochemistry focuses on understanding the chemical basis that allows biological molecules to give rise to the processes that occur within living cells and between cells, in turn relating greatly to the understanding of tissues and organs as well as organism structure and function. Biochemistry is closely related to molecular biology, the study of the molecular mechanisms of biological phenomena.

Much of biochemistry deals with the structures, functions, and interactions of biological macromolecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids. They provide the structure of cells and perform many of the functions associated with life. The chemistry of the cell also depends upon the reactions of small molecules and ions. These can be inorganic (for example, water and metal ions) or organic (for example, the amino acids, which are used to synthesize proteins). The mechanisms used by cells to harness energy from their environment via chemical reactions are known as metabolism. The findings of biochemistry are applied primarily in medicine, nutrition, and agriculture. In medicine, biochemists investigate the causes and cures of diseases. Nutrition studies how to maintain health and wellness and also the effects of nutritional deficiencies. In agriculture, biochemists investigate soil and fertilizers with the goal of improving crop cultivation, crop storage, and pest control. In recent decades, biochemical principles and methods have been combined with problem-solving approaches from engineering to manipulate living systems in order to produce useful tools for research, industrial processes, and diagnosis and control of diseasethe discipline of biotechnology.

==History==

At its most comprehensive definition, biochemistry can be seen as a study of the components and composition of living things and how they come together to become life. In this sense, the history of biochemistry may therefore go back as far as the ancient Greeks. However, biochemistry as a specific scientific discipline began sometime in the 19th century, or a little earlier, depending on which aspect of biochemistry is being focused on. Some argued that the beginning of biochemistry may have been the discovery of the first enzyme, diastase (now called amylase), in 1833 by Anselme Payen, while others considered Eduard Buchner&#x27;s first demonstration of a complex biochemical process alcoholic fermentation in cell-free extracts in 1897 to be the birth of biochemistry. Some might also point as its beginning to the influential 1842 work by Justus von Liebig, &quot;Animal chemistry, or, Organic chemistry in its applications to physiology and pathology&quot;, which presented a chemical theory of metabolism, or even earlier to the 18th century studies on fermentation and respiration by Antoine Lavoisier. Many other pioneers in the field who helped to uncover the layers of complexity of biochemistry have been proclaimed founders of modern biochemistry. Emil Fischer, who studied the chemistry of proteins, and F. Gowland Hopkins, who studied enzymes and the dynamic nature of biochemistry, represent two examples of early biochemists.

The term &quot;biochemistry&quot; was first used when Vinzenz Kletzinsky (1826–1882) had his &quot;Compendium der Biochemie&quot; printed in Vienna in 1858; it derived from a combination of biology and chemistry. In 1877, Felix Hoppe-Seyler used the term ( in German) as a synonym for physiological chemistry in the foreword to the first issue of &quot;Zeitschrift für Physiologische Chemie&quot; (Journal of Physiological Chemistry) where he argued for the setting up of institutes dedicated to this field of study. The German chemist Carl Neuberg however is often cited to have coined the word in 1903, while some credited it to Franz Hofmeister.
It was once generally believed that life and its materials had some essential property or substance (often referred to as the &quot;vital principle&quot;) distinct from any found in non-living matter, and it was thought that only living beings could produce the molecules of life. In 1828, Friedrich Wöhler published a paper on his serendipitous urea synthesis from potassium cyanate and ammonium sulfate; some regarded that as a direct overthrow of vitalism and the establishment of organic chemistry. However, the Wöhler synthesis has sparked controversy as some reject the death of vitalism at his hands. Since then, biochemistry has advanced, especially since the mid-20th century, with the development of new techniques such as chromatography, X-ray diffraction, dual polarisation interferometry, NMR spectroscopy, radioisotopic labeling, electron microscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. These techniques allowed for the discovery and detailed analysis of many molecules and metabolic pathways of the cell, such as glycolysis and the Krebs cycle (citric acid cycle), and led to an understanding of biochemistry on a molecular level.

Another significant historic event in biochemistry is the discovery of the gene, and its role in the transfer of information in the cell. In the 1950s, James D. Watson, Francis Crick, Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins were instrumental in solving DNA structure and suggesting its relationship with the genetic transfer of information. In 1958, George Beadle and Edward Tatum received the Nobel Prize for work in fungi showing that one gene produces one enzyme. In 1988, Colin Pitchfork was the first person convicted of murder with DNA evidence, which led to the growth of forensic science. More recently, Andrew Z. Fire and Craig C. Mello received the 2006 Nobel Prize for discovering the role of RNA interference (RNAi) in the silencing of gene expression.

== Starting materials: the chemical elements of life ==

Around two dozen chemical elements are essential to various kinds of biological life. Most rare elements on Earth are not needed by life (exceptions being selenium and iodine), while a few common ones (aluminum and titanium) are not used. Most organisms share element needs, but there are a few differences between plants and animals. For example, ocean algae use bromine, but land plants and animals do not seem to need any. All animals require sodium, but is not an essential element for plants. Plants need boron and silicon, but animals may not (or may need ultra-small amounts).

Just six elements—carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, calcium and phosphorus—make up almost 99% of the mass of living cells, including those in the human body (see composition of the human body for a complete list). In addition to the six major elements that compose most of the human body, humans require smaller amounts of possibly 18 more.

==Biomolecules==

The 4 main classes of molecules in biochemistry (often called biomolecules) are carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Many biological molecules are polymers: in this terminology, monomers are relatively small macromolecules that are linked together to create large macromolecules known as polymers. When monomers are linked together to synthesize a biological polymer, they undergo a process called dehydration synthesis. Different macromolecules can assemble in larger complexes, often needed for biological activity.

===Carbohydrates===
Two of the main functions of carbohydrates are energy storage and providing structure. One of the common sugars known as glucose is a carbohydrate, but not all carbohydrates are sugars. There are more carbohydrates on Earth than any other known type of biomolecule; they are used to store energy and genetic information, as well as play important roles in cell to cell interactions and communications.

The simplest type of carbohydrate is a monosaccharide, which among other properties contains carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, mostly in a ratio of 1:2:1 (generalized formula C&quot;n&quot;H2&quot;n&quot;O&quot;n&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; is at least 3). Glucose (C6H12O6) is one of the most important carbohydrates; others include fructose (C6H12O6), the sugar commonly associated with the sweet taste of fruits, and deoxyribose (C5H10O4), a component of DNA. A monosaccharide can switch between acyclic (open-chain) form and a cyclic form. The open-chain form can be turned into a ring of carbon atoms bridged by an oxygen atom created from the carbonyl group of one end and the hydroxyl group of another. The cyclic molecule has a hemiacetal or hemiketal group, depending on whether the linear form was an aldose or a ketose.

In these cyclic forms, the ring usually has 5 or 6 atoms. These forms are called furanoses and pyranoses, respectively—by analogy with furan and pyran, the simplest compounds with the same carbon-oxygen ring (although they lack the carbon-carbon double bonds of these two molecules). For example, the aldohexose glucose may form a hemiacetal linkage between the hydroxyl on carbon 1 and the oxygen on carbon 4, yielding a molecule with a 5-membered ring, called glucofuranose. The same reaction can take place between carbons 1 and 5 to form a molecule with a 6-membered ring, called glucopyranose. Cyclic forms with a 7-atom ring called heptoses are rare.

Two monosaccharides can be joined by a glycosidic or ester bond into a &quot;disaccharide&quot; through a dehydration reaction during which a molecule of water is released. The reverse reaction in which the glycosidic bond of a disaccharide is broken into two monosaccharides is termed &quot;hydrolysis&quot;. The best-known disaccharide is sucrose or ordinary sugar, which consists of a glucose molecule and a fructose molecule joined. Another important disaccharide is lactose found in milk, consisting of a glucose molecule and a galactose molecule. Lactose may be hydrolysed by lactase, and deficiency in this enzyme results in lactose intolerance.

When a few (around three to six) monosaccharides are joined, it is called an &quot;oligosaccharide&quot; (&quot;oligo-&quot; meaning &quot;few&quot;). These molecules tend to be used as markers and signals, as well as having some other uses. Many monosaccharides joined form a polysaccharide. They can be joined in one long linear chain, or they may be branched. Two of the most common polysaccharides are cellulose and glycogen, both consisting of repeating glucose monomers. &quot;Cellulose&quot; is an important structural component of plant&#x27;s cell walls and &quot;glycogen&quot; is used as a form of energy storage in animals.

Sugar can be characterized by having reducing or non-reducing ends. A reducing end of a carbohydrate is a carbon atom that can be in equilibrium with the open-chain aldehyde (aldose) or keto form (ketose). If the joining of monomers takes place at such a carbon atom, the free hydroxy group of the pyranose or furanose form is exchanged with an OH-side-chain of another sugar, yielding a full acetal. This prevents opening of the chain to the aldehyde or keto form and renders the modified residue non-reducing. Lactose contains a reducing end at its glucose moiety, whereas the galactose moiety forms a full acetal with the C4-OH group of glucose. Saccharose does not have a reducing end because of full acetal formation between the aldehyde carbon of glucose (C1) and the keto carbon of fructose (C2).

===Lipids===


Lipids comprise a diverse range of molecules and to some extent is a catchall for relatively water-insoluble or nonpolar compounds of biological origin, including waxes, fatty acids, fatty-acid derived phospholipids, sphingolipids, glycolipids, and terpenoids (e.g., retinoids and steroids). Some lipids are linear, open-chain aliphatic molecules, while others have ring structures. Some are aromatic (with a cyclic [ring] and planar [flat] structure) while others are not. Some are flexible, while others are rigid.

Lipids are usually made from one molecule of glycerol combined with other molecules. In triglycerides, the main group of bulk lipids, there is one molecule of glycerol and three fatty acids. Fatty acids are considered the monomer in that case, and may be saturated (no double bonds in the carbon chain) or unsaturated (one or more double bonds in the carbon chain).

Most lipids have some polar character and are largely nonpolar. In general, the bulk of their structure is nonpolar or hydrophobic (&quot;water-fearing&quot;), meaning that it does not interact well with polar solvents like water. Another part of their structure is polar or hydrophilic (&quot;water-loving&quot;) and will tend to associate with polar solvents like water. This makes them amphiphilic molecules (having both hydrophobic and hydrophilic portions). In the case of cholesterol, the polar group is a mere –OH (hydroxyl or alcohol). 

In the case of phospholipids, the polar groups are considerably larger and more polar, as described below.

Lipids are an integral part of our daily diet. Most oils and milk products that we use for cooking and eating like butter, cheese, ghee etc. are composed of fats. Vegetable oils are rich in various polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Lipid-containing foods undergo digestion within the body and are broken into fatty acids and glycerol, the final degradation products of fats and lipids. Lipids, especially phospholipids, are also used in various pharmaceutical products, either as co-solubilizers (e.g. in parenteral infusions) or else as drug carrier components (e.g. in a liposome or transfersome).

===Proteins===


Proteins are very large molecules—macro-biopolymers—made from monomers called amino acids. An amino acid consists of an alpha carbon atom attached to an amino group, –NH2, a carboxylic acid group, –COOH (although these exist as –NH3+ and –COO− under physiologic conditions), a simple hydrogen atom, and a side chain commonly denoted as &quot;–R&quot;. The side chain &quot;R&quot; is different for each amino acid of which there are 20 standard ones. It is this &quot;R&quot; group that makes each amino acid different, and the properties of the side chains greatly influence the overall three-dimensional conformation of a protein. Some amino acids have functions by themselves or in a modified form; for instance, glutamate functions as an important neurotransmitter. Amino acids can be joined via a peptide bond. In this dehydration synthesis, a water molecule is removed and the peptide bond connects the nitrogen of one amino acid&#x27;s amino group to the carbon of the other&#x27;s carboxylic acid group. The resulting molecule is called a &quot;dipeptide&quot;, and short stretches of amino acids (usually, fewer than thirty) are called &quot;peptides&quot; or polypeptides. Longer stretches merit the title &quot;proteins&quot;. As an example, the important blood serum protein albumin contains 585 amino acid residues.

Proteins can have structural and/or functional roles. For instance, movements of the proteins actin and myosin ultimately are responsible for the contraction of skeletal muscle. One property many proteins have is that they specifically bind to a certain molecule or class of molecules—they may be &quot;extremely&quot; selective in what they bind. Antibodies are an example of proteins that attach to one specific type of molecule. Antibodies are composed of heavy and light chains. Two heavy chains would be linked to two light chains through disulfide linkages between their amino acids. Antibodies are specific through variation based on differences in the N-terminal domain.

The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which uses antibodies, is one of the most sensitive tests modern medicine uses to detect various biomolecules. Probably the most important proteins, however, are the enzymes. Virtually every reaction in a living cell requires an enzyme to lower the activation energy of the reaction. These molecules recognize specific reactant molecules called &quot;substrates&quot;; they then catalyze the reaction between them. By lowering the activation energy, the enzyme speeds up that reaction by a rate of 1011 or more; a reaction that would normally take over 3,000 years to complete spontaneously might take less than a second with an enzyme. The enzyme itself is not used up in the process and is free to catalyze the same reaction with a new set of substrates. Using various modifiers, the activity of the enzyme can be regulated, enabling control of the biochemistry of the cell as a whole.

The structure of proteins is traditionally described in a hierarchy of four levels. The primary structure of a protein consists of its linear sequence of amino acids; for instance, &quot;alanine-glycine-tryptophan-serine-glutamate-asparagine-glycine-lysine-...&quot;. Secondary structure is concerned with local morphology (morphology being the study of structure). Some combinations of amino acids will tend to curl up in a coil called an α-helix or into a sheet called a β-sheet; some α-helixes can be seen in the hemoglobin schematic above. Tertiary structure is the entire three-dimensional shape of the protein. This shape is determined by the sequence of amino acids. In fact, a single change can change the entire structure. The alpha chain of hemoglobin contains 146 amino acid residues; substitution of the glutamate residue at position 6 with a valine residue changes the behavior of hemoglobin so much that it results in sickle-cell disease. Finally, quaternary structure is concerned with the structure of a protein with multiple peptide subunits, like hemoglobin with its four subunits. Not all proteins have more than one subunit.

Ingested proteins are usually broken up into single amino acids or dipeptides in the small intestine and then absorbed. They can then be joined to form new proteins. Intermediate products of glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the pentose phosphate pathway can be used to form all twenty amino acids, and most bacteria and plants possess all the necessary enzymes to synthesize them. Humans and other mammals, however, can synthesize only half of them. They cannot synthesize isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. Because they must be ingested, these are the essential amino acids. Mammals do possess the enzymes to synthesize alanine, asparagine, aspartate, cysteine, glutamate, glutamine, glycine, proline, serine, and tyrosine, the nonessential amino acids. While they can synthesize arginine and histidine, they cannot produce it in sufficient amounts for young, growing animals, and so these are often considered essential amino acids.

If the amino group is removed from an amino acid, it leaves behind a carbon skeleton called an α-keto acid. Enzymes called transaminases can easily transfer the amino group from one amino acid (making it an α-keto acid) to another α-keto acid (making it an amino acid). This is important in the biosynthesis of amino acids, as for many of the pathways, intermediates from other biochemical pathways are converted to the α-keto acid skeleton, and then an amino group is added, often via transamination. The amino acids may then be linked together to form a protein.

A similar process is used to break down proteins. It is first hydrolyzed into its component amino acids. Free ammonia (NH3), existing as the ammonium ion (NH4+) in blood, is toxic to life forms. A suitable method for excreting it must therefore exist. Different tactics have evolved in different animals, depending on the animals&#x27; needs. Unicellular organisms release the ammonia into the environment. Likewise, bony fish can release ammonia into the water where it is quickly diluted. In general, mammals convert ammonia into urea, via the urea cycle.

In order to determine whether two proteins are related, or in other words to decide whether they are homologous or not, scientists use sequence-comparison methods. Methods like sequence alignments and structural alignments are powerful tools that help scientists identify homologies between related molecules. The relevance of finding homologies among proteins goes beyond forming an evolutionary pattern of protein families. By finding how similar two protein sequences are, we acquire knowledge about their structure and therefore their function.

===Nucleic acids===

Nucleic acids, so-called because of their prevalence in cellular nuclei, is the generic name of the family of biopolymers. They are complex, high-molecular-weight biochemical macromolecules that can convey genetic information in all living cells and viruses. The monomers are called nucleotides, and each consists of three components: a nitrogenous heterocyclic base (either a purine or a pyrimidine), a pentose sugar, and a phosphate group.

The most common nucleic acids are deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). The phosphate group and the sugar of each nucleotide bond with each other to form the backbone of the nucleic acid, while the sequence of nitrogenous bases stores the information. The most common nitrogenous bases are adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil. The nitrogenous bases of each strand of a nucleic acid will form hydrogen bonds with certain other nitrogenous bases in a complementary strand of nucleic acid. Adenine binds with thymine and uracil, thymine binds only with adenine, and cytosine and guanine can bind only with one another. Adenine, thymine, and uracil contain two hydrogen bonds, while hydrogen bonds formed between cytosine and guanine are three.

Aside from the genetic material of the cell, nucleic acids often play a role as second messengers, as well as forming the base molecule for adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy-carrier molecule found in all living organisms. Also, the nitrogenous bases possible in the two nucleic acids are different: adenine, cytosine, and guanine occur in both RNA and DNA, while thymine occurs only in DNA and uracil occurs in RNA.

==Metabolism==

===Carbohydrates as energy source===

Glucose is an energy source in most life forms. For instance, polysaccharides are broken down into their monomers by enzymes (glycogen phosphorylase removes glucose residues from glycogen, a polysaccharide). Disaccharides like lactose or sucrose are cleaved into their two component monosaccharides.

====Glycolysis (anaerobic)====

Glucose is mainly metabolized by a very important ten-step pathway called glycolysis, the net result of which is to break down one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate. This also produces a net two molecules of ATP, the energy currency of cells, along with two reducing equivalents of converting NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide: oxidized form) to NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide: reduced form). This does not require oxygen; if no oxygen is available (or the cell cannot use oxygen), the NAD is restored by converting the pyruvate to lactate (lactic acid) (e.g. in humans) or to ethanol plus carbon dioxide (e.g. in yeast). Other monosaccharides like galactose and fructose can be converted into intermediates of the glycolytic pathway.

====Aerobic====
In aerobic cells with sufficient oxygen, as in most human cells, the pyruvate is further metabolized. It is irreversibly converted to acetyl-CoA, giving off one carbon atom as the waste product carbon dioxide, generating another reducing equivalent as NADH. The two molecules acetyl-CoA (from one molecule of glucose) then enter the citric acid cycle, producing two molecules of ATP, six more NADH molecules and two reduced (ubi)quinones (via FADH2 as enzyme-bound cofactor), and releasing the remaining carbon atoms as carbon dioxide. The produced NADH and quinol molecules then feed into the enzyme complexes of the respiratory chain, an electron transport system transferring the electrons ultimately to oxygen and conserving the released energy in the form of a proton gradient over a membrane (inner mitochondrial membrane in eukaryotes). Thus, oxygen is reduced to water and the original electron acceptors NAD+ and quinone are regenerated. This is why humans breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide. The energy released from transferring the electrons from high-energy states in NADH and quinol is conserved first as proton gradient and converted to ATP via ATP synthase. This generates an additional &quot;28&quot; molecules of ATP (24 from the 8 NADH + 4 from the 2 quinols), totaling to 32 molecules of ATP conserved per degraded glucose (two from glycolysis + two from the citrate cycle). It is clear that using oxygen to completely oxidize glucose provides an organism with far more energy than any oxygen-independent metabolic feature, and this is thought to be the reason why complex life appeared only after Earth&#x27;s atmosphere accumulated large amounts of oxygen.

====Gluconeogenesis====

In vertebrates, vigorously contracting skeletal muscles (during weightlifting or sprinting, for example) do not receive enough oxygen to meet the energy demand, and so they shift to anaerobic metabolism, converting glucose to lactate.
The combination of glucose from noncarbohydrates origin, such as fat and proteins. This only happens when glycogen supplies in the liver are worn out. The pathway is a crucial reversal of glycolysis from pyruvate to glucose and can use many sources like amino acids, glycerol and Krebs Cycle. Large scale protein and fat catabolism usually occur when those suffer from starvation or certain endocrine disorders. The liver regenerates the glucose, using a process called gluconeogenesis. This process is not quite the opposite of glycolysis, and actually requires three times the amount of energy gained from glycolysis (six molecules of ATP are used, compared to the two gained in glycolysis). Analogous to the above reactions, the glucose produced can then undergo glycolysis in tissues that need energy, be stored as glycogen (or starch in plants), or be converted to other monosaccharides or joined into di- or oligosaccharides. The combined pathways of glycolysis during exercise, lactate&#x27;s crossing via the bloodstream to the liver, subsequent gluconeogenesis and release of glucose into the bloodstream is called the Cori cycle.

==Relationship to other &quot;molecular-scale&quot; biological sciences==

Researchers in biochemistry use specific techniques native to biochemistry, but increasingly combine these with techniques and ideas developed in the fields of genetics, molecular biology, and biophysics. There is not a defined line between these disciplines. Biochemistry studies the chemistry required for biological activity of molecules, molecular biology studies their biological activity, genetics studies their heredity, which happens to be carried by their genome. This is shown in the following schematic that depicts one possible view of the relationships between the fields:
* Biochemistry is the study of the chemical substances and vital processes occurring in live organisms. Biochemists focus heavily on the role, function, and structure of biomolecules. The study of the chemistry behind biological processes and the synthesis of biologically active molecules are applications of biochemistry. Biochemistry studies life at the atomic and molecular level.
* Genetics is the study of the effect of genetic differences in organisms. This can often be inferred by the absence of a normal component (e.g. one gene). The study of &quot;mutants&quot; – organisms that lack one or more functional components with respect to the so-called &quot;wild type&quot; or normal phenotype. Genetic interactions (epistasis) can often confound simple interpretations of such &quot;knockout&quot; studies.
* Molecular biology is the study of molecular underpinnings of the biological phenomena, focusing on molecular synthesis, modification, mechanisms and interactions. The central dogma of molecular biology, where genetic material is transcribed into RNA and then translated into protein, despite being oversimplified, still provides a good starting point for understanding the field. This concept has been revised in light of emerging novel roles for RNA.
* Chemical biology seeks to develop new tools based on small molecules that allow minimal perturbation of biological systems while providing detailed information about their function. Further, chemical biology employs biological systems to create non-natural hybrids between biomolecules and synthetic devices (for example emptied viral capsids that can deliver gene therapy or drug molecules).

<text>Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are &quot;singles&quot; (with one player per side) and &quot;doubles&quot; (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; professional games are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the other team&#x27;s half of the court, within the set boundaries.

Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. Play ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor or ground, or if a fault has been called by the umpire, service judge, or (in their absence) the opposing side.

The shuttlecock is a feathered or (in informal matches) plastic projectile that flies differently from the balls used in many other sports. In particular, the feathers create much higher drag, causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly. Shuttlecocks also have a high top speed compared to the balls in other racquet sports, making badminton the fastest racquet sport in the world. The flight of the shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive nature, and in certain languages the sport is named by reference to this feature (e.g., German , literally feather-ball).

The game developed in British India from the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock. European play came to be dominated by Denmark but the game has become very popular in Asia, with recent competitions dominated by China. In 1992, badminton debuted as a Summer Olympic sport with four events: men&#x27;s singles, women&#x27;s singles, men&#x27;s doubles, and women&#x27;s doubles; mixed doubles was added four years later. At high levels of play, the sport demands excellent fitness: players require aerobic stamina, agility, strength, speed, and precision. It is also a technical sport, requiring good motor coordination and the development of sophisticated racquet movements involving much greater flexibility in the wrist than some other racquet sports.

==History==

Games employing shuttlecocks have been played for centuries across Eurasia, but the modern game of badminton developed in the mid-19th century among the expatriate officers of British India as a variant of the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock. (&quot;Battledore&quot; was an older term for &quot;racquet&quot;.) Its exact origin remains obscure. The name derives from the Duke of Beaufort&#x27;s Badminton House in Gloucestershire, but why or when remains unclear. As early as 1860, a London toy dealer named Isaac Spratt published a booklet entitled &quot;Badminton Battledore – A New Game&quot;, but no copy is known to have survived. An 1863 article in &quot;The Cornhill Magazine&quot; describes badminton as &quot;battledore and shuttlecock played with sides, across a string suspended some five feet from the ground&quot;.

The game originally developed in India among the British expatriates, where it was very popular by the 1870s. Ball badminton, a form of the game played with a wool ball instead of a shuttlecock, was being played in Thanjavur as early as the 1850s and was at first played interchangeably with badminton by the British, the woollen ball being preferred in windy or wet weather.

Early on, the game was also known as Poona or Poonah after the garrison town of Poona (Pune), where it was particularly popular and where the first rules for the game were drawn up in 1873. By 1875, officers returning home had started a badminton club in Folkestone. Initially, the sport was played with sides ranging from 1 to 4 players, but it was quickly established that games between two or four competitors worked the best. The shuttlecocks were coated with India rubber and, in outdoor play, sometimes weighted with lead. Although the depth of the net was of no consequence, it was preferred that it should reach the ground.
The sport was played under the Pune rules until 1887, when J. H. E. Hart of the Bath Badminton Club drew up revised regulations. In 1890, Hart and Bagnel Wild again revised the rules. The Badminton Association of England (BAE) published these rules in 1893 and officially launched the sport at a house called &quot;Dunbar&quot; in Portsmouth on 13 September. The BAE started the first badminton competition, the All England Open Badminton Championships for gentlemen&#x27;s doubles, ladies&#x27; doubles, and mixed doubles, in 1899. Singles competitions were added in 1900 and an England–Ireland championship match appeared in 1904.

England, Scotland, Wales, Canada, Denmark, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, and New Zealand were the founding members of the International Badminton Federation in 1934, now known as the Badminton World Federation. India joined as an affiliate in 1936. The BWF now governs international badminton. Although initiated in England, competitive men&#x27;s badminton has traditionally been dominated in Europe by Denmark. Worldwide, Asian nations have become dominant in international competition. China, Denmark, Indonesia, Malaysia, India, South Korea, Taiwan (playing as &#x27;Chinese Taipei&#x27;) and Japan are the nations which have consistently produced world-class players in the past few decades, with China being the greatest force in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s competition recently. Great Britain, where the rules of the modern game were codified, is not among the top powers in the sport, but has had significant Olympic and World success in doubles play, especially mixed doubles.

The game has also become a popular backyard sport in the United States.

==Rules==

The following information is a simplified summary of badminton rules based on the BWF Statutes publication, &quot;Laws of Badminton&quot;.

===Court===

The court is rectangular and divided into halves by a net. Courts are usually marked for both singles and doubles play, although badminton rules permit a court to be marked for singles only. The doubles court is wider than the singles court, but both are of the same length. The exception, which often causes confusion to newer players, is that the doubles court has a shorter serve-length dimension.

The full width of the court is , and in singles this width is reduced to . The full length of the court is . The service courts are marked by a centre line dividing the width of the court, by a short service line at a distance of from the net, and by the outer side and back boundaries. In doubles, the service court is also marked by a long service line, which is from the back boundary.

The net is high at the edges and high in the centre. The net posts are placed over the doubles sidelines, even when singles is played.

The minimum height for the ceiling above the court is not mentioned in the Laws of Badminton. Nonetheless, a badminton court will not be suitable if the ceiling is likely to be hit on a high serve.

===Serving===

When the server serves, the shuttlecock must pass over the short service line on the opponents&#x27; court or it will count as a fault. The server and receiver must remain within their service courts, without touching the boundary lines, until the server strikes the shuttlecock. The other two players may stand wherever they wish, so long as they do not block the vision of the server or receiver.

At the start of the rally, the server and receiver stand in diagonally opposite &quot;service courts&quot; (see court dimensions). The server hits the shuttlecock so that it would land in the receiver&#x27;s service court. This is similar to tennis, except that in a badminton serve the whole shuttle must be below 1.15 metres from the surface of the court at the instant of being hit by the server&#x27;s racket, the shuttlecock is not allowed to bounce and in badminton, the players stand inside their service courts, unlike tennis.

When the serving side loses a rally, the server immediately passes to their opponent(s) (this differs from the old system where sometimes the serve passes to the doubles partner for what is known as a &quot;second serve&quot;).

In singles, the server stands in their right service court when their score is even, and in their left service court when their score is odd.

In doubles, if the serving side wins a rally, the same player continues to serve, but he/she changes service courts so that she/he serves to a different opponent each time. If the opponents win the rally and their new score is even, the player in the right service court serves; if odd, the player in the left service court serves. The players&#x27; service courts are determined by their positions at the start of the previous rally, not by where they were standing at the end of the rally. A consequence of this system is that each time a side regains the service, the server will be the player who did &quot;not&quot; serve last time.

===Scoring===
Each game is played to 21 points, with players scoring a point by winning a rally. This differs from the old system in which players may only win a point on their serve and each game is to 15 points. A match is the best of three games.

If the score ties at 20–20, then the game continues until one side gains a two-point lead (such as 24–22), except when there is a tie at 29–29, in which the game goes to a golden point of 30. Whoever scores this point wins the game.

At the start of a match, the shuttlecock is cast and the side towards which the shuttlecock is pointing serves first. Alternatively, a coin may be tossed, with the winners choosing whether to serve or receive first, or choosing which end of the court to occupy first, and their opponents making the remaining choice.

In subsequent games, the winners of the previous game serve first. Matches are best out of three: a player or pair must win two games (of 21 points each) to win the match. For the first rally of any doubles game, the serving pair may decide who serves and the receiving pair may decide who receives. The players change ends at the start of the second game; if the match reaches a third game, they change ends both at the start of the game and when the leading player&#x27;s or pair&#x27;s score reaches 11 points.

A new scoring system is being attempted by the BWF, in which the 21x3 scoring system may be replaced with 15x3. The move itself has been very controversial amongst several badminton players.

===Lets===

If a let is called, the rally is stopped and replayed with no change to the score. Lets may occur because of some unexpected disturbance such as a shuttlecock landing on a court (having been hit there by players playing in adjacent court) or in small halls the shuttle may touch an overhead rail which can be classed as a let.

If the receiver is not ready when the service is delivered, a let shall be called; yet, if the receiver attempts to return the shuttlecock, the receiver shall be judged to have been ready.

==Equipment==

Badminton rules restrict the design and size of racquets and shuttlecocks.

===Racquets===

Badminton racquets are lightweight, with top quality racquets weighing between not including grip or strings. They are composed of many different materials ranging from carbon fibre composite (graphite reinforced plastic) to solid steel, which may be augmented by a variety of materials. Carbon fibre has an excellent strength to weight ratio, is stiff, and gives excellent kinetic energy transfer. Before the adoption of carbon fibre composite, racquets were made of light metals such as aluminium. Earlier still, racquets were made of wood. Cheap racquets are still often made of metals such as steel, but wooden racquets are no longer manufactured for the ordinary market, because of their excessive mass and cost. Nowadays, nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes and fullerenes are added to racquets giving them greater durability.

There is a wide variety of racquet designs, although the laws limit the racquet size and shape. Different racquets have playing characteristics that appeal to different players. The traditional oval head shape is still available, but an head shape is increasingly common in new racquets.

===Strings===

Badminton strings for racquets are thin, high-performing strings with thicknesses ranging from about 0.62 to 0.73 mm. Thicker strings are more durable, but many players prefer the feel of thinner strings. String tension is normally in the range of 80 to 160 N (18 to 36 lbf). Recreational players generally string at lower tensions than professionals, typically between 80 and 110 N (18 and 25 lbf). Professionals string between about 110 and 160 N (25 and 36 lbf). Some string manufacturers measure the thickness of their strings under tension so they are actually thicker than specified when slack. Ashaway Micropower is actually 0.7mm but Yonex BG-66 is about 0.72mm.

It is often argued that high string tensions improve control, whereas low string tensions increase power. The arguments for this generally rely on crude mechanical reasoning, such as claiming that a lower tension string bed is more bouncy and therefore provides more power. This is, in fact, incorrect, for a higher string tension can cause the shuttle to slide off the racquet and hence make it harder to hit a shot accurately. An alternative view suggests that the optimum tension for power depends on the player: the faster and more accurately a player can swing their racquet, the higher the tension for maximum power. Neither view has been subjected to a rigorous mechanical analysis, nor is there clear evidence in favour of one or the other. The most effective way for a player to find a good string tension is to experiment.

===Grip===
The choice of grip allows a player to increase the thickness of their racquet handle and choose a comfortable surface to hold. A player may build up the handle with one or several grips before applying the final layer.

Players may choose between a variety of grip materials. The most common choices are PU synthetic grips or towelling grips. Grip choice is a matter of personal preference. Players often find that sweat becomes a problem; in this case, a drying agent may be applied to the grip or hands, sweatbands may be used, the player may choose another grip material or change their grip more frequently.

There are two main types of grip: &quot;replacement&quot; grips and &quot;overgrips&quot;. Replacement grips are thicker and are often used to increase the size of the handle. Overgrips are thinner (less than 1 mm), and are often used as the final layer. Many players, however, prefer to use replacement grips as the final layer. Towelling grips are always replacement grips. Replacement grips have an adhesive backing, whereas overgrips have only a small patch of adhesive at the start of the tape and must be applied under tension; overgrips are more convenient for players who change grips frequently, because they may be removed more rapidly without damaging the underlying material.

===Shuttlecock===

A shuttlecock (often abbreviated to &quot;shuttle&quot;; also called a &quot;birdie&quot;) is a high-drag projectile, with an open conical shape: the cone is formed from sixteen overlapping feathers embedded into a rounded cork base. The cork is covered with thin leather or synthetic material. Synthetic shuttles are often used by recreational players to reduce their costs as feathered shuttles break easily. These nylon shuttles may be constructed with either natural cork or synthetic foam base and a plastic skirt.

Badminton rules also provide for testing a shuttlecock for the correct speed:

===Shoes===
Badminton shoes are lightweight with soles of rubber or similar high-grip, non-marking materials, similar to tennis shoes.

Compared to running shoes, badminton shoes have little lateral support. High levels of lateral support are useful for activities where lateral motion is undesirable and unexpected. Badminton, however, requires powerful lateral movements. A highly built-up lateral support will not be able to protect the foot in badminton; instead, it will encourage catastrophic collapse at the point where the shoe&#x27;s support fails, and the player&#x27;s ankles are not ready for the sudden loading, which can cause sprains. For this reason, players should choose badminton shoes rather than general trainers or running shoes, because proper badminton shoes will have a very thin sole, lower a person&#x27;s centre of gravity, and therefore result in fewer injuries.

===Outfits===
The Badminton World Federation and Octagon developed a rule that female badminton players must wear dresses or skirts &quot;to ensure attractive presentation&quot;, but although it was included in the official rulebook in 2011, it was dropped before it was supposed to go into effect in 2012.

==Technique==


===Strokes===

Badminton offers a wide variety of basic strokes, and players require a high level of skill to perform all of them effectively. All strokes can be played either &quot;forehand&quot; or &quot;backhand&quot;. A player&#x27;s forehand side is the same side as their playing hand: for a right-handed player, the forehand side is their right side and the backhand side is their left side. Forehand strokes are hit with the front of the hand leading (like hitting with the palm), whereas backhand strokes are hit with the back of the hand leading (like hitting with the knuckles). Players frequently play certain strokes on the forehand side with a backhand hitting action, and vice versa.

In the forecourt and midcourt, most strokes can be played equally effectively on either the forehand or backhand side; but in the rear court, players will attempt to play as many strokes as possible on their forehands, often preferring to play a &quot;round-the-head&quot; forehand overhead (a forehand &quot;on the backhand side&quot;) rather than attempt a backhand overhead. Playing a backhand overhead has two main disadvantages. First, the player must turn their back to their opponents, restricting their view of them and the court. Second, backhand overheads cannot be hit with as much power as forehands: the hitting action is limited by the shoulder joint, which permits a much greater range of movement for a forehand overhead than for a backhand. The &quot;backhand clear&quot; is considered by most players and coaches to be the most difficult basic stroke in the game, since the precise technique is needed in order to muster enough power for the shuttlecock to travel the full length of the court. For the same reason, &quot;backhand smashes&quot; tend to be weak.

===Position of the shuttlecock and receiving player===

The choice of stroke depends on how near the shuttlecock is to the net, whether it is above net height, and where an opponent is currently positioned: players have much better attacking options if they can reach the shuttlecock well above net height, especially if it is also close to the net. In the forecourt, a high shuttlecock will be met with a &quot;net kill&quot;, hitting it steeply downwards and attempting to win the rally immediately. This is why it is best to drop the shuttlecock just over the net in this situation. In the midcourt, a high shuttlecock will usually be met with a powerful &quot;smash&quot;, also hitting downwards and hoping for an outright winner or a weak reply. Athletic &quot;jump smashes&quot;, where players jump upwards for a steeper smash angle, are a common and spectacular element of elite men&#x27;s doubles play. In the rearcourt, players strive to hit the shuttlecock while it is still above them, rather than allowing it to drop lower. This &quot;overhead&quot; hitting allows them to play smashes, &quot;clears&quot; (hitting the shuttlecock high and to the back of the opponents&#x27; court), and &quot;drop shots&quot; (hitting the shuttlecock softly so that it falls sharply downwards into the opponents&#x27; forecourt). If the shuttlecock has dropped lower, then a smash is impossible and a full-length, high clear is difficult.

===Vertical position of the shuttlecock===

When the shuttlecock is well below net height, players have no choice but to hit upwards. &quot;Lifts&quot;, where the shuttlecock is hit upwards to the back of the opponents&#x27; court, can be played from all parts of the court. If a player does not lift, their only remaining option is to push the shuttlecock softly back to the net: in the forecourt, this is called a &quot;net shot&quot;; in the midcourt or rear court, it is often called a &quot;push&quot; or &quot;block&quot;.

When the shuttlecock is near to net height, players can hit &quot;drives&quot;, which travel flat and rapidly over the net into the opponents&#x27; rear midcourt and rear court. Pushes may also be hit flatter, placing the shuttlecock into the front midcourt. Drives and pushes may be played from the midcourt or forecourt, and are most often used in doubles: they are an attempt to regain the attack, rather than choosing to lift the shuttlecock and defend against smashes. After a successful drive or push, the opponents will often be forced to lift the shuttlecock.

===Spin===

Balls may be spun to alter their bounce (for example, topspin and backspin in tennis) or trajectory, and players may slice the ball (strike it with an angled racquet face) to produce such spin. The shuttlecock is not allowed to bounce, but slicing the shuttlecock does have applications in badminton. (See Basic strokes for an explanation of technical terms.)
* Slicing the shuttlecock from the side may cause it to travel in a different direction from the direction suggested by the player&#x27;s racquet or body movement. This is used to deceive opponents.
* Slicing the shuttlecock from the side may cause it to follow a slightly curved path (as seen from above), and the deceleration imparted by the spin causes sliced strokes to slow down more suddenly towards the end of their flight path. This can be used to create drop shots and smashes that dip more steeply after they pass the net.
* When playing a net shot, slicing underneath the shuttlecock may cause it to turn over itself (tumble) several times as it passes the net. This is called a &quot;spinning net shot&quot; or &quot;tumbling net shot&quot;. The opponent will be unwilling to address the shuttlecock until it has corrected its orientation.

Due to the way that its feathers overlap, a shuttlecock also has a slight natural spin about its axis of rotational symmetry. The spin is in a counter-clockwise direction as seen from above when dropping a shuttlecock. This natural spin affects certain strokes: a tumbling net shot is more effective if the slicing action is from right to left, rather than from left to right.

===Biomechanics===

Badminton biomechanics have not been the subject of extensive scientific study, but some studies confirm the minor role of the wrist in power generation and indicate that the major contributions to power come from internal and external rotations of the upper and lower arm. Recent guides to the sport thus emphasize forearm rotation rather than wrist movements.

The feathers impart substantial drag, causing the shuttlecock to decelerate greatly over distance. The shuttlecock is also extremely aerodynamically stable: regardless of initial orientation, it will turn to fly cork-first and remain in the cork-first orientation.

One consequence of the shuttlecock&#x27;s drag is that it requires considerable power to hit it the full length of the court, which is not the case for most racquet sports. The drag also influences the flight path of a lifted (&quot;lobbed&quot;) shuttlecock: the parabola of its flight is heavily skewed so that it falls at a steeper angle than it rises. With very high serves, the shuttlecock may even fall vertically.

===Other factors===

When defending against a smash, players have three basic options: lift, block, or drive. In singles, a block to the net is the most common reply. In doubles, a lift is the safest option but it usually allows the opponents to continue smashing; blocks and drives are counter-attacking strokes but may be intercepted by the smasher&#x27;s partner. Many players use a backhand hitting action for returning smashes on both the forehand and backhand sides because backhands are more effective than forehands at covering smashes directed to the body. Hard shots directed towards the body are difficult to defend.

The service is restricted by the Laws and presents its own array of stroke choices. Unlike in tennis, the server&#x27;s racquet must be pointing in a downward direction to deliver the serve so normally the shuttle must be hit upwards to pass over the net. The server can choose a &quot;low serve&quot; into the forecourt (like a push), or a lift to the back of the service court, or a flat &quot;drive serve&quot;. Lifted serves may be either &quot;high serves&quot;, where the shuttlecock is lifted so high that it falls almost vertically at the back of the court, or &quot;flick serves&quot;, where the shuttlecock is lifted to a lesser height but falls sooner.

===Deception===

Once players have mastered these basic strokes, they can hit the shuttlecock from and to any part of the court, powerfully and softly as required. Beyond the basics, however, badminton offers rich potential for advanced stroke skills that provide a competitive advantage. Because badminton players have to cover a short distance as quickly as possible, the purpose of many advanced strokes is to deceive the opponent, so that either they are tricked into believing that a different stroke is being played, or they are forced to delay their movement until they actually sees the shuttle&#x27;s direction. &quot;Deception&quot; in badminton is often used in both of these senses. When a player is genuinely deceived, they will often lose the point immediately because they cannot change their direction quickly enough to reach the shuttlecock. Experienced players will be aware of the trick and cautious not to move too early, but the attempted deception is still useful because it forces the opponent to delay their movement slightly. Against weaker players whose intended strokes are obvious, an experienced player may move before the shuttlecock has been hit, anticipating the stroke to gain an advantage.

&quot;Slicing&quot; and using a &quot;shortened hitting action&quot; are the two main technical devices that facilitate deception. Slicing involves hitting the shuttlecock with an angled racquet face, causing it to travel in a different direction than suggested by the body or arm movement. Slicing also causes the shuttlecock to travel more slowly than the arm movement suggests. For example, a good crosscourt &quot;sliced drop shot&quot; will use a hitting action that suggests a straight clear or a smash, deceiving the opponent about both the power and direction of the shuttlecock. A more sophisticated slicing action involves brushing the strings around the shuttlecock during the hit, in order to make the shuttlecock spin. This can be used to improve the shuttle&#x27;s trajectory, by making it dip more rapidly as it passes the net; for example, a sliced low serve can travel slightly faster than a normal low serve, yet land on the same spot. Spinning the shuttlecock is also used to create &quot;spinning net shots&quot; (also called &quot;tumbling net shots&quot;), in which the shuttlecock turns over itself several times (tumbles) before stabilizing; sometimes the shuttlecock remains inverted instead of tumbling. The main advantage of a spinning net shot is that the opponent will be unwilling to address the shuttlecock until it has stopped tumbling, since hitting the feathers will result in an unpredictable stroke. Spinning net shots are especially important for high-level singles players.

The lightness of modern racquets allows players to use a very short hitting action for many strokes, thereby maintaining the option to hit a powerful or a soft stroke until the last possible moment. For example, a singles player may hold their racquet ready for a net shot, but then flick the shuttlecock to the back instead with a shallow lift when they notice the opponent has moved before the actual shot was played. A shallow lift takes less time to reach the ground and as mentioned above a rally is over when the shuttlecock touches the ground. This makes the opponent&#x27;s task of covering the whole court much more difficult than if the lift was hit higher and with a bigger, obvious swing. A short hitting action is not only useful for deception: it also allows the player to hit powerful strokes when they have no time for a big arm swing. A big arm swing is also usually not advised in badminton because bigger swings make it more difficult to recover for the next shot in fast exchanges. The use of grip tightening is crucial to these techniques, and is often described as &quot;finger power&quot;. Elite players develop finger power to the extent that they can hit some power strokes, such as net kills, with less than a racquet swing.

It is also possible to reverse this style of deception, by suggesting a powerful stroke before slowing down the hitting action to play a soft stroke. In general, this latter style of deception is more common in the rear court (for example, drop shots disguised as smashes), whereas the former style is more common in the forecourt and midcourt (for example, lifts disguised as net shots).

Deception is not limited to slicing and short hitting actions. Players may also use &quot;double motion&quot;, where they make an initial racquet movement in one direction before withdrawing the racquet to hit in another direction. Players will often do this to send opponents in the wrong direction. The racquet movement is typically used to suggest a straight angle but then play the stroke crosscourt, or vice versa. &quot;Triple motion&quot; is also possible, but this is very rare in actual play. An alternative to double motion is to use a &quot;racquet head fake&quot;, where the initial motion is continued but the racquet is turned during the hit. This produces a smaller change in direction but does not require as much time.

==Injuries==
In badminton, cramps, usually in the arms and legs, are very common. Elbow, and leg pain is also common due to fast movement. A notable incident in badminton is the death of Zhang Zhijie, who collapsed onto the court, and died of cardiac arrest.

Another notable incident is the major knee injury of Carolina Marin, in which she had landed on her already surgically repaired knee akwardly, breaking her right knee. She was leading 21-14, and in the second game, was forced to retire, 10-6.

==Strategy==
To win in badminton, players need to employ a wide variety of strokes in the right situations. These range from powerful jumping smashes to delicate tumbling net returns. Often rallies finish with a smash, but setting up the smash requires subtler strokes. For example, a net shot can force the opponent to lift the shuttlecock, which gives an opportunity to smash. If the net shot is tight and tumbling, then the opponent&#x27;s lift will not reach the back of the court, which makes the subsequent smash much harder to return.

Deception is also important, helping players gain time back, and tricking the opponent (if played properly). Expert players prepare for many different strokes that look identical and use slicing to deceive their opponents about the speed or direction of the stroke. If an opponent tries to anticipate the stroke, they may move in the wrong direction and may be unable to change their body momentum in time to reach the shuttlecock.

===Singles===

Since one person needs to cover the entire court, singles tactics are based on forcing the opponent to move as much as possible; this means that singles strokes are normally directed to the corners of the court. Players exploit the length of the court by combining lifts and clears with drop shots and net shots. Smashing tends to be less prominent in singles than in doubles because the smasher has no partner to follow up their effort and is thus vulnerable to a skillfully placed return. Moreover, frequent smashing can be exhausting in singles where the conservation of a player&#x27;s energy is at a premium. However, players with strong smashes will sometimes use the shot to create openings, and players commonly smash weak returns to try to end rallies.

In singles, players will often start the rally with a forehand high serve or with a flick serve. Low serves are also used frequently, either forehand or backhand. Drive serves are rare.

At high levels of play, singles demand extraordinary fitness. Singles is a game of patient positional manoeuvring, unlike the all-out aggression of doubles.

===Doubles===
Both pairs will try to gain and maintain the attack, smashing downwards when the opportunity arises. Whenever possible, a pair will adopt an ideal attacking formation with one player hitting down from the rear court, and their partner in the midcourt intercepting all smash returns except the lift. If the rear court attacker plays a drop shot, their partner will move into the forecourt to threaten the net reply. If a pair cannot hit downwards, they will use flat strokes in an attempt to gain the attack. If a pair is forced to lift or clear the shuttlecock, then they must defend: they will adopt a side-by-side position in the rear midcourt, to cover the full width of their court against the opponents&#x27; smashes. In doubles, players generally smash to the middle ground between two players in order to take advantage of confusion and clashes.

At high levels of play, the backhand serve has become popular to the extent that forehand serves have become fairly rare at a high level of play. The straight low serve is used most frequently, in an attempt to prevent the opponents gaining the attack immediately. Flick serves are used to prevent the opponent from anticipating the low serve and attacking it decisively.

At high levels of play, doubles rallies are extremely fast. Men&#x27;s doubles are the most aggressive form of badminton, with a high proportion of powerful jump smashes and very quick reflex exchanges. Because of this, spectator interest is sometimes greater for men&#x27;s doubles than for singles.

===Mixed doubles===

In mixed doubles, both pairs typically try to maintain an attacking formation with the woman at the front and the man at the back. This is because the male players are usually substantially stronger, and can, therefore, produce smashes that are more powerful. As a result, mixed doubles require greater tactical awareness and subtler positional play. Clever opponents will try to reverse the ideal position, by forcing the woman towards the back or the man towards the front. In order to protect against this danger, mixed players must be careful and systematic in their shot selection.

At high levels of play, the formations will generally be more flexible: the top women players are capable of playing powerfully from the back-court, and will happily do so if required. When the opportunity arises, however, the pair will switch back to the standard mixed attacking position, with the woman in front and men in the back.

==Organization==

===Governing bodies===
The Badminton World Federation (BWF) is the internationally recognized governing body of the sport responsible for the regulation of tournaments and approaching fair play. Five regional confederations are associated with the BWF, the rest are unaffiliated, or are minor in comparison.

* Asia: Badminton Asia Confederation (BAC)
* Africa: Badminton Confederation of Africa (BCA)
* Americas: Badminton Pan Am (North America and South America belong to the same confederation; BPA)
* Europe: Badminton Europe (BE)
* Oceania: Badminton Oceania (BO)
Unaffiliated:
* Canada: Badminton Canada
* America: USA Badminton
* Philippines: Philippine Badminton Association
* Japan: Nippon Badminton Association
* North Macedonia: North Macedonian Badminton Federation
* Spain: Spanish Badminton Federation
* North Korea (DPRK): Badminton Association of the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea
* South Korea: Badminton Korea Association
* Portugal: Federação Portuguesa de Badminton

===Competitions===

The BWF organizes several international competitions, including the Thomas Cup, the premier men&#x27;s international team event first held in 1948–1949, and the Uber Cup, the women&#x27;s equivalent first held in 1956–1957. The competitions now take place once every two years. More than 50 national teams compete in qualifying tournaments within continental confederations for a place in the finals. The final tournament involves 12 teams, following an increase from eight teams in 2004. It was further increased to 16 teams in 2012.

The Sudirman Cup, a gender-mixed international team event held once every two years, began in 1989. Teams are divided into seven levels based on the performance of each country. To win the tournament, a country must perform well across all five disciplines (men&#x27;s doubles and singles, women&#x27;s doubles and singles, and mixed doubles). Like association football (soccer), it features a promotion and relegation system at every level. However, the system was last used in 2009 and teams competing will now be grouped by world rankings.

Badminton was a demonstration event at the 1972 and 1988 Summer Olympics. It became an official Summer Olympic sport at the Barcelona Olympics in 1992 and its gold medals now generally rate as the sport&#x27;s most coveted prizes for individual players.

In the BWF World Championships, first held in 1977, currently only the highest-ranked 64 players in the world, and a maximum of four from each country can participate in any category. Therefore, it&#x27;s not an &quot;open&quot; format. In both the BWF World and the Olympic competitions restrictions on the number of participants from any one country have caused some controversy, because they result in excluding some world elite level players from the strongest badminton nations. The Thomas, Uber, and Sudirman Cups, the Olympics, and the BWF World (and World Junior Championships), are all categorized as level one tournaments.

At the start of 2007, the BWF introduced a new tournament structure for the highest level tournaments aside from those in level one: the BWF Super Series. This &quot;level two&quot; tournament series is a circuit for the world&#x27;s elite players, staging twelve open tournaments around the world with 32 players (half the previous limit). The players collect points that determine whether they can play in Super Series Finals held at the year-end. Among the tournaments in this series is the venerable All-England Championships, first held in 1900, which was once considered the unofficial world championships of the sport.

Level three tournaments consist of Grand Prix Gold and Grand Prix event. Top players can collect the world ranking points and enable them to play in the BWF Super Series open tournaments. These include the regional competitions in Asia (Badminton Asia Championships) and Europe (European Badminton Championships), which produce the world&#x27;s best players as well as the Pan America Badminton Championships.

The level four tournaments, known as International Challenge, International Series, and Future Series, encourage participation by junior players.

==Comparison with tennis==
Badminton is frequently compared to tennis due to several qualities. The following is a list of manifest differences:
* Scoring: In badminton, a match is played best of 2 of 3 games, with each game played up to 21 points. In tennis a match is played best of 3 or 5 sets, each set consisting of 6 games and each game ends when one player wins 4 points or wins two consecutive points at deuce points. If both teams are tied at &quot;game point&quot;, they must play until one team achieves a two-point advantage. However, at 29all, whoever scores the golden point will win. In tennis, if the score is tied 66 in a set, a tiebreaker will be played, which ends once a player reaches at least 7 points and has a two-point advantage.
* In tennis, the ball may bounce once before the point ends; in badminton, the rally ends once the shuttlecock touches the floor.
* In tennis, the serve is dominant to the extent that the server is expected to win most of their service games (at advanced level &amp; onwards); a &quot;break&quot; of service, where the server loses the game, is of major importance in a match. In badminton, a server has far less an advantage and is unlikely to score an &quot;ace&quot; (unreturnable serve).
* In tennis, the server has two chances to hit a serve into the service box; in badminton, the server is allowed only one attempt.
* A tennis court is approximately twice the length and width of a badminton court.
* Tennis racquets are about four times as heavy as badminton racquets, versus . Tennis balls are more than eleven times heavier than shuttlecocks, versus .
* The fastest recorded tennis stroke is Samuel Groth&#x27;s serve, whereas the fastest badminton stroke during gameplay was Mads Pieler Kolding&#x27;s recorded smash at a Badminton Premier League match.

Statistics such as the smash speed, above, prompt badminton enthusiasts to make other comparisons that are more contentious. For example, it is often claimed that badminton is the fastest racquet sport. Although badminton holds the record for the fastest initial speed of a racquet sports projectile, the shuttlecock decelerates substantially faster than other projectiles such as tennis balls. In turn, this qualification must be qualified by consideration of the distance over which the shuttlecock travels: a smashed shuttlecock travels a shorter distance than a tennis ball during a serve.

While fans of badminton and tennis often claim that their sport is the more physically demanding, such comparisons are difficult to make objectively because of the differing demands of the games. No formal study currently exists evaluating the physical condition of the players or demands during gameplay.

Badminton and tennis techniques differ substantially. The lightness of the shuttlecock and of badminton racquets allows badminton players to make use of the wrist and fingers much more than tennis players; in tennis, the wrist is normally held stable, and playing with a mobile wrist may lead to injury. For the same reasons, badminton players can generate power from a short racquet swing: for some strokes such as net kills, an elite player&#x27;s swing may be less than . For strokes that require more power, a longer swing will typically be used, but the badminton racquet swing will rarely be as long as a typical tennis swing.

<text>The Baroque ( , ; ) is a Western style of architecture, music, dance, painting, sculpture, poetry, and other arts that flourished from the early 17th century until the 1750s. It followed Renaissance art and Mannerism and preceded the Rococo (in the past often referred to as &quot;late Baroque&quot;) and Neoclassical styles. It was encouraged by the Catholic Church as a means to counter the simplicity and austerity of Protestant architecture, art, and music, though Lutheran Baroque art developed in parts of Europe as well.

The Baroque style used contrast, movement, exuberant detail, deep color, grandeur, and surprise to achieve a sense of awe. The style began at the start of the 17th century in Rome, then spread rapidly to the rest of Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal, then to Austria, southern Germany, and Poland. By the 1730s, it had evolved into an even more flamboyant style, called &quot;rocaille&quot; or &quot;Rococo&quot;, which appeared in France and Central Europe until the mid to late 18th century. In the territories of the Spanish and Portuguese Empires including the Iberian Peninsula it continued, together with new styles, until the first decade of the 19th century.

In the decorative arts, the style employs plentiful and intricate ornamentation. The departure from Renaissance classicism has its own ways in each country. But a general feature is that everywhere the starting point is the ornamental elements introduced by the Renaissance. The classical repertoire is crowded, dense, overlapping, loaded, in order to provoke shock effects. New motifs introduced by Baroque are: the cartouche, trophies and weapons, baskets of fruit or flowers, and others, made in marquetry, stucco, or carved.

==Origin of the word==
The English word &quot;baroque&quot; comes directly from the French. Some scholars state that the French word originated from the Portuguese term &#x27;a flawed pearl&#x27;, pointing to the Latin &#x27;wart&#x27;, or to a word with the Romance suffix (common in pre-Roman Iberia). Other sources suggest a Medieval Latin term used in logic, , as the most likely source.

In the 16th century the Medieval Latin word moved beyond scholastic logic and came into use to characterise anything that seemed absurdly complex. The French philosopher (1533–1592) helped to give the term (spelled by him) the meaning &#x27;bizarre, uselessly complicated&#x27;. Other early sources associate with magic, complexity, confusion, and excess.

The word &quot;baroque&quot; was also associated with irregular pearls before the 18th century. The French and Portuguese were terms often associated with jewelry. An example from 1531 uses the term to describe pearls in an inventory of Charles V of France&#x27;s treasures. Later, the word appears in a 1694 edition of , which describes &quot;baroque&quot; as &quot;only used for pearls that are imperfectly round.&quot; A 1728 Portuguese dictionary similarly describes as relating to a &quot;coarse and uneven pearl&quot;.

An alternative derivation of the word &quot;baroque&quot; points to the name of the Italian painter Federico Barocci (1528–1612).

In the 18th century the term began to be used to describe music, and not in a flattering way. In an anonymous satirical review of the première of &#x27;s in October 1733, which was printed in the in May 1734, the critic wrote that the novelty in this opera was &quot;&quot;, complaining that the music lacked coherent melody, was unsparing with dissonances, constantly changed key and meter, and speedily ran through every compositional device.

In 1762 recorded that the term could figuratively describe something &quot;irregular, bizarre or unequal&quot;.

Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who was a musician and composer as well as a philosopher, wrote in the in 1768: &quot;Baroque music is that in which the harmony is confused, and loaded with modulations and dissonances. The singing is harsh and unnatural, the intonation difficult, and the movement limited. It appears that term comes from the word &#x27;baroco&#x27; used by logicians.&quot;

In 1788 defined the term in the as &quot;an architectural style that is highly adorned and tormented&quot;.

The French terms and appeared in in 1835. By the mid-19th century, art critics and historians had adopted the term &quot;baroque&quot; as a way to ridicule post-Renaissance art. This was the sense of the word as used in 1855 by the leading art historian Jacob Burckhardt, who wrote that baroque artists &quot;despised and abused detail&quot; because they lacked &quot;respect for tradition&quot;.

In 1888 the art historian Heinrich Wölfflin published the first serious academic work on the style, &quot;Renaissance und Barock&quot;, which described the differences between the painting, sculpture, and architecture of the Renaissance and the Baroque.

==Architecture: origins and characteristics==
The Baroque style of architecture was a result of doctrines adopted by the Catholic Church at the Council of Trent in 1545–1563, in response to the Protestant Reformation. The first phase of the Counter-Reformation had imposed a severe, academic style on religious architecture, which had appealed to intellectuals but not the mass of churchgoers. The Council of Trent decided instead to appeal to a more popular audience, and declared that the arts should communicate religious themes with direct and emotional involvement. Similarly, Lutheran Baroque art developed as a confessional marker of identity, in response to the Great Iconoclasm of Calvinists.

Baroque churches were designed with a large central space, where the worshippers could be close to the altar, with a dome or cupola high overhead, allowing light to illuminate the church below. The dome was one of the central symbolic features of Baroque architecture illustrating the union between the heavens and the earth. The inside of the cupola was lavishly decorated with paintings of angels and saints, and with stucco statuettes of angels, giving the impression to those below of looking up at heaven. Another feature of Baroque churches are the &quot;quadratura&quot;; trompe-l&#x27;œil paintings on the ceiling in stucco frames, either real or painted, crowded with paintings of saints and angels and connected by architectural details with the balustrades and consoles. &quot;Quadratura&quot; paintings of Atlantes below the cornices appear to be supporting the ceiling of the church. Unlike the painted ceilings of Michelangelo in the Sistine Chapel, which combined different scenes, each with its own perspective, to be looked at one at a time, the Baroque ceiling paintings were carefully created so the viewer on the floor of the church would see the entire ceiling in correct perspective, as if the figures were real.

The interiors of Baroque churches became more and more ornate in the High Baroque, and focused around the altar, usually placed under the dome. The most celebrated baroque decorative works of the High Baroque are the Chair of Saint Peter (1647–1653) and St. Peter&#x27;s Baldachin (1623–1634), both by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome. The Baldequin of St. Peter is an example of the balance of opposites in Baroque art; the gigantic proportions of the piece, with the apparent lightness of the canopy; and the contrast between the solid twisted columns, bronze, gold and marble of the piece with the flowing draperies of the angels on the canopy. The Dresden Frauenkirche serves as a prominent example of Lutheran Baroque art, which was completed in 1743 after being commissioned by the Lutheran city council of Dresden and was &quot;compared by eighteenth-century observers to St Peter&#x27;s in Rome&quot;.

The twisted column in the interior of churches is one of the signature features of the Baroque. It gives both a sense of motion and also a dramatic new way of reflecting light.

The cartouche was another characteristic feature of Baroque decoration. These were large plaques carved of marble or stone, usually oval and with a rounded surface, which carried images or text in gilded letters, and were placed as interior decoration or above the doorways of buildings, delivering messages to those below. They showed a wide variety of invention, and were found in all types of buildings, from cathedrals and palaces to small chapels.

Baroque architects sometimes used forced perspective to create illusions. For the Palazzo Spada in Rome, Francesco Borromini used columns of diminishing size, a narrowing floor and a miniature statue in the garden beyond to create the illusion that a passageway was thirty meters long, when it was actually only seven meters long. A statue at the end of the passage appears to be life-size, though it is only sixty centimeters high. Borromini designed the illusion with the assistance of a mathematician.

===Italian Baroque===
The first building in Rome to have a Baroque façade was the Church of the Gesù in 1584; it was plain by later Baroque standards, but marked a break with the traditional Renaissance façades that preceded it. The interior of this church remained very austere until the high Baroque, when it was lavishly ornamented.

In Rome in 1605, Paul V became the first of series of popes who commissioned basilicas and church buildings designed to inspire emotion and awe through a proliferation of forms, and a richness of colours and dramatic effects. Among the most influential monuments of the Early Baroque were the façade of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica (1606–1619), and the new nave and loggia which connected the façade to Michelangelo&#x27;s dome in the earlier church. The new design created a dramatic contrast between the soaring dome and the disproportionately wide façade, and the contrast on the façade itself between the Doric columns and the great mass of the portico.

In the mid to late 17th century the style reached its peak, later termed the High Baroque. Many monumental works were commissioned by Popes Urban VIII and Alexander VII. The sculptor and architect Gian Lorenzo Bernini designed a new quadruple colonnade around St. Peter&#x27;s Square (1656 to 1667). The three galleries of columns in a giant ellipse balance the oversize dome and give the Church and square a unity and the feeling of a giant theatre.

Another major innovator of the Italian High Baroque was Francesco Borromini, whose major work was the Church of San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane or Saint Charles of the Four Fountains (1634–1646). The sense of movement is given not by the decoration, but by the walls themselves, which undulate and by concave and convex elements, including an oval tower and balcony inserted into a concave traverse. The interior was equally revolutionary; the main space of the church was oval, beneath an oval dome.

Painted ceilings, crowded with angels and saints and trompe-l&#x27;œil architectural effects, were an important feature of the Italian High Baroque. Major works included &quot;The Entry of Saint Ignatius into Paradise&quot; by Andrea Pozzo (1685–1695) in the Sant&#x27;Ignazio Church, Rome, and &quot;The Triumph of the Name of Jesus&quot; by Giovanni Battista Gaulli in the Church of the Gesù in Rome (1669–1683), which featured figures spilling out of the picture frame and dramatic oblique lighting and light-dark contrasts.

The style spread quickly from Rome to other regions of Italy: It appeared in Venice in the church of Santa Maria della Salute (1631–1687) by Baldassare Longhena, a highly original octagonal form crowned with an enormous cupola. It appeared also in Turin, notably in the Chapel of the Holy Shroud (1668–1694) by Guarino Guarini. The style also began to be used in palaces; Guarini designed the Palazzo Carignano in Turin, while Longhena designed the Ca&#x27; Rezzonico on the Grand Canal, (1657), finished by Giorgio Massari with decorated with paintings by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. A series of massive earthquakes in Sicily required the rebuilding of most of them and several were built in the exuberant late Baroque or Rococo style.

===Spanish Baroque===

The Catholic Church in Spain, and particularly the Jesuits, were the driving force of Spanish Baroque architecture. The first major work in this style was the San Isidro Chapel in Madrid, begun in 1643 by Pedro de la Torre. It contrasted an extreme richness of ornament on the exterior with simplicity in the interior, divided into multiple spaces and using effects of light to create a sense of mystery. The Santiago de Compostela Cathedral was modernized with a series of Baroque additions beginning at the end of the 17th century, starting with a highly ornate bell tower (1680), then flanked by two even taller and more ornate towers, called the &quot;Obradorio&quot;, added between 1738 and 1750 by Fernando de Casas Novoa. Another landmark of the Spanish Baroque is the chapel tower of the Palace of San Telmo in Seville by Leonardo de Figueroa.

Granada had only been conquered from the Moors in the 15th century, and had its own distinct variety of Baroque. The painter, sculptor and architect Alonso Cano designed the Baroque interior of Granada Cathedral between 1652 and his death in 1657. It features dramatic contrasts of the massive white columns and gold decor.

The most ornamental and lavishly decorated architecture of the Spanish Baroque is called Churrigueresque style, named after the brothers Churriguera, who worked primarily in Salamanca and Madrid. Their works include the buildings on Salamanca&#x27;s main square, the Plaza Mayor (1729). This highly ornamental Baroque style was influential in many churches and cathedrals built by the Spanish in the Americas.

Other notable Spanish baroque architects of the late Baroque include Pedro de Ribera, a pupil of Churriguera, who designed the Real Hospicio de San Fernando in Madrid, and Narciso Tomé, who designed the celebrated El Transparente altarpiece at Toledo Cathedral (1729–1732) which gives the illusion, in certain light, of floating upwards.

The architects of the Spanish Baroque had an effect far beyond Spain; their work was highly influential in the churches built in the Spanish colonies in Latin America and the Philippines. The church built by the Jesuits for the College of San Francisco Javier in Tepotzotlán, with its ornate Baroque façade and tower, is a good example.

===Central Europe===

From 1680 to 1750, many highly ornate cathedrals, abbeys, and pilgrimage churches were built in Central Europe, Austria, Bohemia and southwestern Poland. Some were in Rococo style, a distinct, more flamboyant and asymmetric style which emerged from the Baroque, then replaced it in Central Europe in the first half of the 18th century, until it was replaced in turn by classicism.

The princes of the multitude of states in that region also chose Baroque or Rococo for their palaces and residences, and often used Italian-trained architects to construct them.

A notable example is the St. Nicholas Church (Malá Strana) in Prague (1704–1755), built by Christoph Dientzenhofer and his son Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhofer. Decoration covers all of walls of interior of the church. The altar is placed in the nave beneath the central dome, and surrounded by chapels, light comes down from the dome above and from the surrounding chapels. The altar is entirely surrounded by arches, columns, curved balustrades and pilasters of coloured stone, which are richly decorated with statuary, creating a deliberate confusion between the real architecture and the decoration. The architecture is transformed into a theatre of light, colour and movement.

In Poland, the Italian-inspired Polish Baroque lasted from the early 17th to the mid-18th century and emphasised richness of detail and colour. The first Baroque building in present-day Poland and probably one of the most recognizable is the Saints Peter and Paul Church, Kraków, designed by Giovanni Battista Trevano. Sigismund&#x27;s Column in Warsaw, erected in 1644, was the world&#x27;s first secular Baroque monument built in the form of a column. The palatial residence style was exemplified by the Wilanów Palace, constructed between 1677 and 1696. The most renowned Baroque architect active in Poland was Dutchman Tylman van Gameren and his notable works include Warsaw&#x27;s St. Kazimierz Church and Krasiński Palace, Church of St. Anne, Kraków and Branicki Palace, Białystok. However, the most celebrated work of Polish Baroque is the Poznań Fara Church, with details by Pompeo Ferrari. After Thirty Years&#x27; War under the agreements of the Peace of Westphalia two unique baroque wattle and daub structures was built: Church of Peace in Jawor, Holy Trinity Church of Peace in Świdnica the largest wooden Baroque temple in Europe.

===German Baroque===
The many states within the Holy Roman Empire on the territory of today&#x27;s Germany all looked to represent themselves with impressive Baroque buildings. Notable architects included Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach, Lukas von Hildebrandt and Dominikus Zimmermann in Bavaria, Balthasar Neumann in Bruhl, and Matthäus Daniel Pöppelmann in Dresden. In Prussia, Frederick II of Prussia was inspired by the Grand Trianon of the Palace of Versailles, and used it as the model for his summer residence, Sanssouci, in Potsdam, designed for him by Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff (1745–1747). Another work of Baroque palace architecture is the Zwinger (Dresden), the former orangerie of the palace of the electors of Saxony in the 18th century.

One of the best examples of a rococo church is the Basilika Vierzehnheiligen, or Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers, a pilgrimage church located near the town of Bad Staffelstein near Bamberg, in Bavaria, southern Germany. The Basilica was designed by Balthasar Neumann and was constructed between 1743 and 1772, its plan a series of interlocking circles around a central oval with the altar placed in the exact centre of the church. The interior of this church illustrates the summit of Rococo decoration.
Another notable example of the style is the Pilgrimage Church of Wies (). It was designed by the brothers J. B. and Dominikus Zimmermann. It is located in the foothills of the Alps, in the municipality of Steingaden in the Weilheim-Schongau district, Bavaria, Germany. Construction took place between 1745 and 1754, and the interior was decorated with frescoes and with stuccowork in the tradition of the Wessobrunner School. It is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

===French Baroque===

Baroque in France developed quite differently from the ornate and dramatic local versions of Baroque from Italy, Spain and the rest of Europe. It appears severe, more detached and restrained by comparison, preempting Neoclassicism and the architecture of the Enlightenment. Unlike Italian buildings, French Baroque buildings have no broken pediments or curvilinear façades. Even religious buildings avoided the intense spatial drama one finds in the work of Borromini. The style is closely associated with the works built for Louis XIV (reign 1643–1715), and because of this, it is also known as the Louis XIV style. Louis XIV invited the master of Baroque, Bernini, to submit a design for the new east wing of the Louvre, but rejected it in favor of a more classical design by Claude Perrault and Louis Le Vau.

The main architects of the style included François Mansart (1598–1666), Pierre Le Muet (Church of Val-de-Grâce, 1645–1665) and Louis Le Vau (Vaux-le-Vicomte, 1657–1661). Mansart was the first architect to introduce Baroque styling, principally the frequent use of an applied order and heavy rustication, into the French architectural vocabulary. The mansard roof was not invented by Mansart, but it has become associated with him, as he used it frequently.

The major royal project of the period was the expansion of Palace of Versailles, begun in 1661 by Le Vau with decoration by the painter Charles Le Brun. The gardens were designed by André Le Nôtre specifically to complement and amplify the architecture. The Galerie des Glaces (Hall of Mirrors), the centerpiece of the château, with paintings by Le Brun, was constructed between 1678 and 1686. Mansart completed the Grand Trianon in 1687. The chapel, designed by Robert de Cotte, was finished in 1710. Following the death of Louis XIV, Louis XV added the more intimate Petit Trianon and the highly ornate theatre. The fountains in the gardens were designed to be seen from the interior, and to add to the dramatic effect. The palace was admired and copied by other monarchs of Europe, particularly Peter the Great of Russia, who visited Versailles early in the reign of Louis XV, and built his own version at Peterhof Palace near Saint Petersburg, between 1705 and 1725.

===Portuguese Baroque===

Baroque architecture in Portugal lasted about two centuries (the late seventeenth century and eighteenth century). The reigns of John V and Joseph I had increased imports of gold and diamonds, in a period called Royal Absolutism, which allowed the Portuguese Baroque to flourish.

Baroque architecture in Portugal enjoys a special situation and different timeline from the rest of Europe.

It is conditioned by several political, artistic, and economic factors, that originate several phases, and different kinds of outside influences, resulting in a unique blend, often misunderstood by those looking for Italian art, find instead specific forms and character which give it a uniquely Portuguese variety. Another key factor is the existence of the Jesuitical architecture, also called &quot;plain style&quot; (Estilo Chão or Estilo Plano) which like the name evokes, is plainer and appears somewhat austere.

The buildings are single-room basilicas, deep main chapel, lateral chapels (with small doors for communication), without interior and exterior decoration, simple portal and windows. 
It is a practical building, allowing it to be built throughout the empire with minor adjustments, and prepared to be decorated later or when economic resources are available.

In fact, the first Portuguese Baroque does not lack in building because &quot;plain style&quot; is easy to be transformed, by means of decoration (painting, tiling, etc.), turning empty areas into pompous, elaborate baroque scenarios. The same could be applied to the exterior. Subsequently, it is easy to adapt the building to the taste of the time and place, and add on new features and details. Practical and economical.

With more inhabitants and better economic resources, the north, particularly the areas of Porto and Braga, witnessed an architectural renewal, visible in the large list of churches, convents and palaces built by the aristocracy.

Porto is the city of Baroque in Portugal. Its historical centre is part of UNESCO World Heritage List.

Many of the Baroque works in the historical area of the city and beyond, belong to Nicolau Nasoni an Italian architect living in Portugal, drawing original buildings with scenographic emplacement such as the church and tower of Clérigos, the logia of the Porto Cathedral, the church of Misericórdia, the Palace of São João Novo, the Palace of Freixo, the Episcopal Palace (Portuguese: &quot;Paço Episcopal do Porto&quot;) along with many others.

===Russian Baroque===
The debut of Russian Baroque, or Petrine Baroque, followed a long visit of Peter the Great to western Europe in 1697–1698, where he visited the Châteaux of Fontainebleau and Versailles as well as other architectural monuments. He decided, on his return to Russia, to construct similar monuments in St. Petersburg, which became the new capital of Russia in 1712. Early major monuments in the Petrine Baroque include the Peter and Paul Cathedral and Menshikov Palace.

During the reign of Anna and Elisabeth, Russian architecture was dominated by the luxurious Baroque style of Italian-born Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli, which developed into Elizabethan Baroque. Rastrelli&#x27;s signature buildings include the Winter Palace, the Catherine Palace and the Smolny Cathedral. Other distinctive monuments of the Elizabethan Baroque are the bell tower of the Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra and the Red Gate.

In Moscow, Naryshkin Baroque became widespread, especially in the architecture of Eastern Orthodox churches in the late 17th century. It was a combination of western European Baroque with traditional Russian folk styles.

===Baroque in the Spanish and Portuguese Colonial Americas===

Due to the colonization of the Americas by European countries, the Baroque naturally moved to the New World, finding especially favorable ground in the regions dominated by Spain and Portugal, both countries being centralized and irreducibly Catholic monarchies, by extension subject to Rome and adherents of the Baroque Counter-Reformation. European artists migrated to America and made school, and along with the widespread penetration of Catholic missionaries, many of whom were skilled artists, created a multiform Baroque often influenced by popular taste. The Criollo and indigenous crafters did much to give this Baroque unique features. The main centres of American Baroque cultivation, that are still standing, are (in this order) Mexico, Peru, Brazil, Cuba, Ecuador, Colombia, Bolivia, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Puerto Rico and Panama.

Of particular note is the so-called &quot;Missionary Baroque&quot;, developed in the framework of the Spanish reductions in areas extending from Mexico and southwestern portions of current-day United States to as far south as Argentina and Chile, indigenous settlements organized by Spanish Catholic missionaries in order to convert them to the Christian faith and acculturate them in the Western life, forming a hybrid Baroque influenced by Native culture, where flourished Criollos and many indigenous artisans and musicians, even literate, some of great ability and talent of their own. Missionaries&#x27; accounts often repeat that Western art, especially music, had a hypnotic impact on foresters, and the images of saints were viewed as having great powers. Many natives were converted, and a new form of devotion was created, of passionate intensity, laden with mysticism, superstition, and theatricality, which delighted in festive masses, sacred concerts, and mysteries.

The Colonial Baroque architecture in the Spanish America is characterized by a profuse decoration (portal of La Profesa Church, Mexico City; façades covered with Puebla-style azulejos, as in the Church of San Francisco Acatepec in San Andrés Cholula and Convent Church of San Francisco, Puebla), which will be exacerbated in the so-called Churrigueresque style (Façade of the Tabernacle of the Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral, by Lorenzo Rodríguez; Church of San Francisco Javier, Tepotzotlán; Church of Santa Prisca de Taxco). In Peru, the constructions mostly developed in the cities of Lima, Cusco, Arequipa and Trujillo, since 1650 show original characteristics that are advanced even to the European Baroque, as in the use of cushioned walls and solomonic columns (Iglesia de la Compañía de Jesús, Cusco; Basilica and Convent of San Francisco, Lima). Other countries include: the Metropolitan Cathedral of Sucre in Bolivia; Cathedral Basilica of Esquipulas in Guatemala; Tegucigalpa Cathedral in Honduras; León Cathedral in Nicaragua; the Church of la Compañía de Jesús, Quito, Ecuador; the Church of San Ignacio, Bogotá, Colombia; the Caracas Cathedral in Venezuela; the Cabildo of Buenos Aires in Argentina; the Church of Santo Domingo in Santiago, Chile; and Havana Cathedral in Cuba. It is also worth remembering the quality of the churches of the Spanish Jesuit Missions in Bolivia, Spanish Jesuit missions in Paraguay, the Spanish missions in Mexico and the Spanish Franciscan missions in California.

In Brazil, as in the metropolis, Portugal, the architecture has a certain Italian influence, usually of a Borrominesque type, as can be seen in the Co-Cathedral of Recife (1784) and Church of Nossa Senhora da Glória do Outeiro in Rio de Janeiro (1739). In the region of Minas Gerais, highlighted the work of Aleijadinho, author of a group of churches that stand out for their curved planimetry, façades with concave-convex dynamic effects and a plastic treatment of all architectural elements (Church of São Francisco de Assis, Ouro Preto, 1765–1788).

===Baroque in the Spanish and Portuguese Colonial Asia===
In the Portuguese colonies of India (Goa, Daman and Diu) an architectural style of Baroque forms mixed with Hindu elements flourished, such as the Se Cathedral and the Basilica of Bom Jesus of Goa, which houses the tomb of St. Francis Xavier. The set of churches and convents of Goa was declared a World Heritage Site in 1986.

In the Philippines, which was a Spanish colony for over three centuries, a large number of Baroque constructions are preserved. Four of these as well as the Baroque and Neoclassical city of Vigan are both UNESCO World Heritage Sites; and although they lack formal classification, The Walled City of Manila along with the city of Tayabas both contain a significant extent of Spanish-Baroque-era architecture.

===Echoes in Wallachia and Moldavia===
As we saw, the Baroque is a Western style, born in Italy. Through the commercial and cultural relationships of Italians with countries of the Balkan Peninsula, including Moldavia and Wallachia, Baroque influences arrive to Eastern Europe. These influences were not very strong, since they usually take place in architecture and stone-sculpted ornaments, and are also mixed intensely with details taken from Byzantine and Islamic art.

Before and after the fall of the Byzantine Empire, all the art of Wallachia and Moldavia was primarily influenced by that of Constantinople. Until the end of the 16th century, with little modifications, the plans of churches and monasteries, the murals, and the ornaments carved in stone remain the same as before. From a period starting with the reigns of Matei Basarab (1632–1654) and Vasile Lupu (1634–1653), which coincided with the popularization of Italian Baroque, new ornaments were added, and the style of religious furniture changed. This was not random at all. Decorative elements and principles were brought from Italy, through Venice, or through the Dalmatian regions, and they were adopted by architects and craftsmen from the east. The window and door frames, the &quot;pisanie&quot; with dedication, the tombstones, the columns and railings, and a part of the bronze, silver or wooden furniture, received a more important role than the one they had before. They existed before too, inspired by the Byzantine tradition, but they gained a more realist look, showing delicate floral motifs. The relief that existed before too, became more accentuated, having volume and consistency. Before this period, reliefs from Wallachia and Moldavia, like the ones from the East, had only two levels, at a small distance one from the other, one at the surface and the other in depth. Big flowers, maybe roses, peonies or thistles, thick leaves, of acanthus or another similar plant, were twisting on columns, or surround door and windows. A place where the Baroque had a strong influence was columns and the railings. Capitals were more decorated than before with foliage. Columns have often twisting shafts, a local reinterpretation of the Solomonic column. Maximalist railings are placed between these columns, decorated with rinceaux. Some of the ones from the Mogoșoaia Palace are also decorated with dolphins. Cartouches are also used sometimes, mostly on tombstones, like on the one of Constantin Brâncoveanu. This movement, is known as the Brâncovenesc style, after Constantin Brâncoveanu, a ruler of Wallachia whose reign (1654–1714) is highly associated with this kind of architecture and design. The style is also present during the 18th century, and in a part of the 19th. Many of the churches and residences erected by boyards and voivodes of these periods are Brâncovenesc. Although Baroque influences can be clearly seen, the Brâncovenesc style takes much more inspiration from the local tradition.

As the 18th century passed, with the Phanariot (members of prominent Greek families in Phanar, Istanbul) reigns in Wallachia and Moldavia, Baroque influences come from Istanbul too. They came before too, during the 17th century, but with the Phanariots, more Western Baroque motifs that arrived to the Ottoman Empire had their final destination in present-day Romania. In Moldavia, Baroque elements come from Russia too, where the influence of Italian art was strong.

==Painting==

Baroque painters worked deliberately to set themselves apart from the painters of the Renaissance and the Mannerism period after it. In their palette, they used intense and warm colours, and particularly made use of the primary colours red, blue and yellow, frequently putting all three in close proximity. They avoided the even lighting of Renaissance painting and used strong contrasts of light and darkness on certain parts of the picture to direct attention to the central actions or figures. In their composition, they avoided the tranquil scenes of Renaissance paintings, and chose the moments of the greatest movement and drama. Unlike the tranquil faces of Renaissance paintings, the faces in Baroque paintings clearly expressed their emotions. They often used asymmetry, with action occurring away from the centre of the picture, and created axes that were neither vertical nor horizontal, but slanting to the left or right, giving a sense of instability and movement. They enhanced this impression of movement by having the costumes of the personages blown by the wind, or moved by their own gestures. The overall impressions were movement, emotion and drama. Another essential element of baroque painting was allegory; every painting told a story and had a message, often encrypted in symbols and allegorical characters, which an educated viewer was expected to know and read.

Early evidence of Italian Baroque ideas in painting occurred in Bologna, where Annibale Carracci, Agostino Carracci and Ludovico Carracci sought to return the visual arts to the ordered Classicism of the Renaissance. Their art, however, also incorporated ideas central the Counter-Reformation; these included intense emotion and religious imagery that appealed more to the heart than to the intellect.

Another influential painter of the Baroque era was Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio. His realistic approach to the human figure, painted directly from life and dramatically spotlit against a dark background, shocked his contemporaries and opened a new chapter in the history of painting. Other major painters associated closely with the Baroque style include Artemisia Gentileschi, Elisabetta Sirani, Giovanna Garzoni, Guido Reni, Domenichino, Andrea Pozzo, and Paolo de Matteis in Italy; Francisco de Zurbarán, Bartolomé Esteban Murillo and Diego Velázquez in Spain; Adam Elsheimer in Germany; and Nicolas Poussin and Georges de La Tour in France (though Poussin spent most of his working life in Italy). Poussin and de La Tour adopted a &quot;classical&quot; Baroque style with less focus on emotion and greater attention to the line of the figures in the painting than to colour.

Peter Paul Rubens was the most important painter of the Flemish Baroque style. Rubens&#x27; highly charged compositions reference erudite aspects of classical and Christian history. His unique and immensely popular Baroque style emphasised movement, colour, and sensuality, which followed the immediate, dramatic artistic style promoted in the Counter-Reformation. Rubens specialized in making altarpieces, portraits, landscapes, and history paintings of mythological and allegorical subjects.

One important domain of Baroque painting was &quot;Quadratura&quot;, or paintings in &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot;, which literally &quot;fooled the eye&quot;. These were usually painted on the stucco of ceilings or upper walls and balustrades, and gave the impression to those on the ground looking up were that they were seeing the heavens populated with crowds of angels, saints and other heavenly figures, set against painted skies and imaginary architecture.

In Italy, artists often collaborated with architects on interior decoration; Pietro da Cortona was one of the painters of the 17th century who employed this illusionist way of painting. Among his most important commissions were the frescoes he painted for the Palazzo Barberini (1633–39), to glorify the reign of Pope Urban VIII. Pietro da Cortona&#x27;s compositions were the largest decorative frescoes executed in Rome since the work of Michelangelo at the Sistine Chapel.

François Boucher was an important figure in the more delicate French Rococo style, which appeared during the late Baroque period. He designed tapestries, carpets and theatre decoration as well as painting. His work was extremely popular with Madame de Pompadour, the Mistress of King Louis XV. His paintings featured mythological romantic, and mildly erotic themes.

===Hispanic Americas===
In the Hispanic Americas, the first influences were from Sevillan Tenebrism, mainly from Zurbarán—some of whose works are still preserved in Mexico and Peru—as can be seen in the work of the Mexicans José Juárez and Sebastián López de Arteaga, and the Bolivian Melchor Pérez de Holguín. The Cusco School of painting arose after the arrival of the Italian painter Bernardo Bitti in 1583, who introduced Mannerism in the Americas. It highlighted the work of Luis de Riaño, disciple of the Italian Angelino Medoro, author of the murals of the Church of San Pedro, Andahuaylillas. It also highlighted the Indian (Quechua) painters Diego Quispe Tito and Basilio Santa Cruz Pumacallao, as well as Marcos Zapata, author of the fifty large canvases that cover the high arches of Cusco Cathedral. In Ecuador, the Quito School was formed, mainly represented by the mestizo Miguel de Santiago and the criollo Nicolás Javier de Goríbar.

In the 18th century sculptural altarpieces began to be replaced by paintings, developing notably the Baroque painting in the Americas. Similarly, the demand for civil works, mainly portraits of the aristocratic classes and the ecclesiastical hierarchy, grew. The main influence was the Murillesque, and in some cases—as in the criollo Cristóbal de Villalpando–that of Juan de Valdés Leal. The painting of this era has a more sentimental tone, with sweet and softer shapes. Its proponents include Gregorio Vasquez de Arce y Ceballos in Colombia, and Juan Rodríguez Juárez and Miguel Cabrera in Mexico.

==Sculpture==

The dominant figure in baroque sculpture was Gian Lorenzo Bernini. Under the patronage of Pope Urban VIII, he made a remarkable series of monumental statues of saints and figures whose faces and gestures vividly expressed their emotions, as well as portrait busts of exceptional realism, and highly decorative works for the Vatican such as the imposing Chair of St. Peter beneath the dome in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. In addition, he designed fountains with monumental groups of sculpture to decorate the major squares of Rome.

Baroque sculpture was inspired by ancient Roman statuary, particularly by the famous first century CE statue of &quot;Laocoön and His Sons&quot;, which was unearthed in 1506 and put on display in the gallery of the Vatican. When he visited Paris in 1665, Bernini addressed the students at the academy of painting and sculpture. He advised the students to work from classical models, rather than from nature. He told the students, &quot;When I had trouble with my first statue, I consulted the &quot;Antinous&quot; like an oracle.&quot; That &quot;Antinous&quot; statue is known today as the Hermes of the Museo Pio-Clementino.

Notable late French baroque sculptors included Étienne Maurice Falconet and Jean Baptiste Pigalle. Pigalle was commissioned by Frederick the Great to make statues for Frederick&#x27;s own version of Versailles at Sanssouci in Potsdam, Germany. Falconet also received an important foreign commission, creating the famous &quot;Bronze Horseman&quot; statue of Peter the Great found in St. Petersburg.

In Spain, the sculptor Francisco Salzillo worked exclusively on religious themes, using polychromed wood. Some of the finest baroque sculptural craftsmanship was found in the gilded stucco altars of churches of the Spanish colonies of the New World, made by local craftsmen; examples include the Chapel del Rosario, Puebla, (Mexico), 1724–1731.

==Furniture==

The main motifs used are: horns of plenty, festoons, baby angels, lion heads holding a metal ring in their mouths, female faces surrounded by garlands, oval cartouches, acanthus leaves, classical columns, caryatids, pediments, and other elements of Classical architecture sculpted on some parts of pieces of furniture, baskets with fruits or flowers, shells, armour and trophies, heads of Apollo or Bacchus, and C-shaped volutes.

During the first period of the reign of Louis XIV, furniture followed the previous Louis XIII style, and was massive, and profusely decorated with sculpture and gilding. After 1680, thanks in large part to the furniture designer André-Charles Boulle, a more original and delicate style appeared, sometimes known as Boulle work. It was based on the inlay of ebony and other rare woods, a technique first used in Florence in the 15th century, which was refined and developed by Boulle and others working for Louis XIV. Furniture was inlaid with plaques of ebony, copper, and exotic woods of different colors.

New and often enduring types of furniture appeared; the commode, with two to four drawers, replaced the old &quot;coffre&quot;, or chest. The &quot;canapé&quot;, or sofa, appeared, in the form of a combination of two or three armchairs. New kinds of armchairs appeared, including the &quot;fauteuil en confessionale&quot; or &quot;Confessional armchair&quot;, which had padded cushions ions on either side of the back of the chair. The console table also made its first appearance; it was designed to be placed against a wall. Another new type of furniture was the &quot;table à gibier&quot;, a marble-topped table for holding dishes. Early varieties of the desk appeared; the Mazarin desk had a central section set back, placed between two columns of drawers, with four feet on each column.

==Music==
The term &quot;Baroque&quot; is also used to designate the style of music composed during a period that overlaps with that of Baroque art. The first uses of the term &#x27;baroque&#x27; for music were criticisms. In an anonymous, satirical review of the première in October 1733 of Jean-Philippe Rameau&#x27;s &quot;Hippolyte et Aricie,&quot; printed in the &quot;Mercure de France&quot; in May 1734, the critic implied that the novelty of this opera was &quot;du barocque,&quot; complaining that the music lacked coherent melody, was filled with unremitting dissonances, constantly changed key and meter, and speedily ran through every compositional device. Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who was a musician and noted composer as well as philosopher, made a very similar observation in 1768 in the famous &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; of Denis Diderot: &quot;Baroque music is that in which the harmony is confused, and loaded with modulations and dissonances. The singing is harsh and unnatural, the intonation difficult, and the movement limited. It appears that term comes from the word &#x27;baroco&#x27; used by logicians.&quot;

Common use of the term for the music of the period began only in 1919, by Curt Sachs, and it was not until 1940 that it was first used in English in an article published by Manfred Bukofzer.

The baroque was a period of musical experimentation and innovation which explains the amount of ornaments and improvisation performed by the musicians. New forms were invented, including the concerto and sinfonia. Opera was born in Italy at the end of the 16th century (with Jacopo Peri&#x27;s mostly lost &quot;Dafne&quot;, produced in Florence in 1598) and soon spread through the rest of Europe: Louis XIV created the first Royal Academy of Music. In 1669, the poet Pierre Perrin opened an academy of opera in Paris, the first opera theatre in France open to the public, and premiered &quot;Pomone&quot;, the first grand opera in French, with music by Robert Cambert, with five acts, elaborate stage machinery, and a ballet. Heinrich Schütz in Germany, Jean-Baptiste Lully in France, and Henry Purcell in England all helped to establish their national traditions in the 17th century.

Several new instruments, including the piano, were introduced during this period. The invention of the piano is credited to Bartolomeo Cristofori (1655–1731) of Padua, Italy, who was employed by Ferdinando de&#x27; Medici, Grand Prince of Tuscany, as the Keeper of the Instruments. Cristofori named the instrument &quot;un cimbalo di cipresso di piano e forte&quot; (&quot;a keyboard of cypress with soft and loud&quot;), abbreviated over time as &quot;pianoforte&quot;, &quot;fortepiano&quot;, and later, simply, piano.

==Dance==

The classical ballet also originated in the Baroque era. The style of court dance was brought to France by Marie de&#x27; Medici, and in the beginning the members of the court themselves were the dancers. Louis XIV himself performed in public in several ballets. In March 1662, the Académie Royale de Danse, was founded by the King. It was the first professional dance school and company, and set the standards and vocabulary for ballet throughout Europe during the period.

==Literary theory==
Heinrich Wölfflin was the first to transfer the term Baroque to literature. The key concepts of Baroque literary theory, such as &quot;conceit&quot; (&quot;concetto&quot;), &quot;wit&quot; (&quot;acutezza&quot;, &quot;ingegno&quot;), and &quot;wonder&quot; (&quot;meraviglia&quot;), were not fully developed in literary theory until the publication of Emanuele Tesauro&#x27;s &quot;Il Cannocchiale aristotelico&quot; (The Aristotelian Telescope) in 1654. This seminal treatise - inspired by Giambattista Marino&#x27;s epic &quot;Adone&quot; and the work of the Spanish Jesuit philosopher Baltasar Gracián - developed a theory of metaphor as a universal language of images and as a supreme intellectual act, at once an artifice and an epistemologically privileged mode of access to truth.

==Theatre==

The Baroque period was a golden age for theatre in France and Spain; playwrights included Corneille, Racine and Molière in France; and Lope de Vega and Pedro Calderón de la Barca in Spain.

During the Baroque period, the art and style of the theatre evolved rapidly, alongside the development of opera and of ballet. The design of newer and larger theatres, the invention the use of more elaborate machinery, the wider use of the proscenium arch, which framed the stage and hid the machinery from the audience, encouraged more scenic effects and spectacle.

The Baroque had a Catholic and conservative character in Spain, following an Italian literary model during the Renaissance. The Hispanic Baroque theatre aimed for a public content with an ideal reality that manifested fundamental three sentiments: Catholic religion, monarchist and national pride and honour originating from the chivalric, knightly world.

Two periods are known in the Baroque Spanish theatre, with the division occurring in 1630. The first period is represented chiefly by Lope de Vega, but also by Tirso de Molina, Gaspar Aguilar, Guillén de Castro, Antonio Mira de Amescua, Luis Vélez de Guevara, Juan Ruiz de Alarcón, Diego Jiménez de Enciso, Luis Belmonte Bermúdez, Felipe Godínez, Luis Quiñones de Benavente or Juan Pérez de Montalbán. Many of these figures attended &quot;academias literarias&quot; (literary academies) including the famous Medrano Academy founded by Sebastián Francisco de Medrano. The second period is represented by Pedro Calderón de la Barca and fellow dramatists Antonio Hurtado de Mendoza, Álvaro Cubillo de Aragón, Jerónimo de Cáncer, Francisco de Rojas Zorrilla, Juan de Matos Fragoso, Antonio Coello y Ochoa, Agustín Moreto, and Francisco Bances Candamo. These classifications are loose because each author had his own way and could occasionally adhere himself to the formula established by Lope. It may even be that Lope&#x27;s &quot;manner&quot; was more liberal and structured than Calderón&#x27;s.

Lope de Vega introduced through his &quot;Arte nuevo de hacer comedias en este tiempo&quot; (1609) the &quot;new comedy&quot;. He established a new dramatic formula that broke the three Aristotle unities of the Italian school of poetry (action, time, and place) and a fourth unity of Aristotle which is about style, mixing of tragic and comic elements showing different types of verses and stanzas upon what is represented. Although Lope has a great knowledge of the plastic arts, he did not use it during the major part of his career nor in theatre or scenography. The Lope&#x27;s comedy granted a second role to the visual aspects of the theatrical representation.

Tirso de Molina, Lope de Vega, and Calderón were the most important play writers in Golden Era Spain. Their works, known for their subtle intelligence and profound comprehension of a person&#x27;s humanity, could be considered a bridge between Lope&#x27;s primitive comedy and the more elaborate comedy of Calderón. Tirso de Molina is best known for two works, &quot;The Convicted Suspicions&quot; and &quot;The Trickster of Seville&quot;, one of the first versions of the Don Juan myth.

Upon his arrival to Madrid, Cosimo Lotti brought to the Spanish court the most advanced theatrical techniques of Europe. His techniques and mechanic knowledge were applied in palace exhibitions called &quot;Fiestas&quot; and in lavish exhibitions of rivers or artificial fountains called &quot;Naumaquias&quot;. He was in charge of styling the Gardens of Buen Retiro, of Zarzuela, and of Aranjuez and the construction of the theatrical building of Coliseo del Buen Retiro. Lope&#x27;s formulas begin with a verse that it unbefitting of the palace theatre foundation and the birth of new concepts that begun the careers of some play writers like Calderón de la Barca. Marking the principal innovations of the New Lopesian Comedy, Calderón&#x27;s style marked many differences, with a great deal of constructive care and attention to his internal structure. Calderón&#x27;s work is in formal perfection and a very lyric and symbolic language. Liberty, vitality and openness of Lope gave a step to Calderón&#x27;s intellectual reflection and formal precision. In his comedy it reflected his ideological and doctrine intentions in above the passion and the action, the work of Autos sacramentales achieved high ranks. The genre of Comedia is political, multi-artistic and in a sense hybrid. The poetic text interweaved with Medias and resources originating from architecture, music and painting freeing the deception that is in the Lopesian comedy was made up from the lack of scenery and engaging the dialogue of action.

The best known German playwright was Andreas Gryphius, who used the Jesuit model of the Dutch Joost van den Vondel and Pierre Corneille. There was also Johannes Velten who combined the traditions of the English comedians and the commedia dell&#x27;arte with the classic theatre of Corneille and Molière. His touring company was perhaps the most significant and important of the 17th century.

The foremost Italian baroque tragedian was Federico Della Valle. His literary activity is summed up by the four plays that he wrote for the courtly theater: the tragicomedy &quot;Adelonda di Frigia&quot; (1595) and especially his three tragedies, &quot;Judith&quot; (1627), &quot;Esther&quot; (1627) and &quot;La reina di Scotia&quot; (1628). Della Valle had many imitators and followers who combined in their works Baroque taste and the didactic aims of the Jesuits (Francesco Sforza Pallavicino, Girolamo Graziani, etc.)

In the Tsardom of Russia, the development of the Russian version of Baroque took shape only in the second half of the 17th century, primarily due to the initiative of tsar Alexis of Russia, who wanted to open a court theatre in 1672. Its director and dramatist was Johann Gottfried Gregorii, a German-Russian Lutheran pastor, who wrote, in particular, a 10-hour play &quot;The Action of Artaxerxes&quot;. The dramaturgy of Symeon of Polotsk and Demetrius of Rostov became key contribution to the Russian Baroque.

===Spanish colonial Americas===
Following the evolution marked from Spain, at the end of the 16th century, the companies of comedians, essentially transhumant, began to professionalize. With professionalization came regulation and censorship: as in Europe, the theatre oscillated between tolerance and even government protection and rejection (with exceptions) or persecution by the Church. The theatre was useful to the authorities as an instrument to disseminate the desired behavior and models, respect for the social order and the monarchy, school of religious dogma.

The &quot;corrales&quot; were administered for the benefit of hospitals that shared the benefits of the representations. The itinerant companies (or &quot;of the league&quot;), who carried the theatre in improvised open-air stages by the regions that did not have fixed locals, required a viceregal license to work, whose price or &quot;pinción&quot; was destined to alms and works pious. For companies that worked stably in the capitals and major cities, one of their main sources of income was participation in the festivities of the Corpus Christi, which provided them with not only economic benefits, but also recognition and social prestige. The representations in the viceregal palace and the mansions of the aristocracy, where they represented both the comedies of their repertoire and special productions with great lighting effects, scenery, and stage, were also an important source of well-paid and prestigious work.

Born in the Viceroyalty of New Spain but later settled in Spain, Juan Ruiz de Alarcón is the most prominent figure in the Baroque theatre of New Spain. Despite his accommodation to Lope de Vega&#x27;s new comedy, his &quot;marked secularism&quot;, his discretion and restraint, and a keen capacity for &quot;psychological penetration&quot; as distinctive features of Alarcón against his Spanish contemporaries have been noted. Noteworthy among his works &quot;La verdad sospechosa&quot;, a comedy of characters that reflected his constant moralizing purpose. The dramatic production of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz places her as the second figure of the Spanish-American Baroque theatre. It is worth mentioning among her works the auto sacramental &quot;El divino Narciso&quot; and the comedy &quot;Los empeños de una casa&quot;.

==Gardens==

The Baroque garden, also known as the &quot;jardin à la française&quot; or French formal garden, first appeared in Rome in the 16th century, and then most famously in France in the 17th century in the gardens of Vaux le Vicomte and the Palace of Versailles. Baroque gardens were built by Kings and princes in Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Spain, Poland, Italy and Russia until the mid-18th century, when they began to be remade into by the more natural English landscape garden.

The purpose of the baroque garden was to illustrate the power of man over nature, and the glory of its builder, Baroque gardens were laid out in geometric patterns, like the rooms of a house. They were usually best seen from the outside and looking down, either from a château or terrace. The elements of a baroque garden included parterres of flower beds or low hedges trimmed into ornate Baroque designs, and straight lanes and alleys of gravel which divided and crisscrossed the garden. Terraces, ramps, staircases and cascades were placed where there were differences of elevation, and provided viewing points. Circular or rectangular ponds or basins of water were the settings for fountains and statues. Bosquets or carefully trimmed groves or lines of identical trees, gave the appearance of walls of greenery and were backdrops for statues. On the edges, the gardens usually had pavilions, orangeries and other structures where visitors could take shelter from the sun or rain.

Baroque gardens required enormous numbers of gardeners, continual trimming, and abundant water. In the later part of the Baroque period, the formal elements began to be replaced with more natural features, including winding paths, groves of varied trees left to grow untrimmed; rustic architecture and picturesque structures, such as Roman temples or Chinese pagodas, as well as &quot;secret gardens&quot; on the edges of the main garden, filled with greenery, where visitors could read or have quiet conversations. By the mid-18th century most of the Baroque gardens were partially or entirely transformed into variations of the English landscape garden.

Besides Versailles and Vaux-le-Vicomte, celebrated baroque gardens still retaining much of their original appearance include the Royal Palace of Caserta near Naples; Nymphenburg Palace and Augustusburg and Falkenlust Palaces, Brühl in Germany; Het Loo Palace, Netherlands; the Belvedere Palace in Vienna; Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso, Spain; and Peterhof Palace in St. Petersburg, Russia.

== Urban planning and design ==
16th through 19th century European cities witnessed a large change in urban design and planning principals that reshaped the landscapes and built environment. Rome, Paris, and other major cities were transformed to accommodate growing populations through improvements in housing, transportation, and public services. Throughout this time, the Baroque style was in full swing, and the influences of elaborate, dramatic, and artistic architectural styles extended into the urban fabric through what is known as Baroque urban planning. The experience of living and walking in the cities aims to complement the emotions of the Baroque style. This style of planning often embraced displaying the wealth and strength of the ruling powers, and the important buildings served as the visual and symbolic center of the cities.

The replanning of the city of Rome under the rule of Pope Sixtus V revived and expanded the city in the 16th century. Many grand piazzas and squares were added as public spaces to contribute to the dramatic effect of the Baroque style. The piazzas featured fountains and other decorative features to embody the emotions of the time. An important factor in Baroque style planning was to connect churches, government structures, and piazzas together in a refined network of axis&#x27;. This allowed the important landmarks of the Catholic Church to become the focal points of the city.

As another example of Baroque urban planning, Paris was in desperate need for an urban revival in the 19th century. The city underwent a dramatic change within its urban fabric through the help of Baron Haussmann. Under the rule of Napoleon III, Haussmann was appointed to reconstruct Paris by adding a new network of streets, parks, trains, and public services. Some of the characteristics of Haussmann&#x27;s design include straight, wide boulevards lined with trees, and short access to parks and green spaces. The plan highlights some important buildings, such as the Paris Opera House.

More characteristics of Baroque urban planning are embodied in Barcelona. The Eixample district, designed by Ildefons Cerdà, showcases wide avenues in a grid system with a few diagonal boulevards. The intersections are unique with octagonal blocks, which provide the streets with great visibility and light. Many works in this district come from architect Antoni Gaudí, who displays a unique style. Centered in the Eixample district design is the Sagrada Família by Gaudí, which poses great significance to the city.

==Posterity==
===Transition to rococo===

The Rococo is the final stage of the Baroque, and in many ways took the Baroque&#x27;s fundamental qualities of illusion and drama to their logical extremes. Beginning in France as a reaction against the heavy Baroque grandeur of Louis XIV&#x27;s court at the Palace of Versailles, the rococo movement became associated particularly with the powerful (1721–1764), the mistress of the new king, Louis XV (1710–1774). Because of this, the style was also known as &quot;Pompadour&quot;. Although it&#x27;s highly associated with the reign of Louis XV, it didn&#x27;t appear in this period. Multiple works from the last years of Louis XIV&#x27;s reign are examples of early Rococo. The name of the movement derives from the French , or pebble, and refers to stones and shells that decorate the interiors of caves, as similar shell forms became a common feature in Rococo design. It began as a design and decorative arts style, and was characterized by elegant flowing shapes. Architecture followed and then painting and sculpture. The French painter with whom the term Rococo is most often associated is Jean-Antoine Watteau, whose pastoral scenes, or , dominate the early part of the 18th century.

There are multiple similarities between Rococo and Baroque. Both styles insist on monumental forms, and so use continuous spaces, double columns or pilasters, and luxurious materials (including gilded elements). There also noticeable differences. Rococo designed freed themselves from the adherence to symmetry that had dominated architecture and design since the Renaissance. Many small objects, like ink pots or porcelain figures, but also some ornaments, are often asymmetrical. This goes hand in hand with the fact that most ornamentation consisted of interpretation of foliage and sea shells, not as many Classical ornaments inherited from the Renaissance like in Baroque. Another key difference is the fact that since the Baroque is the main cultural manifestation of the spirit of the Counter-Reformation, it is most often associated with ecclesiastical architecture. In contrast, the Rococo is mainly associated with palaces and domestic architecture. In Paris, the popularity of the Rococo coincided with the emergence of the salon as a new type of social gathering, the venues for which were often decorated in this style. Rococo rooms were typically smaller than their Baroque counterparts, reflecting a movement towards domestic intimacy. Colours also match this change, from the earthy tones of Caravaggio&#x27;s paintings, and the interiors of red marble and gilded mounts of the reign of Louis XIV, to the pastel and relaxed pale blue, Pompadour pink, and white of the Louis XV and Madame de Pompadour&#x27;s France. Similarly to colours, there was also a transition from serious, dramatic and moralistic subjects in painting and sculpture, to lighthearted and joyful themes.

One last difference between Baroque and Rococo is the interest that 18th century aristocrats had for East Asia. Chinoiserie was a style in fine art, architecture and design, popular during the 18th century, that was heavily inspired by Chinese art, but also by Rococo at the same time. Because traveling to China or other Far Eastern countries was hard at that time and so remained mysterious to most Westerners, European imagination were fuelled by perceptions of Asia as a place of wealth and luxury, and consequently patrons from emperors to merchants vied with each other in adorning their living quarters with Asian goods and decorating them in Asian styles. Where Asian objects were hard to obtain, European craftsmen and painters stepped up to fill the demand, creating a blend of Rococo forms and Asian figures, motifs and techniques. Aside from European recreations of objects in East Asian style, Chinese lacquerware was reused in multiple ways. European aristocrats fully decorated a handful of rooms of palaces, with Chinese lacquer panels used as wall panels. Due to its aspect, black lacquer was popular for Western men&#x27;s studies. Those panels used were usually glossy and black, made in the Henan province of China. They were made of multiple layers of lacquer, then incised with motifs in-filled with colour and gold. Chinese, but also Japanese lacquer panels were also used by some 18th century European carpenters for making furniture. In order to be produced, Asian screens were dismantled and used to veneer European-made furniture.

===Condemnation and academic rediscovery===
The pioneer German art historian and archeologist Johann Joachim Winckelmann also condemned the baroque style, and praised the superior values of classical art and architecture. By the 19th century, Baroque was a target for ridicule and criticism. The neoclassical critic Francesco Milizia wrote: &quot;Borrominini in architecture, Bernini in sculpture, Pietro da Cortona in painting...are a plague on good taste, which infected a large number of artists.&quot; In the 19th century, criticism went even further; the British critic John Ruskin declared that baroque sculpture was not only bad, but also morally corrupt.

The Swiss-born art historian Heinrich Wölfflin (1864–1945) started the rehabilitation of the word Baroque in his &quot;Renaissance und Barock&quot; (1888); Wölfflin identified the Baroque as &quot;movement imported into mass&quot;, an art antithetic to Renaissance art. He did not make the distinctions between Mannerism and Baroque that modern writers do, and he ignored the later phase, the academic Baroque that lasted into the 18th century. Baroque art and architecture became fashionable in the interwar period, and has largely remained in critical favor. The term &quot;Baroque&quot; may still be used, often pejoratively, describing works of art, craft, or design that are thought to have excessive ornamentation or complexity of line. At the same time &quot;baroque&quot; has become an accepted terms for various trends in Roman art and Roman architecture in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, which display some of the same characteristics as the later Baroque.

===Revivals and influence through eclecticism===

Highly criticized, the Baroque would later be a source of inspiration for artists, architects and designers during the 19th century through Romanticism, a movement that developed in the 18th century and that reached its peak in the 19th. It was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism, as well as glorification of the past and nature, preferring the medieval to the classical. A mix of literary, religious, and political factors prompted late-18th and 19th century British architects and designers to look back to the Middle Ages for inspiration. Romanticism is the reason the 19th century is best known as the century of revivals. In France, Romanticism was not the key factor that led to the revival of Gothic architecture and design. Vandalism of monuments and buildings associated with the Ancien Régime (Old Regime) happened during the French Revolution. Because of this an archaeologist, Alexandre Lenoir, was appointed curator of the Petits-Augustins depot, where sculptures, statues and tombs removed from churches, abbeys and convents had been transported. He organized the Museum of French Monuments (1795–1816), and was the first to bring back the taste for the art of the Middle Ages, which progressed slowly to flourish a quarter of a century later.

This taste and revival of medieval art led to the revival of other periods, including the Baroque and Rococo. Revivalism started with themes first from the Middle Ages, then, towards the end of the reign of Louis Philippe I (1830–1848), from the Renaissance. Baroque and Rococo inspiration was more popular during the reign of Napoleon III (1852–1870), and continued later, after the fall of the Second French Empire.

Compared to how in England architects and designers saw the Gothic as a national style, Rococo was seen as one of the most representative movements for France. The French felt much more connected to the styles of the Ancien Régime and Napoleon&#x27;s Empire, than to the medieval or Renaissance past, although Gothic architecture appeared in France, not in England.

The revivalism of the 19th century led in time to eclecticism (mix of elements of different styles). Because architects often revived Classical styles, most Eclectic buildings and designs have a distinctive look. Besides pure revivals, the Baroque was also one of the main sources of inspiration for eclecticism. The coupled column and the giant order, two elements widely used in Baroque, are often present in this kind of 19th and early 20th century buildings. Eclecticism was not limited only to architecture. Many designs from the Second Empire style (1848–1870) have elements taken from different styles. Little furniture from the period escaped its three most prevalent historicist influences, which are sometimes kept distinct and sometimes combined: the Renaissance, Louis XV (Rococo), and Louis XVI styles. Revivals and inspiration also came sometimes from Baroque, like in the case of remakes and arabesques that imitate Boulle marquetry, and from other styles, like Gothic, Renaissance, or English Regency.

The Belle Époque was a period that begun around 1871–1880 and that ended with the outbreak of World War I in 1914. It was characterized by optimism, regional peace, economic prosperity, colonial expansion, and technological, scientific, and cultural innovations. Eclecticism reached its peak in this period, with Beaux Arts architecture. The style takes its name from the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where it developed and where many of the main exponents of the style studied. Buildings in this style often feature Ionic columns with their volues on the corner (like those found in French Baroque), a rusticated basement level, overall simplicity but with some really detailed parts, arched doors, and an arch above the entrance like the one of the Petit Palais in Paris. The style aimed for a Baroque opulence through lavishly decorated monumental structures that evoked Louis XIV&#x27;s Versailles. When it comes to the design of the Belle Époque, all furniture from the past was admired, including, perhaps, contrary to expectations, the Second Empire style (the style of the proceeding period), which remained popular until 1900. In the years around 1900, there was a gigantic recapitulation of styles of all countries in all preceding periods. Everything from Chinese to Spanish models, from Boulle to Gothic, found its way into furniture production, but some styles were more appreciated than others. The High Middle Ages and the early Renaissance were especially prized. Exoticism of every stripe and exuberant Rococo designs were also favoured.

Revivals and influence of the Baroque faded away and disappeared with Art Deco, a style created as a collective effort of multiple French designers to make a new modern style around 1910. It was obscure before WW1, but became very popular during the interwar period, being heavily associated with the 1920s and the 1930s. The movement was a blend of multiple characteristics taken from Modernist currents from the 1900s and the 1910s, like the Vienna Secession, Cubism, Fauvism, Primitivism, Suprematism, Constructivism, Futurism, De Stijl, and Expressionism. Besides Modernism, elements taken from styles popular during the Belle Époque, like Rococo Revival, Neoclassicism, or the neo-Louis XVI style, are also present in Art Deco. The proportions, volumes and structure of Beaux Arts architecture before WW1 is present in early Art Deco buildings of the 1910s and 1920s. Elements taken from Baroque are quite rare, architects and designers preferring the Louis XVI style.

At the end of the interwar period, with the rise in popularity of the International Style, characterized by the complete lack of any ornamentation led to the complete abandonment of influence and revivals of the Baroque. Multiple International Style architects and designers, but also Modernist artists criticized Baroque for its extravagance and what they saw as &quot;excess&quot;. Ironically this was just at the same time as the critical appreciation of the original Baroque was reviving strongly.

===Postmodern appreciation and reinterpretations===

Appreciation for the Baroque reappeared with the rise of Postmodernism, a movement that questioned Modernism (the status quo after WW2), and which promoted the inclusion of elements of historic styles in new designs, and appreciation for the pre-Modernist past. Specific references to Baroque are rare, since Postmodernism often included highly simplified elements that were &#x27;quotations&#x27; of Classicism in general, like pediments or columns.

More references to Baroque are found in Versace ceramic ware and fashion, decorated with maximalist acanthus rinceaux, very similar to the ones found in Italian Baroque ornament plates and in Boulle work, but also similar to the ones found on Empire objects, especially textiles, from the reign of Napoleon I.

<text>In abstract algebra, a Boolean algebra or Boolean lattice is a complemented distributive lattice. This type of algebraic structure captures essential properties of both set operations and logic operations. A Boolean algebra can be seen as a generalization of a power set algebra or a field of sets, or its elements can be viewed as generalized truth values. It is also a special case of a De Morgan algebra and a Kleene algebra (with involution).

Every Boolean algebra gives rise to a Boolean ring, and vice versa, with ring multiplication corresponding to conjunction or meet ∧, and ring addition to exclusive disjunction or symmetric difference (not disjunction ∨). However, the theory of Boolean rings has an inherent asymmetry between the two operators, while the axioms and theorems of Boolean algebra express the symmetry of the theory described by the duality principle.

== History ==
The term &quot;Boolean algebra&quot; honors George Boole (1815–1864), a self-educated English mathematician. He introduced the algebraic system initially in a small pamphlet, &quot;The Mathematical Analysis of Logic&quot;, published in 1847 in response to an ongoing public controversy between Augustus De Morgan and William Hamilton, and later as a more substantial book, &quot;The Laws of Thought&quot;, published in 1854. Boole&#x27;s formulation differs from that described above in some important respects. For example, conjunction and disjunction in Boole were not a dual pair of operations. Boolean algebra emerged in the 1860s, in papers written by William Jevons and Charles Sanders Peirce. The first systematic presentation of Boolean algebra and distributive lattices is owed to the 1890 &quot;Vorlesungen&quot; of Ernst Schröder. The first extensive treatment of Boolean algebra in English is A. N. Whitehead&#x27;s 1898 &quot;Universal Algebra&quot;. Boolean algebra as an axiomatic algebraic structure in the modern axiomatic sense begins with a 1904 paper by Edward V. Huntington. Boolean algebra came of age as serious mathematics with the work of Marshall Stone in the 1930s, and with Garrett Birkhoff&#x27;s 1940 &quot;Lattice Theory&quot;. In the 1960s, Paul Cohen, Dana Scott, and others found deep new results in mathematical logic and axiomatic set theory using offshoots of Boolean algebra, namely forcing and Boolean-valued models.

== Definition ==

A Boolean algebra is a set , equipped with two binary operations (called &quot;meet&quot; or &quot;and&quot;), (called &quot;join&quot; or &quot;or&quot;), a unary operation (called &quot;complement&quot; or &quot;not&quot;) and two elements and in (called &quot;bottom&quot; and &quot;top&quot;, or &quot;least&quot; and &quot;greatest&quot; element, also denoted by the symbols and , respectively), such that for all elements , and of , the following axioms hold:
Note, however, that the absorption law and even the associativity law can be excluded from the set of axioms as they can be derived from the other axioms (see Proven properties).

A Boolean algebra with only one element is called a trivial Boolean algebra or a degenerate Boolean algebra. (In older works, some authors required and to be &quot;distinct&quot; elements in order to exclude this case.)

It follows from the last three pairs of axioms above (identity, distributivity and complements), or from the absorption axiom, that
:     if and only if     .
The relation defined by if these equivalent conditions hold, is a partial order with least element 0 and greatest element 1. The meet and the join of two elements coincide with their infimum and supremum, respectively, with respect to ≤.

The first four pairs of axioms constitute a definition of a bounded lattice.

It follows from the first five pairs of axioms that any complement is unique.

The set of axioms is self-dual in the sense that if one exchanges with and with in an axiom, the result is again an axiom. Therefore, by applying this operation to a Boolean algebra (or Boolean lattice), one obtains another Boolean algebra with the same elements; it is called its dual.

== Examples ==

* The simplest non-trivial Boolean algebra, the two-element Boolean algebra, has only two elements, and , and is defined by the rules:
:* It has applications in logic, interpreting as &quot;false&quot;, as &quot;true&quot;, as &quot;and&quot;, as &quot;or&quot;, and as &quot;not&quot;. Expressions involving variables and the Boolean operations represent statement forms, and two such expressions can be shown to be equal using the above axioms if and only if the corresponding statement forms are logically equivalent.

:* The two-element Boolean algebra is also used for circuit design in electrical engineering; here 0 and 1 represent the two different states of one bit in a digital circuit, typically high and low voltage. Circuits are described by expressions containing variables, and two such expressions are equal for all values of the variables if and only if the corresponding circuits have the same input–output behavior. Furthermore, every possible input–output behavior can be modeled by a suitable Boolean expression.

:* The two-element Boolean algebra is also important in the general theory of Boolean algebras, because an equation involving several variables is generally true in all Boolean algebras if and only if it is true in the two-element Boolean algebra (which can be checked by a trivial brute force algorithm for small numbers of variables). This can for example be used to show that the following laws (&quot;Consensus theorems&quot;) are generally valid in all Boolean algebras:
:** 

* The power set (set of all subsets) of any given nonempty set forms a Boolean algebra, an algebra of sets, with the two operations (union) and (intersection). The smallest element 0 is the empty set and the largest element is the set itself.

:* After the two-element Boolean algebra, the simplest Boolean algebra is that defined by the power set of two atoms:
* The set of all subsets of that are either finite or cofinite is a Boolean algebra and an algebra of sets called the finite–cofinite algebra. If is infinite then the set of all cofinite subsets of , which is called the Fréchet filter, is a free ultrafilter on . However, the Fréchet filter is not an ultrafilter on the power set of . 
* Starting with the propositional calculus with sentence symbols, form the Lindenbaum algebra (that is, the set of sentences in the propositional calculus modulo logical equivalence). This construction yields a Boolean algebra. It is in fact the free Boolean algebra on generators. A truth assignment in propositional calculus is then a Boolean algebra homomorphism from this algebra to the two-element Boolean algebra.
* Given any linearly ordered set with a least element, the interval algebra is the smallest Boolean algebra of subsets of containing all of the half-open intervals such that is in and is either in or equal to . Interval algebras are useful in the study of Lindenbaum–Tarski algebras; every countable Boolean algebra is isomorphic to an interval algebra.
* For any natural number , the set of all positive divisors of , defining if divides , forms a distributive lattice. This lattice is a Boolean algebra if and only if is square-free. The bottom and the top elements of this Boolean algebra are the natural numbers and , respectively. The complement of is given by . The meet and the join of and are given by the greatest common divisor () and the least common multiple () of and , respectively. The ring addition is given by . The picture shows an example for . As a counter-example, considering the non-square-free , the greatest common divisor of 30 and its complement 2 would be 2, while it should be the bottom element 1.
* Other examples of Boolean algebras arise from topological spaces: if is a topological space, then the collection of all subsets of that are both open and closed forms a Boolean algebra with the operations (union) and (intersection).
* If is an arbitrary ring then its set of &quot;central idempotents&quot;, which is the set
formula_1
becomes a Boolean algebra when its operations are defined by and .

== Homomorphisms and isomorphisms ==
A &quot;homomorphism&quot; between two Boolean algebras and is a function such that for all , in :
: ,
: .

It then follows that for all in . The class of all Boolean algebras, together with this notion of morphism, forms a full subcategory of the category of lattices.
An &quot;isomorphism&quot; between two Boolean algebras and is a homomorphism with an inverse homomorphism, that is, a homomorphism such that the composition is the identity function on , and the composition is the identity function on . A homomorphism of Boolean algebras is an isomorphism if and only if it is bijective.

== Boolean rings ==

Every Boolean algebra gives rise to a ring by defining (this operation is called symmetric difference in the case of sets and XOR in the case of logic) and . The zero element of this ring coincides with the 0 of the Boolean algebra; the multiplicative identity element of the ring is the of the Boolean algebra. This ring has the property that for all in ; rings with this property are called Boolean rings.

Conversely, if a Boolean ring is given, we can turn it into a Boolean algebra by defining and .
Since these two constructions are inverses of each other, we can say that every Boolean ring arises from a Boolean algebra, and vice versa. Furthermore, a map is a homomorphism of Boolean algebras if and only if it is a homomorphism of Boolean rings. The categories of Boolean rings and Boolean algebras are equivalent; in fact the categories are isomorphic.

Hsiang (1985) gave a rule-based algorithm to check whether two arbitrary expressions denote the same value in every Boolean ring.

More generally, Boudet, Jouannaud, and Schmidt-Schauß (1989) gave an algorithm to solve equations between arbitrary Boolean-ring expressions.
Employing the similarity of Boolean rings and Boolean algebras, both algorithms have applications in automated theorem proving.

== Ideals and filters ==

An &quot;ideal&quot; of the Boolean algebra is a nonempty subset such that for all , in we have in and for all in we have in . This notion of ideal coincides with the notion of ring ideal in the Boolean ring . An ideal of is called &quot;prime&quot; if and if in always implies in or in . Furthermore, for every we have that , and then if is prime we have or for every . An ideal of is called &quot;maximal&quot; if and if the only ideal properly containing is itself. For an ideal , if and , then or is contained in another proper ideal . Hence, such an is not maximal, and therefore the notions of prime ideal and maximal ideal are equivalent in Boolean algebras. Moreover, these notions coincide with ring theoretic ones of prime ideal and maximal ideal in the Boolean ring .

The dual of an &quot;ideal&quot; is a &quot;filter&quot;. A &quot;filter&quot; of the Boolean algebra is a nonempty subset such that for all , in we have in and for all in we have in . The dual of a &quot;maximal&quot; (or &quot;prime&quot;) &quot;ideal&quot; in a Boolean algebra is &quot;ultrafilter&quot;. Ultrafilters can alternatively be described as 2-valued morphisms from to the two-element Boolean algebra. The statement &quot;every filter in a Boolean algebra can be extended to an ultrafilter&quot; is called the &quot;ultrafilter lemma&quot; and cannot be proven in Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZF), if ZF is consistent. Within ZF, the ultrafilter lemma is strictly weaker than the axiom of choice.
The ultrafilter lemma has many equivalent formulations: &quot;every Boolean algebra has an ultrafilter&quot;, &quot;every ideal in a Boolean algebra can be extended to a prime ideal&quot;, etc.

== Representations ==

It can be shown that every &quot;finite&quot; Boolean algebra is isomorphic to the Boolean algebra of all subsets of a finite set. Therefore, the number of elements of every finite Boolean algebra is a power of two.

Stone&#x27;s celebrated &quot;representation theorem for Boolean algebras&quot; states that &quot;every&quot; Boolean algebra is isomorphic to the Boolean algebra of all clopen sets in some (compact totally disconnected Hausdorff) topological space.

== Axiomatics ==


The first axiomatization of Boolean lattices/algebras in general was given by the English philosopher and mathematician Alfred North Whitehead in 1898.
It included the above axioms and additionally and .
In 1904, the American mathematician Edward V. Huntington (1874–1952) gave probably the most parsimonious axiomatization based on , , , even proving the associativity laws (see box).
He also proved that these axioms are independent of each other.
In 1933, Huntington set out the following elegant axiomatization for Boolean algebra. It requires just one binary operation and a unary functional symbol , to be read as &#x27;complement&#x27;, which satisfy the following laws:

Herbert Robbins immediately asked: If the Huntington equation is replaced with its dual, to wit:

do (1), (2), and (4) form a basis for Boolean algebra? Calling (1), (2), and (4) a &quot;Robbins algebra&quot;, the question then becomes: Is every Robbins algebra a Boolean algebra? This question (which came to be known as the Robbins conjecture) remained open for decades, and became a favorite question of Alfred Tarski and his students. In 1996, William McCune at Argonne National Laboratory, building on earlier work by Larry Wos, Steve Winker, and Bob Veroff, answered Robbins&#x27;s question in the affirmative: Every Robbins algebra is a Boolean algebra. Crucial to McCune&#x27;s proof was the computer program EQP he designed. For a simplification of McCune&#x27;s proof, see Dahn (1998).

Further work has been done for reducing the number of axioms; see Minimal axioms for Boolean algebra.

== Generalizations ==

Removing the requirement of existence of a unit from the axioms of Boolean algebra yields &quot;generalized Boolean algebras&quot;. Formally, a distributive lattice is a generalized Boolean lattice, if it has a smallest element and for any elements and in such that , there exists an element such that and . Defining as the unique such that and , we say that the structure is a &quot;generalized Boolean algebra&quot;, while is a &quot;generalized Boolean semilattice&quot;. Generalized Boolean lattices are exactly the ideals of Boolean lattices.

A structure that satisfies all axioms for Boolean algebras except the two distributivity axioms is called an orthocomplemented lattice. Orthocomplemented lattices arise naturally in quantum logic as lattices of closed linear subspaces for separable Hilbert spaces.

<text>The Bank of Italy (Italian: &quot;Banca d&#x27;Italia&quot;, , informally referred to as &quot;Bankitalia&quot;) is the Italian member of the Eurosystem and has been the monetary authority for Italy from 1893 to 1998, issuing the Italian lira. Since 2014, it has also been Italy&#x27;s national competent authority within European Banking Supervision. It is located in Palazzo Koch, via Nazionale, Rome.

==History==
The institution was established in 1893 from the combination of three major banks in Italy (after the Banca Romana scandal). The new central bank first issued banknotes during 1926. Until 1928, it was directed by a general manager, after this time instead by a governor elected by an internal commission of managers, with a decree from the President of the Italian Republic, for a term of seven years.

In 1863 the crisis of the world money market created panic and the rush to the counters to collect the metallic currency in exchange for the banknotes. The Italian government responded in 1866 by introducing the fiat and legal tender of paper money. The government was accused in this way of favouring the issuing banks, and a long debate called the &quot;banking question&quot; arose about the advisability of having one or more issuers.

The Minghetti-Finali law of 1873 established the mandatory consortium of issuing institutions among the six existing issuing institutions, the National Bank of the Kingdom of Italy, Banca Nazionale Toscana, Banca Toscana di Credito, Banca Romana, Banco di Napoli, and Banco di Sicilia; but the measure proved insufficient.

Following the Banca Romana scandal, the reorganization of the issuing institutions became necessary.

=== Establishment ===
Law no. 449 of 10 August 1893 of the Giolitti I government established the Bank of Italy through the merger of four banks: the National Bank in the Kingdom of Italy (formerly Banca Nazionale in the Sardinian States), the Banca Nazionale Toscana, the Banca Toscana di Credito for the Industries and Commerce of Italy and with the liquidation management of Banca Romana. With a complex series of mergers between these banks, the current Bank of Italy was formed. Some families of bankers, historical partners: Bombrini, Bastogi, Balduino, were the supporters of the operation. The institute enjoyed (together with the Banks of Naples and Sicily) the issuing privilege, it also acted as a &quot;bank of banks&quot; through the rediscount of bills, but did not have supervisory powers over other banks. The bank remains a private limited company and was headed by a director.

From 1900 to 1928 Bonaldo Stringher was the director, who gave the Bank the role of manager of Italian monetary policy and lender of last resort, bringing it closer to a modern central bank. In particular, he understood that a central bank cannot aim at maximizing profit (which is achieved by printing as much paper money) but must instead aim at price stability.

In 1907, the Bank of Italy coordinated the rescue of the Italian Banking Company, a major lender of FIAT, an operation that ended with the absorption of the bank in crisis into the Italian Discount Bank. In 1911 the central bank organized a consortium to rescue the steel companies (Acciaierie di Terni, Ilva and others) of which the Bank of Italy was directly creditor, financing the operation also through the issue of banknotes.

In 1912 the credit institute for cooperation, with social purposes, was established, led by the Bank of Italy and also participated by public bodies, savings banks, Monte dei Paschi di Siena, the Cassa di Previdenza, and the Credit Institution for the Cooperatives of Milan. The institute in 1929 was transformed by its director Arturo Osio into the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro.

In 1913 the Subsidy Consortium was established, led by the Bank of Italy and also participated by the Banks of Naples and Sicily, some savings banks, Monte dei Paschi di Siena and by the San Paolo Bank of Turin. In 1922 the Consortium saved Ansaldo and took control of it, and in 1923 it did the same with Banco di Roma.

In the same 1913 Francesco Saverio Nitti drew up a bill that entrusted the Bank of Italy with the supervision of other banks, but the private banks managed to avoid its approval.

In 1914 the Bank of Italy assisted the Banco di Roma, which had to devalue its capital due to losses reported in the activities in the eastern Mediterranean.

After the First World War, in 1921, it was always the Bank of Italy that led the consortium that managed the liquidation of the Italian Discount Bank and saved the Banco di Roma once again from crisis.

=== The Banking Law of 1926 ===
Even with these strong regulatory and intervention powers, the fascist state allowed the crisis of the banks that were headed by the National Credit, the Popular Party bank, to worsen.

In this way, fascism, which equally aimed at the political control of monetary issuance, intended to strike one of the electoral strengths and of the business system that orbited around the industrial policy of the Catholic world, supported by credit institutions.

With R.D.L. 812 of 6 May 1926, the Bank of Italy obtained the exclusive right to issue the currency (the royal decree of 28 April 1910, no. 204 was thus repealed, which had confirmed the prerogative also to the Bank of Naples and the Bank of Sicily).

The subsequent R.D.L. November 6, 1926 n. 1830 entrusted the Bank of Italy with the task of supervising savings banks. In 1928 the Bank was reorganized. The general manager was joined by a governor with greater powers.

Meanwhile, in 1926 the Subsidy Consortium had been transformed into a Liquidation Institute, still under the control of the central bank. In 1933 it was absorbed by the new Institute for Industrial Reconstruction, autonomous from the Bank of Italy.

While all the banks were in very bad conditions, the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro of the self-styled socialist Arturo Osio, in 1929 confiscated eleven Catholic banks, and in 1932 the Banca Agricola Italiana which had financed SNIA Viscosa di Gualino.

=== Banks and the economy of the 1930s ===
Italy in the 1930s had an agricultural economy, a small number of industrial families who relied on the subcontracting of local suppliers, formed by a myriad of small family-run businesses, not international and whose survival depended on large groups of industrialists, in turn, linked to commercial banks.

The savings from agriculture flowed into the rural coffers, the popular banks and the cooperative credit which financed the life of the provincial crafts, small businesses and construction. The job of the banks was to match the customers&#x27; short-term investment horizon with the long-term investments of large groups (Rediscount). National banks turned to local banks that had large deposits of deposits for smaller, low-risk loans.

The Cassa Depositi e Prestiti channelled postal savings in favour of local authorities, public institutions and infrastructures, which were a way of absorbing mass unemployment, through a vast program of public works.

The ideological basis of the law was that savings are a matter of national interest and must be protected by the State, a principle also enshrined in the Republican Constitution and concretized in the first place in the law establishing the interbank guarantee fund and in the policy of public bailouts. The banking legislation of 1936-1938 established a banking supervisory agency, the (IDREC), chaired by the Bank of Italy&#x27;s governor. The bank no longer had the right to give credit to individuals but only to other banks as a lender of last resort. public bailout policy. Finally, it had the power to require other banks to deposit a portion of the available funds with the same central bank; by varying the share, the Bank of Italy could operate credit tightening or enlargements.

The law established certain minimum capital and management requirements necessary to guarantee risk management, stability and operational continuity: minimum capital, minimum ratio between loans and deposits, credit limits, provisions for compulsory reserve.

=== IRI and the war ===
After the &quot;defenestration&quot; of Bonaldo Stringher, Alberto Beneduce took over and was forced to retire in 1936 after a &quot;heart attack&quot; during a meeting at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel. They conceived the duty of the banks towards the public interest of the country, as the subject who had to collect savings to lend them to entrepreneurs, as a tool for development and growth. The process was to be led by a &quot;circulation bank&quot;, which would increase the speed of circulation of money in the real economy.

The Central Bank supported the fascist monetary policy of defending the stability of the Italian lira (known as the &quot;Quota 90&quot;), through the reduction of discounts and advances, and financing the enormous expenses of wars in the 1930s and 1940s through the unlimited issuing of money (and the &quot;inflation tax&quot;, not progressive with income), as Hjalmar Schacht did in Germany under Hitler.

Operationally, the government issued and sold debt securities to finance military spending, and the military industry reinvested its government profits in the purchase of such bonds as a &quot;de facto&quot; advance on future orders, fueling a closed financial circuit. In simple terms, this was something like the ECB issuing money and lending it to private banks who keep it in their current accounts with the ECB.

This mechanism was called &quot;capital circuit&quot;. The printing of tickets and the scarcity of consumer goods created an overabundance of money that poured into bank deposits, allowing a new expansion of credit, which was directed in favour of the economic sectors themselves. given that the state paid the banks a higher interest on the BOTs than the savers. The absorption of savings into investments in fixed capital had already taken place in the First World War and industries were working with existing production capacities. Without consumption and investments, public spending by the state remained.
The war could start with a modest tax levy and inflation within the normal limits in the first months, before the black market and ration cards.

The situation followed the conflict of interest between the state entrepreneur and the state bank, albeit in the name of a higher ideological purpose.

In 1938, the government decreed the power to directly appoint presidents and vice-presidents of the board of directors of banks.

Beneduce planned to have a public bank take over the long-term credit of large companies, financed with bonds of equal duration for public works, energy, and industry. After them, the Central Bank maintained a low-profile monetary policy, consistent with the directives of fascism.

IRI operated differently, in agreement with the Italian banks and industries that supported fascism. The banks renounced exercising an option by &quot;converting&quot; the debts into shares (or a law in this regard), preferring not to enter directly into the ownership of the industrial groups.

The groups transferred the bank debts to IRI, which became the new owner in exchange for shares (at the book value, not always the same as the market value), until they held control of the property and therefore of management.

The debt of the IRI rose to nine and a half billion lire at the time, two-thirds of which were paid within the war, because they were drastically diluted by inflation which has the effect of lowering the real weight of debts until the accounting entries are cancelled. of issuance, but also to halve the purchasing power of small savers. The remaining debt was paid by 1953. The IRI in turn had debts towards the Bank of Italy for five billion lire: the State issued bonds for IRI for one and a half billion, &quot;sterilizing&quot; the debt that should have been repaid with &quot;annuity&quot; interest. accrued until 1971. The change of constitutional order and currency (exchange rate for conversion), and inflation meant that IRI (and industries) paid the Bank of Italy less than a third of the sum.

After the armistice of 8 September, the German authorities demanded the delivery of the gold reserve. 173 tons of gold were first transferred to the Milan office, and then to Fortezza. Traces of it were subsequently lost.

In the 1960s, the public debt increased and so did inflation. Governor Guido Carli made a policy of credit crunch to stop inflation, particularly in 1964. In general, the Bank of Italy played an important political role under this governorship. Other credit crunches were implemented between 1969 and 1970 due to the flight of capital abroad and in 1974 as a result of the oil crisis.

In March 1979 the governor of the Bank of Italy, Paolo Baffi, and the deputy director in charge of supervision, Mario Sarcinelli, were accused by the Rome public prosecutor of private interest in official acts and personal aiding and abetting. Sarcinelli was arrested, and released from prison only after being suspended from duties relating to surveillance, while Baffi avoided prison due to his age. In 1981 the two will be completely acquitted. Subsequently, the suspicion will emerge that the indictment was wanted by P2 to prevent the Bank of Italy from supervising Roberto Cavali Banco Ambrosiano.

=== The postwar period ===
The post-war inflation, also due to the Am-lire, was fought with the credit crunch desired by the governor Luigi Einaudi, which was obtained through the compulsory reserve on deposits. In particular, the instrument of compulsory reserves of banks at the central bank was used, introduced in 1926 but never really applied. In 1948 the governor was given the task of regulating the money supply and deciding the discount rate.

The universal banks were the ones that had gained the most from war and inflation (under the Authorization Regime of the Interministerial Credit Committee), with the greatest growth in deposits.

Along with the recovery, speculative stocks and capital flight abroad appeared. Credit limits were no longer tied to equity, as equity figures were completely distorted by inflation.

The squeeze on lending, the liquidity crisis and the Eenaudian deflation pushed operators to finance themselves by placing stocks on the market and returning capital, thus blocking the rise in prices; and by resorting to self-financing (even without distributing profits), aided by the fact that inflation had made it possible to quickly amortize fixed assets whose book value was now nominal.

During the years of the Reconstruction, governor Donato Menichella governed the issue in a gradual and balanced way: he did not implement expansionary manoeuvres to encourage growth but was careful to avoid the creation of credit crunches. In this, he was helped by the low public debt. Its monetary policy program was stability for development.

A part of the available bank savings was channelled annually to the Treasury to cover the budget deficit (in the current year), while during his tenure the public debt of the state never rose above 1% of GDP, until 1964.

In July 1981, a &quot;divorce&quot; between the State (Ministry of the Treasury) and its central bank was initiated by the decision of the then Treasury Minister Beniamino Andreatta. From that moment on, the institute was no longer required to purchase the bonds that the government was unable to place on the market, thus ceasing the monetization of the Italian public debt that it had carried out since the Second World War up to that moment. This decision was opposed by the Minister of Finance Rino Formica, who would have liked the Bank of Italy to be required to repay at least a portion of these securities, and from the summer of 1982 a series of intra-government verbal clashes between the two ministers known as the wives&#x27; quarrel, which was followed by the fall of the second Spadolini government a few months later.

The divorce between the Ministry of the Treasury and the Bank of Italy is still considered by economic doctrine as a factor of great stabilization of inflation (which went from over 20% in 1980 to less than 5% in the following years) and a central prerequisite for guarantee the full independence of the technical monetary policy body (central bank) from the choices related to fiscal policy (under the responsibility of the government), but also a factor of considerable incidence of growth of the Italian public debt.

The law of 7 February 1992 n. 82, proposed by the then Minister of the Treasury Guido Carli, clarifies that the decision on the discount rate is the exclusive competence of the governor and must no longer be agreed in concert with the Minister of the Treasury (the previous decree of the President of the Republic is modified in relation to the new law with the Presidential Decree of 18 July).

=== The euro and the 2006 reform ===
The Legislative Decree 10 March 1998 n. 43 removes the Bank of Italy from management by the Italian government, sanctioning its belonging to the European system of central banks. From this date, therefore, the quantity of currency in circulation is decided autonomously by the Central Bank. With the introduction of the Euro on 1 January 1999, the Bank thus loses the function of presiding over national monetary policy. This function has since been exercised collectively by the Governing Council of the European Central Bank, which also includes the Governor of the Bank of Italy.

On 13 June 1999 the Senate of the Republic, during the XIII Legislature, discussed bill no. 4083 &quot;Rules on the ownership of the Bank of Italy and on the criteria for appointing the Board of Governors of the Bank of Italy&quot;. This bill would like the state to acquire all the shares of the institute, but it is never approved.

On January 4, 2004, the weekly &quot;Famiglia Cristiana&quot; reports, for the first time in history, the list of participants in the capital of the Bank of Italy with the relative shares. The source is a Mediobanca Research &amp; Studies dossier, directed by the researcher Fulvio Coltorti, who, by investigating backwards on the balance sheets of banks, insurance companies and institutions, and gradually noting the shares that indicated a shareholding in the capital of the Bank of Italia managed to reconstruct a large part of the list of participants of the highest Italian financial institution.

On September 20, 2005, the list of shareholders was officially made available by the Bank of Italy; until now it was considered confidential. On December 19, 2005, after intense press campaigns and criticism of his actions in the context of the Bancopoli scandal, Governor Antonio Fazio resigned. A few days later, Mario Draghi, who took office on January 16, 2006, was appointed in his place.

The law of 28 December 2005, n. 262, as part of various measures to protect savings, introduces for the first time a term to the mandate of the governor and the members of the directorate. It also dealt with (article 19, paragraph 10) the issue of ownership of the capital of the Bank of Italy, providing for the redefinition of the Bank&#x27;s shareholding structure by means of a government regulation to be issued within three years of the law&#x27;s entry into force. This regulation should have governed the methods of transferring shares held by &quot;subjects other than the State or other public bodies&quot;. The delegation made by law 262/2005, therefore, expired without the regulation being issued, but the right to ownership of the shares of the current participants is in any case safeguarded by a provision of the Bank&#x27;s Statute. On the basis of law 262/2005, Mario Draghi becomes the first governor to have a term of six years, renewable once for a further six years.

==Missions and organization==

===Missions===
After the charge of monetary and exchange rate policies was shifted in 1998 to the European Central Bank, within the European institutional framework, the bank implements the decisions, issues euro banknotes and withdraws and destroys worn pieces.

The main function has thus become banking and financial supervision. The objective is to ensure the stability and efficiency of the system and compliance with rules and regulations; the bank pursues it through secondary legislation, controls and cooperation with governmental authorities.

Following a reform in 2005, which was prompted by takeover scandals, the bank has lost exclusive antitrust authority in the credit sector, which is now shared with the Italian Competition Authority ().

Other functions include market supervision, oversight of the payment system and provision of settlement services, State treasury service, Central Credit Register, economic analysis and institutional consultancy.

As of 2021, the Bank of Italy owned 2,451.8 tonnes of gold, the third-largest gold reserve in the world.

===Governing bodies===
The bank&#x27;s governing bodies are the General Meeting of Shareholders, the board of directors, the governor, the director general and three deputy directors-general; the last five constitute the directorate.

The general meeting takes place yearly and with the purpose of approving accounts and appointing the auditors. The board of directors has administrative powers and is chaired by the governor (or by the director-general in his absence). Following a reform in 2005, the governor lost exclusive responsibility regarding decisions of external relevance (i.e. banking and financial supervision), which has been transferred to the directorate (by majority vote). The director-general is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the bank and acts as governor when absent.

The board of auditors assesses the bank&#x27;s administration and compliance with the law, regulations and statute.

===Appointment===
The directorate&#x27;s term of office lasts six years and is renewable once. The appointment of the governor is the responsibility of the government, head of the board of directors, with the approval of the president (formally a decree of the president). The board of directors is elected by the shareholders according to the bank statute.

On 25 October 2011, Silvio Berlusconi nominated Ignazio Visco to be the bank&#x27;s new governor to replace Mario Draghi when he left to become president of the European Central Bank in November.

==Currency and coinage==


Italy has a long history of different coinage types, which spans thousands of years. Since Italy has been for centuries divided into many historic states, they all had different coinage systems, but when the country became unified in 1861, the Italian lira came into place, and was used until 2002. The term originates from &quot;libra&quot;, the largest unit of the Carolingian monetary system used in Western Europe and elsewhere from the 8th to the 20th century. 

Italian lira was introduced by the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy in 1807 at par with the French franc, and was subsequently adopted by the different states that would eventually form the Kingdom of Italy in 1861. It was subdivided into 100 &quot;centesimi&quot; (singular: &quot;centesimo&quot;), which means &quot;hundredths&quot; or &quot;cents&quot;. The lira was also the currency of the Albanian Kingdom from 1941 to 1943.

There was no standard sign or abbreviation for the Italian lira. The abbreviations &quot;Lit.&quot; (standing for &quot;Lira italiana&quot;) and L. (standing for &quot;Lira&quot;) and the signs ₤ or £ were all accepted representations of the currency. Banks and financial institutions, including the Bank of Italy, often used &quot;Lit.&quot; and this was regarded internationally as the abbreviation for the Italian lira. Handwritten documents and signs at market stalls would often use &quot;£&quot; or &quot;₤&quot;, while coins used &quot;L.&quot; Italian postage stamps mostly used the word in full but some (such as the 1975 monuments series) used &quot;L.&quot; The name of the currency could also be written in full as a prefix or a suffix (e.g. Lire 100,000 or 100,000 lire). The ISO 4217 currency code for the lira was &quot;ITL&quot;.

The Italian lira was the official unit of currency in Italy until 1 January 1999, when it was replaced by the euro (euro coins and notes were not introduced until 2002). Old lira denominated currency ceased to be legal tender on 28 February 2002. The conversion rate is 1,936.27 lire to the euro.
All lira banknotes in use immediately before the introduction of the euro, as all post WW2 coins, were still exchangeable for euros in all branches of the Bank of Italy until 29 February 2012.

==Shareholders==
Banca d&#x27;Italia had 300,000 shares with a nominal value of €25,000. Originally scattered around the banks of Italy, the shares now accumulated due to the merger of the banks since the 1990s and also a number of pension and social security institutions. The status of the bank states that a minimum of 54% of profits would go to the Italian government, and only a maximum of 6% of profits would be distributed as dividends according to share ratios. Even so, the Bank of Italy stands out among central banks in the Eurosystem as having no state ownership (the National Bank of Belgium and Bank of Greece have mixed ownership). 

As of early 2024, the 15 largest shareholders represented slightly over half of the bank&#x27;s equity, namely UniCredit (5.0 percent), (4.9 percent), (4.9 percent), (4.9 percent), Intesa Sanpaolo (4.9 percent), (3.7 percent), BPER Banca (3.3 percent), ICCREA Banca (3.1 percent), Generali Italia (3.0 percent), the National Institute for Social Security (3.0 percent), Istituto nazionale per l&#x27;assicurazione contro gli infortuni sul lavoro (3.0 percent), (3.0 percent), Cassa di Risparmio di Asti (3.0 percent), Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (2.8 percent), and Crédit Agricole Italia (2.8 percent). The remaining 49 percent were dispersed among 157 shareholders, mainly banks and banking foundations.

<doc id="3963" wikidata="Q3059480" url="?curid=3963" title="Beachcomber (pen name)">
<text>Beachcomber is a &quot;nom de plume&quot; that has been used by several journalists writing a long-running humorous column in the &quot;Daily Express&quot;. It was originated in 1917 by Major John Bernard Arbuthnot MVO as his signature on the column, titled &#x27;By the Way&#x27;. The name Beachcomber was then passed to D. B. Wyndham Lewis in 1919 and, in turn, to J. B. Morton, who wrote the column till 1975. It was later revived by William Hartston, current author of the column.

==&quot;By the Way&quot; column==
&quot;By the Way&quot; was originally a column in &quot;The Globe&quot;, consisting of unsigned humorous pieces; P. G. Wodehouse was assistant editor of the column from August 1903 and editor from August 1904 to May 1909, during which time he was assisted by Herbert Westbrook. After the &quot;Globe&quot;&#x27;s closure, it was re-established as a society news column in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; from 1917, initially written by social correspondent Major John Arbuthnot, who invented the name &quot;Beachcomber&quot;.

After Arbuthnot was promoted to deputy editor, it was taken over sometime in 1919 by Wyndham-Lewis, who reinvented it as an outlet for his wit and humour. It was then passed to Morton during 1924, though it is likely there was a period when they overlapped. Morton wrote the column until 1975; it was revived in January 1996 and continues today, written by William Hartston. The column is unsigned except by &quot;Beachcomber&quot; and it was not publicly known that Morton or Wyndham-Lewis wrote it until the 1930s. The name is mainly associated with Morton, who has been credited as an influence by Spike Milligan amongst others. Morton introduced the recurring characters and serial stories that were a major feature of the column during his 51-year run.

The format of the column was a random assortment of small paragraphs which were otherwise unconnected. These could be anything, such as:

* court reports, often involving Twelve Red-Bearded Dwarfs before Mr Justice Cocklecarrot.
* angry exchanges of letters between characters such as Florence McGurgle and her dissatisfied boarders.
* interruptions from &quot;Prodnose&quot;, representing the public, who would then be roundly cursed by the author and kicked out.
* instalments of serials that could stop, restart from earlier, be abandoned altogether or change direction abruptly without warning.
* parodies of poetry or drama, particularly of the extremely &quot;literary&quot; type such as Ibsen.
* unlikely headlines, such as &quot;SIXTY HORSES WEDGED IN A CHIMNEY&quot;, for which the copy in its entirety was &quot;The story to fit this sensational headline has not turned up yet.&quot;
* news reports from around the country.
* or just anything that the author thought funny at the time.

Morton&#x27;s other interest, France, was occasionally represented by epic tales of his rambling walks through the French countryside. These were not intended as humour.

&quot;By the Way&quot; was popular with the readership, and of course, this is one of the reasons it lasted so long. Its style and randomness could be off-putting and it is safe to say the humour could be something of an acquired taste. Oddly, one of the column&#x27;s greatest opponents was the &quot;Express&quot; newspaper&#x27;s owner, Lord Beaverbrook, who had to keep being assured the column was indeed funny. A prominent critic was George Orwell, who frequently referred to him in his essays and diaries as &quot;A Catholic Apologist&quot; and accused him of being &quot;silly-clever&quot;, in line with his criticisms of G. K. Chesterton, Hilaire Belloc, Ronald Knox and Wyndham-Lewis.

&quot;By the Way&quot; was one of the few features kept continuously running in the often seriously reduced &quot;Daily Express&quot; throughout World War II, when Morton&#x27;s lampooning of Hitler, including the British invention of bracerot to make the Nazis&#x27; trousers fall down at inopportune moments, was regarded as valuable for morale. The column appeared daily until 1965 when it was changed to weekly. It was cancelled in 1975 and revived as a daily piece in January 1996. It continues to the present day in much the same format but is now entitled &quot;Beachcomber&quot;, not &quot;By the Way&quot;.

==Recurrent characters==

*Mr. Justice Cocklecarrot: well-meaning but ineffectual High Court judge, plagued by litigation involving the twelve red-bearded dwarfs. Often appears in &quot;Private Eye&quot;.
*Mrs. Justice Cocklecarrot: Mr. Cocklecarrot&#x27;s wife. Very silent, until she observes that &quot;Wivens has fallen down a manhole&quot;. An enquiry from the judge as to which Wivens that would be elicits the response &quot;E. D. Wivens&quot;. After a worrying interval she reveals that E. D. Wivens is a cat. His Lordship observes that cats do not have initials, to which she replies, &quot;This one does&quot;.
*Tinklebury Snapdriver and Honeygander Gooseboote: two counsel. The elbow of one has a mysterious tendency to become jammed in the jaws of the other. 
*Twelve red-bearded dwarfs, with a penchant for farcical litigation. Their names &quot;appear to be&quot; Scorpion de Rooftrouser, Cleveland Zackhouse, Frums Gillygottle, Edeledel Edel, Churm Rincewind, Sophus Barkayo-Tong, Amaninter Axling, Guttergorm Guttergormpton, Badly Oronparser, Listenis Youghaupt, Molonay Tubilderborst and Farjole Merrybody. They admit that these are not genuine names, one of them stating that his real name is &quot;Bogus&quot;. (Further red-bearded dwarfs, to the number of forty-one, appear in other litigation.)
*Captain Foulenough: archetypal cad and gatecrasher who impersonates the upper class in order to wreck their social events. Educated at Narkover, a school specializing in card-playing, horse-racing and bribery. His title of &quot;Captain&quot; is probably spurious; but even if it had been a genuine military title, his use of it in civilian life, when at that time only officers who had achieved the rank of Major and above were allowed to do so, gives a subtle hint as to his nature.
*Mountfalcon Foulenough: the Captain&#x27;s priggish nephew, who brings havoc to Narkover and &quot;makes virtue seem even more horrifying than usual&quot;.
*Vita Brevis: debutante frequently plagued by, but with a certain reluctant admiration for, Captain Foulenough.
*Dr. Smart-Allick: genteel, but ludicrous and criminal, headmaster of Narkover.
*Miss Topsy Turvey: neighbouring headmistress, courted by Smart-Allick.
*Dr. Strabismus (whom God preserve) of Utrecht: eccentric scientist and inventor.
*The announcement of the annual list of Huntingdonshire Cabmen, with an enthusiastic endorsement of an arbitrary page.
*Lord Shortcake: absent-minded peer obsessed by his enormous collection of goldfish.
*Mrs. McGurgle: seaside landlady. Fearsomely British, until she decides to reinvent her house as &quot;Hôtel McGurgle et de l&#x27;Univers&quot; to attract the tourists.
*Ministry of Bubbleblowing: possible ancestor of Monty Python&#x27;s Ministry of Silly Walks.
*Charlie Suet: disastrous civil servant.
*Mimsie Slopcorner: Charlie&#x27;s on-off girlfriend, an ill-informed and irritating social activist.
*The Filthistan Trio: Ashura, Kazbulah and Rizamughan, three Persians from &quot;Thurralibad&quot;, two of whom play seesaw on a plank laid across the third. They have a series of contretemps with British bureaucracy and the artistic establishment, in which the trio generally represents the voice of reason.
*Dingi-Poos: the Tibetan Venus. She obtains desirable commercial contracts by using her charms to hoodwink visiting British envoys, principally Colonel Egham and Duncan Mince.
*Big White Carstairs: Buchanesque empire builder, with a tendency to mislay his dress trousers.
*O. Thake: naive, accident-prone Old Etonian and man-about-town.
*Lady Cabstanleigh: Society hostess.
*Stultitia: Cabstanleigh&#x27;s niece, a playwright.
*Boubou Flaring: glamorous but vacuous actress.
*Emilia Rustiguzzi: voluminous (both in bulk and in decibels) opera singer.
*Tumbelova, Serge Trouserin, Chuckusafiva: ballet dancers.
*Colin Velvette: ballet impresario.
*&quot;Thunderbolt&quot; Footle: handsome, socially celebrated boxer, who can do everything except actually fight.
*The M&#x27;Babwa of M&#x27;Gonkawiwi: African chief, who occasions great administrative problems in connection with his invitation to the coronation of King George VI.
*The Clam of Chowdah: oriental 
*Mrs. Wretch: formerly the glamorous circus performer Miss Whackaway, now wife to Colonel Wretch and &quot;horrible welfare worker&quot;.
*Roland Milk: insipid poet (possible ancestor of &quot;Private Eye&quot;″s &quot;E. J. Thribb&quot;).
*Prodnose: humourless, reasonable oaf who interrupts Beachcomber&#x27;s flights of fancy. (The name is journalistic slang for a sub-editor; the broadcaster Danny Baker has appropriated it as his Twitter name.)

==Other media==
The Will Hay film &quot;Boys Will Be Boys&quot; (1935) was set at Morton&#x27;s Narkover school.

According to Spike Milligan, the columns were an influence on the comedic style of his radio series, &quot;The Goon Show&quot;.

In 1969, Milligan based a BBC television series named &quot;The World of Beachcomber&quot; on the columns. A small selection was issued on a 1971 LP and a 2-cassette set of the series&#x27; soundtrack was made available in the late 1990s.

In 1989, BBC Radio 4 broadcast the first of three series based on Morton&#x27;s work. This featured Richard Ingrams as Beachcomber, John Wells as Prodnose, Patricia Routledge and John Sessions. The compilations prepared by Mike Barfield. Series 1 was also made available as a 2-cassette set.

<doc id="3965" wikidata="Q335047" url="?curid=3965" title="Bill Joy">
<text>William Nelson Joy (born November 8, 1954) is an American computer engineer and venture capitalist. He co-founded Sun Microsystems in 1982 along with Scott McNealy, Vinod Khosla, and Andy Bechtolsheim, and served as Chief Scientist and CTO at the company until 2003.

He played an integral role in the early development of BSD UNIX while being a graduate student at Berkeley, and he is the original author of the vi text editor. He also wrote the 2000 essay &quot;Why The Future Doesn&#x27;t Need Us&quot;, in which he expressed deep concerns over the development of modern technologies.

Joy was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering (1999) for contributions to operating systems and networking software.

==Early career==
Joy was born in the Detroit suburb of Farmington Hills, Michigan, to William Joy, a school vice-principal and counselor, and Ruth Joy. He earned a Bachelor of Science in electrical engineering from the University of Michigan and a Master of Science in electrical engineering and computer science from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1979.

While a graduate student at Berkeley, he worked for Fabry&#x27;s Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) on the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) version of the Unix operating system. He initially worked on a Pascal compiler left at Berkeley by Ken Thompson, who had been visiting the university when Joy had just started his graduate work.

He later moved on to improving the Unix kernel, and also handled BSD distributions. Some of his most notable contributions were the ex and vi editors and the C shell. Joy&#x27;s prowess as a computer programmer is legendary, with an oft-told anecdote that he wrote the vi editor in a weekend. Joy denies this assertion. A few of his other accomplishments have also been sometimes exaggerated; Eric Schmidt, CEO of Novell at the time, inaccurately reported during an interview in PBS&#x27;s documentary &quot;Nerds 2.0.1&quot; that Joy had personally rewritten the BSD kernel in a weekend. 
In 1980, he also wrote codice_1, about which Rob Pike and Brian W. Kernighan wrote that it went against Unix philosophy.

According to a &quot;Salon&quot; article, during the early 1980s, DARPA had contracted the company Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN) to add TCP/IP to Berkeley UNIX. Joy had been instructed to plug BBN&#x27;s stack into Berkeley Unix, but he refused to do so, as he had a low opinion of BBN&#x27;s TCP/IP. So, Joy wrote his own high-performance TCP/IP stack. According to John Gage:

Rob Gurwitz, who was working at BBN at the time, disputes this version of events.

==Sun Microsystems==
In 1982, after the firm had been going for six months, Joy, Sun&#x27;s sixteenth employee, was brought in with full co-founder status at Sun Microsystems. At Sun, Joy was an inspiration for the development of NFS, the SPARC microprocessors, the Java programming language, Jini/JavaSpaces, and JXTA.

In 1986, Joy was awarded a Grace Murray Hopper Award by the ACM for his work on the Berkeley UNIX Operating System.

On September 9, 2003, Sun announced Joy was leaving the company and that he &quot;is taking time to consider his next move and has no definite plans&quot;.

==Post-Sun activities==
In 1999, Joy co-founded a venture capital firm, HighBAR Ventures, with two Sun colleagues, Andy Bechtolsheim and Roy Thiele-Sardiña. In January 2005 he was named a partner in venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins. There, Joy has made several investments in green energy industries, even though he does not have any credentials in the field. He once said, &quot;My method is to look at something that seems like a good idea and assume it&#x27;s true&quot;.

In 2011, he was inducted as a Fellow of the Computer History Museum for his work on the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) Unix system and the co-founding of Sun Microsystems.

==Technology concerns==
In 2000, Joy gained notoriety with the publication of his article in &quot;Wired&quot; magazine, &quot;Why The Future Doesn&#x27;t Need Us&quot;, in which he declared, in what some have described as a &quot;neo-Luddite&quot; position, that he was convinced that growing advances in genetic engineering and nanotechnology would bring risks to humanity. He argued that intelligent robots would replace humanity, at the very least in intellectual and social dominance, in the relatively near future. He supports and promotes the idea of abandonment of GNR (genetics, nanotechnology, and robotics) technologies, instead of going into an arms race between negative uses of the technology and defense against those negative uses (good nano-machines patrolling and defending against Grey goo &quot;bad&quot; nano-machines). This stance of broad relinquishment was criticized by technologists such as technological-singularity thinker Ray Kurzweil, who instead advocates fine-grained relinquishment and ethical guidelines. Joy was also criticized by &quot;The American Spectator&quot;, which characterized Joy&#x27;s essay as a (possibly unwitting) rationale for statism.

A bar-room discussion of these technologies with Ray Kurzweil started to set Joy&#x27;s thinking along this path. He states in his essay that during the conversation, he became surprised that other serious scientists were considering such possibilities likely, and even more astounded at what he felt was a lack of consideration of the contingencies. After bringing the subject up with a few more acquaintances, he states that he was further alarmed by what he felt was that although many people considered these futures possible or probable, that very few of them shared as serious a concern for the dangers as he seemed to. This concern led to his in-depth examination of the issue and the positions of others in the scientific community on it, and eventually, to his current activities regarding it.

Despite this, he is a venture capitalist, investing in technology companies. He has also raised a specialty venture fund to address the dangers of pandemic diseases, such as the H5N1 avian influenza and biological weapons.

==Joy&#x27;s law==
===Of management===

In his 2013 book &quot;Makers&quot;, author Chris Anderson credited Joy with establishing &quot;Joy&#x27;s law&quot; based on a quip: &quot;No matter who you are, most of the smartest people work for someone else [other than you].&quot; His argument was that companies use an inefficient process by not hiring the best employees, only those they are able to hire. His &quot;law&quot; was a continuation of Friedrich Hayek&#x27;s &quot;The Use of Knowledge in Society&quot; and warned that the competition outside of a company would always have the potential to be greater than the company itself.

===Of computing===

Joy devised a formula in 1983, also called &quot;Joy&#x27;s law&quot;, stating that the peak computer speed doubles each year and thus is given by a simple function of time. Specifically,
:formula_1
in which is the peak computer speed attained during year , expressed in MIPS.

<doc id="3967" wikidata="Q249998" url="?curid=3967" title="Bandwidth (signal processing)">
<text>Bandwidth is the difference between the upper and lower frequencies in a continuous band of frequencies. It is typically measured in unit of hertz (symbol Hz).

It may refer more specifically to two subcategories: &quot;Passband bandwidth&quot; is the difference between the upper and lower cutoff frequencies of, for example, a band-pass filter, a communication channel, or a signal spectrum. &quot;Baseband bandwidth&quot; is equal to the upper cutoff frequency of a low-pass filter or baseband signal, which includes a zero frequency.

Bandwidth in hertz is a central concept in many fields, including electronics, information theory, digital communications, radio communications, signal processing, and spectroscopy and is one of the determinants of the capacity of a given communication channel.

A key characteristic of bandwidth is that any band of a given width can carry the same amount of information, regardless of where that band is located in the frequency spectrum. For example, a 3 kHz band can carry a telephone conversation whether that band is at baseband (as in a POTS telephone line) or modulated to some higher frequency. However, wide bandwidths are easier to obtain and process at higher frequencies because the is smaller.

== Overview ==

Bandwidth is a key concept in many telecommunications applications. In radio communications, for example, bandwidth is the frequency range occupied by a modulated carrier signal. An FM radio receiver&#x27;s tuner spans a limited range of frequencies. A government agency (such as the Federal Communications Commission in the United States) may apportion the regionally available bandwidth to broadcast license holders so that their signals do not mutually interfere. In this context, bandwidth is also known as channel spacing.

For other applications, there are other definitions. One definition of bandwidth, for a system, could be the range of frequencies over which the system produces a specified level of performance. A less strict and more practically useful definition will refer to the frequencies beyond which performance is degraded. In the case of frequency response, degradation could, for example, mean more than 3 dB below the maximum value or it could mean below a certain absolute value. As with any definition of the &quot;width&quot; of a function, many definitions are suitable for different purposes.

In the context of, for example, the sampling theorem and Nyquist sampling rate, bandwidth typically refers to baseband bandwidth. In the context of Nyquist symbol rate or Shannon-Hartley channel capacity for communication systems it refers to passband bandwidth.

The of a simple radar pulse is defined as the inverse of its duration. For example, a one-microsecond pulse has a Rayleigh bandwidth of one megahertz.

The is defined as the portion of a signal spectrum in the frequency domain which contains most of the energy of the signal.

== &quot;x&quot; dB bandwidth ==

In some contexts, the signal bandwidth in hertz refers to the frequency range in which the signal&#x27;s spectral density (in W/Hz or V2/Hz) is nonzero or above a small threshold value. The threshold value is often defined relative to the maximum value, and is most commonly the , that is the point where the spectral density is half its maximum value (or the spectral amplitude, in formula_1 or formula_2, is 70.7% of its maximum). This figure, with a lower threshold value, can be used in calculations of the lowest sampling rate that will satisfy the sampling theorem. 

The bandwidth is also used to denote system bandwidth, for example in filter or communication channel systems. To say that a system has a certain bandwidth means that the system can process signals with that range of frequencies, or that the system reduces the bandwidth of a white noise input to that bandwidth.

The 3 dB bandwidth of an electronic filter or communication channel is the part of the system&#x27;s frequency response that lies within 3 dB of the response at its peak, which, in the passband filter case, is typically at or near its center frequency, and in the low-pass filter is at or near its cutoff frequency. If the maximum gain is 0 dB, the 3 dB bandwidth is the frequency range where attenuation is less than 3 dB. 3 dB attenuation is also where power is half its maximum. This same &quot;half-power gain&quot; convention is also used in spectral width, and more generally for the extent of functions as full width at half maximum (FWHM).

In electronic filter design, a filter specification may require that within the filter passband, the gain is nominally 0 dB with a small variation, for example within the ±1 dB interval. In the stopband(s), the required attenuation in decibels is above a certain level, for example &gt;100 dB. In a transition band the gain is not specified. In this case, the filter bandwidth corresponds to the passband width, which in this example is the 1 dB-bandwidth. If the filter shows amplitude ripple within the passband, the &quot;x&quot; dB point refers to the point where the gain is &quot;x&quot; dB below the nominal passband gain rather than &quot;x&quot; dB below the maximum gain.

In signal processing and control theory the bandwidth is the frequency at which the closed-loop system gain drops 3 dB below peak.

In communication systems, in calculations of the Shannon–Hartley channel capacity, bandwidth refers to the 3 dB-bandwidth. In calculations of the maximum symbol rate, the Nyquist sampling rate, and maximum bit rate according to the Hartley&#x27;s law, the bandwidth refers to the frequency range within which the gain is non-zero.

The fact that in equivalent baseband models of communication systems, the signal spectrum consists of both negative and positive frequencies, can lead to confusion about bandwidth since they are sometimes referred to only by the positive half, and one will occasionally see expressions such as formula_3, where formula_4 is the total bandwidth (i.e. the maximum passband bandwidth of the carrier-modulated RF signal and the minimum passband bandwidth of the physical passband channel), and formula_5 is the positive bandwidth (the baseband bandwidth of the equivalent channel model). For instance, the baseband model of the signal would require a low-pass filter with cutoff frequency of at least formula_5 to stay intact, and the physical passband channel would require a passband filter of at least formula_4 to stay intact.

== Relative bandwidth ==
The absolute bandwidth is not always the most appropriate or useful measure of bandwidth. For instance, in the field of antennas the difficulty of constructing an antenna to meet a specified absolute bandwidth is easier at a higher frequency than at a lower frequency. For this reason, bandwidth is often quoted relative to the frequency of operation which gives a better indication of the structure and sophistication needed for the circuit or device under consideration.

There are two different measures of relative bandwidth in common use: &quot;fractional bandwidth&quot; (formula_8) and &quot;ratio bandwidth&quot; (formula_9). In the following, the absolute bandwidth is defined as follows,
formula_10 
where formula_11 and formula_12 are the upper and lower frequency limits respectively of the band in question.

=== Fractional bandwidth ===
Fractional bandwidth is defined as the absolute bandwidth divided by the center frequency (formula_13),
formula_14

The center frequency is usually defined as the arithmetic mean of the upper and lower frequencies so that,
formula_15 and
formula_16

However, the center frequency is sometimes defined as the geometric mean of the upper and lower frequencies,
formula_17 and
formula_18

While the geometric mean is more rarely used than the arithmetic mean (and the latter can be assumed if not stated explicitly) the former is considered more mathematically rigorous. It more properly reflects the logarithmic relationship of fractional bandwidth with increasing frequency. For narrowband applications, there is only marginal difference between the two definitions. The geometric mean version is inconsequentially larger. For wideband applications they diverge substantially with the arithmetic mean version approaching 2 in the limit and the geometric mean version approaching infinity.

Fractional bandwidth is sometimes expressed as a percentage of the center frequency (percent bandwidth, formula_19),
formula_20

=== Ratio bandwidth ===

Ratio bandwidth is defined as the ratio of the upper and lower limits of the band,
formula_21

Ratio bandwidth may be notated as formula_22. The relationship between ratio bandwidth and fractional bandwidth is given by,
formula_23 and
formula_24

Percent bandwidth is a less meaningful measure in wideband applications. A percent bandwidth of 100% corresponds to a ratio bandwidth of 3:1. All higher ratios up to infinity are compressed into the range 100–200%.

Ratio bandwidth is often expressed in octaves (i.e., as a frequency level) for wideband applications. An octave is a frequency ratio of 2:1 leading to this expression for the number of octaves, formula_25

== Noise equivalent bandwidth ==


The noise equivalent bandwidth (or equivalent noise bandwidth (enbw)) of a system of frequency response formula_26 is the bandwidth of an ideal filter with rectangular frequency response centered on the system&#x27;s central frequency that produces the same average power outgoing formula_26 when both systems are excited with a white noise source.
The value of the noise equivalent bandwidth depends on the ideal filter reference gain used. Typically, this gain equals formula_28 at its center frequency, but it can also equal the peak value of formula_28. 

The noise equivalent bandwidth formula_30 can be calculated in the frequency domain using formula_26 or in the time domain by exploiting the Parseval&#x27;s theorem with the system impulse response formula_32. If formula_26 is a lowpass system with zero central frequency and the filter reference gain is referred to this frequency, then: 

formula_34

The same expression can be applied to bandpass systems by substituting the equivalent baseband frequency response for formula_26. 

The noise equivalent bandwidth is widely used to simplify the analysis of telecommunication systems in the presence of noise.

== Photonics ==

In photonics, the term &quot;bandwidth&quot; carries a variety of meanings:
*the bandwidth of the output of some light source, e.g., an ASE source or a laser; the bandwidth of ultrashort optical pulses can be particularly large
*the width of the frequency range that can be transmitted by some element, e.g. an optical fiber
*the gain bandwidth of an optical amplifier
*the width of the range of some other phenomenon, e.g., a reflection, the phase matching of a nonlinear process, or some resonance
*the maximum modulation frequency (or range of modulation frequencies) of an optical modulator
*the range of frequencies in which some measurement apparatus (e.g., a power meter) can operate
*the data rate (e.g., in Gbit/s) achieved in an optical communication system; see bandwidth (computing).

A related concept is the spectral linewidth of the radiation emitted by excited atoms.

<text>In Buddhism, a bodhisattva ( ; ; ) or bodhisatva is a person who is on the path towards bodhi (&#x27;awakening&#x27;) or Buddhahood.

In the Early Buddhist schools, as well as modern Theravāda Buddhism, bodhisattva (or bodhisatta) refers to someone who has made a resolution to become a Buddha and has also received a confirmation or prediction from a living Buddha that this will come to pass.

In Mahāyāna Buddhism, a bodhisattva refers to anyone who has generated &quot;bodhicitta&quot;, a spontaneous wish and compassionate mind to attain Buddhahood for the benefit of all sentient beings. Mahayana bodhisattvas are spiritually heroic persons that work to attain awakening and are driven by a great compassion (&quot;mahākaruṇā&quot;). These beings are exemplified by important spiritual qualities such as the &quot;four divine abodes&quot; (&quot;brahmavihāras&quot;) of loving-kindness (&quot;maitrī&quot;), compassion (&quot;karuṇā&quot;), empathetic joy (&quot;muditā&quot;) and equanimity (&quot;upekṣā&quot;), as well as the various bodhisattva &quot;perfections&quot; (&quot;pāramitās&quot;) which include &quot;prajñāpāramitā&quot; (&quot;transcendent knowledge&quot; or &quot;perfection of wisdom&quot;) and skillful means (&quot;upāya&quot;).

In Theravāda Buddhism, the bodhisattva is mainly seen as an exceptional and rare individual. Only a few select individuals are ultimately able to become bodhisattvas, such as Maitreya. Mahāyāna Buddhism generally understands the bodhisattva path as being open to everyone, and Mahāyāna Buddhists encourage all individuals to become bodhisattvas. Spiritually advanced bodhisattvas such as Avalokiteshvara, Maitreya, and Manjushri are also widely venerated across the Mahāyāna Buddhist world and are believed to possess great magical power, which they employ to help all living beings.

== Early Buddhism ==


In pre-sectarian Buddhism, the term &quot;bodhisatta&quot; is used in the early texts to refer to Gautama Buddha in his previous lives and as a young man in his last life, when he was working towards liberation. In the early Buddhist discourses, the Buddha regularly uses the phrase &quot;when I was an unawakened Bodhisatta&quot; to describe his experiences before his attainment of awakening. The early texts which discuss the period before the Buddha&#x27;s awakening mainly focus on his spiritual development. According to Bhikkhu Analayo, most of these passages focus on three main themes: &quot;the bodhisattva&#x27;s overcoming of unwholesome states of mind, his development of mental tranquillity, and the growth of his insight.&quot;
Other early sources like the &quot;Acchariyabbhutadhamma-sutta&quot; (MN 123, and its Chinese parallel in Madhyama-āgama 32) discuss the marvelous qualities of the bodhisattva Gautama in his previous life in Tuṣita heaven. The Pali text focuses on how the bodhisattva was endowed with mindfulness and clear comprehension while living in Tuṣita, while the Chinese source states that his lifespan, appearance, and glory was greater than all the devas (gods). These sources also discuss various miracles which accompanied the bodhisattva&#x27;s conception and birth, most famously, his taking seven steps and proclaiming that this was his last life. The Chinese source (titled &quot;Discourse on Marvellous Qualities&quot;) also states that while living as a monk under the Buddha Kāśyapa he &quot;made his initial vow to [realize] Buddhahood [while] practicing the holy life.&quot;

Another early source that discusses the qualities of bodhisattvas is the &quot;Mahāpadāna sutta.&quot; This text discusses bodhisattva qualities in the context of six previous Buddhas who lived long ago, such as Buddha Vipaśyī. Yet another important element of the bodhisattva doctrine, the a prediction of someone&#x27;s future Buddhahood, is found in another Chinese early Buddhist text, the &quot;Discourse on an Explanation about the Past&quot; (MĀ 66). In this discourse, a monk named Maitreya aspires to become a Buddha in the future and the Buddha then predicts that Maitreya will become a Buddha in the future. Other discourses found in the &quot; Ekottarika-āgama&quot; present the &quot;bodhisattva Maitreya&quot; as an example figure (EĀ 20.6 and EĀ 42.6) and one sutra in this collection also discuss how the Buddha taught the bodhisattva path of the six perfections to Maitreya (EĀ 27.5).

&#x27;Bodhisatta&#x27; may also connote a being who is &quot;bound for enlightenment&quot;, in other words, a person whose aim is to become fully enlightened. In the Pāli canon, the Bodhisatta (bodhisattva) is also described as someone who is still subject to birth, illness, death, sorrow, defilement, and delusion. According to the Theravāda monk Bhikkhu Bodhi, while all the Buddhist traditions agree that to attain Buddhahood, one must &quot;make a deliberate resolution&quot; and fulfill the spiritual perfections (pāramīs or pāramitās) as a bodhisattva, the actual bodhisattva path is not taught in the earliest strata of Buddhist texts such as the Pali Nikayas (and their counterparts such as the Chinese Āgamas) which instead focus on the ideal of the arahant.

The oldest known story about how Gautama Buddha becomes a bodhisattva is the story of his encounter with the previous Buddha, Dīpankara. During this encounter, a previous incarnation of Gautama, variously named Sumedha, Megha, or Sumati offers five blue lotuses and spreads out his hair or entire body for Dīpankara to walk on, resolving to one day become a Buddha. Dīpankara then confirms that they will attain Buddhahood. Early Buddhist authors saw this story as indicating that the making of a resolution (&quot;abhinīhāra&quot;) in the presence of a living Buddha and his prediction/confirmation (&quot;vyākaraṇa&quot;) of one&#x27;s future Buddhahood was necessary to become a bodhisattva. According to Drewes, &quot;all known models of the path to Buddhahood developed from this basic understanding.&quot;

Stories and teachings on the bodhisattva ideal are found in the various Jataka tale sources, which mainly focus on stories of the past lives of the Sakyamuni. Among the non-Mahayana Nikaya schools, the Jataka literature was likely the main genre that contained bodhisattva teachings. These stories had certainly become an important part of popular Buddhism by the time of the carving of the Bharhut Stupa railings (c. 125–100 BCE), which contain depictions of around thirty Jataka tales. Thus, it is possible that the bodhisattva ideal was popularized through the telling of Jatakas. Jataka tales contain numerous stories which focus on the past life deeds of Sakyamuni when he was a bodhisattva. These deeds generally express bodhisattva qualities and practices (such as compassion, the six perfections, and supernatural power) in dramatic ways, and include numerous acts of self-sacrifice.
Apart from Jataka stories related to Sakyamuni, the idea that Metteya (Maitreya), who currently resides in Tuṣita, would become the future Buddha and that this had been predicted by the Buddha Sakyamuni was also an early doctrine related to the bodhisattva ideal. It first appears in the &quot;Cakkavattisihanadasutta&quot;. According to A.L. Basham, it is also possible that some of the Ashokan edicts reveal knowledge of the bodhisattva ideal. Basham even argues that Ashoka may have considered himself a bodhisattva, as one edict states that he &quot;set out for sambodhi.&quot;

== Nikāya schools ==

By the time that the Buddhist tradition had developed into various competing sects, the idea of the bodhisattva vehicle (Sanskrit: &quot;bodhisattvayana&quot;) as a distinct (and superior) path from that of the arhat and solitary buddha was widespread among all the major non-Mahayana Buddhist traditions or Nikaya schools, including Theravāda, Sarvāstivāda and Mahāsāṃghika. The doctrine is found, for example, in 2nd century CE sources like the &quot;Avadānaśataka&quot; and the &quot;Divyāvadāna.&quot; The bodhisattvayana was referred by other names such as &quot;vehicle of the perfections&quot; (&quot;pāramitāyāna&quot;), &quot;bodhisatva dharma&quot;, &quot;bodhisatva training&quot;, and &quot;vehicle of perfect Buddhahood&quot;.

According to various sources, some of the Nikaya schools (such as the Dharmaguptaka and some of the Mahasamghika sects) transmitted a collection of texts on bodhisattvas alongside the Tripitaka, which they termed &quot;Bodhisattva Piṭaka&quot; or &quot;Vaipulya (Extensive) Piṭaka&quot;. None of these have survived. Dar Hayal attributes the historical development of the bodhisattva ideal to &quot;the growth of bhakti (devotion, faith, love) and the idealisation and spiritualisation of the Buddha.&quot;

The North Indian Sarvāstivāda school held it took Gautama three &quot;incalculable aeons&quot; (&quot;asaṃkhyeyas&quot;) and ninety one aeons (&quot;kalpas&quot;) to become a Buddha after his resolution (&quot;praṇidhāna&quot;) in front of a past Buddha. During the first incalculable aeon he is said to have encountered and served 75,000 Buddhas, and 76,000 in the second, after which he received his first prediction (&quot;vyākaraṇa&quot;) of future Buddhahood from Dīpankara, meaning that he could no longer fall back from the path to Buddhahood. For Sarvāstivāda, the first two incalculable aeons is a period of time in which a bodhisattva may still fall away and regress from the path. At the end of the second incalculable aeon, they encounter a buddha and receive their prediction, at which point they are certain to achieve Buddhahood.

Thus, the presence of a living Buddha is also necessary for Sarvāstivāda. The &quot;Mahāvibhāṣā&quot; explains that its discussion of the bodhisattva path is partly meant &quot;to stop those who are in fact not bodhisattvas from giving rise to the self-conceit that they are.&quot; However, for Sarvāstivāda, one is not technically a bodhisattva until the end of the third incalculable aeon, after which one begins to perform the actions which lead to the manifestation of the marks of a great person.

The &quot;Mahāvastu&quot; of the Mahāsāṃghika-Lokottaravādins presents various ideas regarding the school&#x27;s conception of the bodhisattva ideal. According to this text, bodhisattva Gautama had already reached a level of dispassion at the time of Buddha Dīpaṃkara many aeons ago and he is also said to have attained the perfection of wisdom countless aeons ago.

The &quot;Mahāvastu&quot; also presents four stages or courses (&quot;caryās)&quot; of the bodhisattva path without giving specific time frames (though it&#x27;s said to take various incalculable aeons). This set of four phases of the path is also found in other sources, including the Gandhari “&quot;Many-Buddhas Sūtra&quot;” (*&quot;Bahubudha gasutra&quot;) and the Chinese &quot;Fó běnxíng jí jīng&quot; (佛本行 集經, Taisho vol. 3, no. 190, pp. 669a1–672a11).

The four &quot;caryās&quot; (Gandhari: &quot;caria&quot;) are the following:

# Natural (Sanskrit: &quot;prakṛti&quot;-&quot;caryā,&quot; Gandhari: &quot;pragidi&quot;, Chinese: 自性行 zì xìng xíng), one first plants the roots of merit in front of a Buddha to attain Buddhahood.
# Resolution (&quot;praṇidhāna-caryā,&quot; G&quot;: praṇisi&quot;, C: 願性行 yuàn xìng xíng), one makes their first resolution to attain Buddhahood in the presence of a Buddha.
# Continuing (&quot;anuloma-caryā&quot;, C: 順性行 shùn xìng xíng) or &quot;development&quot; (&quot;vivartana&quot;, G: &quot;vivaṭaṇa&quot;), in which one continues to practice until one meets a Buddha who confirms one&#x27;s future Buddhahood.
# Irreversible (&quot;anivartana-caryā&quot;, C: 轉性行 zhuǎn xìng xíng) or “course of purity” (G: śukracaria), this is the stage at which one cannot fall back and is assured of future Buddhahood.

== Theravāda ==

The bodhisattva ideal is also found in southern Buddhist sources, like the Theravāda school&#x27;s &quot;Buddhavaṃsa&quot; (1st-2nd century BCE), which explains how Gautama, after making a resolution (&quot;abhinīhāra&quot;) and receiving his prediction (&quot;vyākaraṇa&quot;) of future Buddhahood from past Buddha Dīpaṃkara, he became certain (&quot;dhuva&quot;) to attain Buddhahood. Gautama then took four incalculable aeons and a hundred thousand, shorter &quot;kalpas&quot; (aeons) to reach Buddhahood. Several sources in the Pali Canon depict the idea that there are multiple Buddhas and that there will be many future Buddhas, all of which must train as bodhisattas. Non-canonical Theravada Jataka literature also teaches about bodhisattvas and the bodhisattva path. The worship of bodhisattvas like Metteya, Saman and Natha (Avalokiteśvara) can also be found in Theravada Buddhism.

By the time of the great scholar Buddhaghosa (5th-century CE), orthodox Theravāda held the standard Indian Buddhist view that there were three main spiritual paths within Buddhism: the way of the Buddhas (&quot;buddhayāna&quot;) i.e. the bodhisatta path; the way of the individual Buddhas (&quot;paccekabuddhayāna&quot;); and the way of the disciples (&quot;sāvakayāna&quot;).

The Sri Lankan commentator Dhammapāla (6th century CE) wrote a commentary on the &quot;Cariyāpiṭaka&quot;, a text which focuses on the bodhisattva path and on the ten perfections of a bodhisatta. Dhammapāla&#x27;s commentary notes that to become a bodhisattva one must make a valid resolution in front of a living Buddha. The Buddha then must provide a prediction (&quot;vyākaraṇa&quot;) which confirms that one is irreversible (&quot;anivattana&quot;) from the attainment of Buddhahood. The &quot;Nidānakathā&quot;, as well as the &quot;Buddhavaṃsa&quot; and &quot;Cariyāpiṭaka&quot; commentaries makes this explicit by stating that one cannot use a substitute (such as a Bodhi tree, Buddha statue or Stupa) for the presence of a living Buddha, since only a Buddha has the knowledge for making a reliable prediction. This is the generally accepted view maintained in orthodox Theravada today.

According to Theravāda commentators like Dhammapāla as well as the &quot;Suttanipāta&quot; commentary, there are three types of bodhisattvas:

* Bodhisattvas &quot;preponderant in wisdom&quot; (&quot;paññādhika&quot;), like Gautama, reach Buddhahood in four incalculable aeons (asaṃkheyyas) and a hundred thousand kalpas.
* Bodhisattvas &quot;preponderant in faith&quot; (&quot;saddhādhika&quot;) take twice as long as &quot;paññādhika&quot; bodhisattvas
* Bodhisattvas &quot;preponderant in vigor&quot; (&quot;vīriyādhika&quot;) take four times as long as &quot;paññādhika&quot; bodhisattvas

According to modern Theravada authors, meeting a Buddha is needed to truly make someone a bodhisattva because any other resolution to attain Buddhahood may easily be forgotten or abandoned during the aeons ahead. The Burmese monk Ledi Sayadaw (1846–1923) explains that though it is easy to make vows for future Buddhahood by oneself, it is very difficult to maintain the necessary conduct and views during periods when the Dharma has disappeared from the world. One will easily fall back during such periods and this is why one is not truly a full bodhisattva until one receives recognition from a living Buddha.

Because of this, it was and remains a common practice in Theravada to attempt to establish the necessary conditions to meet the future Buddha Maitreya and thus receive a prediction from him. Medieval Theravada literature and inscriptions report the aspirations of monks, kings and ministers to meet Maitreya for this purpose. Modern figures such as Anagarika Dharmapala (1864–1933), and U Nu (1907–1995) both sought to receive a prediction from a Buddha in the future and believed meritorious actions done for the good of Buddhism would help in their endeavor to become bodhisattvas in the future.

Over time the term came to be applied to other figures besides Gautama Buddha in Theravada lands, possibly due to the influence of Mahayana. The Theravada Abhayagiri tradition of Sri Lanka practiced Mahayana Buddhism and was very influential until the 12th century. Kings of Sri Lanka were often described as bodhisattvas, starting at least as early as Sirisanghabodhi (r. 247–249), who was renowned for his compassion, took vows for the welfare of the citizens, and was regarded as a mahāsatta (Sanskrit: &quot;mahāsattva&quot;), an epithet used almost exclusively in Mahayana Buddhism. Many other Sri Lankan kings from the 3rd until the 15th century were also described as bodhisattas and their royal duties were sometimes clearly associated with the practice of the ten pāramitās. In some cases, they explicitly claimed to have received predictions of Buddhahood in past lives.

Popular Buddhist figures have also been seen as bodhisattvas in Theravada Buddhist lands. Shanta Ratnayaka notes that Anagarika Dharmapala, Asarapasarana Saranarikara Sangharaja, and Hikkaduwe Sri Sumamgala &quot;are often called bodhisattvas&quot;. Buddhaghosa was also traditionally considered to be a reincarnation of Maitreya. Paul Williams writes that some modern Theravada meditation masters in Thailand are popularly regarded as bodhisattvas. Various modern figures of esoteric Theravada traditions (such as the weizzās of Burma) have also claimed to be bodhisattvas.

Theravada bhikkhu and scholar Walpola Rahula writes that the bodhisattva ideal has traditionally been held to be higher than the state of a &quot;śrāvaka&quot; not only in Mahayana but also in Theravada. Rahula writes &quot;the fact is that both the Theravada and the Mahayana unanimously accept the Bodhisattva ideal as the highest...Although the Theravada holds that anybody can be a Bodhisattva, it does not stipulate or insist that all must be Bodhisattva which is considered not practical.&quot; He also quotes the 10th century king of Sri Lanka, Mahinda IV (956–972 CE), who had the words inscribed &quot;none but the bodhisattvas will become kings of a prosperous Lanka,&quot; among other examples.

Jeffrey Samuels echoes this perspective, noting that while in Mahayana Buddhism the bodhisattva path is held to be universal and for everyone, in Theravada it is &quot;reserved for and appropriated by certain exceptional people.&quot;

==Mahāyāna==
===Early Mahāyāna===
Mahāyāna Buddhism (often also called &quot;Bodhisattvayāna&quot;, &quot;Bodhisattva Vehicle&quot;) is based principally upon the path of a bodhisattva. This path was seen as higher and nobler than becoming an arhat or a solitary Buddha. Hayal notes that Sanskrit sources generally depict the bodhisattva path as reaching a higher goal (i.e. &quot;anuttara-samyak-sambodhi&quot;) than the goal of the path of the &quot;disciples&quot; (śrāvakas), which is the nirvana attained by arhats. For example, the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot; states:&quot;To the sravakas, he preached the doctrine which is associated with the four Noble Truths and leads to Dependent Origination. It aims at transcending birth, old age, disease, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress of mind and weariness; and it ends in nirvana. But, to the great being, the bodhisattva, he preached the doctrine, which is associated with the six perfections and which ends in the Knowledge of the Omniscient One after the attainment of the supreme and perfect bodhi.&quot;According to Peter Skilling, the Mahayana movement began when &quot;at an uncertain point, let us say in the first century BCE, groups of monks, nuns, and lay-followers began to devote themselves exclusively to the Bodhisatva vehicle.&quot; These Mahayanists universalized the bodhisattvayana as a path which was open to everyone and which was taught for all beings to follow. This was in contrast to the Nikaya schools, which held that the bodhisattva path was only for a rare set of individuals. Indian Mahayanists preserved and promoted a set of texts called Vaipulya (&quot;Extensive&quot;) sutras (later called Mahayana sutras).

Mahayana sources like the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot; also claim that arhats that have reached nirvana have not truly finished their spiritual quest, for they still have not attained the superior goal of sambodhi (Buddhahood) and thus must continue to strive until they reach this goal.

The &quot;&quot;, one of the earliest known Mahayana texts, contains a simple and brief definition for the term &quot;bodhisattva&quot;, which is also the earliest known Mahāyāna definition. This definition is given as the following: &quot;Because he has bodhi as his aim, a bodhisattva-mahāsattva is so called.&quot;

Mahayana sutras also depict the bodhisattva as a being which, because they want to reach Buddhahood for the sake of all beings, is more loving and compassionate than the sravaka (who only wishes to end their own suffering). Thus, another major difference between the bodhisattva and the arhat is that the bodhisattva practices the path for the good of others (&quot;par-ārtha&quot;), due to their bodhicitta, while the sravakas do so for their own good (&quot;sv-ārtha&quot;) and thus, do not have bodhicitta (which is compassionately focused on others).

Mahayana bodhisattvas were not just abstract models for Buddhist practice, but also developed as distinct figures which were venerated by Indian Buddhists. These included figures like Manjushri and Avalokiteshvara, which are personifications of the basic virtues of wisdom and compassion respectively and are the two most important bodhisattvas in Mahayana. The development of bodhisattva devotion parallels the development of the Hindu bhakti movement. Indeed, Dayal sees the development of Indian bodhisattva cults as a Buddhist reaction to the growth of bhakti centered religion in India which helped to popularize and reinvigorate Indian Buddhism.

Some Mahayana sutras promoted another revolutionary doctrinal turn, claiming that the three vehicles of the &quot;Śrāvakayāna, Pratyekabuddhayāna&quot; and the &quot;Bodhisattvayāna&quot; were really just one vehicle (&quot;ekayana&quot;). This is most famously promoted in the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; which claims that the very idea of three separate vehicles is just an &quot;upaya&quot;, a skillful device invented by the Buddha to get beings of various abilities on the path. But ultimately, it will be revealed to them that there is only one vehicle, the &quot;ekayana&quot;, which ends in Buddhahood.

=== Mature scholastic Mahāyāna ===

Classical Indian mahayanists held that the only sutras which teach the bodhisattva vehicle are the Mahayana sutras. Thus, Nagarjuna writes &quot;the subjects based on the deeds of Bodhisattvas were not mentioned in [non-Mahāyāna] sūtras.&quot; They also held that the bodhisattva path was superior to the śrāvaka vehicle and so the bodhisattva vehicle is the &quot;great vehicle&quot; (mahayana) due to its greater aspiration to save others, while the śrāvaka vehicle is the &quot;small&quot; or &quot;inferior&quot; vehicle (hinayana). Thus, Asanga argues in his &quot;Mahāyānasūtrālaṃkāra&quot; that the two vehicles differ in numerous ways, such as intention, teaching, employment (i.e., means), support, and the time that it takes to reach the goal.

Over time, Mahayana Buddhists developed mature systematized doctrines about the bodhisattva. The authors of the various Madhyamaka treatises often presented the view of the &quot;ekayana&quot;, and thus held that all beings can become bodhisattvas. The texts and sutras associated with the Yogacara school developed a different theory of three separate &quot;gotras&quot; (families, lineages), that inherently predisposed a person to either the vehicle of the &quot;arhat&quot;, &quot;pratyekabuddha&quot; or &quot;samyak-saṃbuddha&quot; (fully self-awakened one). For the yogacarins then, only some beings (those who have the &quot;bodhisattva lineage&quot;) can enter the bodhisattva path. In East Asian Buddhism, the view of the one vehicle (&quot;ekayana&quot;) which holds that all Buddhist teachings are really part of a single path, is the standard view.

The term bodhisattva was also used in a broader sense by later authors. According to the eighth-century Mahāyāna philosopher Haribhadra, the term &quot;bodhisattva&quot; can refer to those who follow any of the three vehicles, since all are working towards &quot;bodhi&quot;. Therefore, the specific term for a Mahāyāna bodhisattva is a &quot;mahāsattva&quot; (great being) &quot;bodhisattva&quot;. According to Atiśa&#x27;s 11th century &quot;Bodhipathapradīpa,&quot; the central defining feature of a Mahāyāna bodhisattva is the universal aspiration to end suffering for all sentient beings, which is termed &quot;bodhicitta&quot; (the mind set on awakening).

The bodhisattva doctrine went through a significant transformation during the development of Buddhist tantra, also known as Vajrayana. This movement developed new ideas and texts which introduced new bodhisattvas and re-interpreted old ones in new forms, developed in elaborate mandalas for them and introduced new practices which made use of mantras, mudras and other tantric elements.

=== Entering the bodhisattva path ===
According to David Drewes, &quot;Mahayana sutras unanimously depict the path beginning with the first arising of the thought of becoming a Buddha (&quot;prathamacittotpāda&quot;), or the initial arising of &quot;bodhicitta&quot;, typically aeons before one first receives a Buddha&#x27;s prediction, and apply the term bodhisattva from this point.&quot; The &quot;Ten Stages Sutra&quot;, for example, explains that the arising of bodhicitta is the first step in the bodhisattva&#x27;s career. Thus, the arising of bodhicitta, the compassionate mind aimed at awakening for the sake of all beings, is a central defining element of the bodhisattva path.

Another key element of the bodhisattva path is the concept of a bodhisattva&#x27;s &quot;praṇidhāna&quot; - which can mean a resolution, resolve, vow, prayer, wish, aspiration and determination. This more general idea of an earnest wish or solemn resolve which is closely connected with bodhicitta (and is the cause and result of bodhicitta) eventually developed into the idea that bodhisattvas take certain formulaic &quot;bodhisattva vows.&quot; One of the earliest of these formulas is found in the &quot;&quot; and states:We having crossed (the stream of samsara), may we help living beings to cross! We being liberated, may we liberate others! We being comforted, may we comfort others! We being finally released, may we release others! Other sutras contain longer and more complex formulas, such as the ten vows found in the &quot;Ten Stages Sutra.&quot;

Mahayana sources also discuss the importance of a Buddha&#x27;s prediction (&quot;vyākaraṇa&quot;) of a bodhisattva&#x27;s future Buddhahood. This is seen as an important step along the bodhisattva path.

Later Mahayana Buddhists also developed specific rituals and devotional acts for which helped to develop various preliminary qualities, such as faith, worship, prayer, and confession, that lead to the arising of &quot;bodhicitta.&quot; These elements, which constitute a kind of preliminary preparation for bodhicitta, are found in the &quot;seven part worship&quot; (&quot;saptāṅgavidhi, saptāṇgapūjā&quot; or &quot;saptavidhā anuttarapūjā&quot;). This ritual form is visible in the works of Shantideva (8th century) and includes:
* &quot;Vandana&quot; (obeisance, bowing down)
* &quot;Puja&quot; (worship of the Buddhas)
* &quot;Sarana-gamana&quot; (going for refuge)
* &quot;Papadesana&quot; (confession of bad deeds)
* &quot;Punyanumodana&quot; (rejoicing in merit of the good deeds of oneself and others) 
* &quot;Adhyesana&quot; (prayer, entreaty) and &quot;yacana&quot; (supplication) – request to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas to continue preaching Dharma
* &quot;Atmabhavadi-parityagah&quot; (surrender) and &quot;pariṇāmanā&quot; (the transfer of one&#x27;s Merit to the welfare of others)

After these preliminaries have been accomplished, then the aspirant is seen as being ready to give rise to bodhicitta, often through the recitation of a bodhisattva vow. Contemporary Mahāyāna Buddhism encourages everyone to give rise to bodhicitta and ceremonially take bodhisattva vows. With these vows and precepts, one makes the promise to work for the complete enlightenment of all sentient beings by practicing the transcendent virtues or paramitas.

In Mahāyāna, bodhisattvas are often not Buddhist monks and are former lay practitioners.

=== Bodhisattva conduct (caryā) ===
After a being has entered the path by giving rise to bodhicitta, they must make effort in the practice or conduct (&quot;caryā&quot;) of the bodhisattvas, which includes all the duties, virtues and practices that bodhisattvas must accomplish to attain Buddhahood. An important early Mahayana source for the practice of the bodhisattva is the &quot;Bodhisattvapiṭaka sūtra,&quot; a major sutra found in the &quot;Mahāratnakūṭa&quot; collection which was widely cited by various sources. According to Ulrich Pagel, this text is &quot;one of the longest works on the bodhisattva in Mahayana literature&quot; and thus provides extensive information on the topic bodhisattva training, especially the perfections (&quot;pāramitā&quot;). Pagel also argues that this text was quite influential on later Mahayana writings which discuss the bodhisattva and thus was &quot;of fundamental importance to the evolution of the bodhisattva doctrine.&quot; Other sutras in the &quot;Mahāratnakūṭa&quot; collection are also important sources for the bodhisattva path.

According to Pagel, the basic outline of the bodhisattva practice in the &quot;Bodhisattvapiṭaka&quot; is outlined in a passage which states &quot;the path to enlightenment comprises benevolence towards all sentient beings, striving after the perfections and compliance with the means of conversion.&quot; This path begins with contemplating the failures of samsara, developing faith in the Buddha, giving rise to bodhicitta and practicing the four immesurables. It then proceeds through all six perfections and finally discusses the four means of converting sentient beings (&quot;saṃgrahavastu&quot;). The path is presented through prose exposition, mnemonic lists (&quot;matrka&quot;) and also through Jataka narratives. Using this general framework, the &quot;Bodhisattvapiṭaka&quot; incorporates discussions related to other practices including super knowledge (&quot;abhijñā&quot;), learning, &#x27;skill&#x27; (&quot;kauśalya&quot;), accumulation of merit (&quot;puṇyasaṃbhāra&quot;), the thirty-seven factors of awakening (&quot;bodhipakṣadharmas&quot;), perfect mental quietude (&quot;śamatha&quot;) and insight (&quot;vipaśyanā&quot;).

Later Mahayana treatises (&quot;śāstras&quot;) like the &quot;Bodhisattvabhumi&quot; and the &quot;Mahāyānasūtrālamkāra&quot; provide the following schema of bodhisattva practices:

* &quot;Bodhipakṣa-caryā&quot;, the practice of the 37 &quot;bodhipakṣadharmas&quot; (the principles conducive to bodhi) which are: the four applications of mindfulness, the four right efforts, the four bases of spiritual power, the five spiritual faculties, the five strengths, the seven factors of awakening and the noble eightfold path.
* &quot;Abhijñā-caryā&quot;, the practice of the super-knowledges (which are mainly developed in order to convert, help and guide others).
* &quot;Pāramitā-caryā,&quot; the practice of the perfections, which are: Dāna (generosity), Śīla (virtue, ethics), Kṣānti (patient endurance), Vīrya (heroic energy), Dhyāna (meditation), Prajñā (wisdom), Upāya (skillful means), Praṇidhāna (vow, resolve), Bala (spiritual power), and Jñāna (knowledge).
* &quot;Sattvaparipāka-caryā&quot;, the practice of maturing the living beings, i.e. preaching and teaching others.

The first six perfections (&quot;pāramitās&quot;) are the most significant and popular set of bodhisattva virtues and thus they serve as a central framework for bodhisattva practice. They are the most widely taught and commented upon virtues throughout the history of Mahayana Buddhist literature and feature prominently in major Sanskrit sources such as the &quot;Bodhisattvabhumi&quot;, the &quot;Mahāyānasūtrālamkāra,&quot; the &quot;King of Samadhis Sutra&quot; and the &quot;Ten Stages Sutra&quot;. They are extolled and praised by these sources as &quot;the great oceans of all the bright virtues and auspicious principles&quot; (&quot;Bodhisattvabhumi&quot;) and &quot;the Teacher, the Way and the Light...the Refuge and the Shelter, the Support and the Sanctuary&quot; (&quot;Aṣṭasāhasrikā&quot;).

While many Mahayana sources discuss the bodhisattva&#x27;s training in ethical discipline (&quot;śīla&quot;) in classic Buddhist terms, over time, there also developed specific sets of ethical precepts for bodhisattvas (Skt. &quot;bodhisattva-śīla&quot;). These various sets of precepts are usually taken by bodhisattva aspirants (lay and ordained monastics) along with classic Buddhist pratimoksha precepts. However, in some Japanese Buddhist traditions, monastics rely solely on the bodhisattva precepts.

The perfection of wisdom (&quot;prajñāpāramitā&quot;) is generally seen as the most important and primary of the perfections, without which all the others fall short. Thus, the &quot;Madhyamakavatara&quot; (6:2) states that wisdom leads the other perfections as a man with eyes leads the blind. This perfect or transcendent wisdom has various qualities, such as being non-attached (&quot;asakti&quot;), non-conceptual and non-dual (&quot;advaya&quot;) and signless (&quot;animitta&quot;). It is generally understood as a kind of insight into the true nature of all phenomena (&quot;dharmas&quot;) which in Mahayana sutras is widely described as emptiness (&quot;shunyatā&quot;).

Another key virtue which the bodhisattva must develop is great compassion (&quot;mahā-karuṇā&quot;), a vast sense of care aimed at ending the suffering of all sentient beings. This great compassion is the ethical foundation of the bodhisattva, and it is also an applied aspect of their bodhicitta. Great compassion must also be closely joined with the perfection of wisdom, which reveals that all the beings that the bodhisattva strives to save are ultimately empty of self (&quot;anātman&quot;) and lack inherent existence (&quot;niḥsvabhāva&quot;). Due to the bodhisattva&#x27;s compassionate wish to save all beings, they develop innumerable skillful means or strategies (&quot;upaya&quot;) with which to teach and guide different kinds of beings with all sorts of different inclinations and tendencies.

Another key virtue for the bodhisattva is mindfulness (&quot;smṛti&quot;), which Dayal calls &quot;the sine qua non of moral progress for a bodhisattva.&quot; Mindfulness is widely emphasized by Buddhist authors and Sanskrit sources and it appears four times in the list of 37 &quot;bodhipakṣadharmas&quot;. According to the &quot;Aṣṭasāhasrikā&quot;, a bodhisattva must never lose mindfulness so as not to be confused or distracted. The &quot;Mahāyānasūtrālamkāra&quot; states that mindfulness is the principal asset of a bodhisattva, while both Asvaghosa and Shantideva state that without mindfulness, a bodhisattva will be helpless and uncontrolled (like a mad elephant) and will not succeed in conquering the mental afflictions.

=== Length and nature of the path ===

Just as with non-Mahayana sources, Mahayana sutras generally depict the bodhisattva path as a long path that takes many lifetimes across many aeons. Some sutras state that a beginner bodhisattva could take anywhere from 3 to 22 countless eons (&quot;mahāsaṃkhyeya kalpas&quot;) to become a Buddha. The &quot;Mahāyānasaṃgraha&quot; of Asanga states that the bodhisattva must cultivate the six paramitas for three incalculable aeons (&quot;kalpāsaṃkhyeya&quot;). Shantideva meanwhile states that bodhisattvas must practice each perfection for sixty aeons or kalpas and also declares that a bodhisattva must practice the path for an &quot;inconceivable&quot; (&quot;acintya&quot;) number of kalpas. Thus, the bodhisattva path could take many billions upon billions of years to complete.

Later developments in Indian and Asian Mahayana Buddhism (especially in Vajrayana or tantric Buddhism) lead to the idea that certain methods and practices could substantially shorten the path (and even lead to Buddhahood in a single lifetime). In Pure Land Buddhism, an aspirant might go to a Buddha&#x27;s pure land or buddha-field (&quot;buddhakṣetra&quot;), like Sukhavati, where they can study the path directly with a Buddha. This could significantly shorten the length of the path, or at least make it more bearable. East Asian Pure Land Buddhist traditions, such as Jōdo-shū and Jōdo Shinshū, hold the view that realizing Buddhahood through the long bodhisattva path of the perfections is no longer practical in the current age (which is understood as a degenerate age called &quot;mappo&quot;). Thus, they rely on the salvific power of Amitabha to bring Buddhist practitioners to the pure land of Sukhavati, where they will better be able to practice the path.

This view is rejected by other schools such as Tendai, Shingon and Zen. The founders of Tendai and Shingon, Saicho and Kukai, held that anyone who practiced the path properly could reach awakening in this very lifetime. Buddhist schools like Tiantai, Huayan, Chan and the various Vajrayāna traditions maintain that they teach ways to attain Buddhahood within one lifetime.

Some of early depictions of the Bodhisattva path in texts such as the &quot;Ugraparipṛcchā Sūtra&quot; describe it as an arduous, difficult monastic path suited only for the few which is nevertheless the most glorious path one can take. Three kinds of bodhisattvas are mentioned: the forest, city, and monastery bodhisattvas—with forest dwelling being promoted a superior, even necessary path in sutras such as the &quot;Ugraparipṛcchā&quot; and the &quot;Samadhiraja&quot; sutras. The early &quot;Rastrapalapariprccha sutra&quot; also promotes a solitary life of meditation in the forests, far away from the distractions of the householder life. The &quot;Rastrapala&quot; is also highly critical of monks living in monasteries and in cities who are seen as not practicing meditation and morality.

The &quot;Ratnagunasamcayagatha&quot; also says the bodhisattva should undertake ascetic practices (&quot;dhūtaguṇa&quot;), &quot;wander freely without a home&quot;, practice the paramitas and train under a guru in order to perfect his meditation practice and realization of &quot;prajñaparamita&quot;. The twelve &quot;dhūtaguṇas&quot; are also promoted by the &quot;King of Samadhis Sutra&quot;, the &quot;Ten Stages Sutra&quot; and Shantideva. Some scholars have used these texts to argue for &quot;the forest hypothesis&quot;, the theory that the initial Bodhisattva ideal was associated with a strict forest asceticism. But other scholars point out that many other Mahayana sutras do not promote this ideal, and instead teach &quot;easy&quot; practices like memorizing, reciting, teaching and copying Mahayana sutras, as well as meditating on Buddhas and bodhisattvas (and reciting or chanting their names). Ulrich Pagel also notes that in numerous sutras found in the &quot;Mahāratnakūṭa&quot; collection, the bodhisattva ideal is placed &quot;firmly within the reach of non-celibate layfolk.&quot;

=== Nirvana ===
Related to the different views on the different types of &quot;yanas&quot; or vehicles is the question of a bodhisattva&#x27;s relationship to nirvāṇa. In the various Mahāyāna texts, two theories can be discerned. One view is the idea that a bodhisattva must postpone their awakening until full Buddhahood is attained (at which point one ceases to be reborn, which is the classical view of nirvāṇa). This view is promoted in some sutras like the &quot;Pañcavimsatisahasrika-prajñaparamita-sutra.&quot; The idea is also found in the &quot;Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra&quot;, which mentions that bodhisattvas take the following vow: &quot;I shall not enter into final nirvana before all beings have been liberated.&quot; Likewise, the &quot;Śikṣāsamuccaya&quot; states &quot;I must lead all beings to Liberation. I will stay here till the end, even for the sake of one living soul.&quot;

The second theory is the idea that there are two kinds of nirvāṇa, the nirvāṇa of an arhat and a superior type of nirvāṇa called &quot;apratiṣṭhita (&quot;non-abiding) that allows a Buddha to remain engaged in the samsaric realms without being affected by them. This attainment was understood as a kind of non-dual state in which one is neither limited to samsara nor nirvana. A being who has reached this kind of nirvana is not restricted from manifesting in the samsaric realms, and yet they remain fully detached from the defilements found in these realms (and thus they can help others).

This doctrine of non-abiding nirvana developed in the Yogacara school. As noted by Paul Williams, the idea of &quot;apratiṣṭhita nirvāṇa&quot; may have taken some time to develop and is not obvious in some of the early Mahāyāna literature, therefore while earlier sutras may sometimes speak of &quot;postponement&quot;, later texts saw no need to postpone the &quot;superior&quot; &quot;apratiṣṭhita nirvāṇa&quot;.

In this Yogacara model, the bodhisattva definitely rejects and avoids the liberation of the &quot;śravaka&quot; and &quot;pratyekabuddha&quot;, described in Mahāyāna literature as either inferior or &quot;&quot;hina&quot;&quot; (as in Asaṅga&#x27;s fourth century &quot;Yogācārabhūmi&quot;) or as ultimately false or illusory (as in the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot;). That a bodhisattva has the option to pursue such a lesser path, but instead chooses the long path towards Buddhahood is one of the five criteria for one to be considered a bodhisattva. The other four are: being human, being a man, making a vow to become a Buddha in the presence of a previous Buddha, and receiving a prophecy from that Buddha.

Over time, a more varied analysis of bodhisattva careers developed focused on one&#x27;s motivation. This can be seen in the Tibetan Buddhist teaching on three types of motivation for generating bodhicitta. According to Patrul Rinpoche&#x27;s 19th-century &quot;Words of My Perfect Teacher&quot; (&quot;Kun bzang bla ma&#x27;i gzhal lung&quot;), a bodhisattva might be motivated in one of three ways. They are:

# King-like bodhicitta – To aspire to become a Buddha first in order to then help sentient beings.
# Boatman-like bodhicitta – To aspire to become a Buddha at the same time as other sentient beings.
# Shepherd-like bodhicitta – To aspire to become a Buddha only after all other sentient beings have done so.

These three are not types of people, but rather types of motivation. According to Patrul Rinpoche, the third quality of intention is most noble though the mode by which Buddhahood occurs is the first; that is, it is only possible to teach others the path to enlightenment once one has attained enlightenment oneself.

===Bodhisattva stages===

According to James B. Apple, if one studies the earliest textual materials which discuss the bodhisattva path (which includes the translations of Lokakshema and the Gandharan manuscripts), &quot;one finds four key stages that are demarcated throughout this early textual material that constitute the most basic elements in the path of a bodhisattva&quot;. These main elements are:

# &quot;The arising of the thought of awakening (&quot;bodhicittotpāda&quot;), when a person first aspires to attain the state of Buddhahood and thereby becomes a bodhisattva&quot;
# &quot;Endurance towards the fact that things are not produced&quot; (&quot;anutpattikadharma-kṣānti&quot;), which in various sources also entails non-retrogression.
# &quot;The attainment of the status of irreversibility&quot; or non-retrogression (&quot;avaivartika&quot;) from Buddhahood, which means one is close to Buddhahood and that one can no longer turn back or regress from that attainment. They are exemplary monks, with cognitive powers equal to arhats. They practice the four dhyanas, have a deep knowledge of perfect wisdom and teach it to others. In the Lokakshema&#x27;s Chinese translation of the &quot;Aṣṭasāhasrikā,&quot; the &quot;Daoxing Banruo Jing,&quot; this stage is closely related to a concentration (&quot;samadhi&quot;) that &quot;does not grasp at anything at all&quot; (&quot;sarvadharmāparigṛhīta&quot;).
# The prediction (&quot;vyākaraṇa&quot;), &quot;the event when a Buddha predicts the time and place of a bodhisattva&#x27;s subsequent awakening.&quot; The prediction is directly associated with the status of irreversibility. The &quot;Daoxing Banruo Jing&quot; states: &quot;all the bodhisattvas who have realized the irreversible stage have obtained their prediction to Buddhahood from the Buddhas in the past.&quot;

According to Drewes, the &quot;Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra&quot; divides the bodhisattva path into three main stages. The first stage is that of bodhisattvas who &quot;first set out in the vehicle&quot; (&quot;prathamayānasaṃprasthita&quot;), then there is the &quot;irreversible&quot; (&quot;avinivartanīya&quot;) stage, and finally the third &quot;bound by one more birth&quot; (&quot;ekajātipratibaddha&quot;), as in, destined to become a Buddha in the next life. Lamotte also mentions four similar stages of the bodhiattva career which are found in the &quot;Dazhidulun&quot; translated by Kumarajiva: (1) &quot;Prathamacittotpādika&quot; (&quot;who produces the mind of Bodhi for the first time&quot;), (2) &quot;Ṣaṭpāramitācaryāpratipanna&quot; (&quot;devoted to the practice of the six perfections&quot;), (3) &quot;Avinivartanīya&quot; (non-regression), (4) &quot;Ekajātipratibaddha&quot; (&quot;separated by only one lifetime from buddhahood&quot;).

Drewes notes that Mahāyāna sūtras mainly depict a bodhisattvas&#x27; first arising of bodhicitta as occurring in the presence of a Buddha. Furthermore, according to Drewes, most Mahāyāna sūtras &quot;never encourage anyone to become a bodhisattva or present any ritual or other means of doing so.&quot; In a similar manner to the nikāya sources, Mahāyāna sūtras also see new bodhisattvas as likely to regress, while seeing irreversible bodhisattvas are quite rare. Thus, according to Drewes, &quot;the &quot;Aṣṭasāhasrikā&quot;, for instance, states that as many bodhisattvas as there grains of sand in the Ganges turn back from the pursuit of Buddhahood and that out of innumerable beings who give rise to bodhicitta and progress toward Buddhahood, only one or two will reach the point of becoming irreversible.&quot;

Drewes also adds that early texts like the &quot;Aṣṭasāhasrikā&quot; treat bodhisattvas who are beginners (&quot;ādikarmika&quot;) or &quot;not long set out in the [great] vehicle&quot; with scorn, describing them as &quot;blind&quot;, &quot;unintelligent&quot;, &quot;lazy&quot; and &quot;weak&quot;. Early Mahayana works identify them with those who reject Mahayana or who abandon Mahayana, and they are seen as likely to become &quot;śrāvakas&quot; (those on the &quot;arhat&quot; path). Rather than encouraging them to become bodhisattvas, what early Mahayana sutras like the &quot;Aṣṭa&quot; do is to help individuals determine if they have already received a prediction in a past life, or if they are close to this point.

The &quot;Aṣṭa&quot; provides a variety of methods, including forms of ritual or divination, methods dealing with dreams and various tests, especially tests based on one&#x27;s reaction to the hearing of the content in the &quot;Aṣṭasāhasrikā&quot; itself. The text states that encountering and accepting its teachings mean one is close to being given a prediction and that if one does not &quot;shrink back, cower or despair&quot; from the text, but &quot;firmly believes it&quot;, one is either irreversible or is close to this stage. Many other Mahayana sutras such as the &quot;Akṣobhyavyūha&quot;, &quot;Vimalakīrtinirdeśa&quot;, &quot;Sukhāvatīvyūha&quot;, and the &quot;Śūraṃgamasamādhi Sūtra&quot; present textual approaches to determine one&#x27;s status as an advanced bodhisattva. These mainly depend on a person&#x27;s attitude towards listening to, believing, preaching, proclaiming, copying or memorizing and reciting the sutra as well as practicing the sutra&#x27;s teachings.

According to Drewes, this claim that merely having faith in Mahāyāna sūtras meant that one was an advanced bodhisattva, was a departure from previous Nikaya views about bodhisattvas. It created new groups of Buddhists who accepted each other&#x27;s bodhisattva status. Some Mahayana texts are more open with their bodhisattva doctrine. The &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot; famously assures large numbers people that they will certainly achieve Buddhahood, with few requirements (other than hearing and accepting the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot; itself).

==== Avaivartika (non-retrogression) ====
The term &quot;avaivartika&quot; refers to the stage in Buddhist practice where a practitioner reaches a point of irreversibility, ensuring that they will not regress in their spiritual progress. Alternative Sanskrit forms include &quot;avivartika&quot;, &quot;avinivartanīya&quot; and &quot;avaivartyabhūmi.&quot; Attaining this state guarantees that the practitioner remains steadfast on the path to enlightenment and will not abandon their aspirations or regress to a lower stage of realization. 

Within the framework of the Bodhisattva path, various Buddhist scriptures identify different stages at which non-retrogression is attained. Some sources associate it with the path of preparation (&quot;prayogamārga&quot;), where a bodhisattva solidifies their commitment and will no longer turn back to pursue the path of an arhat. Others link it to the first &quot;bhūmi&quot; (stage) of the bodhisattva path or, in later systematic presentations, to the eighth &quot;bhūmi&quot;, after which full Buddhahood becomes inevitable. 

The concept of &quot;avaivartika&quot; appears in early Mahāyāna texts such as the &quot;Mahāprajñāpāramitāśāstra&quot;, which distinguishes between bodhisattvas who are prone to regression (&quot;vaivartika&quot;) and those who are not (&quot;avaivartika&quot;). True bodhisattvas are those who have transcended the possibility of falling back, while those who remain susceptible to regression are considered bodhisattvas only in a nominal sense. 

The &quot;Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra&quot;, particularly in its early Chinese translation by Lokakṣema, emphasizes &quot;avaivartika&quot; as a pivotal attainment. It describes how the bodhisattva, upon reaching the state of &quot;anutpattikadharmakṣānti&quot; (the realization of the unborn nature of phenomena), becomes irreversible in their journey toward complete enlightenment. Unlike later Mahāyāna texts, which integrate this stage within the structured &quot;bhūmi&quot; system, Lokakṣema’s version presents it more fluidly, portraying the &quot;avaivartin&quot; as one of a few key categories of bodhisattvas. 

In Pure Land traditions, rebirth in Amitābha Buddha’s Pure Land (&quot;Sukhāvatī&quot;) is equated with entering the stage of non-retrogression. It is believed that those who attain birth in Sukhāvatī are assured of progressing toward enlightenment without the risk of falling back into lower states of existence. 

The attainment of &quot;avaivartika&quot; is often associated with the bodhisattva’s ability to inspire and lead countless beings toward liberation. Some texts suggest that a bodhisattva’s non-retrogression is linked to prior predictions (&quot;vyākaraṇa&quot;) made by past Buddhas, affirming their inevitable attainment of supreme enlightenment. Moreover, while later traditions integrate skillful means (&quot;upāyakauśalya&quot;) as a defining trait of the &quot;avaivartin&quot;, early texts such as Lokakṣema’s &quot;Aṣṭa&quot; emphasize avoiding complacency in meditative absorption, which could lead to an arhat-like state rather than the full Buddhahood sought by bodhisattvas. 

==== Bhūmis (stages) ====

According to various Mahāyāna sources, on the way to becoming a Buddha, a bodhisattva proceeds through various stages (&quot;bhūmis&quot;) of spiritual progress&quot;.&quot; The term &quot;bhūmi&quot; means &quot;earth&quot; or &quot;place&quot; and figurately can mean &quot;ground, plane, stage, level; state of consciousness&quot;. There are various lists of bhumis, the most common is a list of ten found in the &quot;Daśabhūmikasūtra&quot; (but there are also lists of seven stages as well as lists which have more than 10 stages).

The &quot;Daśabhūmikasūtra&quot; lists the following ten stages:

# Great Joy: It is said that being close to enlightenment and seeing the benefit for all sentient beings, one achieves great joy, hence the name. In this &quot;bhūmi&quot; the bodhisattvas practice all perfections (&quot;pāramitās&quot;), but especially emphasizing generosity (&quot;dāna&quot;).
# Stainless: In accomplishing the second &quot;bhūmi&quot;, the bodhisattva is free from the stains of immorality, therefore, this &quot;bhūmi&quot; is named &quot;stainless&quot;. The emphasized perfection is moral discipline (&quot;śīla&quot;).
# Luminous: The light of Dharma is said to radiate for others from the bodhisattva who accomplishes the third &quot;bhūmi&quot;. The emphasized perfection is patience (&quot;&quot;).
# Radiant: This &quot;bhūmi&quot; it is said to be like a radiating light that fully burns that which opposes enlightenment. The emphasized perfection is vigor (&quot;vīrya&quot;).
# Very difficult to train: Bodhisattvas who attain this ground strive to help sentient beings attain maturity, and do not become emotionally involved when such beings respond negatively, both of which are difficult to do. The emphasized perfection is meditative concentration (&quot;dhyāna&quot;).
# Obviously Transcendent: By depending on the perfection of wisdom, [the bodhisattva] does not abide in either &quot;&quot; or &quot;&quot;, so this state is &quot;obviously transcendent&quot;. The emphasized perfection is wisdom (&quot;prajñā&quot;).
# Gone afar: Particular emphasis is on the perfection of skillful means (&quot;upāya&quot;), to help others.
# Immovable: The emphasized virtue is aspiration. This &quot;immovable&quot; &quot;bhūmi&quot; is where one becomes able to choose his place of rebirth.
# Good Discriminating Wisdom: The emphasized virtue is the understanding of self and non-self.
# Cloud of Dharma: The emphasized virtue is the practice of primordial wisdom. After this &quot;bhūmi&quot;, one attains full Buddhahood.

In some sources, these ten stages are correlated with a different schema of the buddhist path called the five paths which is derived from Vaibhasika Abhidharma sources.

The &quot;Śūraṅgama Sūtra&quot; recognizes 57 stages. Various Vajrayāna schools recognize additional grounds (varying from 3 to 10 further stages), mostly 6 more grounds with variant descriptions. A bodhisattva above the 7th ground is called a &quot;mahāsattva&quot;. Some bodhisattvas such as Samantabhadra are also said to have already attained Buddhahood.

===Sōtō Zen===
As part of the Sōtō Zen school of Mahāyanā, Dōgen Zenji described Four Exemplary Acts of a Bodhisattva:

* Offering Alms: Not being covetous or greedy;
* Kind Speech: Feeling genuine affection for other sentient beings and offering words that are neither harsh nor rude.
* Benevolence: Working out skillful methods to benefit sentient beings, be they of low or high station.
* Manifesting Sympathy: Not making differences, not treating yourself as different and not treating others as different.

== Mahayana bodhisattvas ==


Buddhists (especially Mahayanists) venerate several bodhisattvas (such as Maitreya, Manjushri and Avalokiteshvara) which are seen as highly spiritually advanced (having attained the tenth bhumi) and thus possessing immense magical power. According to Lewis Lancaster, these &quot;celestial&quot; or &quot;heavenly&quot; bodhisattvas are seen as &quot;either the manifestations of a Buddha or they are beings who possess the power of producing many bodies through great feats of magical transformation.&quot;

The religious devotion to these bodhisattvas probably first developed in north India, and they are widely depicted in Gandharan and Kashmiri art. In Asian art, they are typically depicted as princes and princesses, with royal robes and jewellery (since they are the princes of the Dharma). In Buddhist art, a bodhisattva is often described as a beautiful figure with a serene expression and graceful manner. This is probably in accordance to the description of Prince Siddhārtha Gautama as a bodhisattva. The depiction of bodhisattva in Buddhist art around the world aspires to express the bodhisattva&#x27;s qualities such as loving-kindness (&quot;metta&quot;), compassion (&quot;karuna&quot;), empathetic joy (&quot;mudita&quot;) and equanimity (&quot;upekkha&quot;).

Literature which glorifies such bodhisattvas and recounts their various miracles remains very popular in Asia. One example of such a work of literature is &quot;More Records of Kuan-shih-yin&#x27;s Responsive Manifestations&quot; by Lu Kao (459–532) which was very influential in China. In Tibetan Buddhism, the &quot;Maṇi Kambum&quot; is a similarly influential text (a revealed text, or terma) which focuses on Chenrezig (Avalokiteshvara, who is seen as the country&#x27;s patron bodhisattva) and his miraculous activities in Tibet. 

These celestial bodhisattvas like Avalokiteshvara (Guanyin) are also seen as compassionate savior figures, constantly working for the good of all beings. The Avalokiteshvara chapter of the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot; even states that calling Avalokiteshvara to mind can help save someone from natural disasters, demons, and other calamities. It is also supposed to protect one from the afflictions (lust, anger and ignorance). Bodhisattvas can also transform themselves into whatever physical form is useful for helping sentient beings (a god, a bird, a male or female, even a Buddha). Because of this, bodhisattvas are seen as beings that one can pray to for aid and consolation from the sufferings of everyday life as well as for guidance in the path to enlightenment. Thus, the great translator Xuanzang is said to have constantly prayed to Avalokiteshvara for protection on his long journey to India.

=== Eight main Bodhisattvas ===

In the later Indian Vajrayana tradition, there arose a popular grouping of eight bodhisattvas known as the &quot;Eight Great Bodhisattvas&quot;, or &quot;Eight Close Sons&quot; (Skt. &quot;aṣṭa utaputra&quot;; Tib. &quot;nyewé sé gyé&quot;) and are seen as the most important Mahayana bodhisattvas and appear in numerous esoteric mandalas (e.g. Garbhadhatu mandala). 

These same &quot;Eight Great Bodhisattvas&quot; (Chn. &quot;Bādà Púsà&quot;, Jp. &quot;Hachi Daibosatsu&quot;) also appear in East Asian Esoteric Buddhist sources, such as &quot;The Sutra on the Maṇḍalas of the Eight Great Bodhisattvas&quot; (八大菩薩曼荼羅經), translated by Amoghavajra in the 8th century and Faxian (10th century). 

While there are numerous lists of Eight Great Bodhisattvas, the most widespread or &quot;standard&quot; listing is: 

* Mañjuśrī (&quot;Gentle Glory&quot;) Kumarabhuta (&quot;Young Prince&quot;), the main bodhisattva of wisdom
* Avalokiteśvara (&quot;Lord who gazes down at the world&quot;), the savior bodhisattva of great compassion
* Vajrapāṇi (&quot;Vajra in hand&quot;), the bodhisattva of protection, the protector of the Buddha (in East Asian sources, this figure appears as Mahāsthāmaprāpta)
* Maitreya (&quot;Friendly One&quot;), will become the Buddha of our world in the future
* Kṣitigarbha (&quot;Earth Source&quot;)
* Ākāśagarbha (&quot;Space Source&quot;) also known as Gaganagañja
* Sarvanivāraṇaviṣkambhin (&quot;He who blocks the hindrances&quot;)
* Samantabhadra (&quot;Universal Worthy&quot;, or &quot;All Good&quot;)

=== Female bodhisattvas ===


The bodhisattva Prajñāpāramitā-devi is a female personification of the perfection of wisdom and the &quot;Prajñāpāramitā sutras&quot;. She became an important figure, widely depicted in Indian Buddhist art.

Guanyin (Jp: Kannon), a female form of Avalokiteshvara, is the most widely revered bodhisattva in East Asian Buddhism, generally depicted as a motherly figure. Guanyin is venerated in various other forms and manifestations, including Cundī, Cintāmaṇicakra, Hayagriva, Eleven-Headed Thousand-Armed Guanyin and Guanyin Of The Southern Seas among others.

Gender variant representations of some bodhisattvas, most notably Avalokiteśvara, has prompted conversation regarding the nature of a bodhisattva&#x27;s appearance. Chan master Sheng Yen has stated that Mahāsattvas such as Avalokiteśvara (known as Guanyin in Chinese) are androgynous (Ch. 中性; pinyin: &quot;zhōngxìng&quot;), which accounts for their ability to manifest in masculine and feminine forms of various degrees.

In Tibetan Buddhism, Tara or Jetsun Dölma (&quot;rje btsun sgrol ma&quot;) is the most important female bodhisattva.

Numerous Mahayana sutras feature female bodhisattvas as main characters and discuss their life, teachings and future Buddhahood. These include &quot;The Questions of the Girl Vimalaśraddhā&quot; (Tohoku Kangyur - Toh number 84), &quot;The Questions of Vimaladattā&quot; (Toh 77), &quot;The Lion&#x27;s Roar of Śrīmālādevī&quot; (Toh 92), &quot;The Inquiry of Lokadhara&quot; (Toh 174), &quot;The Sūtra of Aśokadattā&#x27;s Prophecy&quot; (Toh 76), &quot;The Questions of Vimalaprabhā&quot; (Toh 168), &quot;The Sūtra of Kṣemavatī&#x27;s Prophecy&quot; (Toh 192), &quot;The Questions of the Girl Sumati&quot; (Toh 74), &quot;The Questions of Gaṅgottara&quot; (Toh 75), &quot;The Questions of an Old Lady&quot; (Toh 171), &quot;The Miraculous Play of Mañjuśrī&quot; (Toh 96), and &quot;The Sūtra of the Girl Candrottarā&#x27;s Prophecy&quot; (Toh 191).

=== Popular figures ===
Over time, numerous historical Buddhist figures also came to be seen as bodhisattvas in their own right, deserving of devotion. For example, an extensive hagiography developed around Nagarjuna, the Indian founder of the madhyamaka school of philosophy. Followers of Tibetan Buddhism consider the Dalai Lamas and the Karmapas to be an emanation of Chenrezig, the Bodhisattva of Compassion. Various Japanese Buddhist schools consider their founding figures like Kukai and Nichiren to be bodhisattvas. In Chinese Buddhism, various historical figures have been called bodhisattvas.

Furthermore, various Hindu deities are considered to be bodhisattvas in Mahayana Buddhist sources. For example, in the &quot;Kāraṇḍavyūhasūtra&quot;, Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma and Saraswati are said to be bodhisattvas, all emanations of Avalokiteshvara. Deities like Saraswati (Chinese: &quot;Biàncáitiān&quot;, 辯才天, Japanese: Benzaiten) and Shiva (C: &quot;Dàzìzàitiān&quot;, 大自在天; J: Daikokuten) are still venerated as bodhisattva devas and dharmapalas (guardian deities) in East Asian Buddhism. Both figures are closely connected with Avalokiteshvara. In a similar manner, the Hindu deity Harihara is called a bodhisattva in the famed &quot;Nīlakaṇṭha Dhāraṇī,&quot; which states: &quot;O Effulgence, World-Transcendent, come, oh Hari, the great bodhisattva.&quot;

The empress Wu Zetian of the Tang dynasty, was the only female ruler of China. She used the growing popularity of Esoteric Buddhism in China for her own needs. Though she was not the only ruler to have made such a claim, the political utility of her claims, coupled with sincerity make her a great example. She built several temples and contributed to the finishing of the Longmen Caves and even went on to patronise Buddhism over Confucianism or Daoism. She ruled by the title of &quot;Holy Emperor&quot;, and claimed to be a Bodhisattva too. She became one of China&#x27;s most influential rulers.

=== Others ===
Other important bodhisattvas in Mahayana Buddhism include:

* Bhadrapāla, appearing in various sutras like the &quot;Lotus&quot;
* Vajrasattva, an important figure in Vajrayana Buddhism
* Vimalakirti the famous lay bodhisattva of the &quot;Vimalakīrti Nirdeśa&quot;
* Akṣayamati, the main character in the influential &quot;Akṣayamatinirdeśa Sūtra&quot; 
* Sadāprarudita, a major bodhisattva in the Prajñāpāramitā sutras
* Sudhana, the main character of the &quot;Gaṇḍavyūha Sutra&quot;
* The Four Bodhisattvas of the Earth from the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;
* Bhaiṣajyarāja or &quot;Medicine King&quot;
* Candraprabha (&quot;Moon Light&quot;)
* Sūryaprabha (&quot;Solar Light&quot;)
* Jambhala, a bodhisattva of wealth
* Mahāsthāmaprāpta, the second attendant bodhisattva to Amitabha (after Avalokiteshvara)
* Akṣayamati

=== Fierce bodhisattvas ===

While bodhisattvas tend to be depicted as conventionally beautiful, there are instances of their manifestation as fierceful and monstrous looking beings. A notable example is Guanyin&#x27;s manifestation as a preta named &quot;Flaming Face&quot; (面燃大士). This trope is commonly employed among the Wisdom Kings, among whom Mahāmāyūrī Vidyārājñī stands out with a feminine title and benevolent expression. In some depictions, her mount takes on a wrathful appearance. This variation is also found among images of Vajrapani.

In Tibetan Buddhism, fierce manifestations (Tibetan: &quot;trowo)&quot; of the major bodhisattvas are quite common and they often act as protector deities.

=== Sacred places ===

The place of a bodhisattva&#x27;s earthly deeds, such as the achievement of enlightenment or the acts of Dharma, is known as a &quot;bodhimaṇḍa&quot; (place of awakening), and may be a site of pilgrimage. Many temples and monasteries are famous as bodhimaṇḍas. Perhaps the most famous bodhimaṇḍa of all is the Bodhi Tree under which Śākyamuṇi achieved Buddhahood. There are also sacred places of awakening for bodhisattvas located throughout the Buddhist world. Mount Potalaka, a sacred mountain in India, is traditionally held to be Avalokiteshvara&#x27;s bodhimaṇḍa.

In Chinese Buddhism, there are four mountains that are regarded as bodhimaṇḍas for bodhisattvas, with each site having major monasteries and being popular for pilgrimages by both monastics and laypeople. These four sacred places are:

* Mount Putuo for Guanyin (Avalokiteśvara), the bodhisattva of Compassion ()
* Mount Emei for Samantabhadra, the bodhisattva of practice ()
* Mount Wutai for Mañjuśrī, the bodhisattva of wisdom ()
* Mount Jiuhua for Kṣitigarbha, the bodhisattva of the great vow ()

== In Theravada Buddhism ==

While the veneration of bodhisattvas is much more widespread and popular in the Mahayana Buddhist world, it is also found in Theravada Buddhist regions. Bodhisattvas which are venerated in Theravada lands include Natha Deviyo (Avalokiteshvara), Metteya (Maitreya), Upulvan (i.e. Vishnu), Saman (Samantabhadra) and Pattini. The veneration of some of these figures may have been influenced by Mahayana Buddhism. These figures are also understood as devas that have converted to Buddhism and have sworn to protect it.

The recounting of Jataka tales, which discuss the bodhisattva deeds of Gautama before his awakening (i.e. during his past lives as a bodhisatta), also remains a popular practice.

== Etymology ==
The etymology of the Indic terms bodhisattva and bodhisatta is not fully understood. The term bodhi is uncontroversial and means &quot;awakening&quot; or &quot;enlightenment&quot; (from the root &quot;budh-&quot;). The second part of the compound has many possible meanings or derivations, including:

* Sattva and satta commonly means &quot;living being&quot;, &quot;sentient being&quot; or &quot;person&quot; and many modern scholars adopt an interpretation based on this etymology. Examples include: &quot;a sentient or reasonable being, possessing bodhi&quot; (H. Kern), &quot;a bodhi-being, i.e. a being destined to attain fullest Enlightenment&quot; (T. W. Rhys Davids and W. Stede), &quot;A being seeking for bodhi&quot; (M. Anesaki), &quot;Erleuchtungswesen&quot; (Enlightenment Being) (M. Winternitz), &quot;Weisheitswesen&quot; (&quot;Wisdom Being&quot;) (M. Walleser). This etymology is also supported by the Mahayana &quot;Samādhirāja Sūtra&quot;, which, however, explains the meaning of the term bodhisattva as &quot;one who admonishes or exhorts all beings.&quot;
* According to Har Dayal, the term &quot;bodhi-satta&quot; may correspond with the Sanskrit &quot;bodhi-sakta&quot; which means &quot;one who is devoted to bodhi&quot; or &quot;attached to bodhi&quot;. Later, the term may have been wrongly sanskritized to &quot;bodhi-satva&quot;. Hayal notes that the Sanskrit term &quot;sakta&quot; (from &quot;sañj&quot;) means &quot;clung, stuck or attached to, joined or connected with, addicted or devoted to, fond of, intent on&quot;. This etymology for &quot;satta&quot; is supported by some passages in the Early Buddhist Texts (such as at SN 23.2, parallel at SĀ 122). The etymology is also supported by the Pāli commentaries, Jain sources and other modern scholars like Tillman Vetter and Neumann. Another related possibility pointed out by K.R. Norman and others is that satta carries the meaning of &quot;śakta&quot;, and so bodhisatta means &quot;capable of enlightenment.&quot;
* The Sanskrit term sattva may mean &quot;strength, energy, vigour, power, courage&quot; and therefore, bodhisattva could also mean &quot;one whose energy and power is directed towards bodhi&quot;. This reading of sattva is found in Ksemendra&#x27;s &quot;AvadanakalpaIata.&quot; Har Dayal supports this reading, noting that the term sattva is &quot;almost certainly related to the Vedic word &quot;satvan&quot;, which means &#x27;a strong or valiant man, hero, warrior and thus, the term bodhisatta should be interpreted as &quot;heroic being, spiritual warrior.&quot;
* Sattva may also mean spirit, mind, sense, consciousness, or geist. Various Indian commentators like Prajñakaramati interpret the term as a synonym for citta (mind, thought) or vyavasāya (decision, determination). Thus, the term bodhisattva could also mean: &quot;one whose mind, intentions, thoughts or wishes are fixed on bodhi&quot;. In this sense, this meaning of &quot;sattva&quot; is similar to the meaning it has in the &quot;Yoga-sutras&quot;, where it means mind.
* Tibetan lexicographers translate bodhisattva as &quot;byang chub&quot; (bodhi) &quot;sems dpa&quot; (sattva). In this compound, &quot;sems&quot; means mind, while &quot;dpa&quot; means &quot;hero, strong man&quot; (Skt. &quot;vīra&quot;). Thus, this translation combines two possible etymologies of sattva explained above: as &quot;mind&quot; and as &quot;courageous, hero&quot;.
* Chinese Buddhists generally use the term &quot;pusa&quot; (菩薩), a phonetic transcription of the Sanskrit term. However, early Chinese translators sometimes used a meaning translation of the term bodhisattva, which they rendered as &quot;mingshi&quot; (明士)&quot;,&quot; which means &quot;a person who understands&quot;, reading &quot;sattva&quot; as &quot;man&quot; or &quot;person&quot; (&quot;shi&quot;, 士). 
* In Sanskrit, &quot;sattva&quot; can mean &quot;essence, nature, true essence&quot;, and the Pali &quot;satta&quot; can mean &quot;substance&quot;. Some modern scholars interpret bodhisattva in this light, such as Monier-Williams, who translates the term as &quot;one who has bodhi or perfect wisdom as his essence.&quot;

<doc id="3969" wikidata="Q42182" url="?curid=3969" title="Buckingham Palace">
<text>Buckingham Palace () is a royal residence in London, and the administrative headquarters of the monarch of the United Kingdom. Located in the City of Westminster, the palace is often at the centre of state occasions and royal hospitality. It has been a focal point for the British people at times of national rejoicing and mourning.

Originally known as Buckingham House, the building at the core of today&#x27;s palace was a large townhouse built for the Duke of Buckingham and Normanby in 1703 on a site that had been in private ownership for at least 150 years. It was acquired by George III in 1761 as a private residence for Queen Charlotte and became known as The Queen&#x27;s House. During the 19th century it was enlarged by architects John Nash and Edward Blore, who constructed three wings around a central courtyard. Buckingham Palace became the London residence of the British monarch on the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837.

The last major structural additions were made in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including the East Front, which contains the balcony on which the royal family traditionally appears to greet crowds. A German bomb destroyed the palace chapel during the Second World War; the King&#x27;s Gallery was built on the site and opened to the public in 1962 to exhibit works of art from the Royal Collection.

The original early-19th-century interior designs, many of which survive, include widespread use of brightly coloured scagliola and blue and pink lapis, on the advice of Charles Long. King Edward VII oversaw a partial redecoration in a Belle Époque cream and gold colour scheme. Many smaller reception rooms are furnished in the Chinese regency style with furniture and fittings brought from the Royal Pavilion at Brighton and from Carlton House. The palace has 775 rooms, and the garden is the largest private garden in London. The state rooms, used for official and state entertaining, are open to the public each year for most of August and September and on some days in winter and spring.

==History==

===Pre-1624===
In the Middle Ages, the site of the future palace formed part of the Manor of Ebury (also called Eia). The marshy ground was watered by the river Tyburn, which still flows below the courtyard and south wing of the palace. Where the river was fordable (at Cow Ford), the village of Eye Cross grew. Ownership of the site changed hands many times; owners included Edward the Confessor and Edith of Wessex in late Saxon times, and, after the Norman Conquest, William the Conqueror. William gave the site to Geoffrey de Mandeville, who bequeathed it to the monks of Westminster Abbey.

In 1531, Henry VIII acquired the Hospital of St James, which became St James&#x27;s Palace, from Eton College, and in 1536 he took the Manor of Ebury from Westminster Abbey. These transfers brought the site of Buckingham Palace back into royal hands for the first time since William the Conqueror had given it away almost 500 years earlier. Various owners leased it from royal landlords, and the freehold was the subject of frenzied speculation during the 17th century. By then, the old village of Eye Cross had long since fallen into decay, and the area was mostly wasteland. Needing money, James VI and I sold off part of the Crown freehold but retained part of the site on which he established a mulberry garden for the production of silk. (This is at the north-west corner of today&#x27;s palace.) Clement Walker in &quot;Anarchia Anglicana&quot; (1649) refers to &quot;new-erected sodoms and spintries at the Mulberry Garden at S. James&#x27;s&quot;; this suggests it may have been a place of debauchery. Eventually, in the late 17th century, the freehold was inherited from the property tycoon Hugh Audley by the great heiress Mary Davies.

===First houses on the site (1624–1761)===

Possibly the first house erected within the site was that of William Blake, around 1624. The next owner was George Goring, 1st Earl of Norwich, who from 1633 extended Blake&#x27;s house, which came to be known as Goring House, and developed much of today&#x27;s garden, then known as Goring Great Garden. He did not, however, obtain the freehold interest in the mulberry garden. Unbeknown to Goring, in 1640 the document &quot;failed to pass the Great Seal before Charles I fled London, which it needed to do for legal execution&quot;. It was this critical omission that would help the British royal family regain the freehold under George III. When the improvident Goring defaulted on his rents, Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington was able to purchase the lease of Goring House and he was occupying it when it burned down in 1674, following which he constructed Arlington House on the site – the location of the southern wing of today&#x27;s palace – the next year. In 1698, John Sheffield acquired the lease. He later became the first Duke of Buckingham and Normanby. Buckingham House was built for Sheffield in 1703 to the design of William Winde. The style chosen was of a large, three-floored central block with two smaller flanking service wings. It was eventually sold by Buckingham&#x27;s illegitimate son, Charles Sheffield, in 1761 to George III for £21,000. Sheffield&#x27;s leasehold on the mulberry garden site, the freehold of which was still owned by the royal family, was due to expire in 1774.

===From Queen&#x27;s House to palace (1761–1837)===
Under the new royal ownership, the building was originally intended as a private retreat for Queen Charlotte, and was accordingly known as The Queen&#x27;s House. Remodelling of the structure began in 1762. In 1775, an Act of Parliament settled the property on Queen Charlotte, in exchange for her rights to nearby Old Somerset House, and 14 of her 15 children were born there. Some furnishings were transferred from Carlton House and others had been bought in France after the French Revolution of 1789. While St James&#x27;s Palace remained the official and ceremonial royal residence, the name &quot;Buckingham Palace&quot; was used from at least 1791. 

After his accession to the throne in 1820, George IV continued the renovation, intending to create a small, comfortable home. However, in 1826, while the work was in progress, the King decided to modify the house into a palace with the help of his architect John Nash. The façade was designed with George IV&#x27;s preference for French neoclassical architecture in mind. The cost of the renovations grew dramatically, and by 1829 the extravagance of Nash&#x27;s designs resulted in his removal as the architect. On the death of George IV in 1830, his younger brother William IV hired Edward Blore to finish the work. William never moved into the palace, preferring Clarence House, which had been built to his specifications and which had been his London home while he was heir presumptive. After the Palace of Westminster was destroyed by fire in 1834, he offered to convert Buckingham Palace into a new Houses of Parliament, but his offer was declined.

===Queen Victoria (1837–1901)===

Buckingham Palace became the principal royal residence in 1837, on the accession of Queen Victoria, who was the first monarch to reside there. While the state rooms were a riot of gilt and colour, the necessities of the new palace were somewhat less luxurious. The chimneys were said to smoke so much that the fires had to be allowed to die down, and consequently the palace was often cold. Ventilation was so bad that the interior smelled, and when it was decided to install gas lamps, there was a serious worry about the build-up of gas on the lower floors. It was also said that the staff were lax and lazy and the palace was dirty. Following the Queen&#x27;s marriage in 1840, her husband, Prince Albert, concerned himself with a reorganisation of the household offices and staff, and with addressing the design faults of the palace. By the end of 1840, all the problems had been rectified. However, the builders were to return within a decade.

By 1847, the couple found the palace too small for court life and their growing family and a new wing, designed by Edward Blore, was built by Thomas Cubitt, enclosing the central quadrangle. The work, carried out from 1847 to 1849, was paid for by the sale of Brighton Pavilion in 1850. The large East Front, facing The Mall, is today the &quot;public face&quot; of Buckingham Palace and contains the balcony from which the royal family acknowledge the crowds on momentous occasions and after the annual Trooping the Colour. The ballroom wing and a further suite of state rooms were also built in this period, designed by Nash&#x27;s student James Pennethorne. Before Prince Albert&#x27;s death, in addition to royal ceremonies, investitures and presentations Buckingham Palace was frequently the scene of lavish costume balls and musical entertainments. The most celebrated contemporary musicians entertained there; for example Felix Mendelssohn is known to have played there on three occasions, and Johann Strauss II and his orchestra played there when in England.

Widowed in 1861, the grief-stricken Queen withdrew from public life and left Buckingham Palace to live at Windsor Castle, Balmoral Castle and Osborne House. For many years the palace was seldom used, even neglected. In 1864, a note was found pinned to the fence, saying: &quot;These commanding premises to be let or sold, in consequence of the late occupant&#x27;s declining business.&quot; Eventually, public opinion persuaded the Queen to return to London, though even then she preferred to live elsewhere whenever possible. Court functions were still held at Windsor Castle, presided over by the sombre Queen habitually dressed in mourning black, while Buckingham Palace remained shuttered for most of the year.

===Early 20th century (1901–1945)===
In 1901, the new king, Edward VII, began redecorating the palace. He and his wife, Queen Alexandra, had always been at the forefront of London high society, and their friends, known as &quot;the Marlborough House Set&quot;, were considered to be the most eminent and fashionable of the age. Buckingham Palace—the Ballroom, Grand Entrance, Marble Hall, Grand Staircase, vestibules and galleries were redecorated in the Belle Époque cream and gold colour scheme they retain today—once again became a setting for entertaining on a majestic scale but leaving some to feel Edward&#x27;s heavy redecorations were at odds with Nash&#x27;s original work.

The last major building work took place during the reign of George V when, in 1913, Aston Webb redesigned Blore&#x27;s 1850 East Front to resemble in part Giacomo Leoni&#x27;s Lyme Park in Cheshire. This new refaced principal façade (of Portland stone) was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria created by sculptor Thomas Brock, erected outside the main gates on a surround constructed by architect Aston Webb. George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertainment and royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919; the first jazz performance for a head of state), Sidney Bechet and Louis Armstrong (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom.

During the First World War, which lasted from 1914 until 1918, the palace escaped unscathed. Its more valuable contents were evacuated to Windsor, but the royal family remained in residence. The King imposed rationing at the palace, much to the dismay of his guests and household. To the King&#x27;s later regret, David Lloyd George persuaded him to go further and ostentatiously lock the wine cellars and refrain from alcohol, to set a good example to the supposedly inebriated working class. The workers continued to imbibe, and the King was left unhappy at his enforced abstinence.

George V&#x27;s wife, Queen Mary, was a connoisseur of the arts and took a keen interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it. Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the pair of marble Empire style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, dating from 1810, in the ground floor Bow Room, the huge low room at the centre of the garden façade. Queen Mary was also responsible for the decoration of the Blue Drawing Room. This room, long, previously known as the South Drawing Room, has a ceiling designed by Nash, coffered with huge gilt console brackets. In 1938, the northwest pavilion, designed by Nash as a conservatory, was converted into a swimming pool.

====Second World War====

During the Second World War, which broke out in 1939, the palace was bombed nine times. The most serious and publicised incident destroyed the palace chapel in 1940. One bomb fell in the palace quadrangle while George VI and Queen Elizabeth (the future Queen Mother) were in the palace, and many windows were blown in and the chapel destroyed. The King and Queen were filmed inspecting their bombed home, and the newsreel footage shown in cinemas throughout the United Kingdom to show the common suffering of rich and poor. As &quot;The Sunday Graphic&quot; reported:

It was at this time the Queen famously declared: &quot;I&#x27;m glad we have been bombed. Now I can look the East End in the face&quot;.

On 15 September 1940, known as Battle of Britain Day, an RAF pilot, Ray Holmes of No. 504 Squadron, rammed a German Dornier Do 17 bomber he believed was going to bomb the palace. Holmes had run out of ammunition to shoot down the bomber and made the quick decision to ram it. He bailed out and the bomber crashed into the forecourt of London Victoria station. Its engine was later exhibited at the Imperial War Museum in London. Holmes became a King&#x27;s Messenger after the war and died at the age of 90 in 2005. 

On VE Day—8 May 1945—the palace was the centre of British celebrations. The King, the Queen, Princess Elizabeth (the future queen) and Princess Margaret appeared on the balcony, with the palace&#x27;s blacked-out windows behind them, to cheers from a vast crowd in The Mall. The damaged palace was carefully restored after the war by John Mowlem &amp; Co.

===Mid-20th century to present day===

Many of the palace&#x27;s contents are part of the Royal Collection; they can, on occasion, be viewed by the public at the King&#x27;s Gallery, near the Royal Mews. The purpose-built gallery opened in 1962 and displays a changing selection of items from the collection. It occupies the site of the chapel that was destroyed in the Second World War. The palace was designated a Grade I listed building in 1970. Its state rooms have been open to the public during August and September and on some dates throughout the year since 1993. The money raised in entry fees was originally put towards the rebuilding of Windsor Castle after the 1992 fire devastated many of its staterooms. In the year to 31 March 2017, 580,000 people visited the palace, and 154,000 visited the gallery. In 2004, the palace attempted to claim money from the community energy fund to heat Buckingham Palace, but the claim was rejected due to fear of public backlash.

The palace used to racially segregate staff. In 1968, Charles Tryon, 2nd Baron Tryon, acting as treasurer to Queen Elizabeth II, sought to exempt Buckingham Palace from full application of the Race Relations Act 1968. He stated that the palace did not hire people of colour for clerical jobs, only as domestic servants. He arranged with civil servants for an exemption that meant that complaints of racism against the royal household would be sent directly to the Home Secretary and kept out of the legal system.

The palace, like Windsor Castle, is owned by the reigning monarch in right of the Crown. Occupied royal palaces are not part of the Crown Estate, nor are they the monarch&#x27;s personal property, unlike Sandringham House and Balmoral Castle. The Government of the United Kingdom is responsible for maintaining the palace in exchange for the profits made by the Crown Estate. In 2015, the State Dining Room was closed for a year and a half because its ceiling had become potentially dangerous. A 10-year schedule of maintenance work, including new plumbing, wiring, boilers and radiators, and the installation of solar panels on the roof, has been estimated to cost £369 million and was approved by the prime minister in November 2016. It will be funded by a temporary increase in the Sovereign Grant paid from the income of the Crown Estate and is intended to extend the building&#x27;s working life by at least 50 years. In 2017, the House of Commons backed funding for the project by 464 votes to 56.

Buckingham Palace is a symbol and home of the British monarchy, an art gallery and a tourist attraction. Behind the gilded railings and gates that were completed by the Bromsgrove Guild in 1911, lies Webb&#x27;s famous façade, which was described in a book published by the Royal Collection Trust as looking &quot;like everybody&#x27;s idea of a palace&quot;. It has not only been a weekday home of Elizabeth II and Prince Philip but was also the London residence and office of the Duke of York until 2023. Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh and Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh continue to have a private apartment in the palace for use when they are in London. The palace also houses their offices, as well as those of the Princess Royal and Princess Alexandra, and is the workplace of more than 800 people. Charles III lives at Clarence House while restoration work continues, although he conducts official business at Buckingham Palace, including weekly meetings with the prime minister. Every year, some 50,000 invited guests are entertained at garden parties, receptions, audiences and banquets. Three garden parties are held in the summer, usually in July. The forecourt of Buckingham Palace is used for the Changing of the Guard, a major ceremony and tourist attraction (daily from April to July; every other day in other months).

==Interior==

The front of the palace measures across, by deep, by high and contains over of floorspace. There are 775 rooms, including 188 staff bedrooms, 92 offices, 78 bathrooms, 52 principal bedrooms and 19 state rooms. It also has a post office, cinema, swimming pool, doctor&#x27;s surgery, and jeweller&#x27;s workshop. The royal family occupy a small suite of private rooms in the north wing.

=== Principal rooms ===
The principal rooms are contained on the first-floor &quot;piano nobile&quot; behind the west-facing garden façade at the rear of the palace. The centre of this ornate suite of state rooms is the Music Room, its large bow the dominant feature of the façade. Flanking the Music Room are the Blue and the White Drawing Rooms. At the centre of the suite, serving as a corridor to link the state rooms, is the Picture Gallery, which is top-lit and long. The Gallery is hung with numerous works including some by Rembrandt, van Dyck, Rubens and Vermeer; other rooms leading from the Picture Gallery are the Throne Room and the Green Drawing Room. The Green Drawing Room serves as a huge anteroom to the Throne Room, and is part of the ceremonial route to the throne from the Guard Room at the top of the Grand Staircase. The Guard Room contains white marble statues of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, in Roman costume, set in a tribune lined with tapestries. These very formal rooms are used only for ceremonial and official entertaining but are open to the public every summer.

=== Semi-state apartments ===

Directly underneath the state apartments are the less grand semi-state apartments. Opening from the Marble Hall, these rooms are used for less formal entertaining, such as luncheon parties and private audiences. At the centre of this floor is the Bow Room, through which thousands of guests pass annually to the monarch&#x27;s garden parties. When paying a state visit to Britain, foreign heads of state are usually entertained by the monarch at Buckingham Palace. They are allocated an extensive suite of rooms known as the Belgian Suite, situated at the foot of the Minister&#x27;s Staircase, on the ground floor of the west-facing Garden Wing. Some of the rooms are named and decorated for particular visitors, such as the 1844 Room, decorated in that year for the state visit of Nicholas I of Russia, and the 1855 Room, in honour of the visit of Napoleon III of France. The former is a sitting room that also serves as an audience room and is often used for personal investitures. Narrow corridors link the rooms of the suite; one of them is given extra height and perspective by saucer domes designed by Nash in the style of Soane. A second corridor in the suite has Gothic-influenced cross-over vaulting. The suite was named after Leopold I of Belgium, uncle of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. In 1936, the suite briefly became the private apartments of the palace when Edward VIII occupied them. The original early-19th-century interior designs, many of which still survive, included widespread use of brightly coloured scagliola and blue and pink lapis, on the advice of Charles Long. Edward VII oversaw a partial redecoration in a Belle Époque cream and gold colour scheme.

=== East wing ===

Between 1847 and 1850, when Blore was building the new east wing, the Brighton Pavilion was once again plundered of its fittings. As a result, many of the rooms in the new wing have a distinctly oriental atmosphere. The red and blue Chinese Luncheon Room is made up of parts of the Brighton Banqueting and Music Rooms with a large oriental chimneypiece designed by Robert Jones and sculpted by Richard Westmacott. It was formerly in the Music Room at the Brighton Pavilion. The ornate clock, known as the Kylin Clock, was made in Jingdezhen, Jiangxi Province, China, in the second half of the 18th century; it has a later movement by Benjamin Vulliamy circa 1820. The Yellow Drawing Room has hand-painted Chinese wallpaper supplied in 1817 for the Brighton Saloon, and a chimneypiece which is a European vision of a Chinese chimneypiece. It has nodding mandarins in niches and fearsome winged dragons, designed by Robert Jones.

At the centre of this wing is the famous balcony with the Centre Room behind its glass doors. This is a Chinese-style saloon enhanced by Queen Mary, who, working with the designer Charles Allom, created a more &quot;binding&quot; Chinese theme in the late 1920s, although the lacquer doors were brought from Brighton in 1873. Running the length of the &quot;piano nobile&quot; of the east wing is the Great Gallery, modestly known as the Principal Corridor, which runs the length of the eastern side of the quadrangle. It has mirrored doors and mirrored cross walls reflecting porcelain pagodas and other oriental furniture from Brighton. The Chinese Luncheon Room and Yellow Drawing Room are situated at each end of this gallery, with the Centre Room in between.

==Court ceremonies==

Investitures for the awarding of honours (which include the conferring of knighthoods by dubbing with a sword) usually take place in the palace&#x27;s Throne Room. Investitures are conducted by the King or another senior member of the royal family: a military band plays in the musicians&#x27; gallery, as recipients receive their honours, watched by their families and friends.
State banquets take place in the Ballroom, built in 1854. At long, wide and high, it is the largest room in the palace; at one end of the room is a throne dais (beneath a giant, domed velvet canopy, known as a &quot;shamiana&quot; or baldachin, that was used at the Delhi Durbar in 1911). State Banquets are formal dinners held on the first evening of a state visit by a foreign head of state. On these occasions, for up to 170 guests in formal &quot;white tie and decorations&quot;, including tiaras, the dining table is laid with the Grand Service, a collection of silver-gilt plate made in 1811 for the Prince of Wales, later George IV. 

The largest and most formal reception at Buckingham Palace takes place every November when the King entertains members of the diplomatic corps. On this grand occasion, all the state rooms are in use, as the royal family proceed through them, beginning at the great north doors of the Picture Gallery. As Nash had envisaged, all the large, double-mirrored doors stand open, reflecting the numerous crystal chandeliers and sconces, creating a deliberate optical illusion of space and light.

Smaller ceremonies such as the reception of new ambassadors take place in the &quot;1844 Room&quot;. Here too, the King holds small lunch parties, and often meetings of the Privy Council. Larger lunch parties often take place in the curved and domed Music Room or the State Dining Room. Since the bombing of the palace chapel in World War II, royal christenings have sometimes taken place in the Music Room. Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s first three children were all baptised there. On all formal occasions, the ceremonies are attended by the Yeomen of the Guard, in their historic uniforms, and other officers of the court such as the Lord Chamberlain.

===Former ceremonial===

====Court dress====

Formerly, men not wearing military uniform wore knee breeches of 18th-century design. Women&#x27;s evening dress included trains and tiaras or feathers in their hair (often both). The dress code governing formal court uniform and dress has progressively relaxed. After the First World War, when Queen Mary wished to follow fashion by raising her skirts a few inches from the ground, she requested a lady-in-waiting to shorten her own skirt first to gauge the King&#x27;s reaction. King George V disapproved, so the Queen kept her hemline unfashionably low. Following his accession in 1936, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth allowed the hemline of daytime skirts to rise. Today, there is no official dress code. Most men invited to Buckingham Palace in the daytime choose to wear service uniform or lounge suits; a minority wear morning coats, and in the evening, depending on the formality of the occasion, black tie or white tie.

====Court presentation of débutantes====
Débutantes were aristocratic young ladies making their first entrée into society through a presentation to the monarch at court. These occasions, known as &quot;coming out&quot;, took place at the palace from the reign of Edward VII. The débutantes entered—wearing full court dress, with three ostrich feathers in their hair—curtsied, performed a backwards walk and a further curtsey, while manoeuvring a dress train of prescribed length. The ceremony, known as an evening court, corresponded to the &quot;court drawing rooms&quot; of Victoria&#x27;s reign. After World War II, the ceremony was replaced by less formal afternoon receptions, omitting the requirement of court evening dress. In 1958, Queen Elizabeth II abolished the presentation parties for débutantes, replacing them with Garden Parties, for up to 8,000 invitees in the Garden. They are the largest functions of the year.

==Garden and surroundings==

At the rear of the palace is the large and park-like garden, which together with its lake is the largest private garden in London. There, Elizabeth II hosted her annual garden parties each summer and also held large functions to celebrate royal milestones, such as jubilees. It covers and includes a helicopter landing area, a lake and a tennis court.

Adjacent to the palace is the Royal Mews, also designed by Nash, where the royal carriages, including the Gold State Coach, are housed. This Rococo styled gilt coach, designed by William Chambers in 1760, has painted panels by Giovanni Battista Cipriani. It was first used for the State Opening of Parliament by George III in 1762 and has been used by the monarch for every coronation since William IV. It was last used for the coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla. Also housed in the mews are the coach horses used at royal ceremonial processions as well as many of the cars used by the royal family.

The Mall, a ceremonial approach route to the palace, was designed by Aston Webb and completed in 1911 as part of a grand memorial to Queen Victoria. It extends from Admiralty Arch, across St James&#x27;s Park to the Victoria Memorial, concluding at the entrance gates into the palace forecourt. This route is used by the cavalcades and motorcades of visiting heads of state, and by the royal family on state occasions—such as the annual Trooping the Colour.
==Security breaches==
The boy Jones was an intruder who gained entry to the palace on three occasions between 1838 and 1841. At least 12 people have managed to gain unauthorised entry into the palace or its grounds since 1914, including Michael Fagan, who broke into the palace twice in 1982 and entered Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s bedroom on the second occasion on 9 July. At the time, news media reported that he had a long conversation with her while she waited for security officers to arrive, but in a 2012 interview with &quot;The Independent&quot;, Fagan said she ran out of the room, and no conversation took place. It was only in 2007 that trespassing on the palace grounds became a specific criminal offence.

<text>British Airways plc (BA) is the flag carrier airline of the United Kingdom. It is headquartered in London, England, near its main hub at Heathrow Airport.

The airline is the second largest UK-based carrier, based on fleet size and passengers carried, behind easyJet. In January 2011, BA merged with Iberia, creating the International Airlines Group (IAG), a holding company registered in Madrid, Spain. IAG is the world&#x27;s third-largest airline group in terms of annual revenue and the second-largest in Europe. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and in the FTSE 100 Index. British Airways is the first passenger airline to have generated more than US$1 billion on a single air route in a year (from 1 April 2017, to 31 March 2018, on the New York-JFK – London-Heathrow route).

BA was created in 1974 after a British Airways Board was established by the British government to manage the two nationalised airline corporations, British Overseas Airways Corporation and British European Airways, and two regional airlines, Cambrian Airways and Northeast Airlines. On 31 March 1974, all four companies were merged to form British Airways. However, it marked 2019 as its centenary based on predecessor companies. After almost 13 years as a state company, BA was privatised in February 1987 as part of a wider privatisation plan by the Conservative government. The carrier expanded with the acquisition of British Caledonian in 1987, Dan-Air in 1992, and British Midland International in 2012.

It is a founding member of the Oneworld airline alliance, along with American Airlines, the now-defunct Canadian Airlines, Cathay Pacific, and Qantas. The alliance has since grown to become the third-largest, after SkyTeam and Star Alliance.

==History==

Proposals to establish a joint British airline, combining the assets of the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) and British European Airways (BEA), were first raised in 1953 as a result of difficulties in attempts by BOAC and BEA to negotiate air rights through the British colony of Cyprus. Increasingly BOAC was protesting that BEA was using its subsidiary Cyprus Airways to circumvent an agreement that BEA would not fly routes further east than Cyprus, particularly to the increasingly important oil regions in the Middle East. The chairman of BOAC, Miles Thomas, was in favour of a merger as a potential solution to this disagreement and had backing for the idea from the Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time, Rab Butler. However, opposition from the Treasury blocked the proposal.

Consequently, it was only following the recommendations of the 1969 Edwards Report that a new British Airways Board, managing both BEA and BOAC, and the two regional British airlines Cambrian Airways based at Cardiff, and Northeast Airlines based at Newcastle upon Tyne, was constituted on 1 April 1972. Although each airline&#x27;s branding was maintained initially, two years later the British Airways Board unified its branding, effectively establishing British Airways as an airline on 31 March 1974.

Following two years of fierce competition with British Caledonian, the second-largest airline in the United Kingdom at the time, the Government changed its aviation policy in 1976 so that the two carriers would no longer compete on long-haul routes.

British Airways and Air France operated the supersonic Concorde airliner, and the world&#x27;s first supersonic passenger service flew on 21 January 1976 from Heathrow Airport to Bahrain International Airport. Services to the U.S. began on 24 May 1976 with a flight to Washington Dulles airport, and flights to New York JFK airport followed on 22 September 1977. Service to Singapore was established in co-operation with Singapore Airlines as a continuation of the flight to Bahrain. Following the Air France Concorde crash in Paris and a slump in air travel following the 11 September attacks in New York in 2001, it was decided to cease Concorde operations in 2003 after 27 years of service. The final commercial Concorde flight was BA002 from New York-JFK to London-Heathrow on 24 October 2003.

In 1981 the airline was instructed to prepare for privatisation by the Conservative Thatcher government. Sir John King, later Lord King, was appointed chairman, charged with bringing the airline back into profitability. While many other large airlines struggled, King was credited with transforming British Airways into one of the most profitable air carriers in the world. The flag carrier was privatised and was floated on the London Stock Exchange in February 1987. British Airways effected the takeover of the UK&#x27;s &quot;second&quot; airline, British Caledonian, in July of that same year.

The formation of Richard Branson&#x27;s Virgin Atlantic in 1984 created a competitor for BA. The intense rivalry between British Airways and Virgin Atlantic culminated in the former being sued for libel in 1993, arising from claims and counterclaims over a &quot;dirty tricks&quot; campaign against Virgin. This campaign included allegations of poaching Virgin Atlantic customers, tampering with private files belonging to Virgin, and undermining Virgin&#x27;s financial reputation in the city. As a result of the case BA management apologised &quot;unreservedly&quot;, and the company agreed to pay £110,000 in damages to Virgin, £500,000 to Branson personally and £3 million legal costs. Lord King stepped down as chairman in 1993 and was replaced by his deputy, Colin Marshall, while Bob Ayling took over as CEO. Virgin filed a separate action in the U.S. that same year regarding BA&#x27;s domination of the trans-Atlantic routes, but it was thrown out in 1999.

In 1992 British Airways expanded through the acquisition of the financially troubled Dan-Air, giving BA a much larger presence at Gatwick Airport. British Asia Airways, a subsidiary based in Taiwan, was formed in March 1993 to operate between London and Taipei. That same month BA purchased a 25% stake in the Australian airline Qantas and, with the acquisition of Brymon Airways in May, formed British Airways Citiexpress (later BA Connect). In September 1998, British Airways, along with American Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Qantas, and Canadian Airlines, formed the Oneworld airline alliance. Oneworld began operations on 1 February 1999, and is the third-largest airline alliance in the world, behind SkyTeam and Star Alliance.

Bob Ayling&#x27;s leadership led to a cost savings of £750m and the establishment of a budget airline, Go, in 1998. The next year, however, British Airways reported an 84% drop in profits in its first quarter alone, its worst in seven years. In March 2000, Ayling was removed from his position and British Airways announced Rod Eddington as his successor. That year, British Airways and KLM conducted talks on a potential merger, reaching a decision in July to file an official merger plan with the European Commission. The plan fell through in September 2000. British Asia Airways ceased operations in 2001 after BA suspended flights to Taipei. Go was sold to its management and the private equity firm 3i in June 2001. Eddington would make further workforce cuts due to reduced demand following 11 September attacks in 2001, and BA sold its stake in Qantas in September 2004. In 2005 Willie Walsh, managing director of Aer Lingus and a former pilot, became the chief executive officer of British Airways. BA unveiled its new subsidiary OpenSkies in January 2008, taking advantage of the liberalisation of transatlantic traffic rights between Europe and the United States. OpenSkies flies non-stop from Paris to New York&#x27;s JFK and Newark airports.

In July 2008, British Airways announced a merger plan with Iberia, another flag carrier airline in the Oneworld alliance, wherein each airline would retain its original brand. The agreement was confirmed in April 2010, and in July the European Commission and U.S. Department of Transportation permitted the merger and began to co-ordinate transatlantic routes with American Airlines. On 6 October 2010 the alliance between British Airways, American Airlines and Iberia formally began operations. The alliance generates an estimated £230 million in annual cost-saving for BA, in addition to the £330 million which would be saved by the merger with Iberia. This merger was finalised on 21 January 2011, resulting in the establishment of International Airlines Group S.A. (IAG), the world&#x27;s third-largest airline in terms of annual revenue and the second-largest airline group in Europe. Prior to merging, British Airways owned a 13.5% stake in Iberia, and thus received ownership of 55% of the combined International Airlines Group; Iberia&#x27;s other shareholders received the remaining 45%. As a part of the merger, British Airways ceased trading independently on the London Stock Exchange after 23 years as a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.

In September 2010 Willie Walsh, now CEO of IAG, announced that the group was considering acquiring other airlines and had drawn up a shortlist of twelve possible acquisitions. In November 2011 IAG announced an agreement in principle to purchase British Midland International from Lufthansa. A contract to purchase the airline was agreed the next month, and the sale was completed for £172.5 million on 30 March 2012. The airline established a new subsidiary based at London City Airport operating Airbus A318s.

British Airways was the official airline partner of the London 2012 Olympic Games. On 18 May 2012 it flew the Olympic flame from Athens International Airport to RNAS Culdrose while carrying various dignitaries, including Lord Sebastian Coe, Princess Anne, the Olympics minister Hugh Robertson and the London Mayor Boris Johnson, along with the footballer David Beckham.

On 27 May 2017, British Airways suffered a computer power failure. All flights were cancelled and thousands of passengers were affected. By the following day, the company had not succeeded in reestablishing the normal function of its computer systems. When asked by reporters for more information on the ongoing problems, British Airways stated &quot;The root cause was a power supply issue which our affected our IT systems - we continue to investigate this&quot; and declined to comment further. Willie Walsh later attributed the crash to an electrical engineer disconnecting the UPS and said there would be an independent investigation.

Amidst the decline in the value of Iranian currency due to the reintroduction of U.S. sanctions on Iran, BA announced that the Iranian route is &quot;not commercially viable&quot;. As a result, BA decided to stop its services in Iran, effective 22 September 2018.

In 2018, British Airways partnered with British tailor and designer Ozwald Boateng to redesign the company&#x27;s historic uniforms, in honour of its approaching centenary, creating a new look for BA, while adhering to its traditional style. The new collection &quot;A British Original&quot; was launched in 2023. This design initiative also included English bone china manufactured by William Edwards and cutlery by Studio William for the company&#x27;s first class service.

In 2019, as part of the celebrations of a centenary of airline operations in the United Kingdom, British Airways announced that four aircraft would receive retro liveries. The first of these is a Boeing 747-400 (G-BYGC), which was repainted into the former BOAC livery, which it retained until its retirement. Two more Boeing 747-400s were repainted with former British Airways liveries. One wore the &quot;Landor&quot; livery until its retirement in 2020 (G-BNLY), the other (G-CIVB), wore the original &quot;Union Jack&quot; livery until its retirement in 2020 also. An Airbus A319 was repainted into British European Airways livery, which is still flying as G-EUPJ.

On 28 April 2020, the company set out plans to make up to 12,000 staff redundant because of the global collapse of air traffic due to the COVID-19 pandemic and that it may not reopen its operations at Gatwick airport. They reopened at Gatwick in March 2022.

In July 2020, British Airways announced the immediate retirement of its entire 747-400 fleet, having originally intended to phase out the remaining 747s in 2024. The airline stated that its decision to bring forward the date was in part due to the downturn in air travel following the COVID-19 pandemic and to focus on incorporating more modern and fuel-efficient aircraft such as the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787. At the same time, British Airways also announced its intention to eliminate carbon emissions by 2050. On 28 July 2020, the company&#x27;s cabin crew union issued an &quot;industrial action&quot; warning in order to prevent the 12,000 job cuts and pay cuts.

On 12 October 2020, it was announced that Sean Doyle, CEO of Aer Lingus (also part of the IAG airline group) would succeed Álex Cruz as CEO.

==Corporate affairs==
===Business trends===
The key trends for the British Airways PLC Group are shown below.

On the merger with Iberia, the accounting reference date was changed from 31 March to 31 December; figures below are therefore for the years to 31 March up to 2010, for the nine months to 31 December 2010, and for the years to 31 December thereafter:

In 2020, due to the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, British Airways had to reduce its 42,000-strong workforce by 12,000 jobs. According to the estimate by IAG, a parent company, it will take the air travel industry several years to return to previous performance and profitability levels.

However, 2022 saw a dramatic increase in travel, and the company now faced a worker shortage, forcing it to cancel more than 1,500 flights. During February 2023, The international airlines group, the owners of British Airways announced that the group has returned to making an annual profit of €1.3 billion for the first time since the pandemic, following a €2.8 billion loss in 2021. The company warned that due to the surge in demand for flying this could lead to more disruption.

===Operations===

British Airways is the largest airline based in the United Kingdom in terms of fleet size, international flights, and international destinations and was, until 2008, the largest airline by passenger numbers. The airline carried 34.6 million passengers in 2008, but, rival carrier easyJet transported 44.5 million passengers that year, passing British Airways for the first time. British Airways holds a United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority Type A Operating Licence, it is permitted to carry passengers, cargo, and mail on aircraft with 20 or more seats.

The airlines&#x27; head office, Waterside, stands in Harmondsworth, a village that is near Heathrow Airport. Waterside was completed in June 1998 to replace British Airways&#x27; previous head office, Speedbird House, located in Technical Block C on the grounds of Heathrow.

British Airways&#x27; main base is at Heathrow Airport, but it also has a major presence at Gatwick Airport. It also has a base at London City Airport, where its subsidiary BA CityFlyer is the largest operator. BA had previously operated a significant hub at Manchester Airport. Manchester to New York (JFK) services were withdrawn; later all international services outside London ceased when the subsidiary BA Connect was sold. Passengers wishing to travel internationally with BA either to or from regional UK destinations must now transfer in London. Heathrow Airport is dominated by British Airways, which owns 50% of the slots available at the airport as of 2019, growing from 40% in 2004. The majority of BA services operate from Terminal 5, with the exception of some flights at Terminal 3 owing to insufficient capacity at Terminal 5. At London City Airport, the company owns 52% of the slots as of 2019.

In August 2014, Willie Walsh advised the airline would continue to use flight paths over Iraq despite the hostilities there. A few days earlier Qantas announced it would avoid Iraqi airspace, while other airlines did likewise. The issue arose following the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine, and a temporary suspension of flights to and from Ben Gurion Airport during the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict.

===Subsidiaries===

Over its history, BA has had many subsidiaries. In addition to the below, British Airways also owned Airways Aero Association, the operator of the British Airways flying club based at Wycombe Air Park in High Wycombe, until it was sold to Surinder Arora in 2007.

===Franchises===


===Shareholdings===
British Airways obtained a 15% stake in UK regional airline Flybe from the sale of BA Connect in March 2007. It sold the stake in 2014.

BA also owned a 10% stake in InterCapital and Regional Rail (ICRR), the company that managed the operations of Eurostar (UK) Ltd from 1998 to 2010, when the management of Eurostar was restructured.

===Industrial relations===
Staff working for British Airways are represented by a number of trade unions, pilots are represented by British Air Line Pilots&#x27; Association, cabin crew by British Airlines Stewards and Stewardesses Association (a branch of Unite the Union), while other branches of Unite the Union and the GMB Union represent other employees. Bob Ayling&#x27;s management faced strike action by cabin crew over a £1 billion cost-cutting drive to return BA to profitability in 1997; this was the last time BA cabin crew would strike until 2009, although staff morale has reportedly been unstable since that incident. In an effort to increase interaction between management, employees, and the unions, various conferences and workshops have taken place, often with thousands in attendance.

In 2005, wildcat action was taken by union members over a decision by Gate Gourmet not to renew the contracts of 670 workers and replace them with agency staff; it is estimated that the strike cost British Airways £30 million and caused disruption to 100,000 passengers. In October 2006, BA became involved in a civil rights dispute when a Christian employee was forbidden to wear a necklace bearing the cross, a religious symbol. BA&#x27;s practice of forbidding such symbols has been publicly questioned by British politicians such as the former Home Secretary John Reid and the former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw.

Relations have been turbulent between BA and Unite. In 2007, cabin crew threatened strike action over salary changes to be imposed by BA management. The strike was called off at the last minute, British Airways losing £80 million. In December 2009, a ballot for strike action over Christmas received a high level of support, action was blocked by a court injunction that deemed the ballot illegal. Negotiations failed to stop strike action in March, BA withdrew perks for strike participants. Allegations were made by &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper that BA had consulted outside firms methods to undermine the unions: the story was later withdrawn. A strike was announced for May 2010, British Airways again sought an injunction. Members of the Socialist Workers Party disrupted negotiations between BA management and Unite to prevent industrial action. Further disruption struck when Derek Simpson, a Unite co-leader, was discovered to have leaked details of confidential negotiations online via Twitter. Industrial action re-emerged in 2017, this time by BA&#x27;s Mixed Fleet flight attendants, whom were employed on much less favorable pay and terms and conditions compared to previous cabin staff who joined prior to 2010. A ballot for industrial action was distributed to Mixed Fleet crew in November 2016 and resulted in an overwhelming yes majority for industrial action. Unite described Mixed Fleet crew as on &quot;poverty pay&quot;, with many Mixed Fleet flight attendants sleeping in their cars in between shifts because they cannot afford the fuel to drive home, or operating while sick as they cannot afford to call in sick and lose their pay for the shift. Unite also blasted BA of removing staff travel concessions, bonus payments and other benefits to all cabin crew who undertook industrial action, as well as strike-breaking tactics such as wet-leasing aircraft from other airlines and offering financial incentives for cabin crew not to strike. The first dates of strikes during Christmas 2016 were cancelled due to pay negotiations. Industrial action by Mixed Fleet commenced in January 2017 after rejecting a pay offer. Strike action continued throughout 2017 in numerous discontinuous periods, resulting in one of the longest running disputes in aviation history. On 31 October 2017, after 85 days of discontinuous industrial action, Mixed Fleet accepted a new pay deal from BA which ended the dispute.

The airline has its own engineering branch to maintain its aircraft fleet, this includes line maintenance at over 70 airports around the world. Amongst the company&#x27;s various hangar facilities are its two major maintenance centres at Glasgow and Cardiff Airports.

==Marketing==
===Branding===

The musical theme predominantly used on British Airways advertising has been &quot;The Flower Duet&quot; by Léo Delibes. This was first used in a 1984 advertisement directed by Tony Scott, in an arrangement by Howard Blake. It was reworked by Malcolm McLaren and Yanni for 1989&#x27;s iconic &quot;Face&quot; advertisement, and subsequently appeared in many different arrangements between 1990 and 2010. The slogan &#x27;the world&#x27;s favourite airline&#x27;, first used in 1983, was dropped in 2001 after Lufthansa overtook BA in terms of passenger numbers. Other advertising slogans have included &quot;The World&#x27;s Best Airline&quot;, &quot;We&#x27;ll Take More Care of You&quot;, &quot;Fly the Flag&quot;, and &quot;To Fly, To Serve&quot;.

BA had an account for 23 years with Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, an agency that created many of their most famous advertisements, including &quot;The World&#x27;s Biggest Offer&quot; and the influential &quot;Face&quot; campaign. Saatchi &amp; Saatchi later imitated this advert for Silverjet, a rival of BA, after BA discontinued their business activities. Since 2007, BA used Bartle Bogle Hegarty as its advertising agency.

In October 2022, BA launched a brand new ad campaign, titled &quot;A British Original&quot; produced by London-based Uncommon Creative Studio. This was to be another record-breaking campaign for its use of 500 unique executions along with a series of 32 short films, coinciding with the launch of Ozwald Boateng&#x27;s new collection of uniform.

British Airways purchased the internet domain ba.com in 2002 from previous owner Bell Atlantic, &#x27;BA&#x27; being the company&#x27;s initialism and its IATA Airline code.

British Airways is the official airline of the Wimbledon Championship tennis tournament, and was the official airline and tier one partner of the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics. BA was also the official airline of England&#x27;s bid to host the 2018 Football World Cup.

&quot;High Life&quot;, founded in 1973, is the official in-flight magazine of the airline.

===Safety video===
The airline used a cartoon safety video from circa 2005 until 2017. Beginning on 1 September 2017 the airline introduced the new Comic Relief live action safety video hosted by Chabuddy G, with appearances by British celebrities Gillian Anderson, Rowan Atkinson, Jim Broadbent, Rob Brydon, Warwick Davis, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Ian McKellen, Thandie Newton, and Gordon Ramsay. A &quot;sequel&quot; video, also hosted by Chabuddy G, was released in 2018, with Michael Caine, Olivia Colman, Jourdan Dunn, Naomie Harris, Joanna Lumley, and David Walliams. The two videos are part of Comic Relief&#x27;s charity programme. On 17 April 2023, the airline launched a new safety video as a part of “A British Original” campaign, with Emma Raducanu, Robert Peston, Little Simz, and Steven Bartlett.

===Liveries, logos, and tail fins===


The aeroplanes that British Airways inherited from the four-way merger between BOAC, BEA, Cambrian, and Northeast were temporarily given the text logo &quot;British airways&quot; but retained the original airline&#x27;s livery. With its formation in 1974, British Airways&#x27; aeroplanes were given a new white, blue, and red colour scheme with a cropped Union Jack painted on their tail fins, designed by Negus &amp; Negus. In 1984, a new livery designed by Landor Associates updated the airline&#x27;s look as it prepared for privatization. To celebrate its centenary in 2019, BA announced four retro liveries: three on Boeing 747-400 aircraft (one in each of BOAC, Negus &amp; Negus, and Landor Associates liveries), and one A319 in BEA livery.

In 1997, there was a controversial change to a new Project Utopia livery; all aircraft used the corporate colours consistently on the fuselage, but tailfins bore one of multiple designs. Several people spoke out against the change, including the former prime minister Margaret Thatcher, who famously covered the tail of a model 747 at an event with a handkerchief, to show her displeasure. BA&#x27;s traditional rival, Virgin Atlantic, took advantage of the negative press coverage by applying the Union flag to the winglets of their aircraft along with the slogan &quot;Britain&#x27;s national flagcarrier&quot;.

In 1999, the CEO of British Airways, Bob Ayling, announced that all BA planes would adopt the tailfin design &quot;Chatham Dockyard Union Flag&quot; originally intended to be used only on the Concorde, based on the Union Flag.
===Arms===
In 2011, British Airways made a brand relaunch project, in which BA introduced a stylised, metallic version of the arms by For People Design to be used along with its &quot;Speedmarque&quot; logo. This is used exclusively on aircraft, First Wing Lounge and advertisements.

In 2024, the damaged letters patent of the arms went up for auction online before being withdrawn.

===Loyalty programmes===
British Airways&#x27; tiered loyalty programme, called the Executive Club, includes access to special lounges and dedicated &quot;fast&quot; queues.

Members of the programme were also granted status within the Oneworld alliance, which permitted similar benefits when flying with Oneworld member airlines. The level of benefits were determined by the member&#x27;s tier.

The Executive Club is being rebranded to &quot;The British Airways Club&quot; starting 1 April 2025. The change means that you earn 1 tier point per £1 spent, with the new thresholds being set as the following:

Bronze: 3500 points

Silver: 7500 points

Gold: 20,000 points

==Incidents and accidents==
British Airways is known to have a strong reputation for safety and has been consistently ranked within the top 20 safest airlines globally according to &quot;Business Insider&quot; and &quot;AirlineRatings.com.&quot;

Since BA&#x27;s inception in 1974, it has been involved in three hull-loss incidents (British Airways Flight 149 was destroyed on the ground at Kuwait International Airport as a result of military action during the First Gulf War with no one on board) and two hijacking attempts. To date, the only fatal accident experienced by a BA aircraft occurred in 1976 with British Airways Flight 476 which was involved in a midair collision later attributed to an error made by air traffic control.

* On 22 November 1974, British Airways Flight 870 was hijacked shortly after take-off from Dubai International Airport for London-Heathrow. The Vickers VC10 landed at Tripoli for refuelling before flying on to Tunis. The captain, Jim Futcher, returned to the aircraft to fly it knowing the hijackers were on board. A hostage, 43-year-old German banker Werner Gustav Kehl, was shot in the back. The hijackers eventually surrendered after 84 hours. Futcher was awarded the Queen&#x27;s Gallantry Medal, the Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators Founders Medal, the British Air Line Pilots Association Gold Medal and a Certificate of Commendation from British Airways for his actions during the hijacking.
* On 10 September 1976, a Trident 3B on British Airways Flight 476 departed from London-Heathrow to Istanbul. It collided in mid-air with an Inex Adria DC9-31 near Zagreb. All 54 passengers and 9 crew members on the BA aircraft died. This is the only fatal accident to a British Airways aircraft since the company&#x27;s formation in 1974.
* On 24 June 1982, British Airways Flight 9, a Boeing 747-200 registration &quot;G-BDXH&quot;, flew through a cloud of volcanic ash and dust from the eruption of Mount Galunggung. The ash and dust caused extensive damage to the aircraft, including the failure of all four engines. The crew managed to glide the plane out of the dust cloud and restart all four of its engines, although one later had to be shut down again. The volcanic ash caused the cockpit window to be scratched to such an extent that it was difficult for the pilots to see out of the plane. However, the aircraft made a successful emergency landing at Halim Perdanakusuma International Airport just outside Jakarta. There were no fatalities or injuries.
* On 10 June 1990, British Airways Flight 5390, a BAC One-Eleven flight between Birmingham and Málaga, suffered a windscreen blowout due to the fitting of incorrect bolts the previous day. The captain sustained major injuries after being partially blown out of the aircraft, but the co-pilot landed the plane safely at Southampton Airport.
* On 2 August 1990, British Airways Flight 149 landed at Kuwait International Airport four hours after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. The aircraft, a Boeing 747-100 &quot;G-AWND&quot;, was destroyed, and all passengers and crew were captured. Two of the landing gears were salvaged, and are on display in Waterside, BA Headquarters in London.
* On 29 December 2000, British Airways Flight 2069 was en route from London to Nairobi when a mentally ill passenger entered the cockpit and grabbed the controls. As the pilots struggled to remove the intruder, the Boeing 747-400 stalled twice and banked to 94 degrees. Several people on board were injured by the violent manoeuvres, which briefly caused the aircraft to descend at 30,000 ft per minute. The man was finally restrained with the help of several passengers, and the co-pilot regained control of the aircraft. The flight landed safely in Nairobi.

* On 17 January 2008, British Airways Flight 38, a Boeing 777-200ER &quot;G-YMMM&quot;, from Beijing to London crash-landed approximately short of Heathrow Airport&#x27;s runway 27L, and slid onto the runway&#x27;s displaced threshold. The aircraft sustained damage to its landing gear, wing roots, and engines, resulting in the first hull loss of a Boeing 777. There were no fatalities, but there was one serious injury and 46 minor injuries. The accident was caused by icing in the fuel system, resulting in a loss of power.
* On 24 May 2013, British Airways Flight 762, using an Airbus A319-131 and registered as G-EUOE, returned to Heathrow Airport after fan cowl doors detached from both engines shortly after takeoff. During the approach, a fire broke out in the right engine and persisted after the engine was shut down. The aircraft landed safely with no injuries to the 80 people on board. The accident report revealed that the cowlings had been left unlatched following overnight maintenance. The separation of the doors caused airframe damage and the right-hand engine fire resulted from a ruptured fuel pipe.
* On 22 December 2013, British Airways Flight 34, a Boeing 747-436 &quot;G-BNLL&quot;, hit a building at O. R. Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg after missing a turning on a taxiway. The starboard wing was severely damaged but there were no injuries amongst the crew or 189 passengers, however, four members of ground staff were injured when the wing smashed into the building. The aircraft was officially withdrawn from service in February 2014.
* On 8 September 2015, British Airways Flight 2276, a Boeing 777-236ER &quot;G-VIIO&quot;, aborted its takeoff at Las Vegas&#x27; McCarran International Airport due to an uncontained engine failure of its left (#1) General Electric GE90 engine, which led to a substantial fire. The aircraft was evacuated on the main runway. All 157 passengers and 13 crew escaped the aircraft, at least 14 people sustaining minor injuries.
* Between 21 August 2018 and 5 September 2018, an attacker stole data for almost 500,000 British Airways customers, including credit card details for 250,000. The company was subsequently fined £20 million in October 2020, by the Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office, the highest ever fine handed by the ICO at the time of issuing.

<text>A bicycle, also called a pedal cycle, bike, push-bike or cycle, is a human-powered or motor-assisted, pedal-driven, single-track vehicle, with two wheels attached to a frame, one behind the other. A is called a cyclist, or bicyclist.

Bicycles were introduced in the 19th century in Europe. By the early 21st century there were more than 1 billion bicycles. There are many more bicycles than cars. Bicycles are the principal means of transport in many regions. They also provide a popular form of recreation, and have been adapted for use as children&#x27;s toys. Bicycles are used for fitness, military and police applications, courier services, bicycle racing, and artistic cycling.

The basic shape and configuration of a typical upright or &quot;safety&quot; bicycle, has changed little since the first chain-driven model was developed around 1885. However, many details have been improved, especially since the advent of modern materials and computer-aided design. These have allowed for a proliferation of specialized designs for many types of cycling. In the 21st century, electric bicycles have become popular.

The bicycle&#x27;s invention has had an enormous effect on society, both in terms of culture and of advancing modern industrial methods. Several components that played a key role in the development of the automobile were initially invented for use in the bicycle, including ball bearings, pneumatic tires, chain-driven sprockets, and tension-spoked wheels.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;bicycle&quot; first appeared in English print in &quot;The Daily News&quot; in 1868, to describe &quot;Bysicles and trysicles&quot; on the &quot;Champs Elysées and Bois de Boulogne&quot;. The word was first used in 1847 in a French publication to describe an unidentified two-wheeled vehicle, possibly a carriage. The design of the bicycle was an advance on the velocipede, although the words were used with some degree of overlap for a time.

Other words for bicycle include &quot;bike&quot;, &quot;pushbike&quot;, &quot;pedal cycle&quot;, or &quot;cycle&quot;. In Unicode, the code point for &quot;bicycle&quot; is 0x1F6B2. The entity codice_1 in HTML produces 🚲.

Although bike and cycle are used interchangeably to refer mostly to two types of two-wheelers, the terms still vary across the world. In India, for example, a cycle refers only to a two-wheeler using pedal power whereas the term bike is used to describe a two-wheeler using internal combustion engine or electric motors as a source of motive power instead of motorcycle/motorbike.

==History==
The &quot;dandy horse&quot;, also called &quot;Draisienne&quot; or &quot;Laufmaschine&quot; (&quot;running machine&quot;), was the first human means of transport to use only two wheels in tandem and was invented by the German Baron Karl von Drais. It is regarded as the first bicycle and von Drais is seen as the &quot;father of the bicycle&quot;, but it did not have pedals. Von Drais introduced it to the public in Mannheim in 1817 and in Paris in 1818. Its rider sat astride a wooden frame supported by two in-line wheels and pushed the vehicle along with his or her feet while steering the front wheel.

The first mechanically propelled, two-wheeled vehicle may have been built by Kirkpatrick MacMillan, a Scottish blacksmith, in 1839, although the claim is often disputed. He is also associated with the first recorded instance of a cycling traffic offense, when a Glasgow newspaper in 1842 reported an accident in which an anonymous &quot;gentleman from Dumfries-shire... bestride a velocipede... of ingenious design&quot; knocked over a little girl in Glasgow and was fined five shillings ().

In the early 1860s, Frenchmen Pierre Michaux and Pierre Lallement took bicycle design in a new direction by adding a mechanical crank drive with pedals on an enlarged front wheel (the velocipede). This was the first in mass production. Another French inventor named Douglas Grasso had a failed prototype of Pierre Lallement&#x27;s bicycle several years earlier. Several inventions followed using rear-wheel drive, the best known being the rod-driven velocipede by Scotsman Thomas McCall in 1869. In that same year, bicycle wheels with wire spokes were patented by Eugène Meyer of Paris. The French &quot;vélocipède&quot;, made of iron and wood, developed into the &quot;penny-farthing&quot; (historically known as an &quot;ordinary bicycle&quot;, a retronym, since there was then no other kind). It featured a tubular steel frame on which were mounted wire-spoked wheels with solid rubber tires. These bicycles were difficult to ride due to their high seat and poor weight distribution. In 1868 Rowley Turner, a sales agent of the Coventry Sewing Machine Company (which soon became the Coventry Machinists Company), brought a Michaux cycle to Coventry, England. His uncle, Josiah Turner, and business partner James Starley, used this as a basis for the &#x27;Coventry Model&#x27; in what became Britain&#x27;s first cycle factory.

The &quot;dwarf ordinary&quot; addressed some of these faults by reducing the front wheel diameter and setting the seat further back. This, in turn, required gearing—effected in a variety of ways—to efficiently use pedal power. Having to both pedal and steer via the front wheel remained a problem. Englishman J.K. Starley (nephew of James Starley), J.H. Lawson, and Shergold solved this problem by introducing the chain drive (originated by the unsuccessful &quot;bicyclette&quot; of Englishman Henry Lawson), connecting the frame-mounted cranks to the rear wheel. These models were known as safety bicycles, dwarf safeties, or upright bicycles for their lower seat height and better weight distribution, although without pneumatic tires the ride of the smaller-wheeled bicycle would be much rougher than that of the larger-wheeled variety. Starley&#x27;s 1885 Rover, manufactured in Coventry is usually described as the first recognizably modern bicycle. Soon the &quot;seat tube&quot; was added which created the modern bike&#x27;s double-triangle &quot;diamond frame&quot;.

Further innovations increased comfort and ushered in a second bicycle craze, the 1890s &quot;Golden Age of Bicycles&quot;. In 1888, Scotsman John Boyd Dunlop introduced the first practical pneumatic tire, which soon became universal. Willie Hume demonstrated the supremacy of Dunlop&#x27;s tyres in 1889, winning the tyre&#x27;s first-ever races in Ireland and then England. Soon after, the rear freewheel was developed, enabling the rider to coast. This refinement led to the 1890s invention of coaster brakes. Dérailleur gears and hand-operated Bowden cable-pull brakes were also developed during these years, but were only slowly adopted by casual riders.

The Svea Velocipede with vertical pedal arrangement and locking hubs was introduced in 1892 by the Swedish engineers Fredrik Ljungström and Birger Ljungström. It attracted attention at the World Fair and was produced in a few thousand units.

In the 1870s many cycling clubs flourished. They were popular in a time when there were no cars on the market and the principal mode of transportation was horse-drawn vehicles, such the horse and buggy or the horsecar. Among the earliest clubs was The Bicycle Touring Club, which has operated since 1878. By the turn of the century, cycling clubs flourished on both sides of the Atlantic, and touring and racing became widely popular. The Raleigh Bicycle Company was founded in Nottingham, England in 1888. It became the biggest bicycle manufacturing company in the world, making over two million bikes per year.

Bicycles and horse buggies were the two mainstays of private transportation just prior to the automobile, and the grading of smooth roads in the late 19th century was stimulated by the widespread advertising, production, and use of these devices. More than 1 billion bicycles have been manufactured worldwide as of the early 21st century. Bicycles are the most common vehicle of any kind in the world, and the most numerous model of any kind of vehicle, whether human-powered or motor vehicle, is the Chinese Flying Pigeon, with numbers exceeding 500 million. The next most numerous vehicle, the Honda Super Cub motorcycle, has more than 100 million units made, while most produced car, the Toyota Corolla, has reached 44 million and counting.

==Uses==
Bicycles are used for transportation, bicycle commuting, and utility cycling. They are also used professionally by mail carriers, paramedics, police, messengers, and general delivery services. Military uses of bicycles include communications, reconnaissance, troop movement, supply of provisions, and patrol, such as in bicycle infantries.

They are also used for recreational purposes, including bicycle touring, mountain biking, physical fitness, and play. Bicycle sports include racing, BMX racing, track racing, criterium, roller racing, sportives and time trials. Major multi-stage professional events are the Giro d&#x27;Italia, the Tour de France, the Vuelta a España, the Tour de Pologne, and the Volta a Portugal. They are also used for entertainment and pleasure in other ways, such as in organised mass rides, artistic cycling and freestyle BMX.

==Technical aspects==


The bicycle has undergone continual adaptation and improvement since its inception. These innovations have continued with the advent of modern materials and computer-aided design, allowing for a proliferation of specialized bicycle types, improved bicycle safety, and riding comfort.

===Types===

Bicycles can be categorized in many different ways: by function, by number of riders, by general construction, by gearing or by means of propulsion. The more common types include utility bicycles, mountain bicycles, racing bicycles, touring bicycles, hybrid bicycles, cruiser bicycles, and BMX bikes. Less common are tandems, low riders, tall bikes, fixed gear, folding models, amphibious bicycles, cargo bikes, recumbents and electric bicycles.

Unicycles, tricycles and quadracycles are not strictly bicycles, as they have respectively one, three and four wheels, but are often referred to informally as &quot;bikes&quot; or &quot;cycles&quot;.

===Dynamics===

A bicycle stays upright while moving forward by being steered so as to keep its center of mass over the wheels. This steering is usually provided by the rider, but under certain conditions may be provided by the bicycle itself.

The combined center of mass of a bicycle and its rider must lean into a turn to successfully navigate it. This lean is induced by a method known as countersteering, which can be performed by the rider turning the handlebars directly with the hands or indirectly by leaning the bicycle.

Short-wheelbase or tall bicycles, when braking, can generate enough stopping force at the front wheel to flip longitudinally. The act of purposefully using this force to lift the rear wheel and balance on the front without tipping over is a trick known as a stoppie, endo, or front wheelie.

===Performance===
The bicycle is extraordinarily efficient in both biological and mechanical terms. The bicycle is the most efficient human-powered means of transportation in terms of energy a person must expend to travel a given distance. From a mechanical viewpoint, up to 99% of the energy delivered by the rider into the pedals is transmitted to the wheels, although the use of gearing mechanisms may reduce this by 10–15%. In terms of the ratio of cargo weight a bicycle can carry to total weight, it is also an efficient means of cargo transportation.

A human traveling on a bicycle at low to medium speeds of around uses only the power required to walk. Air drag, which is proportional to the square of speed, requires dramatically higher power outputs as speeds increase. If the rider is sitting upright, the rider&#x27;s body creates about 75% of the total drag of the bicycle/rider combination. Drag can be reduced by seating the rider in a more aerodynamically streamlined position. Drag can also be reduced by covering the bicycle with an aerodynamic fairing. The fastest recorded unpaced speed on a flat surface is .

In addition, the carbon dioxide generated in the production and transportation of the food required by the bicyclist, per mile traveled, is less than that generated by energy efficient motorcars.
==Parts==
===Frame===
The great majority of modern bicycles have a frame with upright seating that looks much like the first chain-driven bike. These upright bicycles almost always feature the &quot;diamond frame&quot;, a truss consisting of two triangles: the front triangle and the rear triangle. The front triangle consists of the head tube, top tube, down tube, and seat tube. The head tube contains the headset, the set of bearings that allows the fork to turn smoothly for steering and balance. The top tube connects the head tube to the seat tube at the top, and the down tube connects the head tube to the bottom bracket. The rear triangle consists of the seat tube and paired chain stays and seat stays. The chain stays run parallel to the chain, connecting the bottom bracket to the rear dropout, where the axle for the rear wheel is held. The seat stays connect the top of the seat tube (at or near the same point as the top tube) to the rear fork ends.

Historically, women&#x27;s bicycle frames had a top tube that connected in the middle of the seat tube instead of the top, resulting in a lower standover height at the expense of compromised structural integrity, since this places a strong bending load in the seat tube, and bicycle frame members are typically weak in bending. This design, referred to as a &quot;step-through frame&quot; or as an &quot;open frame&quot;, allows the rider to mount and dismount in a dignified way while wearing a skirt or dress. While some women&#x27;s bicycles continue to use this frame style, there is also a variation, the &quot;mixte&quot;, which splits the top tube laterally into two thinner top tubes that bypass the seat tube on each side and connect to the rear fork ends. The ease of stepping through is also appreciated by those with limited flexibility or other joint problems. Because of its persistent image as a &quot;women&#x27;s&quot; bicycle, step-through frames are not common for larger frames.

Step-throughs were popular partly for practical reasons and partly for social mores of the day. For most of the history of bicycles&#x27; popularity women have worn long skirts, and the lower frame accommodated these better than the top-tube. Furthermore, it was considered &quot;unladylike&quot; for women to open their legs to mount and dismount—in more conservative times women who rode bicycles at all were vilified as immoral or immodest. These practices were akin to the older practice of riding horse sidesaddle.

Another style is the recumbent bicycle. These are inherently more aerodynamic than upright versions, as the rider may lean back onto a support and operate pedals that are on about the same level as the seat. The world&#x27;s fastest bicycle is a recumbent bicycle but this type was banned from competition in 1934 by the Union Cycliste Internationale.

Historically, materials used in bicycles have followed a similar pattern as in aircraft, the goal being high strength and low weight. Since the late 1930s alloy steels have been used for frame and fork tubes in higher quality machines. By the 1980s aluminum welding techniques had improved to the point that aluminum tube could safely be used in place of steel. Since then aluminum alloy frames and other components have become popular due to their light weight, and most mid-range bikes are now principally aluminum alloy of some kind. More expensive bikes use carbon fibre due to its significantly lighter weight and profiling ability, allowing designers to make a bike both stiff and compliant by manipulating the lay-up. Virtually all professional racing bicycles now use carbon fibre frames, as they have the best strength to weight ratio. A typical modern carbon fiber frame can weigh less than .

Other exotic frame materials include titanium and advanced alloys. Bamboo, a natural composite material with high strength-to-weight ratio and stiffness has been used for bicycles since 1894. Recent versions use bamboo for the primary frame with glued metal connections and parts, priced as exotic models.

===Drivetrain and gearing===
The &quot;drivetrain&quot; begins with pedals which rotate the cranks, which are held in axis by the bottom bracket. Most bicycles use a chain to transmit power to the rear wheel. A very small number of bicycles use a shaft drive to transmit power, or special belts. Hydraulic bicycle transmissions have been built, but they are currently inefficient and complex.

Since cyclists&#x27; legs are most efficient over a narrow range of pedaling speeds, or cadence, a variable gear ratio helps a cyclist to maintain an optimum pedalling speed while covering varied terrain. Some, mainly utility, bicycles use hub gears with between 3 and 14 ratios, but most use the generally more efficient dérailleur system, by which the chain is moved between different cogs called chainrings and sprockets to select a ratio. A dérailleur system normally has two dérailleurs, or mechs, one at the front to select the chainring and another at the back to select the sprocket. Most bikes have two or three chainrings, and from 5 to 12 sprockets on the back, with the number of theoretical gears calculated by multiplying front by back. In reality, many gears overlap or require the chain to run diagonally, so the number of usable gears is fewer.

An alternative to chaindrive is to use a synchronous belt. These are toothed and work much the same as a chain—popular with commuters and long distance cyclists they require little maintenance. They cannot be shifted across a cassette of sprockets, and are used either as single speed or with a hub gear.

Different gears and ranges of gears are appropriate for different people and styles of cycling. Multi-speed bicycles allow gear selection to suit the circumstances: a cyclist could use a high gear when cycling downhill, a medium gear when cycling on a flat road, and a low gear when cycling uphill. In a lower gear every turn of the pedals leads to fewer rotations of the rear wheel. This allows the energy required to move the same distance to be distributed over more pedal turns, reducing fatigue when riding uphill, with a heavy load, or against strong winds. A higher gear allows a cyclist to make fewer pedal turns to maintain a given speed, but with more effort per turn of the pedals.

With a &quot;chain drive&quot; transmission, a &quot;chainring&quot; attached to a crank drives the chain, which in turn rotates the rear wheel via the rear sprocket(s) (cassette or freewheel). There are four gearing options: two-speed hub gear integrated with chain ring, up to 3 chain rings, up to 12 sprockets, hub gear built into rear wheel (3-speed to 14-speed). The most common options are either a rear hub or multiple chain rings combined with multiple sprockets (other combinations of options are possible but less common).

===Steering===

The handlebars connect to the stem that connects to the fork that connects to the front wheel, and the whole assembly connects to the bike and rotates about the steering axis via the headset bearings. Three styles of handlebar are common. &quot;Upright handlebars&quot;, the norm in Europe and elsewhere until the 1970s, curve gently back toward the rider, offering a natural grip and comfortable upright position. &quot;Drop handlebars&quot; &quot;drop&quot; as they curve forward and down, offering the cyclist best braking power from a more aerodynamic &quot;crouched&quot; position, as well as more upright positions in which the hands grip the brake lever mounts, the forward curves, or the upper flat sections for increasingly upright postures. Mountain bikes generally feature a &#x27;straight handlebar&#x27; or &#x27;riser bar&#x27; with varying degrees of sweep backward and centimeters rise upwards, as well as wider widths which can provide better handling due to increased leverage against the wheel.

===Seating===

Saddles also vary with rider preference, from the cushioned ones favored by short-distance riders to narrower saddles which allow more room for leg swings. Comfort depends on riding position. With comfort bikes and hybrids, cyclists sit high over the seat, their weight directed down onto the saddle, such that a wider and more cushioned saddle is preferable. For racing bikes where the rider is bent over, weight is more evenly distributed between the handlebars and saddle, the hips are flexed, and a narrower and harder saddle is more efficient. Differing saddle designs exist for male and female cyclists, accommodating the genders&#x27; differing anatomies and sit bone width measurements, although bikes typically are sold with saddles most appropriate for men. Suspension seat posts and seat springs provide comfort by absorbing shock but can add to the overall weight of the bicycle.

A recumbent bicycle has a reclined chair-like seat that some riders find more comfortable than a saddle, especially riders who suffer from certain types of seat, back, neck, shoulder, or wrist pain. Recumbent bicycles may have either under-seat or over-seat steering.

===Brakes===
Bicycle brakes may be rim brakes, in which friction pads are compressed against the wheel rims; hub brakes, where the mechanism is contained within the wheel hub, or disc brakes, where pads act on a rotor attached to the hub. Most road bicycles use rim brakes, but some use disc brakes. Disc brakes are more common for mountain bikes, tandems and recumbent bicycles than on other types of bicycles, due to their increased power, coupled with an increased weight and complexity.
With hand-operated brakes, force is applied to brake levers mounted on the handlebars and transmitted via Bowden cables or hydraulic lines to the friction pads, which apply pressure to the braking surface, causing friction which slows the bicycle down. A rear hub brake may be either hand-operated or pedal-actuated, as in the back pedal &quot;coaster brakes&quot; which were popular in North America until the 1960s.

Track bicycles do not have brakes, because all riders ride in the same direction around a track which does not necessitate sharp deceleration. Track riders are still able to slow down because all track bicycles are fixed-gear, meaning that there is no freewheel. Without a freewheel, coasting is impossible, so when the rear wheel is moving, the cranks are moving. To slow down, the rider applies resistance to the pedals, acting as a braking system which can be as effective as a conventional rear wheel brake, but not as effective as a front wheel brake.

===Suspension===
Bicycle suspension refers to the system or systems used to &quot;suspend&quot; the rider and all or part of the bicycle. This serves two purposes: to keep the wheels in continuous contact with the ground, improving control, and to isolate the rider and luggage from jarring due to rough surfaces, improving comfort.

Bicycle suspensions are used primarily on mountain bicycles, but are also common on hybrid bicycles, as they can help deal with problematic vibration from poor surfaces. Suspension is especially important on recumbent bicycles, since while an upright bicycle rider can stand on the pedals to achieve some of the benefits of suspension, a recumbent rider cannot.

Basic mountain bicycles and hybrids usually have front suspension only, whilst more sophisticated ones also have rear suspension. Road bicycles tend to have no suspension.

===Wheels and tires===
The wheel axle fits into fork ends in the frame and fork. A pair of wheels may be called a wheelset, especially in the context of ready-built &quot;off the shelf&quot;, performance-oriented wheels.

Tires vary enormously depending on their intended purpose. Road bicycles use tires 18 to 25 millimeters wide, most often completely smooth, or slick, and inflated to high pressure to roll fast on smooth surfaces. Off-road tires are usually between wide, and have treads for gripping in muddy conditions or metal studs for ice.

===Groupset===
Groupset generally refers to all of the components that make up a bicycle excluding the bicycle frame, fork, stem, wheels, tires, and rider contact points, such as the saddle and handlebars.

===Accessories===
Some components, which are often optional accessories on sports bicycles, are standard features on utility bicycles to enhance their usefulness, comfort, safety and visibility. Fenders with spoilers (mudflaps) protect the cyclist and moving parts from spray when riding through wet areas. In some countries (e.g. Germany, UK), fenders are called mudguards. The chainguards protect clothes from oil on the chain while preventing clothing from being caught between the chain and crankset teeth. Kick stands keep bicycles upright when parked, and bike locks deter theft. Front-mounted baskets, front or rear luggage carriers or racks, and panniers mounted above either or both wheels can be used to carry equipment or cargo. Pegs can be fastened to one, or both of the wheel hubs to either help the rider perform certain tricks, or allow a place for extra riders to stand, or rest. Parents sometimes add rear-mounted child seats, an auxiliary saddle fitted to the crossbar, or both to transport children. Bicycles can also be fitted with a hitch to tow a trailer for carrying cargo, a child, or both.

Toe-clips and toestraps and clipless pedals help keep the foot locked in the proper pedal position and enable cyclists to pull and push the pedals. Technical accessories include cyclocomputers for measuring speed, distance, heart rate, GPS data etc. Other accessories include lights, reflectors, mirrors, racks, trailers, bags, water bottles and cages, and bell. Bicycle lights, reflectors, and helmets are required by law in some geographic regions depending on the legal code. It is more common to see bicycles with bottle generators, dynamos, lights, fenders, racks and bells in Europe. Bicyclists also have specialized form fitting and high visibility clothing.

Children&#x27;s bicycles may be outfitted with cosmetic enhancements such as bike horns, streamers, and spoke beads. Training wheels are sometimes used when learning to ride, but a dedicated balance bike teaches independent riding more effectively.

Bicycle helmets can reduce injury in the event of a collision or accident, and a suitable helmet is legally required of riders in many jurisdictions. Helmets may be classified as an accessory or as an item of clothing.

Bike trainers are used to enable cyclists to cycle while the bike remains stationary. They are frequently used to warm up before races or indoors when riding conditions are unfavorable.

=== Standards ===
A number of formal and industry standards exist for bicycle components to help make spare parts exchangeable and to maintain a minimum product safety.

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has a special technical committee for cycles, TC149, that has the scope of &quot;Standardization in the field of cycles, their components and accessories with particular reference to terminology, testing methods and requirements for performance and safety, and interchangeability&quot;.

The European Committee for Standardization (CEN) also has a specific Technical Committee, TC333, that defines European standards for cycles. Their mandate states that EN cycle standards shall harmonize with ISO standards. Some CEN cycle standards were developed before ISO published their standards, leading to strong European influences in this area. European cycle standards tend to describe minimum safety requirements, while ISO standards have historically harmonized parts geometry.

==Maintenance and repair==
Like all devices with mechanical moving parts, bicycles require a certain amount of regular maintenance and replacement of worn parts. A bicycle is relatively simple compared with a car, so some cyclists choose to do at least part of the maintenance themselves. Some components are easy to handle using relatively simple tools, while other components may require specialist manufacturer-dependent tools.

Many bicycle components are available at several different price/quality points; manufacturers generally try to keep all components on any particular bike at about the same quality level, though at the very cheap end of the market there may be some skimping on less obvious components (e.g. bottom bracket).
* There are several hundred assisted-service Community Bicycle Organizations worldwide. At a Community Bicycle Organization, bring in bicycles needing repair or maintenance; volunteers teach them how to do the required steps.
* Full service is available from bicycle mechanics at a local bike shop.
* In areas where it is available, some cyclists purchase roadside assistance from companies such as the Better World Club or the American Automobile Association.

===Maintenance===
The most basic maintenance item is keeping the tires correctly inflated; this can make a noticeable difference as to how the bike feels to ride. Bicycle tires usually have a marking on the sidewall indicating the pressure appropriate for that tire. Bicycles use much higher pressures than cars: car tires are normally in the range of , whereas bicycle tires are normally in the range of .

Another basic maintenance item is regular lubrication of the chain and pivot points for derailleurs and brake components. Most of the bearings on a modern bike are sealed and grease-filled and require little or no attention; such bearings will usually last for or more. The crank bearings require periodic maintenance, which involves removing, cleaning and repacking with the correct grease.

The chain and the brake blocks are the components which wear out most quickly, so these need to be checked from time to time, typically every or so. Most local bike shops will do such checks for free. Note that when a chain becomes badly worn it will also wear out the rear cogs/cassette and eventually the chain ring(s), so replacing a chain when only moderately worn will prolong the life of other components.

Over the longer term, tires do wear out, after ; a rash of punctures is often the most visible sign of a worn tire.

===Repair===
Very few bicycle components can actually be repaired; replacement of the failing component is the normal practice.

The most common roadside problem is a puncture of the tire&#x27;s inner tube. A patch kit may be employed to fix the puncture or the tube can be replaced, though the latter solution comes at a greater cost and waste of material. Some brands of tires are much more puncture-resistant than others, often incorporating one or more layers of Kevlar; the downside of such tires is that they may be heavier and/or more difficult to fit and remove.

===Tools===

There are specialized bicycle tools for use both in the shop and at the roadside. Many cyclists carry tool kits. These may include a tire patch kit (which, in turn, may contain any combination of a hand pump or CO2 pump, tire levers, spare tubes, self-adhesive patches, or tube-patching material, an adhesive, a piece of sandpaper or a metal grater (for roughening the tube surface to be patched) and sometimes even a block of French chalk), wrenches, hex keys, screwdrivers, and a chain tool. Special, thin wrenches are often required for maintaining various screw-fastened parts, specifically, the frequently lubricated ball-bearing &quot;cones&quot;. There are also cycling-specific multi-tools that combine many of these implements into a single compact device. More specialized bicycle components may require more complex tools, including proprietary tools specific for a given manufacturer.

==Social and historical aspects==
The bicycle has had a considerable effect on human society, in both the cultural and industrial realms.

===In daily life===
Around the turn of the 20th century, bicycles reduced crowding in inner-city tenements by allowing workers to commute from more spacious dwellings in the suburbs. They also reduced dependence on horses. Bicycles allowed people to travel for leisure into the country, since bicycles were three times as energy efficient as walking and three to four times as fast.
In built-up cities around the world, urban planning uses cycling infrastructure like bikeways to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution. A number of cities around the world have implemented schemes known as bicycle sharing systems or community bicycle programs. The first of these was the White Bicycle plan in Amsterdam in 1965. It was followed by yellow bicycles in La Rochelle and green bicycles in Cambridge. These initiatives complement public transport systems and offer an alternative to motorized traffic to help reduce congestion and pollution. In Europe, especially in the Netherlands and parts of Germany and Denmark, bicycle commuting is common. In Copenhagen, a cyclists&#x27; organization runs a Cycling Embassy that promotes biking for commuting and sightseeing. The United Kingdom has a tax break scheme (IR 176) that allows employees to buy a new bicycle tax free to use for commuting.

In the Netherlands all train stations offer free bicycle parking, or a more secure parking place for a small fee, with the larger stations also offering bicycle repair shops. Cycling is so popular that the parking capacity may be exceeded, while in some places such as Delft the capacity is usually exceeded. In Trondheim in Norway, the Trampe bicycle lift has been developed to encourage cyclists by giving assistance on a steep hill. Buses in many cities have bicycle carriers mounted on the front.

There are towns in some countries where bicycle culture has been an integral part of the landscape for generations, even without much official support. That is the case of Ílhavo, in Portugal.

In cities where bicycles are not integrated into the public transportation system, commuters often use bicycles as elements of a mixed-mode commute, where the bike is used to travel to and from train stations or other forms of rapid transit. Some students who commute several miles drive a car from home to a campus parking lot, then ride a bicycle to class. Folding bicycles are useful in these scenarios, as they are less cumbersome when carried aboard. Los Angeles removed a small amount of seating on some trains to make more room for bicycles and wheel chairs.
Some US companies, notably in the tech sector, are developing both innovative cycle designs and cycle-friendliness in the workplace. Foursquare, whose CEO Dennis Crowley &quot;pedaled to pitch meetings ... [when he] was raising money from venture capitalists&quot; on a two-wheeler, chose a new location for its New York headquarters &quot;based on where biking would be easy&quot;. Parking in the office was also integral to HQ planning. Mitchell Moss, who runs the Rudin Center for Transportation Policy &amp; Management at New York University, said in 2012: &quot;Biking has become the mode of choice for the educated high tech worker&quot;.

Bicycles offer an important mode of transport in many developing countries. Until recently, bicycles have been a staple of everyday life throughout Asian countries. They are the most frequently used method of transport for commuting to work, school, shopping, and life in general. In Europe, bicycles are commonly used. They also offer a degree of exercise to keep individuals healthy.

Bicycles are also celebrated in the visual arts. An example of this is the Bicycle Film Festival, a film festival hosted all around the world.

===Poverty alleviation===
===Female emancipation===
The safety bicycle gave women unprecedented mobility, contributing to their emancipation in Western nations. As bicycles became safer and cheaper, more women had access to the personal freedom that bicycles embodied, and so the bicycle came to symbolize the New Woman of the late 19th century, especially in Britain and the United States. The bicycle craze in the 1890s also led to a movement for so-called rational dress, which helped liberate women from corsets and ankle-length skirts and other restrictive garments, substituting the then-shocking bloomers.

The bicycle was recognized by 19th-century feminists and suffragists as a &quot;freedom machine&quot; for women. American Susan B. Anthony said in a &quot;New York World&quot; interview on 2 February 1896: &quot;I think it has done more to emancipate woman than any one thing in the world. I rejoice every time I see a woman ride by on a wheel. It gives her a feeling of self-reliance and independence the moment she takes her seat; and away she goes, the picture of untrammelled womanhood.&quot; In 1895 Frances Willard, the tightly laced president of the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union, wrote &quot;A Wheel Within a Wheel: How I Learned to Ride the Bicycle, with Some Reflections by the Way&quot;, a 75-page illustrated memoir praising &quot;Gladys&quot;, her bicycle, for its &quot;gladdening effect&quot; on her health and political optimism. Willard used a cycling metaphor to urge other suffragists to action.

In 1985, Georgena Terry started the first women-specific bicycle company. Her designs featured frame geometry and wheel sizes chosen to better fit women, with shorter top tubes and more suitable reach.

===Economic implications===
Bicycle manufacturing proved to be a training ground for other industries and led to the development of advanced metalworking techniques, both for the frames themselves and for special components such as ball bearings, washers, and sprockets. These techniques later enabled skilled metalworkers and mechanics to develop the components used in early automobiles and aircraft.

Wilbur and Orville Wright, a pair of businessmen, ran the Wright Cycle Company which designed, manufactured and sold their bicycles during the bike boom of the 1890s.

They also served to teach the industrial models later adopted, including mechanization and mass production (later copied and adopted by Ford and General Motors), vertical integration (also later copied and adopted by Ford), aggressive advertising (as much as 10% of all advertising in U.S. periodicals in 1898 was by bicycle makers), lobbying for better roads (which had the side benefit of acting as advertising, and of improving sales by providing more places to ride), all first practiced by Pope. In addition, bicycle makers adopted the annual model change (later derided as planned obsolescence, and usually credited to General Motors), which proved very successful.

Early bicycles were an example of conspicuous consumption, being adopted by the fashionable elites. In addition, by serving as a platform for accessories, which could ultimately cost more than the bicycle itself, it paved the way for the likes of the Barbie doll.

Bicycles helped create, or enhance, new kinds of businesses, such as bicycle messengers, traveling seamstresses, riding academies, and racing rinks. Their board tracks were later adapted to early motorcycle and automobile racing. There were a variety of new inventions, such as spoke tighteners, and specialized lights, socks and shoes, and even cameras, such as the Eastman Company&#x27;s Poco. Probably the best known and most widely used of these inventions, adopted well beyond cycling, is Charles Bennett&#x27;s Bike Web, which came to be called the jock strap.
They also presaged a move away from public transit that would explode with the introduction of the automobile.

J. K. Starley&#x27;s company became the Rover Cycle Company Ltd. in the late 1890s, and then renamed the Rover Company when it started making cars. Morris Motors Limited (in Oxford) and Škoda also began in the bicycle business, as did the Wright brothers. Alistair Craig, whose company eventually emerged to become the engine manufacturers Ailsa Craig, also started from manufacturing bicycles, in Glasgow in March 1885.

In general, U.S. and European cycle manufacturers used to assemble cycles from their own frames and components made by other companies, although very large companies (such as Raleigh) used to make almost every part of a bicycle (including bottom brackets, axles, etc.) In recent years, those bicycle makers have greatly changed their methods of production. Now, almost none of them produce their own frames.

Many newer or smaller companies only design and market their products; the actual production is done by Asian companies. For example, some 60% of the world&#x27;s bicycles are now being made in China. Despite this shift in production, as nations such as China and India become more wealthy, their own use of bicycles has declined due to the increasing affordability of cars and motorcycles. One of the major reasons for the proliferation of Chinese-made bicycles in foreign markets is the lower cost of labor in China.

In line with the European financial crisis of that time, in 2011 the number of bicycle sales in Italy (1.75 million) passed the number of new car sales.

===Environmental impact===
One of the profound economic implications of bicycle use is that it liberates the user from motor fuel consumption. (Ballantine, 1972) The bicycle is an inexpensive, fast, healthy and environmentally friendly mode of transport. Ivan Illich stated that bicycle use extended the usable physical environment for people, while alternatives such as cars and motorways degraded and confined people&#x27;s environment and mobility. Currently, two billion bicycles are in use around the world. Children, students, professionals, laborers, civil servants and seniors are pedaling around their communities. They all experience the freedom and the natural opportunity for exercise that the bicycle easily provides. Bicycle also has lowest carbon intensity of travel.

===Manufacturing===
The global bicycle market is $61 billion in 2011. , 130 million bicycles were sold every year globally and 66% of them were made in China.

===Legal requirements===
Early in its development, as with automobiles, there were restrictions on the operation of bicycles. Along with advertising, and to gain free publicity, Albert A. Pope litigated on behalf of cyclists.

The 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic of the United Nations considers a bicycle to be a vehicle, and a person controlling a bicycle (whether actually riding or not) is considered an operator or driver. The traffic codes of many countries reflect these definitions and demand that a bicycle satisfy certain legal requirements before it can be used on public roads. In many jurisdictions, it is an offense to use a bicycle that is not in a roadworthy condition.

In some countries, bicycles must have functioning front and rear lights when ridden after dark.

Some countries require child and/or adult cyclists to wear helmets, as this may protect riders from head trauma. Countries which require adult cyclists to wear helmets include Spain, New Zealand and Australia. Mandatory helmet wearing is one of the most controversial topics in the cycling world, with proponents arguing that it reduces head injuries and thus is an acceptable requirement, while opponents argue that by making cycling seem more dangerous and cumbersome, it reduces cyclist numbers on the streets, creating an overall negative health effect (fewer people cycling for their own health, and the remaining cyclists being more exposed through a reversed safety in numbers effect).

===Theft===

Bicycles are popular targets for theft, due to their value and ease of resale. The number of bicycles stolen annually is difficult to quantify as a large number of crimes are not reported. Around 50% of the participants in the Montreal International Journal of Sustainable Transportation survey were subjected to a bicycle theft in their lifetime as active cyclists. Most bicycles have serial numbers that can be recorded to verify identity in case of theft.

<text>Biopolymers are natural polymers produced by the cells of living organisms. Like other polymers, biopolymers consist of monomeric units that are covalently bonded in chains to form larger molecules. There are three main classes of biopolymers, classified according to the monomers used and the structure of the biopolymer formed: polynucleotides, polypeptides, and polysaccharides. The Polynucleotides, RNA and DNA, are long polymers of nucleotides. Polypeptides include proteins and shorter polymers of amino acids; some major examples include collagen, actin, and fibrin. Polysaccharides are linear or branched chains of sugar carbohydrates; examples include starch, cellulose, and alginate. Other examples of biopolymers include natural rubbers (polymers of isoprene), suberin and lignin (complex polyphenolic polymers), cutin and cutan (complex polymers of long-chain fatty acids), melanin, and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs).

In addition to their many essential roles in living organisms, biopolymers have applications in many fields including the food industry, manufacturing, packaging, and biomedical engineering.
== Biopolymers versus synthetic polymers ==

A major defining difference between biopolymers and synthetic polymers can be found in their structures. All polymers are made of repetitive units called monomers. Biopolymers often have a well-defined structure, though this is not a defining characteristic (example: lignocellulose): The exact chemical composition and the sequence in which these units are arranged is called the primary structure, in the case of proteins. Many biopolymers spontaneously fold into characteristic compact shapes (see also &quot;protein folding&quot; as well as secondary structure and tertiary structure), which determine their biological functions and depend in a complicated way on their primary structures. Structural biology is the study of the structural properties of biopolymers. In contrast, most synthetic polymers have much simpler and more random (or stochastic) structures. This fact leads to a molecular mass distribution that is missing in biopolymers. In fact, as their synthesis is controlled by a template-directed process in most &quot;in vivo&quot; systems, all biopolymers of a type (say one specific protein) are all alike: they all contain similar sequences and numbers of monomers and thus all have the same mass. This phenomenon is called monodispersity in contrast to the polydispersity encountered in synthetic polymers. As a result, biopolymers have a dispersity of 1.

== Conventions and nomenclature ==

=== Polypeptides ===

The convention for a polypeptide is to list its constituent amino acid residues as they occur from the amino terminus to the carboxylic acid terminus. The amino acid residues are always joined by peptide bonds. Protein, though used colloquially to refer to any polypeptide, refers to larger or fully functional forms and can consist of several polypeptide chains as well as single chains. Proteins can also be modified to include non-peptide components, such as saccharide chains and lipids.

=== Nucleic acids ===
The convention for a nucleic acid sequence is to list the nucleotides as they occur from the 5&#x27; end to the 3&#x27; end of the polymer chain, where 5&#x27; and 3&#x27; refer to the numbering of carbons around the ribose ring which participate in forming the phosphate diester linkages of the chain. Such a sequence is called the primary structure of the biopolymer.

=== Polysaccharides ===
Polysaccharides (sugar polymers) can be linear or branched and are typically joined with glycosidic bonds. The exact placement of the linkage can vary, and the orientation of the linking functional groups is also important, resulting in α- and β-glycosidic bonds with numbering definitive of the linking carbons&#x27; location in the ring. In addition, many saccharide units can undergo various chemical modifications, such as amination, and can even form parts of other molecules, such as glycoproteins.

== Structural characterization ==
There are a number of biophysical techniques for determining sequence information. Protein sequence can be determined by Edman degradation, in which the N-terminal residues are hydrolyzed from the chain one at a time, derivatized, and then identified. Mass spectrometer techniques can also be used. Nucleic acid sequence can be determined using gel electrophoresis and capillary electrophoresis. Lastly, mechanical properties of these biopolymers can often be measured using optical tweezers or atomic force microscopy. Dual-polarization interferometry can be used to measure the conformational changes or self-assembly of these materials when stimulated by pH, temperature, ionic strength or other binding partners.

== Common biopolymers ==
Collagen: Collagen is the primary structure of vertebrates and is the most abundant protein in mammals. Because of this, collagen is one of the most easily attainable biopolymers, and used for many research purposes. Because of its mechanical structure, collagen has high tensile strength and is a non-toxic, easily absorbable, biodegradable, and biocompatible material. Therefore, it has been used for many medical applications such as in treatment for tissue infection, drug delivery systems, and gene therapy.

Silk fibroin: Silk Fibroin (SF) is another protein rich biopolymer that can be obtained from different silkworm species, such as the mulberry worm Bombyx mori. In contrast to collagen, SF has a lower tensile strength but has strong adhesive properties due to its insoluble and fibrous protein composition. In recent studies, silk fibroin has been found to possess anticoagulation properties and platelet adhesion. Silk fibroin has been additionally found to support stem cell proliferation in vitro.

Gelatin: Gelatin is obtained from type I collagen consisting of cysteine, and produced by the partial hydrolysis of collagen from bones, tissues and skin of animals. There are two types of gelatin, Type A and Type B. Type A collagen is derived by acid hydrolysis of collagen and has 18.5% nitrogen. Type B is derived by alkaline hydrolysis containing 18% nitrogen and no amide groups. Elevated temperatures cause the gelatin to melts and exists as coils, whereas lower temperatures result in coil to helix transformation. Gelatin contains many functional groups like NH2, SH, and COOH which allow for gelatin to be modified using nanoparticles and biomolecules. Gelatin is an Extracellular Matrix protein which allows it to be applied for applications such as wound dressings, drug delivery and gene transfection.

Starch: Starch is an inexpensive biodegradable biopolymer and copious in supply. Nanofibers and microfibers can be added to the polymer to increase the mechanical properties of starch improving elasticity and strength. Without the fibers, starch has poor mechanical properties due to its sensitivity to moisture. Starch being biodegradable and renewable is used for many applications including plastics and pharmaceutical tablets.

Cellulose: Cellulose is very structured with stacked chains that result in stability and strength. The strength and stability comes from the straighter shape of cellulose caused by glucose monomers joined by glycogen bonds. The straight shape allows the molecules to pack closely. Cellulose is very common in application due to its abundant supply, its biocompatibility, and is environmentally friendly. Cellulose is used vastly in the form of nano-fibrils called nano-cellulose. Nano-cellulose presented at low concentrations produces a transparent gel material. This material can be used for biodegradable, homogeneous, dense films that are very useful in the biomedical field.

Alginate: Alginate is the most copious marine natural polymer derived from brown seaweed. Alginate biopolymer applications range from packaging, textile and food industry to biomedical and chemical engineering. The first ever application of alginate was in the form of wound dressing, where its gel-like and absorbent properties were discovered. When applied to wounds, alginate produces a protective gel layer that is optimal for healing and tissue regeneration, and keeps a stable temperature environment. Additionally, there have been developments with alginate as a drug delivery medium, as drug release rate can easily be manipulated due to a variety of alginate densities and fibrous composition.

== Biopolymer applications ==

The applications of biopolymers can be categorized under two main fields, which differ due to their biomedical and industrial use.

=== Biomedical ===
Because one of the main purposes for biomedical engineering is to mimic body parts to sustain normal body functions, due to their biocompatible properties, biopolymers are used vastly for tissue engineering, medical devices and the pharmaceutical industry. Many biopolymers can be used for regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, drug delivery, and overall medical applications due to their mechanical properties. They provide characteristics like wound healing, and catalysis of bioactivity, and non-toxicity. Compared to synthetic polymers, which can present various disadvantages like immunogenic rejection and toxicity after degradation, many biopolymers are normally better with bodily integration as they also possess more complex structures, similar to the human body.

More specifically, polypeptides like collagen and silk, are biocompatible materials that are being used in ground-breaking research, as these are inexpensive and easily attainable materials. Gelatin polymer is often used on dressing wounds where it acts as an adhesive. Scaffolds and films with gelatin allow for the scaffolds to hold drugs and other nutrients that can be used to supply to a wound for healing.

As collagen is one of the more popular biopolymers used in biomedical science, here are some examples of their use:

Collagen based drug delivery systems: collagen films act like a barrier membrane and are used to treat tissue infections like infected corneal tissue or liver cancer. Collagen films have all been used for gene delivery carriers which can promote bone formation.

Collagen sponges: Collagen sponges are used as a dressing to treat burn victims and other serious wounds. Collagen based implants are used for cultured skin cells or drug carriers that are used for burn wounds and replacing skin.

Collagen as haemostat: When collagen interacts with platelets it causes a rapid coagulation of blood. This rapid coagulation produces a temporary framework so the fibrous stroma can be regenerated by host cells. Collagen based haemostat reduces blood loss in tissues and helps manage bleeding in organs such as the liver and spleen.

Chitosan is another popular biopolymer in biomedical research. Chitosan is derived from chitin, the main component in the exoskeleton of crustaceans and insects and the second most abundant biopolymer in the world. Chitosan has many excellent characteristics for biomedical science. Chitosan is biocompatible, it is highly bioactive, meaning it stimulates a beneficial response from the body, it can biodegrade which can eliminate a second surgery in implant applications, can form gels and films, and is selectively permeable. These properties allow for various biomedical applications of chitosan.

Chitosan as drug delivery: Chitosan is used mainly with drug targeting because it has potential to improve drug absorption and stability. In addition, chitosan conjugated with anticancer agents can also produce better anticancer effects by causing gradual release of free drug into cancerous tissue.

Chitosan as an anti-microbial agent: Chitosan is used to stop the growth of microorganisms. It performs antimicrobial functions in microorganisms like algae, fungi, bacteria, and gram-positive bacteria of different yeast species.

Chitosan composite for tissue engineering: Chitosan powder blended with alginate is used to form functional wound dressings. These dressings create a moist, biocompatible environment which aids in the healing process. This wound dressing is also biodegradable and has porous structures that allows cells to grow into the dressing. Furthermore, thiolated chitosans (see thiomers) are used for tissue engineering and wound healing, as these biopolymers are able to crosslink via disulfide bonds forming stable three-dimensional networks.

=== Industrial ===
Food: Biopolymers are being used in the food industry for things like packaging, edible encapsulation films and coating foods. Polylactic acid (PLA) is very common in the food industry due to is clear color and resistance to water. However, most polymers have a hydrophilic nature and start deteriorating when exposed to moisture. Biopolymers are also being used as edible films that encapsulate foods. These films can carry things like antioxidants, enzymes, probiotics, minerals, and vitamins. The food consumed encapsulated with the biopolymer film can supply these things to the body.

Packaging: The most common biopolymers used in packaging are polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), polylactic acid (PLA), and starch. Starch and PLA are commercially available and biodegradable, making them a common choice for packaging. However, their barrier properties (either moisture-barrier or gas-barrier properties) and thermal properties are not ideal. Hydrophilic polymers are not water resistant and allow water to get through the packaging which can affect the contents of the package. Polyglycolic acid (PGA) is a biopolymer that has great barrier characteristics and is now being used to correct the barrier obstacles from PLA and starch.

Water purification: Chitosan has been used for water purification. It is used as a flocculant that only takes a few weeks or months rather than years to degrade in the environment. Chitosan purifies water by chelation. This is the process in which binding sites along the polymer chain bind with the metal ions in the water forming chelates. Chitosan has been shown to be an excellent candidate for use in storm and wastewater treatment.

== As materials ==
Some biopolymers- such as PLA, naturally occurring zein, and poly-3-hydroxybutyrate can be used as plastics, replacing the need for polystyrene or polyethylene based plastics.

Some plastics are now referred to as being &#x27;degradable&#x27;, &#x27;oxy-degradable&#x27; or &#x27;UV-degradable&#x27;. This means that they break down when exposed to light or air, but these plastics are still primarily (as much as 98 per cent) oil-based and are not currently certified as &#x27;biodegradable&#x27; under the European Union directive on Packaging and Packaging Waste (94/62/EC). Biopolymers will break down, and some are suitable for domestic composting.

Biopolymers (also called renewable polymers) are produced from biomass for use in the packaging industry. Biomass comes from crops such as sugar beet, potatoes, or wheat: when used to produce biopolymers, these are classified as non food crops. These can be converted in the following pathways:

Sugar beet &gt; Glyconic acid &gt; Polyglyconic acid

Starch &gt; (fermentation) &gt; Lactic acid &gt; Polylactic acid (PLA)

Biomass &gt; (fermentation) &gt; Bioethanol &gt; Ethene &gt; Polyethylene

Many types of packaging can be made from biopolymers: food trays, blown starch pellets for shipping fragile goods, thin films for wrapping.

===Environmental impacts===
Biopolymers can be sustainable, carbon neutral and are always renewable, because they are made from plant or animal materials which can be grown indefinitely. Since these materials come from agricultural crops, their use could create a sustainable industry. In contrast, the feedstocks for polymers derived from petrochemicals will eventually deplete. In addition, biopolymers have the potential to cut carbon emissions and reduce CO2 quantities in the atmosphere: this is because the CO2 released when they degrade can be reabsorbed by crops grown to replace them: this makes them close to carbon neutral.

Almost all biopolymers are biodegradable in the natural environment: they are broken down into CO2 and water by microorganisms. These biodegradable biopolymers are also compostable: they can be put into an industrial composting process and will break down by 90% within six months. Biopolymers that do this can be marked with a &#x27;compostable&#x27; symbol, under European Standard EN 13432 (2000). Packaging marked with this symbol can be put into industrial composting processes and will break down within six months or less. An example of a compostable polymer is PLA film under 20μm thick: films which are thicker than that do not qualify as compostable, even though they are &quot;biodegradable&quot;. In Europe there is a home composting standard and associated logo that enables consumers to identify and dispose of packaging in their compost heap.

<text>The 2001 United Kingdom general election was held on Thursday 7 June 2001, four years after the previous election on 1 May 1997, to elect 659 members to the House of Commons. The governing Labour Party led by Prime Minister Tony Blair was re-elected to serve a second term in government with another landslide victory with a 165-seat majority, returning 412 members of Parliament versus 418 from the previous election, a net loss of six seats, although with a significantly lower turnout than before—59.4%, compared to 71.6% at the previous election. 

The number of votes Labour received fell by nearly three million. Blair went on to become the only Labour prime minister to serve two consecutive full terms in office. As Labour retained almost all of their seats won in the 1997 landslide victory, the media dubbed the 2001 election &quot;the quiet landslide&quot;. There was little change outside Northern Ireland, with 620 out of the 641 seats in Great Britain electing candidates from the same party as they did in 1997. A strong economy contributed to the Labour victory.

The opposition Conservative Party under William Hague&#x27;s leadership was still deeply divided on the issue of Europe and the party&#x27;s policy platform had drifted considerably to the right. The party put the issue of European monetary union, in particular the prospect of the UK joining the Eurozone, at the centre of its campaign but failed to resonate with the electorate. The Conservatives briefly had a narrow lead in the polls during the 2000 fuel strikes but Labour successfully resolved them by year end. Furthermore, a series of publicity stunts that backfired also harmed Hague, and he immediately announced his resignation as party leader when the election result was clear, formally stepping down three months later, therefore becoming the first leader of the Conservative Party in the House of Commons since Austen Chamberlain nearly eighty years prior not to serve as prime minister.

The election was largely a repeat of the 1997 general election, with Labour losing only six seats overall and the Conservatives making a net gain of one seat (gaining nine seats but losing eight). The Conservatives gained a seat in Scotland, which ended the party&#x27;s status as an &quot;England-only&quot; party in the prior parliament, but failed again to win any seats in Wales. Although they did not gain many seats, three of the few new MPs elected were future Conservative Prime Ministers David Cameron and Boris Johnson and future Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne; Osborne would serve in the same Cabinet as Cameron from 2010 to 2016. The Liberal Democrats led by Charles Kennedy made a net gain of six seats.

Change was seen in Northern Ireland, with the moderate unionist Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) losing four seats to the more hardline Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). A similar transition appeared in the nationalist community, with the moderate Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) losing votes to the more staunchly republican and abstentionist Sinn Féin.

Exceptionally low voter turnout, which fell below 60% for the first time since 1918, also marked this election. The election was broadcast live on BBC One and presented by David Dimbleby, Jeremy Paxman, Andrew Marr, Peter Snow, and Tony King. The 2001 general election was notable for being the first in which pictures of the party logos appeared on the ballot paper. Prior to this, the ballot paper had only displayed the candidate&#x27;s name, address, and party name. 

Notable departing MPs included former Prime Ministers Edward Heath (also Father of the House) and John Major, former Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine, former Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown, former Cabinet ministers Tony Benn, Tom King, John Morris, Mo Mowlam, John MacGregor and Peter Brooke, Teresa Gorman, and then Mayor of London Ken Livingstone.

==Background==
The elections were marked by voter apathy, with turnout falling to 59.4%, the lowest (and first under 70%) since the Coupon Election of 1918. Throughout the election the Labour Party had maintained a significant lead in the opinion polls and the result was deemed to be so certain that some bookmakers paid out for a Labour majority before election day. However, the opinion polls the previous autumn had shown the first Tory lead (though only by a narrow margin) in the opinion polls for eight years as they benefited from the public anger towards the government over the fuel protests which had led to a severe shortage of motor fuel.

By the end of 2000, however, the dispute had been resolved and Labour were firmly back in the lead of the opinion polls. In total, a mere 29 parliamentary seats changed hands at the 2001 Election.

2001 also saw the rare election of an independent. Richard Taylor of Independent Kidderminster Hospital and Health Concern (usually now known simply as &quot;Health Concern&quot;) unseated a government MP, David Lock, in Wyre Forest. There was also a high vote for British National Party leader Nick Griffin in Oldham West and Royton, in the wake of recent race riots in the town of Oldham.

In Northern Ireland, the election was far more dramatic and marked a move by unionists away from support for the Good Friday Agreement, with the moderate unionist Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) losing to the more hardline Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). This polarisation was also seen in the nationalist community, with the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) vote losing out to more left-wing and republican Sinn Féin. It also saw a tightening of the parties as the small UK Unionist Party lost its only seat.

==Campaign==
The election had been expected on 3 May, to coincide with local elections, but on 2 April 2001, the local elections were postponed to 7 June because of rural movement restrictions imposed in response to the foot-and-mouth outbreak that had started in February.

On 8 May, Prime Minister Tony Blair announced that the general election would be held on the 7 June as expected, on the same day as the local elections. Blair made the announcement in a speech at St Saviour&#x27;s and St Olave&#x27;s Church of England School in Bermondsey, London rather than on the steps of Downing Street.

For Labour, the last four years had run relatively smoothly. The party had successfully defended all their by election seats, and many suspected a Labour win was inevitable from the start.

Many in the party, however, were afraid of voter apathy, which was epitomised in a poster of &quot;Hague with Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s hair&quot;, captioned &quot;Get out and vote. Or they get in.&quot; Despite recessions in mainland Europe and the United States, due to the bursting of global tech bubbles, Britain was notably unaffected and Labour however could rely on a strong economy as unemployment continued to decline toward election day, putting to rest any fears of a Labour government putting the economic situation at risk.

For William Hague, however, the Conservative Party had still not fully recovered from the loss in 1997. The party was still divided over Europe, and talk of a referendum on joining the Eurozone was rife, and as a result &quot;Save The Pound&quot; was one of the key slogans deployed in the Conservatives&#x27; campaign. As Labour remained at the political centre, the Conservatives moved to the right. A policy gaffe by Oliver Letwin over public spending cuts left the party with an own goal that Labour soon exploited.

Thatcher gave a speech to the Conservative Election Rally in Plymouth on 22 May 2001, calling New Labour &quot;rootless, empty, and artificial.&quot; She also added to Hague&#x27;s troubles when speaking out strongly against the Euro to applause. Hague himself, although a witty performer at Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions, was dogged in the press and reminded of his speech, given at the age of 16, at the 1977 Conservative Conference. &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper only added to the Conservatives&#x27; woes by backing Labour for a second consecutive election, calling Hague a &quot;dead parrot&quot; during the Conservative Party&#x27;s conference in October 1998.

The Conservatives campaigned on a strongly right-wing platform, emphasising the issues of Europe, immigration and tax, the fabled &quot;Tebbit Trinity&quot;. They also released a poster showing a heavily pregnant Tony Blair, stating &quot;Four years of Labour and he still hasn&#x27;t delivered&quot;. However, Labour countered by asking where the proposed tax cuts were going to come from, and decried the Tory policy as &quot;cut here, cut there, cut everywhere&quot;, in reference to the widespread belief that the Conservatives would make major cuts to public services in order to fund tax cuts. Labour also capitalised on the strong economic conditions of the time, and another major line of attack (primarily directed towards Michael Portillo, now Shadow Chancellor after returning to Parliament via a by-election) was to warn of a return to &quot;Tory Boom and Bust&quot; under a Conservative administration.

Charles Kennedy contested his first election as leader of the Liberal Democrats.

During the election Sharron Storer, a resident of Birmingham, criticised Prime Minister Tony Blair in front of television cameras about conditions in the National Health Service. The widely televised incident happened on 16 May during a campaign visit by Blair to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham. Sharron Storer&#x27;s partner, Keith Sedgewick, a cancer patient with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and therefore highly susceptible to infection, was being treated at the time in the bone marrow unit, but no bed could be found for him and he was transferred to the casualty unit for his first 24 hours. On the evening of the same day Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott punched a protestor after being hit by an egg on his way to an election rally in Rhyl, North Wales.

==Endorsements==
* Labour received endorsements from &quot;The Sun&quot;, &quot;The Times,&quot; and &quot;The Daily Express&quot; (The Express for the first time in its history), &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot;, &quot;The Financial Times&quot;, &quot;The Economist&quot;, and &quot;The Guardian&quot;.
* &quot;The Independent&quot; endorsed Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
* The Conservatives were endorsed by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;.

==Opinion polling==


==Results==
The election result was effectively a repeat of 1997, as the Labour Party retained an overwhelming majority, with the BBC announcing the victory at 02:58 on the early morning of 8 June. Having presided over relatively serene political, economic and social conditions, the feeling of prosperity in the United Kingdom had been maintained into the new millennium, and Labour would have a free hand to assert its ideals in the subsequent parliament. Despite the victory, voter apathy was a major issue, as turnout fell below 60%, 12 percentage points down on 1997. All three of the main parties saw their total votes fall, with Labour&#x27;s total vote dropping by 2.8 million on 1997, the Conservatives 1.3 million, and the Liberal Democrats 428,000. Some suggested this dramatic fall was a sign of the general acceptance of the status quo and the likelihood of Labour&#x27;s majority remaining unassailable.

For the Conservatives, the huge loss they had sustained in 1997 was repeated. Despite gaining nine seats, they lost seven to the Liberal Democrats, and one even to Labour (South Dorset). William Hague was quick to announce his resignation, doing so at 07:44 outside the Conservative Party headquarters. Some believed that Hague had been unlucky; although most considered him to be a talented orator and an intelligent statesman, he had come up against the charismatic Tony Blair in the peak of his political career, and it was no surprise that little progress was made in reducing Labour&#x27;s majority after a relatively smooth parliament.

Staying at what they considered rock bottom, however, showed that the Conservatives had failed to improve their negative public image, had remained somewhat disunited over Europe, and had not regained the trust that they had lost in the 1990s. Hague&#x27;s focus on the &quot;Save The Pound&quot; campaign narrative had failed to gain any traction; Labour&#x27;s successful countertactic was to be repeatedly vague over the issue of future monetary union – and said that the UK would only consider joining the Eurozone &quot;when conditions were right&quot;. But in Scotland, despite flipping one seat from the Scottish National Party, their vote collapse continued. They failed to retake former strongholds in Scotland as the Nationalists consolidated their grip on the Northeastern portion of the country.

The Liberal Democrats could point to steady progress under their new leader, Charles Kennedy, gaining more seats than the main two parties—albeit only six overall—and maintaining the performance of a pleasing 1997 election, where the party had doubled its number of seats from 20 to 46. While they had yet to become electable as a government, they underlined their growing reputation as a worthwhile alternative to Labour and Conservative, offering plenty of debate in Parliament and representing more than a mere protest vote.

The SNP failed to gain any new seats and lost a seat to the Conservatives by just 79 votes. In Wales, Plaid Cymru both gained a seat from Labour and lost one to them.

In Northern Ireland the Ulster Unionists, despite gaining North Down, lost five other seats.

&quot;The seat gains reflect changes on the 1997 general election result. Two seats had changed hands in by-elections in the intervening period. These were as follows:&quot;
* &quot;Romsey from Conservative to Liberal Democrats. The Liberal Democrats held this seat in 2001.&quot;
* &quot;South Antrim from Ulster Unionists to Democratic Unionists. The Ulster Unionists won this seat back in 2001.&quot;

The results of the election give a Gallagher index of dis-proportionality of 17.74.
